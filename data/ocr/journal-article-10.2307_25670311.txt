W. F. Hegel in Introduction to Hegel s Philoso phy of History (1948), to his philosophically inventive study on the relation between Hegel's Phenomenology and The Science of Logic, namely, Logic and Existence (1953), to his critical comparison of Hegel and Karl Marx on the philosophy of history, Studies in Marx and Hegel (1955), Jean Hyppolite dis plays remarkable breadth and intelligence. One discovers a program of thought that is at once exegetic, historical, and philosophical. In his analyses of the state, freedom, tragedy, theology, and even a certain materiality central to the Hegelian notion of 'life', Hyppolite reveals a number of secrets buried in speculative idealism.1 However, given his diverse studies and the myriad dimensions of their themes, one finds an uncanny pattern strung through his entire corpus; a limit, an impasse, an uncrossable boundary reveals itself at various moments. The impasse concerns the problem of an authentically speculative form of his torical temporalization. A consideration of this mode of temporalization can help us frame the problem of epochal transformation in Hegel's final overture? the passage to 'absolute knowing', the 'absolute spirit' or the 'absolute idea'. This darkest and deepest enigma in Hegel is a great void. It is a void that deter mined subsequent limits and barriers in the history of continental philosophy; from Karl Marx to Friedrich Nietzsche to Martin Heidegger to Michel Foucault, the problem of the void of 'absolute knowing' has been filled, avoided, or even voided, as if in an attempt to delete the problem itself.2 The history of Hegelian scholarship, and those who have studied Hegel, can attest to various reasons why 'absolute knowing' presents itself as an abyss.3 This is precisely where the work of Hyppolite plays such a critical role. Hyppolite opens up the seemingly infinitesimal complexity of 'absolute know ing' in relation to the whole of the Phenomenology, no doubt, this includes the Phenomenology's function?as a transition?within the entire Hegelian cor pus. Thus, a particular moment in a philosophical system is imbued with a gen eral ontological significance concerning the fundamental question of metaphys ics: time vs. eternity.4 Hyppolite's work constitutes a specific philosophical ho rizon in itself: we shall call it the horizon of temporalization, which guides the</page><page sequence="3">38 RAJESH SAMPATH ontological problem of epochal transformation.5 The ontological problem con cerns interrelation: the relation between a relation and its terms (the temporalization of the question of the epoch and the temporalization of the pos sibility of its solution). The interrelation determines (1) the hidden potentiality within Hegelian scholarship, the passage from the threefold dialectic to another sense of time, being, logic, event, movement, a passage beyond the time/eter nity distinction heralded in the history of metaphysics, and (2) the passage be yond the limits of deconstruction concerning the problem of epochal transfor mation (namely, the closure, which is not eschaton or end). We speak of a double passage, or the relation between two passages. This in-between has its own sense of time and movement, which is not oppositional, and it is incapable of being subsumed into the vast and complicated critiques of metaphysics propelled by deconstruction. Rather, the interrelation constitutes the singular logic of its own event, which in turn determines its potentiality of/as movement. Before we con sider the problem of historical temporalization and interrelation, let us examine certain aspects of Hyppolite's interpretations of Hegel. We want to establish a minimal conceptual context within which to situate Hyppolite's most salient remarks on 'absolute knowing', so that our main question concerning the prob lem of epochal transformation can be elaborated. Hypothesis In the Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel negates, preserves, and carries on mo ments of 'spirit' in the complex movement of the dialectic: it is pretty much the history of everything leading up to Hegel's own moment?from ancient Greek metaphysics to Scholastic religion to the classical forms of reason and science (from the seventeenth century on) to the Enlightenment to revolutionary thought to German idealism to romanticism (art).6 Hegel's synthesis still elicits wonder and awe. Somehow the obscure event of 'absolute knowing' occurs; but the occurrence is irreducible to the dialectical interplay between all of these mo ments and their repressed opposites. Its occurrence can be thought of as an event of a culminating synthesis and a passage, a transformation, a movement be yond, which does not fall prey to the back-and-forth movement of the dialectic, particularly, the endless oscillation of opposites sundered and restored in the history of the development of 'spirit' (ancient Greek metaphysics to German idealism and romanticism). Absolute knowing?as an event?would surpass the distinction between time and eternity, finite and infinite, end and endless ness, in short, all cosmological antinomies. If it is truly beyond any distinction, then the duplicity of absolute knowing becomes problematic: How does it con stitute a unified synthesis and a passage beyond any synthetic compound that is reduced to the status of an abstract predicate (i.e., the forms of metaphysics,</page><page sequence="4">Re-Spiriting Hegel 39 religion, natural science, art)? How can something be not only an end, but also a passage beyond the distinction between origin and end, in all of its metaphysi cal disguises?7 What is this twoness?this and thafi Just because absolute knowing can be conceived in this way?as an end of history and a movement beyond all determinations within that history?does not mean that it actually is this way. It is not apparent in any way; it is not this way, mode, or substance explicitly defined or covertly proffered.8 The event of absolute knowing cannot operate by the law of dialectical movement?or the succession of any previous/existing form and its opposite?to this other realm. Then again, it is because it has transcended these moments that it has the power to institute its own law of movement, which would no longer be part of a three moment dialectic (negation, negation of negation, synthesis). It is free to create beyond any antinomy even though the horizon of its creation remains unarticulated. This is precisely why the movement of 'spirit' is not simply a culminating end (which absorbs all previous moments or shapes) or a hopeful continuation, an endless progress toward a realm beyond actual comprehension. Neither an end nor an endless continuation, neither a culminating synthesis nor an unnameable passage to a beyond, whose movement remains undecided, the event of absolute knowing remains without its form revealed. Rather, this event remains unactualized, for it would like to surpass even itself (or all previous moments contained within its dominion) while giving form to its own law of living movement?a law, nevertheless, that is irreducible to the ubiquitous three moment dialectic that tore through history. The event of this form does not take the form of a singular event, as have the events of all forms that came and went in history. The movement proper to absolute knowing does not appear because the movements proper to previous shapes (ancient, Christian, modern) have sub mitted themselves to a dialectical movement. And in instituting itself, the dia lectical movement has failed to transcend itself. When it comes to spirit think ing its simple notion, the event of thinking itself is sabotaged by an oscillation between hopeful transcendence and hopeless repetition. The relation between the absolute notion of 'spirit' and the event of thinking the notion as such usurps the possibility of the occurrence of absolute knowing. This is a difficult condition for the event of absolute knowing to withstand. It is precarious for two reasons: on the one hand, absolute knowing of 'spirit' admits to being determined by all of its previous moments or shapes (the history of everything); on the other hand, it seeks to transcend all of that history by delivering a form of passage itself, which is irreducible to the death-birth forms of previous systems (ancient cycles, Christian eschatology, and modern endless progress) in and of history. But if it is not any of these modes of passage, move ment, or even time, and if it refuses to give in to an impalpable Other beyond all formulation, if it seeks to comprehend itself in this Other while truly transcend ing any particular moment and its logic of movement, then two negative condi tions assert themselves: First, absolute knowing cannot remain with a certain</page><page sequence="5">40 RAJESH SAMPATH insufferable oscillation: a swing between staying/remaining with all of its pre vious moments in the historical movement of their unfree destiny (metaphysics, religion, philosophy, science, art) and assuming naively a passage to a beyond, which cannot determine itself according to its own nonderivative conception of movement. Second, absolute knowing cannot admit to the hidden simultaneity of being part of a dual possibility: a culminating synthesis of the history of every thing and a passage beyond all historical determination and laws of movement (ancient cycles, Christian eschatology, modern endless duration). Given this double resistance of absolute knowing against its own two negative conditions, the ques tion of the 'absolute spirit' is neither dead nor alive; it is an in-between. This is where Hyppolite's reflections serve as clues or points of departure for our own speculative advancement of the question of epochal transformation. Nei ther a teleological incompletion that strove for an original completion nor Derrida's de facto completion that sanctifies its non-original incompletion (closure), abso lute knowing is characterized by obscure singularity; walled up within its secret, trapped within its crypt, we search for an escape to the outside. We seek the abso lute concept itself precisely when no concept seems possible, but it is a concept that is neither discovered nor received. As an event that gives birth to its own logic of movement, it is absolutely irreducible to the history of metaphysics, philoso phy, religion, science, and art. In other words, it is irreducible to the metaphysics of presence, which perturbs some people. It is where the legacy of Hegel could not go, but it is also where the critique of Hegel's failure becomes obsolete. For how can one assail something that surpasses the conditions by which one assails, de stroys, or even deconstructs Hegel, or anyone else for that matter? Or, rather, how do the conditions require a supersession, whose event admits to the self-destruc tion of deconstruction while giving birth to some Other? The event does not shy away from itself, masking itself in an endless set of questions, for it must defeat any kind of eternity?the eternity of time and movement (absolute duration) or the eternal immobility against the metaphysics of time and movement. It calls out to itself to call itself out; it is neither temporal nor eternal, in all of these terms' positive and negative manifestations in the history of metaphysics and the secret event of that history's closure. Thus, it is neither an end nor an endless deferral and repetition: it happens as another event entirely. The torturous condition of absolute knowing becomes apparent. It tries to resolve itself in Hegel, but remains unresolved; it tries to defer or dispense with resolution in Derrida, but remains implicitly resolved as "eternally undecided." Beyond these two conditions, however, another possibility asserts itself, though this other possibility is troubled with the secret simultaneity embedded in the conditions of absolute knowing: the enigma of the absolute's event is that of the revelation of a totally original form and an original process (or movement) of revealing that which constitutes what is original about the event. It is the hidden simultaneity in the duality or duplicity of the original form and the original movement or process of revealing what constitutes an original form. And this</page><page sequence="6">Re-Spiriting Hegel 41 possibility (which is neither eschatological nor Derridian) is unhappy with the implicit simultaneity of being two?this and that. It is not satisfied with being both its original form revealed and its own original process (or movement) of revealing what it is: the simple absolute concept of 'spirit' comprehended in and for itself. For we are dealing with the self-showing of time itself beyond any metaphysical form and the antinomy that any form hides: coexistence vs. suc cession, for instance (i.e., Kantian substance). This self-comprehended event is not a particular philosophical shape in history (cycle, end, endlessness) because it has transcended any cosmological shape in being able to articulate what it means to be beyond; and this beyond is not the 'beyond' of religion, metaphys ics, or even science.9 Hegel speaks of a concrete, living 'notion'. Rather, the event of absolute knowing is beyond the 'beyond', if you will, which does not elude the power of reason to create for itself; it does not have to wait to be discovered or imposed from some outside force (God, alien, etc.). Inversely, the self-comprehending event is nothing other than the self-comprehension of the whole of history (and thus the historicity of history); but this comprehension is bound up with the event of determining itself free of the charge or obligation to overcome itself into a beyond that resists comprehension (indecision, closure, heaven, etc.). Split between these two possibilities, absolute knowing opens itself up. Hyppolite's Genesis and Structure ofHegeVs Phenomenology of Spirit (1946) provides a glimpse of this opening. Main Text "Absolute Knowing" comes at the end of a massive commentary of Hegel's Phenomenology, which is not simply faithful exegesis or strident destruction/ deconstruction. Just like Hegel's first great work, Hyppolite's commentary has its moments. First, Hyppolite gives a statement on what he thinks is the "central problem of the Phenomenology of Spirit" (1974, 596). He says, The reconciliation of finite spirit and infinite spirit expressed in this last pas sage [of dialectical movement] is absolute knowledge itself, a knowledge which is simultaneously the knowledge that the absolute has of itself and that of this finite spirit which raises itself to universal self-consciousness. This encounter between a nontemporal infinite spirit and temporal humanity in the 1=1, an encounter which alone makes absolute spirit, is the central problem of the Phenomenology of Spirit. (596) Embedded in this passage is a four-dimensional determination that inhabits the problem of an "encounter," and thus a relation. The relation is between two terms: the absolute's knowledge of itself and the finite spirit raising itself to</page><page sequence="7">42 RAJESH SAMPATH universal self-consciousness. But then one can say that each of these poles har bors a relation: the absolute's knowledge of the relation between its 'self and its 'self-knowledge' and the finite spirit's relation to a new possibility of be coming/raising itself to universal consciousness. Since we are within absolute knowing, the relation between these two internal relations cannot be conceived on the basis of the metaphysical horizons of the history of history (ancient, Chris tian, modern); however, since it has its own logic of movement, of which these horizons are only moments, the possibility of asserting its own concept persists. And this event takes the form of an encounter between the nontemporal infinite and the temporally finite, while the encounter?or event itself?happens as an interrelation. Yet, since the nature of the encounter (event) resists the particular forms of history while instituting itself as its own origin, the interrelation through which it happens is not a thing in itself. It can be neither temporal nor eternal; then again, it cannot hide its secret in the unnameable, which is endlessly de ferred. The interrelation relates to the problem of the historicity of history itself. Thus, one can ask, what exactly is the inter, the ambiguous relation between the two relations?or the encounter between the temporal (concept) becoming the eternal (infinite 'spirit') and the eternal (concept) finding itself within the tem poral (historical humanity)? Relativity splits the implicit simultaneity of the relation between the two relations (the absolute's knowledge of itself and the finite's raising of itself to universal being). The event of the interrelation is neither simultaneous nor suc cessive. The split of simultaneity within the interrelation (the relation between the relations) is the movement of passage. Thus, beneath the 1=1 of absolute knowing is a deeper problem. This problem's shape seems to have eluded both Hegel, who proffered its possibility, and Derrida, who incarnated the impossi bility of divulging its secret, for it cannot simply temporalize its horizon on the basis of a pre-Derridian, eternal Hegelianism free from the critique of meta physics and an endless, post-Derridian resistance to the resurrection of meta physics. It is not an event, a form, a movement, a thing, a being, a revelation in the history of metaphysics and the metaphysical notion of history (historicity). Rather, we speak of an event-movement-interrelation. The secret is the split within the simultaneity of two relations, which releases an unheard-of move ment; and this self-created original movement is only the movement of splitting the two relations. Thus, the split relation between the absolute's relation to its self-knowledge and the finite's relation to its becoming/raising to the universal becomes the question of another form of passage; this mode of becoming is 'absolute knowledge'. We do not pass into absolute knowledge as if it were a stage in an unchanging structure that predetermines a specific relation between time and being; it is not determined by the epochal horizons of time (ancient cycle, Christian eschatology, modern endless duration). Then again, it refuses the de facto eternity, which hides in the deferral of a final form or incessant negativity. No circular time, no theological eschatology, no endless duration, no</page><page sequence="8">Re-Spiriting Hegel 43 terminal point, no negative dialectics, no repetition/overcoming, no post-, no spatialized quantity can help us intuit this mode of becoming the split move ment. And the intuition of this mode does not tarry away with the two standing options: the possibility of transcending the history of metaphysics and the im possibility of arriving at a form other than the metaphysical conception of time based on a particular historical construction (ancient, Christian, modern). Rather, it tears asunder the polarization between this possibility and impossibility; it suspends their difference, but not indefinitely.10 It temporalizes the very ques tion of transition (passage) in a completely unheard-of movement, and this it self is the event of transition from the history of metaphysics and the metaphysi cal-epochal forms of history (ancient, Christian, modern) to the nonderivative event of absolute knowing. The logic of the event awaits its articulation. Move ment is this articulation's self-production. Thus, self-production results in nei ther a self ('absolute spirit' as God) nor the negation of self (deferral/difference as the eclipse of substance). This interrelational form of movement, which appears to be final and ultimate, namely, the interrelation embedded in absolute knowing, risks a certain reduction to religion; it risks the resurrection of a religious entity, whose transuniversal scope is subject to question. It raises the dubious prospect that one can answer the question of the historicity of history (including its time-horizons, ancient, Christian, and modern). However, surpassing/sublating a religious consciousness that would like to deliver up the ultimate form or withdraw it in the name of faith and law means surpassing the relation between religion and philosophy. It means surpassing the last traces of any relation between religion and philosophy (including de facto nega tive theologies).11 The interrelational movement (the split-passage of two relations that is 'absolute knowledge') accomplishes the supersession of the relation between philosophy and religion, for both theology and metaphysics are plunged into a deeper enigma, beyond any ontological relation or nonrelation between time and being. We would destroy the fundamental problem of the event of Hegel's dialectic and the problem of the post-Hegelian event (which for Nietzsche is the threshold, for Heidegger the Ereignis, and for Derrida closure) if we conflated the question of the interrelation with some final form (a new religion). Likewise, we would abolish the problem of transcendence for Hegel, and even the ontological Heidegger, if we simply announced the eternal deferral of any final form, and thus any concept of time (and being): the closure, or the problem of the end of metaphysics, or what comes after philosophy. The time will come when time will be revealed. Instead, the problem is to inhabit the event from within, imploding all of its impediments, seiz ing its greatest possibility to reveal the question that it has designed for itself: the self-originating movement of a quadruplicity known as the interrelation. Hyppolite gives us another sign that indicates the fundamental risk of pursu ing absolute knowledge, a risk that entails the possibility of a double slippage: a collapse back into a new theological form, albeit distinct from other forms handed down from history, and the decision against any onto-theological form in the</page><page sequence="9">44 RAJESH SAMPATH name of historicity and the finite. For Hyppolite, the problem of absolute know ing seems insoluble: How can a knowledge which of itself is atemporal, absolute knowledge, have temporal conditions in the existence and development of a humanity. There is not in Hegelianism a clear solution to these problems, and it is on these points that the great Hegelian synthesis will tend to come apart in the hands of Hegel's disciples. (1974, 596) Regardless of how one interprets this passage, some form of the time/eternity distinction remains; even the most subtle and inconspicuous interpretation can still not avoid the so-called paradox, which is deemed so problematic, even insoluble. If a synthesis is not possible, then divergences, differences, failures open up (Nietzsche to Derrida). However, beyond the various possibilities of play ing with the time/eternity distinction is the question of historical time. This is not just our historical present, but the entire problem of the historicity of all of history's temporal forms (and shapes of consciousness). The problem of the historicity of history as a whole implies the construction of a finite being, but this finite being is beyond any derivation of the anthropologically finite (human being) from an infi nite concept (religion/science). However, the invention is irreducible to any subsumption of the infinite question (absolute knowing) into an unsubstantiated finite formlessness (trace, Other, etc.), for the latter fails to plumb the depths of time, being, movement, event, transformation, and the historicity of history. The unnameable, which takes the name of the finite, has failed to recognize and incar nate the form of inheritance concerning the question of absolute knowing. The inheritance concerns the question of the phoenix of metaphysics itself in the event that eclipses the distinction between the temporal and the eternal. It concerns the decision of what we humans must do with/to 'absolute knowing'. While one can say that time is equated with history, and the concept is equated with eternity, absolute knowing involves a unity between time and concept, and thus a relation that is, in essence, neither one. However, if we grant this double equation, the history (temporalization) of various attempts to reach the eternal concept, a destined history that has failed to realize the concept of its own short comings with regard to the 'eternal concept', becomes a problem in itself. Thus, one may need something other than time and eternity to grasp the enigma of something called the "history" of philosophical systems of eternity (metaphys ics, religion, science, art), the temporalization of eternity beyond any eternal reduction to an ahistorical concept of time (circles, lines, etc.). This is what the interrelation builds into itself, the possibility of understanding "the history of eternity." The attempt to supersede the time/eternity distinction itself would su persede those forms of thought, which testify to the failure of metaphysics while deferring their own incapacity to own up to the failure, meet it head on, decide its fate, and move themselves to think beyond the 'beyond'. They remain more</page><page sequence="10">Re-Spiriting Hegel 45 or less spectral forms of eternity, endless deferral, for instance. Thus, the inter relation (of Hegel and Derrida) awakens the possibility to think being on the basis of being alone: that is, to be a being other than the being that wills a meta physical form and other than the being that scares itself into not deciding on its own being and world, for the latter form of denial withdraws Being in the wake of an attempted but failed history of metaphysics. In recognizing the conundrum of Hegel's legacy, Hyppolite states, "Absolute knowledge, as a moment of world history, which reconciles this temporal mo ment with a truth which in itself is atemporal, is presented to us in a form so vague as to open the path to diverse interpretations; we are unable to indicate exactly which interpretation constitutes the authentic heritage of Hegelianism" (1974, 600). Deconstruction (dating back to Nietzsche) inherited the inability to constitute Hegel's authentic heritage, but it does not see the inability as some kind of natural defect or fault of its own. Hegel's very attempt is itself unjusti fied, let alone those that want to constitute an authentic heritage. Instead, deconstruction recasts this moment, not as an inherent inability, but as a strate gic battle against any determinate or loaded judgment such as Hyppolite's; the latter presupposes an essential incapacity (or capacity) to decide on the moment of Hegel's eclipse. So one should question why it is even imperative to consti tute an authentic heritage of Hegel. Why bother? If Hegel himself blasted religion's unhappy consciousness (an intuition of the outside, which always ex ceeds itself), the critical circle of the Enlightenment, and the bad infinity of endless progress, then the relation between the unknown Hegel and the interre lation takes us straight back to the problem of absolute knowledge. However, returning inside the event of absolute knowing constitutes a movement beyond the impossible futures of deconstruction. By relating the problem of the interrelation to the double problem of Hegel's incomplete attempt at completion and Derrida's act of completion, which re sults in an essential incompletion, we can make several strategic distinctions. We can elaborate what it means to be in the event of absolute knowing: (1) the mode of existence when universal self-consciousness happens in the finitude of a historical consciousness; (2) the mode of comprehension of the self-existence of the universal in the historical; (3) the mode of actualization of an absolute life (a new form) on the basis of the finite that has transcended all of history's forms (cycles, eschaton, endless duration); and (4) the return back to the recognition of the finite in the universal plenitude of its own singular event. All four of these possibilities spin off and enjoin the relation in the event of absolute knowledge. The abstraction of these formulations seems unbroachable. To get at the event interrelation in the context of familiar thematic problems in the philosophy of history, we can turn to Hyppolite's own theoretical reflections in Studies in Marx and Hegel (1955) and Logic and Existence (1953). In two of his mature philosophical works, Hyppolite raises typical problems in the philosophy of history: the relation or break between Hegel's idealism and</page><page sequence="11">46 RAJESH SAMPATH Marx's dialectical materialism, the end of history, the relation of material praxis to the production of sense in the Logos, the distinction between nature and his tory, and the distinction between nature and society. However, both Studies in Marx and Hegel and Logic and Existence devote substantial sections to the rela tion between Hegel's Phenomenology (1807) and his Science of Logic (1812). During these moments, Hyppolite not only compares and relates 'absolute know ing' in the Phenomenology to the 'absolute idea' in the Logic, but also raises the question of how the relation between these two moments or ideas conditions Hegel's attempt to invent a philosophy of history (see Hyppolite 1969, 169-84; 1997b, 161-89).12 Likewise, Hyppolite reveals that certain aporias and limits fall between 'absolute knowing' and the 'absolute idea'; he shows how and why Hegel fails to ground ontologically a different temporalization of being beyond the shapes or forms of history (ancient, Christian, and modern). Again, the in between, which Hyppolite's commentaries constitute, is situated in two compli cated poles: the possibility of achieving an absolute concept beyond being, es sence, or logos and its impossibility, or the decision against the will to strive for an 'absolute concept'. We come in-between the indecision of a past decision (Hegel) and the decision of future indecisions (deconstruction). In Studies in Marx and Hegel (1955), Hyppolite raises a specific method ological problem concerning Hegel's absolute knowledge. He suggests that the event surpasses in different ways two common perspectives on Hegel's philoso phy and its legacy. On the one hand, Hyppolite questions the idea that Hegel's system simply constitutes another metaphysical attempt at a philosophy of his tory (and being); it is merely a different and renewed teleology that presupposes either some kind of ambiguous finality or an endless perfection of Reason.13 On the other hand, he questions the view that the Hegelian system shows how the history of philosophy (and its insoluble contradictions) prohibits the possibility of transcending that history in another philosophy of time, being, and historic ity, that is, a new philosophy with a horizon other than the ancient, Christian, and modern horizons of thought. Neither accusing Hegel as one who has forgot ten Being nor hailing him as one who recognizes closure, Hyppolite sees an other possibility. For the student of Hegel, these common limits lead to the deep problem of temporality and transition (or passage) in relation to the event/oc currence of absolute knowing: The historian of philosophy might distinguish two lines of thought in Hegelianism. First of all, he might point to a philosophy of history which culminates in what may be called humanism (the most usual consequence of Hegelianism). He might then describe the notion of Absolute Knowledge, which, as the external reflection on philosophies of the past, constitutes no less an internal philosophy of complete immanence in which thought abstracts from Time everything but the external temporality of mediation and thus tran scends history. It is possible to reconcile the Hegelian philosophy of history</page><page sequence="12">Re-Spiriting Hegel 47 (which is strictly a philosophy of human history) with the notion of Absolute Knowledge in the Logic. Perhaps we should adopt the suggestion in the Phe nomenology that we consider history as simply the preparation of Absolute Knowledge, or, in other words, a reflexive logic of philosophy. But that would imply some sort of end to history as we know it, or at least the appearance of an absolutely new phase of history. Absolute Knowledge would at the same time transcend humanism, since self-consciousness only expresses the adven ture of Being, and, as a philosophy of the Absolute, it would itself transcend all history. The identity postulated between Meaning and Being (or the death of God) would inaugurate a new departure to which the notion of history would no longer be proper. (1969, 183) It is interesting to note that if one approaches Hegel from a historical perspec tive, then two possibilities open up. One can say that the two perspectives be come possible when we consider an essential problematic. Central is the task of the historian of philosophy, and thus of the one who determines the nature of finitude by presupposing a certain understanding of time. Given the encounter with Hegelianism, the problematic takes on a specific configuration: How does the temporal horizon of determining the relation between philosophy and his tory in Hegel's Phenomenology even relate to something called the history of philosophy?14 Any history of philosophy presupposes a particular ontological construction of time and change (whether a chronology or a genealogy, continu ity or discontinuity). But when the historicization of Hegel's 'absolute idea' becomes the issue, then two perspectives come to the question of how one con stitutes a history of philosophy. As such, Hyppolite's differentiation of two per spectives raises the problem of temporalizing any historical reflection on Hegel's legacy and reactivating the problems of time, history, and epochal transforma tion that Hegelianism initiates. A reciprocal engagement ensues. From the out set, Hyppolite's point about two perspectives concerns a relation. And it is the event of the relation that is significant prior to the essential determination of the two perspectives. The relation raises the problem of how one temporalizes some thing called "historical finitude" while accounting for the enigmas of time, fini tude, and epochal transformation in Hegelian philosophy, for the latter still ef fect the temporal horizon of the historian and thus the possibility of determining any temporal relation to the history of philosophy. The event of the relation has to do with a decision. As such, the relation is neither buried in Hegel's legacy nor recoverable from the standpoint of a temporally neutral perspective on the history of philosophy, a historiography. One has no choice but to confront Hegel, see what happens, and live with the decision of the outcome. But, unfortunately, there has never been a head-to-head combat with Hegel on the restricted issue of time, movement, epochal transformation, and the event of transcending the historical shapes of history (ancient cycle, Christian eschatology, modern end less duration)?in short, on time in and of 'absolute knowing'.15</page><page sequence="13">48 RAJESH SAMPATH Thus, in considering the horizon of possibilities for the historian's encounter with Hegel, Hyppolite entertains two interpretations. The first perspective sees a philosophy of history, which culminates in a humanism, or the most usual consequence of Hegelianism. In other words, some may see a philosophy of history, such as progress, eschatology, cycles, or a combination thereof. Fur thermore, one may attribute anthropomorphism to the geometric substrate of the philosophy of history. Typically, more thematic and less speculative treat ments of Hegel veer in this direction; no doubt, the battle over the political, the ethical, and the theological, in short, the dimensions of subjectivity, freedom, and the state takes place within this horizon of Hegel scholarship. Whether a philosophy of history is substantiated or set up as an open problematic without resolution, or whether it is dismantled entirely, the point is that Hegelianism presupposes some minimal relation between philosophy and history.16 The second perspective, however, reveals a complex ontological problem. It is not simply the issue of determining the kind of philosophy of history that subsists in the Phenomenology, let alone the system. Then again, it is not the mere apotheosis of a certain critical decision against Hegel: that Hegel's thought represents the impossibility of achieving a self-contained philosophy of history, an impossibility linked to the problem of closure. One can claim that beyond these two maneuvers is a subtle but massive gesture: How does the Phenom enology temporalize its own event in trying to surpass previous philosophical shapes of history (ancient, Christian, enlightened, progressive), and thus attempts to transcend the history of philosophy or thought in general (metaphysics, natu ral science, religion, art)? How does this attempt at self-temporalization evoke a different kind of movement, which is irreducible to anything that has ever been postulated (circular, linear, duration, etc.)? How does a double event in the heart of this chiasmic self-supersession?of the history of philosophy and the phi losophy of history?open up the problem of the event of absolute knowing? How does absolute knowing relate to the historicity of history and philosophy in a movement-event of origination that has never been imagined? To repeat Hyppolite, the notion of absolute knowledge "as the external re flection upon the philosophies of the past, constitutes no less an internal phi losophy of complete immanence in which thought abstracts from Time every thing but the external temporality of mediation and thus transcends history." Taken in its enormous complexity, this event (external reflection, complete im manence, abstraction from time, external temporality/transcendence of history) is irreducible; but it is precisely its irreducibility that beckons the possibility of something called a concrete (absolute) comprehension. Put another way, we can enter the event while thinking our own passage into the event; at the passage, however, we are no longer Cartesian as heretofore conceived. Absolute know ing is a split being. In its split-occurrence, it harbors a different kind of move ment. As an event that imagines the possibility of an external reflection on all past (and thus contemporary) philosophical shapes, as an event that assumes a</page><page sequence="14">Re-Spiriting Hegel 49 suspicious transcendence above any metaphysical time (circular or linear), it actually finds itself in the free-contingent event of complete immanence that reflects from within the whole. But the "within" status of this singular occur rence makes the occurrence well aware of the impossibility of positing itself somewhere (without accounting for the movement it shares with its repressed opposite, nowhere); as such, it is a kind of immanence, which is not simply an immobile "being there," even though it is irreducible to any particular shape of time, locality, being, or movement. It never sinks to the status of an empty predi cate, as in, "it is this." The event has its own unique movement. If the whole can reflect on all of its moments without falsely misapprehending itself as some thing that is not a moment, and thus superior to time itself, then it is also nothing but an antimetaphysical universal: it is a finite temporalization that generates, paradoxically, the external temporality of historical transcendence. The exterior ization from history allows one to awaken from the dead the incomplete moments of previous metaphysical shapes of time's being in history (ancient, Christian, modern). These shapes were not conscious of their own notion; indeed, these shapes did not materialize their own nonderivative event of freedom and thus could not actualize their own singular truth of time and being without recapitulating a secret eternity. But by way of its own self-derived event, absolute knowing can fill up those moments in a movement divorced from any trace of metaphysical determi nation; it is free. Deep inside this event is a type of movement proper to passage, which incarnates in the free event-decision of relating to the historicity of history (ancient, Christian, modern); conceptualizing this movement of a finite Dasein would indeed amount to transcending all previous philosophical shapes of history and thus the history of philosophy. Time finds a form that is completely external to any form in the history of philosophy, but it is history transcended in the free event decision of relating to the historicity of history that actualizes a completely immanent and thus concrete occurrence of the notion. The notion brings itself to life from its dead shapes; it overcomes death itself without being eternal. The concretion of the event is precisely what makes the notion irreducible to any tran scendental, metaphysical, religious, scientific, or artistic form. And yet, if it is not in itself transcendental, and if it is irreducible to the history of philosophy, then how does one characterize its self-determined finitude, its absolute occurrence? How does the event take the place of eternity without slopping back into the dross of its opposite, some (particular) image of time? In considering the event of absolute knowing, the problem of the relation reappears. The four-way relation opens the internal movement of the event of absolute knowing: (1) the possibility of an external reflection on all shapes of time; (2) the origin of this exteriorization within the internal immanence of a finite self-generating temporalization; (3) the difference between the power to abstract from time the contents of time itself, presumably the history of all shapes of being, and the homage to an external temporality of mediation, which is irre ducible to any form or shape; and (4) the self-transcendence of history occur</page><page sequence="15">50 RAJESH SAMPATH ring solely within its own sphere of being as a nonderivative event of movement. The notion of absolute knowing is nothing but the possibility of a self-reflexive logic of passage, a movement of birth and death, derived solely from itself ; it is an event of pure freedom, which would transcend all of history's shapes of time, movement, origin, end, and eternity (or the metaphysics of ancient, Christian, and modern worlds) in the singularity of an immanent transcendence and nowhere else (heaven, Mars, modern Europe, etc.). Its concept would be the concept of the relation between being and time, which is neither time-in-being nor being-in-time. It would be the self-originating event of movement, which has as moments within itself the cosmological antinomies (origin/end, originless/endless) and the eclipse of the antinomies, namely, closure. Thus, this singularity cannot be conceptual ized on the basis of any particular relation between time's three dimensions (past, present, and future) and the possibility or impossibility of movement in and of history. The event is four-dimensional, neither temporality as such nor eternity regained. How we conceptualize the relations within this event will determine the new departure, the rebirth after the death of God, and thus after all possible or impossible postulated relations between meaning and being. Hyppolite, our in-between, gives us some momentary guidance as we travel through the tense inner warp of the event. In his magisterial philosophical inquiry, Logic and Existence (1953), Hyppolite gives us an economically brilliant presenta tion of the relation between Hegel's Phenomenology and the Science of Logic. As he stated in Studies in Marx and Hegel (1969, 183), perhaps we should consider the relation between a philosophy of history, Hegel's Phenomenology, and the Science of Logic. Logic and Existence opens up a number of interesting questions concern ing the relation between language, logic, and the production of 'sense' in Hegel's first two (and, I would say, most significant) philosophical works. Although it was Logic and Existence that may have influenced the post-structuralist generation irre vocably, we will resume pur inquiry at the most extreme limits of Hyppolite's thought, for what lies beyond these limits is something that Hyppolite could not see; as such, the passage beyond is something the post-structuralists did not inherit. Their "step not beyond," the trembling of the passage between these two epochs (Nietzsche/ Heidegger to ?), as Derrida says in Of Grammatology (1976), remains their legacy. However, from within the event, we can see the work of a kindred spirit cut short of its desired destination: the question of absolute knowing resurrects an aborted pos sibility for thinking beyond the "step not beyond." In Logic and Existence, Hyppolite again raises questions: "What is the rela tion between absolute knowledge, the Logos, and this philosophy of history" (1997b, 186). Then, in response to his own question, he states, [AJbsolute knowledge is the ground of the knowledge that appears in history, and history opens this dimension; history is the place of passage from temporal objective spirit to absolute spirit and to Logos. History is the appearance of freedom, that is, the appearance of the concept through which man has access to eternal sense. This sense, however, is not another world behind history. (188)</page><page sequence="16">Re-Spiriting Hegel 51 Absolute knowledge is the ground for any knowledge (and, thus, any shape of philosophy) to appear in history; as a ground that is not part of a transcendental beyond or a metaphysical halo, as a ground that subscribes only to its own law of finitude, it is not in itself an eternal concept of history (cycle, eschatology, progression). The ground activates itself in its own movement, of which other movements are only moments (ancient, Christian, modern). But since the ground is not a nowhere, it is only history that reciprocally reveals or opens this dimen sion. A reciprocal relation is posited. As a free event, the ground is the condition of the possibility of its own original form; paradoxically, this condition is be yond the actualization of possibilities of different forms in the history of history (ancient, Christian, modern) while the historicity of history, the origin beneath any conception of history itself, provides a movement that reveals the possibil ity of the ground. Thus, if history is the appearance of the 'absolute concept' as freedom, then history is also the finite possibility, which gives access to the eternal, even though history itself is never of the order of eternity (God, law, force, metaphysics, etc.). History, as the passage, is neither a temporal moment by way of a particular determination of time (progressive, for instance) nor an eternal figure of theology or metaphysics (the second kingdom of God). It is an event that happens with respect to its own regard; paradoxically, although the event of revelation is not delivered from above, the process of originating the event is irreducible to any particular shape of time and being in history (cycle, line, etc.). Neither immanent nor transcendental, the event opens. With Hyppolite's simple formulation, the great Hegelian paradox seems to remain intact: history is the passage from the temporal to the eternal even though the passage itself is neither an ontic temporality nor a transcendental eternity; it is neither human being nor God. The distinction between the finite and the infinite is superseded. However, if this is the case, any finite or infinite determination of history (as end or endless) cannot remain unmoved with regard to the ground. Thus, history is not the truth of the Logos. Something both between and other than time and eternity proffers itself. Hyppolite then proceeds: This passage from history to absolute knowledge, the passage from the tem poral to the eternal, is Hegelianism's most obscure dialectical synthesis; his tory is self-creating, like the Logos, but this creation is there temporal, here eternal. The Logos is not an essence. It is the element in which being and sense reflect one another, where being appears as sense and sense as being. The Logos is absolute genesis, and time is the image of mediation, not the reverse. Time is the concept, but the concept in its immediate Dasein because time is the exstasis of difference, which in the Logos presents itself as the internal movement of determinations, temporality as eternal. Hegelian eter nity is not an eternity before time, but the mediating thought which presup poses itself absolutely in time. This is why history's objective spirit becomes absolute spirit; this is a becoming which seems to us difficult to conceive as an epoch of world history. (1997b, 188)</page><page sequence="17">52 RAJESH SAMPATH And this is where our inquiry finds its point of departure. Or, rather, we speak of a rebirth in place of a point of origin. But this rebirth is not a resurrection; it is not the raising of something that died, of something that once lived and, hence, had been born. It suspends the distinction between birth and death, while acti vating the intermundia of their relation. If anything, it relates the problem of the rebirth within the death at the heart of the deconstructive aporia; we speak of something that has never been born (like an origin) and thus could not die (like a subject). Inversely, the would-be eternity beyond origin and end is condensed into the singularity of a self-conceptualized passage; as singular, it is irreducible to any onto-theological form, and thus the arch-nemesis of two traditional pos sibilities: the temporalization of eternity (the human God) or the eternity of time (objective or cosmic duration). As its own singular event, it halts the regress of positive and negative interpositions of time and eternity, of time in its other, which is never eternity, and eternity in its other, which is never time. But the halt is not blockage. Rather, it is the self-conceptualization of movement itself; the latter is irreducible to the history of metaphysics and the exasperated meta physics of history, which repels any notion of end (eschaton) or an endless de ferral of the decision (closure) against an absolute end. Movement is divorced from spatialized representation. The relation between the rebirth and the death is the primordial invention of the Other, an origin of origin (and thus end). What is not an epoch of world history is also not eternal or transcendental. It is not that the event defies the power of reason; it is just that the event is not reproduc ible given the modes of comprehension concerning the temporal and eternal, the historical and the second kingdom (religion, science, metaphysics). Returning to Hyppolite's final passage, we must consider a new becoming, another be coming: the event-movement-interrelation-concept, which we shall call four dimensional time.17 But the return admits to one concession: we are not consid ering the solution to Hegel's "most obscure dialectical synthesis." This is not a moment of reconciliation with the 'absolute'. It is more of a decision that abides by its own occurrence. We shall consider a relation, which is the ground of an 'absolute genesis', a creation of creation: a rebirth of Hegel, which is actually an autonomous birth with no origin, and the death of deconstruction, which is actually a decision on the indecision of death without end (eschaton). We can consider the irruptive event of another becoming: this is where time as concept appears, but not as any concept heretofore ordained, promised, or forsaken. The antinomies?origin and end vs. originless and endless?are sublated, which means they are surpassed yet interrelated in a form beyond both. Let us return to the "moments" of Hyppolite's passage. Initially for Hyppolite, "the passage from history to absolute knowledge" is the "passage from the tem poral to the eternal." And this passage is the "dialectic's most obscure synthe sis." But this looks like a type of eschatology, a release from the bondage of time and history after the Fall and a resubmersion back into the eternity of God's hands. Even if it is not a philosophical actualization of Christian eschatology,</page><page sequence="18">Re-Spiriting Hegel 53 some kind of end is presupposed. But to assume an end is in turn to presuppose a distinction between origin and end. Even the event of the supersession of such a distinction (between origin and end conceived as time) converts the end of history into the site of a general ontological transformation: from the temporal (historically or logically conceived) to the eternal (religiously or speculatively imagined) a nongeometric transformation is posited. In other words, the ques tion of passage relates to the problem of how one relates the passage of his tory?and thus of the historicity of history's temporal shapes (ancient cycles, Christian eschaton, modern endless duration)?to absolute knowing and the passage of time to eternity. The question of passage becomes the problem of how to relate two forms of passage, and these forms are prior to any thematic orientation, which assumes an origin/end scheme or an originless/endless dura tion (i.e., the cosmological antinomies). All we have is the relation between the passage of history to absolute knowing and the passage of the temporal to the eternal. This amounts to saying that we discover an interrelational passage prior to the singularization of its four terms: history, absolute knowing, the temporal, and the eternal. In reoccupying the possibility of a self-transcending form of speculation, we must suspend any imaginable correlation between the four terms, the end of history as the passage of the temporal to the eternal. In this manner, we can entertain for a moment the most obscure possibility of Hegel's dialectic: its self-supersession and the birth of an original form of movement beyond the antinomies of origin/end (time), originless/endless (eternity). As religious and metaphysical as Hegel's finale seems, namely, the passage from the temporally finite to the eternally infinite, something else appears in place of God. In continuing with Hyppolite, we can infer a peculiar state of speculative being: in the event of absolute knowing, one cannot merely assume the nature of oppositions, such as the temporal and the eternal, and then assign particular attributes to either side of the opposition (e.g., the temporally finite and the eternally infinite). Our quadrilateral event of history, absolute knowing, time, and eternity does not presuppose particular predicates, such as time as finite and eternity as infinite, or vice versa.18 To remind ourselves and our time, Hegel's hypostatization of the dialectic began as a critique of dogmatic meta physics; speculative philosophy tries to show that reflective philosophy requires subject-predicate relations; thereby, reflective philosophy always confronts the impossibility of surmounting oppositions, such as the finite and the infinite.19 If we have a correlation between the passage of history to absolute knowing and the passage of time to eternity, and if the substance of the correlation cannot be given in terms of naturalized oppositions and their quantized predicates (time as finite, for example), then we really do not have anything like substance, that is, an unchanging mode of the distinction between time (succession) and eternity (simultaneity), namely, God. Instead, Hyppolite says that history is self-creat ing. But unlike the Logos, which also creates (an eternal concept), the peculiar abiding creation?that is history?is temporal. We can imagine the self-cre</page><page sequence="19">54 RAJESH SAMPATH ation of a (contingent) free-occurrence, or the self-creation of history, and a (necessary) event, or the creation of the Logos, as a two-sided beast: the tempo ral and the eternal.20 Creation happens as time and eternity; or creation is a two sided event, of which one side is temporal and the other eternal. But the two sidedness is in itself neither temporal nor eternal: creation is not from one or the other, or one from the other, or from one to the other. We can imagine this two sidedness in terms of the simultaneity of its faces (time/eternity) or the successivity. But if we would do that, we would slop back into the dross of substance (simultaneity vs. succession), which is the transcendental condition of any idea in the Logos and thus the history of metaphysics. Spirit's notion will not appear as long as 'spirit' appears in time. This is precisely what is being superseded, namely, substance itself.21 To face the two-headed beast, which is the self-creation of history as tempo ral in relation to and distinct from the creation of the Logos as eternal, we open up a kind of singularity. The occurrence of this singularity has its own form. The imageless form subsumes time and eternity, but is neither; rather, the occur rence splits apart releasing the possibility of the opposition of time and eternity. And this splitting apart in its own primordial event does not presuppose an ori gin and end, eternity before time or time before eternity; it does not happen as succession or simultaneity. We do not walk among the land of essences, dead or alive. When considering the Logos as 'absolute genesis', Hyppolite considers a reciprocal determination, a mutual constitution of "being as sense and sense as being." The reciprocity itself constitutes the singularity of the event (absolute knowing). Since this is neither time (the historicity of history's shapes, circular, eschatological, endless progress) nor the eternity of a particular predicate form, which is oblivious to its negated opposition (metaphysical concept, substance, faith, infinite), Hyppolite speaks of a reversal. Within the metaphysical notion of history, one is within time, and thus mediation is the image of time passing, namely, the coming to be and passing away of different shapes and their opposi tions; the latter is the unactualized history of objective spirit's forms (ancients to German idealism). But with the event of absolute knowing, "time is the im age of mediation"; time, which takes no metaphysical image (circle, line, in stant, duration), is the image of the partitioning event, a separation, which gives birth to a new difference between succession (metaphysical time) and eternity (simultaneity). As an event of mediation, which is irreducible and singular, an event prior to the arising of the invisible difference between opposites (such as time and eternity), it includes an encounter with the immediacy of a certain Dasein. But this immediacy is not present, for present is opposed to absent and as such can be only a result or product of the event that produces difference (the nature of opposition). Instead, the immediacy is replaced by a kind of move ment, "an internal movement of determinations." The phrase "time is the con cept" does not mean that time is given as a concept (eternally divined); then again, it does not mean that the concept as time is determined by one or all of history's shapes (cycles, eschaton, endless duration). If it is neither part of an</page><page sequence="20">Re-Spiriting Hegel 55 ahistorical realm nor historical in any ordinary sense, it also refuses "the step not beyond," which itself is the infinite refusal of deciding on finitude and thus time itself. As free, the time as concept creates itself; it gives itself its form movement beyond history down here, eternity up there, and the purgatory of the neither/nor, or the mausoleum of the deconstructive aporia. Transcendence is transformation, not transformation from history to another realm, but transfor mation from the idea of the distinction between self (historical finitude) and Other (substance, God) to the event, which gives birth to a quadruplicitous dif ference. The ecstatic self-determination of time's own concept free from any other metaphysical determination or nonmetaphysical indetermination (differance) bares a relation to the event of absolute knowing. Furthermore, it is not essentially immobile; it reckons its time by inventing its own relation of birth and death. It is this relation (movement) to which we must return: Infinity is the pure nullification of the antithesis or of finitude; but it is at the same time also the spring of eternal movement, the spring of that finitude which is infinite, because it eternally nullifies itself. Out of this nothing and pure night of infinity, as out of the secret abyss that is its birthplace, the truth lifts itself upward. (Hegel 1977, 190) I'll conclude with a quote from Derrida's Of Spirit: Heidegger and the Question: One of the paths . . . would lead back to the spirituality of a promise which, without being opposed to Christianity, would be foreign to it, and even at the origin of Christianity (to which we can give several names), still more radi cally foreign to Platonic metaphysics and all that follows from it, foreign to a certain European determination of the course from East to West. What is most matutinal in the Fruhe, in its best promise, would in truth be of an other birth and an other essence, origin-heterogeneous [heterogene a I'origine] to all tes taments, all the promises, all the events, all the laws and assignments which are our very memory. Origin-heterogeneous: this is to be understand at once, all at once, in three senses: (1) heterogeneous from the origin, originarily het erogeneous; (2) heterogeneous with respect to what is called the origin, other than the origin and irreducible to it; (3) heterogeneous and or insofar as at the origin, origin-heterogeneous because at the origin of the origin. Heterogeneous because it is and although it is at the origin. "Because" and "although" at the same time, that's the logical form of tension which makes all this thinking hum. . . . What is origin-heterogeneous would in that case be nothing other? but it's not nothing?than the origin of Christianity: the spirit of Christianity or the essence of Christianity. (1989)22 Yes, but to truly hum the origin-heterogeneous, there is no admission of three, "of an all at once," and an "at the same time." Hence the other birth, which, precisely, is "not nothing."</page><page sequence="21">56 RAJESH SAMPATH Notes 1. See Hyppolite's Introduction to Hegel's Philosophy of History (1997a), Logic and Exist ence (1997b), Studies in Marx and Hegel (1969), Figures de la Pensee Philosophique (1971), and Genesis and the Structure of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (1974). For more on Hyppolite's reading of Hegel and his place within the history of different paradigms of interpreting Hegel, see Ludwig's "Hegel's Conception of Absolute Knowing" (1989) and Clark's "J. Hyppolite" (1971). 2. The early Marx read 'absolute knowing' in his 1844 Manuscripts as a mystification of the problem of alienation and objectification and its untenable reduction of nature to the Logos; this is why, for Marx, Hegel's Phenomenology cannot explain the essence of history from its own stand point in time, whereas communism can. In Fear and Trembling (1939), Kierkegaard discusses "the monstrous paradox of faith," "the movement of infinity," "of repetition," "the teleological suspen sion of the ethical," "the strength of the absurd," "the particular as the absolute relation to the absolute," in short, an instant of eternal finitude, where no philosophy can go and no theology can sell: faith as decision had to have an origin, and, as such, the origin exceeds what philosophy considers universal time or timeless eternity. Nietzsche does not challenge Hegel on the problem of time and historicity as directly as he does other figures, such as Schopenhauer. If anything, Nietzsche attacks the epigones, like David Friedrich Strauss, in his First Untimely Meditation', and in the Dawn, Nietzsche criticizes Hegel's style of presenting philosophy. His Genealogy of Morals is, of course, one of the greatest critiques of teleology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of history in gen eral ever penned. Division 2 of Heidegger's Being and Time alludes to the possible resemblance of Hegel's Phenomenology and Heidegger's ontological problem of Dasein's historizing temporalization (Geschehen) and the understanding of historizing, or historicality (Geschichtlichkeit); but Being and Time finally resigns itself to a critique of Hegel's notion of time as expressed in the Encyclopaedia (The Philosophy of Nature) and not the Phenomenology. If anything, time in the Phenomenology receives a very cursory and reductive treatment in Being and Time; it is not until his 1930-31 lecture course that Heidegger resumes a full-blown study of the Phenomenology; there, a sharp contrast is generated between the two thinkers. Following Heidegger, Gadamer argues in Truth and Method that his herrneneutical ontology recognizes the undeniable legacy of Hegel on historicity, but radically differs in its approach. In his Negative Dialectics, Adorno says that Hegel's system detemporalizes itself right when it tries to make time into absolute concept, which annuls time as substance. And following in the wake of certain historical methods born in the twentieth century (the Annales and the history of science), Foucault's The Archaeology of Knowledge is a general statement on the critique of linear models of history and its triumvirate priority of "continuity, teleology, and totality." We could provide numerous other examples of nineteenth- and twentieth-century philosophies of history that have attempted critiques, elaborations, sublimations, transformations, negations, recuperations of Hegel, yet failed to deal with, decide on, respond to, and ultimately replace 'absolute knowing': some of the figures include Althusser, Benjamin, Blanchot, Feurbach, Habermas, Haym, Kojeve, Korsch, Lask, Lefebvre, Levinas, Lukacs, Merleau-Ponty, Rickert, Ricoeur, Sartre, Simmel, and Trendelenberg, to name a few. For an excellent introduction to the history of readings of the Phenom enology, see "The Phenomenology of Spirit" Reader (Stewart 1998). Stewart's introductory essay gives us the historiography of the reading of the Phenomenology. The volume as a whole concludes with an exhaustive bibliography on general works on the Phenomenology, general works on the contextualization of the Phenomenology, and general and specific research on particular areas within the Phenomenology. 3. Hyppolite challenges some of the dominant assumptions for explaining the obscurity of the conclusion, such as Hegel's "hasty" completion of the chapter given the publication circumstances surrounding the Phenomenology (1807); the paradox of the preface being written after the work, or at least in relation to the conclusion, a relation that constitutes a complex field of resemblances; and Hegel's preoccupation with announcing his second work (Science of Logic) within the conclu sion of the Phenomenology?the two works that are supposed to constitute the first two parts of the "System" (see Hyppolite 1974, 574). For a good discussion on the empirical structure and organi zation of the Phenomenology, which includes a brief historiography of Hegel scholarship (Haering, Haym, and Poggler), see Pippin's "You Can't Get There from Here" (1993). For work on the context of the genesis and completion of the Phenomenology in relation to the system, see chapter</page><page sequence="22">Re-Spiriting Hegel 57 4 of Solomon's In the Spirit of Hegel (1983), Fulda's Das Problem einer Einleitung im Hegels Wissenschaft der Logik (1965), Brockard's Subjekt, Versuch zur Ontologie bei Hegel (1970), Fulda and Henrich's Materialen zu Hegel's "Phdnomenologie des Geistes" (1973), and Rockmore's On Hegel's Epistemology and Contemporary Philosophy (1996, 57). My speculative hypothesis is that 'absolute knowing' is difficult because it poses the problem of culminating the history of meta physics in the West by way of a metaphysical conception of history: a concept beyond the time vs. eternity distinction. The passage and the transformation temporalizes an event, which supersedes the time/eternity distinction; or, rather, 'absolute knowing' considers the self-given event of pas sage beyond all previous spiritual forms (metaphysics, religion, empirical science). The temporalization of the event has yet to offer itself its own form. 4. In his 1931-33 lecture on the Phenomenology of Spirit, Heidegger raises the problem of situating Hegel's corpus. He, too, asks how it constitutes a 'system' (1994). 5. Hyppolite is not the only commentator who has recognized the perplexity of 'absolute knowing' in ways that challenge contemporary and past assumptions. Foucault, Heidegger, Nietzsche, and Marx dismiss Hegel and his phenomenological problem of time, movement, eschatology (end), history, in short, the problem of the passage from the dialectic to the 'absolute idea'. Herbert Marcuse's early text, Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity (1932), is a direct response to Husserl's phenomenology and Heidegger's ontology (he studied with Heidegger from 1927 to 1932). Marcuse's work is a brilliant exposition of the problem of movement, or Bewegtheit, "motility," which is distinct from motion or movement: movement is simply the mea sure of a change in location. Motility takes us back to the problem of an Aristotelian metaphysics concerning the essence of movement itself. From Marcuse's work to Anglo-American scholarship on Hegel over the last three decades, one can find fairly substantial treatments of Hegel's Phenom enology, and particularly its philosophy of history. The work of G. K. Armstrong, D. Berthold Bond, S. Crites, J. C. Flay, M. Gillispie, Q. Lauer, C. Page, R. Pippin, S. Rosen, D. Schmidt, J. Toews, D. P. Verene, M. Westphal, A. White, and B. T. Wilkins should be mentioned. 6. In terms of the history of specific philosophical shapes, it is from the pre-Socratics (Heraclitus and Parmenides) to "the pure 'thought thinking itself of Aristotle, the forming or form-creating divine intellect of Christian Neo-Platonism, the self-caused god or substance of Spinoza, the transformation of Kant's synthetic unity of apperception into the Absolute Ego of Fichte and Schelling" (Rosen 1974, xviii). Also see Flay's "The History of Philosophy and the Phenomenology of Spirit" (1975). 7. Levinas raises a similar question concerning absolute knowing, but ultimately he resigns himself to the critique of the possibility of how spirit could be conscious of this dual problematic; therefore, Levinas, too, comes on the side of the impossibility of deciding on the problem of final ity and eschatology in Hegel. Furthermore, he goes on to thematize this impossibility in terms of certain quasi-theological registers, such as "patience," "de-ference," and the "prophetic event" (1987, 135-38). 8. In the last section before "Absolute Knowing," the last moment of spirit's shape before the passage, namely, "Revealed Religion," Hegel makes this point. Spirit, conscious of itself as 'abso lute', loses itself when reduced to the status of a predicate or an empty, abstract form (1979, 453). For an analysis of Hegel's critique of the 'absolute form' in religion, see Jamros's The Human Shape of God (1994), Fackenheim's The Religious Dimension in Hegel's Thought (1967', 51), Olson's Hegel and the Spirit (1992), and Burbidge's Hegel on Logic and Religion (1992). A general anthol ogy on Hegel and the philosophy of religion is New Perspectives on Hegel's Philosophy of Reli gion (Kolb 1992). We must note that in an extended footnote in the second edition of the Encyclo pedia (1826), Hegel tries to distinguish his dialectical-speculative logic from these forms: "pan theism, or the identity of God and the world (evil); atheism, which falsely absolutizes the finite; theism, which personifies the absolute negatively rather than contemplating the ground of the ab solute; dualism, or the irrecoverable and insuterable split between creator and created; akosmism, where God is everything and the world is illusion; traditionalism, or the subjugation of man to scripture and the authority of revelation" (1959, 285). Absolute knowing would have to sublate all onto-theologies, of which Christianity is the primary expression for Hegel. 9. Think of scientists today enraptured by black holes, the "big bang theory," or the "big crunch." It is easy to deconstruct their complex images insofar as the scientific community does</page><page sequence="23">58 RAJESH SAMPATH not even recognize the problem of transcendence and the essential insolubility of Kant's cosmo logical antinomies. 10. How my argument affects the classic treatments of possibility and impossibility in the his tory of philosophy remains to be seen. Aristotle's trenchant distinction between impossible and possible seems indestructible: a proposition is impossible if the converse of the proposition is by necessity true (diagonal of a square is commensurate with a side); a proposition is possible if the converse of the proposition is not by necessity false (a man is sitting) (Metaphysics). We also have Heidegger's explicit attempt to tie the problem of impossibility to the ontological (nonmetaphysical and nontheological) question of death: death is "the possibility of the pure and simple impossibil ity for Dasein" (1962, 250). Things are further complicated by French phenomenology and Freud ianism in the works of Derrida himself. See, in particular, Aporia (1993). My goal, however, is not to meander around with the logical (syllogistic), phenomenological, genealogical-ethical (deconstructive) analysis of the possibilities and impossibilities of the distinction between possi bility and impossibility. My main question concerns the relation between time, movement, the historicity of history, and the question of epochal thresholds. This is not say that I do not presup pose the enormous heritage of Western thought (Plato to Derrida). 11. One merely has to look at Derrida's latest works in the 1990s, which have turned to reflec tions on religion, witnessing, secrets, responsibility, faith, gift, attestation. Given a strange mixture of Christianity and his own covert Judaic background, one must consider not only the workings of a negative theology in the heart of his transcendental assumptions, but also the surfacing of ex plicit religious and theological themes in his latest writings. See, for example, "Sauf le nom" (1995). For more on deconstruction and negative theology, see Derrida and Negative Theology (Coward and Foshay 1992) and Caputo's The Prayers and Fears of Jacques Derrida (1997). This is not to say that religion, particularly Christianity and Judaism, did not play major roles in his earlier works; from the Introduction to Husserl's Origin of Geometry (1961) to Of Grammatology (1967) to Margins of Philosophy (1972) to Glas (1974), I would argue, the confrontation with religion and the philosophy of history was in full effect. 12. For a good critical and philosophical analysis of 'absolute knowing' and the 'absolute idea', see Ludwig's "Hegel's Conception of Absolute Knowing" (1989). Also consult major works on Hegel, such as those of J. N. Findley, Q. Lauer, T. Pinkard, R. Pippin, S. Rosen, R. Solomon, C. Taylor, and M. Westphal, as well as minor contributions based on specific themes, such as the works of M. Aboulafia, D. Berthold-Bond, J. Burbidge, S. Crites, A. Olson, and D. P. Verene. 13. Rosen, for instance, follows up on this critique?namely, that one cannot simply extract a philosophy of history from the Phenomenology (see 1974, xix). 14. A good essay on history and historicism in Hegel's philosophy is Beiser's "Hegel's Histori cism" (1993). Beiser argues that one must look beyond Hegel's explicit discussions on history, such as The Lectures on the Philosophy of World History, The Lectures on the History of Philoso phy, and The Philosophy of Right. The reflection on history and the structure of a historicist con sciousness both function in the major 'system', which includes The Science of Logic and the Ency clopedia. For work on the problem of history and historicity in Hegel's Phenomenology and Logic, consult the following standard works: Rosen's G.W.F. Hegel (1974, 29-45), Wilkins's Hegel's Philosophy of History (1974), Westphal's History and Truth in Hegel's Phenomenology (1979), Berthold-Bond's Hegel's Grand Synthesis (1989), and Harris's The Spirit of Hegel (1993). Also see the excellent collection History and System (Perkin 1984) and, within that volume, the infor mative essays of Walsh, "The Historical Dialectic of Spirit"; Jaeschke, "World History and the History of the Absolute Spirit"; and Ahlers, "The Dialectic in Hegel's Philosophy of History." All of these consider (briefly) speculative and ontological dimensions of the philosophy of history in Hegel's Jensner system, the Phenomenology and the 'system' and not just the more typical the matic orientations from the Philosophy of Right to the lectures on the Philosophy of World His tory. However, we must note that none of these raise the issue of an entirely new speculative ontology of movement, time, and being. Ultimately, they return either to the later writings on politics, the state, freedom, and intersubjectivity or to Hegel's philosophy of religion from the Jungenschriften to the Phenomenology. We, however, seek a direct and unremitting confrontation with 'absolute knowing' and the 'absolute idea' on the restricted issues of time, death, movement, and the historicity of history.</page><page sequence="24">Re-Spiriting Hegel 59 15. Again, from Marx's 1844 Manuscripts to the appraisals of Hegel by Haym, Trendelenberg, Kierkegaard, Simmel, the neo-Kantians, and historicism to Heidegger, Lukacs, Benjamin, Althusser and everyone under their shadow in the twentieth century, the problem of time, movement, event, epochal transformation, and the historicity of history in the Phenomenology has not been reckoned with in a deeply sustained and elaborate ontological way; if it has been acknowledged (as in the last chapter of Heidegger's Sein und Zeit), it has not been surpassed, let alone replaced with an other construction of time, movement, event, transformation, and the historicity of history. This is true as well for the complex history of twentieth-century Hegelianism from Kojeve to Anglo American Hegelian scholars. In making this strong statement, I am not suggesting that the great figures in European thought over the last two centuries have failed to treat Hegel; on the contrary, from Marx to Derrida, there is a complex history of treating different aspects and themes in Hegel/ Hegelianism, themes such as alienation (Entaussurung) or Hegel's semiology. Heidegger and Kojeve, for example, have tried to deal with time and history in Hegel's Phenomenology, but admit to insur mountable limits and difficulties. Our focus, however, is singular: the temporalization of epochal transformation based on the self-conceptual event of an entirely different kind of "movement." In deed, none of the above-mentioned figures considered a different metaphysical conception of move ment. The early Marcuse (Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity) may be an exception, but even he does not come up with an entirely new and distinct idea of movement (motility). 16. From traditional Anglo-American work on Hegel, such as Hegel: A Collection of Critical Essays (Maclntyre 1972), to contemporary deconstructive interpretations, such as that of Jean-Luc Nancy, the question of philosophy's relation to history in Hegel is staged in many different ways. 17. It is interesting to note that in the tradition of the West, there are several philosophical attempts that try to break the reign of trinity in thought (religious or dialectical) by introducing a four-dimensional configuration. The ninth-century a.d. Irish monk John the Scott, was among the first to translate Aristotle from the original Greek into Latin. As an early Christian theologian, however, he ventured his own metaphysical cosmology consisting of four possibilities: the creator which is not created, the created which cannot create, that which creates and is created, and that which cannot create and is not created (see his De Divisione Naturae, bk. 1). And in modern metaphysics, Alfred North Whitehead's Process and Reality (1929) proffers the possibility of a chiasmic form, which threatens the dialectical trinity. See, for instance, "God and the World" in Process and Reality. Finally, the late Heidegger's obscure reflections in essays such as "Building Dwelling Thinking" (1954) and "The Thing" (1950) introduce the enigmatic "four-fold": the "mir ror-play" of divinities, mortals, earth, and sky in "one-fold" fourness of mutual expropriation appropriation. As fascinating as these resources are, none of them offer a positively distinct and affirmative form, which replaces the "three-moment" dialectic on the basis of different logical conditions. This, indeed, is the legacy of the Christian European West. Furthermore, the problem of time, movement, and the historicity of history is not recognized in terms of the problem of epochal thresholds. We are not trying to solve the enigma of the absolute or negate its possibility. 18. To reiterate, we are not assuming that the passage from history to absolute knowing in relation to the passage of time to eternity takes the form of an end of history or an endless continu ation for that matter. These are part of the metaphysical forms of history (particularly, the Christian version and philosophies of progress). And, to recall, we are considering the singularity of the event of absolute knowing and not a particular epochal shape of time and history. 19. In addition to the preface of the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807), one can mention Hegel's first sustained philosophical contributions, The Difference between Fichte and Schelling's System of Philosophy (1801) and Faith and Knowledge (1803). In the latter two, one finds a germinal statement of a specific Hegelian method, which criticizes pretranscendental dogmatic metaphysics (Descartes and Leibniz), empiricism (Locke and Hume), and the evolution of German idealism (Kant to Schelling). 20. The enigma of this two-sidedness appears in the very last two pages of "Absolute Know ing," toward the very end of the Phenomenology of Spirit (1979,492-93). For a good critical essay that includes an analysis of the irreducible relation between time and eternity in Hegel, see Flay's "The Essence of Time in Hegel" (1989). Flay challenges traditional interpretative attempts that try to unify time and eternity in absolute knowing, but posit asymmetrically a foundation to the unity; the latter recapitulates unwittingly some form of either side of the divide, namely, time or eternity.</page><page sequence="25">60 RAJESH SAMPATH 21. Again in the Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel ventures a critique of substance; in fact, he speculates about a double transmutation of self into substance and substance into self, that is, the self of 'spirit' and not the history of the subject (Cartesian, Kantian, Fichtean, etc.) (1979, 486-87). Neither self as substance nor substance as self can be reduced to "picture-thinking." Furthermore, it does not admit to any opposition and thus a subject-predicate relation. It has its own movement and interrelated form: the form of a double transmutation in the self-conceptual event of becoming. 22. And in Derrida's encounter with Hegel, Christianity, and Judaism in his fantastic Glas, he asks: "What is the function of the Christian model? In what sense is it exemplary (in Hegel) for speculative onto-theology? Can this model be circumscribed and displaced as a finite and particu lar structure, bound to given historical conditions? Can a history different from the one represented here be interrogated? Can the horizon be changed? the logic?" (1986, 33). Works Cited Ahlers, Rolf. 1984.
