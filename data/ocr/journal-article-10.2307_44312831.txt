<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity and Literature Vol. 50, No. 2 (Winter 2001 ) The Perfection of Roo Borson Nick Giese The Canadian poet Roo Borson represents a contemporary tradition of verse writing and verse philosophy that can be examined in the work of many recent poets. Her perfection lies precisely in the skill with which she expresses thoughts that bring to fulfillment the ideas of much recent verse and that constitute an extension, if not a culmination, of a line of reasoning that be- gins in several of the more prominent modernist writers of our century. One might have looked in Poetry's recent issues for the same bittersweet panegy- ric on the beauty and transience of the earth, the same conviction of the fi- nality of that "wide water, without sound" (Stevens 67). Certainly Borson's latest valedictory verse goes beyond anything that Wallace Stevens wrote in "Sunday Morning" or "Esthetique du Mal." Her work still opens into the poignant moment of perception, the contentment "when wakened birds, / before they fly, test the reality of misty fields" (Stevens 68). Borson shares that gift of vision with Stevens. What has altered, however, can be seen in the change from the aesthetic of Stevens' "Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction" to the implicit aesthetic of Borson. "The major abstraction," Stevens writes, "is the idea of man." Later he says, "It is of him, ephebe, to make, to confect . . . plainly to propound" (388-89). Verse must be abstract while changing and giving pleasure, but the ultimate abstraction to be propounded is human. The extrapolation of this aesthetic, however, has been to displace the human with a new Romantic fo- cus on nature, so that not only is divinity rejected, as in "Sunday Morning" and elsewhere, but humanity as well. What remains is aesthetic awareness of nature, beautifully constructed. Beyond that, and here she follows Rob- inson Jeffers, Borson creates an aesthetic in which the burden of human consciousness is also discarded, so that her verse values not the human ex- perience of nature as an alternative to faith but rather the animal conscious- ness of nature as the preferred alternative to human consciousness. Still further, she often contemplates the absence of consciousness of any kind as a goal. Stevens strove to find the thing itself beyond all imaginings; Borson finds a possibility of consciousness without human reflection. What might 293</page><page sequence="2">294 Nick Giese be called a poetry of animal consciousness thus becomes a goal: to reduce human desire, the human need for explanation, to the point that a refined and passive reception of the felt world becomes the ultimate aesthetic and lived experience. Put another way, the poet invites the reader to engage with her in a process of receiving the world without any exercise of will, choice, or interpretation. Is this a kind of Eastern spirituality, a conquest of all desire as well as of all desire to interpret? Is this the peace that surpasses understanding? Does Borson in fact reach for the act of perception as it might have been in Eden, before the knowledge of good and evil complicated our relation to nature? Or is the peace she offers one that falls short of understanding? Is it a peace that one reaches by subduing the will to know and by lifting up sensation unburdened by thought? There is a genuine sense in which the wonder of this hedonistic poetry - its call to go beyond what Stevens advocated, its valorization of animal understanding - becomes the literary equivalent of the environmentalist Earth First movement, whose extension of green logic leads to the choice of killing men to save trees. First erase the divine; then erase the human. Finally, erase even animal experience and participate in nature directly, as the rest of the cosmos experiences it, whatever that might mean. What follows is intended to be both an encomium of Borson's poetic skill and a rejection of the negative spirituality she embraces so passionately and forcefully, a negative spirituality that becomes a playful dance around a black hole. By the words "negative spirituality" I do not mean to invoke the apo- phatic tradition; rather, I mean to point to the use of language in a way that suggests spirituality while making statements that are either nihilistic or with- out meaning. Borson's poetry raises for religious readers, and specifically for Christian readers, a real and unavoidable dilemma. Do we merely "ap- preciate" work that is deeply hedonistic and atheistic? Do we do any kind of justice to poetry like Borson s by praising its literary value without tak- ing its ideas seriously? Do we focus on the literary values alone without engaging the attack on our foundational values? Do we instead transmute the work as we read it, savoring and even recommending its somewhat East- ern "spirituality" while politely failing to notice that this spirituality is deeply antagonistic to other values we hold? Put another way, what distinctions should be drawn between the kind of personal emptying pictured by Bor- sons texts and the emptying described in The Cloud of Unknowing ? Is the work of the critic always to praise art because it is art? As W. H. Auden re- marked in one version of his elegy on William Butler Yeats, is it true that "Time" (or God) "Worships language and forgives / Everyone by whom it lives" ( Collected Poetry 50)? Borson raises these and many other questions, and it is better to face them squarely than to sidestep them by such maneu-</page><page sequence="3">Roo Borson's Poetry 295 vers as praising her as a spiritual poet because she is deeply engaged with matters of "ultimate concern." By raising these questions I merely update an argument made by Yvor Winters in his study of Hart Crane. "There is something supernatural about poetry," Winters wrote, "in a simple, literal and theological sense": In poetry, one mind acts directly upon another Furthermore, the action is not only an action by way of idea, but by way of emotion and moral atti- tude; it is both complex and elusive. Poetry is a medium by means of which one mind may to a greater or lesser extent take possession of another. (In Defense 600) Winters raised his concerns about the way that the tradition running from Ralph Waldo Emerson through Walt Whitman and Crane seemed to equate sheer impulse with wisdom or divine inspiration. Rather than flatly con- demning the work of Crane, however, Winters offered both a sincere appre- ciation of Crane's poetic gifts and an equally direct condemnation of his ideas. Borson represents another step in that same Romantic and nihilistic "tradition" of Winters. Like Crane, Borson is a gifted poet whose work de- serves not so much a balanced appreciation as a mixed judgment, because she seductively presents ideas that from a Christian perspective are arguably false and misleading. She is also sufficiently representative of her time that an examination of her gifts and ideas can serve as a caution in reading sim- ilar work. Christian readers and critics need to pay particular attention to the lines that mark the border between pluralistic spirituality and orthodoxy, because there is much beautiful and vaguely spiritual poetry being written that does not lead toward a confrontation with that particular historical and incarnational tradition that is the Christian faith. Another important point made in Winter's essay on Crane has a bearing on the reading of Borson's work. The Romantic embrace of nature and impulse produced many wonderful metaphorical explorations of different ways of experiencing the world and consciousness. Christopher Smart's description of his cat's religious devotions, for example, offers an insight into his own humility, but do we have access to what a cat feels and knows? What happens when we allow ourselves to accept metaphors as truths? Borson raises this issue repeatedly when she seems to prefer animal consciousness to human experience, as when she suggests in her poem "Spring" that new- born lambs innately understand the world better than humans ever will (Night Walk 31). Winters is right to require that poets' ideas make factual and moral sense. The perfection of Borson lies in her beautiful language, particularly her use of long vowel tones, that accomplishes something like the nihilistic ob-</page><page sequence="4">296 Nick Giese jectives of Laura Riding's poems. Whereas Riding adopts a rough and abrupt language like that of Gertrude Stein's "Four Saints in Three Acts," Borson is sinuous and lyrical. Consider the opening stanza of Riding's "As Many Questions as Answers": What is to start? It is to have feet to start with. What is to end? It is to have nothing to start again with, And not to wish. (34) Like Stein, Riding works at a linguistic level, challenging the meaning and use of words themselves in order to reach a different kind of meaning or perhaps deny meaning to language altogether. Borson repeatedly reaches the same state of emptiness, the same state of being all poured out like an emp- ty vessel, but she achieves her end by leading us to apprehend her viewpoint through the direct experience of landscapes and feelings. It is this skill at playing the game of emptiness that constitutes her perfection, as in the end of "County Road": On the foggy road alone, No sound of another car anywhere, Only the muffled city somewhere, Fifty thousand miles away, fifty thousand miles. (Whole Night 31) Borson's genius lies precisely in her ability to drive her peculiar quest to its ultimate end, an end in which the human disappears altogether and in which we experience this reduction without wistfulness or sentimentality but rather as beauty and truth. In this craft Borson is like her contemporary, the French-American sculptor Sara Holt, whose largest installation, three mono- liths some forty feet high at a crossroads in central France, consists of enor- mous concrete posts that are imagined to be pointing toward the planet Earth from the constellation Sirius. From the perspective of Sirius, the Earth is too small to show at all on the scale of the sculpture; Earth is to be grasped by the viewer as something insignificant that lies approximately at the junction of the three lines defined by Sirius' stars. Holt's message is that this planet of ours is a speck of less than nothing. In a similar way Borson reduces humankind to sensuous animals. Occasionally she goes further and brings the human pageant to an icy end in which there is no meaning at all beyond the movement of physical bodies according to natural laws. "Moon," quot- ed here in full, shows her at her reductive best.</page><page sequence="5">Roo Borson's Poetry 297 Swathed in a nautilus-curve of cloud, the full moon seeks out every place. It smells like ice. Compared with it the earthly trees reek of patchouli. The limbs of lovers, their eyes of haunted oil flicker in the light, the earth a vast hearth. Such secretive things out there: asteroids hurtle like bricks. Each creature a clock, ticking out a certain measure of life. They look at you with their doleful eyes, and you look back. Tonight the wind isn't wind but a chorus of transparent masks. You can't see them, you merely believe. History is beginning to demand an end to the story. A meteor slides by: nowhere you have ever been. ( Night Walk 19) Here Borson describes the sadness of the human condition, the emptiness of our mythologies, the pointlessness of history as "story," and a universe in which even the place we are is part of the nowhere we have ever been. Her ability to describe these feelings so starkly and simply is admirable, as are her poems about her sense of loss now that her parents are no more. Borson s later verse, as in the collection Water Memory (1996), has more recollections of family life. She becomes wittier, affirms that love makes us human, and stresses the importance of current relationships as well as of childhood memories. Her stronger verses, tighter in logic and language, are the earlier poems in which she lives out on the absolute edge and confronts the void, though her work both early and late often asserts an equivalence between either animal consciousness or sheer emptiness and the deepest human experience. Once the human subject is gone - even if that achievement is sustainable only for short poems, as Stevens found it difficult to sustain any encounter with the veritable thing in itself - poetry comes to have a curiously limited range. The ethical, insofar as ethical choice is a human phenomenon, is no longer a subject. Neither is interpersonal experience, except perhaps as one might remember abstracted feelings from a past life before the erasure of the human, or to the extent that one might express fellow animal feeling, whether with a rat or with hominem rationis capax. "Still lives," or moments captured in memory from the past, might be appropriate subjects for pictorial verse, though pictures of nature imbued with feelings of sheer presence would dominate. This is Borson's richest territory. Born and raised in Berkeley, California, where she lived through the 1950s</page><page sequence="6">298 Nick Giese and 60s, Borson moved to Canada in the early 70s, where she has become a significant voice among contemporary Canadian poets. In her 1981 collec- tion A Sad Device the title poem refers to the human heart, an inadequate organ of feeling that offers less to us than our atavistic awareness of our commonality with animals past and present. At the close of the poem, Bor- son identifies with a rat she has seen, whose "eyes like glycerin" reveal noth- ing. Her language describing the rat, however, strangely echoes the language in which Stevens described Crispin. We have not Crispin's "eye most apt in gelatines and jupes," seeking to grasp this "inscrutable world" (27), but rather a gelatinous eye - a "siphon of smells / mortician gathering in the gauzy corpses," a rat who "construes the world" (42). Borson's poetic strategy is first to dwarf the human, as Crispin was dwarfed by nature, with a reflection on interstellar space such as the one already quoted above. Another poem on the moon makes a similar state- ment about the elimination of humanity. She gives us not T. S. Elioťs ob- servation on London Bridge, "I had not thought death had undone so many," but rather "At rush hour / There are a billion people walking away forever. / They come at me / with the face of a herd / bound for extinction" (50). Her second strategy, as these passages show, is always to assert the animality of the human. A man dead on a floor is "like an animal in the road" (41), and in a last note on history that closes the volume she writes: This century no longer a darkness We're moving into, But a forest of animals with human eyes, And you among them, I among them too. (62) Earlier in the century Wilfred Owen asked, "What passing bells for those who die as cattle?" Borson's answer seems to ask for simple acceptance that we are indeed cattle and that we are likely to experience more of the inde- scribable beauty of this earth if we take it into our senses as directly and with as little mediation of consciousness as possible. This is as far as one can get from the understanding of nature and the infusion of meaning in the natu- ral order that one finds, for example, at the end of Auden's "Horae Canon- icae," where on the morning after the Crucifixion the animals awake and peer about, and it is clear that the whole Creation has grasped something of the miracle that has taken place: "Among the leaves the small birds sing; / The crow of the cock commands awaking: / In solitude, for company" ( Collected Poems 485) . The contrast is still clearer in Borson's "Spring," where she imag- ines a newborn lamb unfolding its legs and taking off for a run. Borson writes that people never fully understand what it means to be in the world,</page><page sequence="7">Roo Borson's Poetry 299 but lambs "get it" immediately. Whereas the animals in Audens poem are by grace allowed to understand something that is deeply grasped by human persons, in Borsons reflection animals are superior to humans. Her 1984 collection titled The Whole Night, Coming Home carries this aesthetic into a meditation on her family's past and on relations with loved ones. Her family members appear for the most part as still photographs: a father asleep with a journal, a sister caught standing naked in the morning light. Poems dedicated to a former friend or lover reduce their experience to a single perception, such as the smell of eucalyptus leaves in the Berkeley hills. Her way of presenting that dusky and all-pervading smell, familiar to anyone who has lived along the California coast where eucalyptus was plant- ed in the late nineteenth century by railroad companies, places the reader on the point of a piercing ambiguity: Until you sent them I never put together their sweet, smoky smell with the hills that bore so much walking, it was just the way those years smelled. (66) The smell of the leaf embodies the whole relationship, whose entire matrix of human feeling seems reduced to that chemical odor and simplified almost to the point of annihilation. Borson conveys her point of view exquisitely. She dances on the sharp edge of extinction with an equipoise and acceptance that are refined and purified, though at the same time she does look back with affection on her youth and the experience of family. But that is the past, apparently. To the degree that her perfection is representative of a certain kind of nihilistic rea- soning and hedonistic poetic practice, it is worth asking about other stations along that road, and not only about her indebtedness to Stevens or other major modern poets but also about her possible indebtedness to poets of her home environment who stopped their progress short of the distance to which she has gone. It is difficult to read Borson's work without noting how it resembles yet rejects aspects of other Bay Area and California writers. She brings to mind the extremism of Jeffers, particularly his rejection of the human and his prizing of the animal, who wrote in "Hurt Hawks" that "I'd sooner, except the penalties, kill a man than a hawk" (431) and who lifted up his religious symbols of rock and hawk in a poem of that title: I think here is your emblem To hand in the future sky; Not the cross, not the hive.</page><page sequence="8">300 Nick Giese Mysticism of stone, Which failure cannot cast down. (433-34) Borson, however, does not commit Jeffers' anthropomorphic fallacy in which he sets up an alternative ethic, and an alternative set of symbols, that is charged with a selection of human values associated with strength, brutali- ty, and the capacity to survive. Her vision instead is one of the reduction of the human to the animal, with a corresponding rejection of any special hu- man gifts, not the elevation of the animal over the human as a model for us to emulate as in Jeffers. Borson resembles more closely the poet who inspired many of the Beat and later writers of the Bay Area, Kenneth Rexroth, especially in his use of the lore of the heavens and study of the sky as in "A Lesson in Geography": The stars of the Great Bear drift apart. There are rocks On the earth more durable Than the configurations of heaven. Species now motile and sanguine Shall see the stars in new clusters. (11) Rexroths meditations on poets, history, and family have a human dimen- sion, however, and a concern for the depths of relationships that seems to be absent in Borson's verse. Consider his poem about a hike in the Sierra Nevada with his daughter. Titled "The Great Nebula of Andromeda," the poem plays on a tension between the wheeling movement of the stars and Rexroth's fierce love for his child, over whom he watches as she sleeps un- der the stars: I lie on my elbow watching Your beautiful sleeping face Like a jewel in the moonlight. If you are lucky, and the Nations let you, you will live Far into the twenty-first Century. I pick up the glass And watch the Great Nebula Of Andromeda swim like A phosphorescent amoeba Slowly around the Pole. (85) The genealogy of this poem reaches back to Yeats's "A Prayer for My Daugh-</page><page sequence="9">Roo Borson's Poetry 301 ter" and even to Ben Jonsori s sonnet on his dead son, "Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy." Compared to expressions of those fierce loves, Borson s work conveys more acceptance and resignation. Both of these California poets, Borson and Rexroth, share something as well with another Bay Area writer who was touched by those landscapes of brown, silent hills, long ranges of mountains, and plains of grass that were once ancient seas. While Rexroth writes verse that refers directly to writers in the mystic tradition and seeks ways to blend his understanding of the land- scape with traditional Christianity, as in "Human, Avian, Vegetable Blood," his near-contemporary Winters is closer to Borson in working more by re- duction and negative statement than by affirmation. Still, there is a world of difference between what Winters and Borson find in that confrontation with emptiness, as is evident in Winters' "To the Holy Spirit," which states its basic ambiguity toward the divine in an enviable opening line: "Immea- surable haze" ( Collected Poems 138). Standing silently in a deserted grave- yard, he tries to connect the noon scene to the frightening image of God's "unfleshed eye" and the "spectral tree" ( Collected Poems 139). Are these re- minders of the ultimate silence of the sky? Do they bring to mind instead the cross and the dead body of Jesus? Or is the tree "spectral" and the eye "unfleshed" because they are part of a new and resurrected reality? Uncer- tain what he can conclude other than that we die, Winters ends on the thought that time fades into "irrelevance," but whether the irrelevance of utter annihilation or the irrelevance of history redeemed in a meaning that partakes of something else is not clear. The poem's only affirmations are its title and the depth of the meditative moment. If he describes a voyage to- ward something beyond him, Winters does not say; presence is defined by absence, by silence, by a noon vibrating with heat. While Borson's poems seem to say that the phenomenal is all, Winters' call to the Holy Spirit seems to hum, through that haze, with a throbbing intersection of the phenome- nal and the noumenal. One last Berkeley poet speaks to the difference between a poetry that defines faith negatively and one that takes the final step to rejecting any but animal sensation. Czesław Milosz's late poem "On Prayer" begins with a negation, "You ask me how to pray to someone who is not." Does Miłosz deny God, or does he point to the difficulty of defining the divine with such a category as "is"? The poem does not answer the question directly; Miłosz asserts, instead, that everyone will eventually be on the bridge of prayer, a bridge that begins here, and at any time, but that may have no concrete end. That bridge leads to the shore of Reversal Where everything is just the opposite and the word is Unveils a meaning we hardly envisioned.</page><page sequence="10">302 Nick Giese And ... if there is no other shore We will walk that aerial bridge all the same. (424) Many years earlier in "Veni Creator" Miłosz gave a different answer to the question of divine being. Struggling with his need to see a definite and per- sonal miracle, some evidence that would convince him, he turned instead in humility and made this request: But I understand that signs must be human, therefore call one man, anywhere on earth, not me - after all I have some decency - and allow me, when I look at him, to marvel at you. (194) The divine is only found in a human incarnation. Miłosz combines the ambiguity of the other poets with a stronger faith; he also understands the temptation to dehumanize the cosmos. We can recognize this difference in a poem that comes full circle on the topic of this essay, the perfection and also the poverty of a poetic that final- ly rejects the human. Speaking not to Borson but to JefFers, Miłosz wrote in 1963: The earth teaches More than does the nakedness of elements. Better to carve suns and moons on the joints of crosses as was done in my district. To birches and firs give feminine names. To implore protection against the mute and treacherous might than to proclaim, as you did, an inhuman thing. (225) Perhaps Miłosz refers here to Jeffers' "Roan Stallion" and its portrayal of bestiality; perhaps he refers to other animist elements in Jeffers' verse and personal history. Whatever the specific reference, his protest is against the devalorization of the human. To one degree or another, all of these poets participate in the Emersonian embrace of the natural as the good. None of them contemplates that darker view of nature found in some modern bio- logists who examine the cruelty inherent in natural behavior, the cruelty that Joris Karl Huysmans, to cite one instance, studied from an aesthetic point of view in A Rebours , particularly the eighth chapter of that novel where Des Esseintes brings into his home carnivorous tropical flowers that are so hor- rible, savage, and repugnant that they lead to his worst nightmares. This, as Stevens says in "Esthetique du Mal," is an element of the sublime from which</page><page sequence="11">Roo Borson's Poetry 303 we shrink and that plays little part in contemporary Romanticism. Stevens wrote in "The Comedian as the Letter C" that "the natives of the rain are rainy men" (37). We are, he suggests, creatures of our local climate, where our art takes its roots. Whether Borson found her artistic roots in the silence of the hills above Berkeley or in the areas of northern California that inspired Jeffers, Winters, Rexroth, and Miłosz is a moot point. Whether she learned from any of these poets does not particularly matter. Her verse re- sembles theirs in its intensity and in its deep engagement with what the nat- ural world seems to say. Her passionate nihilism and hedonism are both less sophisticated and starker than Stevens'. Comparison to an older generation of California poets merely suggests that behind the negations, behind the "No" of which Stevens so often wrote, others have found "reversal" and a human other. Borson's perfection lies in her ability to follow that same path a greater distance, to camp there at the end of conscious reflection, and to report on the life of direct perception. In The Cloud of Unknowing such a path is conditioned by worship, and that camping ground, if one reaches it, is a place to wait for the appearance of the divine. For Borson it seems to be enough to live there without any expectation. One might wish, as did Miguel de Unamuno his readers at the end of The Tragic Sense of Life, that God deny Borson peace in this too simple, too reductionist, a perfection and grant her, as Unamuno also said, a different kind of "victory" (330).
