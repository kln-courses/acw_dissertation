<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PREHISTORY OF BALUCHISTAN: SOME INTERPRETATIVE PROBLEMS JIM G . S HA FFER ABSTRACT Baluchistan prehistory is reviewed here in terms of recent (1960's and 1970's) archaeological investigations and various analytical models. Reports published over the past decade reveal increased interest in and information about auto- nomous and indigenous cultural development, trading and religious interaction spheres and other evidences of intersocietal interaction, and developments of Harappan civilizations ♦ The creation of longer cultural chronologies challenges diffusionary models stressing invasion or cata- strophe which heretofore have been popular in describing culture change. Newer analytical models stress ecological and interactive relation- ships between the basic adaptations of flood plain agriculture and inter- flood plain pastoralism. Such models may explain how cultural mechanisms provide security against scarcity in an environ- ment where scarcity is relatively frequent. INTRODUCTION Traditionally archaeology research in the Middle East has concentrated upon Mesopotamia and its immediate hinterlands to the neglect of eastern regions in the Middle East. In contrast to previous work, the focus of this study will be on cultural developments which took place in Baluchistan during the fourth and third millennia B.C. Besides simple data acquisition, research concerning this particular period in Baluchistan has broader implications. Two considerations are important. First, this chronological period encompasses the development of the most complex prehistoric culture recorded for this area , the Harappan culture, more commonly referred to as the "Indus Civilization." If delineation is sought for the cultural processes which influenced and created this complex phenomenon of Harappan culture, it must be within the period under discussion. It is possible, too, that delineation of these cultural processes may further analysis of similar cultural complexes. Second, recent research within this time period has suggested that the conceptual frame- work for analysis of relationships between Baluchistan, the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia be altered. The study of Baluchistan prehistory has other, broader theoretical implications involving key concepts in archaeological interpretation and explanation. Until very recently, all analysis of Baluchistan prehistory has been historical. That is, there has been a major concern for the chronicling of historical , or perceived historical, events. Once gathered, the relevance of these historical events is self-evident and any processual explanation can be gained by an inductive study of these events (Binford 1968:269). The ultimate result of this approach views major cultural achieve- ments in Baluchistan as a product of cultural diffusion influenced by Western sources. Recent research (Dales 1971, 1973; Lamberg- Karlovsky 1972a, b; Mughal 1970, 1973; Meadow 1973; Dani 1970-71; Shaffer 1971, 1972), however, has questioned the construction of previous chronologies and stratigraphies comparing the relationship of the area to Mesopotamia. It appears now that a different analytical framework is possible for interpreting data of the Harappan culture, and it is suggested that cultural developments in Baluchistan are the result of processes uninfluenced by outside forces. As an attempt to define the cultural patterns a systemic, processual analysis (after Binford 1965, 1968) of data from this period can already be offered (Shaffer 1972) . The cultural phenomena are seen as the creation of indigenous factors . 224 Arctic Anthropology XI-Suppl., 1974</page><page sequence="2">Shaffer: Prehistory of Baluchistan 225 PREVIOUS RESEARCH During the 1920' s and 1930's, surveys and excavations by Sir Aurei Stein, H. Hargreaves and N. G. Majumbar focused initial attention on Baluchistan as an area of prehistoric impor- tance. It is, however, data from two sites, Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, which firmly established the antiquity of the area and indi- cated the complexity of existing cultural pheno- mena. Excavations at these sites, and additional work at Chanhu-daro, continued intermittently into the 1940* s. After the war, Sir Mortimer Wheeler (1953) and Piggott (1950) contributed classic syntheses of research in the area. The excavation at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa initiated concern in two areas: explanation of the origin and decline of the culture (s) responsible for the two sites, and delineation of the extent of contact between this area and that of Mesopotamia if any. Emphasis on these analytical concerns has formed the basic research framework for post-war excavations in Baluchistan. Both Afghanistan and Pakistan have con- tinued to host archaeological field activity, and the excavations by Casal (1961) at Mundigak (Afghanistan) are perhaps the most significant with the development of a pre-Harappan urban center clearly defined. Still, many excavations have produced limited stratigraphies and ceramic sequences. Thus, there is a lack of consensus about any complex of traits which might be termed "pre- or early Harappan." The view is generally taken that major cultural innovations in Baluchistan were late in time and the result of a western, i.e.,' Mesopotamian, influence. This influence may even have included migration. The ultimate interpretative model, then, for the prehistory of Baluchistan has become one based on the concept of cultural diffusion. DIFFUSIONARY ANALYTICAL MODELS IN ARCHAEOLOGY Theoretical models now utilized for analysis of cultural diffusion are refinements of an earlier interpretation by Dixon (1928:59-106) . Dixon defined two basic kinds of cultural diffusion: 11 primary" - the spread of culture traits within the original area of origin, and "secondary" - the spread of culture traits beyond the boundaries of a given culture area. Transferrai mechanisms of both primary and secondary diffusion differ mainly in degree , with culture traits being subject to greater modification in secondary diffusion. Secondary diffusion has interested archaeologists most, and Clarke (1968:413-431) has posited six theoretical models for analysis of secondary diffusion. However, especially for the area of Baluchistan, two analytical models, the culture creep model and the stimulus/bow wave model, have been most used and are examined below. Analysis of Baluchistan Prehistory Culture Creep Model This model is applicable when two widely separated culture areas have similar culture trait complexes. Clarke (1968:420-422) has subdivided this model, somewhat confusingly, retaining the original name for one subdivision and suggesting the term "invasion model" for the alternative approach. The alternative approach is treated first. Invasion Model This model states that a culture previously alien to a particular geographic and cultural area can move into that area . That is , the area may already have been occupied by another culture. Nearly every summary of Baluchistan has used this model to offer reasons for the decline of the Harappan culture. Moreover, the model suggests that this means of cultural diffusion was responsible for all cultural innovations in Baluchistan. Thus in the upper levels of excavation at Mohenjo-daro, there appeared to be archaeological proof for Aryan invasions into the area. These invasions were considered a cause for the demise of Harappan culture . By analogy, similar explanations were acceptable in interpreting observed changes in earlier culture periods. Baluchistan was viewed as the recipient of culture traits and ideas carried by various transient peoples. As Allchin and Allchin say: Through it (Baluchistan) wave after wave of immigrants and merchants have passed traveling both to and from India proper (1968:320). D. H. Gordon is even more explicit: It must be admitted, however, that such a widespread change over a considerable area from food- gathering to peasant farming and from communities in most cases with no pottery, to an equally widespread use of wheel-thrown pots, with decoration showing a long tradition of this art behind it, must be the result of the arrival of a considerable body of people who were accustomed to this more civilized mode of life (1960:36).</page><page sequence="3">226 Arctic Anthropology XI-Suppl. Theories of direct invasion are still in vogue for interpreting Baluchistan prehistory, especially in reference to Harappan culture (i.e. , Raikes 1968:141). Culture Creep Model Culture creep diffusion is: . . .the chance resemblance of influences and elements drawn from neighboring areas which have independently diffused to a distant area where they reform an apparent unit complex from a common tradition (Clarke 1968:421). Elements diffused are subject to the channeling constraints of geographical and ecological factors . Clarke notes this model of cultural diffusion is commonly used in analysis of European prehistory. It is also prevalent in the study of Baluchistan prehistory. Childe, for example, who used this model in his work on European prehistory, extended its service to analysis of Baluchistan data. This is most clearly seen in his dis- cussions of distributions of the potter's wheel and metallurgy (Childe 1954:204-206, 228-244). Piggott (1950:50, 129-130) also subscribed to this specific interpretation, not only for Baluchistan but for analysis of most Indian data as well. Because he recognizes that direct movements into the Indian area by other different peoples occurred, his general conclusion is: So far as India is concerned, therefore, we must look westwards for the introduction of the arts of agriculture , and it will be seen throughout this book how the Indian material can be properly understood only in terms of its general Western Asiatic setting (1950:50). Allchins1 most recent summary work (1968) repre- sents a further use of both the invasion and culture creep models. Thus they say that while immigrations of other peoples were responsible for culture change, changes may have also resulted from the arrival of "new influences" from the West. Stimulus /Bow Wave Model Clarke defined this model as: . . .the like responses to like needs pre- cipitated by outside stimulus not Itself copied or adopted (1968: 422). According to Clarke, this type of cultural diffusion is particularly appropriate for explana- tions concerning situations involving religious and/or technological innovations . This diffusionary model for analyzing Baluchistan prehistory has been adopted by many archaeo- logists as a companion explanation to the culture creep model. In his last two summaries of the Indus Civilization, Wheeler has explicitly used this interpretation with, however, some equivocation. Discussing cultural developments in Baluchistan during the third millennium, he states cate- gorically that stimuli for observed cultural developments came from the west - from the Zagros Mountains and Mesopotamia (1968:23). Thus, the west was the source of ideas which resulted in Harappan culture: But it can at least be averred that, however translated , the idea of civilization came to the Indus from the Euphrates and Tigris, and gave the Harappans their initial direction, or at least informed their purpose (1968:135). On the other hand, in further discussing relation- ships between Baluchistan cultures and the Harappan, Wheeler asserts: None of them shows any clear primary and organic relationship with the Indus-Valley culture, which remains obstinately a creation of its own lowland environment (1968:9). Thus, Harappan culture is equally viewed as a creation of its own environment (Wheeler 1966: 61-62, 1968:135). Fairservis (1971:102-105) attributes the raison d'etre for various culture complexes in Baluchistan to the diffusion of early farming complexes from the western Plateau. The original source of this diffusion (Fairservis 1971:223) was attributed to an Ubaid-related Horizon defined by Dyson (1965:218-219). According to Fairservis, the raison d'etre for the Harappan culture was the result of an eastward diffusion of an Early Dynastic-related Horizon (Dyson 1965:219-220) . The interpretations of Wheeler and Fairservis are generic with the conclusions reached by Braidwood and Willey (1960:330) in their symposium on the development of urbanism. Consistent with this approach was the discussion of Baluchistan presented by Sankalia. In his paper, Sankalia (1960:79) views Baluchistan cultures as the result of diffused culture traits which originated in the Western Iranian Plateau.</page><page sequence="4">Shaffer: Prehistory of Baluchistan 227 The conclusions reached by Sankalia and others in the symposium supported Braidwood and Willey's (1960:355) view that the urban way of life was developed in southern Mesopotamia and from there became disseminated to the rest of the Old World. This dissemination was described as the "Ubaid 'oikoumene'" since it was the spread of an idea or concept rather than a par- ticular culture complex (see also Adams 1966: 20-24). The above discussion of diffusionary models includes all major interpretative efforts which have so far concerned themselves with Baluchistan. However, recent excavations by Dani (1970-71), Lamberg-Karlovsky (1970, 1972a), Mughal (1970, 1973), Meadow (1973) and Shaffer (1971, 1972), together with new radiocarbon dates, have restructured the comparative stratigraphies and absolute chronologies of Baluchistan to such a degree that the validity and usefulness of these diffusionary models is now questioned. RECENT RESEARCH During the 1960's and 1970's, new areas in Baluchistan opened to archaeological investigation while research continued at previously defined sites. Space prevents a detailed discussion of all recent research (cf . Shaffer 1973) but certain important considerations can be examined . A turning point. in the prehistoric interpretation of the area is George Dales' summary article (1965) . Dales organized an interpretative framework for correlation of total archaeological assemblages in Baluchistan. Although he attributed initial stimulus for change to the Near East, there was no emphasis given to "Ubaid/Early Dynastic Horizons , " invasions or to cultural traits diffusing from the west. Rather, Dales attempted to develop a framework which emphasized that cultural phenomena witnessed in the area were the result of indigenous cultural processes. Although Dales made no attempt to provide an analytical framework for explanation of phenomena in indigenous terms, his neglect of foreign parallels and his emphasis upon internal develop- ments foreshadowed more recent interpretations concerning the area. Excavations at Tal-i-Iblis were the first to indicate that the areas to the east had a much more extensive and autonomous cultural develop- ment than earlier anticipated (Caldwell 1967) . Tal-i-Iblis had an extensive cultural sequence spanning the mid-fifth millennium B.C. to historic times. The prehistoric ceramics demon- strated a distinct regionalization but were also comparable to contemporary ceramic industries defined to the west (Ubaid, Sialk II), and, during the third millennium, ceramic parallels could be ascertained for Mundigak in the east. Associated with these early levels were trade items of exotic material, primarily beads manu- factured from turquoise and shell of Indo- Pacific species. Perhaps the most impressive cultural manifestation encountered at Tal-i-Iblis was the presence in the earliest levels of an extensive town settlement with sophisticated architecture and evidence of an early copper ore smelting complex dating between 4400 and 4200 B.C. By the third millennium, copper smelting was so extensive at the site that Caldwell (1967:38) suggests the presence of a cottage-type industry smelting copper for export. The excavations at Tal-i-Iblis produced three important observations concerning the cultures of the eastern Iranian Plateau: 1) there existed sophisticated cultural phenomena (including metallurgy) at an unsus- pected early date, 2) there had been external interactions with other areas represented by imported items and 3) the cultural phenomena uncovered might represent an indigenous develop- ment. More importantly, in interpreting the evidence from Tal-i-Iblis, Caldwell (1967:38) introduced his concept of "interaction spheres" into the conceptual framework of Middle East prehistory, a concept which has been utilized by subsequent researchers and which has sub- stantially modified frameworks for analysis of cultural phenomena in this area. At Tepe Yahya, Lamberg-Karlovsky (1970, 1971, 1972a, b) has utilized Caldwell's contributions to aid analysis of data from one of the more important excavations in recent times. Tepe Yahya has proved to have an extensive cultural sequence stretching from a fifth millennium Neolithic to the Partho- Sa sania n period (A.D. 300). However, the periods of concern here are the "Yahya and Proto-Elamite Periods." Like Tal-i-Iblis, the ceramics at Tepe Yahya demonstrated a continuity of develop- ment from one major period to another. However, the similarities between ceramics at Tepe Yahya and those farther to the east were more pronounced than at Tal-i-Iblis. More important, located in these levels were intrusive potsherds from Baluchistan (albeit only two were in a stratified context and one in a surface context) dating to the first half of the third millennium. Other intrusive objects identified for these periods were: beads and pendants manufactured from mother-of-pearl, turquoise, ivory and carnelian. In addition several examples of early metallurgy were found as well as alabaster and marble fragments . A highly developed local steatite carving industry was also delineated. The quality and quantity of these steatite objects</page><page sequence="5">228 Arctic Anthropology XI-Suppl. reached such dimensions by the Proto- Elamite period that Lamberg-Karlovsky hypothesized their use in a system of "international trade" linking the area of Tepe Yahya with Mesopotamia (1970) . He also suggests that these steatite vessels were probably exchanged as gifts between leaders creating a situation similar to that of the Kula trade described for the Trobriand Islands. Excavations at Tepe Yahya have contributed several new dimensions to the prehistory of the area. First, the sequence at Tepe Yahya supported that of Tal-i-Iblis in demonstrating a long history of cultural development for south- eastern Iran. The initial settlements at both sites exhibited a degree of cultural sophistication comparable to other fifth millennium sites in neighboring regions. Second, intrusive ceramics and trade items indicate a more extensive degree of inter societal interaction with cultures located both to the east and west than was previously expected. Third, this interaction was possibly based on a trade in steatite objects which affected not only cultural development at Tepe Yahya but also that of other regions concerned. Finally, there is the implication that a similar situation existed for Tal-i-Iblis with its extensive copper smelting indicating existence of specialized centers for production and trade of local resources (Lamberg-Karlovsky 1972b, Lamberg-Karlovsky and Tosi 1973). In Iranian Baluchistan, DeCardi (1970) has also delineated a sequence of cultural develop- ment which indicates indigenous cultural development as well as inter societal interaction. The initial cultural developments appear to be somewhat later in time than those at Tepe Yahya but equally distinct. Close ceramic parallels can be made between these Bampur Valley sites and that of the later levels at Mundigak (III) . The later periods at Bampur have much closer parallels with Mature and Late Harappan elements as well as the Umm-an-Nar culture of the Persian Gulf. While Bampur lacks the time depth, it contributes significantly to the prehistory of the area by demonstrating that the initial periods are possibly the result of indigenous cultural developments, and that extensive intersocietal interaction occurred in this area at least by the second millennium B.C. Another important site comparable to those already cited is Shahr-i Sokhta (Tosi 1969) in Seistan. The earliest levels at Shahr-i Sokhta appear to be contemporary with Mundigak III and the later periods in Soviet Central Asia. Indeed, the numerous and strong stylistic and morpho- logical ceramic similarities between Shahr-i Sokhta and Mundigak indicate a very significant degree of intersocietal interaction was being maintained between these two sites. The importance of this site for the prehistory of the eastern Iranian Plateau is multifaceted . First, the settlement size and sophistication indicates that the site represents an early urban phenome- non for this region. Moreover, this urban settlement was the manifestation of indigenous cultural developments as indicated by the close ceramic similarities with Mundigak. Second, identification of an extensive lapidary industry in alabaster and semi- precious stones (carnelian, lapis lazuli, etc.) far in excess of reasonable quantities for local consumption indicates a possible industrial specialization for Shahr-i Sokhta similar to that defined at Tal-i-Iblis and Tepe Yahya (Lamberg-Karlovsky 1972b: 228) . Third, between Shahr-i Sokhta and Namazga in Soviet Central Asia, there are several important parallels in material culture indicating intersocietal interaction between the two areas (Tosi 1969:381, Lamberg-Karlovsky and Tosi 1973, Tosi 1973, Biscione 1973). The striking similarities in cultural phenomena which exist between Soviet Central Asian Bronze Age cultures and those to the south and east have been noted for some time (Piggott 1950:75) . Intensive recent work in this area by the Soviets (Masson and Sarianidi 1972) has increased the number of parallels in ceramic styles, metal artifacts, anthropomorphic figurines, stamp seals and burial customs. Especially in the later Bronze Age, there is increasing evidence of extensive trade with Baluchistan and the Indus Valley as reflected in trade ceramics, Indian ivory gaming pieces, metal artifacts and semi-precious stones (lapis lazuli) . It has been suggested that such sites as Namazga acted as points of redistri- bution for such exotic items to the north in exchange for items such as tin, and that this trade was responsible for the extensive inter- societal interaction and cultural growth witnessed at Mundigak and Shahr-i Sokhta. However, proper evaluation of this interpretation can only come with an increased understanding of the prehistoric record in northern Afghanistan. Bronze Age research in Afghanistan has been limited to the southern areas of the state and primarily to the regions surrounding Kandahar. The major excavation has been Mundigak, a prehistoric urban center (Casal 1961) . Other excavations have been more modest in scope and have complemented the sequence defined at Mundigak although they represent only village level of development. Deh Morasi Ghundai (Dupree 1963) was a small village which had a limited sequence comparable only to the latest Bronze Age levels at Mundigak. Said Qala Tepe</page><page sequence="6">Shaffer: Prehistory of Baluchistan 229 (Shaffer 1971, 1972) was somewhat earlier and appeared to be contemporary with the immediately pre-urban development at Mundigak. Despite the limited level of development at Said Qala Tepe, intrusive trade ceramics from Pakistani Baluchistan as well as the Indus Valley proper were located together with intrusive semi- precious stones (lapis lazuli) and a surprising amount of metal artifacts. The sequences of the two sites provided a quantitative check against that of Mundigak, and the intrusive items located indicated that this region was also involved in extensive intersocietal interaction at all levels of development. Among recent research conducted in Pakistani Baluchistan and the Indus Valley, the definition of an Early Harappan period by Mughal (1970, 1973) is relevant. Mughal (1970:359-383) has defined three phases of cultural development: Pre-Early, Early and Mature Harappan. The Pre-Early Harappan phase consists of the earliest assemblages reported at various sites and is characterized by wheel and hand-made ceramics, abundant lithics and only sparse architectural remains. While important, it is the Early Harappan phase which is of primary concern to the problems being considered here . Mughal maintains that there is no archaeo- logical or cultural discontinuity between Pre- Early and Early Harappan. The Early Harappan, despite numerous ceramic dissimilarities , has an overall basic cultural uniformity. This Early Harappan phase, as defined by Mughal (1970:361- 3 6 2), consists primarily of the cultural assemblage referred to as Kot Diji (Khan 1965) . The cultural continuity between the Kot Dijian material and the Mature Harappan was based upon ceramic similarities in form and decorative motif, ceramic toy-cart frames , wheels and triangular cakes , all of which are generally considered to be characteristics of the Mature Harappan and can be located in the mid-levels at Kot Diji. Furthermore, Mughal (1970:98-100, 117-124,156, 1973:12) has demonstrated that Kot Dijian type assemblages have a^ distribution which corresponds markedly with those of the Mature Harappan. Many of the sites concerned have only recently been excavated and reported upon (Kalibangan, Sarai Khola, Surkotada, Gumla and Jalilpur) . These sites appear to demonstrate that a continuity exists between the Early and Mature Harappan phases, and that many of the Kot Dijian cultural traits are found to persist into the Mature Harappan even at sites which appear to have been "abandoned" between the Early and Mature phases (for opposing views see Gupta 1972:395-405, Dani 1970-71:164-169). The proposed cultural continuity between the two phases has led Mughal to reject previous explanations for the origin of the Harappan cultural phenomena which invoked the various dif fus ionary explanations. Rather, he maintains that the Mature Harappan is the result of internal cultural processes which involved extensive intersocietal interactions as well as interactions with groups in the western hinter- lands . This delineation of an Early Harappan phase and the proposed continuum of its cultural development into the Mature Harappan represents a most significant contribution to analysis of South Asian data. It forces attention upon explanatory models which outline indigenous stimulation for the Harappan phenomena, and which, at the same time, take into consideration existence of external intersocietal interaction. The recent research discussed above has also resulted in the construction of new com- parative stratigraphies aided by radiocarbon dates (Dales 1971, 1973; Meadow 1973; Mughal 1970, 1973; Shaffer 1972). One outcome of these studies is the belief that although very distinct regional traditions (in ceramics) can be defined, there are a large number of stylistic similarities connecting the various areas . Moreover, these similarities, in conjunction with the distribution of intrusive objects (especially exotic items) and similarities in figurine styles, indicate that the regions main- tained a network of intersocietal contact. Despite differences, one point of agreement among most researchers in the area is that the cultural phenomena witnessed in Baluchistan and southern Afghanistan are an indigenous development demonstrating close connections with northeastern Iran and Turkistan. Furthermore, it is believed that influences from the west (Mesopotamia) did not occur until the first half of the third millennium (Dales 1971:151). Indeed, the new dates when corrected by the MASCA factor (Dales 1973) have brought the chronology for this area closer into line (i.e. , similar antiquity) with that of Mesopotamia. The obvious result of these studies has been to argue not only for the cultural distinctive ne ss of Baluchistan but also for its cultural autonomy from western developments. The new comparative and absolute chronologies have resulted in the establishment of a "long vs. short" controversy concerning cultural development in Baluchistan. Implications of a long chronology have been suggested for the studies cited. However, establishment of new long chronologies is not confined to Baluchistan (Renfrew 1970) , and their general acceptance has resulted in a re- examination of the validity of some basic</page><page sequence="7">230 Arctic Anthropology XI-Suppl. causal explanatory models in prehistory. Clarke (1973:10) has mentioned that short chronologies have resulted in the confusion of historical and archaeological time. Therefore, prehistory has utilized political, historical and ethnic explana- tory models in interpreting archaeological data. The consequence has been a prevalence of "invasion or catastrophe" models invoked to explain large scale phenomena which seemed to occur in short periods of time. The advent of long chronologies has resulted in either the invalidation of such explanatory models or their extensive modification with emphasis on social-economic-ecological processes rather than the traditional historical explanations . A review of some alternative analytical frameworks concerning Baluchistan prehistory is presented below. ALTERNATIVE ANALYTICAL MODELS Several of the most recent interpretative frameworks (Allchin and Allchin 1968, Wheeler 1968 and Fairservis 1971) have been discussed above and will not be repeated here. It is important to note only that they utilized various models of secondary diffusion (culture creep, invasion and culture creep, stimulus/bow wave) as an explanatory framework for Baluchistan prehistory. However, in evaluating these inter- pretative models, it must be kept in mind that they were advocated before the extent and sig- nificance of the revised chronologies were known, not to mention the additional data from recent excavations. Even so, one finds such secondary diffusion models still being utilized for compre- hensive explanation and interpretations of Baluchistan prehistory. Both types of secondary diffusion models are used by Dani (1970-71:166-169) in interpreting the cultural sequence at Gumla. The differences between Gumla II/III (Early Harappan according to Mughal) and IV (Mature Harappan) are accountable by a direct invasion and destruction of the Gumla II/III by a Mature Harappan group. In seeking an origin for the Mature Harappans , Dani turns to the "stimulus/bow wave" model. He maintains that the Harappan culture is the result of Mesopotamian influences transplanted onto an Indus Valley base culture possibly represented by the Kot Diji complex. In a recent study of Harappan pottery (which reminds one of McCrown's study of the Iranian pottery in 1942) Manchanda similarly invoked a secondary diffusion model of explanation. The so-called pre- Harappan cultures of India are, thus, the synthesis of Iranian influences penetrating through Baluchistan and Harappan influences radiating from Mohenjo-daro and Chanhudaro (Manchanda 1972:376). The Mature Harappan is also seen as resulting from an Indus Valley synthesis of various Mesopotamian and Iranian traits. In the same study Gupta (1972:395-405) specifically denies the existence of the "Early Harappan" cultural complex defined by Mughal. Rather Gupta sees the Mature Harappan as quite distinct from the pre-Harappan cultures as Kot Diji and points to its intrusive characteristics at most sites. Gupta would seem to concur in postulating a western origin and subsequent diffusion, eastward of the essential traits identified with the Harappan culture. From Manchanda1 s and Dani's studies it is apparent that diffusionary models continue to be utilized in constructing explana- tory frameworks for prehistoric Baluchistan. A diffusionary framework is also utilized by Masson and Sarianidi (1972) in interpreting the prehistory of neighboring Soviet Central Asia. Masson and Sarianidi have proposed a develop- mental continuum from the Mesolithic complexes to the early agricultural Djeitun culture. The Djeitun culture is seen as a parallel development of cultural processes which have been outlined for the Zagros complexes (Jarmo, Tepe Guran, Sarab) . Subsequent Chalcolithic and Bronze Age cultural developments, on the other hand, are interpreted as a result of "cultural infiltrations" and "population movements" originating in Mesopotamia or the Iranian Plateau. Therefore, despite recent intensive research, Turkmenia continues to be interpreted as an outpost of Mesopotamia (for an extensive review see Lamberg-Karlovsky 1973) and dependent upon diffusion for cultural growth . As previously noted, the most significant prehistoric development in Baluchistan to be defined was the "Early Harappan" period outlined by Mughal (1970, 1973). Without delineation of this cultural phase , there would be no alternative to using analytical frameworks based on the concept of secondary diffusion. The absence of such a phase would make it difficult to conceive the complexity represented by Mature Harappan as the result of anything other than diffusionary processes involving intrusion of peoples and/or ideas. Furthermore, without such a phase it would be difficult to evaluate the significance of the extended* chronology, artifact distributions and stylistic similarities defined in recent studies. As noted by Mughal and others (Dales 1973, Meadow 1973, Lamberg-Karlovsky 1972b, Shaffer 1972) , it is only with delineation of the</page><page sequence="8">Shaffer: Prehistory of Baluchistan 231 Early Harappan that attention may be concentrated upon the internal cultural processes which might be responsible for the complex Harappan phenomena (see Mughal 1973:15). These new explanatory models with their concern for the delineation of internal causal processes represent a significantly new approach to problems of Baluchistan prehistory and are essential to the research proposed here . As a result of his excavations at Tepe Yahya, Lamberg-Karlovsky (1972b, Lamberg- Karlovsky and Tosi 1973) has constructed an interpretative model for Baluchistan prehistory based upon "central place theory." Central place theory assumes that desired objects (goods or services) are produced/offered only at central points from which they are distributed to points of consumption. Tepe Yahya was one such central point based upon its control of steatite resources. External contacts are demonstrated by the presence of intrusive objects: ceramics, carnelian, turquoise, obsidian, alabaster, Persian Gulf shells , etc. Other sites which were similarly involved were: Tal-i-Iblis (copper) , Shahr-i Sokhta (lapis and alabaster) and Bahrein (transshipment of goods) . Trade mechanisms established for the utilization of these local resources brought the Iranian highlands into a supply-demand relationship with resource-poor areas - i.e. , Mesopotamia (Lamberg-Karlovsky 1972b: 22 8) . An identical role was ascribed to Baluchistan in its develop- ment of the Mature Harappan culture in the Indus Valley. The stimulus of desired resources and reciprocal trade established systematic inter- societal interactions between resource-rich and resource-poor areas. Intensification of these interactions resulted in a deviation- amplification feedback situation which culminated in the development of urban centers in the highlands (Iranian Plateau) as well as complex societies in the re source -poor areas (Mesopotamia and Indus Valley) . The advantages of Lamberg-Karlovsky1 s model are numerous. It accounts for similarities in cultural development because of parallel and/ or related cultural processes and not because of cultural diffusion. Extensive intersocietal interaction accounts for the distribution of intrusive objects as well as the similarities among various artifacts over expansive areas . Moreover, the model provides an explanation for historically documented Indus-Elamite- Mesopotamian relations which would be a logical outgrowth of cultural processes already functioning for over a millennium. Furthermore, the time needed for development of these processes was provided by the recently extended chronologies for these areas . In an attempt to apply Binford's (1968) systematic approach to analysis of Baluchistan prehistory, a similar interpretative model was outlined by Shaffer (1972) . A systematic approach requires a tripartite categorization of the data into: 1) the adaptive area, 2) traditions and 3) interaction spheres. The adaptive area concerns artifacts directly relating man to his environment. For Baluchistan, the major artifacts of adaptation to the environment were domesticated plants and animals. Moreover, these artifacts were represented by two modes of utilization. The first was the agricultural village located along major flood plains of perennial rivers and the second was represented by groups dependent upon a pastoral economy, who occupied areas not suited to agriculture between major flood plains . This bimodal adaptation had two important aspects: 1) it allowed for complete utilization of available resources and 2) the surpluses resulting from such bimodal adaptation were somewhat mutually exclusive , thereby creating a condition which would promote exchange between. social groups practicing the two. Traditions are concerned with those artifacts which demonstrate variation due to social context of manufacture, use or both. More simply, this means stylistic variation among locally-produced craft items , and in this instance ceramics. Examination of immediately concerned ceramics , in addition to published reports , revealed that there were at least nine major traditions definable throughout the time period under consideration here for Baluchistan (Quetta, Zhob, Nal, Amri, Kot Diji, Sothi, Bampur, Kulli and Mature Harappan) which can be defined by their distinctive styles. Interaction spheres are concerned with those artifacts which have a wide distribution and occur in a similar social context. In Baluchistan, such artifacts were found to include intrusive ceramics, metals, ceramic figurines, shell artifacts, steatite and semi-precious stones. Binford maintained that such a multidimensional frame- work of analysis would facilitate isolation of the various kinds and causes of cultural change and, in addition, provide a basis for the comparative study of such phenomena between cultures through time. Application of this systematic approach to Baluchistan data enabled not only isolation of the adaptive area and traditions liáted above but also delineation of at least two interaction spheres - trading and religion. The trading interaction sphere was bimodal in that it could be sub-divided into two separate but interacting</page><page sequence="9">232 Arctic Anthropology XI-Suppl. spheres. The primary trading sphere was the short distance sphere concerned with exchange of subsistence products between local social groups. Contrastingly, the longdistance trading sphere was concerned with distribution of certain artifacts (listed above with the exception of ceramic figurines) over wide areas. A religious interaction sphere might have been represented by the wide distribution of ceramic figurines throughout Baluchistan. These spheres, although distinct, were interrelated through a matrix of intersocietal relationships . The bimodal nature of the Baluchistan adaptive area encouraged surplus exchanges between agriculturalists and pastoralists . Seasonality and availability of pasturage forced migration of pastoralists from one region to another thereby bringing them into contact with various traditions via exchange of surpluses which was reflected in the distribution of intrusive ceramics. Such seasonal movement gave them access to items with limited sources of origin. Such items were among artifacts found widely distributed throughout Baluchistan. Items of long distance trade were in demand because of their ceremonial use and as a source of security against scarcity. This dual usage of long distance trade items provided articulation between the two interaction spheres . Articulation of these two interaction spheres would be as follows . The Baluchistan adaptive area encouraged exchanges between agricultural- ists and pastoralists. Pastoralists were forced to migrate from one region to another due to environmental and pasturage necessities. Such migration brought them into contact with other traditions and gave them knowledge of items of limited sources which were desirable for trading. These items were desired because their rarirty made them an avenue of expression for intensity in religious ceremony. Since every member of the social group is involved in cere- monies throughout his life, this provided a broad consumer base for items of long distance trade. This broad consumer base also made them a source of security, i.e. , something which could be converted into subsistence items in times of need. Therefore, since these items derived their value from ceremonial usage, it was to the advantage of individuals who possessed such items to propagate (if not intensify) the religious interaction sphere. The pastoralists acted not only as vendors of such items but also as a mode of communication between areas and helped create a commonality of ideas (concerning religion) which were reflected in the ceramic figurines. The above discussion of interaction sphere articulation is primarily descriptive and provides no explanation for the development of complex cultures located in prehistoric Baluchistan. In order to obtain an explanation for the complex cultural phenomena a concept referred to here as the " multiplier effect" must be utilized (Renfrew 1972:36-38). The "multiplier effect" is said to occur when changes in one field of human activity (or cultural system) favor changes in others which in turn enhance the original changes in the first system. One possible source of this effect was a population increase. A population increase in a semi-arid area like Baluchistan with its limited "zones of optimum production" would have resulted in an intensification of all interaction spheres. Because the zones of optimum production were limited, the short distance trading spheres were intensified by establishment of alliances based upon exchanges of long distance trading objects. Such alliances were constructed by individuals initially in control of original zones of optimum production. Therefore , these individuals could protect their ownership and validate their newly found status by intensifying the religious interaction sphere which was the basis of the worth for items of long distance trade upon which they had constructed the alliances. This intensification had two major results: 1) differential access to basic resources and incipient social stratification and 2) an expansion of the "zones of optimum production." Expansion of the "zones of optimum production" was accomplished only in source areas for items of the long distance trading sphere (i.e., Shahr-i Sokhta, Yahya, Iblis, etc.). The intensification of long distance trade would have transformed these source areas into "secondary zones of optimum production." At the foundation of all interaction sphere intensifi- cation was the maintenance of the ceremonial value for long distance trade items (the religious interaction sphere) . The above hypothesized population increase can be challenged. From ethnographic studies it has been shown that population size is one of the most highly regulated aspects of a culture's adaptability processes, and directly related to survival of the social group. Therefore, delineation of the multiplier effect might encompass a more general explanation which regulates population expansion to a sufficient condition of cultural growth rather than a necessary one. Indeed such an explanation may be found in the nature of culture itself - insurance of survival in face of environmental fluctuations. Baluchistan's environment is such as to promote times of scarcity with relative frequency. Therefore, cultures had to find some</page><page sequence="10">Shaffer: Prehistory of Baluchistan 233 mechanism providing for these periods of scarcity. In the Baluchistan instance this was accomplished by intensification of intersocietal interaction matrices, development of "secondary zones of optimum production" and incipient social stratification. Providing security against scarcity, then, was the kernel for growth of the indigenous prehistoric cultures located in Baluchistan, and perhaps other areas were faced with similar ecological adjustment. The above discussion includes data from all recent field research and considers already published theoretical interpretations concerning Baluchistan. Recent studies have not only increased our basic corpus of data from the area, but interpretation of the data has also resulted in major re-evaluation of older theoretical frameworks. More specifically, some important problems in Baluchistan prehistory currently facing reinterpretation are: historical versus processual explanations, development of an extended chronology and its implications , assessment of the role of trade and religion in development of complex societies , delineation of settlement patterns and their interpretation and delineation of the processes resulting in urbanization and the formation of pristine states.
