<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NATURE OF VERMONT. Introduction and Guide to a New England Environment. By Charles W. Johnson. The University Press of New England, Hanover (New Hampshire). $15.00 (hard- cover); $7.50 (paper). xii + 276 p.; ill.; index. 1980. Our biological education establishment has de- creed that only certain academic directions are viable. Pre-professional requirements dominate most undergraduate curricula, closely followed by molecular, biochemical and other quantitative ap- proaches, with some attention to taxonomy, bio- systematics and ecology. Degree requirements emphasize the quantitative; the qualitative and the sheer intellectual joy of knowing the natural world are rarely stressed, whether because we're embarrassed byJohn Muir, John Burroughs, and other naturalists of the nineteenth century, or be- cause there isn't much chance of obtaining federal support. The naturalist is, regrettably, a rare bird, and this in spite of the pressure to under- stand the environment and to interpret to an in- terested public the what, where and how of the natural world. We have pushed the pendulum too far to one side; breadth is as important as depth. Charles Johnson, State Naturalist of Vermont, has successfully attempted to redress the balance by writing about Vermont-a microcosm of up- per New England's natural history.

As an example, the flux and flow of timber cutting and forest regeneration, farm development and abandonment, hunting pres- sures and habitat alterations that resulted in the varying fortunes of the white-tailed deer, the bob- cat and alpine-tundra sedges are recounted in clear, well-flowing language. The intriguing sub- ject matter, unfortunately, is not complemented by the book's generally inadequate photographs and poor line drawings. With appended lists of areas to visit keyed to the chapters, the volume will be most useful to the interested visitor to Ver- mont and should have currency among biologists unfortunate in not being able to live in Vermont.
