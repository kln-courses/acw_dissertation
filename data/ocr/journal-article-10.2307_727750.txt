Oswald Jonas: Nachtrag zu Schenkers Aufsatz iber Schindler. Otto Vrieslander: Eine Stelle aus Chopins Scherzo, Op. 54. The first article examines in detail and in an interesting manner Schindler's reports on Beethoven's playing of the E major sonata, Op. 14. The whole thing is an extraordinarily illuminating aperfu of pianistic method from a source of the highest importance. The following article takes a wider field and examines what is reported from various sources of the method of others besides Beethoven. This number begins with the ominous statement that publication is henceforth to cease. And so another Viennese venture comes to an end. We could have wished it otherwise. S. G. Deutsche Musikkultur.

At the beginning of this number stands part of Herr Hitler's historic speech at Linz on March I2th. Next a canon (musical) to the words " Wir wollen sein ein einzig Volk von Briidern ". The reminiscences of Max Bruch date from I908, when the writer first met him in Berlin. Bruch was then one of the heads of the Hochschule and had twelve more years of life before him. As a document pour servir the article, with great names such as Brahms and even Bismarck mentioned, is of value. Rudolf Eras's contribution is an interesting and pleasing description of a flourishing local industry. June-July. Geleitworte. Kurt Huber: Volkslied und Volkstanz im Bajuvarischen Raum.

After a set of sentences celebrating the end of Austria and the beginning of Ostmark, the delicious illustrations (musical) to the first article seem to come from some distant era of friendliness and peace.

The composer told of in Moser's article is Heinrich Isaac (c. 1450-1571), whom Grove speaks of as being " the first of Germany's masters of music ". This article is copiously illustrated.

Alfred Einstein compares to-day with three hundred years ago and has some arresting things to say. The Ravel article ends with this: "He was, in Gautier's phrase, the supreme gardien du contour pur ", which is a label as true as it is well found. Thomson on swing has a good description of a "jam session " which he says " invariably sounds not unlike a Brandenburg Concerto, where every voice wiggles around as rapidly as you please, the rhythmic basis or centre remaining completely static and without progression or development of any kind ". It describes perfectly the devastating harmonic anaemia of the jam session. The article on new American composers hails David Diamond (b. 1916) as a prodigy of a wonderful prolificacy " not incomparable to Schubert's ". Session's article on opera confirms one's opinion that he is one of the most intelligent writers on music in America to-day. May-June. Roman Clemens : D6cors for Hindemith's ' Mathis der Maler '.

Roger Sessions's article contains the phrase " but I believe it is quite clear that if music is to have a future it lies in the United States ". In other words, what Vienna loses, New York gains. It may be so, and if we are to listen to any one prophesying on that question, let it be Mr. Sessions, for he can generally be trusted to know what is what. The note on film music has this: " Korda's other Wellsian fantasy, ' Things to come', was given to Bliss. Not a bad choice, this ". One rubbed one's ears. Was this a leg-pull ? One read on: "... but then the boredom of such an everlasting film was so overwhelming that even Stravinsky in his most ingenious mood . . . ". Stravinsky ingenious ? That superb mass of monotony ingenious in mood ? After all, then, it was meant as a leg-pull. Why, Stravinsky is about as photoginique as Guillaume de Machaut. The note on Bloch's ' Macbeth ' is informative and a useful preparation to what one hopes will be a quickly approaching performance here. S.

Ettore Romagnoli's special provinces were Greek tragedy, folksong and the borderlands of music and poetry in general. He will probably be remembered chiefly for his popularization in Italy of the Greek classic dramas-he produced ' The Clouds ' at Padua as long ago as I91I ; but he is commemorated in this obituary article mainly as a valued contributor to ' Musica d'oggi'.

Macari completes his account of these local folksongs, collected by himself and here printed for the first time. As he points out, they are notable for " the total absence of melodic ornaments, tonal alterations, and of technical virtuosity such as one finds in the folk music of other parts of Italy ". Mazzi's article has already appeared in the Paris ' Monde Musical . G. A. Musica Hebraica. Jerusalem. July I938. Nos. I-2. Joseph Yasser : Foundations of Jewish Harmony. Darius Milhaud La Musique Juive au Comtat Venaissin. Edith Gerson-Kiwi : Jerusalem Archives for Oriental Music. This is a new periodical, unique in many ways. First, this musical publication is edited by a dental surgeon and a newspaper reporter; secondly, it is devoted entirely to Jewish interests and printed in Hebrew, English, French and German. The most interesting among some rather uncritical and confused articles is Yasser's study. The New York scholar describes how his search after a perfect harmonic system for melodies based on the pentatonic scale (cf. his book, 'A Theory of Evolving Tonality') brought him first to Chinese and then to old Russian, Negro and Gregorian material. He has no doubt about the Hebrew prototype of plainsong and its pentatonic foundations, and he applies this theory to the cantillation of the Bible. He endeavours to demonstrate by examples that Jewish composers have often spontaneously reproduced certain features of the pentatonic system, and that their melodies have thus been influenced by Biblical chant. Milhaud writes about the Jewish population of a region of Southern France and its music. Jews are said to have settled there during the 480</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS OF PERIODICALS Roman era. We know that Milhaud himself has turned to subjects connected with this part of his country (in the opera ' Esther de Carpen- tras' and in his ' New Year Liturgy' and 'Prayers for the use of Jews in the Comtat Venaissin'). Dr. Edith Gerson-Kiwi describes the archives of Dr. Lachmann, a scholar well known for his research into Oriental music and his collection of some I,5oo recorded melodies, including Oriental women's songs. " This class of song is of particular interest for research since, through the strict seclusion of Oriental women from the outer world, music of an extraordinarily early period and high purity has been preserved." The production of the volume is quite attractive, though there are some amusing errors in the English, as, for instance, where a symphonic work is said to have solo parts for three " hornpipes " (horns) ; but the general level of the publication leaves much to be desired and a worthier presentation would have served the cause much better.

Graziosi's thoughtful article comes to this conclusion: "The complex of gifts possessed by an interpreter is not to be summed up as what is called ' genius ', but rather as artistry and craft (ingegno)-the ability to discover, participate in and reproduce the genius of art ". Among the great composers Chopin lends himself to the greatest varieties of inter- pretation; and why ? Because Chopin is the most "lettered ", the most psychological, and contains something for all temperaments. Debussy imposes himself on the executant much more than Chopin does; a modest pianist finds the Debussyan tone much sooner and more successfully than the Chopinian because in Debussy there is a greater clearness and formal coherence. Similarly Graziosi holds Beethoven, Wagner and Verdi to be more and less than artists; their humanity is so strong that it often bursts the banks of the channel of pure style, Vol. XIX. LL 481</page><page sequence="5">MUSIC AND LETTERS overwhelming us and constraining us to participate-beyond and beside the form-in their feeling at its most empirically human and personal. Bach, Mozart and Debussy do not oscillate between points beyond art, but are central. They are without contradictions or oscillations, which are therefore forbidden in the rendering of their interpreters, while such contradictions are the charm of Chopin, Beethoven, Wagner and Verdi. A Bach toccata, a Mozart symphony, 'La Cathedrale engloutie' allow of only one interpretation. In Mozart either one recognizes and adores the light he sheds, " the slight and delicately palpitating gleam ", or else is hopelessly precluded from his poetry. Orchestral conductors are compared with the directors of cinema pictures. The classic conductor is the director who, unseen, is the creator of the film without participating in the action; the romantic is the director who also plays the protagonist. The latter runs the risk of " exhibitionism ", and " some of Victor de Sabata's performances recall certain superfluous and immodest close-ups of the German actor-manager Trenker ". The classic conductor, the true interpreter, " is centripetal with respect to the most secret and precious nucleus of the work of art ". Toscanini represents the type, as Sabata does the centrifugal romantic type. The romantic executant is in the greatest danger when the work in hand corresponds most fully to his personal predilections, and his excesses are most valuable when he applies himself to the transformation of ephemeral, bad music. " And this is, perhaps, Sabata's most peculiar merit." He asks: " Does not Toscanini's greatness reside in that 'coldness' and 'classicism' which are the ultimate expressions of a sacred respect for the score, a severe and scrupulous study of it, a purity of heart and of mind, and a complete lack, in a word, of that roman- ticism (understood in the artistic connection as a boiling and fermentation of temperament) which seems to form Sabata's fascination ? " But while the critic finds that Sabata often misses equilibrium between himself and the music in hand, he allows that his interpretations are always interesting, and he cites him simply as being " the greatest and most illustrious of romantic interpreters " R. C. Revue de musicologie. Paris. February 1938. Georges de Saint-Foix: La troisieme ddition du Catalogue de Koechel. Jane Arger: Sur un recueil d'ceuvres de Blangini. A handsome tribute from one great Mozart scholar to another (Dr. Alfred Einstein) opens this number. The remaining article deals at length with an eighteenth-century Italian musician and his activities in France. Of Blangini Grove says he was " a celebrated tenor-singer, teacher of singing and composer ". He would appear to have started his career on the basis of good looks, on the strength of which and a voice he left Turin for France, taking with him his mother and sisters. Such piety was rewarded. He became directeur de musique to Princess Pauline Borghese and, as this article points out, being an opportunist, one who knew the ropes, he climbed high. In the Biblioth6que Marmottan there is a beautifully bound volume of his pieces, bearing the arms of Pauline Bonaparte. The music is analysed here, and would seem to have small worth. S.

David: Les Rogations avant la lettre et le chcur des chantres au XVIe siecle avant J.-C. L. R. : A propos de la Messe dialogude. Among the royal musicians who have encumbered the path of the historian with compositions, mostly supposititious, Louis the thirteenth of France must be considered one of the most distinguished and his compositions the most clearly authenticated. " Incapable of applying himself to great affairs, but of sane and even acute judgment, Louis XIII excelled only in a passion for detail and for manual pastimes." So far the Enc. Brit. Louis dedicated " sa Personne, sa couronne et ses sujets" to the Virgin and himself attended to the details of the celebrations for this event by composing an ' Exaudiat', to be sung in all the churches in France. He is said also to have written a ' Psaume de psaumes ' and it is the literary text of that which is given here, the music unfortunately not being included. M. Gastoue continues his valuable paper on 'Le Chant gallican'. M. David's article is important. It deals with a Cretan vase dating from the Minoan period of 1580-1450 B.C. The author examines a portion of the bas-reliefs on this vase which portrays a "groupe des chantres". His conclusions, too noteworthy to be compressed into this short notice, are commended to the attention of specialists. S. G. Revue Internationale de Musique. Brussels. May-June I938. Charles van den Borren concludes his article, begun in the first number of this handsome magazine, on ' La purete du style et l'interpre- tation de la musique du moyen age '. Among the points he makes is that in the music of the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries instru- ments were used in a proportion unsuspected by nineteenth-century students; that, while it was the usual thing for a vocal part to be doubled by an instrument, different instruments did not redouble the same part; that it was not the medieval practice to perform vocal or vocal-instru- mental compositions by instruments alone; that the notation of medieval music is, unlike that of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, generally 483</page><page sequence="7">MUSIC AND LETTERS complete in itself, apart from accidentals. On this last point the author observes : " What is above all important in this connexion is not to be influenced by modern harmonic conceptions. . . . The essential thing is to regard the independent melodic progress of the voices and to avoid alterations that disturb their naturalness ". He goes on to plead for recognition of the sensibility of medieval composers, with interesting quotations pointing not only to the personal'feeling that prompted their art but also to the fact " that the executants were charmed and sub- jugated by the beauty of what they were called upon to interpret ". Mahmut Ragip Kosemihal deals principally with Turkey in his article on music in the Balkans. He tells us that from about 1830 the Constantinopolitan aristocracy was interested in western music, and that in the time of the Sultan Abdulmedjid the palace boasted two orchestras, one of men, the other of women musicians. The latter pro- vided music for the imperial harem. The players were dressed as men. Unfortunately, the economical Sultan Abdulaziz withdrew support from the interesting institution. Ill-starred, too, was Guedik Pasha's theatre. The Sultan Abdulhamid, witnessing there a ballet in which the dancers were, in accordance with the subject of the piece, armed to the teeth, took alarm, forbade the performance, and ordered the demolition of the theatre. The author gives a chronological list of the musical institutions of pre-War Constantinople and mentions the establishment in 1925 of a Conservatory at the new capital, Angora, where there is no charge for admission to the symphony concerts. Apparently the great difficulty in the way of organized music at Constantinople is the fact that well-to-do people live so far from Stamboul (on the islands, at Scutari, and up the Bosporus), and also that students are allowed to attend concerts only on Sundays. But the Government has obtained the services of eminent western musicians at both Conservatories, and the author ends his article by speaking of young Turkey's enthusiasm for art, which is associated with the sentiment of national revival. Petro Petridis, writing on music in Greece, describes a number of composers whose names are unfamiliar in the west. The late Emile Riadis, of Salonica, left " magnificent specimens of Greek song" and unpublished symphonic and choral works. George Poniridy, a Con- stantinopolitan who studied with Vincent d'Indy, "excels in religious choral works revealing a mysticism and lyricism in the best Byzantine vein ". Mario Varvopli, a pupil of Xavier Leroux, is gifted " with a delicate lyric inspiration ". He has written an opera, 'St. Varvara '. Dimitri Levidis is " the wistful author of symphonic ballets and songs of strong Oriental colour ". Th. Spathy is an outstanding violinist, con- ductor and composer of songs and of an opera. George Sklavos has written operas and symphonic works, and A. Evanghelatos some con- siderable chamber music. Ch. Perpessa " has, like many others, sacrificed to the gods ofatonality ". N. Skalkota has made orchestral arrangements of folk dances. The spokesmen for the United States and Poland are Irving Schwerke and Alexander Tansman, and Jaroslav Tomisek has a substantial article on the present position in Czechoslovakia. Also to be mentioned is Andre Gide's charming paper on Chopin, a revised version of an article that had appeared in the ' Revue musicale ' in 1931. R.

The two premieres noticed here are those of Hindemith's ' Mathis der Maler' in Zurich and Honegger's 'Jeanne d'Arc au bucher' at Basel. Of the former much has already been heard. The latter is less well known. It appears to be choral and orchestral music for a stage setting designed for Ida Rubinstein, the action and words by Paul Claudel. The article on writing for the films is more amusing than instructive. Nevertheless it gives a devastatingly clear picture of the abysmal depths to which the musician, taking his music with him, must sink in an endeavour to compass the ridiculous demands of film technique. Literally the music has to be turned out by the yard. The thing becomes a mere matter of measurement. Inspiration comes in where it can. July Ist. Hermann Scherchen: Gedanken fiber Beethovens V.

There is next a useful article on medieval liturgical music, a model of research and inquiry. S. G. Science Progress. London. July 1938. This is a quarterly review of scientific work. The current number contains an article on 'Jets musically inclined', by Dr. G. Burniston Brown, University College, London; it includes diagrams and two plates. Jets of air or water have interested natural philosophers, as well as other folk, for centuries. They were a favourite study with Leonardo da Vinci; Botticelli depicts jets in his ' Birth of Venus ', and, as the author shows, depicts them wrongly. Tyndall, Kelvin, Rayleigh and many others, have speculated and written about them. The musician is interested because the mechanism of the jet lies at the root of tone production in nearly every wind instrument. The instrument maker's approach to the problem is largely empirical, but it is worth remembering that scientists are continually striving to widen the rational basis of our knowledge, a worthy object to which the author makes his own contribution.

According to Ostretsov, the composer has failed owing to his wrong approach; he has concentrated " not on the ideological basis of this deeply moving theme, but on purely episodic moments and superficial details ". Or in Beethovenian language there is too much " Malerei " and not enough " Ausdruck der Empfindung "-a criticism that epitomizes one aspect of the contemporary official Soviet attitude to musical aesthetics.

The Gorky article in particular is full of interest. As a young man Gorky had sung in the chorus of the opera at Kazan-by his own account he was " a very tolerable second tenor " -and his love of music in general and singing in particular never died. As Shaporin says, he possessed (like one of his own heroes) " a singing soul ". And he was more than a mere amateur of Russian folksong. Shaporin heard a composer tell him that he (the composer) proposed to introduce a certain unpublished folktune in his new opera. " Unpub- lished ? " said Gorky. " It is printed in Maximovich's collection ". And he at once named the precise year of publication. In the course of his 'Golden Cockerel' essay, a first-rate piece of style-criticism, Protopopov quotes a letter from Korsakov to Findeisen (October 1898) : "Yes, I'm a true Glinka-ist, although I've learned from Wagner a great deal in harmony, instrumentation and other matters ". The ' Sadko ' letter is concerned with theatre intrigues against the conductor V. I. Suk. Some of Tchaikovsky's letters to Bessel were printed in the publisher's own reminiscences of the composer, others in Modest's great biography and in periodicals. The twenty-five letters and the telegram here brought to light for the first time are of considerable interest.

"He is a Jew, and since music, even more than any other species of art, is the expression of national character and of the people's soul, Mendelssohn cannot possibly be a prominent German composer."
