<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Biblical Approach to the Doctrine of the Trinity. By G. A. F. Knight. Pp. 78. (Scottish Journal of Theology Occasional Papers No. 1.) Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd Ltd., 1953. 6s. The author of this booklet which contains four lectures delivered in Melbourne in 1950 does good service in recalling Christian theologians to a reconsideration of the Old Testament thought forms out of which the Christian faith sprang and which constitute its inescapable back ground. The book may do much to secure a continuity t&gt;f thought be tween the Old and the New Testaments in the theology of the Trinity and to establish the roots of that theology in the Old Testament record of the experience of God which Israel enjoyed in a unique way. It does justice to Hebrew anthropomorphism which is thought by some to be the vitalizing element in the Old Testament. Full attention is also paid to the gradual unfolding of God's nature in the story of his chosen people. The method of treatment is to review some of the terms of mediation : angel, name, spirit, glory, and face. The conclusion to which this leads is that the use of terms such as these shows that the Hebrews thought of God in terms of unity in diversity. One of the arguments in support of this conclusion is that the one</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 239 ness of God expressed in the Shema is to be interpreted in the same man ner as the one flesh which Adam and Eve became (Gen. ii. 24). Thus the oneness of Yahweh is a unity of the several diverse forms in which he appears. This interpretation leaves completely on one side the possibility that Yahweh's oneness is in contrast to the many Baals. It is well known that the Shema is not easy to translate and Mr. Knight evidently feels the difficulty for he has put two forms of it into his book. On p. 17 it stands as 'Hear, ÎŸ Israel, Jahweh thy God is one Jahweh' and on p. 47 (where the reference is given wrongly as vi. 5) 'The Lord our God is Jahweh, one'. Unfortunately, this is typical of much that is in the book and the present reviewer finds it profoundly disturbing for that reason. We are encouraged in the early pages of the book to remember that much Christian theology is built up on Greek modes of thought and expression derived in part from the Septuagint and on that account to try to recover an understanding of Hebrew modes of thought. This, of course, is wholly desirable. Less desirable is the use of a Latin phrase alter ego in the exposition of Hebrew thought for it does not in itself make the Hebrew easier of understanding. The phrase is used in the exegesis of Exod. xxxiii. 14-23 in the following way : 'Here God's face is clearly an alter ego of God, equated with the Name, and wholly equivalent to the Angel of the Covenant of Exod. xxiii. 20' (p. 29): In point of fact there is no specific equation of face with the name, the angel is nowhere called the Angel of the Covenant and the force of Exod. xxxiii. 14, 15 ('my face will go . . .') must be measured by 2 Sam. xvii. 11. In the latter passage Hushai counsels Absalom that his face should go to battle. Hushai did not mean 'let your alter ego go into battle'. As is generally recognized, 'face', like nephesh, when it has pronominal suffixes, can take the place of a strong personal pronoun. The passage means that God himself would go with his people. Again, we are told that 'God is indeed a communion within Himself, an organism, the Trinity' (p. 28). This goes beyond the evidence, which is that the Hebrews, seeking to express their unique experience of God, used terms like angel, name, spirit, glory, face, and wisdom. Taken together, they would constitute far more than a trinity, but taken separately, as they should be because they do not occur together or in the same writers, they are different ways of speaking of one basic ex perience, that of God on earth among men. Language is a limited medium to express religious experience. On p. 41 we read that 'Solomon built the Temple for the Face of God'. There is no Hebrew statement that can be properly thus inter preted and the author's next words reduce it to absurdity. 'Now', he</page><page sequence="3">240 REVIEWS says, 'since it is through the mouth which is part of the Face that the will is uttered, it is no surprise to us to find Amos can say a couple of hundred years after Solomon "the Lord roars from Zion" (Amos i. 2).' It is very regrettable that a book so admirable in intention should lay itself open to criticisms of loose exegesis. L. H. Brockington L. H. Brockington</page></plain_text>
