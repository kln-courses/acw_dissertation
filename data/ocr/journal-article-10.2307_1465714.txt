<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of the American Academy of Religion 68/1 (March 2000) AAR~ Response: In Defense of Social Scientific Naturalism: A Response to David Ray Griffin DAVID RAY GRIFFIN sums up J. Samuel Preus's and my common claims as threefold: 1) "that the academic study of religion should not avoid the task of explaining the origin and persistence of religion"; 2) that "any explanation, to be acceptable in the academy, must be a social scien- tific explanation"; and 3) that "any explanation, to be considered a social science explanation, must be 'naturalistic' in [our] sense of the term." FIRST CLAIM Griffin does not here dispute the first claim, but he puts the claim so weakly that his concurrence commits him only mildly. Yet the standard objections to the claim that he cannot resist noting-for example, the equation of explanation with reductionism-presuppose a stronger ver- sion of the claim: that explanation and interpretation are incompatible. Since the point of my Explaining and Interpreting Religion is that explana- tion and interpretation may be compatible, it is disconcerting to find Grif- fin thereby implying that my advocacy of explanation is at the expense of interpretation. As I state at the outset of the book, "Because there are dis- parate ways of distinguishing the two approaches, it is simplistic to assume that an explanation of religion is inherently reductive and an interpreta- tion necessarily nonreductive" (Segal 1992:1). SECOND CLAIM Griffin strongly contests the second claim. But since I assert in Ex- plaining and Interpreting Religion that religionists can explain religion and social scientists interpret religion, it is equally disconcerting to find Grif- fin saying that I equate explanation with social scientific explanation. As I similarly state at the outset of the book, "It is even more simplistic to 133</page><page sequence="2">134 Journal of the American Academy of Religion assume that social scientists can only explain religion and that the inter- pretation of religion is by default left to religionists alone" (1992:1). There is, after all, the tradition of interpretive social science. While some inter- pretivists pit interpretation against explanation (e.g., Clifford Geertz), others reconcile the two (e.g., Max Weber). I oppose the automatic com- partmentalization of the study of religion into religionist interpretation and social scientific explanation because religionists use that compart- mentalization to preserve their monopoly on the study of religion. By as- sociating explanation with reductionistic explanation, they then maintain that only they, by interpreting religion as religion rather than explaining it as psychology, economics, sociology, or anthropology, appreciate its true nature. Religionists want to save religion from social scientists. In my prior book, Religion and the Social Sciences, I do at times equate explana- tion with social scientific explanation, as Griffin cites, but I have come to change my mind. Still, I am prepared to respond to Griffin's way of refut- ing the claim. Griffin himself argues not that religionists should interpret rather than explain religion but, on the contrary, that religionists as well as social scientists can explain religion. Griffin offers a single argument for his view: that a religionist, or "theological," account of religion can be precluded only on the philosophi- cal grounds that an account cannot appeal to the existence of the holy, the sacred, or god. To preclude the existence of the holy as part of an account, social scientists must acknowledge and defend the philosophical under- pinnings of their accounts. They cannot say that they are mere social sci- entists and leave truth claims to philosophers. Griffin is confused. Social scientists do not bar an appeal to the holy by others. They simply do not make it themselves. Griffin demands that social scientists justify not only their own account of religion but also their failure to use Griffin's! Surely the only fair question, to which Griffin does turn, is whether a social scientific account is sound. More important, there are various ways of tying a social scientific ac- count of religion to the truth of religion. Most straightforwardly, the truth of religion means acceptance of the reality of the holy. Contrary to Griffin, most contemporary social scientists do not deny the reality of the holy. Rigidly restricting themselves to the origin and function of religion, they seek to determine why believers believe what they do, not whether what believers believe is true. In Peter Berger's phrase, social scientists are "meth- odologically agnostic:' Because I stress how most present-day social scien- tists "shun the issue [of truth] altogether and confine themselves to what for them is properly social scientific: the origin and function, not the ob- ject, of religion" (1989:57), it is surprising to read that "the negative impli-</page><page sequence="3">Segal: Responses and Rejoinders 135 cation of the Preus-Segal position seems to be widely assumed-namely, that insofar as causal explanations are proffered [by social scientists], aca- demicians involved in the study of religion cannot, by definition, argue for the truth of religion ... ." But by the "truth of religion" Griffin means more than acceptance of the reality of the holy. He means acceptance of a "theological" account of religion, which "argue [s] for the truth of religion in the sense of hold- ing that the best explanation for the existence of religion is that it arises from a response to something holy in the nature of things." The issue now is not whether social scientific accounts can be agnostic toward the truth of religion but whether they can be agnostic toward rival accounts of re- ligion! Furthermore, by the "truth of religion" Griffin now means not religious belief but religious experience-as if a theological account of religion must attribute religious belief to the experience of the holy rather than to, say, the cogency of arguments for the existence of the holy. On the one hand, conventional social scientists, sworn as they are to a rigid separation between the issue of origin and the issue of truth, would vigorously reject Griffin's characterization of the consequences of their accounts for the truth of religious experience. Griffin's failure to distinguish the issues leads him, not them, to the continual commission of the genetic fallacy, as when he says that, if sufficient, "these secular ex- planations, once provided by these social scientists, do show the falsity of religious belief by revealing that it originates in purely secular causes." In actuality, Freud, for example, declares that "to assess the truth-value of religious doctrines does not lie within the scope of the present enquiry" (Freud: 52). On the other hand, I, contrary to convention, do maintain that social scientific accounts can bear on the truth of religion, including the truth of religious experience. Still, I never claim that "social scientific explanations thereby deny the genuineness of religious experience" (Griffin). Griffin continually confuses rendering the truth of religion improbable with ren- dering the truth of religion impossible. I begin with Freud's attempt in The Future of an Illusion to show how the origin of religious belief, not just of religious experience, in wish ful- fillment makes it unlikely that the belief is true. While a belief can origi- nate in wish fulfillment and still be true-to say otherwise would be to commit the genetic fallacy-most wishes do not turn out to match the real nature of the world. It would therefore be extraordinarily coincidental if our fondest wishes did so. Similarly, while a belief can originate in pro- jection and still be true, it would defy the odds if our grandest projections proved to fit the world. I then generalize to all social scientific origins,</page><page sequence="4">136 Journal of the American Academy of Religion asserting that for them the holy is postulated on a basis which does not warrant the postulation, in which case it would again be most coinciden- tal if the holy turned out to exist. I argue that a social scientific account of religious experience can even bear on the truth of a theological account of religious experience. Account- ing for religious experience without resort to the holy makes a theological account superfluous. Moreover, an experience can be of the holy only if the holy is at least one cause of the having of the experience, whether or not of the seeking of the experience. A social scientific account challenges the truth of religion whenever a theological account of religious experi- ence is invoked to justify the truth of religion (see Segal 1989:75-86).' To his credit, Griffin grants that ifa social scientific account of reli- gious experience is sufficient, then the truth both of a theological account of religion and of religion itself is undone, though now by rendering either a divine origin or divinity itself superfluous and not, as elsewhere, impossible: "If a (nontheistic) social scientific account provides a sufficient explanation of that origin, then a theistic account of that origin is, as Segal says, superfluous" and "then the truth of religious belief in a divine re- ality would be undermined." But Griffin counters that no social scientific account is, in fact, sufficient. He deems insufficient not merely all specific accounts but social scientific accounts collectively. Why are social scientific accounts of the origin of religion insufficient? Because they deny the truth of religion, which once again means the truth of religious experience: "That is, although it has seemed to countless numbers of people that they have had genuine religious experiences, in the sense of experiencing a divine or holy power distinct from all worldly pow- ers, these [social scientific] naturalists declare that these experiences were not what they seemed to be. The epistemological assumption behind this a priori dismissal of the experiencers' self-interpretations seems to be the assumption that the sensationalist doctrine of perception, which rules out such religious experiences, is perfectly adequate for science and com- mon sense." Having argued that social scientific accounts assume the falsity of religious experience, Griffin now argues that that assumption makes the accounts not merely dependent on philosophical underpinnings but, whatever the underpinnings, outright inadequate. Why inadequate? Be- cause the accounts do not accept the truth of religious experience. Why need they accept it? The reason must be that religious experience is true. IBerger, beginning with A Rumor ofAngels, employs the social sciences to affirm rather than to deny the truth of religion. But the hope, humor, and above all order that he enlists the social sciences to document, in fact, presuppose the truth he is trying to validate. The world is experienced as hope- ful, humorous, and orderly to those who already believe in god. See Segal 1992:6-7, 117-118.</page><page sequence="5">Segal: Responses and Rejoinders 137 The burden that Griffin imposes on social scientists of accepting their rivals' accounts now includes accepting their rivals' philosophies as well. At least Griffin practices what he preaches: he definitely incorporates an assessment of truth into an account of origin. Griffin is again confused. He conflates not only truth with origin but also explanandum with explanans. The subject matter to be accounted for is not the reality of religious experience but belief in that reality. Both social scientists and religionists seek to account for religion, but to ac- count for why it is believed to be true, not why it is true. The reality of the holy is not part of the common subject matter to be accounted for but the religionist, or theological, account of that subject matter. If social scientists must account for not merely the acceptance of the truth of religion by ad- herents but also the validity of what adherents accept, then their accounts will indeed prove inadequate. How odd that Griffin considers biased the purported commitment of the social sciences to the falsity of religion but considers neutral the commitment of theologians to its truth. Ironically, the most influential religionist theorist of religion, Mircea Eliade, may himself be separating the truth of religion from its origin and function. For Eliade, religion succeeds fully at its task. If for him religion succeeds in providing contact with the holy, then the holy must exist, in which case accepting his account means accepting the reality of the holy. But if for Eliade religion succeeds in providing merely the conviction that one has made contact with the holy, then the holy need not exist (see Segal 1989:37-41). THIRD CLAIM Griffin offers an alternative argument against the sufficiency of social scientific accounts of religion: that they are not necessary! Here he intro- duces his rebuttal of the third claim made by Preus and me, our supposed assumption of the materialistic philosophy underlying the social sciences. Substitute a dualistic philosophy, and religion gets accounted for nonma- terialistically as well. Because Griffin confuses sufficiency with necessity, he sees no need to identify aspects of religion that cannot be accounted for by the materialistic social sciences-save for the truth of dualism. He sees the need only to establish that the social sciences presuppose a philosophy that others may not share. To be fair, he does cite various phenomena such as extrasensory perception and out-of-the-body experiences that, we are told, cannot be accounted for materialistically, but he cites no comparable aspects of religion itself. His case would be more impressive if he focused not on the inadequacy of the philosophy underlying the social sciences but on the inadequacy of the social scientific account of religion. He states that</page><page sequence="6">138 Journal of the American Academy of Religion the inadequacy of social scientific accounts has led "many thinkers" "to theistic explanations," but he names only Whitehead and neglects to dis- close which aspects of religion are for Whitehead left unaccounted for. Griffin's grasp of the philosophy underlying science is tenuous. Sci- ence does not mean materialism. If all natural scientists were materialists, the mind-body question would not be a scientific as well as philosophical question. Adolf Gruinbaum writes of "the myth that the explanatory stan- dards of the natural sciences are intrinsically committed to a physical- istic reductionism such that psychic states (e.g., intentions, fears, hopes, beliefs, desires, anticipations, etc.) are held to be, at best, epiphenomena, having no causal relevance of their own" (Griinbaum: 75). Like many natural scientists, some social scientists are materialists, but most are not. Griffin names Marvin Harris, but Harris is a professed exception, and even he does not deny the existence of cultural beliefs. He simply seeks to account for them materially. Griffin, apparently following Preus, misconstrues Tylor, who does not oppose religion on the grounds that souls and gods are immaterial. On the contrary, Tylor asserts that "primitives" conceive of souls and gods as material and that only moderns conceive of both as immaterial: "the later metaphysical notion of immate- riality could scarcely have conveyed any meaning to a savage" (Tylor: II, 41). Because immateriality is for Tylor a metaphysical concept, it runs askew to science. The opposition of religion to science is the opposition of only primitive religion to science, and the two are opposed because both are materialistic and therefore explain the same things (see Segal 1995:27). No one familiar with Freud's abandonment of his 1895 Project would label him an unqualified materialist. What of Jung, for whom the psy- chological is irreducibly mental? Even Marx does not deny the reality of ideology. He simply accounts for it economically. Since I call a "miscon- ception" of the social sciences the view that "a social scientific analysis of religion is materialist" (1992:13), I am surprised to be faulted for my com- mitment to this tenet of naturalismsam. Not only does science allow for dualism, but materialism allows for god. The Hebrew god, for example, is conspicuously material. Otherwise he would not be visible, audible, or touchable, would not walk in Eden, would not smell Noah's pleasing sacrifice, would not wrestle with Jacob, would not live in the Temple, and would not be male. The anthropo- morphic conception of god common to many religions typically assumes materialism. When, then, Griffin asks, "What is the basis, in other words, for assuming that the evidence that religious beliefs are always shaped by psychosocial factors also shows that they are not also partly rooted in genuine religious experience?", the answer should not be "nothing other than a prior conviction of the truth of naturalismsam, which implies that</page><page sequence="7">Segal: Responses and Rejoinders 139 we have no capacity to perceive anything other than material objects." And just as materialism does not entail atheism, so dualism does not entail theism. At best, Griffin can assert that dualism allows for some arguments for theism precluded by materialism. Other tenets of naturalismsam include "sensationism" and impersonal causation. By sensationism Griffin means the notion "that we can have no experience of anything beyond ourselves except through our physical sen- sory organs." If sensationism means that the senses are necessary for re- ligious experience, then many theological accounts are sensationist. Did Moses at the burning bush not hear God through his ears and risk star- ing at God (Ex. 3)? Not all theological accounts invoke a distinctly reli- gious faculty, the way Schleiermacher's does. If, alternatively, sensationism means that the senses are sufficient for religious experience, then few social scientists are sensationists. For Tylor, religion, while arising from sensory experiences like that of the immobility of the dead, involves as well the projection onto the world of gods who are then experienced: "They [i.e., primitives] could see ... the serpent gliding along the waving sword from hilt to point; ... they heard ... the chariot of the Heaven-god rattling in thunder over the solid firmament" (Tylor: I, 297). For Frazer, religion arises less from the experience of the world than from hunger pangs. For Freud and Jung, religion arises from the projection of innate drives or archetypes onto sensory experience. Griffin's sensationism bars innate causes. As for impersonal causation, Griffin conflates the denial of its oper- ation in the external world with the denial of its operation in the human world. Tylor, whom he singles out, does resolutely reject personal causes as the explanation of external events, but not as the explanation of human behavior. Outside of psychology, few social scientists have been behav- iorists-the best known is sociologist George Homans-and behaviorism invariably means the methodological behaviorism of Skinner rather than the logical behaviorism of Ryle. The existence of the mind is not denied. Since I make these points in my writings (see, e.g., Segal 1995; 1992:14), I am surprised to learn that I have "fully accepted the identification of sci- ence with naturalismsam." SOCIAL SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY Griffin asserts that I myself acknowledge the dispute between so- cial scientists and religionists to be ultimately philosophical, not empirical. For I do state, as he quotes, that "classical social scientists who do pro- nounce religion false-for example, Edward Tylor, James Frazer, Marx, and Freud-do not argue on the basis of their social scientific findings.</page><page sequence="8">140 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Rather, they do the reverse: they argue for a secular origin and func- tion and, even more, for the harmfulness or futility of the function on the grounds of the falsity of religion. For them, religion is false on philo- sophical, not social scientific, grounds" (1992:16). I would state, even more strongly, that those social scientists who assume religion to be false are often motivated to account for it by their amazement that a belief so bla- tantly false should be so widely and firmly held. Their philosophical judg- ments indisputably shape their accounts. But Griffin wrongly stops here. Social scientists do more than philoso- phize. They proceed to account for religion. Whether they deem religion false or, like later Berger, true, they still seek nonphilosophical sources for its hold. Those sources are psychological, economic, sociological, and anthropological. Since social scientists, at least classical ones, scarcely deny their philosophical starting point, Griffin's noting of it is no expose. If an account were a mere reflection of philosophical convictions, there would likely exist only two social scientific theories of religion. The array of the- ories suggests a loose link between "scientific worldview" and theory. If an account of religion were a mere reflection of philosophical con- victions, theological accounts would surely be as rich as social scientific ones. In fact, they would be richer since Griffin allows them to use social scientific accounts. Griffin notes that "Schleiermacher, for example, cer- tainly took great pains to explain how the (nonsensory) 'feeling of ab- solute dependence' could arise." But what needs to be explained is the step from the feeling to religion. Griffin deflects the issue by asking rhetorically whether my dismissal of Schleiermacher's account "perhaps simply re- flects a belief that nonsensory perception is unintelligible"-yet again mistaking origin for truth. We are informed that unnamed "other reli- gious philosophers ... have arguably done better than Schleiermacher." Have they done better than social scientists? Certainly later Berger offers no theological account of religion but instead a would-be validation of religion. Furthermore, social scientific accounts, unlike theological ones, link religion to the rest of life. They show how everyday, flesh-and-blood nonreligious factors cause religion and how religion in turn affects non- religious life. Contrary to Griffin, religion for social scientists functions as a consummately independent variable. Social scientists would not be interested in religion if it were not. By contrast, theological accounts like Schleiermacher's isolate religion from the rest of life and thereby accord it less clout than social scientists do. By definition, the social sciences take their cues from the natural ones. Too often, the social sciences have sought to be more scientific than the natural ones-for example, equating science with quantification, with</page><page sequence="9">Segal: Responses and Rejoinders 141 prediction, and with direct observation. But insofar as "social sciences" are sciences, they can hardly be faulted for taking their "worldview" from the natural sciences. If that worldview is as questionable as Griffin asserts, it is the responsibility of natural scientists to question it and of social sci- entists only to keep abreast of the answers. RobertA.
