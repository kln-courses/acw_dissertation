<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Maya snake dance Ritual and cosmology CLAUDE-FRAN?OIS BAU DEZ At Palenque, the architectural complex called the Palace consists of some fifteen buildings and three courts clustered on top of a 75-m-long, 55-m-wide, and 10-m-high platform (fig. 1). The history of its architecture extends over two centuries and six reigns. The functions of the complex, as well as that of its individual components, remain problematic. Few buildings seem to have been residences; some may have had administrative functions, but most seem to have been used for ritual activities. House D, located in the northwestern part of the Palace, was probably built during Kan Xul II reign (Greene Robertson 1985; Schele 1986). It consists of two long, parallel corridors communicating through a single narrow doorway at the southern end of the median wall (fig. 1). The eastern corridor of House D opens onto the west court through three doors; the western corridor faces the large stairway, which gives access to the Court of the Inscriptions, and seven rectangular piers make up six openings. These piers are graced with a stucco-modeled sculpture on their outer side, which originally was painted in several colors. The piers are designated in alphabetical order from left to right, that is, from north to south. It is assumed that the northernmost, now fallen, Pier A supported an inscription as did Pier G, the last one of the series; it would then have followed the pattern observed in House A, where the series of figurai piers is flanked by text-supporting pillars. A two-figure scene is modeled on Pier B: a standing individual brandishes an ax in front of a seated man who makes a defensive gesture (fig. 2). On Pier C, a standing figure with a large-size headdress presents insignia to an almost naked, kneeling individual (fig. 3). A man and a woman, facing each other, hold a serpent on Pier D (fig. 4). On Pier E, the stucco relief is almost completely missing, with the exception of a few details that indicate a two-figure scene (fig. 5). A standing man grasps the hair of a seated figure who is about to be beheaded on Pier F (fig. 6). Of the inscription that The present article by Professor Baudez was submitted in its current form and accepted for publication in Res in Spring 1989. The Editor covered the outer side of Pier G, only three glyphs remain: a birth verb, a woman's name, and a capture verb. There are no surviving texts to identify the figures in the scenes. Greene Robertson has suggested that the sacrificial victim on Pier B is Pacal I, based on her interpretation of the figure's foot (1985: 34). She noted that the proportions and angle of the foot suggest a clubfoot. She further noted that this kind of depiction of a foot is found on the figure of Pacal II on the Temple of the Inscriptions sarcophagus lid and concluded that Pacal II was clubfooted. Because clubfoot can skip a generation, she speculated that the Pier B figure might be the grandfather of Pacal II, that is, Pacal I. Why the sacrifice of Pacal I would be documented at Palenque is not discussed by Greene Robertson. Maya art is, I believe, more conceptual than visual, and thus gestures are more conventional representations than realistic depictions. I suggest that what Greene Robertson interprets as a deformity is simply an awkward treatment of a normal foot. The same author has also suggested that "all four of the figurai piers on this house concern some aspect of Figure 1. Palenque, The Palace. Drawing: Merle Greene Robertson.</page><page sequence="2">38 RES 21 SPRING 1992 sacrifice. Piers B and C concern persons about to be sacrificed. Pier F is concerned with the actual beheading. Pier D depicts a sacrifice about to be performed involving two people and a serpent" (ibid.: 33). Although there is no doubt that Pier F shows a sacrifice scene and that B anticipates a similar outcome, the connection of Piers C and D with sacrifice is unclear. I suggest that the piers of House D show a ritual sequence whose several scenes are to be read from left to right. This hypothesis rests on the observation that Piers C and D are sequentially related, in other words that the scene depicted on C is followed by the one on D. On Pier C, we see a standing figure?that we assume to be the king?bent over a kneeling and, it seems, almost naked individual (fig. 3). In his right arm, the king holds a composition that consists of a mask whose forehead is stamped with the kin (sun) sign, and that is topped by a three-part emblem, composed of a crossed-bands element, an autosacrificial spine, and a shell. Three jeweled serpents make up the top of the whole composition. Jeffrey Miller (1974) has noticed that the latter is a duplicate of the lower part of the cosmogram carved on the tablet of the Temple of the Cross; there the solar mask topped with the three-part emblem represents the earth as the abode of the nocturnal sun, and the jeweled serpents represent the trunk and branches of the cosmic tree (fig. 7). What the king holds in his right arm on Pier C, therefore, is a simplified version of the cosmogram depicted on the Temple of the Cross tablet as well as on the sarcophagus lid in the Temple of the Inscriptions. With his left hand, the king presents a grotesque mask with pointed teeth and a tuft of hair on the cheek. Some interpret this creature as the xoc fish, whereas others see it as a bat (Proskouriakoff 1961). A beaded tassel and ribbons hang from the mask; other falling ribbons were probably used to fasten it. This mask is most commonly a costume element attached to the belt of female?and sometimes male?figures. On Pier D, the woman who faces the king wears this same mask on her belt (fig. 4). The lower jaw of the xoc is a section of a Spondylus shell, and the whole mask is?but for a few exceptions?a female emblem (see, for instance, Naranjo Stelae 24, 29, 31; Altar de Sacrificios Stela 7; and Calakmul Stela 54). Although the mask is now missing, the woman wore on her back the image of the earth in the form of the mask of the dead sun. The three-part emblem has remained: the shell, the spine, and, instead of the crossed bands, the ci m i (death) sign, which sometimes replaces the crossed Figure 2. Palenque, House D, Pier B. Drawing: Merle Greene Robertson. bands and has probably the same meaning. The jeweled serpent is fixed in the woman's headdress. Given that the insignia presented by the ruler on Pier C are those worn by the woman on Pier D, one may conclude that C and D are two scenes from the same sequence of events. The scenes modeled on Piers B and F are also sequential. On B the king threatens a victim (fig. 2); on F he executes him (fig. 6). The ritual sequence may then be reconstituted as follows: Act I: Pier B (fig. 2). The king threatens a victim who is seated on a now missing seat. This seat was probably a Cauac monster mask, a conventional ?mage that refers to both the earth and sacrificial stone. The victim, dressed in a short skirt and a loincloth, has kept his collar, a sandal, and part of his headdress, but has lost his earrings. He makes a defensive gesture with his left arm. The king brandishes an ax, only to threaten him. He is not about to behead the victim, since he does not grab the captive's hair. This conventional gesture is a requisite in scenes of human sacrifice. The king is standing on a water frieze that runs the</page><page sequence="3">Baudez: The Maya snake dance 39 @ ? 9 WLIhwAlhrC Figure 3. Palenque, House D, Pier C. Drawing: Merle Greene Robertson. whole width of the pier; it is made up of the skeletal head of the earth monster with the /7c sign on the forehead as well as water symbols (circlets) and images of water plants and animals. The frieze?variants of which are to be found on every pier of our ritual sequence?is a picture of the watery underworld, the eternal source of plant growth and terrestrial life (Coggins 1983). The frieze signals that, symbolically and ritually, the action takes place in the watery underworld. Bishop Landa tells us that during the festival of a new cauac year, a dance called Xibalba ok'ot (literally, dance of the underworld) was performed. According to him, it was "like the muddy (cazcarientas) dance" (Tozzer 1941: 147). Here, as well as on the ritual sequence on House D, the concepts of dance, mud (earth and water), and underworld are brought together.1 Allusions to fertility, the ultimate goal m ? Figure 4. Palenque, House D, Pier D. Drawing: Merle Greene Robertson. of the ritual, are illustrated in the king's headdress, on every pier of the sequence. Here, a reptilian head emerges from a water lily flower. As on the other piers, the whole scene was probably framed by a chain composed of two alternate elements (only one?a stylized shell?can be seen near the victim's head). Act II: Pier C (fig. 3). From the left, the king walks toward his kneeling partner and presents him with the emblem he will be wearing during the dance: the cosmogram and the xoc mask. The king has a reptilian helmet that looks like an earth monster with an elongated snout, heavy eyelids, and long lashes. The helmet is crowned with a grotesque head drawn as a shoot growing out of a water lily. The figure facing the king is scantily dressed; his respectful and submissive attitude does not signal him as another sacrificial victim, but rather as the awed recipient of sacred 1. During the feast dedicated to the Tlaloque, the rain gods, the Aztecs performed their ritual in a swamp. There they forced some priests to plunge under mud and water ("zambull?ndolos debajo del lodo y del agua"). This "muddy" rite was followed by dances with maize stalks and human sacrifices. Pursuing the comparison further, it is worth noting that the temple, called Epcoatl (mother-of-pearl serpent), was used?mostly if not only?for fasting and penance, during the four days preceding the feast (Sahagun 1956, I: 232).</page><page sequence="4">40 RES 21 SPRING 1992 The le (leaf) glyph adorns his ear. Beneath the actors' feet the water frieze is formed by two horizontal bands with short lines and circlets that indicate water. The broken line that partly covers them represents the serpentlike body of the earth monster, which probably had a head at both ends. An "eccentric" knife with the sun sign on it is in the middle of the frieze, between the two horizontal bands. This is to remind us that the earth is the abode of the nocturnal sun, closely related to sacrifice. The chain framing the whole scene uses the jade bead and the yax sign; the latter's two meanings, green and new, are in perfect accordance with a fertility rite. Act IV: Pier E (fig. 5). Unfortunately, the stucco relief here is almost completely missing, and we will never know what this episode was about. One may wonder whether the destruction of the relief was not done on purpose precisely because the climax of the ritual was depicted on the pier. If we assume it exhibited the most sacred scene, it would naturally become the favorite target of iconoclasts. Very few details have been ? o a Figure 6. Palenque, House D, Pier F. Drawing: Merle Greene Robertson. Figure 5. Palenque, House D, Pier E. Drawing: Merle Greene Robertson. insignia. The figures are directly above a water frieze. Il consists of three skeletal earth masks that give birth to water lily stems, flowers, and pads. The whole pier is framed with an uninterrupted chain composed of two alternate elements: the jade bead and the "completion" sign. These elements have the meaning of "precious," according to some contexts in which they generally occur. Act III: Pier D (fig. 4). The right figure, a "woman" (most probably a transvestite male dancer) with her feet feet together, presents to the king a serpent she holds with both hands. She wears a short cape and a skirt, both adorned with a beaded network. On her belt, she displays the xoc-Spondylus mask, from which beads and ribbons hang. She wears the lower part of the cosmogram on her back, and its upper part, the jeweled serpent, in her headdress. The king is dancing, as his half-raised foot indicates. He grips the serpent with his left hand, and with his right he holds an ax. He has donned a richly adorned loincloth but does not wear his helmet any longer. An anthropomorphic shoot crowns his headdress that is divided into several locks.</page><page sequence="5">Baudez: The Maya snake dance 41 Figure 7. Palenque, Central Panel of the Temple of the Cross. Drawing: Linda Schele. preserved: a serpentlike helmet, a hand, a few pieces of garment, unclear fragments of a basal frieze, and the frame made up of the jade bead and the kan sign. Act V: Pier F (fig. 6). The protagonists of Pier B are found here at the same respective locations. To the left, the victim is seated on a squint-eyed mask with the T617a sign on the forehead. But for his loincloth, he has lost what remained of his dress and jewels. The king grabs his hair and is about to strike him with his ax. This instrument is adorned with ribbons and a water lily to remind one that fertility is the purpose of sacrifice. The water lily is also part of the king's simple headdress. The head of the earth monster from which water lilies sprout is the main motif of the water frieze. The anthropomorphic numeral six is seen to the left. The chain frame is made of the jade bead and an elongated ahau, used to indicate bone (and, therefore, death). The narrative on the piers of House D at Palenque is composed of a main sequence (C-E) between two scenes of human sacrifice. The main sequence is itself divided into three parts: a prologue in which the king presents to his partner the insignia required by the ritual; the action of the serpent dance; and the outcome that we can only guess. Continuity between these episodes is not only based on the semantic relationship between C and D as well as between B and F; it is also confirmed by the repetition of the watery underworld context. The water frieze that accompanies every episode indicates that the whole ritual is symbolically located in the wet and fertile underworld, and that fertility is its major purpose. The main actor, the king, exhibits symbols taken from this same universe that confirm the nature and goal of the rite. The unity of the sequence is also demonstrated by the inscription that runs along the facade and is common to all piers. The few glyphs that remain show that the first thirty-four glyph blocks made up an Initial Series (a date in the Long Count) above Piers B, C, and D (Greene Robertson 1985, III: fig. 241, "Reconstruction of Medallions over House D. Suggested by Peter Mathews"). The iconography of Structure XIV, a small temple</page><page sequence="6">42 RES 21 SPRING 1992 Figure 8. Palenque, Plinth of the Sanctuary of Structure XIV (after Acosta 1977). Drawing: Claude Baudez. Figure 9. Palenque, Tablet of Structure XIV. Drawing: Linda Schele. built during Chan Bahlum II reign, is very reminiscent of the stucco sculpture on House D. A water frieze consisting of the skeletal head of the earth monster, from which aquatic plants sprout, adorns the plinth of the sanctuary (Acosta 1977: fig. 13) (fig. 8). It is similar to the water frieze on Pier C, House D (fig. 3). The scene carved on the sanctuary tablet shows Chan Bahlum II dancing on a water frieze composed of two parallel bands framing a row of circlets of different sizes (fig. 9). Stepped half-circles, and ?mix (T501) and na (T23) signs, are found on the lower register. The top of the frieze is adorned with stepped rectangles, shells, and le (T188) signs. A kneeling woman presents a seated grotesque figure?usually referred to as "God K"?to Chan Bahlum. She wears a skirt and an apron, both adorned with a beaded network. A short cape with T-shaped (fertility) signs covers her shoulders. Her headdress is made of a serpent helmet with T61 7a on the forehead, a shell, a tassel, and the jeweled serpent.2 Thus Pier D of House D and the Structure XIV tablet 2. The text associated with this action employs a verb interpreted as "to hold the God K scepter" (Josserand, Schele, and Hopkins 1985). This event occurred when Chan Bahlum II was thirteen years old (Bassie-Sweet 1991). The inscription also refers to the place where this ritual was performed; although the place name glyph is itself undeciphered, it also occurs beneath Chan Bahlum II feet in the image (ibid.).</page><page sequence="7">Baudez: The Maya snake dance 43 have much in common; in both cases, a male is dancing on a water frieze while a woman respectfully presents him with a symbolic creature. Although this being looks completely different on the two sculptures?here a grotesque figure, there a naturalistic serpent?I contend that we deal with the same supernatural being and that both scenes refer to the same ritual. The grotesque that the woman presents to the male actor has a human body and a reptilian head. With his arms folded, he is seated tailor-fashion on a cloth. A "decorated ahau" sign (T179) crowns his head, and an elongated object with a double scroll at the end (T122) is stuck into a simple cartouche drawn on his deformed skull. Several T617a signs (so-called "mirrors") ornament his body. This creature, along with all others displaying the same characteristics, is usually identified with the "God K" from the Dresden codex. However, the Post-Classic God K has no object stuck into his Figure 10. God K: (a) Dresden 7a; (b) Dresden 25b; (c) Dresden 12a. God B: (d) Dresden 32b; (e) Dresden 40b; (f) Tro-Cortesiano 17b.

The Classic and Post-Classic Gods K are said to be the same deity because of the glyph that refers to God K in the Dresden. It is affixed with the double scroll, T122, which usually ends the object that sprouts from the forehead of the Classic God K. The identity of both Gods K is far from being demonstrated. In Classic iconography, God K is said to be a deity closely associated with dynastic power because he is equated with the Aztec God Tezcatlipoca, "Smoking Mirror" (Coe 1973: 16).3 According to Coe's hypothesis, the T617a sign on the forehead is "read" as nen (mirror), and the object stuck into it is interpreted as a smoking torch. Schele and Miller (1983) suggest that since tah (torch) and tah (obsidian) are homonyms, the mirror is made of obsidian. They observe that the protruding object may take different forms, referring to different things, while always giving the same meaning: "The mirror forehead of God K can, then, appear with an 3. A smoking mirror, emblematic name of the god, generally replaces Tezcatlipoca's foot. The deity sometimes wears it in his headdress, but never on the forehead or in front. @^?? '^**&amp; c? disais</page><page sequence="8">44 RES 21 SPRING 1992 ocote torch with smoke or flames, a ceramic torch holder with smoke, with a smoking cigar, or with a smoking celt. The mirror attachments all seem to function as phonetic complements to insure that the mirror is understood to be made of obsidian" (ibid.: 11). I do not see why the "mirror attachments" would all be "phonetic complements." Although the phonetic approach has been very rewarding in deciphering the Mayan script, the images must be considered as primarily made of icons or semantic elements rather than composed of signs with a purely phonetic value. The Maya may have used rebus forms in their images, but only if this technique presented any advantage over the simple use of "true" icons. Why not represent a smoking mirror as such, in the Aztec way, that is, a circular black thing with smoke rising out of it, rather than using the complex assemblage of rebus elements such as an abstract sign for mirror, a torch, and a smoke sign? The "smoking mirror" hypothesis, uncritically accepted by many scholars in the field, has major flaws. Obsidian mirrors seem to have been nonexistent or very rare among the Maya; when found in excavations of Maya sites, mirrors are made of a pyrite or hematite mosaic on a slate or sandstone back. On the other hand, T617a is ubiquitous, on bodies (where it is sometimes called a "god marking") as well as on the head of many supernatural beings. Besides God K, it is found on the so-called Jester God, on various representations of the sun (in human, bird, or jaguar forms), on God C, the xoc fish, and so on. What are "mirror" signs doing on lancets (Joralemon 1974: fig. 13), knife-tongues (Baudez 1985: figs. 4b, 8a), and tinklers (for instance, those hanging from the belt of the figure on Copan Stela N)? I had thought for years that the sign could have meant "stone"; this interpretation appeared as a common denominator for mirrors, knife tongues, jade tinklers, and the head of some supernatural whose skull is knife shaped. I came to the conclusion, however, that it was absurd to assume that so many heads or bodies were made of stone, even in a symbolic sense. I now think that T617a would more conveniently be translated as "sacred," because of its connections with the supernatural world. M. Coe (op. cit.) has rejected Thompson's interpretation of T122 as bil (a vegetal ornament), arguing that this affix was frequently found above the glyph for fire (T563), and therefore had to be read as smoke. However, T122 occurs in some contexts where smoke appears as meaningless, while vegetation seems to be the right interpretation. For instance, the double scroll that juts out of the skeletal head prefixed by the numeral 9; this emblem is one member of a pair formed with "7 Head," both being images of the earth (Baudez 1984: fig. 2). For the time being, I propose to interpret T122 as "emanation," be it plant growth, smoke, breath, or even speech. Let us also notice that the elongated object may occur without having T122 affixed at its end; thus at Yaxchilan most of the Gods K in scepter form have a smokeless celt plugged in their forehead (Graham 1979), as well as the three stucco wooden figures from Burial 195 at Tikal (Coe 1967: 57). Although several different Gods K may have coexisted in Mayan art and religion, the "flare gods" (another name coined for these creatures) from the monumental sculpture at Palenque make up a very homogeneous series (fig. 11). However, the contexts differ: either the creature emerges from the jaws of a serpent (a), or he is seated tailor-fashion on a cushion (b, c), or he is held on the lap as a baby (d), or only his head is shown at the top of a shaft (e). I suggest that the Classic God K represents a deity of lightning and thunder and is an aspect of the Post Classic Yucatec Chac or Chorti Chicchan. I think that the creature's head and the object stuck into it reproduce the hafted ax of the Maya, of which numerous illustrations exist in the Dresden and Madrid codices (figs. 10d-f). Either the celt is short and protrudes from one side only of the haft, or it is longer and juts out from both sides. When the top of the head is clearly visible (fig. 11e), it is bent out exactly like the tip of the Maya ax (figs. 10d-f ). This creature?in the guise of a hafted ax?is a thunderer because of the narrow relationship that exists between the stone celt and thunder in Mayan ethnohistory and ethnography. In the codices, God B, supposed to be Chac, the rain god, most often holds an ax (figs. 10d-f). According to Wisdom (1940: 392 397), among the Chorti, the "Workers" who are companions of the Chicchans, are lightning makers; with their stone axes they beat the water out of the clouds. "Lightning is caused by passage through the air of those stone axes; a spot or a tree hit by lightning is said to have been struck by an ax aimed to kill an earth Chicchan beneath" (Thompson 1970: 263).4 According 4. Tedlock (1985: 328-329) translates the Quiche expression pan caxil?from the Popol Vuh?as "broken place"; it refers to the "mountain or citadel where the Makers and Modelers got the corn and water needed to make the bodies of the first true humans ... the</page><page sequence="9">Baudez: The Maya snake dance 45 Figure 11.

(After drawings by Linda Schele.)</page><page sequence="10">46 RES 21 SPRING 1992 to the same source (ibid.: 253), the Mopan Maya call the celts baatchac, Chacsf axes, believing them to be thunderbolts hurled by the Chacs. The Yucatan Maya "ride across the skies . . . brandishing a machetelike implement called lelem, lightning, because it produces that phenomenon . . ." (ibid.: 254). Our thunderers (formerly called God K) are part human, part snake: their body is anthropomorphic with the exception of a reptilian head and of one leg made in the form of a serpent. The Chicchans appear to the humans either as gigantic serpents (like on Pier D, House D) or as a hybrid creature "having the upper part of the body in human shape but the lower half that of a feathered serpent, or he may be a gigantic man appearing like a snake to people ... the female Chicchan, usually called Chicchan of the Great Water, is a mermaid, the upper part of the body that of a woman, the lower half that of a fish" (ibid.: 264).5 The two most important emblems of the thunderer are the serpent and the ax. The best rendition of the serpent/ax pair can be seen on the Dumbarton Oaks tablet, where the dancing king brandishes a looped serpent enclosing a celt (fig. 11g). The scene, which is attended by the king's father and mother, could very possibly represent another snake dance; we cannot be sure, however, because portions of the image are missing and the context of the tablet is completely unknown. Robicsek (1978: fig. 3) has published a detail of a polychrome vase where one can see a scepter made of a snake handle and a smoking ax. A seated figure painted on the wall of the Chacmool temple at Chichen Itza displays the same emblematic pair (Coggins 1988: fig. 7). The interpretation of a half-man, half-serpent creature as a god of lightning is strengthened by non Maya Mesoamerican equivalences, where Tlaloc is handling an undulating staff, interpreted as lightning. At Teotihuacan, a Tlaloc figure painted in frontal view is holding a huge wavy atlatl dart (Tetitla, Corridor 21, Mural 1, in Miller 1973: figs. 248-249). An example from Toltec Chichen Itza has been reproduced by Tozzer 1957: fig. 219) (fig. 12a); there are also several depictions of the Aztec god with the same object in hand (figs. 12b?d). The ?mage closest to our Palenque thunderers is on an unprovenienced serpentine plaque engraved with a standing Tlaloc that has a triple scroll jutting out of his forehead. He holds an undulating serpent (fig. 12c). In N?huatl mythology, Huitzilopochtli killed his sister Coyolxauhqui with the xiuhcoatl, a word translated as "fire serpent" (or lightning) as well as "turquoise serpent." According to the Florentine Codex: "And one named Tochancalqui set fire to the xiuhcoatl. Uitzilopochtli commanded it. Then he pierced Coyolxauhqui and then quickly struck off her head" (Anderson and Dibble 1978-1981, III: 4). The Spanish text is more specific about the nature of the xiuhcoatl: "Una culebra hecha de teas que se llamaba xiuhcoatl, y asi la encendi? y con ella fu? herida la dicha Coyolxauhqui, de que muri? hecha pedazos" (Sahag?n 1956, I: 273).6 Thus the xiuhcoatl is described as a serpent, made of torches that are lit, and that kills. To this representation of lightning we may relate the lighted torch stuck into the forehead of God K, in lieu of the smoking ax (for instance, on Copan Altar W'; Morley 1920: 331). The lighted torch emphasizes lightning, the visual aspect of the phenomenon, whereas the ax is more representative of thunder and thunderbolt. 6. "A serpent made of torches, called xiuhcoatl, and so he lighted it and with it was wounded the one called Coyolxauhqui, from it she died in pieces." name Broken Place suggests the Nahua myth in which a mountain containing the corn needed for human flesh was split open by a thunderbolt." The latter, thought of as an ax blow, probably produced the split or cleft often visible on the head of the Cauac, or earth monsters. The split in the earth that gave birth to mankind may have been otherwise produced. According to the Histoyre du Mechique (1905: 8-9, cited by Nicholson 1971: 400-401), it is an arrow shot from heaven by the sun that produced a cleft in the earth from which emerged a half-man and a half-woman. A stone knife hurled from the heavens was the origin of Chicomoztoc, the seven-mouth cave (Mendieta 1945, I: 83, cited by Nicholson, op. cit.). On the other hand, Clemency Coggins analyzes the creature figuring Stormy Sky's name on Tikal Stela 31 as a personified ax that "emerges from the cleft sky sign which, as lightning, it has split" (1988: 127). 5. Tedlock proposes as a translation of Hurakan (in the Popol Vuh, "Hurakan is the god who causes the rain and flood that end the era of the wooden people") hu(n)rakan, "one-his-leg" (1985: 343). According to Thompson (1950: 56), the glyphic expression IX.765:87, which may be read as bolon-oc-te (nine=bo/on, the day sign oc, and te, which means tree), corresponds to Bolon Yoct?, a god mentioned in the Books of Chilam Balam. Barrera Vasquez and Rend?n (1948: 81) translate the name as "El nueve pata de palo" (in which oc means leg and handle, and te, tree); this interpretation makes more sense than Thompson's translation as "He of Nine (or Many) Strides." In the text on the Structure XIV tablet, bolon-oc-te accompanies twice Gil (A8-A9; E3-F3) and may then be a title or another name for this deity. In the Chilam Balam de Chumayel, Ah Bolon Yocteil (El nueve de la pata de palo) is immediately followed by Ah Buluc Ahau Ti Yoct? Tok (El se?or once pata de palo con pedernal), an even better description of an ax or of our thunderer (see Kelley 1976: 73, 84, 103-105).</page><page sequence="11">Baudez: The Maya snake dance 47 3 I hope to have convinced the reader that the figure presented by the woman to Chan Bahlum on the tablet of Structure XIV is an image of lightning and/or of a lightning maker. When the Palenque king handles the thunderer in a fertility ritual, he is the impersonator of the rain god and the one who "beats the water out of the clouds." In other contexts, the thunderer in staff or scepter form may be a mere symbol of power, like the thunderbolt held by Pallas Athene. The two heads of the serpent-bar, the most common symbol of rulership, often open on thunderer figures. They strengthen the power of the bar, an ?mage of the sky. When the king dies, he is deified and becomes himself a thunderer: the late Pacal, as depicted on the lid of his sarcophagus, has a celt going through his skull (fig. 11f). I have mentioned above that the thunderer may have had several aspects. The Popol Vuh names three entities: Hurricane, Newborn (or Youngest?) Thunderbolt, and Raw (or New?) Thunderbolt (respectively, hurakan, 4hipa caculha, and raxa caculha; Tedlock 1985: 343). Gil, a probable patron god of Palenque, is represented as a baby in the iconography of the piers of the Temple of the Inscriptions (Greene Robertson 1983: 36-40), as well as in the Palenque texts, where he is shown in a reclining position and with the proportions of a baby (T1030f, 1030g). He may then be a supernatural analog to the Quiche deity "Newborn (or Youngest) Thunderbolt." Whatever the derivations the thunderer may have had in religious as well as in political iconography, the little god on the Structure XIV tablet appears as a rainmaking deity because of his surroundings: a dance on the underworld waters. The ritual depicted is then concerned with rainmaking, plant growth, and fertility. I suggest that the same interpretation also applies to the snake dance illustrated on House D. There, on Pier D, the king is holding the serpent with his left hand and an ax with his right. On the Structure XIV tablet, he dances empty-handed but is about to grab the creature who is at the same time serpent and ax. It remains to be seen whether comparable rituals exist nowadays and whether their interpretation confirm our hypotheses. Figure 12.

Drawing: Claude Baudez.</page><page sequence="12">48 RES 21 SPRING 1992 The snake dance in Mesoamerica today In some Mesoamerican Indian dances today, a woman and (a) serpent(s) play essential parts. One is the ba/7e c?e la Culebra, also called Patz?j (that is, el doblar del mais) among the Quiche,of Highland Guatemala. In addition to the male dancers called gracejos (clowns) who wear dark-colored masks? probably to recall their underworld origins?there is one dancer who plays a female role, and one or several live snakes (Termer 1928). The dance is composed of three parts: a sexual episode during which the dancers in turn mimic the abduction and possession of the woman; then the actual snake dance, when the reptiles are manipulated and put into the dancers' shirts. Termer interprets this gesture as an enactment of ingestion, reminding one of the performance of the Mazatecs who, at the Aztec festival of Atamalqualiztli, swallowed snakes and toads (Anderson and Dibble 1978-1981, II: 177-178). The last episode of the dance is a pitched battle between the dancers armed with whips, followed by simulated deaths and rebirths. In the variant form from the Momostenango neighborhood, it is the woman who carries the jar that contains the snake and who sets the reptile loose among the dancers. Among the Totonacs of the Sierra de Puebla (Ichon 1969: 353-364), the main actors of the ba/7e de los Tocotines are four captains?who look like kings, judging from their crowns?and the Malinche, a dancer playing a female role who holds a serpent made of wood or cloth. Just as the Palenque ruler threatens his future victim on Pier B, the Totonac dancers move around the two pigs that are destined for sacrifice. The ba/7e de los Negritos, from the same region, has as its main actors (a) Captain Tata Mariano, in charge of the serpent, who takes care of the milpas and the animals; (b) La Malinche or Maringuilla, who is Tata Mariano's wife and the mother of the serpent; and (c) the serpent called kitsis-luwa (five-serpent), who is simultaneously lightning, rain, and maize. There are, besides, one escribano and ten peones, dressed in black (for that reason they are called Negritos). They carry a rattle, as well as a staff or a machete; the Malinche holds an image of the serpent and sometimes a stick. After the dance, the Negritos pretend to kill the snake, but it is Tata Mariano who actually kills it. Because the serpent has previously bitten him, he falls gravely ill and dictates his will to the escribano, but finally gets cured. The modern dances of the Quiche and the Totonacs have in common with the Palenque ritual the involvement of a man (or of men), a woman, a serpent, and a weapon. Sticks, staffs, and whips have replaced the original ax in the ethnographic record. According to Thompson, the Lacandon god of thunder and lightning is called hats' k'u translated as "dios-que-azota-con-el l?tigo" (or the god-who-strikes-with-the-whip; Barrera Vasquez 1980: 185). The woman is the one who presents the serpent or the thunderer to the king, or who brings the snake to the Indian dancers of today. All these dances, either prehistoric or modern, are fertility rites performed for the purpose of bringing about the rains at the right time in order to obtain plentiful crops. We may therefore conclude that the Palenque ritual as well as the Totonac and Quiche dances have a common origin. It is also likely that the Mazatec and Hopi snake dances (where the dancers hold a serpent in their mouths) are related and belong to the same tradition, if one accepts Termer's hypothesis that the Quiche are mimicking the ingestion of the reptile. We may even go further and assume that these rituals? considering their wide distribution?are relics of a Pan Mesoamerican rite. An agrarian ritual at Copan We then assume that the fertility dance played an important part in the Maya official religion of Classic times. One may wonder, therefore, why it is represented only at Palenque. Even if Maya iconography does not offer other such scenes, there are images that refer to the same or to other analogous rituals. Thus the pair formed by Stelae A and H from Copan exhibits the same features as at Palenque House D. The two figures seem to be getting ready to perform the snake dance or some other similar fertility rite (figs. 13, 14). The two monuments face each other at a few meters' distance. Stela A features king Eighteen Rabbit while Stela H represents a woman?or rather a man disguised as a woman, since a loincloth covers the skirt. Be that as it may, the two figures seem to have the same status, because they both hold the serpent bar. Stelae A and H constitute a pair inasmuch as the short text of the latter repeats part of the long text carved on A, including the date 9.14.19.5.0 4 Ahau 18 Muan, which falls exactly 260 days (one tzolkin) before 9.15.0.0.0. Both monuments, dated a.D. 730, are some twenty years later than the reliefs of Palenque House D. On Stela A, the youthful king wears on top of his headdress a human skull on which plants grow (fig. 13). This emblem is reminiscent of the main motif of the water frieze (figs. 3, 6) and may be compared to the personified plants that crown the king on the</page><page sequence="13">Baudez: The Maya snake dance 49 13 14a 14b Figure 13.

Two skeletal serpents flank the skull on Stela A; they hold within their jaws a water lily bud stamped with the caban (earth) sign. The upper part of the headdress on Stela H consists of a maize cob surrounded by bones, another death rebirth image (fig. 14). Several personifications of maize are carved on the stela sides. On the front, the figure displays the xoc-Spondylus mask on her belt. She has a very complete cosmogram on her back that consists of (a) a spread-winged bird (the day sun), perching on (b) a celestial bar with a bird head at each end (an image of the sky), above (c) a skeletal mask with kin on the forehead, crowned with the three-part emblem (the earth as the dwelling place of the night sun). A pseudoloincloth-apron with the usual components of this royal garment hangs from the skeletal mask. Beneath a horizontal mat ornament, the apron proper is decorated with a jaguar mask flanked by serpent frets. A small figure clings to the pseudoapron, partly hiding it. The couple formed by the Copan Stelae A and H is a structural analog to the pair depicted on Pier D of Palenque House D. In both instances, the woman wears the xoc mask on her belt and a cosmogram on her back. On Pier D, it consists of the cosmic tree and</page><page sequence="14">50 RES 21 SPRING 1992 of an earth image as the abode of the night sun. On Copan Stela H, the tree, pillar, or cross is not shown, and the celestial vault on which stands the bird/day sun is carved directly above the mask that represents the earth/night sun. In both cases, the male figure displays an image of plant growth. When couples act in a fertility rite, it is the female figure who wears the cosmogram. At Copan again, three carved monuments (CPN 109, 110, 111) may have been used as individual platforms for the fertility dance. These square blocks (97 cm to the side and 43 cm thick) are carved on their four lateral sides?for every cardinal direction?with a water frieze. An earth monster head with aquatic plants sprouting out of its skull is surrounded with water indicated with horizontal bands and circlets; in addition, there are aquatic and plant emblems (T44, T23, T188; see Baudez 1984, fig. 2b, where CPN 109 is erroneously referred to as CPN 101). These pedestals or dance platforms are not dated; one of them, however, has been reused as a stair step on the east side of Structure 10L-6. Structure 10L-12 was built some forty years after the inauguration of Stelae A/H. I have shown elsewhere that this long platform with a central stairway and high relief sculptures represented a water frieze and was used as a dance platform for agrarian rituals (Baudez 1989). These evidences indicate that the rainmaking ceremony, as it is illustrated at Palenque House D and Structure XIV, was probably performed in a similar way by the Copan ruler and a female dancer.7 However, we have no idea what symbols were handled by the king during the dance. Significance of the ritual Most of our information comes from House D, where the ceremony is detailed in a sequence of events. Before dancing, the king presents to his partner the xoc Spondylus mask, a female emblem. In so doing, the ruler confers the female sex on the recipient. He also receives from the king's hands the cosmogram that he will soon carry on his back. When the king hands over the insignia to his partner, he divides himself in two; he "creates" a woman to whom he confers a cosmic dimension. The creation of a woman is a requisite for the mimicked sexual union, an essential component of the rite whose purpose is to improve the earth's fertility and ensure plentiful crops. The woman reciprocates in offering to the king the serpent or the thunderer. Both symbols represent, as in the dance of the Negritos, the lightning and the rain that impregnates the earth, just as the man impregnates the woman. Among the ancient Maya, the sexual act and the rainmaking dance were probably followed by a death-and-rebirth episode that we may imagine on the now-worn-off Pier E. Violence and sacrifice were indissolubly linked, as shown by the House D sequence, whose first and last scenes depict two moments of the sacrificial rite. In summary, the ritual included three essential components: (1) a sexual union between the king and a "woman" probably representing the mother earth; (2) a dance during which the king impersonated the god of lightning and rain; and (3) sacrificial and violence rites that were taking place in a death-rebirth cycle.

One of the murals recently discovered at Cacaxtla (Czitrom 1989) depicts a man and a woman dancing on a water frieze. This image of the watery underworld is divided into triangular panels by a broken line, like the frieze on Pier D, House D. The male figure is the best preserved of the two. The large rings he wears around the eyes are reminiscent of those of Tlaloc, while the long scorpion tail that dangles between his legs is identical to the attribute of the Chac figure on page 31a of the Madrid codex. This mural, although found outside the Maya area, is very Mayan in style and iconography. It provides another example of a rainmaking ritual performed on the underworld waters by a dancing couple who impersonate thunder and rain deities.</page><page sequence="15">Baudez: The Maya snake dance 51 REFERENCES Acosta, Jorge R. 1977 "Excavations at Palenque, 1967-1973," in Social Process in Maya Prehistory, ed.
