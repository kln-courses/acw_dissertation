<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CATEGORICAL STRUCTURE OF POPPER'S METAPHYSICS Karl Popper's approach to philosophy is platonic: philosophy for him is an exploratory, self-critical, hesitant, and skeptical kind of inquiry. An Aristotelian approach to philosophy, on the other hand, proceeds in a more formal and systematic manner. It is an attempt to characterize the basic categories of a view of the world with the aim of exhibiting structural and organic wholeness. In this article, my aim is to exhibit Popper's metaphysics as an organic whole and thus to place his philosophical explorations into a systematically arranged structural complex. By solidifying Popper's tentative explorations into a basic set of categories, one may then proceed to improve on his system by adding further insights, modification's, and subtleties not found in the original version. To put this another way, armed with the formal structure to be outlined here, one may set out on an adven- turous, platonistic, venture of one's own. This is one of the ways in which we may progress in philosophy, namely by building on the foundations of another philosophy. I. Popper's Logic of Inquiry To speak of Popper's logic of inquiry is to speak of how he defines the logic of discourse of metaphysics, of what he regards as the basic metaphysical question, and of what we can hope to achieve from such an inquiry. When Popper began his career in philosophy, he was, as he ad- mits, heavily influenced by Kant (S967).1 Like Kant, Popper enthroned epistemology, defined not as the study of thought-processes but as the study of the conditions under which we may know, as the pri- mary philosophical discipline; metaphysics he regarded as important but cognitively ambiguous (or as he later puts it, irrefutable). From the start, however, Popper was a metaphysical realist (S963). That is, he held that epistemology is an activity carried out by real people of real cognitive processes and real contents in a real world (S123). In recent years, Popper has turned to an examination of this world: 1 All references to Popper will be given in the body of the text as follows: (CR....) refers to Karl Popper, Conjectures and Refutations.

La Salle: Open Court, 1974. 82</page><page sequence="2">THE CATEGORICAL STRUCTURE OF POPPER'S METAPHYSICS 83 from epistemology (or the logic of inquiry) he has turned to an exam- ination of the nature and the structures of the world in which our cognitive processes, and particularly their objective, logical, content have a place. Where he previously saw philosophy as the activity of criticizing antecedent philosophies, he now sees philosophy as in addition, the construction of world-views (K153). For Popper, metaphysics has the same cognitive aim as does science: it involves the presentation and criticism on conjectures about reality (S980). We attempt through both to "catch the real world" (S46) in our conceptual nets. Science differs from metaphysics in that, whereas metaphysical conjectures are irrefutable, scientific conjectures are refutable. To catch the real world in a metaphysical scheme, we must investigate not only the character of the world but also the nature of the modes of being in that world. In addition, not only must we attempt to delineate the traits of the modes of being, but metaphysics must also deal with the togetherness of the modes of being. Metaphysics is thus not only ontology, it is also cosmology. In the Sophist (343d), Plato holds that the highest metaphysical question is: 'What is being?' (cf. 100c). In his turn, Aristotle defines metaphysics as the study of the highest being, as a study of the theory of principles, and as the study of beings (Meta. III, 4, 1001, a3). For reasons we shall shortly outline, Popper rejects Plato's formulation of the highest metaphysical question. In addition, he rejects the first two of Aristotle's questions, and would, I believe, hold that meta- physics is the study of the modes of being and of their togetherness. Popper would, therefore, hold that the basic metaphysical question is: "There are beings; how are they together?" This question may be distinguished from other formulations of the basic ontological question. There are three basic ontological ques- tions that may be posed; two of these Popper rejects. One of the three questions is what Popper takes to be the basic Aristotelian (but really also Platonic) question: What is being? The other is the typical conventionalist questions: How is being (for me, for us) ?2 If we take the basic ontological question to be, "What is being?" (as the Essentialists do), we assume, Popper has argued at length, that it is possible for us to achieve ultimately conclusive, incorrigible, knowledge of being or beings (CR, 104). In other words, the essential- ist question presupposes an identification of being and knowing. Ac-' 2This formulation of the conventionalist question includes within it the psychol- -ogistic and sociologistic variants of it.</page><page sequence="3">84 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH cording to such a view, it is possible to arrive at a definitive analysis of the nature of being. But essentialism is false because the world is not univocally explainable. For the conventionalist, on the other hand, being and knowing are held to be radically disjunctive. That is, the conventionalist holds that it is impossible to know what is, to know being, because being has meaning (and existence) only in appear- ances, or, in a different formulation, being is its appearances. Thus the conventionalist approach to metaphysics breaks down into two nominally dissimilar but conceptually identical questions: How does being appear to me, to us? -and, What is being for me, for us? For the conventionalist, then, being is regarded as completely plastic and amenable to any explanation whatsoever, explanations differing from person to person. According to either formulation, we construct ex- planatory theories of the world, theories which may have only 'prag- matic' value since being or reality is infinitely malleable, and we have not only no way of knowing whether or not our theories are true, but the question of their truth or falsity is unintelligible. Popper's position on the basic ontological question is, taking a cue from Agassi (S693), a modified synthesis of both false views. With the conventionalist Popper agrees that we invent our explana- tory theories. But with the essentialist, Popper agrees that our aim is to discover true theories which explain a real world behind the appearances. We thus aim to achieve truth, but we do so by tentative approximations (S694). That is, reality is objective and independent of individual preference. So even though we invent theories about reality, we cannot coerce reality into being as we think it (S1093). Having isolated the basic ontological question for Popper, we can further distinguish three subspecies of the question. Popper claims, first of all, that there are "many sorts of real things," and "many sorts of reality," (K37). The intelligibility of these claims lies on two assumptions: (1) being must be taken, as Plato took it, to be enumerable, to be many; that is, there must be several senses of the term "to be," and thus several modes of being, And secondly, there must be present in the mind, to put it loosely, different intellectual activities or capacities such that identification of these modes can take place. The first point has already been touched on: where being is held to be not enumerable, we identify being with Being, and meta- physics becomes theology or an inquiry into the (highest) One being. The second point is ingredient to the entire process of thinking, name- ly the distinction between different mental faculties or abilities. On</page><page sequence="4">THE CATEGORICAL STRUCTURE OF POPPER'S METAPHYSICS 85 the basis of these two conditions, we can say that the first task of ontological analysis is the identification of the components of the world. Thus Popper identifies physical things (of world one) which may be grasped sensually, and the mental things of the world three which may be grasped through a sort of 'mental' seeing. (I leave this point undeveloped since I think it fruitless to question Popper's views of our cognitive capacities.) The first task of ontological analysis is then identification. But that is not enough. For not only do we need to identify things as existing, we also need to determine the nature of existing things. Thus Popper claims that one of the main tasks of philosophy is to recognize and locate many things, none more real than others (K38). Location presupposes prior identification: it is the task of determining the group or class or mode of being of which an identified thing is an instance. Whereas in the case of identification we can indicate tables and chairs and minds and ideas and processes and regularities and theories and so on, in the second when we locate a thing within its class, we demarcate the different sorts of things from each other. We know that for Popper there are three basic classes of things, three modes of being which he calls the physical things of world one, the mental processes of world two, and the mental contents of world three. We demarcate these not only in terms of mental powers, but in terms of the manner in which we manipulate by reactive response, mental things by feeling, and mental contents by logical properties. The three classes of things may be termed physiological, psycho- logical, and logical things; or actualities, existents, and possibilities. Having identifed and located things is still not enough. We need to add synthetic or relational analysis. The third task of those who would investigate things ontologically in a Popperian manner is to determine the relations between things within their classes, and the relations between classes of things (K155). Thus Popper claims that worlds one and two, and worlds two and three interact, while worlds one and three do not interact directly. Or, in different language, phy- siological things interact with psychological things, and psychological things interact with logical things, but physiological and logical things do not interact. The modes and relations of being are thus determined not by one but by several intellectual activities that we may term: identification, modal determination, and correlation. These three intellectual acts define the modes of being and the modes of reasoning about being</page><page sequence="5">86 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH (cf. S1060). There are, then, three directions of inquiry in ontology, although all three directions may be involved in any single ontological analysis. There are thus three different senses of "to be": to be a thing, a thought, and a relation.3 To claim that the tasks of metaphysics involve the identification and correlation of modes of being is to realize that we cannot say much about reality itself (S1057). Reality is, for Popper, forever be- yond our grasp. The most we can do is propose conjectures about reality which may 'approximate' but not reach its real nature (K80). Like Plato, Popper accepts the view of the rational inaccessibility of the whole, and like Plato, he would appear, as we shall see at the end of this examination, to rely on certain mythological surrogates for the completion of his view of reality. II. Modes and Realms of being By a mode of being I shall mean essentially what Popper means by 'world,' that is, "a framework of limited constancy" (S134). Just as Popper identifies three worlds, or three subworlds of 'the' world, so I identify three modes of being in his thought. Were we to deal solely with the modes of being (with the three worlds), we would end up with incoherence'since it seems that the modes of being are ab- stractions from some more fundamental cosmology which involves the relatedness of the worlds. To put this another way, to deal with the modes of being alone and independently of their interactions would mean the neglect of what I shall call ontological "traits" which result from the interplay of the modes with each other. So even though the modes of being are analytically distinguishable from their interrelations, the coherence of Popper's metaphysics requires that we see cosmology, or the relatedness of beings, as primary, and onto- logical identification and modal determination as secondary. This is supported, in part, by Popper's claim that the basis of realism is the 'belief' in regularities and propensities (S120), and although we may discover some of these regularities, some will never be found (S1094). For Popper, there are three worlds: world one, world two, and world three. The very notion of world suggests that Popper is speak- ing of three orders of being, three frameworks, three types of entity. Were this the sum of metaphysics, Popper's metaphysics would entail an incoherent cosmology for the unity required of a cosmos would be lacking. Furthermore, the ontology itself would be incoherent since 3 I have developed the triadic structure of Popper's metaphysics, and subjected it to criticism in, "Does Popper Need a Fourth World?"</page><page sequence="6">THE CATEGORICAL STRUCTURE OF POPPER'S METAPHYSICS 87 there are 'traits' of reality or of 'the' world, such as the nature of persons, which can only be understood in terms of the interaction of the worlds with each other. So we must see the primacy of cos- mology to ontology, of relatedness to discrimination in Popper's meta- physics. Popper characterizes his three worlds as follows. World one is, inter alia, the world of matter and energy; it is the material world of both inorganic and organic beings considered in their physical nature. World two is the world of subjective conscious experience. World three is the objective world of the logical contents of subjective thought-processes. These three modes of being do not seem to me to exhaust the world. There are certain traits of being which result from the interaction of the worlds with each other. Thus, for instance, Pop- per characterizes 'personhood' as the result of the interaction of worlds two and three. Hence the realm of persons and the realm of culture (a product of persons) is not a mode of being, but a trait of being. If the distinction between a mode and a trait of being is accepted, we may distinguish three modes of being and two traits of being in Popper's metaphysics. This results in five categorical complexes as fields of study: the mode of being of world one, the realm of being resulting from the interaction of worlds one and two, the mode of being of world two, the realm of being resulting from the interaction of worlds two and three, and the mode of being of world three. The investigation below will follow this order of investigation. III. The being of World one. Popper is a nonphysicalistic or nonmaterialistic naturalist. Unlike the physicalists, he does not hold that being is reducible to one mode of being, the being of matter. On the other hand, he does hold that the three modes of being emerge from the physical world. Hence the phy- sical world must be regarded as the temporal and causal, albeit un- determined, condition of the other worlds. It must be noted, however, that the claim that world one is the physical world is itself a meta- physical or ontological claim: it is an interpretation of the nature of Nature. I propose, therefore; to accept Popper's claim that world one is the world of matter as a' provisional hypothesis only. And Popper himself holds that matter may not be the only physical reality (S1129). It would perhaps be better to regard the world in its pri- mordial form as Nature, and leave it at that. Let me explain. As is well known, attempts to characterize "Nature" throughout</page><page sequence="7">88 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH philosophical history have been diverse and inconclusive. The char- acter of nature seems extremely varied and manifold. Yet at the same time, the study of nature seems to be the foundation for any study of being or of the modes of being. Nature may be said to serve as the matrix and source of all the modes and realms of being; it is the inexhaustible receptacle out of which things, beings, emerge, without itself being emergent from anything else. It is thus simply there, given. Nature may thus be regarded as the primordial fund of onto- logical inquiry, while being itself beyond such inquiry. It is the name given to the preconceptual, preexperiential "all" or "whole" that we attempt to characterize in ontological inquiry. Whether this "nature" is subsequently explained in realistic or idealistic, naturalistic or spiritualistic terms is another matter altogether: it itself is beyond such characterizations, is the ground for characterization. Popper does not explicitly make such a point, but I believe it can be inferred from some of his comments. He says, for instance, that there is a cosmos of regularities "in" Nature (S14). This, he claims, is the basis for the realist's faith. A realist believes that there are real propensities and regularities in Nature (S123). Nevertheless, he adds, the incom- pleteness of our theories of or about reality (which he uses inter- changeably with 'nature') may be, he says, a "reflection of the in- determinateness of reality," (S124) and further, there may well be "exceptionless intrinsic regularities of nature" which are too deep ever to be discovered (S1094). This gives us our clue. Popper does not claim that Nature "is" regularity; regularities are in and of nature. This suggests that the faith in or discovery of propensities and re- gularities is the result of thinking about Nature, is not nature itself. Nature may thus have characteristic regularities and propensities, but what Nature is in and of itself is beyond human comprehension, is inexhaustible. This is the sense in which I consider Popper a natur- alist. The mode of being which Popper identifies as world one is the world of physical being. A mode of being is an 'order' of Nature, but is not itself Nature. To identify an 'order' in Nature is to identify cer- tain regularities in Nature. We can thus ask: What are the general categories of being in world one? or, in categorical language: What, in the order of generality, are the categories of physical being? Since Popper speaks of 'levels' of reality, but not of 'degrees' of reality (a platonic notion), he legitimates such a question. Since, however, Pop- per has not yet attempted to systematize his thoughts on this matter, we must of necessity interpret and not simply report on his thought.</page><page sequence="8">THE CATEGORICAL STRUCTURE OF POPPER'S METAPHYSICS 89 What, in the order of generality, are the categories of physical being? This question implies that some orders of physical being may be more general than others. So we must first ask, What is the most general and pervasive order or regularity in Nature? What is the most general order in terms of which all physical processes have a place or location? It would seem clear that we can think (and thus speak) of no process, and of no things in process, without the aid of the funda- mental matrix of things or processes, that is, multiplicity, or the re- gularity of space-time, or time-space. The most general and pervasive order in Nature, the most general regularity, would thus seem to be the space-time continuum, or the spatiotemporal universe (S1141). It is this 'universe' that enables us to speak of motion, of measure- ment, of things, of processes. I doubt that Popper would attempt to characterize the 'being' of this continuum: it is simply the metaphor- ical field or order of all orders and fields. It is the matrix of all orien- tation and interpretation. Like Nature itself, space-time is simply there; it is the organizational regularity from which we may begin. The space-time field may be regarded as the primary projection of the universe, a basic framework which is not itself a framework, in terms of which we may arrange the furniture of the universe. Thus Popper speaks of the 'reality' of time and change as keys to realism (S103), and the reality of change depends on space-time. According to the discoveries of the investigators of the 'physical' world, there are certain constants or presences to be found within the space-time continuum. These constants are less regular than, not coextensive with, that continuum. Some of these constants may be peculiarities of human beings only. That is, they may be simply the most general facets of human experience. I am thinking here of such constants as heat and sound. On the other hand, there are some con- stants which are not so limited. I am thinking of the electromagnetic field, or the field of forces (S1129) which Popper conjectures is as real as matter. Thus Popper speaks of the universal "laws" of light and motion (S108). This electromagnetic field of forces may thus be considered as the second order of generality in physical being. The next order of generality would seem to be physical things such as x-rays and crystals (K144). I am not sure whether or not the order or regularity of physical things is of lesser generality than the electromagnetic field, or whether the order of things is one of several orders of which the electromagnetic field is another, which are on the same level of generality. Nonetheless, it would appear that</page><page sequence="9">90 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH physical things, which may be identified as enduring entities, entities with 'careers,' is a third order of generality in physical being. To have a career is to be able to come into and go out of being. Thus electrons and other subatomic particles, as well' as macroobjects such as galaxies and stars must be included in this order of physical being. It is part of Popper's faith as a realist to believe that not only human beings have careers or endure. In his discussion of the 'arrow of time' he argues against the subjectivists that time-direction is not simply an anthropological or anthropomorphic conception, and that it is not true that objectively the universe is simply a Parmenidean block universe (S102,1141). Rather, the direction of time is objectively real. So we may legitimately speak of the careers of stars and other entities (S106). This is, I think, an important claim. For if it is the case that not only human beings have directions (or purposes), then the phy- sical world is not and cannot be conceived in the Sartrean fashion as a purposeless and alien reality onto which human beings may im- pose purposive structures and arrangements. Rather, there are direc- tions in physical reality, and human beings must at some point bend their ears, and their wills, to physical requirements. Certainly, Popper would not go so far as Charles Hartshorne does in claiming that all physical realities are alive and actively purposive-in the direction of vitalicm, but he does not accept the typical existentialist spasm of an absurd physical world, either. IV. The Realm of life, Values, and Learning Even though Popper identifies world one as inclusive of organic as well as inorganic physical structures, the identification and modal determination are, to say the least, problematic. Popper identifies world two, the world of subjective consciousness, as emergent from world one. That is, the regularities involved in the world of subjective consciousness have different categorical features than do the regular- ities of world one. In world two are to be found the experiences of vision, audition, memory, imagination, thought, and what Popper calls "dispositional intentions." These are the characteristics of con- scious human beings. Yet Popper does not deny that animals and other organic beings have some or even all of these conscious experi- ences: "I think animals are conscious." (S151). The most that he denies is that animals have selves, for the origin of self is a "feedback function of theory making," (S151) and since theory making is a function of the third world, the self is the result of the interaction</page><page sequence="10">THE CATEGORICAL STRUCTURE OF POPPER'S METAPHYSICS 91 of worlds two and three (S156). Hence world two may be regarded as the world of preegoistic beings which are conscious. If this is so, then Popper would have to include animals, and perhaps all living things with any propensity for learning within the purview of the second world, for he defines life as consisting in physical structures which are problem solving (S143). Yet from other statements we gather that the second world is the world of "human" conscious experience. Thus he claims that we must distinguish consciousness per se from organized human consciousness of world two (S151). So it seems reasonable to conclude that life is a categorical order not strictly within world one, and not entirely within world two, but the result of the interaction of these two worlds. These are some of the reasons why I propose to demarcate the categorical orders of life, values, and learning from the categorical orders which apply strictly to world one. As we have seen, Popper identifies life as consisting in physical structures with the capacity for problem-solving. Coincident with the emergence of life is the emergence of values (S155). Hence we can say that life, values, and problem solving (ok. learning) coincide in their origin (S142). A value may be defined as a capacity to be attracted to or repulsed by some object or situation. We need not, however, be conscious of values, for "there is life without conscious- ness," and thus values without consciousness (S155). A problem, on the other hand, presupposes that there is a distinction between a propensity to do something and the capacity to modify that propen- sity in light of negative results (S106). But again, this modificational capacity need not be a conscious one (S143). Practical problems arise because of some unexpected event, and adjustment requires some preconscious theory-making (S106). This would suggest that for Popper a simple one-celled creature such as an amoeba is theoretical. And Popper supplies us with support for this view when he claims that the only difference between an Einstein and an amoeba is that Einstein can formulate his response to problems (K25, 261). This means that there is an inborn hypothesizing tendency in all living things (K24). What differentiates Einstein from the amoeba, then, is not that Einstein occupies the second world while the amoeba occu- pies the first world, but that Einstein can, whereas the amoeba can- not, objectify his ideas (K161). It follows, then, that Einstein is Ein- stein because of the third and not simply the second world. Elsewhere I have shown that Popper is systematically ambiguous</page><page sequence="11">92 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH in differentiating his worlds from each other. Here I propose simply to arbitrarily differentiate prehuman from human consciousness with- in world two. With this stipulation, we can proceed to distinguish the origin of life, values, and learning, as a realm of being not wholly in world one nor wholly in world two. This realm of being may be char- acterized as the realm of prehuman learning: on the basis of interests (values), expectations, regularities, and laws (S40), prehuman con- sciousness grows and develops right up to the threshold of human consciousness. V. The Being of World Two: Human Consciousness The world of human consciousness emerges from the realm of life with the emergence of the power of speech (S1112), and specific- ally the story-telling function of language (S151). Popper admits that animals other than human beings may have a language; bees, for instance, seem able to communicate and pass on information (S1112). Human language, on the other hand, involves the development of the descriptive and argumentative functions of language, that is, the abil- ity to distinguish and assert the difference between true and false descriptions (S1112-13). Yet this ability to distinguish truth from falsity is a function of the third world (itself emergent from world two). Hence the argumentative function of language may be coinci- dent with the origin of the third and not the second world. That is, the shift from emphasis on the present to the use of symbols, and thus the ability to "look ahead" demarcates the human from the prehuman use of language. The world of human consciousness is the world of "subjective" knowledge. Of course, since not only human beings have subjective knowledge there must be certain categorical traits which distinguish human subjective consciousness from nonhuman varieties. The cate- gorical traits of human subjective consciousness may be taken as the demarcating criteria of the second world. The realm of being of persons and culture is the result of the interaction of worlds two and three (S156). It thus appears that per- sons are made and not born, and that culture is a fabrication or pro- duction and not an event. Thus culture and the realm of persons will have categorical traits different from the simple world of human consciousness. Culture and the realm of persons arise in the process of organizing and criticizing and, self-consciously modifying subjec- tive knowledge. That is, persons as distinct from nonpersons have self-conscious and thus methodical procedures for adding to their</page><page sequence="12">THE CATEGORICAL STRUCTURE OF POPPER'S METAPHYSICS 93 knowledge (S1123). The world of subjective knowledge can thus be circumscribed as the world of human conscious experience prior to the active search for and criticism of knowledge. There are, it seems to me, three basic conditions that must be met before we can enter the realm of persons; these conditions constitute the categorical traits of world two. These three traits are those of habitual propen- sities or dispositions, memory, and a low-level descriptive language (cf. S1054). As Popper has argued at great length, without the presence of traditions in social life, there would be chaos (S1170). Hence at any one time we are the products of our past traditions (S1168). Where tradition is a term appropriate to organized communal existence, its counterpart in individual life is 'disposition' or habit. Just as tradi- tions are institutional organizatons of interests, so dispositions are subjective organizations of interests. And just as without traditions there is social chaos, so without dispositions there is personal chaos. Habits of action may be regarded as dispositions which develop from the solution of problems which have become automatic (S153). They are thus modifiable modes of behavior. Through the development of 'habits' our interests take shape and become regularized. One of the conditions for the development of personhood is the ability, conscious or not, to regularize our dispositions, to channel them into various routines. Had each of us at every moment, and all of us at some moment, to respond to conditions in always novel ways, as some of our recent addicts of the moment have argued, there we could find only that pathetic tendency to love novelty for novelty's sake. And as Popper has noted, this would result in each and every person having to discover anew for himself what others have learnt, and this would mean that no progress, no growth could be envisioned in life. A second categorical trait of the subjective world of world two is that of memory. Memory is the awareness of the past as past, of the present as present, and of the possibility of recalling past experiences which may be useful in the present. Memory thus presupposes a dis- tinction between past and present, and thus presupposes an organiza- tion of experiences into these two categories. A third categorical trait of world two is descriptive language. Classification and categorization are based on the recognition of items which evoke expectation or interests beyond the present mo- ment. Thus language requires memory and organized dispositions, or at any rate they are ingredient to it.</page><page sequence="13">94 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH These three, dispositions, memory, and descriptive language are the components of the common-sense world: they are the conditions for our escape from the state of nature into the state of 'art,' into the genuinely human world. On their basis, we learn from our mistakes, we can produce things, and we begin to create a communal existence. VI. The Realm of Persons and Culture Persons are made, not born. Persons are made by the interaction of world two with world three. Through the interaction of these two worlds, persons come into existence and can grow (S156). A person is not simply a subjective self, but an interpersonal existent. A person is not simply 'subject' but also 'object' for another, has not only personal and subjective opinions, but also has objectively testable ideas and theories. The realm of persons is thus the result of the inter- action of subjectivity with objectivity, individuality with communal- ity. The world of persons is the human world as specifically distin- guished from the animal world. It is the realm of being which is the specific condition for the emergence of all the 'higher' functions and powers of life, and specifically the power to create. As in previous cases, here too we find three categorical traits of the realm of persons and culture. These are history, interpersonal cooperation, and the arts and sciences. The realization that we are historical beings, or the invention of history as a mode of being in the world, is contingent upon two basic factors: (1) a common fund of past experiences embodied in disposi- tions and memories, and (2) an anticipation of future experience. Where memory involves a distinction between past and present, his- tory requires a distinction between these two and the future-which, as Popper states emphatically, is not necessarily like the past. With- out a common fund of dispositional habits and memories, we would live simply in the present (S12). The development of dispositional habits and memories, and following that the development of tradi- tions and other forms of shared experience, give rise to one of the aspects of history. That is, we come to realize that we endure, that we grow and change. Time thus becomes a dominant factor of life. Yet traditions and shared experiences do not alone make us historical beings. A genuine sense of history develops when we realize that the future need not be like the past, that we are not necessarily stuck with the 'has been,' but that we can adventure forth into the unknown future. We learn, in other words, that we can modify and change our</page><page sequence="14">THE CATEGORICAL STRUCTURE OF POPPER'S METAPHYSICS 95 traditions and habits, that we can criticize them. Thus imagination plays a role in the historical consciousness. And consequently, we need the third world to understand history (K297). A second trait of personal and cultural being is interpersonal cooperation. The ability to consider and to criticize our traditions and thus modify them is the result of the development of world three, and specifically the development of the argumentative function of lan- guage (S113). And with the aid of the argumentative function of lan- guage, we discover systematic means to negate false and unreliable or unfruitful traditions (S153). It- is obvious that the simple description of the world can be carried out by any individual alone. If truth or falsity of descriptions is a concern, interpersonal argument and criti- cism must develop. Hence truth and falsity may be regarded as con- ceptions which arise out of and presuppose interpersonal (or inter- subjective) cooperation. A third trait of personal being is the development of the arts and the sciences regarded as organized institutional practices. The power to rest from one's labors, is a subjective power. On the other hand, the power to consciously direct one's powers of concentration on some problem, to thematize one's conscious powers, is a personal and not simply a natural capacity. And it is only insofar as we are organ- ized and communal beings that we can engage in concentration or specialization of consciousness. And without, such concentration, the organized disciplines of the sciences and the arts could not and would not develop (S153). VII. The Being of World Three World three is described in many ways by Popper.4 It is, he tells us, the world of the "objective contents of thought" (K106). It is thus what one could call the world of formal being. This world is, like the other world, a product of evolution, an emergent world. Its specific producer is a human being (K112). It is, however, a world which is autonomous of its human producers (Kill). The objects of the third world, its formal contents, are objective and real. Unlike the objects of the other two worlds, the objects of the third world are in- telligibles, possibilities, virtualities (K106). The mode of being of this formal world is rich, manifold, and infinite. It is the realm of theory, 4 For an extensive consideration of Popper's notion of a third world, see my "Popper's Ontology: An Exposition and Critique," Southern Journal of Philosophy, Spring, 1975.</page><page sequence="15">96 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH of objective mentality, of discourse, and of the growth of knowledge. Without language, this world could not be either explored or known. There are three basic categorical traits of formal being which can be distinguished amidst the plethora of remarks Popper makes about this world. These are the categories of rationality and objec- tivity, of the infinity of theories and their consequences, and of possi- bility. The world of formal being is, first of all, the world of rationality or objectivity. Rationality in thought and in practice is contingent on the possibility of criticizing our ideas (K107,108). We can criticize our ideas and theories only if we can distinguish the thought or assertion of a theory from the logical content of a thought or assertion (K157). In other words, criticism, and hence rationality, is contingent upon our being able to distinguish thought-process from thought, asserting from assertion; and in addition, in being able to realize that while thought-process and asserting are subjective, thought and assertion are objective. Secondly, formal being has the trait of infinity. The most basic trait of ideas and theories is that they exist not alone, but together. Ideas, and statements thus have logical relationships to each other; they entail, and imply each other. But the extent of the implications and entailments of theories is infinite. It is impossible for us even to understand or grasp or consider all the consequences of a statement or theory. We thus cannot know the contents of this third world fully. It follows that while our knowledge of the third world is finite, our ignorance of it is infinite (K159-60, 28). Thus even though we aim to know the world, aim to achieve truth, this aim is regulative only and never constitutive. It is always possible for us to improve on our knowledge, to come closer to truth. But we can never attain truth, and the "number of possibly true theories remains infinite . . ." (K15) This infinite trait of the world of formal being precludes our ever being able to achieve conclusive truth: our theories are always presented from within the world, never from without. We are thus caught within an ever changing horizon of possibil- ities of all kinds. This formal world contains within it many hidden possibilities (K116), among which are technological possibilities (K 153), new aims and values (K149), and even possibilities that can never be materialized or actualized in any way. VIII. The Worlds Together. "Nature," I suggested at the start, is ontologically ultimate. It</page><page sequence="16">THE CATEGORICAL STRUCTURE OF POPPER'S METAPHYSICS 97 neither explains anything nor is itself explainable. "The" world with its three subworlds is simply the name for the togetherness of the modes of being. Thus "world" is analogous on the conceptual level to "Nature" on the preconceptual level, with the difference that while Nature is the fund of all thought, "world" is the result of thought. For Popper, unlike the idealistic and some existentialistic ontologists, the questions of why the "world" is as it is, and why the world exists at all rather than not, is just simply a question that cannot be asked (S1127), or better, since every "why?" question may be followed by another ad infinitum (S104),- there is no ultimate or final answer. All construction takes place within Nature, or within a world. Certainly the world itself, or the three subworlds of the world are "together," form a cosmos, but their togetherness is not a being over and above them together. There is thus no final world system, no final account of being, and that is just the way things are. We cannot achieve ulti- mate explanations. The world is thus an open, free, growing, and in- determinate system (S150, 1057). Within the "world" there are the three worlds, or modes of being, of physical reality, consciousness, and structure. Popper thus recog- nizes the traditional arrangement of nature, consciousness, and mind (S147). One question we must ask of this arrangement concerns the arrangement itself. Human beings have traditionally been arranged in a hierarchy of matter, life, soul, and spirit. It may thus appear as if Popper's metaphysics (i.e., his ontology and cosmology) is simply a generalized account of human being, and is thus a generalized meta- physical anthropology. Yet we must ask why this biological and an- thropological model seems to be so central for Popper. If I am right in suggesting that "Nature" is the foundation of all our inquiries into being, then is it any more than gross anthropomorphism for a realist to work on the assumption that "Nature" is like human beings? Is the integration of history into the universe legitimate? The claim that physical entities have *careers, move in directions, seems to be a generalization from the human discovery of history. Surely the idea that the universe must evolve and grow and change temporally and otherwise in a way similar to the way human beings do is but an ex- tension of human beings into Nature. But is the frame (or world) of Nature simply a human frame? Does a realist have any basis for holding that ideas (such as world) are important beyond the idiosyn- cratic sphere of human existence and being? Can we think that the</page><page sequence="17">98 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH microscopic realm of human being is paradigmatic for all of "Na- ture's" processes and existents? Popper himself claims that there are many worlds, possible and actual, in which a search for regularities would fail. It is thus invalid to generalize from "our incredibly idiosyncratic region of the uni- verse," (S1027). This biological model of growth as the principle of continuity in Popper is but one of the possible images of the universe. Not only are there other systems, but there is no evidence that there is a system of systems. Nor is there evidence that human perspective is holistic. Metaphysics is a relatively recent discipline, possibly coin- cident with prephilosophical myth-making. In the realm of time, it is a specious present, a relatively negligible activity. Why then not see metaphysics as a human concern and avoid that overweening egoism of a Hegel who would speak of reality from the standpoint of God? Is it too dreary a conclusion that one's philosophies are human, all too human-and leave it at that? If we realize that for Popper "Na- ture" is the inexhaustible and infinite limit of our 'physical' being, just as the third world is the infinite and inexhaustible limit of our mental being, we realize that we are but finite beings caught between two infinities: like Plato's charioteer, driven into two irreconcilable and infinite directions, we are but the all too human constructors of metaphysical systems. Popper distinguishes world from reality. Reality, he tells us, is correspondence with the truth, while truth is correspondence with reality (K319,329). Hence reality and world (or worlds) are radically disjoint. And if this is so, then thinking and reality are disjoint. We can think world, but we cannot think (or know) reality. This is Pop- per's key formulation. If the most that we can do is "hope" in truth with no possibility of attaining truth, then there exists a vast gap between our thought and existence which is "worldly," and reality. But if this is so, then on what basis can Popper lay the foundation for the remarkable ability of thought to think reality? Is it not the case that the intelligibility of our thinking of the world and our hope in knowing reality are ultimately negative and unintelligible? Popper does claim that we should not attempt to explain why we are success- ful in our attempts to explain, for this success is improbable (S1027). But if this is so, then instead of holding to a radical dualism of world and reality, why not simply say: the world is made of nature, sub- jects, and structures and leave it at that-and forget about the tradi- tional ontological argument and its attempt to state reasons why we</page><page sequence="18">THE CATEGORICAL STRUCTURE OF POPPER'S METAPHYSICS 99 "can" know. That is, Popper uses a reverse of the ontological argument to show that we cannot know: he is thus still stuck within the con- fines of the ontological problem. Rather than play this game, Popper should accept the ultimate fact of process without substance, and hold that "to be" is ultimately incomplete process. For otherwise, he cannot avoid that inevitable monistic tendency of all idealisms to be- lieve that the world is ultimately one, an intelligible unity-and this is incompatible with his skepticism. It appears from considerations such as this that Popper's meta- physic vacillates between a sort of metaphysical phenomenalism (where only words and not reality can be known), and an idealistic intuitionism (which appears as the only intelligible basis for the realistic faith). Popper claims that as a realist he believes in real regularities in the world: he believes in a cosmos and not a chaos. Yet his epistemology, and even his cosmology, gives us no reason to believe that there is anything more than a humanized cosmos and an extrahuman chaos. This vacillation between an unintelligible empiri- cism and a supranational intuitionism seems to be the last word of Popper's metaphysics. Popper, like Plato, believes, or seems to believe, in the "One" beyond discoursive grasp, and thus rationally inaccess- ible, to be made intelligible by mythological surrogates such as "real- ism." No one need deny that there is a real world independent of human consciousness and human existence. That in and of itself does not a realist make. There must be some argument, some reason given for holding that this extrahuman reality is relevant to our concerns and needs-otherwise, philosophy remains on the level of "subjective" myth. We are thus faced with a need to go beyond philosophy into theology (which Popper claims is simply the result of a lack of faith- a typical Protestant claim), or else sink into a Cratylean silence. In the final analysis, then, the subjective world of world two takes pre- cedence over the other worlds, for we "believe in order to under- stand." And beyond philosophy which deals with the world, there stands theology or poetry, perhaps, which deals with reality: philo- sophy goes only so far, and beyond that we must take a leap of faith into infinite reality. Popper, it thus appears, is a Kierkegaardian Existentialist malgre lui. DEREK A. KELLY. DENVER, COLORADO.</page></plain_text>
