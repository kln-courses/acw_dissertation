REPORT ON THE 1977 MEETINGS OF THE MLA "Deconstruction" was the watchword at the December meeting of the Modern Lan- guage Association in Chicago. The image was used by Bacon long ago to structure the "pars destruens" and "pars aedificans" of his Novum Organum, but Jacques Derrida has given the term a new, "positive" sense, which was explained at several meetings amid controversy over its interpretation. If M. Derrida was not there to answer for his text, its meaning was nevertheless "the one flower missing" from quite a few bouquets. Effec- tively supplemental was the presence of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, elegant in sari, to controvert J. Hillis Miller's "tamed" view of deconstruction as a useful method in the renewal of literary studies. Authentic de- construction is not a method of interpreting literature, nor the outcome of a literary theory, but a way of life that unifies praxis and theory with the revolutionary intent of changing the world. The positive character, opposed to nihil- ism and skepticism, was disputed in the pro- gram "Criticism as Deconstruction" ar- ranged by the Division of Literary Criticism of the MLA. John Brenkman pointed to the lack in Derridean thinking of a role for his-</page><page sequence="2">NEWS torical reality. Its philosophical terms, he believes, American criticism too often de- grades into figural/rhetorical ones. The ex- emplar is Freud, accommodating the subject to reality by means of fantasy, rather than Marx, who sanctioned utopian fiction be- cause it desires to change reality. Ms. Spivak responded to this charge, and one sensed a common understanding of a problem even though positions may be irreconcilable. The largely younger audience, in which compara- tive literature people were numerous, prob- ably indicates a movement away from strictly professional interests towards more funda- mental concerns. That the results for litera- ture can be good, Barbara Johnson showed in a brilliant vindication of the openness of a Balzac story over Barthes's fetishistic cen- tering of it, in S/Z, on castration and the (missing) phallus. Her version of deconstruc- tion, a "careful teasing out" of signification from the aporias and strife of the text, is perhaps "tamed," but it succeeded in un- leasing Balzac. These two speakers shared a connection with Yale French Studies, reminding one of the preeminence of Yale in American aca- demic criticism since the later forties. So did Geoffrey Hartman, who has been more a rewarding critic than a stylish one, up- holding the Barthesian claim that criticism is rightly a creative mode. Instead of accept- ing the relationship of dependence that makes us all children of the book, the critic spices up his precise task of interpretation by using parafictional devices. He reads the text as a construction of forms, thereby les- sening our dependence on external stimuli; our socialization makes art necessary as revenge upon, not imitation of, nature. The problems of reality "cannot be solved along the axis of equivalence." So Derrida is justi- fied in discussing Hegel on the fragile axis of a pun with aigle. For this reporter the most interesting ses- sion had to be the one on "Literary Theory and the Critical Quarterly in America." There Ralph Cohen presented his idea that literary theory is a genre, carrying out the essential artistic task of self-consciousness through history, reexamination, narration; subject, though, to institutional constraints no less than other genres. Philip Lewis (edi- tor of Diacritics) commented on the extreme lack of rigor in too much academic criticism, yet he excluded theoretical self-consistency as imperialist. The ideal is self-critical criti- cism, where theory and practice coalesce - preferably with a thorough grounding in semiotics to keep one's deconstructions hon- est. The new editor of The Georgia Review, however, found so many current offerings in literary theory self-indulgent, full of un- warranted neologisms, and dull, that he had taken his journal out of the market for that commodity. Comparing the state of the critical art in 1976 (when the MLA first made it a profes- sional field) and 1977 could be depressing, for the previous year's heavy emphasis on reader response criticism seemed almost for- gotten in "the metacritical craze which has swept this convention," as one speaker put it. The absence of Stanley Fish no doubt made a difference. The basis of continued scientific work, however, can hardly be found in "authorless" critical texts whose essential character is creativity of the kind associated with art. There is an inescapable need for argument and rebuttal in a repor- torial language which any professional per- son interested in criticism can master by working at it. Whatever the license of their imitators, Barthes and Derrida use words self-consistently and responsibly, in the French tradition for which Wahl and Hip- polyte, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and Lacan built a bridge to Hegel, Nietzsche, Freud, Husserl, and Heidegger. The only MLA group which has addressed itself directly to this question of a language for discussion, the Society for Critical Exchange, succeeded admirably in setting up a fine topic, "Con- troversy"; unfortunately its three printed papers (though at least one, by N. W. Visser, was highly provocative) failed to stir up a very controversial discussion. Among the more than seven hundred separate sessions were many informative pre- sentations nevertheless, including Jonathan Culler's contribution of an MLA Forum on "Semiotics and Literary Studies." Culler be- gan with Freud's Nachtraglichkeit, a very current concept, and explained how history 386</page><page sequence="3">News organizes its diachronic sequences by invest- ing precursors after the fact with the trauma of a "primal scene" and thus with cause and effect meaningfulness. Similarly, in the sixties "semiology" based on Saussure made events (parole) meaningful by locating them in a paradigm of signification (langue). Culler found a more fundamental base in the semiotics of Peirce, for which the uni- verse consists entirely of signs, socially deter- mined, and hence there can be no percep- tion, only interpretation. In opposition to the anthropomorphic equation by Saphir- Whorf of thought and language, semiotics uncovers the arbitrary nature of all verbal signs and codifies them. This deconstruction is not just a literary method, but rather the opening of fields. Its problem is the relation- ship signification/communication-hence its importance for literary criticism. The cur- rent reader response effort, he contended, is either skewed by a critic's personal theory and reading ability (Fish) or is content with a bathetic accommodation to other egos (Norman Holland). The task, Culler said, is to work out the dialectic of signification and communication at a level in between the most adept and the skilless reader. Using Oedipus Rex, he then showed how a literary text can exemplify Peirce's claim that our tendency to agree on meaning in signs creates external reality. His contribution, not lacking in elegance, was perfectly clear, and nonetheless Nietzschean in its concern for new values and interpretations. By con- trast, the notion that a professor of literature should match the parole indirecte of a Nietz- sche or a Barthes seems rather unnecessary. A healthy new tendency-at least for liter- ary studies - is the inclusion at gatherings of philosophers of a section on theory of litera- ture, such as the workshop chaired by Angel Medina at the last Society of Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy meeting in New York. It worked at clarifying the subjective function (author, reader) within a communi- cative framework. Papers by Alexander Gelley, Patrick Brady, and Christopher Rodie related the criticism of Barthes, Gen- ette, Sartre (on Flaubert), Jauss, Fish, and Miller to the thought of Heidegger, Husserl, Ricoeur, Lacan, and Derrida in a consist- ently helpful way, and the discussion that followed had plenty to work with as a result. GEORGE MCFADDEN Temple University Rolf-Dieter Herrmann, Editorial Consultant of this Journal, American Correspondent of the International Bulletin for Aesthetics, and staunch advocate of international cooperation in aesthetics as well as bridge- building between academic aestheticians and practicing artists, died on March 8, 1978, in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Journal, The American Society for Aesthetics, and the discipline of aesthetics itself are all diminished by his death.  387</page></plain_text>
