<plain_text><page sequence="1">7 +ARCHITECTURE AND HISTORY: VICO, LODOLI, PIRANESI Gian Paolo Consoli In their attempts to understand the fertile yet contradictory artistic and theoretical world of Gio- vambattista Piranesi, scholars have often evoked the names of Giambattista Vico (1668-1744) and Carlo Lodoli (1690-1761). Maurizio Calvesi's 1967 essay consecrated Vico as one of the thinkers with the greatest influence upon Piranesi. The consensus was that Piranesi was indebted to him for his fantastical inspiration, as well as, to some extent, his reappraisal of a mythical Italian past superior to that of the Greeks.' In recent times, there have even been attempts to interpret the Campo Marzio entirely in the light of its relation to Vico's Scienza nuova2 or to suggest that "Vico's ideas seem to have given definitive shape to the forms of Piranesi."3 The Franciscan friar has also become a mandatory reference in Piranesi bibliographies. Despite the architect's direct links with the world of Scalfarotto and Lucchesi in Venice, some scholars consider his polemical writings to represent an attack on Lodolian principles,4 while elsewhere he is considered "Lodoli's most brilliant and most influential disciple."5 These examples represent two extremes ranging from a rather generic approach to an overestimate of the importance of their relationship while generally failing to tackle the argument in a systematic manner or to carry out a careful analysis of the writings in order to establish similarities and differences. Such studies also neglect to give the proper emphasis to the close relationship, which has been amply demonstrated, between the Neapolitan philosopher and the besandaled Venetian friar. The aim of this essay is to try to shed some light on the nature of this genealogy through the similarities of their thought and, above all, of their precocious historicism. By this, I mean the aware- ness that history is not univocal and homogeneous and that neither humanity nor architecture has a single origin (Greece does not, therefore, represent the only source of human civilization). This awareness leads to the desire to reconstruct the story of humankind in all its complexity, focusing in particular upon its origins and using the tool that Vico termed philological science. It also implies the refusal to consider architecture as a merely imitative art, demolishing the myth of the primitive 1 Maurizio Calvesi, introduction to Henri Focillon, Giovanni- Battista Piranesi, ed.

I believe that these ideas are shared, albeit in widely differing forms and fields, by the philosopher as well as by the teacher-friar and the architect. Also frequently neglected are the areas of their thought that divide them, such as the idea of architecture as a science, which is a fundamental postulate of Lodolian thought but far removed from both Piranesi and Vico. My study will commence with a brief look at proven or supposed relations among these three intellectuals, followed by a concise analysis of various interesting aspects of Vico's and Lodoli's thought. This will prepare us for an analysis of Piranesi's main polemical works in light of this genealogy. 1. Biographical Notes It is certain that on 15 January 1728 Carlo Lodoli wrote a letter to Giambattista Vico. This letter was quoted by the Neapolitan philosopher in the 1731 supplement to his autobiography: "Your profound work, the Principi di una Scienza d'intorno alla natura delle nazioni, met with inexpressible praise by all the eminent men reading it here in Venice, and the more they read it the greater their admiration and esteem for your mind which composed it."6 This famous exchange of letters between the friar and the philosopher, intended to promote the Venetian edition of the Principi, is one of the first signs of Lodoli's activity and of its cultural relevance in contemporary Venice. From the letter by Antonio Conti enclosed with Lodoli's own text, we learn that "Your Most Illustrious Lordship could not hope to find a correspondent more versed in every type of study or more authoritative about publishers than Father Lodoli, who is offering to have the book published for you."7 In 1728 the friar was highly esteemed as a cultured intellectual who had, together with Gian Antico di Porcia, promoted a series of autobiographies of illustrious men.8 The first and only work to be published in the series was none other than Vico's autobiography, which appeared in 1725. While we have concrete proof that Giovambattista Vico had contact with Lodoli, who admired his work, we can only hypothesize about the existence of relations with Piranesi. The writings of the Venetian architect clearly reveal his knowledge of the philosopher's works, but some believe that his journey to Naples in 1743 may have provided him with an occasion to meet Vico in person, given the latter's close ties to Raimondo di Sangro, for whom Antonio Corradini, Piranesi's friend, was working 6 "Qui in Venezia con indicibil applauso corre per le mani dei valentuomini il di lei profondissimo libro de' Principi di una Scienza d'intorno alla natura delle nazioni, e piu che van leggendo, piu entrano in ammirazione e stima per la vostra mente che i'ha composto."

Mario Fubini (Turin 1965) 72. 7"Non poteva Vostra Signoria illustrissima ritrovare un corrispondente piu versato in ogni genere di studi e piu autorevole co' librari di quel che sia ii padre Lodoli, che le offre di far stampare il libro."

It is far easier to hypothesize an acquaintance between Lodoli and Piranesi. In the second vol- ume of the Elementi di architettura lodoliana, written more than twenty years after Lodoli's death, Andrea Memmo informs us that the Franciscan ". . . accepted all those elegant inventions by the Greeks and Romans that still survive and are also depicted in the engravings of many books, in particular in that one titled Della magnificenza ed architettura de' Romani . . . by Cavalier Piranesi, published only a few months before his death and which I believe had been sent to him as a gift by the author, who was a friend of his." lo Moreover, it seems fairly likely that Piranesi would have had occasion to meet him. During the late 173 Os and the early 1740s, Lodoli was a leading figure in Venice's cultured circles. His own particular philosophical and architectural school was attended by scions of the leading Venetian families, including Foscari, Memmo, and Foscarini himself, who had some kind of tie to Piranesi. Lodoli was a familiar face in Consul Smith's salon and was also well known in the milieu of the Lucchesi family, as well as to Temanza (who was rather hostile to him) and Scalfarotto. Unfortunately, the only surviving letters are from Temanza to Piranesi; there are no traces of direct correspondence between the Franciscan friar and the draftsman. In fact, virtually none of Lodoli's writings have survived. Although the leading exponent of Lodolian ideas, Andrea Memmo, would only reach Rome after Piranesi's death, he does quote him in both the first and second volumes of his work. Memmo also knew Piranesi's son, Francesco, to whom he gave the task of making the etching for the print of Prato della Valle.11 In conclusion, while it is extremely likely that Lodoli and Piranesi knew each other, they would only have had occasion to meet prior to 1740 in Venice, and possibly during Piranesi's later Vene- tian stay (1744-1745).12 In fact, Lodoli does not seem to have returned to Rome after his youthful stay in the Aracoeli monastery. Certainly Lodoli divulged his ideas not only in person but also by means of letters, reported speeches, and possibly lecture notes. These ideas must have made a strong impression upon Piranesi. 2. Giovambattista Vico Although it would be both impossible and inappropriate to sum up Vico's thought in this article, it would be useful to explain some of the reasons underlying his work. Vico has been defined as 9 Rykwert, First Moderns, p. 374. 10 ... ammetteva tutte quelle eleganti invenzioni de' Greci e de' Romani, che possono vedersi e sussistenti ed incise in molti libri, e particolarmente in quello che ha per titolo Della Magnificenza ed Architettura de' Romani . . . del cavalier Piranesi, uscito pochi mesi prima ch'egli morisse, e che credo essergli stato mandato in dono dallo stesso au- tore di lui amico." Andrea Memmo, Elementi d'architettura lodoliana, ossia l'arte di fabbricare con soliditd scientifica e con eleganza non capricciosa, 2nd ed. (Zara 1833) 139. The first edition was published in 1786 as Andrea Memmo, El- ementi dell'architettura Lodoliana ossia l'arte del Fabbricare con Soliditd scientifica e con Eleganza non Capricciosa (Rome 1786). The 1786 edition lacks the second part found among Memmo's papers and only published at Zadar in 1834. The quotations below are taken from the Zadar edition. 11 See Renato Finesso, "La veduta del Prato della Valle di Francesco Piranesi," Padova e il suo territorio 15, no. 86 (2000) 18-19. 12 For Piranesi's biography, see the other essays in the volume.

In De ratione (1709) he considers the first stages of man's learning and educational process; in De antiquissima (1710), the beginnings of Latin civilization; and in his Scienza nuova (1725), the mythical period during which humankind came into being. In De nostri temporis studiorum ratione (1709) two themes clearly emerge. The first is the pedagogical tension experienced by a science seeking a truth that unites reason with spirit and math- ematical with humanist sciences. The second is the important role played by fantastical resources in reconstructing knowledge-that is, by the stage of the process preceding analytical thought. While the scientific and pedagogical aspect may have interested Lodoli, who had stronger leanings toward the autonomous value of science, the second theme is unequivocally Piranesian. A more immediate analogy is provided by De antiquissima Italorum sapientia ex linguae lati- nae originibus eruenda Proemium (1710). Here it is the philosopher's intent to show that the Latin language is precociously rich in learned terms derived from the Jonians and the Etruscans, and he writes, "Moreover, the fact that the architecture of the Etruscans is simpler than that of any other people affords weighty proof that they had knowledge of geometry before the Greeks."'3 It is possible to try to reconstruct the philosophy of the ancient Latins based on the values of their words, creating what might be termed imaginary primordial Latin metaphysics deriving from a philological and etymological analysis. This is a process resembling the one carried out by Piranesi in Della magnificentia (1761). In the same way that etymologies allow us to reconstruct the mythical primordial metaphysics of the ancient Italics, so does Piranesi's dissection of the ruins of antiquity serve to reconstruct the identity of original Roman architecture. The reappraisal of Latin civilization as well as of Roman law, defended by both Vico and Piranesi against those who traced it back to Attic law, belongs to the complex refounding of the history of humanity that would give new emphasis to fantasy and myth. In this context, art frees itself of every supposed imitative origin. Poetic creation is born of imagination, which for the Latins, according to Vico, coincides with memory: "in ordinary Italian, inmmaginare is equivalent to the memorare of the Latins."'14 These themes are echoed in Lodoli's ideas, in his negation of anthropomorphism, of the relation between men and buildings, and of the mythical origins of the art of building. Another fundamental concept for Vico is the equivalence between verum andfactum: "Hence it is reasonable to assume that the ancient sages of Italy entertained the following beliefs about the true. 'The true is precisely what is made' (Verum esse ipsum factum)." 5 History is made by men; knowing means doing. This militant idea of knowledge is implied in all Lodolian thought. Where Vico and Lodoli diverge is with regard to the importance of myth, of sense and passion, and of metaphor, all of which imbue things with meaning and importance. While the former tried to combine new and ancient knowledge, Lodoli fully subscribed to the new science of Bacon and Galilei. This also represents an area of divergence between the Franciscan and his presumed student Piranesi, whose leanings were undoubtedly in the direction of the philosopher's mythical thought. 3. Carlo Lodoli While this superficial investigation of Vico's thought is based on the many volumes he published, any attempt to understand Lodoli's ideas must first overcome the obstacle of using only secondhand 13 Giambattista Vico, On the Most Ancient Wisdom of the Italians Unearthed from the Origins of the Latin Language, trans.

In fact, there are virtually no existing manuscripts attributable to him-just some scattered letters in Italian libraries and a few other manuscripts of little interest.'6 Nearly all our knowledge of his ideas comes from works written about him by others, in particular Andrea Memmo and his Elementi di architettura lodoliana, a highly unusual work blending biography, architectural treatise, literary narrative, and other genres. Rather than narrating the facts or explaining Lodoli's thought, this Venetian nobleman's work, published more than twenty years after his teacher's death, aims at creating a literary myth, making no mystery of its intention to reconstruct Lodoli's work and thought a posteriori: "My intention was to render honor to a friend of mine without any help from him or from others, and it was a miracle of memory to have said so much, maybe even too much." 17 Memmo's correspondence contains many letters pressing for news, recollections, or anecdotes from those who had been close to Lodoli during his life. Memmo searched in vain for one of his own letters, written shortly after his meetings with the friar and describing his thought. The book that eventually went into print collates memories of Lodoli with existing literature. Mainly dedicated to a censorious criticism of various buildings, it 16 The only known surviving letters in Lodoli's own hand are a petition for the renewal of his appointment as Commissario di Terrasanta (see n. 18 below) and two letters. The first let- ter (Rovigo, Accademia dei Concordi, MSS Conc. 372\31) was sent from Venice on 17 December 1725 to an eminent figure whose name is unfortunately illegible and concerns a favor asked of Lodoli regarding a book: "I thank you for your excessive indulgence toward me. The post you would offer me is either too far or too close. . . , and I certainly entertain no thoughts of seeking new positions at the moment, I feel so at peace here in Venice, my home, that no other post could be more . . . enjoyable, pleasant, or better recompensed. I hope therefore to be able to serve you here where I am." ("Grazie poi del troppo compatimento ch'ella ha per me. Il luogo ch'ella mi augura o che e troppo lontano o troppo vicino .. ., certo io di presente non l'ho di mira, mi trovo tanto contento qui a Venezia mia Patria, che niente piu ... allegro, compatito e ben provveduto. M'auguro dunque piu tosto l'abilita di poterla servire dove sono.") It is extremely probable that the letter was addressed to Scipione Maffei, who had been pressing Lodoli to accept an appointment in Turin or Padua during that same period. Emerging with great clarity from Lodoli's reply is his attachment to Venice and to the life he led there, which was such that he would rather turn down honors and appointments than abandon the Dominante. Another letter (Florence, Biblioteca Nazio- nale Centrale, Carteggi Vari 3, 89; Carlo Lodoli to Giovanni Antonio Fenaroli, Venice, 8 September 1736) is enlightening as to the vast extent of his interests and relations. In this letter, he describes a number of nautical instruments and books that he advises Fenaroli to purchase in Florence. The other two known letters do not survive but are quoted in Giambattista Vico, "Aggiunta fatta dal Vico alla sua autobiografia (1731)," in Autobiografia, p. 72. Two further manuscripts in the Biblioteca Marciana reveal the friar's historical and political interests with regard to the study and defense of the prerogatives of the Venetian Republic. The first (Biblioteca Marciana, It. MSS VII 414, no. 7809; Carlo Lodoli, Estratti dal dispacci presentati ai riformatori dello studio di Padova da Mons. Graziani . . .in materia di libri proibiti), which is undated, is addressed to the Riformatori dello Studio of Padua and contains copies of a number of sixteenth-century dispatches "concerning forbidden books." It shows how Lodoli, who was responsible for censoring the books published in the republic, had sought support for his liberal attitude in the past. In the seven introductory pages to these dispatches, he defends the freedom of judgment that the censors of the time had managed to maintain, overcoming "the difficulty of reconciling the rights of the Empire with those of the priesthood ... , which is rightfully considered to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest difficulty that can be encountered in all government administration" ("la difficolta di concertare convenientemente li diritti dell'impero con quelli del sacerdozio .. ., con tutta la ragione vien reputato per una delle maggiori, se non la principale di quante pos- sano incontrarsene in tutta l'amministrazione deli governi"). See Carlo Lodoli, Della censura dei libri: 1730-36, ed. Mario Infelise (Venice 2001). The other manuscript (Venice, Bib- lioteca Marciana, It. MS VII 415, no. 7810, Carlo Lodoli, a copy in his own hand of the Ricordi per lo scrivere la Historia della Repubblica di Venezia di questi tempi by Agostino Valier, "A sua Eccellenza Il signor Carlo Runini Cancelliere e Procuratore di San Marco. Fra Carlo Lodoli dell'Ordine dei Minori Osservanti") is the copy dated 1725 of Agostino Valier's Ricordi sent by Lodoli to Carlo Runini, Chancellor and Procurator of San Marco. The original manuscript was found by Lodoli in Raimondo Bembi's library, where he had gone "to please the 'bel genio' of my great friend the Most Illustrious Marquess Scipione Maffei" ("per compiacere al bel genio dellIlI.mo Sig.Marchese Scipione Maffei mio grandissimo amico"). 17 "Ho voluto render onore in qualche modo ad un amico mio senz'alcun aiuto altrui ne suo, e fu un miracolo della memoria l'aver detto tanto e forse troppo."

Moreover, there are legitimate doubts about the accuracy of this "assemblage." In the few cases where it proved possible to collate Memmo's affirmations with documentary evidence, errors were found. According to Memmo, the friar became a Commissario di Terrasanta in 1739, while a petition Lodoli sent to the Vatican in 1743 shows that he received the title in 1742.18 The Elementi also contains numerous references to Lodoli's firm intention not to publish his ideas, quoting him as having said, "I would be more than willing to organize my materials for use by my friends, but I have no intention of publishing any of my writings ... unless forced to do so. "19 However, other evidence seems to suggest that Lodoli did in fact intend to publish. On 23 August 1741 Bonomo Algarotti wrote to his brother Francesco in Berlin: "Lodoli, the author of a new system of architecture, is about to publish a violent foreword to his book, making mention of you as a man whose Newtonianism illustrates this century. I will be sure to send you a copy as soon as it comes out as I am sure that you will appreciate the novelty of the concept as well as the style."20 In a letter dated 16 June 1754 published in Memorie per servire alla storia delle Belle Arti, also quoted by Memmo, Girolamo Zanetti, after briefly illustrating the novel characteristics of Lodolian thought, wrote: "... . after two decades, having completed his laborious scheme, this man who has withstood so many hardships has put his system down on paper and is now ready to publish."'2' Well-founded rumors that Lodoli was about to go to print circulated on at least two occasions during a period of more than a decade. It is likely therefore that this was his intention. Bonomo's remarks, so clear and precise, written to the person who would become the first expounder of Lodolian ideas, seem to resolve any doubts. It is extremely likely that Lodoli had a manuscript ready to print. The preface was completed as early as 1741, the rest of the text from 1754 onward. We can reasonably suppose that this work was lost together with Lodoli's other papers, although some traces may be found in the indices discovered by Memmo and published in the second edi- tion of his Elementi.22 Despite these lacunae, it is by means of Memmo's work and through collation with the few other sources available (Sceriman, Algarotti's essay, Zanetti, etc.), and, in particular, with Lodoli's indices (added to the second volume of Memmo's work, which was only published in 1833), that it is possible to reconstruct Lodoli's thought, briefly summarized below. An initial approach might define Lodoli as a revolutionary who applied radical criticism to architecture in order to refound the 18 Vatican Secret Archive, Segreteria Memoriali, 1743, Reg- istro 93, fol. 528, Petition of Father Lodoli of 25 January 1743: ". . . genuflecting I implore your Holiness to issue a breve extending my appointment as Commissario di Terra Santa on behalf of the Serenissima Repubblica, which I have exercised from 1 March 1742 by adding three years to the original twelve" (". . . nell'impiego che esercito dal 1 marzo 1742 di Commissario di Terra Santa per tutto lo stato della Serenissima Repubblica, genuflesso implora dalla S.ta Vostra in forma di breve la conferma della sua carica con l'aggiunta di tre anni alli dodici"). The petition was accepted on 26 March. 19 "Volentieri andr6 disponendo per i miei amici meglio che potr6 la materia; ma al certo non uscira me qualunque scritto, non che stampa per luniversale, quando non me ne trovassi pfi che costretto."

This definition itself communicates an important idea, one often misunderstood by architectural historians. Fundamental for Lodoli is the idea of truth, not that of utility. In other words, he is far less of a functionalist than is usually supposed. He shares this quality with Laugier. Both architectural writers wished to create rules corre- sponding to the truth, although their ideas of what was truth in architecture differed. According to Laugier, the origin of architecture guarantees its truth, whereas Lodoli felt that truth is intrinsic to the art of building itself and to its materials. Lodoli's thought is characterized, on the one hand, by radical criticism of existing architecture-"ut eruas et destruas"-and, on the other, by the attempt to refound it using new rules-"ut plantes et aedifices." He does not, however, refuse ornament as such, merely false ornament, as when it represents in stone a material such as wood. According to the indices published by Memmo, his treatise was to be structured as an erudite, rather than practical, one. The first section, a "Discorso Premiale" on the origin and growth of the art of building, included an " [e]xamination of the various hypotheses on the first buildings erected in differing climates and using different combinations of physical elements." ("Esame delle varie ipotesi sulle prime fabbriche erette in diversita di climi e di fisiche combinazioni. )23 This was to be followed by "Libro I," an "[ilmpartial and philosophical examination of the first known systems, beginning with the Egyptian, Etruscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, going on to composite systems and ending with the French and Spanish systems." ("Esame imparziale e filosofico dei primi conosciuti sistemi, cominciando dall'egizio, etrusco, dorico, ionico, corintio, poi dal composito, ed alfine dal francese e dallo spagnolo. ") Chapter 2 promised a " [d]escription of the defects, or crimes and contradictions present in the five orders: the physical and practical damage and harm deriving from them, and the demonstrable conviction of their nonexistence in stone." ("Esposizione dei difetti, anzi delitti e delle contraddizioni che vi sono nei cinque ordini: danni e pregiudizii fisici e pratici derivanti da quelli, e la convinzione dimostrativa della loro insussistenza in pietra.")24 Here there are two basic concepts: the first is historicism, the idea of different origins-which we have seen partly taken up by Vico-as well as the importance of the testimony of the past. We know that Lodoli collected works of art and artifacts from all past periods, drawings of Oriental architecture, books and memoirs on architecture that compensated for ". . . the vacuum of Vitru- vius. 25 This type of primitive architecture also has a structural value: "[A]rchitecture built by the Orientals originates from stone; it was passed on by the Egyptians to the Phoenicians, then to the Tyhrrenes and Etruscans, and the art of construction achieved its first aim, which was the solidity and duration of buildings."26 The link with the architecture of the Cloaca Maxima and the other primitive architectural environments illustrated by Piranesi is clearly evident. The other basic concept is his refusal to accept that the system of orders is a natural system deriving from the primitive hut. Didascalo's violent words attacking the primitive hut, the famous tirade demolishing all architecture, beginning with the unsolvable contradiction of wall and column, where all that remains is "campagna rasa," derive from architecture's degree zero proclaimed by the Venetian friar.27 23 Ibid., 2:51. 24 Ibid., 2:52. 25 ". . . il vuoto di Vitruvio." Ibid., 1:94. 26 [C]he l'architettura fra gli Orientali trasse la sua origine dalla pietra; che dagli Egizi comunicassi ai Fenicii, ai Tirreni ed Etruschi, ed erasi condotta l'arte del fabbricare al suo primario oggetto ch'e la solidita e la durata degli edifizii." Ibid., 1:34. 27 G. B. Piranesi, "Opinions on Architecture: A Dialogue," in Observations on the Letter of Monsieur Mariette, ed. John Wilton-Ely, trans. Caroline Beamish and David Britt (Los Angeles 2002) 106: "Let us observe the walls of a building</page><page sequence="8">202 GIAN PAOLO CONSOLI The third paragraph of the treatise was intended to deal with the founding of the new architecture: "On the necessity for a new system, so as to prevent civil architecture from being forced to use the same architectural phases, members, composite orders, or terms used in the past, and on the subsequent necessity of rediscovering new shapes and terms, subjugated to need, and in as great a variety as required by its eventual expansion."28 There is no negation of ornament, just defense of invention based on the properties of the materials to be used for the new ornament. The treatise was to illustrate "Due parti integrali primarie," architectural solidity and analogy, or architectural proportion in general, followed by "La prima parte integrale secondaria," which is "comodo," or commodity, divided into distribution and economy, and "La seconda parte integrale secondaria," which is "ornament in general, that is arbitrary properties or appropriate characteris- tics that can be introduced at pleasure in the structures, which must, however, always derive from the "complessa-rettificata-mentale-meccanica scelta" or logical choice of materials."29 Ornament, therefore, has the same importance as "comodo" with respect to proportion, or functionality with respect to solidity. Although the decision to structure his work as a scholarly treatise led to some difficulties, includ- ing occasionally ambiguous terminology, the architecture proclaimed by Lodoli was never as plain, severe, and rigorous as suggested by some of his critics, who were spurred on by Algarotti, his main supporter. His condemnation of the ornament of the five orders for being false was motivated not by a desire to condemn all ornament but by the desire to invent new architectural members, termed replacements ("sostituzioni") by Memmo, which Lodoli even attempted to draw. In an effort to elucidate this concept, Memmo writes, "And with respect to ornament his only wish was . . . that each ornament was to have a different meaning [with respect to the others] and that each element be placed in such a way that it could express its intrinsic truth."30 The notion that stone members should not try to imitate wood leads to the assertion that ". . . one must invent new members that are an expression of the following: the materials used in making the building and the purpose of the member in question."'31 He continues by maintaining that the members of the five orders are few in number: "By choosing to make use of so few characteristics in our oration, even if it were based on the truth, it would be neither eloquent nor harmonious."32 And it is referring to the extension of these decorative possibilities that Memmo quotes Piranesi, writing, from inside and outside. These walls terminate in architraves and all that goes with them above; below these architraves, most often we find engaged columns or pilasters. I ask you, what holds up the roof of the building? If the wall, then it needs no architraves; if the columns or pilasters, what is the wall there for? Choose, Signor Protopiro, Which will you demolish? The walls or the pilasters? No answer? Then I will demolish the whole lot. Take note: buildings with no walls, no columns, no pilasters, no friezes, no cornices, no vaults, no roofs. A clean sweep." 28 "Sopra la necessita di un nuovo istituto, perche non resti imprigionata l'architettura civile nelle fasi, ne' membri, ne' compositi, e ne' termini stessi architettonici finora usati: come pure sopra la conseguente indispensabilita di ritrovare nuove forme e nuovi termini, inservienti al bisogno, in tutta quella copia che alla possibile estensione sua si ricercasse." Memmo, Elementi, 2:52. 29 ... l'ornamento in genere, delle determinate proprieta arbitrarie, o convenevoli caratteri che possono introdursi a piacere nelle moli; ma che sempre derivar devono dalla complessa-rettificata-mentale-meccanica scelta della materia tutta che la riguarda." Ibid., 2:57. 30 "E rispetto agli ornati altro non voleva . . . che tutti avevano un significato diverso l'uno dall'altro, non si ponessero mai contro la giusta loro collocazione onde meglio si potesse la verita di cio che esprimer dovevano." Ibid., 2:125. 31 "* . fosse necessario d'inventare dei membri nuovi che contenessero quello ch'esprimesse precisamente, e la diversa materia di cui fosse la fabbrica composta, e l'uffizio del medesimo membro."

For similar reasons he accepted all those elegant inventions by the Greeks and Romans that still survive and are also depicted in the engravings of many books, in particular in that one titled Della magnificenza.3 This is not the occasion for further discussion of Lodoli's ideas, in particular the concepts of function and representation, which have been described and explained in detail by Joseph Rykwert. I would, however, like to return to the concept of analogy, which I believe is partly taken up by Piranesi. The second index contains the following definition: "Analogy is that well-proportioned regular convenience of the parts and the whole, which must be ensured in buildings through the use of stereometric arithmetic theories combined with rational rules that can be applied to the shape and measurement of the architectural phases, members, and openings."34 Therefore, the primary rule when designing a building is the conciliation of all its parts according to a consistent unitary logic. Different ornament may be applied provided it is coherent with the underlying logic. While the ideas linking Lodoli and Piranesi are undoubtedly clear by now, we must not forget what it is that keeps them so radically distant. Lodoli's conviction that architecture is fundamentally a science, the fundamental premise of his entire theoretical construct, could never be subscribed to by Piranesi, the proud supporter of the inventive freedom of both art and artists. 4. Giovambattista Piranesi It is obviously impossible to extrapolate a comprehensive and consistent system of thought from the writings of Giovambattista Piranesi, who was not a systematic thinker like Lodoli and Vico. But although his writings contain many repetitions and contradictions, it may be possible to identify a core idea in the wake of my comments about Lodoli and Vico. The Lodolian character of some of the images that appeared in Piranesi's Carceri (second ed., 1761) has already been pointed out.35 Here the two materials, wood and stone, are fully independent with respect to their structural logic. Arches, vaults, and pillars follow the laws of lithology, while tie beams, beams, and struts follow those of xylology. It is obvious that even prior to 1760 Piranesi was carrying out a study of the relation between building material and form inspired by Lodoli's ideas. In 1761 he published Della magnificenza ed architettura de' Romani. The ambition of this weighty, erudite tome, liberally sprinkled with classical quotations and difficult to wade through, is revealed by the very title: to affirm the supremacy of Rome and of its architecture over the Greek preeminence advanced by Ramsay and Le Roy (who are both widely quoted) and by Winckelmann himself, who is never mentioned. This task had already been tackled by other intellectuals to whom Piranesi may have turned for some sections of his long text.36 Although Piranesi is not the author of 33 "Trattandosi di qualche linea in piu, credeva il padre Lodoli, che non si dovesse stringere la via alle variazioni, salva sempre la solidita reale ed apparente. Per somiglianti ragioni, ammetteva tutte quelle eleganti invenzioni de' Greci e de' Romani, che possono vedersi e sussistenti ed incise in molti libri, e particolarmente in quello che ha per titolo Della magnificenza." Ibid., 2:139. 34 "Analogia e quella proporzionata regolar convenienza delle parti e del tutto, che risultar deve nelle fabbriche da stereometriche-aritmetiche teorie combinate colle ragionevoli norme applicabili alla forma e misura delle fasi, de' membri, de' fori e de' vasi architettonici." Ibid., 2:60. 35 Rykwert, First Moderns, p. 74. 36 For the composition of the text and the relationship between Piranesi and Ridolfino Venuti, see the essay by Susanna Pasquali in this volume.

John Wilton-Ely (Farnborough 1972).</page><page sequence="10">204 GIAN PAOLO CONSOLI the entire text, he is somehow its guiding genius. This learned, ponderous dissertation, dotted with repetitions and plagiarisms (the description of the birth of architecture from the hut almost repeats Algarotti's arguments word for word),37 is almost obsessive in its pursuit of its aim: to demonstrate the superiority of Rome, above all as a place where architecture may be studied. Stripped of the defense provided by the monuments described above, the means by which-it was thought by some-she kept the arts under her patronage, what will Greece turn to when someone goes there to study; what will she show him by way of instruction? Not capitals, because with the exception of those in the Erechtheion there is not one that compares to Roman ones; she will not show him her columns; they can be found in every size and shape in Rome; nor will she show him statues or bas reliefs: the ones in Rome are extremely varied and elegant. We areinot trying to establish who was the author of such works, the Greek or Roman people, but which is the most suitable location for learning about these arts, Rome or Greece.38 Piranesi wishes to establish not which architecture is better but which is the best place for com- prehending it. He demonstrates this using three types of argument. The first is historical. According to Piranesi, it is not true that Romans were backward with respect to the Greeks; in fact, the Tuscans surpassed them in many areas. Piranesi assigns a positive value to the simplicity and poverty of early Roman architecture. Here the link to Vico is evident. Piranesi's second claim is functional. The Romans' large-scale works, such as sewerage systems, aqueducts, and paved roads, were incomparable to the equivalent Greek works in terms of both their utilitarian scope and their simple structural form. This reflects both Vico's claim to the primacy of Etruscan architecture and the importance attributed by Lodoli to early architectural works of great formal simplicity. The third argument is the one we would 37 G. B. Piranesi, Della magnificenza ed architettura de' Ro- mani (Rome 1761) cix: "given that the ancients made their huts by driving tree trunks and forked branches directly into the ground, the Doric people followed their example by building columns without bases and with no means of support. The Corinthians, on the other hand, like the loni- ans and Tuscans, placed a plinth below them, doing so for neither static nor aesthetic purposes but because they well knew that the ancient inhabitants of the forests had observed how the section of the trunk in the ground would rot or sink in too deeply because of the subsidence of the earth; they therefore placed below them large planks or stone slabs thus giving birth to the base and the plinth." ("imperocche, avendo quegli antichi, nel far le loro capanne, conficcato in terra tanto le forche, quanto i tronchi degli alberi, ed es- sendo stati seguitati dai popoli di Dori col piantar che questi fecero parimente in terra le colonne senza base, e senza alcun sostentamento; I Corintij all'incontro, come anche iJoni, ed i Toscani vi sottoposero il plinto non essenso a loro paruto in tal modo a proposito ne per l'utile, ne per l'apparenza; a cio tanto pi6 fecero , quanto che sapevan ben eglino, che quegli antichi abitatori deile foreste dall'aver veduto , che la parte de' tronchi conficcata in terra facilmente si imputridiva, o veniva a profondarsin piu del dovere per la debolezza del terreno, si erano indotti a porvi sotto talora o grosse tavole o pietre; diedero lume al ritrovamento della base e del plinto.") Francesco Algarotti, Saggio sopra l'architettura (Bologna 1758) 46: "Those beams driven directly into the ground are represented by the Doric column without the base. But they [the first builders] soon became aware of two drawbacks to this method: the beams would sink in too far due to the load that they bore and the decaying of the wood resulting from the damp earth. They resolved both problems by placing one or more planks of wood below the beams." ("Furono da principio quelle travi fitte immediatamente in terra il che rappresentato ci viene dal dorico senza base. Ma si accorsero ben tosto di due inconvenienti che ne seguivano: e del troppo ficcarsi che facevano dentro terra aggravate dal sovrapposto carico e dall'oltraggio che venivano a ricevere dalla umidita della stessa terra. Per rimediare dunque cosi all'uno come all'altro inconveniente, vi posero sotto uno o piu pezzuoli di tavola.") 38 "Destituita pertanto la Grecia della difesa de' monumenti fin qui riferiti, co' quli sembrava ad alcuni ch'elle difendesse le arti come tenute sotto il suo patrocinio, ove si rivolgera ella, o se qualcuno si trasferira 1a per studiare, che gli porra ella avnti per istruirlo? Non gli mostrera capitelli; perche toltone quello d'Eretteo non v'e n'e uno da potersi paragonare co' romani: non gli mostrera colonne; essendovene tante piu in Roma di qualsivoglia sorta e grandezza: non gli mostrera statue n6 bassorilievi; de' quali trovasi in Roma in paragone di quei dei greci un'estrema copia ed eleganza ... imperoc- che ora non andiamo cercando , chi sia stato l'autore di tali opere, se il popolo Greco, o il Romano; ma qual sia il luogo phi a proposito per apprendere queste arti, se Roma o la Grecia?"

The pluralistic nature of Roman antiquity means that surviving parts do not belong to a lost whole but represent entries in a formidable infinite cata- logue that can be directly used as architectural material. The plates that follow provide a detailed illustration of these infinite possibilities: moldings, sections of columns, fragments of entablatures,</page><page sequence="13">ARCHITECTURE AND HISTORY 207 plaques, stelae, and many more. He presents us with a collection of materials with which one can create architecture, sometimes comparing them to Greek examples. Moreover, toward the end of the essay we find an invitation written by Leroy himself: ". . . may he enter the field with the blessing of God and men to invent new rules and new orders to decorate and refine architecture; this will prove the quickest way for his name to gain fame and praise."39 Piranesi tries to reconcile his bewildering rationalist criticism of the Greeks' presumed licen- tiousness by means of statements like the following: "I also believe that if the builder of a house decided to decorate the supporting members and other parts with ornaments that were the fruit of his imagination or, rather, whim, and that were unsuited to the nature of the building, he would be departing from nature."40 He also condemns Greek architecture using the example of St. Mark's Basilica in Venice and its ornaments, which ". . . make it easy for us to deduce the extent of the inconstancy of Greek ingeniousness in architecture and reveal how the Greeks gradually did what- ever they liked."'"I On the one hand, it is almost as if the radicalism of the arguments contained in Della magnifi- cenza allowed the writer to criticize his rigorist enemies using their own weapons. A few years later, in the Parere (1765), Piranesi would defend himself saying, A rigorist had reproached the Romans for having corrupted Greek architecture; and Piranesi was obliged to show him that, on the contrary, the Romans, having adopted an architecture that was found to be infected to the core, and finding themselves consequently unable to cure its ills, attempted to mitigate them. Now, compare the spirit of that book with what I have just told you, and then judge whether Piranesi has changed his opinion.42 The purpose of the description of the hut and of the criticism of the single elements deriving from it contained in Della magnjficenza is, in fact, to introduce the need for a new approach to architecture, following in the wake of the Lodolian tabula rasa. On the other hand, omnipresent in Piranesi's writings are not only his support of freedom in inventing ornaments but also a call for precision and appropriateness in the ornaments themselves. In Della magnzficenza he writes, ". . . neither can one approve those works of architecture that do not originate in truth."43 In the Parere su l'architettura, his most polemical writing with regard to the rigorists, he tries to clarify this duality, explaining, "take away every man's freedom to decorate as he sees fit, and you will very soon see the architectural sanctum open to all and sundry."44 But not all ornaments are beautiful; beautiful ornaments are those that achieve mutual harmony and harmony with the whole, securing a reconciliation of the parts with the whole: this, I believe, must be achieved and maintained not only in these attributes of architecture but also in all ornaments that one might someday .. . mettasi pure in campo con la benedizione del Cielo, e degli uomini, inventi nuove regole, e nuovi ordini per adornare ed arricchire l'architettura; fara ci6 per esso la via piu spedita a procacciarsi lode e fama del suo nome." Ibid., p. cxcix. 40 "Altrettanto cred'io si allontanerebbe dalla natura, chi, postosi a fabbricare una casa, si supponesse di doverne parare i sostegni , e tutte le altre parti, non gia di ornamenti adattati alla natura dell'edificio, ma di quanti ne sapesse inventar l'ingegno, o per meglio dire il capriccio." Ibid., p. xcix. 41 ". . . dalle quali pu6 facilmente desumersi quanto sia stato irregolare l'ingegno de' greci nell'architettura, essendosi eglino presa a poco a poco la liberta di farvi tutto quello che volevano."

In the drawings that prompted this discussion of ours, Piranesi has found a way to convey information to us through a work of art, realizing that to do so in words would be difficult.45 This idea of reconciliation bears a strong resemblance to Lodolian analogy and is therefore the underlying concept for the unique architectural compositions invented by the architect. Similar reasoning pervades the Ragionamento apologetico in difesa dell'architettura Egizia e Toscana (the introduction to the 1769 Diverse maniere di adornare i camini), together with his pride in having created a new style: "There is no human intellect so restricted and limited that it cannot endow works of architecture with new embellishments and new graces, provided it combines an attentive in-depth study of nature with an equally profound one of ancient monuments."46 It also contains the following advice: "Let the architect be as bizarre as he wishes yet not deform architec- ture and ensure that each member has its own distinct character."47 We have at this point reached the core of Piranesian thought. In the Parere, his criticism of the imitation of the primitive hut and of the architectural orders themselves assumes a Lodolian radical- ism: "we practice only one manner of architecture, though we are loath to admit that a diversity of ornamentation does not in itself constitute a diversity of orders. To be more precise, we cultivate three manners-or, if you prefer, orders-in architecture: one composed of columns, one composed of pilasters, and one composed of a continuous wall."48 Using the basic structural elements of archi- tecture, it is possible to create a new vocabulary, one that is exceedingly varied though consistent with the logic of the building itself. The vocabulary of Piranesian architectural members somehow corresponds to the replacement of the old members described by Lodoli. The plates added to the Parere (fig. 3) have been rightly interpreted as illustrating a new formal language of absolute and almost bewildering originality.49 Having established that the architect may, and indeed must, create new ways, he need only, when inventing the language of the new architecture, remain faithful to the Lodolian analogy and the relation between the parts and their logic. Thus in the Parere he describes how the ornament of a building should "single out the main subject from the accompaniment.... The decorations should be graded as things are in nature, some being more imposing and dignified than others. In such art, as in nature, the eyes will see not confusion but a beautiful and pleasing arrangement of things."50 45 Ibid., p. 113. 46 "Non e l'umano ingegno si corto e limitato che dar non possa alle opere di architettura nuovi abbellimenti e nuovi garbi, qualora si voglia ad uno studio attento e profondo della natura accoppiare quello altresi degli antichi monumenti."

Plate IX (fig. 4) added to the Parere helps us understand this principle of hierarchy through the identification of superimposed planes: has reliefs in the foreground, an unorthodox continuous fascia frieze supported by an architectural order, an architrave supported by another architectural order supporting the temple pediment, and a slightly projecting end wall. Thus, "we cultivate three manners-or, if you prefer, orders-in architecture: one composed of columns, one composed of pilasters, and one composed of continuous walls."15' The rich and fantastic decoration applied to these basic architectural elements shows that Piranesi is not an out-and-out Lodolian, as the following remarks confirm: "What will you say, if I prove to you that austerity, reason, and imitation of huts are all incompatible with architecture? That architecture, far from requiring decorative features derived from the parts necessary for con- structing and holding up a building, consists of ornaments that are all extraneous?"152 He clearly reveals his distance from the idea of architecture as a science.

This vein has not yet been exhausted. Every day new pieces are unearthed beneath the ruins, and we are presented with new things well able to inspire the ideas of a reflexive thinking creator.
