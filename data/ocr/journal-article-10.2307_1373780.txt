According to the story, she killed the man who destroyed her young, but his companion escaped to tell about it. The other mythical otter is called mis-in-tsuk, being about ten feet long and built almost exactly like a seal. It is said not to be dangerous unless attacked. One Davis Inlet man claims to have seen this animal in atcagon napeesh or Little Seal Lake (a short distance northeast of Seal Lake). Since harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are fairly common in these lakes,l8 it seems probable that the Indians have combined the characteristics of seal and otter into this mythical conception. They have often killed seals there, but no one has ever killed one of these giant otters. The Naskapi tend to people the lonely and desolate reaches of the interior with many malevolent and supernatural beings, but all of these, with the above exceptions, are anthropomorphic in character.

NOTES ON SOME MAMMALS OF SOUTlHERN MATTO GROSSO, BRAZIL BY FREDERIC WALTER MILLER [Plates 1-2] The following notes relating to a number of the larger mammals of southern Matto Grosso were all made in a more or less restricted area lying on the west bank of the Upper Paraguay at an approximate latitude of 16? south. The area in question (see map), being bordered on the east by this river, extends westward to the frontier of Bolivia, and from the Rio Jauru on the north, to Lake Gaiba on the south. It is admit- tedly but a tiny portion of the mighty state of Matto Grosso, yet it is an area of kingly size, covering hundreds of square miles. This is Descal- vados, the property of a giant cattle company, of American and English ownership. Ranching has been carried on only in a comparatively limited section adjacent to the port of Descalvados, and the remainder lies, an unspoiled wilderness, with all the characteristic Matto Grossan fauna in striking abundance. Beginning with Colonel Roosevelt's exploring expedition in 1913, 18 See Bangs, op. cit., p. 499. 10</page><page sequence="2">MILLER-MAMMALS FROM SOUTHERN MATTO GROSSO Descalvados has been the objective of numerous naturalists, all of whom have found it, under the administration of Mr. John Gordon Ramsay, to be almost a paradise; his hospitality and generous aid are of a quality seldom equaled and never excelled. From September 7, 1925 until January 13, 1926, the South American Expedition of the Colorado Museum of Natural History, whose object was the collection of habitat group material for exhibition in the new James Memorial addition to that institution, was engaged in this field. Also from April 28 to July 26, 1928, the area was revisited and similar work was carried on. These two expeditions were organized and con- ducted under the direction of Mr. J. D. Figgins, Director of the Museum. The personnel of the first party included F. E. D'Amour, F. G. Branden- burg and the writer; that of the second, J. D. Figgins and the writer. The necessity of securing adequate specimens, accessories and studies for the proposed groups of birds and mammals prohibited any detailed faunal investigations, and while the present paper may give a fair sum- mation of the larger species it is not intended as a mammal list, and relates only to the species indicated. Excepting the rugged, rocky hills at its southern end, and occasional isolated ones scattered about, Descalvados is a level plain only slightly elevated above the Paraguay river, which with a seasonal fluctuation of 12 to 15 feet, floods great areas during periods of high water. Because of its lack of elevation no definite drainage system has been developed, and the water accumulating from the heavy seasonal rains and from the river's flooding occupies the depressions for nearly nine months of the year, forming swamps, resantes, and riachos of a more or less permanent character. In November, at the end of the dry season, which begins in June, water may become very scarce, a condition that exists only for a short period, as, with the approach of the rains, surface water is renewed. While as a whole the area is typical of the pantanal region of the Paraguay basin, several well defined habitats occur. Pantanal and dense matt alternate in parts, while in others, as on most of the elevated ground, high jungle of rather limited extent is found. Inland, much of the country is chapadao, dry, grassy savannas dotted with scattered trees and thick, brushy groves; the latter being known as capons. Low, meandering, sandy ridges, obviously old shore lines remaining from some earlier period, are found traversing much of the level ground. The chapadao is faunally distinct, being characterized by such savanna types as the pampa deer (Blastocerus b. campestris) and the Brazilian ostrich (Rhea a. intermedia). 11</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY On the map are roughly indicated collecting stations occupied during our work.

Some, however, are well known camp grounds, while others are the sites of old corrals formerly used in capturing the wild cattle that abounded in certain sections during the early and more romantic history of Descalvados. It is a pleasure to express again both the Museum's and my own personal gratitude to Mr. Ramsay for the abundant help he freely gave to make our work agreeable and successful. To the many others who also aided, acknowledgment has been made elsewhere.' Procyon cancrivorus nigripes Mivart. Raccoon. Tracks of raccoons were occasionally seen but it was not until May 31,1928 that an animal was encountered. On this date as we were riding across a flooded savanna, our dogs found a female on the ground in a small capon which rose like an island in the sea of grass. The raccoon fought and squalled with all the courage of its northern relatives, though hopelessly outnumbered by the dogs. Nasua nasua solitaris Schintz. Two coatis, both of the red phase, were shot near Juda on September 20, 1925, and on December 11, 1925 a female accompanied by five little youngsters was seen in the heavy timber near Libertad. Coatis make interesting pets and many are seen in the homes of the natives. Chrysocyon brachyurus (Illiger). Red Wolf. While by no means abundant, the red wolf is a fairly common animal in the Descalvados area, particularly in the chapaddo lying to the west. Two specimens were taken, an adult female on November 11, 1925, and an adult male on May 28, 1928. Two others were observed, and a nearly complete skeleton was collected from the remains of one found entangled in the wire fence surrounding an abandoned rosso at Sucuri. The animal had passed its fore feet between the bottom and second strands and then, apparently, its body through the second and third, securing its feet by one com- plete twist of the wire. No doubt it had struggled fiercely for the carnassial teeth were shattered and the heavy gauge wire was deeply cut. The Indians report that two is the usual number of young and that these are born in a nest concealed in the thick of the matt. Fruit is said to compose a large part of their diet and I was told that during the period of ripening figs they will return night after night to feast on the fallen fruit under some favored tree. The stomach of the female taken was empty; that of the male contained seven seeds of the cumbard tree, and the feet and tarsi of a small passerine bird the size of a sparrow. The seeds of the cumbard tree are, roughly, an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch thick, and are thinly covered with a dry mealy pulp. The wolf is also said to prey to considerable extent on small armadillos, frequently 1 Report of the Colorado Museum of Natural History 1925-1926 and 1928. Denver, Colorado. In the preparation of the present notes, I have received assistance from Mr. Colin C. Sanborn and Mr. G. S. Miller, Jr., in arranging and identifying some of the doubtful forms. 13</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY digging them out, but in view of the digging power of the latter this seems ques- tionable. On November 2, 1925 one was seen hunting through a small, jungle-enclosed savanna; where it was pouncing about stiff legged on a zig-zag course after the fashion of a mouse-hunting fox. No doubt the red wolf finds a large share of its sustenance in this fashion, for its long legs surely give it a great advantage over any small creature encountered in the high grass. Felis ramsayi new name.2 Jaguar. The name Felis ramsayi is here proposed as a substitute for Felis paraguensis Hollister (1914), which I regard as preoccu- pied by (Felis) Panthera paragayensis Oken (1816). Allen 1916, (Bul. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., vol. XXXV, p. 578) while not proposing a new name at that time, discussed the question as follows; "The name Panthera paraguensis (referring to Felis paraguensis Hollister, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. vol. 48, pp. 169-170, 1914) is here adopted provisionally, in view of the earlier Panthera paragayensis Oken (1816), given to an ocelot. Oken in his 'Lehrbuch der Naturgeschichte' (dritter Theil, zweite Abtheilung) consistently employed "Paragay" for Paraguay, and in using it as the basis of specific names added the suffix -ensis, giving the form paragayensis, instead of taking "Paraguay" for the stem. . . Both names are etymologically identical." Felis ramsayi, the largest member of the jaguar group, is fairly abundant in the area and numbers of skins are brought in by the Indians for sale. They are distributed over a wide variety of habitat, but show a decided preference for well watered localities. Along the river they are sometimes seen on the banks from the decks of passing launches and less frequently swimming the channel. During our field work we saw considerable evidence of their presence in the way of abandoned kills and other sign. Besides the three taken we pursued several others which for various reasons escaped. A female secured near Tamandua, September 11, 1925, contained a single embryo about six inches long; I have been informed that the jaguar, like the puma, has no definite breeding season. Alligators seem to comprise a large element in their food supply, and with the exception of a wild calf, a wild bull and a swamp deer, they were the only kills found which could be definitely attributed to this animal. At certain periods alligators are found wandering far from deep water and at such times become easy prey. On two occasions we found the remains of three that had been killed within a few feet of each other. All those examined bore marks of the jaguar's teeth on the base of the head and skull and had been opened along the belly. When a kill has been made the jaguar often remains with it for a considerable period, alternately eating and sleeping and, should its quarry be of large size, this may become a matter of days. The black vultures which are everywhere abundant keep a watchful eye on the big cat's activities and are quick to find its kills. The sight of a flock of vultures patiently perched in a tree is an almost sure sign that a jaguar is close by with a quarry it is not yet ready to abandon to them. 2 Named for John Gordon Ramsay, of Descalvados, Matto Grosso, Brazil; whose six specimens of this jaguar donated to to the Roosevelt Expedition were among the first representatives of the race to reach the hands of a naturalist. 14</page><page sequence="6">MILLER-MAMMALS FROM SOUTHERN MATTO GROSSO The usual mode of hunting the jaguar is with dogs trained for the purpose. Despite the fact that none of the three collected was treed, I am convinced that practically all take to trees when pursued by dogs. In Matto Grosso one hears frequent accounts of fatalities that occur on jaguar hunts. At Corumb:i in August, 1925, there was said to be a man in the hospital recovering from lacerations received from a jaguar, and at Sal Obra, a little station on the Nor Ouste R. R. just east of the Paraguay River, we saw, on April 19, 1928, the fresh skin of a jaguar that had mauled one of his pursuers so badly that the man died. However, it is noticeable that all such incidents occur in the case of the poorly armed native, and the jaguar cannot be considered danger- ous to the hunter who is properly equipped. The jaguar spear, which is much used in hunting them in other parts of Matto Grosso, is seldom seen about Descalvados. In using it the hunter's object is to infuriate the beast into charging, when the butt of the spear is rested on the ground and the head so manipulated that the jaguar, as it leaps at its tormenter, is cleverly permitted to impale itself. The least that can be said of this method is that it is truly sporting. Felis pardalis brasiliensis (Oken). Ocelot. Ocelots, from reports, are fairly common and well distributed and a goodly number of skins are sold each year at Descalvados. A fine male was shot from the branches of a fig tree near Tuyuyu on November 27, 1925, and two other specimens were brought in by Indian hunters. The Indians report the ocelot as preying extensively on birds; even successfully stalking and killing the rhea. Felis concolor concolor (Linne). Brazilian Puma. It seems likely that future work will prove the puma of the upper Paraguay to be separable from that of southeastern Brazil, which has been assumed to be typical concolor. In our series of three skins and skulls there are two males and one female. The skins are all remarkably alike in coloration, having a broad dorsal band of dull red, extending from the crown to the tail. The skull of a male taken Novem- ber 25, 1925 agrees well in size with an adult male of true concolor, from Sao Paulo, Brazil, cited by Merriam in his "Preliminary Revision" of the group.3 Pumas are fairly common but judging from the number of skins brought in for sale at Descalvados they do not equal the jaguar by one to two. Their preference in habitat seems to be for the more open and drier portions of the camp particularly in the vicinity of the low, sandy, openly wooded ridges which are of frequent occurrence in some parts. On November 25, 1925, while hunting with dogs, we picked up a puma's track which we soon followed to its kill of the previous night, a young buck pampa deer, (Blastocerus b. campestris) and a short time later secured the beast, an adult male, at no great distance. Another male taken December 1, 1928, had eaten a small ant-eater (Tamandua t. chapadensis). On May 29, 1928 we found two recent kills, consisting of a doe brocket (Mazama simplicicornis), and a hen ostrich. The two kills were about thirty hours old and apparently had been made within an hour or two of each other. The two bodies lay near the point of a low ridge grown with scrubby trees. Both had been partially eaten and left 3 C. H. Merriam, 1901. Proc. Wash. Acad. Sciences. Vol. 111, pp. 577-600. 15</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY to the buzzards. Tracks in the loose, sandy soil proved it to be the work of a large individual, probably a male, who after feeding had made for a nearby water hole to drink and rest, the outline of its body being plainly visible in the matted grass. A female taken December 10, 1925, contained two small embryos. Local information indicates that this is the usual number of young and that they are born at any time of the year without respect to season. The skin of the puma is of little value commercially, bringing only two or three dollars, (15 or 20 milreis). It is strong and durable and many are used locally for making sandal soles. Felis pajeros braccatus (Cope). Bush Cat. A single specimen of this rare cat which has been identified by Mr. G. S. Miller, Jr. of the U. S. National Museum, is in the collection. The specimen was brought in, in the flesh, to our camp west of Lagoona, by an Indian visitor on November 29, 1925. The man's dogs had found and killed it in the chapadao lying between our camp and the Bororo village at Lagoona. In coloration it agrees well with the redescription of the type given by Allen4 thus bearing out his judgment that braccatus is a legitimate race and not a dark melanistic phase of pajeros. Nothing was learned of its habits or distribution other than the Indians report of its being of rare occurrence. Its weakly-clawed feet suggest that it is largely terrestrial and not adept at tree climbing. The stomach of our specimen, a male, was empty. Felis yagouaroundi yagouaroundi (Fischer). Two specimens a male and fe- male, both representing the gray phase of this interesting cat, are in the collection. One was treed on January 6, 1926 by our dogs while hunting jaguars, and the other was secured on June 20, 1928 at Acurizal by Mr. Ramsay and presented by him to the Museum. Callithrix argentata melanura (E. Geoffroy). Marmoset. Four specimens of this interesting little marmoset, which is rare in the locality, were taken. On November 4, 1925, while hunting deer near Sucuri, my attention was drawn to a little buck pampa, standing in the open savanna at one side of a small capon. His interest was equally divided between my approach and something hidden from me behind the capon. Taking the tip I ignored the deer and hurried around the opposite end, finding a little party of these marmosets making off as best they could through the long grass. One was secured, and the remainder, reaching a straggling belt of timber, escaped. In the heavy timber clothing the Bahia Pedra hills they were found also and three specimens were collected there on November 23, 1925. Alouatta caraya (Humboldt). Black Howler. As we traveled up river from Corumb/ late in August, 1925, black howlers were occasionally seen in the early morning moving among the branches of the timber bordering the river. Inland they were found in a number of localities where there was jungle of sufficient extent to suit their needs. During 1925 they were common on Sao Joa hill a short distance north of Descal- vados, and also directly across the river. These localities were found deserted in May and June, 1928, and it seems likely that the howlers perform seasonal migrations of a more or less local character. Allen, J. A., Bul. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 1919, Vol. XLI, pp. 376-380. 16</page><page sequence="8">MILLER-MAMMALS FROM SOUTHERN MATTO GROSSO In August and September, 1925, many of the females were carrying tiny young which clung tightly to the long hair at their breasts. By October all young noted seemed capable of caring for themselves. The full throated chorus of the black howler, rising and falling on the tropical air, is one of the most characteristic and inspiring of jungle sounds. Early morning and evening are the favored hours for these performances, though they are occasionally heard at mid-day, if the sky is overcast by an approaching storm. Urosciurus langsdorffii urucumus (Allen). Squirrel. Two specimens of this squirrel were taken near Bahia Piedra, November 23, 1925. They were not com- mon and this is the only locality at which they were noted. Coendou centralis Thomas. Brazilian Porcupine. A native hunter brought in the remains of a porcupine to Descalvados on December 29, 1925, and on June 15, 1928, the skin of one was purchased from another hunter. Both had been killed in the timber along the river, a short distance from Descalvados. They are reported as uncommon. Hydrochoerus hydrochoeris hydrochoeris (Linne). Capybara. The capybara, largest of rodents, is one of the interesting mammals that is suffering from recent developments in the market for South American pelts. In the past three years there has been a noticeable decrease in their numbers on the upper Paraguay. They are nocturnal, but not strictly so, and where not molested they are quite active in the early morning and late afternoon. In 1925-26 we found them abun- dant along the river, its tributary riachos and wherever there was sufficient water in the pantanals to suit their needs. In late August, 1925, as we came up river by launch from CorumbA we saw numerous individuals and occasional small parties on the banks. Two were shot by our crew and brought aboard for food. The meat has a pronounced flavor and I did not find it palatable. Along the riacho at Aguas Verde where we were camped from September 30 to October 17, 1925, they were very common and in the evening small bands would leave cover and forage out onto the open savanna for some distance. All of our series of 12 individuals were taken at this locality on the foregoing dates. They were most often encountered just before sunset, associated in little groups of both sexes, many of the females being accompanied by young a month or two old. On the after- noon of October 8, I met such a band at an open spot along the bank of the riacho. As soon as I sighted them I dropped on my heels and remained motionless. They were perhaps eighty yards away and approached in leisurely fashion. When half the intervening distance had been covered they seemed first to notice my presence, and, detecting something unusual, turned at right angles and walked slowly out into the water, which was choked with aquatic vegetation, gradually submerging until all were out of sight. After I had waited twenty minutes a male, pursued by another and larger one, rushed out of the water, careened madly about for a few seconds and then pursuer and pursued disappeared again in deep water. All was quiet for ten minutes more, when slowly and without noise the animals re- appeared in the same unhurried manner on the far shore and resumed their promenade. On another occasion I found a female and five young under the overhanging limbs of a thicket bordering the water's edge. They dashed into the riacho, the female diving at once, but the young, seemingly confused, were slower and I shot three, two of which were immediately snapped up by lurking alligators before JOURNAL Ot MAMMALOGY, VOL. 11, NO. I 17</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY I could recover them. As I sat on the bank skinning the remaining young, a big adult came from the thicket behind me, and, pausing at the waters edge, squatted on its "hunkers" and barked at me. I kept motionless as long as my attendant swarms of mosquitoes would permit, and when at last I was forced to brush them from my eyes, the capybara leaped noisily into the water; but it was with some satisfaction that I noted that its ears had been kept twitching by a similar swarm during the entire time. Alligators and the big water constrictors are probably their most dangerous enemies, after man. The former are especially aggressive, and being everywhere abundant within the capybaras' range, must account for many, particularly the young. Pecari tajacu tajacu (Linne). Collared Peccary. Collared peccaries were found in occasional small bands, numbering up to a dozen individuals. We saw no evidence of large herds such as they are said to form in other parts of tropical America, or as were noted in the case of the white-lipped peccary. The usual mode of hunting this peccary is with dogs that pursue and hold them until the arrival of the hunter. When brought to bay they back up against an ant hill or into a thicket of cat-claw and fight desperately, being capable of inflicting severe wounds, as they sometimes do, on inexperienced dogs. To me, it seemed quite strange to find them living in burrows, but such was the case, and in such burrows, or the occasional excavations of the giant armadillo, they sought refuge whenever possible. Burrows that I took to be of their own con- struction were always placed at the roots of a fallen tree, or similar spot, where a natural cavity occurred that could be enlarged with the minimum effort. On No- vember 2, 1928, I found two newly born young at the mouth of their home. Their cries attracted the mother who, on my arrival, was out of sight in a nearby thicket. She made a desperate effort to rejoin them and I shot her. The two young, obviously but a few hours old, had their eyes open and, though a bit unsteady on their legs, nearly succeeded in escaping. The burrow in this case was dug among a tangle of roots and no doubt was originally the work of a giant armadillo. It was about eighteen inches in diameter and descended at an abrupt angle. Tayassu pecari pecari (Link). White-lipped Peccary. The white-lipped peccary is not an abundant animal in the Descalvados area, and was encountered but twice in the course of our work. The first meeting took place on September 24, 1925, near the southern boundary of the area, when a herd of eight or ten individuals was found feeding in the open marshy ground bordering a thick patch of jungle. From these we collected a female that had been accompanied by two young a day or two old; one of these we succeeded in capturing alive. The second encounter took place near the Bolivian frontier on December 11, 1925. In com- pany with an Indian hunter I had followed the trail of a large band for several hours, finally sighting them in a large, fairly open savanna. Being mounted, it was an easy task for me to overtake them. As we galloped up, the bulk of the herd, which numbered at least two hundred individuals, gathered in a compact mass among some scattered bushes and low growing trees. They kept up a con- stant rattling of their tusks and a low eerie moaning. Occasional little parties charged out at us but these our horses easily evaded. The decided aggressive- ness of these animals was very apparent and the repeated warnings from my hunter that I should not dismount, were hardly needed. It was also interesting 18</page><page sequence="10">MILLER-MAMMALS FROM SOUTHERN MATTO GROSSO to note that our dogs, which were accustomed to hunting the collared peccary, refused to approach within several hundred yards. Eight specimens were collected without causing any great alarm among the remainder, who left the spot only after we had retired some distance. They then made off at a good pace and, following them, we caught two wobbly legged young- sters who had not been able to keep up. Young white-lipped peccaries are easily tamed and make interesting pets. Among the three kept by us there was a con- siderable difference in temperament. The first was a little female, extremely affectionate, and she became absolutely desolated when left alone. During the two or three weeks we had her in camp with us she slept each night snuggled up close to one of us on the floor of the tent. On our return to Descalvados we left 'Ed,' as we had named her, there, and she became a great pet about the house. One of the house dogs had given birth to a litter of puppies a short time previous and 'Ed' adopted herself into this family; the mother, after some mis- givings, permitting her to nurse along with the puppies. The other two little pigs, having themselves for company, sought less for that 6f humans, and while thoroughly tame, never overcame a certain wildness. When suddenly touched they would whirl and slash savagely with their little tusks. 'Ed' died at the age of six months from digestive troubles, and the other two, becoming rather vicious with approaching maturity, were finally returned to their native jungle. Blastocerus dichotomus (Illiger). Swamp Deer. The favored habitat of the big ciervo is the papyrus grown pantanal, neighboring the river, though they are by no means confined to it, and are found wherever marshland and cover occur to their liking. In the dry season they are necessarily more restricted in range, and during the wet period and the consequent inundation of large areas they become widely scattered. We seldom found more than two individuals together, although occasional family groups of does and young animals were seen. The bucks, ex- cept in the mating season, seem solitary. The swamp deer is particularly confiding in its attitude toward man, so much so, that they seem positively stupid, and, as a result, they are rare in localities where much hunting is done. I have many times ridden directly to within twenty or thirty yards of an individual. Once a mated pair walked leisurely and unconcernedly through our camp, and at another time a buck, doe and yearling fawn passed within fifty yards of the tents, their progress unhurried by a volley from our Indians' forty-fours. They are frequently shot from the decks of the launches that ply the river between Corumbd and Sao Luis. When alarmed the animals elevate the tail in characteristic deer fashion, and bound off in a laborious rockety manner, which however, is very effective over swampy ground. When the footing is good they are comparatively slow. The antlers of the bucks are regular and well formed. They are dichotomous, heavy and massive. Four is the usual number of points to the side. One bushy head in the collection has eight to the side. Our largest measure 600 mm. along the beam with a spread of 510 mm. Bucks were taken with fully developed antlers during every month we were in the field, that is, May, June and July, and again from September to the following January. One was secured in velvet, on November 16, 1925, and a young buck taken November 6, 1925 had just shed its antlers. Fawns were seen on December 7, 1925 and January 16, 1926. Females in milk were taken in October and November 1925, and these, no doubt, had fawns hidden close by. 19</page><page sequence="11">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY The skin of the swamp deer is regularly sold, the greater portion from Matto Grosso going to the hide markets in Montevideo. The trivial amount they bring the hunter hardly pays for ammunition, nevertheless thousands are shipped annually. Blastocerus bezoarticus campestris (F. Cuvier). Pampa Deer. By far the most abundant and typical game mammal in the chapadao is the little pampa deer. They are at home on the great grassy savanna with its scattering growth of low scrubby trees, especially favoring localities where there have been recent grass fires and the newly sprung forage is green and succulent. They are fleet of foot and graceful in all their movements, bounding with ease over bushes and other obstructions of considerable height. In open flight they frequently leap high into the air after the fashion of the "sky hop" of the jack rabbit, and, no doubt for a similar purpose-increased observation. In May, June and July we found this deer singly and in pairs. Later in Sep- tember they were occasionally seen in small bands and as the season progressed this became more noticeable and often a dozen or more were found in company. The bucks shed their antlers in May, the new ones appearing immediately after and growing rapidly so that by September nearly all are mature and cleaned of velvet. Our record set measures 505 mm. along the beam and has a spread of 256 mm. Early in September, 1925, we made a trip southward to the vicinity of Lake Uberaba, passing through great stretches of ideal deer country. Many were observed but all were adults. Returning a month later over our out-bound trail, we found the same area literally teeming with deer, and every doe accompanied by a fawn. Such was the similarity in the size of the fawns that it seemed that all must have been dropped on a single night. On December 4, 1925 at another locality near the Bolivian frontier a deer count on a two hour ride numbered twenty-six of all ages, and it is likely an equal number escaped observation. However such numbers are found rarely, and much country that is from all appearances equally desirable is practically tenantless. These deer have no metatarsal glands, but from the sac between the phalanges of the hind feet is exuded a powerful scent, which is quite noticeable about re- cently vacated bed grounds or spots from which the deer have been frightened by the advent of an intruder. The meat of the pampa deer is fine-grained and well flavored, though a trifle dry. The hides are thin and delicate; stretched and dried many of them find their way to the markets in Montevideo each year. On several occasions we caught and kept fawns of this species as pets. They are easily tamed and became quite friendly, but as we found it difficult to obtain the proper food required by their tender age our experiments usually ended in failure. Mazama rufa rufa (Illiger). Red Brocket. In the dense, almost impenetrable jungle that borders the river in many places the big red brocket is frequently found. It also occurs inland, though rather sparingly. On January 8, 1926, I collected a male with horns in velvet. On skinning the animal we discovered the flesh on the flank back of the left shoulder to be badly discolored and "blistery." We were in need of the animal for food, but though it appeared in healthy condition otherwise my two Indian companions refused to eat it, saying that if we did we should become affected in a similar fashion. 20</page><page sequence="12">MILLER-MAMMALS FROM SOUTHERN MATTO GROSSO That these deer are good swimmers and take to the water was readily demon- strated by one seen crossing the river near Descalvados on July 15, 1928. The animal entered the water from the west bank at a point where the river is from 350 to 400 yards wide. It struck out boldly and made good headway though naturally drifting some with the current. Landing on the far shore it rested for a moment, re-entered the water, and continued on down stream, keeping close to the bank. Rounding a bend it was met by a canoe load of Indians who shot it and brought it ashore. It was a female and contained a single embryo that would have been born within the next few days. Mazama simplicicornis simplicicornis (Illiger). The little brown brocket is a denizen of thick cover, spending the day in its shelter. In the late evening it sometimes forages out into the open, and belated individuals are occasionally found abroad in the hours of early morning. Males with mature antlers were taken in May, June, November and December. Another individual secured in December was in velvet. A fawn of the year, secured at Sucuri on October 29, 1925, was just losing its spots. Tapirus terrestris terrestris (Linne). Tapir. Tapirs are usually reported as favoring river banks or similar well watered localities where they can escape pursuit by diving. In the Descalvados region we found the reverse to be true and most of our series of seven were taken in areas of scant moisture, some in fact so dry that it was with difficulty we found sufficient water for camp use. In the month of September, 1925, we were camped near Juda (see map) and in that general vicinity secured four. The first, a male, was brought to bay in the heart of a drying papyrus by our dogs while hunting jaguars. A few days later a mated pair were collected as they crossed an opening in a patch of heavy timber. The last from this locality was encountered traveling in the open along the edge of a strip of jungle. While stalking deer near Sucuri, October 22, 1925, I saw a young of the same year cross an open savanna, a quarter of a mile distant, but was unable to secure it. At the same locality a few days later, hunting with an Indian companion, I saw two tapirs enter a dry resante grown up to a tangle of vines and wild cotton. We hunted diligently through the immediate surroundings but failed to start them. However, on returning on the far side of the resante several hours later, we found both sleeping in the shade of an isolated tree. Tapir sign was quite abundant at Sucuri, particularly on the low sandy ridges which the natives flatteringly refer to as cordilleras, despite the fact that the highest does not rise ten feet above the surrounding level. The tapirs were ap- parently attracted there by the ripening fruit of a tree, the name of which I did not learn. The fruit in size and shape somewhat resembles an apricot. It occurs commonly on the ridges and the droppings of the tapir in those localities were largely composed of its hard pits. Near Lagoona on November 13, 1925 my Indian hunter and I ran down a me- dium sized male with our horses. The country at this spot was of the savanna type thickly dotted with capons and small patches of jungle. The two of us by cutting corners were able to keep the tapir in sight and after a run of a mile or two had him completely winded. The eyesight of the tapirs seems bad, and when alarmed they crash blindly off occasionally striking trees with sufficient force to knock themselves down. 21</page><page sequence="13">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY To the Boror6 Indians, who compose the bulk of the local population, the tapir is, with the capybara, a taboo animal or "santo," and is never killed by them. The Boror6's respect, however, is rather flexible and they have but few scruples in aiding in its pursuit. I have been told of their lassoing and tying the crea- ture to a tree to await the arrival of some other person, who, not holding the beast in such high regard, would be willing to kill it. A few tapir hides are used every year at Descalvados for making heavy leathers, but the animal is never sought for food. Tamandua chapadensis Allen. Little Ant-eater. We found the little Ant- eater rather widely distributed, but not common. Two were seen high in the branches of a big piuva tree on January 9, 1926. A male and female were col- lected on May 30th and June 2nd, respectively. These two were both found curled up and asleep in the crowns of small trees Myrmecophaga tridactyla tridactyla (Linne). Giant Ant-eater. Five speci- mens of the giant ant-eater were taken, two males, two females, and a juvenile female about a month old. All were found singly with the exception of a female taken January 2, 1926, which was carrying on her back the juvenile referred to. The youngster had secured a safe position on the back of its mother with its fore legs tightly clasped about her neck and seemed in no way to encumber her actions as she sought to escape in the dense matt. Another female, collected on Decem- ber 6, 1925, contained a single small foetus. Though these ant-eaters seem largely nocturnal, spending the daylight hours hidden away in dense cover of thorny palm and cat-claw, they are great wanderers. Their characteristic trails lead across the grassy savannas from one capon to another, and are a graphic record of their nightly travels. Often in hunting them shortly after daylight we would follow the trail of an individual several hours before coming on it asleep in the thick matt. Curiously, though the ant-eaters have a pronounced scent, dogs will readily pursue them on sight, but will not follow their spoor. When alarmed the ant-eater travels at a clumsy gallop, the big bushy tail being held slightly above the horizontal and swaying loosely from side to side. The fore legs and feet are kept rigid, lending the animal a somewhat mechanical appearance. A male taken December 10, 1925 was badly scarred on one shoulder; the work, so our Indians said, of a jaguar. They also stated that out of respect to the ant- eater's powerful fore claws the jaguar seldom attacks it, and that such encounters often result fatally for both parties. Priodontes giganteus (Desmarest). Giant Armadillo. Occasional unoccupied burrows of this huge armadillo were noted in the general vicinity of the Indian village at Lagoona. On December 13, 1925, a prepared skin was purchased from an Indian who had killed it a few days previously in that locality.
