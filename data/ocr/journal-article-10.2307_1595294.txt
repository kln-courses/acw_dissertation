<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JURIDICAL THEOLOGY A A OF SHAFI'I ORIGINS AND SIGNIFICANCE A OF USUL AL-FIQH There are some problems connected with the history of Islamic jurisprudence, a science which has come down to us under the designation of us.'l al-fiqh, literally, "the roots of law". (*) These problems have to do with its origins, its designation, its constituent elements, and its purpose. The names of several doctors of the law are involved with its origins. No exact date can be assigned to its foundation on the basis of the available data. The designation given to this science belongs to a period which, though it cannot as yet be exactly determined, is nevertheless much later than the first work treating of it, perhaps as much as two centuries. The works on this subject vary considerably in method and content; its authors in the Middle Ages are divided on the matter of its constituent elements; and modern scholars are not in agreement as to its purpose. In the following pages an attempt is made to provide some answers to these problems, answers which, for the time being should be considered, at least in part, as provisional, pending a more elaborate study now in progress. (*) This paper is dedicated to George Hourani, in remembrance of early days at a great institution, the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor); it unfortunately missed the deadline for the Festschrift because of absence in France,</page><page sequence="2">6 GEORGE MAKDISI Founder and Date of Foundation The birth of usdl al-fiqh as the science of jurisprudence in Islam appears to have occurred sometime prior to the death of 'Abd ar-RahmAn ibn Mahdi in 198 of the hijra (A.D. 813-814). Ibn Mahdi is said to have written to ShWfi'i (d. 204/820) asking him to compose a work dealing with the legal statements of the Koran, the accepted historical reports relating to them, the probative value of the consensus, and to clarify the repealing and repealed doctrines of the Koran and the Prophet's Sunna. (1) Shfi'l's Risdla (2) is said to have been written in answer to this request. A jurisconsult is cited as having delivered Shifi'i's Risdla to 'Abd ar-Ralhman. Al-HaIrith b. Suraij an-Naqqal, so-called because of his role as "deliverer" (naqqdl) of the work to the one for whom it was intended, is reported as having said, "when I carried the Risdla to 'Abd ar-Rahman b. Mahdi, he was amazed, and kept saying repeatedly, 'if only it were shorter, so it could be easily understood!' (lau kdna aqalla li-yufham)"-apparently finding the "letter" to be too long. (3) Tradition, especially that of the Shafi'l, Hanbali and Maliki schools of law, has it that Shifi'i is the founder of the science of ugsl al-fiqh. Other jurisconsults are cited either as having founded this science or as having written on it: Ibn Lahf'a (d. 174/790), Abu Yusuf (d. 182/798), and Shaibani (d. 189/805). Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi (d. 463/1071) cites AbA Yeisuf, disciple of Abt I.Ianifa, eponym of the Hanafi school of law, as "the (1) Ibn al-'ImAd, Shadhardt adh-dhahab ft akhbdr man dhahab, 8 vols.

(1) Ibn an-Nadim (fl. 377/ 987) cites Shaibint, disciple of Abu .Hantfa and Abu^ Ycisuf, as having written Kitdb Usal al-fiqh (The Book of U. ll al-fiqh). (2) Subkl cites Abu Yahya as-SajI (d. 307/919) as the author of "a book on fiqh and (its) disputed questions which he entitled 'us.l al-fiqh', in which he took in all the chapters on fiqh, stating that he epitomized it from his great work on the disputed questions (of fiqh), and this epitomy I have in a huge volume". (3) When Ignaz Goldziher cited Shifi't as the founder of u. l al-fiqh, he cautioned in a footnote that ath-Thaurt had said that "Ibn Lahi'a ... is competent in usaul, and we in furT'M". (4) The text of Sufyin ath-Thaurt's statement is: "'inda Ibn Lahi'a al-usal, wa-'indand 'l-fur'"'; literally: "Ibn Laht'a is in possession of the usal, and we are in possession of the fura'"'. (5) The Designation "uslul al-fiqh" Thus the question regarding the founder of the new science cannot be determined on the sole basis of the use of the term "usl al-fiqh". The science was founded long before the term for it was coined. In the period of Shafi'l, and thereafter for a period of a century and a half or two, the term "usil" ("roots") (1) al-Khatib al-BaghdAdt, op. cit., XIV, 245-246; Ibn al-'ImAd, op. cit., I, 301. -In reference to Abf Yisuf, Joseph Schacht has said, "the statement of Khatib BaghdAdt...that Abf Yfsuf was the first to compose books on the theory of law on the basis of the doctrine of Abf .Hantfa, is not confirmed by the old sources and must therefore be regarded with suspicion"; see J.

For example, even as late as the last quarter of the fourth/tenth century, the bibliographer Ibn an-Nadim cited the works of Abfi YOsuf in the following terms: Abfi Ycisuf has the following works on u~sl and amdli (dictations): the book on ritual prayer, the Book on alms-tax, ...(li-Abi Yfsuf mina 'l-kutubu fi 'l-usfli wa 'l-amalt: Kitdb aps-saldt, Kitdb az-zakdt...). (1) It is clear, in this instance, that the term usdl is used in the sense of what came to be called the principles of positive law, furt' al-fiqh, literally: the "branches" of fiqh. Ibn an-Nadim continues as follows: and among those who reported on the authority of Abfi Ycisuf is Mu'alla...; he transmitted his legal thought, his legal principles and his books. (wa-mimman rawd 'an Abi Yasuf, Mu'alla...; rawd 'anha fiqhaha wa-us)laha wa- kulubah.) (2) Here again the term usal is used in the sense of principles, elements, rudiments, maxims, or rules of law. (3) When the term "usil", or "usdl al-fiqh", is found in a title cited by a late biographer for a book by an early author, say of the third or fourth century of the hijra, one cannot be certain that the title is free of anachronism. But even if not anachro- nistic, it may simply mean that the work dealt exclusively with positive law, or with the Koran, the Sunna, consensus (ijmd'), or analogical reasoning (qiyds), that is, with one or another of the sources or "roots" of jurisprudence, not with jurisprudence as a constituted science. As one may determine from the available works on the subject, it is not until the late fourth and early fifth centuries (Xth-XIth A.D.) that the title ugsl al-fiqh begins to designate (1) Ibn an-Nadim, op. cit., p. 286 (1. 10 ff.).

Works of this period (and even later, up to modern times) often include an explanation of this two-word term, each word separately, then the two together. It is significant that this insistence on explaining the two-word term should appear two centuries after Shafi't had written his Risdla which introduced the new science. The explanation was needed in order to distinguish between the science of fiqh and that of ugsl al-fiqh, and thus put an end to the equivocal use of the latter term in the sense of elements or rudiments of fiqh, reserving the two-word term to designate the metho- dology of the revealed Law. It is also significant that the term itself is neither in the title of Shafi'I's work, nor anywhere in the body of the text. The title Risdla, meaning Epistle, Letter, may well be due to its being a letter in answer to the request of Ibn Mahdl asking Shfi'f to write on certain sources of the religion. Ibn Mahdi's amazement at the size of the "letter" would seem to confirm this supposition. There is nothing to show that Shafi'1 himself chose this title for his work; rather he referred to it as "The Book", "My Book", or "Our Book". (') The title Risdla also appears in a statement attributed to Ibn Mahdi: "When I saw the Risdla (=Letter) of Shafi't, it amazed me; for I beheld the words of a wise and eloquent man of good counsel; I shall indeed remember him often in my prayers"! (2) Thus the title Risdla may have been given to Shafi'f's work at an early date, and may simply refer to its being written in answer to the request of Ibn Mahdi. In any case, the science of usil al-fiqh, as we know it since the book of Shafi'l, existed long before the two-word term for it was established. Also, works had been written before Sh&amp;fi'l dealing with one or another of the fundamental sources which, brought together, came to be recognized as the science of usdll al-fiqh, and as founded by ShAfi't.

Shakir does not give his source for Ibn Mahdt's statement.</page><page sequence="6">10 GEORGE MAKDISI Contents and Purpose Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi (d. 606/1209) says that the doctors of law before Shafi't had already dealt with questions of usil al-fiqh, but did not have universal principles to follow regarding those questions; this was what Shafi'f did for them, so that he is to the "science of the revealed law" what Aristotle is to the "science of reason". (1) Two eminent scholars have concerned themselves with Shafi'f's contribution: Ignaz Goldziher and Joseph Schacht. Goldziher's studies led him to the following conclusion in his book on the Zahirl school of law: on account of Abi HIanifa's endeavors on the one hand, but more so because of the force of circumstances, qiyds became a factor in jurisprudence which could no longer be eliminated from the legal sources. Al-Shafi'f had not intended to do this, but even if he had wanted to do so, he would not have been able to achieve anything, as futile attempts of later followers of his school indicate. What he could do, and actually did, was to discipline the application of the newly introduced legal source [i.e. qiyds] without curtailing the prerogatives of the scripture and tradition, and to restrict its free arbitrary application by means of methodical laws with respect to its usage. This is both the purpose and the result of the science of usil al-fiqh which al-Shffi'1 founded and and which is associated with his name. (2) Shafi'i's Risdla had not yet been printed when Goldziher published his book in 1884. (3) He continues his statement saying that if the tract had survived in which al-Shafi'f justified the new discipline which is revolutionary for Islamic jurisprudence, and which, in particular, introduces it to the branches of the sciences, (1) Ibid., p. 13 of Introduction, apud Ibn H.ajar al-'AsqalAnt, Mandqib ash- Shfi't (Cairo: BOflq, 1301/1884), p. 57.

(3) The Risdla was first published in Cairo (Bcildq) in 1321/1903.</page><page sequence="7">THE JURIDICAL THEOLOGY OF SHAFII 11 researchers of the history of Muslim thought would be enabled to determine in every detail al-ShMfi't's position in the controversy of traditionalism versus the partiality of qiyds. (1) Goldziher was interested in drawing attention to Shifi'I's legal doctrine which vindicated the use of hadiths in law. He also brought out Shifi'T's equal concern for the other sources of the law including qiyas, reasoning by analogy. (2) He then showed how the founder of the Zahiri school Dawi^d b. 'Ali, a student of Shafi'I, who, "surpassing all the master's intentions, completely rejected the justification of ra'y and qiyds and all that this implied". (3) Thus Goldziher's interest in Shfi'f's achievement stemmed from a more immediate interest, central to his study of the Zahiri school of law. In his book, which to this day remains a fundamental work for the study of Islamic jurisprudence, Goldziher's purpose was to point out the Zahiri position as representative of the extremist side of traditionalism, issuing from the Shifi'I school. Though Shifi'I is described as the "champion of traditionalism" ("Vindex des Traditionalismus"), his position in relation to his extremist disciple Dawfid (founder of the Zahiri school), was, in contrast, described as concilia- tory. (4) Goldziher, subsequently, came to know of the existence of two manuscript copies of Shifi'I's Risdla, preserved in the National Library in Cairo, Dar al-Kutub. (5) That Goldziher did not pursue the matter of ShAfi't's "new discipline ...revolutionary for Islamic jurisprudence" is an indication of the secondary nature of his interest in Shafi'I and his doctrine, as a point of departure for the Zahiri school which developed into extremist traditionalism.

Schacht's Origins is a work no less fundamental than that of Goldziher, confirming it and going beyond it to do what Goldziher had hoped would be done once Shafi'I's work was found and published. Referring to his own book, Schacht says that it will be found to confirm Goldziher's results and to go beyond them in some respects. Schacht then enumerates these respects, which deal with hadiths and their history and significance in the development of jurisprudence (2). Schacht gives ShAfi'i's personal achievements in legal theory as consisting (1) in the development of a new theory of interpre- tation applied to the two principal sources of the revealed law: the Koran and the Prophetic traditions; (3) (2) in the almost complete identification of Sunna and traditions (hadiths) which later became part of the classical theory of Islamic law; (4) and (3) in the hierarchy of the four sources of law, including consensus and qiyas. (5) In the present study, I propose to deal with what I consider as Shifi'I's chief motivation in writing his Risdla. I hope to show that, by raising the Prophet's Sunna to the level of the Koran, (6) and by restricting the use of analogical reasoning within definite limits, Shdf!'i's purpose was to create for traditio- nalism a science which could be used as an antidote to kalam, another already well-established science associated with the rationalist Mu'tazila, whom he called Ahl al-kalam, (7) "the partisans of philosophical theology", and whom he regarded as his adversaries. Razi chose the correct term to designate the science founded by Shifi'I, 'ilm ash-shar', the science that treats of the revelation, the revealed law; and he contrasts it to 'ilm al-'aql, "the science (1) Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1950.

(1) The task of the Mu'tazila, who later infiltrated the science of usdl al-fiqh, was to show that reason and revelation are not in contradiction. In the fifth/eleventh century this is what we find clearly stated on more that one occasion in the Kitdb al-Fundn of Ibn 'Aql, who was a product of rationalism and traditionalism combined; and later still, in the thirteenth century, we find the same proposition clearly stated in St. Thomas Aquinas's Summa Contra Gentiles. (2) The student of the history of usill al-fiqh is faced with some striking phenomena, of which one will be treated in the present study; namely, the lapse of time between the Risdla's appearance and that of the first independent and comprehensive works, which have come down to us, on the subject of the Risdla, usi.l al-fiqh. We have little or no definite knowledge of the development of this science for two or more centuries after Shifi'1; and what little we can know, or surmise, must be gleaned from available works where the authors have made reference to earlier works. Two late writers (3) give lengthy lists of works on utsl al-fiqh by their predecessors. The lists begin with ShMfi'l's Risdla, followed by its commentaries. Five such commentaries were known to posterity, none of which is extant. The first commen- tator comes well over a century after ShWfi'l; and the last, well over two centuries. (4) The first independent and comprehensive works on us l al-fiqh in these lists are by authors (1) Supra, p. 10. (2) See G.

(1) We do know, however, that many authors treated of usul al-fiqh in the third and fourth centuries (=A.D. ninth and tenth). Many of them are quoted in subsequent works, such as the Musaawada of usIl al-fiqh, by Ibn Taimlya, his father and his grandfather, a "draft" (musauwada) the fair copy of which was made by a student of Ibn Taimiya, all three authors having each in turn made his notes on the subject but died leaving his contribution in draft form. They cite many authors from among the contemporaries of Shffi'i down to the dawning of the fifth/eleventh century, and beyond. (2) There were many writers on usiil al-fiqh, among them jurisconsults who were Mu'tazili and Ash'ari theologians, i.e. mutakallimun, and whose works or ideas were available to the three authors of the Musauwada either directly or through quotation by later authors. A perusal of the great majority of works available to us from the fifth/eleventh century onward on upsl al-fiqh shows that they have definitely deviated from the path taken by ShMfif in his Risdla; and the Musauwada references to the earlier writers show that the deviation was incipient as of the time of Sh1fi' . What was the nature of this deviation? Sh1fi't's work does not treat of a single question or problem of kalam, or even of legal philosophy. Throughout his Risdla, he keeps within the strictly circumscribed field of law, positive law, or legal methodology rooted in the scriptural texts. On the other hand, the first two comprehensive works purporting to be on the science of us~il al-fiqh at the turn of the fourth- fifth/tenth-eleventh century were written by two authors who were philosophical theologians, mutakallimun. Though neither of these two works is extant, one of them has been so well described by its commentator as to leave no doubt that it (1) See below, pp. 30 ff. (2) Ibn Taimlya, et al. (=Majd ad-Din b.

Its author is the celebrated Mu'tazill of the turn of the century, Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar (d. 415/1025). Abut 'l-IHusain al-Basri (d. 436/1044), himself a Mu'tazill also and author of a work on the subject, al-Mu'tamad fi tusdl al-fiqh, wrote a commentary on Qadl 'Abd al-Jabbar's Kitdb al-' Umad. This commentary, like its original, is not extant; but in the introduction to his other independent work on usdl al-fiqh entitled al-Mu'tamad, al-Basri gives the following information regarding the character of 'Abd al-Jabbar's SUmad: What prompted me to compose this book on usdal al-fiqh [i.e. his Mu'tamad], after my commentary on Kitdb al-'Umad and making a thorough study of it, is that I followed the course set out in the book as regards the arrangement of its chapters, repeating many of its questions, and commenting chapters of kalam minutiae inappropriate for uspdl al-fiqh, as for instance the treatment of the divisions of knowledge, the definitions of necessary and acquired knowledge, that philoso- phical speculation produces knowledge and that knowledge does not produce philosophical speculation, and other such matters. The book becomes lengthy with such questions and with the verbatim quotations of the 'Umad and the interpretations of a great part of them. I therefore wanted to compose a book with chapters well-arranged and free from repetition, and in which 1 would avoid treating the minutiae of kalam, improper in a work on usdl al-fiqh; for such matters belong to another science, the mixing of which with this science is unwarranted, even if it should have a remote connection with it. For if the treatment of divine unicity and justice is unwarranted in books on positive law (fiqh),-though the latter is based on them and is closely connected with them-it is all the more unwarranted to deal with these chapters in updl al-fiqh because they are remotely connected with them, and understanding the purpose of the book does not depend on them. Also, if the reader of these chapters in usdAl al-fiqh knows kalam, he has a thorough knowledge of the subject and will derive no</page><page sequence="12">16 GEORGE MAKDISI benefit from these chapters. On the other hand, if he does not know kalam, understanding the subject will be difficult for him, even if I laid it out clearly for him. His annoyance and irritation will be great, for he will have given his attention and spent his time on something hard for him to understand, and which does not help him to reach his goal. It would therefore be preferable to omit these chapters from usil al-fiqh. (1) But most books on usal al-fiqh do, in fact, treat also of problems which are not properly those of us.l al-fiqh but rather of kalam and legal philosophy. The following problems belong to these two fields: (1) the problem of the determination of good and evil (at-tahsin wa't-taqbih.); (2) the relation between reason and revelation (al-'aql wa'sh-shar'); (3) the qualifications of acts before the advent of revelation (hukm al-af'dl qabl wurid ash-shar'); (4) prohibition and permission (al-hazr wa'l-ibdha); (5) the imposition of responsibility or obligation beyond one's capacity (laklif mnd 16 yutldq); and (6) the imposition of legal obligation on the non-existent (mas'alal al-ma'dmn). None of these problems is found in Shifi'I's Risdla. Schacht pointed out that Shafiei does not consider the question with which legal philosophy is concerned, namely, "Whether every act is to be regarded as allowed on principle, unless it is specifi- cally forbidden, or as forbidden on principle unless it is specifi- cally allowed." (2) Where Shafi'i discusses in his Risdla the relationship between the categories allowed and forbidden, Schacht points out that "he keeps his feet firmly planted on positive law".

The celebrated al-GhazzMAl, a Shafi'l jurisconsult, deals at length with the inroads made by other sciences into the field of us.ll al-fiqh. What he has to say on this matter in the Introduction to his work, al-Mustasfd min 'ilm al-utsul, is illuminating and deserves to be quoted here. Ghazz li points out that works on ugsul al-fiqh are often loaded with too much fiqh, or kalam, or grammar, depending on the special interest of the author. Then he says, addressing the reader, and after having told you of their excesses in this kind of mixing [of the sciences], it is nevertheless not our opinion that we should keep this work free from mixture; because weaning from what is familiar is hard to take, and minds turn away from the unusual.

(5) Why this change in the character of usal al-fiqh as founded by Sh fi'l? This legal science which, at the outset, was purely traditionalist, devoid not only of philosophical kalam, but even of all questions of legal philosophy, is found, by the beginning of the fifth/eleventh century, to be mixed with topics properly belonging to kalam, and authored by mutakallimun, members of that movement held in abhorrence by Sh fi'I: "There is (1) See infra, p. 35, 42-44.

(1) An answer to the above question must be sought in the history of the intervening centuries-three century beginnings, each of which brought its own important event: an inquisition, a defection, and a declaration of faith-three significant landmarks in Islamic religious history. Three Landmarks of the Intervening Centuries 1. The Inquisition It will be remembered that the Great Inquisition (Mihna) was begun under the Caliphate of al-Ma'miin and continued under the following three caliphs, al-Mu'tasim, al-Wathiq and al-Mutawakkil. It lasted some fifteen years, from 218 to 233 (833 to 848 of our era). When it ended in the second year of Mutawakkil's Caliphate, its termination was to the detriment of the Mu'tazila. At the end of the first third of this century, corresponding to the middle of the ninth century A.D., the Traditionalist movement emerged triumphant over Mu'tazili rationalism, under the banner of the Inquisition's surviving hero Ahmad b. IHanbal. If we consider Shfif''s career as one of triumph over the rationalism of his day, in that he was the successful champion of traditionalism, then Ahmad b. Hanbal's triumph did not signal the first, but rather the second defeat of rationalism. Between these two defeats, Mu'tazilism had harnessed all its strength with a view to crushing the stubborn resistance of the Traditionalists. Mu'tazilism, in this period, had the support of the secular arm through three caliphates and the initial part of the fourth, when Mutawakkil, deserting this Rationalist movement as a lost cause, opted opportunistically for its adversaries. The Mu'tazila were finished in the political (1) Ibn al-'ImAd, Shadhardt, II, 9, apud al-'Ibar of Dhahabt. For other like statements, see Ibn QudAma, Tahrtm an-nazar ft kutub ahl al-kaldm, in G.

The Defection Ash'art defected from Mu'tazilism and joined the Traditio- nalist camp. In his Ibdna, said to be his last book, he placed himself under the banner of Ahmad b. IHanbal: The belief we hold and the religion we follow are holding fast to the Book of our Lord, to the sunnah of our Prophet, and to the traditions related on the authority of the Compa- nions and the Successors and the imdms of the hadif;-to that we hold firmly, professing what Abu 'Abdallah Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn IHanbal professed, and avoiding him who dissents from his belief, because he is the excellent imdm and the perfect leader, through whom God declared the truth, removed error, manifested the modes of action, and overcame the innovations of the innovators, the deviation of the deviators, and the skepticism of the skeptics. (1) Ash'arl was later to be used by his followers to defend him, as proof of his Traditionalist creed, against those who accused him of being a Rationalist. Ash'arl's sensational defection was another triumph for Traditionalism at the expense of the Mu'tazila. Other triumphs were in store for Traditionalism during this century. Such, for instance, was the trial of Ibn Shannabddh whose teaching of the aberrant variants of the Koran almost cost him his life. To save it, he signed a retraction abjurring his aberrant readings. It will be remembered that the Mu'tazilis, in the previous century, had sought to force upon the Traditio- nalists the doctrine of the "createdness" of the Koran. They lost their cause. Had they won it, Ibn Shannabidh would not have had to retract his readings. That he was forced to (1) Al-Ash'art, Kitdb al-Ibdna 'an us.Il ad-diydna (Cairo, 1348/1929-30), pp. 8-9; English translation by W. C.

(1) This fourth/tenth century is recorded as the century that saw the spread of Shifi'I law throughout the world of Islam. It is also the century of the development of usdl al-fiqh on the basis of the fully-developed art of disputation (munadzara). (2) As for hadith, Schacht has already shown the importance given to it by Shifi'i in his doctrine where it becomes synonymous with the Sunna. With Shifi't, it is from the hadith that fiqh develops along lines differentiating it from that previously developed in the doctrine of AbA I.Hanifa and his successors. The development of fiqh is subsequently enhanced by the introduction of dialectic to deal with the disputed questions (khildf), raising legal disputation to an art. In the circles of jurisprudence, 'ilm, knowledge, learning, becomes synony- mous with flqh and legal studies generally. When in the fifth/eleventh century, the Shifi'i jurisconsult, Abc^ IshIq ash-Shtrizi writes his Who's Who among jurisprudents, (3) his declared purpose is to show the lines of authority in the field of law. He does this by tracing the transmission of authoritative knowledge from the Prophet himself, as the first mufti-jurisconsult, down to the author's day, showing the chains of authority, isndd, across the generations, to drive home the idea that hadith and law, not kalam or falsafa (philosophy), have their origins with the Prophet. And to show that Shifi't, and not Abc I.Iantfa, is the true champion of the Prophet's Sunna, Shirazt relates two anecdotes involving dreams wherein the Prophet was seen and asked whether the personal opinion (ra'y) of AbA IjHantfa, or that of Shifi'i, should be followed. The Prophet's answer on both occasions was this, in substance: "Follow whatever there is in the personal (1) On Ibn Shannabcidh (d. 328/940), see al-Khatib al-Baghdddt, op. cit., I, 280-281; Ibn al-Jauzt, al-Muntaram ft tdrikh al-mulu'k wa 'l-umam, 6 vols.

(1) The fourth/tenth century witnessed also the development of the masjid-colleges as colleges of law with khans built for them as dormitories for the students of law, supported financially by charitable trusts (waqfs). The waqf was used as a weapon by the traditionalist jurisconsults to exclude from the curricu- lum the "foreign sciences in general, and kalam in particular." (2) These endowed colleges were founded on a private financial base, free of government interference; for any Muslim who had the means could create a foundation beyond the reach of the governing power. Indeed the governing power curried the favor of the ulama by founding colleges for them, in order to influence the masses who were partisans of the ulama. The examples of Badr b. I.Iasanawaih in the fourth/tenth century and Nizam al-Mulk in the fifth/eleventh, building networks of colleges, are ample proof of the influence of the jurisconsults in a society where the shar', the revealed law, reigned supreme; a revealed law whose primacy was fought for and won by Shafi'l, then by Ibn .IHanbal. But this fourth/tenth century was also witness to the emer- gence of a new rationalist movement, called Ash'arism, bearing only a nominal relationship to the professed traditionalist position of its eponym, Ash'arl. It was a movement meant to be moderate, in contradistinction to Mu'tazilism's extreme rationalism. There is no way to tell at present when exactly this movement emerged; but after the turn of the century we find the new movement at grips, not only with the traditionalist movement to whose camp Ash'arl had defected, but also with Mu'tazilism. The chronicles of later historians presented these struggles not under their designation as theological move- ments, and therefore as Mu'tazilis versus Ash'ars, or Traditio- nalists (Ahl al-IHadith) versus Ash'arls, but rather under the designation of their affiliation in the schools of law, and therefore (1) ShtrAzt, Tabaqdl al-fuqahd', pp. 86 and 87. (2) See G. Makdisi, Rise of Colleges, pp. 77 ft,</page><page sequence="18">22 GEORGE MAKDISI as Hanafi against Shafi'l, or Hanbali against Shificl; designations which, for a long time, threw historians far off the track, and left the new version of Ash'arism under cover of the Shifi'i affiliation. (1) For it was at this time that the new theological movement was making its bid for legitimacy in the only way it could hope to obtain it: by gaining admission into one of the schools of law. Mu'tazilism had already infiltrated the Hanafi school; and by a system of elimination it becomes clear that the only home left for the new Ash'arism was the ShWfi't school. (2) There are some signs that Mu'tazilism hoped also to gain a foothold in the Shafi't school, and Ash'arism in the Hanafi school, but either combination was of rare occurrence as illustrated by the case of Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar (d. 415/1024) as a Shafi'1-Mu'tazili, and the rarer case of Abui Ja'far as-Simanant (d. 444/1052) as a Hanafi-Ash'arI. 3. The Declaration of Faith It was at the beginning of the fifth/eleventh century that things came to a head, culminating in the promulgation of the traditionalist creed by the Caliph al-Qadir, whence its designa- tion as the Qadiri Creed, a manifesto of resurgent traditionalism condemning all deviations from traditionalist teachings. (3) Looking back on this century, the traditionalist Shifi'f historian Shams ad-Din adh-Dhahabi (d. 748/1347) drew up a list of the top men who died in the first years of the century, a list that calls for close scrutiny. It is found in the biographical notice of the Caliph al-Qadir who died in 422/1031. We owe (1) For an example of such mixing, see C. Snouck Hurgronje, "Le droit musul- man", in Selected Works of C.

Darraj; the head of the calligraphers, Ibn al-Bauwab [d. 413/1022]; the head of kings, the Sultan MalhmOd b. Sabuktakln [d. 421/ 1030]. (2) Dhahabl's list consists of leaders who died in the first part of the fifth/eleventh century. 1 have divided it into two parts because I believe that these leaders represent for Dhahabl two distinct groups, the first of which he holds in contempt, distinct from the second, which he respects. It will be noticed that the leaders named in the first group are cited according to their affiliation to rationalist movements. Dhahabl was a Shifi't traditionalist. The leaders named in the second group are cited as leaders in the Islamic sciences and their ancillaries that Dhahabl held in respect, as he did the last-named person, the Sultan Mahmcid b. Sabuktakin, who had vigorously implemented, in the lands under his sway, the traditionalist policies of the Caliph al-Qadir. (3) But most significant in this list is the conspicuous absence of the legal sciences, fiqh and us. l al-fiqh. Nor are these two fields cited in the supplementary list of SuyctA.

As previously mentioned, the fourth/tenth century was the century of the colleges of law, the century in which dialectic, and the la'liqa were developed in legal studies, leading to the writing of the great summae. (1) The second half of the century was thus taken up with the rise of legal studies and the institutions in which they were taught. How then could Dhahabt, author of the monumental History of Islam, (2) fail to mention the leading scholars of the legal sciences, fiqh and us.l al-fiqh? The answer, I believe, is that Dhahabf did in fact mention these scholars, but did not mention the legal scholarship for which they were only too well-known. He preferred to bring out their rationalist affiliations which could otherwise be overlooked, but which he wanted to dramatize. The first two scholars listed were leading scholars in flqh and us.l al-fiqh; but Dhahabt preferred to cast light on their affiliations with the Ash'arl and Mu'tazili rationalist movements respectively, as scholars of rationalist kalam. Both belonged to the Shafi'l school of law, as Dhahabl did. But Dhahabl belonged to the opposing camp of Shifi'i traditionalism. Dhahabl knew that Abci IsIhq Isfara'inl, the first-named in the list, was a leading scholar in fiqh and us~il al-fiqh, one of the greatest jurisconsults of the Shifi't school in his day. There were others that Dhahabi could have listed instead of AbUi Is1hq al-Isfara'ini; he could have listed a traditionalist Shifi'I, AbQ HIamid al-Isfara'int, who had died in 406/1016, and he could have cited him as top man in fiqh and usl al-fiqh, closer than Abfi Ish~aq to the beginning of the century; but he did not mention him at all. Why this omission? It certainly al-Jauhart (d. 398/1003); the head of the grammarians, Ibn Jinni (d. 392/1002); the head of the rhetoricians, Badf' az-ZamAn al-HamadhAnt (d. 398/1008); the head of the orators, Ibn NubAta (d. 405/1016); the head of the Koranic exegetes, al-.Hasan b. .Iabtb an-NisAbfirl (d. 406/1016); and the head of the Caliphs, al-QAdir (d. 422/ 1031), considered by Ibn as-*alAh as a Shafl'I doctor of the law. (1) See Rise of Colleges, pp. 111 ff., 245 ff. (2) This work is still in manuscript.</page><page sequence="21">THE JUDIRICAL THEOLOGY OF SHAFI 25 could not have been because Dhahabl did not know Abu Hamid or appreciate his title to fame; for he devoted a biographical notice to him in his 'Ibar in which he said of him: "...the juris- consult, Master-Professor of 'Iraq (=Baghdad), Leader of the Sh4fi1'ts, the man in whom the leadership of the Shafi't school of law wound up" (al-faqih, Shaikh al-'Irdq, wa-Imdm ash- Shdfi'tya, wa-man ilaiht 'niahat riydsalu 'l-madhhab). (1) In this notice, Dhahabl then went on to speak in very appreciative terms of Abt I.Hamid as the most successful master-jurisconsult of his day who had covered the earth with his disciples (!abbaqa 'l-arda bi'l-ashdb), and who had composed a lta'lqa(2) of approximately fifty bound volumes, and his course on law was attended by seven hundred students of law (wa-la'ltqatuha ft nahwi khamsina mujalladan, wa-kdna yahduru darsaha sab'u mi'ati faqth). (3) Thus Dhahabl not only knew of Ab t HIImid, he in fact had the highest regard for him as the leading jurisconsult of his day. It might be thought that Dhahabi was interested in citing a leading Ash'art, and AbI HkImid was not an Ash'art. But here again Dhahabl chose Abu Ish.q as an Ash'arI, rather than al-Baqillant, who had died in 403/1013, whom he held in very high regard, pointing out that he had a great study circle (halqa) in the Great Mosque of al-Mans.ir in Baghdad. (4) Dhahabl was also no doubt aware of the high regard that his own professor, the famous Hanbali Ibn Taimlya, had for Baqillant, saying that he was "the most excellent of Ash'art kalam-theologians among whom there is no one like him either among his predecessors or successors" (huwa afdalu '1-mulakallimina 'l-muntasibina ild 'I-Ash'art, laisa fihim mithluhd 1I qablah wa-ld ba'dah). (5) Ibn Taimlya went on to cite passages from Baqillant's Kitdb al-Ibdna showing approval of the way he treated anthropomorphic passages in the Koran according to the doctrine of "bild kaif".

But he does not seem to have devoted a biographical notice to Abus Isthq al-Isfara'int, if we are to judge by the fact that Ibn al-'Imad did not quote the 'Ibar when treating of Abct Ishaq, whereas he did so in the two other cases, and it was his habit to rely on the 'Ibar. Nor did Ibn al-'Imid quote from the 'Ibar regarding the Mu'tazili 'Abd al-Jabbar. If these two kalam-theologians were treated in the 'Ibar, their notices could not have been such as to warrant their being quoted by Ibn al-'Imid; and they were probably very brief. It should also be noted that Dhahabi cited them along with the head of the Rafiida and the head of the Karrimiya, both movements, like Mu'tazilism and Ash'arism, hostile to Sunni Traditionalism; moreover both Abi' IsIhq and 'Abd al-Jabbar were, like Dhahabt, members of the Shifi'I school of law. I would venture to say that Dhahabi listed the first four names in the order in which he held them in contempt, the first scholar all the more so for contaminating the Shafi'i school with the new brand of Ash'arism, more dangerous in its dissimu- lation than Mu'tazilism, the well-known old enemy, represented by the second scholar in the list. Thus indications are that Dhahabi wished to point out that the legal sciences at the head of the fifth/eleventh century were contaminated not only with the kalam-theology of Mu'tazilism, but also with that of the new brand of Ash'arism. Traditiona- list jurisconsults among the Shhfi'l's, the Hanbalis and even the Hanafis, were well aware of this development which they dreaded. Kalam-theology, banned from the curriculum, had infiltrated into the science of jurisprudence, us.ll al-fiqh, a rationalist accomplishment of far-reaching effect. This reli- gious science founded by Shafi'l as a vindication of traditiona- lism was now shot through with rationalist kalam. Us.il al-fiqh came to be written (and later categorized) according to two methods: "the method of the jurisconsults" (tariqat al-fuqahd'), and "the method of the kalam-theologians" (tariqat al-mutakallimin). The intrusion of rationalist, philosophical</page><page sequence="23">THE JURIDICAL THEOLOGY OF SHA^FIi 27 theology into jurisprudence had already taken place by the end of the fourth and beginning of the fifth centuries, and the traditionalist master-j urisconsult Abfi IHamid al-Isfar&amp;'inl was up in arms against it. Regarding the reactions of this and other traditionalist Shifi'i's, we have the statement of Ibn Taimlya (d. 728/1328), Dhahabl's professor of hadith: The severity of Abu I.Hamid (al-Isfara'inl) against the rationa- listic theologians is well-known. He went so far as to make a distinction between ash-Shafi'l's upsl al-fiqh and that of al-Ash'arl. This distinction was noted by the leading scholar Abu^ Bakr ar-Radhakant whose la'liqa I have. It was the example of ar-Radhakant that Professor Abu^ IshIq ash-Shirazl followed in his two books, al-Luma' (1) and al-Tabsira (2). Even when the the doctrine of al-Ash'arl agreed with that of the Shafi's, he maintained the distinction between them, saying, "this is the opinion of our (Shafi't) colleagues, and it was also professed by the Ash'aris", thus avoiding to count them among the followers of ash-ShMfi'. The ShMfi's washed their hands of the Ash'aris and of their doctrines in their methodology of the law (usdl al-fiqh), let alone the fundamental principles of religion (upsl ad-din) ! (3) In the light of the foregoing facts and statements, the stipula- tions of the waqf deed of the Nizamiya College of ShMfi' law in Baghdad take on new significance. AbO IshIq ash-ShirazI (d. 476/1083), mentioned above in Ibn Taimlya's statement, was the first incumbent of the professorship of law in Baghdad's Nizamlya College, and Nizam al-Mulk had said that he founded his college for ShirazI. (4) The waqf deed for Nizam's Shafi't College stipulated that certain posts were to be held by men who were ShMfil's not only in the field of fiqh, but also in that (1) Cairo: Subaih Press, 1347/1928. (2) This is the title the author himself gives to this work written after al-Luma' (rather than at-Tabsira fi usdl al-flqh as in the ms. copy of the Azhar Library in Cairo, call no. usil al-fiqh 1785; see his al-Luma', p. 2 (1. 5).

This was the case for the professor of law, the preacher of the academic sermon, and the librarian. (1) That Nizam al-Mulk wished his college to be Shafi'l is no cause for surprise; it was his privilege as founder (wdqif) of the college. What does call for surprise, however, is the stipula- tion's specific mention of not only fiqh, but also of ugs.l al-fiqh, as the two elements necessary for consideration of appointment to certain positions in the college. To say that the professor of law, for instance, must be Shafi'I in fiqh, is merely to be redundant; for to say "Shafi'" is to say "Shifi' fiqh". But to (1) See Ibn al-Jauzt, Muntazam, IX, 66; G. Makdisi, "Muslim Institutions of Learning in Eleventh-Century Baghdad" in BSOAS, 24 (1961), pp. 1-56, esp. p. 37. The biographical notice devoted to the grammarian al-MubArak al-WAsitt, known as al-Wajth b. ad-DahhAn (d. 612/1215) in al-Qifti's Inbdh ar-ruwdh states that this grammarian, first a Hanbali, changed over to the Hanafl school of law, then changed to the Shdfl't school when he was appointed grammarian to the NigAmtya "because of the stipulation of its founder that the grammarian of the NizAmtya be a Shfi't". (See al-Qiftf, Inbdh ar-ruwdh 'ald anbdh an-nuhdh, 3 vols. (Cairo: DAr al-Kutub Press, 1369-74/1950-55 III, 155; and Shadhardt, V, 53). Such was not the case with al-Jaw~ltqt, nor is there a stipulation to this effect in the waqf deed of the NizAmlya. If the information is correct, both as to the stipulation and as to the appointment of al-WAsitt being contingent upon his becoming a ShAfl't, then it would seem that this part of the waqf deed at least had become unknown, for some reason (e.g., loss of the waqf instrument), and the appointment of the grammarian was assumed to be restricted by the same stipulation as for the professor of law, the preacher of the academic sermon and the librarian. Nothing in the sources indicates that al-Jaw~ltqt changed over to Shafl'i membership; more- over, the biographer of the Hanbali school Ibn Rajab devotes a biographical notice to him as a Hanbali, whereas he omits al-WAsitt who had changed over from the Hanbali school of law. The stipulations read as follows: (1) The Nizamiya constitutes an endowment for the benefit of members of the Shdfl't school of law who are Shdfl't in both flqh and usll al-flqh. (2) The possessions with which the Nizamiya is endowed are also for the benefit of those who are Shdfl't in both flqh and ugsl al-fiqh. (3) The following members of the teaching staff must be Shafl't in both fiqh and usl.i al-fiqh: (a) the professor of law (mudarris, incumbent of the chair of law); (b) the preacher (wd'i;; preacher of the academic sermon); (c) the librarian (mutawallt '1-kutub). (4) The Nizmtlya must also have a teacher of Koranic science to teach the Koran (muqri').

On the other hand, the Koranic Reader and the grammarian are not restricted by this stipulation. The grammarian and philologist al-Jawdltqt (d. 540/1145) was a member of the Hanbali school of law who held the post of grammarian in the Nizgmlya, succeeding his teacher at-Tabrtzt (d. 502/1109).</page><page sequence="25">THE JURIDICAL THEOLOGY OF SHAFI1i 29 add ups.l al-fiqh to the stipulation is to indicate that this science could be other than what Shafi'l himself had intended it to be; that it could be a Rationalist ugs'l al-fiqh, and particularly, an Ash'ari uspdl al-fiqh to which Professor ShirAiz, the one for whom NizAm founded his College, (1) was clearly and definitely opposed. Ab^ Ishaq ash-ShirazW was known to be anti-Ash'ari in usdl al-fiqh, a fact to which we have his own quoted statement, and his books: "These are my books on us.l al-fiqh wherein I profess doctrines opposed to those of the Ash'aris". (2) Of Shirazl's works on usu'l al-fiqh, al-Luma' fi usdl al-fiqh has been published; it contains a number of statements of doctrine opposed to the Ash'aris and confirming Ibn Rajab's quotation. (3) The stipulation of Shafi'l us.l al-fiqh is clearly in consonance with the doctrine of ShirAzl in that field. But the designation of usdl al-fiqh as "Shafi'l" should not be taken to mean that each of the schools of law had its own variety of us.l al-fiqh, so that one could expect four varieties of this religious science, one for each of the four Sunni schools of law. This field does not lend itself to this kind of categorization. "Shafi'l usdI al-fiqh" designates the usal al-fiqh of Shafie' himself, followed by the Traditionalists of all the schools of law. The QAdirt creed (al-I'tiqdd al-Qddiri), which comes to our notice for the first time only in the year 431 or 432H., had long been in the making. It was the result of a series of Epistles promulgated by the Caliph al-QAdir, beginning with the years 408/1017, and 409/1018. The Creed itself and its significance have been treated elsewhere.

Such is its negative aspect. Its positive aspect is its definition of upsdl ad-din as the fundamental articles of belief, distinguishing it from those of the philosophical theologians. This Creed goes hand in hand with the banning of kalam-theology as a subject of study in the curriculum of the colleges of law, indeed in all institutions of learning based on waqf. Morever, there is a significant correlation between the Qadirl Creed and Dhahabl's list of leading scholars at the head of the fifth/eleventh century, a list preserved in the biographical notice of the Caliph who promulgated that Creed.

The first independent and comprehensive work on us.dl al-fiqh, after that of Shafi'f, that has come down to us and is now in print, is the Mu'tamad of Abui 'l-.IHusain al-BasrI, a Mu'tazili, whose intro- duction, as already mentioned, tells us about the character of 'Abd al-Jabbar's work entitled al-'Umad, not extant. Henceforth works on this subject deal also with problems properly belonging to philosophical theology and/or legal philosophy. This phenomenon was so widespread in the fifth/eleventh century and thereafter that voices were raised in condemnation of the practice. Ghazz la, in his Mustasfd, gives a brief classification of the sciences in order to show where ugs.l al-fiqh belongs: The sciences are divided into the rational sciences, such as medicine, arithmetic, geometry,-but that does not concern us,-and into the religious sciences, such as kalam, fiqh and its usSl, the science of hadith, the science of exegesis, and the esoteric science, I mean the science of the heart and its purification from reprehensible dispositions (sufi mystificism). Each of the two divisions of knowledge is further divided into universal and particular sciences. The universal science of the religious sciences is kalam. The rest of these sciences, namely fiqh, its usal, hadith, and exegesis, are sciences of the particular; for the exegete studies only the meaning of the Book in particular; the muhaddith studies only the method of establishing the authenticity of the hadith in particular; the faqth studies only the qualifications of the acts of persons with legal capacity in particular; the usali studies only the sources of the legal qualifications in particular; but the mutakallim is the person who studies the most general of 3</page><page sequence="30">34 GEORGE MAKDISI things, namely, the existent. He first divides the existent into eternal and adventious, then the adventitious into substance and accident, then the accident into that for which life is made a condition, namely knowledge, will, power, hearing, sight... Such is the content of the science of kalam. From this you know that it begins with the most general of things, the existent, then it descends gradually to the details we have mentioned establishing the first principles of the rest of the religious sciences; namely the Book, the Sunna, and the veracity of the Prophet. Then, from the totality of subjects studied by the mutakallim, the exegete takes one in particular, the Book, and studies its meaning; the muhaddith takes one in particular, the Sunna, and studies the methods of establis- hing its authenticity; the faqih takes one in particular, the act of the person with legal capacity, and studies its relation to the statement of the revealed law as regards the qualifica- tions of the obligatory, the prohibited and the indifferent; and the us.ali takes one in particular, the statement of the Prophet whose veracity was proved by the mutakallim, and he studies the manner in which it furnishes evidence for the legal qualifications, either through the letter of the text, or its implicit meaning, or systematic reasoning and deduction. The usuli's investigation does not go beyond the word and deed of the Prophet: for he receives the Book from the Prophet's utterance; and consensus is established through the Prophet's utterance; and the sources are the Book, the Sunna and consensus only; and the veracity of the Prophet's speech and its validity as proof is established only through the science of kalam. Therefore kalam is the guarantor of the authenticity of the first principles of the religious sciences, and they are subordinate in relation to kalam. (1) These pains taken to delimit the subject matter of us~l al-fiqh point to differences of opinion as to content, and are evidence of attempts to keep extraneous matter from being (1) Mustasfd, I, 5 and 6.</page><page sequence="31">THE JURIDICAL THEOLOGY OF SHAFI i 35 mixed in with the science. But these attempts did not prove successful; for even the traditionalist authors found themselves forced to deal with certain questions not treated by Shifi't in the Risdla,--questions of legal philosophy, the most frequen- tly treated being "al-a'ydn wa'l-af'dl qabl wuridd ash-shar'" (the qualifications given to things and acts before the advent of revelation). This points to the source of obligation before God revealed the Law, and calls for a discussion of the function of reason. After delimiting the science of usdCl al-fiqh, GhazzalI, as already pointed out, does not follow his own classification, but decides instead to do as his predecessors did, "because weaning from what is familiar is hard to take, and minds turn away from the unusual." (1) Before Ghazzlt, Sam'anI had already criticized the mixing of kalam with ugsul al-fiqh, in his Qawdi.i al-adilla. This work was described by Subkl as "the most beneficial book on usdl for the Shifi'ts and the most significant" (huwa anfa'u kildbin ii 'sh-shdfi'iya ft 'l-us.l wa-ajalluh); (2) and after Subki, Zarkashl described it as "the most significant work for the Shafi'ls in u1al al-fiqh in its reference to sources and its argumentation" (huwa ajallu kildbin li'sh-shdfi'iya fi usal al-fiqh naqlan wa- hijdjan). (3) It will be remembered that Abet 'l-Muzaffar as-Sam'ani was a jurisconsult in the Hanafi school of law for thirty years before transferring to the Shifi't school, amid much criticism from former colleagues and to the general delight of the Shafi'fs. Sam'ani begins by pointing out that the science of fiqh is the most important and most noble of the sciences, because it treats of the ever-changing events to which there is no limit, and consequently no limit or way of encompassing the know- ledge of the laws to be applied to these events. On the other hand, theology, which Sam'ant does not call kalam, but rather "the science of the fundamental principles regarding acts of (1) Musiasfd, I, 10. (2) Subklt, op. cit., fol. 2a (1. 19).

On the other hand, fiqh is an on-going science continuing with the passage of centuries and changing with the change of circumstances and conditions of men, without end or interruption. Indeed God made the ijtihdd of the jurisconsult regarding these events to take the place of inspiration in the time of the Prophets. When this time passed God made ijlihdad to take the place of the Prophet's inspiration so that a clarification of God's laws would issue from it. (1) Sam'nt then comes to deal with the works on usul al-fiqh: I have not ceased throughout my life to study the works of colleagues and others on this subject. I noticed that most of them have contented themselves with a superficial study of the subject rather than delve deeply into its themes. And I noticed that one of them dug deep, analyzed and blended, but he deviated from the method of the jurisconsults in many of the questions, and followed the method of the mulakallimun who are but strangers to jurisprudence and its themes; nay, they are completely ignorant of this science. (2) For Abc^ Bakr as-Samarqandi (d. 540/1145), a hanafi juris- consult, author of Mizdn al-usul, the science of usul al-fiqh branches off from that of kalam; and the branch is what branches off from a root, and what does not branch off from the root is not of its progeny. It was therefore inevitable that writing books on this subject should follow the creed of the author of the book. Now most of the works on ugsul al-fiqh belong to the Mu'tazilis who oppose us in the fundamentals of religion, and to the Traditionalists who oppose us in the applied derivatives.

To guard against both pitfalls is a matter of obligation according to both reason and revelation. (1) A return to upsdl al-fiqh as founded by Shifi'l is advocated in the work of the Shafi'l jurisconsult and historian, Abus Shama (2) (d. 665/1267). It is interesting to see the difference between this Shafi'f jurisconsult and his predecessor GhazzAlI, also a Shafi't jurisconsult, on the subject of the classification of the sciences and the place of uadl al-fiqh in this classification. For AbO Shima, like Shifi'l himself, does not have any place in his classification for the science of kalam, as such, let alone classifying it as the fountainhead of all the Islamic sciences, including usdl al-flqh. Abcs ShAma divides the Islamic religious sciences into two categories: (1) the science of the Koran, 'ilm al-kildb, and (2) the science of the Sunna, 'ilm as-sunna. From these two major categories and through the Arabic literary arts, 'ilm al-'arablya, two other major categories of sciences are derived: (1) the science of the fundamental principles of religion and law, 'ilm al-updl, i.e. usdl ad-din and usdl al-fiqh; and (2) the science derivative of the fundamental principles, 'ilm al-furd', consisting of (a) the science of the practical applications of religion and law that are to be followed, 'ilm al-madhhab, and (b) the science of right behavior, truth, and etiquette of the followers of the Right Way ('ilm al-mu'amala wa'l-haqlqa wa-adab ahl at-tarlqa), i.e. Sufism. After discussing what is most important in the study of the Koran and Sunna, and what fields of knowledge constitute the literary arts, Abui Shima deals with 'ilm al-usdil: (1) Samarqandt, Mtzdn al-usdl, MS. 1626, Garrett Collection (Princeton University); cited also in I;IAjji Khaltfa, Kashf a;-;undn 'an asdmt 'l-kutub wa 'I-fundn, 2 vols.

Many things have been added to each of the two sciences, as well as distressing studies belonging to the science of kalam and the pseudo-arguments of the practi- tioners of quarrelsome argument and controversy [i.e. the mutakallimun]. It is more fitting for one whose faith is sound and whose proof is manifest not to lose his time on these things. There are those who have been put up to it, or in whose hearts there is hypocrisy, (1) who have smuggled into these sciences harmful and reprehensible things from the abominable sciences of the Ancients [i.e. the Greeks], so that he who devotes himself to the study of these sciences hides behind these fundamental principles of religion; but he is to be censured. (2) Thus Abc^ Shima, parting company with his fellow-Shifi'l, Ghazzali, condemns kalam and its practitioners outright, excluding it, along with the "sciences of the Ancients" from the classification of the Islamic sciences. (3) The Shifi't jurisconsult and theologian, Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi, in his Mahs. l, declared that "the most important science for the mujtahid is usul al-fiqh, the rest of the sciences being of no importance for his purposes. As for kalam, it is of no account in the matter". (4) The Shifi'i jurisconsult and historian of (1) Koran II, 9: man ft qalbiht marad; cf. Lane, Lexicon, s.v. marad.

(1) Razi's position is all the more significant since he was an Ash'ari theologian of kalam, and influenced by Mu'tazili kalam to boot. (2) And Isnawl follows his example, excluding both fiqh and kalam from usCtl al-fiqh. On the other hand, Zarkashl deals with the question of the subject-matter of upsil by avoiding to give a full answer to the question posed: If someone should say: "Is the science of usil al-fiqh anything but parts assembled from a miscellany of sciences, partly from the science of kalam..., partly from philology..., and partly from the science of hadith...? A scholar knowing these sciences needs none of this from usll al-fiqh. On the other hand, he who has no knowledge of these sciences will not be dispensed by upsl al-fiqh from the need of acquiring them. Thus, of usill al-fiqh proper all that remains is the treatment of consensus (ijmd'), reasoning by analogy (qiyds), disputation (la'drud) and ijlihdd; but even here, some of the discussion regarding consensus belongs also to the science of the fundamentals of religion (usdll ad-din), and some discussion regarding reasoning by analogy and disputation belongs solely to the adept of positive law (al-faqih). Under the circumstances, the value of uisdl al-fiqh is rather limited." The answer to this thesis is to deny it. The scholars of u1il al-fiqh have made a close study of certain matters in the language of the Arabs not achieved either by the grammarians or the philologists...

He offers no explana- tion for the two other fields: hadith, and especially kalam, which latter is precisely the source of the controversy. With Zarkashl (d. 794/1392) we come to the end of the eighth/fourteenth century, some six centuries after Shifi'I's Risdla was delivered to Ibn Mahdl (d. 198/813-814), and the discussion as to the nature, contents and purpose of what came to be called us.l al-flqh, the fundamentals of law, has not abated. CONCLUSION ShifiT''s science of jurisprudence has two dimensions: one legal, the other theological. So far, scholars have concentrated on the legal dimension. Ignaz Goldziher was the first to draw attention to it, seeing ShAfiI''s purpose as consisting in the disciplined application of qiyas as a legal source. Goldziher was not interested primarily in Shifi"'ts contribution; for him, Shifi'I was simply a point of reference for the Zahiri school of law, an aberrant offshoot of the Shafi1' school denying the use of qiyas altogether. He nonetheless pointed out the value of studying Shafi'ts work if and when it is found. On the other hand, Joseph Schacht, chiefly interested in Shifi'I, and taking his lead from Goldziher's suggestion, made a detailed study of Shifi'ts contribution to legal science, characterizing it as "a magnificently consistent system and superior by far to the doctrines of the ancient schools" of law. (1) While the legal dimension of ShAfi'e's contribution has been placed in full view, thanks to Goldziher and, particularly, Schacht, the anti-Rationalist, Traditionalist theological dimension, unsuspected, has remained out of focus. This is, in part, due to the fact that ShAfici does not directly show his hostility to the Mu'tazila, or Ahl al-Kalam, in his Risdla. But he does make two significant statements which characterize his work as (1) Origins, p. 137.</page><page sequence="37">THE JURIDICAL THEOLOGY OF SHAFII1 41 fundamentally traditionalist. It is such statements as these, drawn together with various historical facts, which point directly to the theological dimension of Shifi'I's contribution. Both significant statements appear in the khufba, introduction, to ShWfi''s Risdla. The first statement, at the beginning of his introduction reads as follows: "Praise be to God... Who is as He has described Himself, and who is exalted above all the attributes given to Him by those among His creatures who have described Him" (al-hamdu li'lldhi ... 'l-ladhi huwa kamd wasafa nafsah, wa-fauqa md yasifuhd bihi khalquh). (1) The allusion is unmistakable. The traditionalists accept God's own description of Himself, His own attributes as He Himself has revealed them in His book and through His Messenger. The rationalists, especially the Mu'tazilis, whom Shifi'I called Ahl al-Kalam, attribute to God additional attributes resulting from their own speculations, held by the traditionalists as abominable, heretical innovations. The second statement, coming at the end of this introduction, reads as follows: "no event shall befall an adherent of God's religion but that there is a guide in the Book of God showing the right way to be followed" (fa-laisat tanzilu bi-ahadin min ahli dini 'lldhi ndzilatun illd wa-ft kitdbi 'lldhi 'd-dalilu 'ald sabili 'l-hudd fi-hd). (2) There is therefore no need to look beyond the Sacred Scriptures. The implication is clear: primacy goes to faith; reason takes second place. The Hanbali Ibn Qaiyim al-Jauzlya, in one of his works in which he treats of usdl al-fiqh, cites these two statements of Shafi'l, as well as other statements attributed to Shafi' , as evidence of the latter's hostility towards the Mutakallimun. (3) When the above statements of Shafi' are considered with the following facts already discussed in these pages, the tradi- tionalist, anti-rationalist, theological dimension of Shafi'I's Risdla comes into focus: (1) Shafi'1's attitude of hostility against the partisans of kalam; (2) the total lack of philosophical theology (1) Risdla, p. 8 (1. 3-4).

That the theological dimension of ShfiW'Ts contribution has remained out of focus may be seen in the erroneous classification of works on ugsl al-fiqh by some modern writers. One error consists in characterizing such works as belonging to one of two categories: (1) the "us.l" of the Shfift's or the mutakal- limun", and (2) "the utsdl of the Hanafis". (1) Another error consists in listing Shffi' and his Risdla at the head of a category entitled "the method of the mutakallimun", which is then contrasted with another category entitled "the method of the jurisconsults". (2) Shfi l, the first champion of traditionalist Islam, and Ahmad b. Ianbal, the second, were both imbued with a deep sense of submission to the Koran, the word of God, and the hadith, (1) See, for example, Muhammad Abc Zahra, U?sil al-flqh (Cairo: DAr ath- ThaqAfa al-'Arabtya, 1377/1957), p. 18 ("usil ash-ShAfil'ya au al-mulakallimtn"), and p. 20 ("usil al-hanaflya").

For Shifi'1, as for Ibn Hanbal, Mu'tazilism was the great enemy of true Islam; true Islam being unconditional submission to the message of God, and emulation of His Messenger, the first muslim. Upsll al-fiqh, before it came to be known by this term, was the weapon Shifi'c put in the service of Traditionalism against the rationalist movement. But two centuries later we find advocates of Rationalism authoring works on updl al-fiqh. As all rationalist sciences were excluded from the curriculum of the colleges, Rationalism, defeated politically, sought ways of infiltrating the curriculum. It therefore infiltrated, not only the schools of law (madhhab), but also the traditionalist sciences themselves, foremost among these being utsdl al-fiqh. For this subject is eminently receptive to two rationalist instruments of methodology: logic and, more particularly, dialectic. Such receptivity is illustrated by the work on logic in Ghazzalt's al-Mustasfd min 'ilm al-usl, and the work on dialectic in Ibn 'Aqll's al-Wddih. ft us.l al-fiqh. In his Risdla, Shdfi'i had asked no philosophical questions regarding legal obligation (laklif). The sources of obligation for him were the Koran and the Sunna, the word of God and the exemplary life of His Messenger. Man owes submission, isldm, to God. The legal system of Islam is one of divine voluntarism. Law is command and prohibition, God's com- mands and prohibitions (al-awdmir wa'n-nawdht). In such a system there is no room for the concept of natural law. In Islamic law, obligation does not inhere in the nature of things, (1) and ultimately in God who determines that nature. (2) Obliga- tion is based directly on His revealed law. The job of juris- prudence consists in supplying the methodology to bring out clearly all that man needs to know of his obligation toward God ('ibdddt) and those toward his fellow man (mu'dmaldt). Us.l al-fiqh, as originally conceived by ShMfi'I, is a juridical theology, a study of God's law, as distinguished from kalam, the study of God Himself; it is a study of God's commands and (1) Cf. St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, Q. 95, A.2, (2) Cf. ibid., Q. 93, A.4.</page><page sequence="40">44 GEORGE MAKDISI prohibitions, not of whether God is, or what He is. And as far as theology is concerned, the Traditionalist prefers "usll ad-din", the fundamentals of obedience to God, of religion, the study of what one should believe,-over kalam, "words" speculating about God Himself. The Rationalists found their way into the science of us.il al-fiqh through the problem of legal obligation. It was here that they came closest to the concept of natural law, but did not go all the distance to reach it. At any rate, this is how, in substance, they raised the problem of obligation: if the source of obligation is to be found in divine revelation, what about human acts before God gave us His revealed Law? What qualifications should be given to these acts and on what basis? Such were the questions raised; they could not be easily set aside. The dialogue was started between the opposing camps, giving us.l al-flqh one of its most important problems of legal philosophy. But it was clear where the Mu'tazilis meant to find the source of obligation before the revelation. God, before making us a gift of His revelation, had already made us a gift of reason; both gifts came from God. There could therefore be nothing in right reason that would contradict revelation, since they both came from the same divine source. The discussion did not get as far as a reconciliation of reason and revelation. The Traditionalists held on to their reasons for the primacy of faith; and the Rationalists clung to their faith in the primacy of reason. The rationalist element in upsl al-fiqh was there to stay. And because this science was essentailly a theology, albeit juridical, it cut across the lines of the schools of law. Writers, regarded as perfectly traditionalist, could now fathom all sorts of problems of legal philosophy without being condemned outright for their "rationalism". For while the writing of works on kalam was always either condemned out-of-hand, or at the least, regarded with suspicion, writing on usdll al-fiqh was held in high regard, for it was never considered as tainted with the sciences of the Ancients. Thus it is in works on u1sl al-flqh that one can judge the extent of Rationalism in the doctrine of a doctor of law through his elaboration of questions</page><page sequence="41">THE JURIDICAL THEOLOGY OF SHAFIi 45 of legal philosophy beyond those of juridical methodology. The schools of thought in Islamic jurisprudence (usal al-fiqh) cut across the schools of positive law (fiqh), and may be found in certain cases to align themselves with schools of thought in theology (ugsfl ad-din, kalam). The two works on usl l al-fiqh entitled Tanqihh, and Talwtih, chosen at random, are good illustrations of this point. Mahbfibt (d. 747/1346), who belon- ged to the Hanafi school of positive law, wrote the Tanqifh on udVl al-fiqh which is a reworking of the Upsl of Bazdawl, a Hanafi, of the Mahsdl of Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi, a Shifi'i, and the Mabdh.ith of Ibn al-.HIAjib, a Maliki. Later, Taftizan1 (d. 792/1390), a Shifi'i, wrote the TalwiFh as a commentary on the TanqiFh of Muhbfibi, the Hanafi. Another illustration is the Burhdn of al-Juwaini (d. 478/1085), a Shifi'I, on which two commentaries were written by al-MAzarI and al-Abharl, boths Malikis; who then censured Juwaini, an Ash'ari in theology, for criticizing Ash'ari, eponym of the Ash'ari theological move- ment, a movement whose members were, for the most part, Shifi'is in law. Zarkashi's interlocutor was, in effect, saying that there was no need to call this science by a new name, upsl al-fiqh being merely a motley conglomeration of curtailed sciences better treated each in its own place. The answer Zarkashl gave falls short of clearly designating the object of the new science, a designation which Fakhr ad-DIn ar-RAzi gives succinctly. Razl, as already mentioned, saw usdl al-fiqh as the science of ijtihdd, which, he declared, is neither the science of kalam, nor that of fiqh; kalam not being a component of ijtihdd, and fiqh being nothing but ijtihdd's resulting product. Shifi'i's Risdla is basically a work on methodology. In it Shifi'I is, in effect, saying: kalam is not the business of Islam; ijtihdd, based on the Sacred Scriptures, is the essence of Islamic religious science, and this Risdla gives you the method to follow, shows you how to go about it. If Sh&amp;fi'I had been asked to give a name to the subject of his book, he would perhaps have replied that it was nothing new, that it simply had to do with usdl ad-din, the roots of</page><page sequence="42">46 GEORGE MAKDISI religion; and if the term "ugsl al-fiqh" could have been suggested to him, he would perhaps have accepted it in the sense of "the roots of God's revealed law", which, after all, are the roots of the religion of Islam. Shifi'f's purpose in writing the Risdla was to counter any system of religious knowledge that pretends to go beyond the Koran and the Prophet's Sunna. In contrast to kalam, which went beyond the Scriptures to speculate about their author, God Himself, Shifi't's doctrine declared the Scriptures to be all that was needed for salvation. For Shifi'i believed that the divine revelation, as expressed in the Koran and the Prophet's Sunna, provides for every possible eventuality.(1) This is a traditionalist theme that runs through Islamic religious history. The Hanbali Ibn Taimlya (d. 728/1328), towards the end of his life, devoted one of his most significant treatises to it, entitled: Ma'drij al-waul ild ma'rifat anna ugsl ad-din wa-furi'aha qad bayyanahd 'r-rasal (The Steps leading to the Knowledge that the Messenger of God has already made a Clear Exposition of the Roots and Branches of Religion), a work the significance of which was justly appreciated well-nigh half a century ago by the eminent Islamist Henri Laoust. (2) From the late tenth or the beginning of the eleventh century, the works that have come down to us on usul al-fiqh, with questions properly belonging to kalam and legal philosophy, were authored not only by those who would be expected to include such questions in their works, namely members of the rationalist theological movements of Mu'tazilism and Ash'arism, but also by authors otherwise of strictly traditionalist affiliation. In illustration of this fact, the Musauwada of the Traditionalist Taimiya family may be given as an illustration, one among many others. This phenomenon strongly suggests that the future of Islamic theology may well be in the hands of the Usulis, rather than in those of the Mutakallimun. (1) See n. 2, p. 41.

We had both contributed articles to the publication in which Professor Laoust's article appeared; namely, Recherche d'Islamologie- Recueil d'articles offert a Georges C. Anawati el Louis Gardet par leurs colligues el amis (Louvain et Louvain-La-Neuve, 1978). But since contributors to the Festschrift had received only reprints of their articles and not the entire work, it was not until much later that I came upon the article in question, while paying a visit to our friend and colleague, M. Louis Gardet, in Toulouse. At first blush the article of M. Laoust would seem to be at variance with what has been said in the present study; but this first impression is quickly dissipated when the reader realizes that the apparent difference of opinion hinges on the terms used for theology: kalam and us'l ad-din. There is a distinction to be made, as the reader may gather from what has been said in the foregoing study. The reader is further referred to a previous study, "Ash'arl and the Ash'arites in Islamic Religious History", in Studia Islamica, XVII (1962), pp. 37-80, and XVIII (1963), pp. 19-39, where the two terms are studied historically. On page 399 of his article, Professor Laoust distinguishes between "two great forms of kalam": (1) a theology essentially speculative in nature, treating of the great problems of (philo- sophical) theology; and (2) a juridico-moral theology treating of man's obligations toward God and His creatures. Then he says: "it is this last form of kalam that interested Shafi'l above all in the Risdla, the Kildb al-Umm and the Kildb Ikhtildf al-hadith". With this statement, the foregoing study is in complete agreement. In keeping with the historical attitude of the Traditionalists, I prefer to reserve for this type of theology the term usdl ad-din, "the fundamentals of faith", in contradis- tinction to kalam, which would be reserved for philosophical theology, that theology developed by the Mu'tazilis and the Ash'aris.
