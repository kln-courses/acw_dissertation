<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS AT CAN HASAN, 1966 SIXTH PRELIMINARY REPORT By D. H. FRENCH THE SIXTH SEASON of excavations at Can Hasan took place between 28th August and 3oth September. Additional work on storing and arranging the non-registered materials from the excavations continued until 12th October. All materials other than the registered objects from the 1961 to the 1966 seasons are now stored in the depot at Can Hasan. These are the sherds, animal bones, heavy stone objects, the samples of stone, clay and other materials. They are stored by year and by category in locked storerooms in the dig house. In addition to the house bekfi there is now a full-time official bekfi for the Hiyiik and for other hiiyiiks in the neighbourhood. In the I966 excavations Messrs. D. C. Biernoff, S. Payne and J. N. Postgate were field assistants ; Mrs. Payne took charge of the work in the house, assisted by Mr. C. Slack and the Misses M. Bell, C. Prater, and T. Harrington-Smith. In addition Mrs. Payne had charge of the pottery ; Mr. Payne of the obsidian, Miss Harrington-Smith of registration and Mr. Slack and Miss Bell of conservation and pottery mending. Bay Bedri Yalman from the Konya Museum represented the Turkish Government. All registered objects were taken to the Ankara Museum. All other objects and materials are stored at Can Hasan. THE 1966 SEASON The objectives of the 1966 season were similar to those of the previous year: (I) to continue the excavation of House 7 (Layer 2 B, Early Chalcolithic) started in 1962 and continued in 1964 and 1965; (2) to excavate more of Layer 3; (3) to excavate below Layer 3 ; (4) to continue the excavation of Layer 2 A in and around square S 25 c. In addition, the search for a deposit containing sherds of Mersin XVI type (which still elude discovery) continues.' LAYER I LA TE CHALCOLITHIC The only Late Chalcolithic deposit to be excavated this year was the earliest phase (phase f) of Layer I. A surface of white clay, known from the previous season in square S 25 c, was cleaned and explored in square S 25 a. Nothing was found on this surface and very little pottery came from the fill above it. There were a few, tiny scraps of animal bone. LAYER 2 A In I966 excavation took place in two areas : (i) Work continued in square S 25 c on the south side of the excavation area. In the 1965 season this square produced a large quantity of pottery (and animal bones) from a deposit immediately below the earliest phase (phase f) of Layer i. This deposit was taken to represent the latest of several which, grouped together, make up Layer 2 A.2 The layers of the 2 A period, known from S 25 c, were traced in S 25 a. This square, immediately to the north of S 25 c, had been excavated in 1963 to a floor of phase d of Layer I. 1 AS XIII (1963) 36 and Fig. 5 : 15, i6. 2 AS XVI (1966) 116.</page><page sequence="2">OH S 25 a S 25 c i* ..0'-0.- 0,- 9? ?

ARCHITECTURE (Plan: Fig. 2 ; Sections: Figs. I and 3) In square S 25 c no architecture was found. A series of surfaces and burnt hearth-areas began below the 2 A deposit found in 1965. These surfaces continued downwards to a depth of 5.50 m. at which point excavation stopped. They may O R 21 -21  22 0 FIG. 2.

The surfaces and hearths were seen in section (Fig. i) to be in clear association with the structures in S 25 a. These mud-brick walls, four in number 3 and built more or less one above the other, are not well preserved and survive only for a few courses. There are no apparent " living-surfaces " on the north side of these walls but only an accumulation of rubbish and soil, featureless except for wash-lines (i.e. water-laid bands of fine-textured clay). This phenomenon may be explained by the discovery 3 This is, in fact, best shown in the west section.</page><page sequence="4">oo) 00 0 t&gt;. z C2: H.

This slope may represent the line of a terrace cut out of the older (Layer 2 B) mound by the later inhabitants (of Layer 2 A). The north wall of the mud-brick structure may therefore have served as a retaining wall. Behind (i.e. to the north of) one of these walls was found a large deposit of pottery and further north up the slope two infant skeletons. Work was continued in square Q 2 id (Plan : Fig. 2 ; Section : Fig. 3). This area had been excavated to (or nearly to) what was thought to be a floor level of a Layer 2 B house, no. 8. Although the pottery from this house had been entirely of Layer 2 A types, this was not (in 1962) thought to be strange since re-occupation of Layer 2 B houses in the 2 A period was known from other trenches. Both alignment and construction exactly followed that of the 2 B settlement. In 1966, however, it soon became clear that House 8 was a structure which belonged entirely to Layer 2 A and was only one of a series of structures and superimposed walls, all belonging to Layer 2 A. Square Q 2 I1 c, the excavation of which was begun but not completed in 1964, was re-opened in 1966. From this square also, architecture of Layer 2 A came to light. The combination of the results from these two squares Q 21 c and d provides much-needed evidence on Middle Chalcolithic architecture. The structures in these two squares are not as well preserved as the buildings of Layer 2 B and the line of some walls can now be reconstructed only on paper. Nevertheless there is good evidence of frequent rebuilding and remodelling and there is plentiful material in association with these walls. The samples of pottery and animal bone in particular are good. On present evidence the only major difference in building method between Layer 2 B and 2 A is a greater use of stone foundations in 2 A. The brick size seems to be the same or only slightly smaller in the later period. Evidence for the lay-out of the settlement is meagre but it should be noted that these groups of structures both in Q 21I c/d and S 25 a/c lie along the probable edge of the 2 B settlement. POTTERY There is nothing new to add to previous accounts of the pottery of Layer 2 A.4 Squares S 25 a and c produced very little pottery, except for a group of broken pots found north of one of the retaining walls, but in squares Q 21 c and d several good samples were found in well defined contexts. Phases 2 and 3 were well represented.5 SMALL OBJECTS Stone.-More fine objects were found this year. As well as beads, pendants and fragments of several bracelets there were two small studs or nails. Heavy objects of the common types were also found. Obsidian.-More material was recovered similar in quantity and type to that from previous years. Clay.-One figurine of unbaked clay is of considerable interest. It shows an animal with horns sloping forward. On the back there is preserved at one side a rough " saddle " and a thick coil over it. The whole figurine stands about o .o75 m. high. Metal.-No evidence of metal was found. 4 AS XII (1962) 32 ; AS XIII (1963) 34 ; AS XV (1965) 90 ; AS XVI (1966) 1I6. 5 AS XVI (1966) i16.</page><page sequence="6">170 ANATOLIAN STUDIES Bone, Shell and Ivory.-A good range of bone and horn implements was found. One bone needle was over o- i6 m. long. Pendants of both bone and shell were recovered. The most interesting find is what we presume to be a bracelet (half is preserved) made from ivory, though the identification of the material has not yet been confirmed. Grain and seed.-Small samples were recovered from the sieving. Bones.-Good samples were recovered though from preliminary examination nothing can be added to the species already identified.6 R / t 't //  / FIG. 4.

LAYER 2 B Work continued throughout the 1966 season on the clearing of House 7 and the main evidence of Layer 2 B came from square R 21 b. However in square Q 2 I d, under the lowest (and earliest) of the building phases of Layer 2 A, a building belong- ing to Layer 2 B came to light. Further work will be done on this structure in future seasons. ARCHITECTURE (Plans : Figs. 2 and 4 ; Sections : Figs. 3 and 5) As a result of the excavations in 1966, the plan of House 7 (published in AS XVI 8 AS XIII (1963) 35 ; AS XV (1965) 90.</page><page sequence="7">C) C2 (0 cO) R21 b R 21 a 1 0 -T7ITTTI7TITTTJ 13e ... . ..9 +_, _ ... . +-9 C7 - .. . . .1Wit4 - Wt4tit/ ? fill , . . . . _ ? .

A wall which is probably the north wall of this building was found this year in square R 21 b (Plan : Fig. 4). The line of this wall is not straight ; instead of joining the west wall, it turns at right-angles, north- eastwards, at a distance of ca. 2 m. from the west wall. Between the corner of this (north) wall and the west wall, a cross-wall was inserted on a foundation of small stones. In the northeast corner of square R 21 b and north of House 7, there was, at a lower (absolute) level than the earliest floor of House 7, an occupied area or space of which only the southern part lay within the limits of the square. The purpose of this area or space is not clear. Why this " north wall " of House 7 should have been constructed in this way is not yet known. The north face of the wall and the floor of the space beyond it were frequently renovated by the addition of thick layers of mud-plaster faced with thin coats of red (clay ?). This space had been constructed by terracing into the core of the mound. The stratification of the earlier layers was to be seen quite clearly when we removed the north wall of House 7 and thereby revealed the scarp of the terrace. In square Q 21 d, beneath the structures now associated with Layer 2 A, a house built of large yellow mud-bricks (similar to those used for House 7) was exposed (Plan : Fig. 2 ; Section : Fig. 3). Only a few courses of brick survive from this building but it is clear that it repeats the type of Layer 2 B house-plan familiar from earlier seasons. The fill against the west wall contained pottery of characteristic Layer 2 B types. The surface-lines associated with the base of this wall slope away downwards towards the west and there is no evidence that the settlement continued further westwards. Since there is no evidence for courtyards in the area of the 2 B settlement, we may, therefore, suggest that square Q 21 d marks the edge of the Layer 2 B settlement at the west. It may also be supposed that the slope in S 25 a and c marks an approximate edge of the 2 B settlement on the south side. If these suppositions prove correct, we shall have answered one of the major problems concerning the 2 B settlement : that of its overall size. POTTERY There is nothing to add to last year's summary (AS XVI (1966) i18). This season produced good, corroboratory evidence for the three phases of Layer 2 B.7 This sequence is based mainly on the stratigraphy of House 7. A most important problem at both ?atal Hiyutk and Can Hasan is the introduction or development of painted pottery. At Can Hasan the first occurrence of brown or red patterned pottery falls, on present evidence, a short time before the building of House 7. There is only a slight amount of painted pottery in Layer 3. At Can Hasan it is now seen that thefloruit of the Qatal West Style 8 extends over no more than one stratigraphic phase within a major building period. SMALL OBJECTS Stone.-As well as the typical range of heavy objects, there was this year a selection of small beads of azurite. Obsidian.-The sample recovered was similar to last year's but less in quantity. Clay.-A potstand of the anthropomorphic type found previously in Layer 2 A came from square R 21 b and from the Layer 2 B material within House 7 a miniature female figurine of the squatting type was recovered. The head is missing and the existing height is o -02 m. 7AS XVI (1966) I18. 8 AS XV (1965) 136.</page><page sequence="9">EXCAVATIONS AT CAN HASAN, 1966 173 Metal.-From within House 7 from lines which represent the second phase of Layer 2 B came a fragment of copper. The copper objects found in 1961 and 1962 came from the third phase. Bone.-The range of bone and horn implements continues to increase. This year as well as small beads we found a needle, points, a horn sleeve and a well-made spatula of horn. Grain and Seed.-Small samples were recovered from the sieving. Carbon.-A good sample was recovered from one of a series of hearths in R 21 b, from House 7. Bones.-No new species were identified 9 but good samples were recovered particularly from the northeast corner of square R 21 b. LAYER 3 The layer was investigated in 1965 only in square R 21 a. In 1966 further remains of the building found in square R 21 a were excavated in square R 21 b. ARCHITECTURE (Plan: Fig. 4; Section: Fig. 5) Almost the full extent of the north and west walls has now been excavated. The east and south walls probably lie under the walls of House 7. It is clear that the builders of House 7 were aware of the existence of the earlier walls and made use of parts of these walls as a solid foundation for their own building. The structure in squares R 21 a and b is as big and substantial as its successor, House 7. The house walls are ca o -80 m. thick with strong internal buttresses. POTTERY The sample of pottery from this layer is still not adequate. No whole pots were found on the floor ; the fill of the building is a yellow clay, which appears to be dis- integrated mud-brick, and is noticeably poor in sherd material. The shapes of the pottery appear to be the predecessors of Layer 2 B shapes ; the surface treatment is mostly red or brown slipped. SMALL OBJECTS As for the pottery there was very little to be found on the floors and in the fill of the Layer 3 structure. The total range of objects found was four fragmentary querns, eight pieces of obsidian, and small samples of animal bone. One of the obsidian pieces is retouched and might have been an awl. LAYERS 4-7 A small test trench was dug in the southwest corner of square R 21 b down to a depth of 4 mn.10 This trench revealed a sequence of at least four superimposed mud- brick buildings. There may be i m., perhaps more, of deposit still to be excavated before reaching the original surface. ARCHITECTURE (Section : Fig. 5) Nothing is known yet of the plan of any of these houses. Some of the mud-bricks seem to be smaller than those used in Layers 3 and 2 B. There is some evidence that " AS XIII (1963) 36 ; AS XV (1965) 90. 10 This represents an absolute level and is approximately 0.50 m. above the present level of the plain on the east, and 0.50 m. below it on the west side of the mound.</page><page sequence="10">174 ANATOLIAN STUDIES CHART I: CHART OF C-i14 DATES HACILAR QATAL CAN HASAN MERSIN S,.,-- &gt; &gt; ;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ;&gt; &gt; x -- -- 1-4 P c~-4 tC - - - - o - C ) C ) I--.r- 1--o Cr C )e C ) 0 ~C) )C)c S I 00 5000 4500 4000 -</page><page sequence="11">EXCAVATIONS AT CAN HASAN, 1966 175 CHART 2: CHART ILLUSTRATING THE COMPARATIVE STRATIGRAPHY OF WESTERN ANATOLIA AND CILICIA MERSIN CAN HASAN QATAL HACILAR 6- ooo " Basal" VIII 5500 0 IX?* 7 1 VI* II II 5000 (?

There was a burnt surface (? hearth) associated with the wall of Layer 6. POTTERY The amount of pottery found in these layers was not large. It is, however, clear that the general character of the pottery is close to that of the Upper Neolithic levels at Mersin (e.g. XXVI and XXVII) and the upper levels of gatal East (unstratified surface material). There is not total resemblance and it may be concluded that these layers at Can Hasan help to complete the sequence between gatal East level o and gatal West Early Chalcolithic I. The main shape appears to be a hole mouth jar (Fig. 6 :2) ; there are also small bowls with out-turned rims (Fig. 6: i). Surface colours are dark brown or dark red ; the surface was finely burnished. SMALL OBJECTS Stone.-Several fragments of querns were recovered from these building levels. We also found part of a shallow limestone dish. Obsidian.-The sample is as yet very small and no individual pieces were distinctive. Bone.-Three well-made bone points were found. Carbon.-A good sample was recovered from the hearth in Layer 6. Bones.-Only a small sample has yet been recovered and no preliminary study has been undertaken. SUMMARY The basic aim of the excavation at Can Hasan has been to recover a strati- graphic sequence of pottery for the so-called Early Chalcolithic, Middle Chalcolithic and Late Chalcolithic periods, a sequence which would run from (atal Neolithic through to the Bronze Age of Kara Hitytik, Konya and which could be linked by pottery occurrences to the sequence of Mersin and the Cilician plain. Particular importance may now be given to the discovery at Can Hasan itself of building levels, apparently consecutive, assignable to the Neolithic period. The progress made in establishing the stratigraphic sequence in the Konya Plain and the comparative sequence of the Konya Plain, Mersin and Hacilar is shown in the charts, pp. 174- 175.11 From the second chart it can be seen immediately that the introduction of painted12 pottery within Western Anatolia is chronologically somewhat uneven. Remaining work at Can Hasan will concentrate on expanding the pottery groups within the sequence which has now been established. As much information as possible will be recovered concerning the architecture and artifacts of each phase represented in the sequence. At the same time the obligation and need to recover materials, probably not spectacular, but certainly rewarding, underlies all the work " The absolute dates are based on the following C-14 determinations which are calculated on the half-life of 5568 years. They are shown diagrammatically in the chart, p. 174.

Because of the range of the Can Hasan sequence it should now be possible to trace the developments and perhaps the origins, within the Konya Plain, of agriculture and animal husbandry. By establishing a sequence on the basis of pottery which may be related to Hacilar and to Mersin (and perhaps further East) it may be possible to clarify and to emphasize the chronological unevenness and the overall complexity of material development within Anatolia itself as well as the Near East as a whole and thus to put into perspective the artistic products and archaeological remains of the Konya Plain.
