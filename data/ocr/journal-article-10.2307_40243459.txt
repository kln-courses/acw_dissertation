<plain_text><page sequence="1">Albert Goldbarth Worlds In 1907 my grandfather landed on Mars, he'd come so far from his village in Poland. The water lapping the pilings: that was Mars, the wharf itself was Mars, the mongol rampage of rats was Martian rats that led, by alley shadows and vats of impossible stinks, to the jammed, flat-broke and flash-o'-diamonds flush, fat, flammable, wholly contradictory and madcap heart of New York: the capital city of Mars. A dockside conniver had offered to turn his meager crumple of Polish paper money into "'Merica gelt" - a chiseler bogused-up in a black silk skullcap. Here my grandfather stands, some zomboid creature lolling on the trolley tracks, immobilized by too much Mars too fast. The trolley's stalled, of course, and clanging at him as if he were a cow. He's less than a cow. He's a dumbshit Yid, with Hope and Terror frozen in a polka-step in his breast, and half-a-handful of chump-change tric- kling out of his fingers. * That night he slept beneath an overturned clawfoot bathtub, in a dump behind the warehouse district. At daybreak, when even the garbage shone majestically for a mo- ment, he clambered out, as warily as a hermit crab. "So. You're Jewish?" A man was standing right there, he spoke in Yiddish. "I come here every morning." He gave the tub a dull kick. 'Three days out of four, some greenhorn's spent the night here. Come, you need help?" He was wearing a black silk skullcap. Once, all right - but not twice: my grand- father threw a loopy punch at his jaw, that he barely sidestepped. Then, as if he'd practiced this for hours already, the man hunched, swiveled, and neatly tripped my grandfather into a mushy pile of restaurant trash. He held out his hand. "I tell you: come. You need help." It turned out he was legitimate - the Hebrew Immigration Aid Society. They walked away, like a father leading his mesmerized son. And that night my grandfather slept in a bed. 6 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">Reprinted from George Herriman's Krazy Ignatz: A Katnip Kantata in the Key ofK (vol. 7 of The Komplete Kat Komics), Eclipse Books/Turtle Island Foundation, 1991. Albert Goldbarth 7</page><page sequence="3">It was one often beds in the room, in an HIAS hospice that looked like a caved- in orange crate done up to the size of a boardinghouse. A week, they said he could stay here; not that he even knew which day it was. His nine bed-brethren were already sleeping, filling the dark with their heavy-as-sandbags breaths. An elderly woman had led him here by the skimpiest pinch of candle - now by touch alone he opened his oilcloth sack, removed his pamphlet with the text of the shacbris^ minchah and mahriv prayers, and placed it delicately beneath the slab of newspaper meant for a pillow. At 5 am he leaped up screaming, and ran for a broom in the corner. "GVald! G'vald!" his roommates heard him shouting, "Geshtroft! Tshepeh zich op fun mir!" (Help! Accursed thing, get away from me!) Watching him, their protector, beat the alarm clock into a pile of springs and glassy powder, until it was stilled. He had a lot to learn here. * And he'd prepared, in his nowhere sticks-and-baling-wire village: had perfected his Polish-inflected Yiddish once a week in "immigration class," in the shack out back of Oyzer the cheesemaker's; and had learned "yes," "no," "hey buddy" and the names of seven Presidents starting with Vahsheenktun. But nothing could prepare him for the series of spirit-deadening jobs. He learned why everyone woke at 5 am He learned what they suffered before returning fourteen hours later. First he became a roller - this meant standing for the whole shift, in a windowless, unventilated room. One day, the draggled end of a day, he did his last cigar and couldn't uncrimp his fingers. After that, he scavenged rags; there was a company that cleaned them in benzene, then trimmed and pressed them. When he worked up to being a trimmer, he was given a space on the fire escape; it was early December, thin snow started falling, and the shop boss wouldn't let him back inside until he'd filled his daily quota. After that, he shoveled horses' shit. The company even brought him out to the race track, it was like getting a promotion: shoveling better horses' shit. "Hey buddy - c'mere." He delivered back-and-forth the envelopes by which races were fixed. He wasn't proud of this; but he wasn't starving. * By now it's 1911. "Hey Louie - dipping your dingus lately?" My grandfather startled up from reading his pulp adventure magazine. He could read - a little. He could shoot the shit with the knock-about guys - a little. Even so, a kind of shameful concern was written over his knobby features. Here they caught him galloping over the novelette-length Wild West, but once again he didn't even know the local argot, from the corner of Forman and Hester. 8 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="4">"Louie, Louie, Louie," with a pitying nod of his richly-pomaded temples. Then he made the little universal sexual mortar-and-pestle sign with his fingers. "Louie: get- ting any?" A wink, a manly clap on the back. They were at Jake's, the candy store - the traditional roughneck hangout. In a neighborhood of rougher necks than Jews', it would have been the pool hall. Here you wouldn't go to find the rabbi, or the penny-a-page bar mitzvab tutor: no. The shoeshined streetwise congregated here, the wisenheimers and two-bit racketeers, the Jewish cabbies and tough-stuff welterweight prizefighters, even a big ward boss's sharp-creased, pinky-ringed vizier. Hello Mister I-Own-All-Of-Forman-Street, thought my grandfather. What he said, though, was "Oh- yah, yah, the sex," and grinned sheepishly, and loathed himself for it. But, hey: these were the boys with the easy mezuma folded in rhinestone clips, and they were walking their slice-of-cheesecake smiles straight out of these broken streets, on a beam of American moonlight. And the pamphlet of prayers, of shachris, minchah^ mabriv&gt; Did its ghost form ever flutter, a transparent moth, among the racks of racing gazettes and copies of Amazing Adventure* * "Louie," he said, "don't kid me. I bet you got the hot pants for some little tsatch- keleh, right?" He didn't wait for an answer. He poked his finger at the cover of the magazine- a rugged buckaroo and a supple Indian princess sped their horses over the plains. "You can shovel their shit your whole life, Louie, you listening? Or you can ride one." Louie wasn't sure what language this was, but he knew he'd better apply himself assiduously to a study of the licorice nibs and jawbreakers. "Louie, you listening? We got a little job." * And Louie did have the hot pants. He'd met Rosie at the Sewing Sisters Associa- tion balln (a ball, a dance). She had a solid peasant modesty, when posing at the punchbowl, with her friends; her hair was tied in a bun, as tight as a fist. But she could dip and slink a catty Coney Island dance-step that you'd swear would call down fire from the sky, and then she shook out a luscious tumble of frizzled hair. He wanted to swim in that hair, die in that hair, like a salmon. What she saw in him ... who knows? The world is full of smooth-move wooers. Did she understand that knobby face would give a woman something she could hold to? They were born not more than twenty miles apart. Yes, but they needed to come to America to meet! Can you imagine! Etc. The moon was out, as big up there as a catcher's mitt. He watched her ankles skitter about the shadows of her skirts. They Albert Goldbarth 9</page><page sequence="5">seemed to have minds of their own, like small white creatures in undergrowth. He touched her, and she stopped his hand, but she didn't walk away. "Is nice - yah?" She was looking up at the full, lush, scoop-of-butter-brickle moon. "In Poland, I see this moon. Now here, I see this moon. Not so much makes from the changes." "Some rings. In Poland, I don't know your This was a major romantic speech for him, and she recognized that. "Louie, promise me - nobody else, you'll vant?" "Rosie, Rosie." "Louie, a name is not a promise." "Rosie, yah, all right already, I promise." "A promise lasts, you know this. A promise . . ." searching for a definition ". . . is bigger than all of the miles." "Rosie, I know vhafs a promise, believe me." What was she reading? his heart? his dick? She took a quick breath and decided. "Come - my friend Rebecca, her zaydec raises chickens, they haff this little room for the chickens." She grabbed his hand. "You dun't mind chickens?" No, he didn't mind chickens. He wouldn't have minded a herd of mad elk. That night he didn't dip his dingus; she was carefuller than that. But it began, that night. The more they talked, the more they met to sweatily clench in chicken drek, of course the more they had in common. Eventually a look across a room was telegraph- ically charged. Yet there is no perfect congruity. There's a panel in one of George Herriman's exemplary Krazy Kat comic strips, where Officer Pupp is smitten under the lunar orb, and batting googoo eyes at the Kat. They say, in their Herrimanesque patois: "Ah-h, 'Krazy5 I wonder if yon 'moon' - yon 'June moon' - yon 'love moon' - does not suggest something to you?" "Sure it do 'Offissa Pupp' - chizz - swiss chizz." * Some nights, rolling away from him, she'd peek back at his snoozing gnomish features and be panicked by the alienness of somebody not herself, with his own con- taining skin and hungers. She had always believed you built a future stone by stone. She was practical, she kept a piled list of her grocery purchases and their prices going back to shack-life in Poland, every morning she scoured every fleck from the hall sink. Her three scarves, that were her treasures, she always hung away in what she perceived to be their proper chromatic order. And he - ! A blonjenkop, a "lost head," a dreamer. He was forever shlepping the sack in somebody else's tycoon scheme. She had a brother, Nate, he managed the shop where a silent row of hunched-over Jews ground lenses for glasses. "Shpeckatickles, Louie," Nate explained, and with his IO NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="6">thumb and forefinger made a circle of each hand, at his eyes. "Pree-siSH-un vork!" And they were booming, too, Louie could see that: orders slopping over the desk (it needed Rosie's touch) and the grinders bent to their wheels and fussy buffing-sticks from just past sunup to dusk. "But vhere to go from here? Vhat is our Foochur? Louie, ve need someone," and now his arm around Louie's shoulder, "to fink big new things, ve need somebody inDOOSstrious!" And Nate would splay the fingers of his free hand, slowly arcing it across the air as if, in its wake, the lineaments of a glittering and unstoppable To- morrow could be seen. But Louie didn't think he was indoostrious. He didn't really know what he was, most days when he woke he barely knew where. And Rosie kept mentioning Nate's place increasingly, bringing the topic to bed with them, confusing it with the sweet beast scent of their mutual explorations - a woman whose wants and visions and hil- locky, billowy body might have been, for him, the complete relief map of another planet. * I mention this now, in 1990, long after my grandfather's yielded bones are gelatin and a calcium cloud, because it explains the trip he took, vacationing away from the city, trying to clear his "lost head" of conundrums. Some of his friends pitched in: a train ticket, first class ("Got you kless number vun!" said Alfie Sprintzer). This is what did it, finally; this was the straw: 'We've got to start you out small, you understand that, Louie. But this could be a big-time operation." Jake had gone in back to count a new shipment of jellybeans. He understood when his ears would best be clean of certain talk. The man who owned Forman Street possessed, and knew he could rely on, a con- fiding, persuasive voice. That voice, those gesturing hands at the ends of their fancy uptown double-starched cuffs, had won over aldermen down at the Hall. Kid pick- pockets basked in that voice, no less than city development entrepreneurs. Now it was Louie's, all Louie's, lotiony and gold. The plan was simple: they were organizing, and none too soon, the sharpers down at the docks. Louie would be in charge, the captain. All of the fakes out there, the money-changers crying out their "'Merica geltV" and wearing their black silk skull- caps?- they would report to him, to Louie, the maker and shaker, the aha kocker, the Kingpin of the Wharves ! He looked down to his magazine cover: the uncomplicated air of the West, with a yee-ha! and a yippi-ai-yay! * In 1907 George Herriman arrived in New York, from L.A., with a five-cent shine on his shoes and a dollar's-worth of sketch pads. Yes and by 1912, he was being sent Albert Goldbarth 11</page><page sequence="7">by Hearst himself to do a series of comic slice-of-life reports from west of the Missis- sippl. Hearst had been impressed by Herriman's earlier coverage for the Los Angeles Times, especially UNIDENTIFIED AIRSHIP SIGHTINGS HAUNT IMPERIAL VALLEY Monster Soars Through Air Makes Clicking Noise and Carries A Light Should Salt Be Put On Tail Of This Fly By Night? with typically Herrimanesque illustrations. Hearst would see that doors were opened, and jaws of importance oiled for talk. All Herriman had to do was - well, react like Herriman, and mail it back for relishment by an eager New York readership. Hearst couldn't have been more emphatic, and Herriman couldn't in any case have been more eager to revisit the land of butte and Navajo hogan he'd come to love when bumming the rails twelve years earlier, a punk cartoonist wanna-be with inky stars in his eyes. (Well now it's a first-class ticket and six clicking bottles of Hearst's own private-brewed ale.) He'd written, "Those mesas and sunsets out in that oie pais pintado ... a taste of that stuff sinks you - deep." (Well now it was: next stop, Arizona!) And he'd have time, as over half the continent clacked on by, to scratch away at some ideas for this new strip he was going to juggle room for, some time next year. It's night. The side compartment lights are on, a light so yellow it turns his eggshell sketchbook page to saffron. He rolls a smoke, with one hand, from his shirt-pocket pouch of Bull Durham; with the other, he keeps on idly scribbling . . . what does the mouse say now? . . . then what does the bulldog say? . . . then Krazy Kat. * This isn't the place to insist on the screwball, skew-all genius of that 31-year run of hi-jinks, low-jinks, and oh-so-sly-winks vaudevillian philosophy: I've paid homage to it elsewhere, as have others more knowing and eloquent than I am, in the history of such stuffs. As Gilbert Seldes said in his banner-raising essay of 1924, "Krazy Kat is, to me, the most amusing and fantastic and satisfactory work of art produced in Amer- ica today. With those who hold that a comic strip cannot be a work of art I shall not traffic." With his lopsided (or, with Officer Pupp a participant, truly kop-sided) tri- angle (ever-ingenue Krazy; villainous Ignatz Mouse; and Pupp of the local kon- stabulary), Herriman created a krackpot kosmos that transcended the limitations of its form, and became, in all of its antic variety, a single sinuous rhapsody of comic meditation, mythopoetic and simply heels-clicking high-spirited at once. What I need to mention now, though, is "Herriman's language, Joycean before Finnegan's Wake - the words all working, bouncing, and playing off one another, veering from a bop rhythm to a dazzling poesy. As Ignatz Mouse said, 'Plain lan- guage, but in a higher plane.'" So says Krazy Kat: the Art of George Herriman, and points out that the "alphabet soup" involved here included "Victorian prose, the lowest street slang, onomatopoeia, 12 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="8">Spanish, French, the alliteration of Navajo names, and" - mais oui ("Of cawss you may," the Kat might say, "be my guess") - "the Yiddishized diction of New York's Lower East Side." When Krazy arcs her flapjacks backwards, then presto catches them standing on her head, her self-approving comment on her adroitness is "Oy, a trix - fency." I belabor this because, as the miles rattlingly pass, George Herriman sits there, doodling, with his lumped-up swayback Stetson hat pushed so far back on his head it's nearly a memory . . . sits there fascinatedly eyeing this fellow across the aisle, who's reading a richly garish-covered issue of All-Story, moving his lips along the English as if grazing it, stopping every now and then to argue vehemently with the open text, with frequent punctuations as the hero faces imminent demise (or love-hugs): "Oy!" "G'vald!" * But when Herriman tapped him lightly on the shoulder and wordlessly offered him a room-temperature beer, my grandfather rose to the lingual occasion. "Hey buddy, man, hokay by me, Mac!" He'd had nothing to eat since Ohio, when the last of Rosie's sandwiches ran out; and there's a Yiddish saying, Beser toyt shiker eyder toyt hungerik-Rctter dead drunk than dead hungry. Louie raised the sweating bottle to his benefactor: "L'chayim." It was gone in four pulls. So they talked. They shmoozed, they chewed the phoneme fat together long past the world-revivifying rise of the next day's sun. Life. Women. Betting the ponies. Legendary New York dandies. Those airships (after Herriman explained them). Dreams. Death. Dipping the dingus. What's suffering for. The grand themes, newly girded and gilded to match these farflung temperaments. Herriman opened his sketchbook gingerly, and my grandfather studied the whole incipient anthropomorphic cast, including Joe Stork and Gooseberry Sprig the Duck Duke. "Dun't vorry," he said encouragingly, with all of the friendly largesse he could fit in a smile, "you vork hard, you gonna gets better." Herriman found this a real hoot. "Lou-boy, you tickle my buzzum," he told him. And later, passing pastureland in the slumbrous touch of the noontime sun- "mooy!" my grandfather shouted, and in explanation pointed at a cow. And you can see her, lowing out that bovine Yiddishism, in panel 6 of the April 12, 1922 Krazy Kat. * But this is 1912. Night's circled back again, George Herriman is snoring, and Louie studies the huge, close dockface of a full moon, and the innumerable stars, as many, as painfully lovely, as when he'd look up at the sky from the rural darkness of Poland. Where was he running to now, and why? He'd told Rosie he'd write. How complicated does any one life become in always refolding itselft Albert Goldbarth 13</page><page sequence="9">The Kat will also wander her gaze "among the unlimitless etha." The Kat will also sing a runaway's tune: "Press my pents / An' shine my shoes / Gimme twenny cents / To pay my dews - / For Fm goin5 far a-waay - / Tidday." But that's still in the future. For now, it's my grandfather, watching the night-black sand, and the nearly touchable desert sky, go streaking through his head he sees reflected in the window he looks out from. It's almost as if he's watching his own brain first inventing these things: the desert, the wheel of zodiac, such admirable creations. . . . And his constellation, The- Stars-Like-Stones-In-A-Chicken's Gizzard, grinding another night away. . . . He sleeps. . . . Next stop, Arizona. 2. "Is The Master Unit ready?" "No sir. Not yet sir. But. . . ." "2?#t?" Lowell is indignant. Or can a person be indignant with a machine? He shrugs, he loses the prickly edge of his exasperation. A night is only so long. He has work. * He was named after Percival Lowle - and his pedigree is traceable back unshakeably to this nominative worthy who, in 1639, age 68, in the considerable company of his wife Rebecca and fourteen others related by blood or business, boarded the Jonathan in London, and nine weeks later arrived at Newbury, forty miles northwest of Boston. In general, the Puritan settlers of Massachusetts Bay "were more affluent, better educated and of a higher social class than any other large group of colonists who came to America." Their intention was to establish a society of saints, as an exemplum for the future, and so their settlement "in the eyes of Puritan leaders . . . appeared to be the most significant act of human history since Christ bade farewell to His disciples." Categorizing the simultaneous settlers of Virginia, Massachusetts Bay Governor Win- throp dusted off his saintly thesaurus and referred to "unfitt instruments - a multitude of rude and misgoverned persons, the very scumm of the people." The Lowles were a specialdom even amidst the Massachusetts elect: "Percival Lowle, Gent." bore the heraldic ensign of knighthood (it was the family's since the fifteenth century); educated richly, he could speak Italian Mantuan, and read Ovid in the original. At twenty-six, he had been Assessor of Lands - an inherited office - and, later, a prosperous import/export merchant prince. Not surprisingly, Lowle, with this advantageous background and his own ambi- tious savvy, throve in America. He lived to write a 100-line elegy for Governor Win- throp. He died in 1664, age ninety-three; from then, unbroken, the family stock con- tinues, privileged, meritorious, nearly sacrosanct: "the Lowells speak only to God" becomes a common comic trope, and for three generations about the textile town of Lowell, Massachusetts, "Lowell" and "millionaire" are properly synonymous. 14 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="10">In 1854, Augustus Lowell married into another Boston Brahmin dynasty, and his wife, the former Katharine Lawrence, bore three children: Amy, the youngest, the Imagist poet; Abbott, the middle, the President of Harvard; and the eldest, Percival, born in 1855. "I came into this world with a comet, Donati's Comet of 1858 being my earliest recollection - and I can see yet a small boy halfway up a turning staircase gazing with all his soul into the evening sky where the stranger stood." * And all of this brings us down to autumn, mid-autumn, of 1912. He's at the 24-inch telescope, a man of fifty-seven as straight and staunch all night as a styptic pencil. He's looking. He's in his eighteenth year of looking, of studying Mars in each red flange and dander and follicle. Some nights Mars wants to cloud its face like a flirt, but Lowell won't take no for an answer, not from his own unwavering eye, and not from one of the 70 million miles. He's going to see each crimson pock, and its rim, and its shadow. Though, in truth, tonight he also has another urgent project on his mind. "Oh Mr. Tolliver . . . ," and in a flash Mr. Tolliver is here. He's a perfect associate for Lowell, almost archetypally so: his greatest passion is astronomy; his singlemost allegiance is to Lowell's maverick theories; his hair is a series of bright gray military cleats. Like most of the staff men here, he's normally methodical, and dippish in speech. Tonight he seems more soft than that in his manner, however - abashed, perhaps. "Mr. Tolliver. Is it functioning yet?" It is The Master Unit, a showy telescope with an 84-inch lens, inset with a thermopyle and mounted with a single-prism spectro- graph of Vesto Slipher's invention. While the eyepiece is a dainty thing like a jeweler's loupe (and calculatedly so: The Master Unit is intended to woo the favor of a list of high-profile, influential visitors) the barrel is about as big around as a subway tunnel (this is also calculated for effect). The whole thing comes, by various metal waists and accordian pleats, to rest on four diminutive feet, like those of a portable tray-table. Yet the total effect of the massive, levered and socketed main section, is that of a major city skyline tilted upward at the stars. It's an impressive contrivance, surely; and so it dwindles Mr. Tolliver all the more when he says, "No sir. But we're working at it. We're checking the section relays now." At this, Lowell snorts - a well-bred snort, but a snort. They've checked the circuits and the beam-struts and the inloads and, with something like thirty-six hours remain- ing, he doesn't see now why massaging the goddam section relays is going to do one batshit dash of good. But all he says, composedly, is, "Mr. Tolliver. Please be aware that the press arrives in little over a day. Some may be ... hostile to our position. We are intending to overpower them, you know, by the plain cold facts of it we hope, by bulk and show- manship if necessary." Mr. Tolliver nods, because he does know this, and because Mr. Tolliver always nods when Mr. Lowell speaks, and energetically nods: as if he's check- ing off a list of orders. "Please, Mr. Tolliver. Have the men persevere." Mr. Tolliver leaves. Albert Goldbarth 15</page><page sequence="11">And Lowell is alone again, slumped, fuddled for a moment. Over eighteen years he's made of himself a serious, professional observer of the heavens; though he knows he can be colorful, espousing his ideas, he's no sideshow barker. Yes, but with the constant and indeed increasing volleys of rebuke at his ideas. . . . But then - he is Percival Lowell - he squares his shoulders; also, one time, flicks them, as if shooing off a gnat. And now he's back to his looking, back to his ever- finer-resolving vigil, as still, as steady, as a concrete gargoyle set on his bench. No, that's not true: the eye at the lens is alive, is at its task with a ravenous basilisk-fire. * And what would Louie have been to this man with the family crest and the white wing collar so stiffly starched it might be bas-relief sculpture? Very little. Less than little. Antipathetically little: unrestricted immigration appalled him; once, at least, he spoke against it at a public forum. My grandfather would have been somebody meant for brooming the floors and freshening the cowbarn hay, if that; and only then, if hired third-hand by a recent office lackey unacquainted with the ambience. And still I need to praise the Lowell genealogy here, and enable it forward. Not that his marriage at fifty-three to Constance Savage Keith brought any biological issue - no. But in the metaphoric way in which we use the term, he was the "father" (he would have disowned them, but was provably the father) of the Martians (the "Barsoomians," to use the indigenous language) in eleven novels by Edgar Rice Bur- roughs - and so, unwillingly, the patriarch of the sturdy green line of every insect- eyed, antenna-waving, raygun-wielding extraterrestrial from the saucerfied 1950s to date, that ever landed and indicated take me to your leader. * And Lowell's "father"? - was Schiaparelli. The respected, keen-eyed Giovanni Vir- ginio Schiaparelli. With the usual collaterally ancestral and second-cousin voices of- fering background provocation: Bernard de Fontenelle is opining as early as 1686, "The Earth swarms with inhab- itants. Why then should nature, which is fruitful to an excess here, be so very barren in the rest of the planets?" Why, indeed! Huygens writes a volume of speculations on the citizens of other planets. Kant considers that Earth and Mars, as "the middle links of the planetary system," have inhabitants "that stand in the center between the extremes of physiology, as well as morals." The eighteenth-century astronomer Johann Elert Bode, however, computes by a lucid system of mathematical proportions, that the Martians are considerably more spiritual than their counterparts on Earth. "It is the opinion of all the modern philosophers and mathematicians, that the planets are habitable worlds" - Benjamin Franklin in Poor Richard's Almanack, 1749. In 1784, the King's Astronomer, William Herschel, correctly concludes the white- ness visible over the polar regions of Mars is cap ice - going on to guess that the 16 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="12">beings of Mars "probably enjoy a situation in many respects similar to our own." (Herschel also believed the sun is "richly stored with inhabitants.55) In 1892 the French astronomer (and toast of the town) Camille Flammarion claims "the present inhabi- tation of Mars by a race superior to ours is very probable.55 Three years later, the New York Tribune reports a scribble of certain dark markings across the Martian surface spell out the words "The Almighty55 in Hebrew. Could Mars be attempting a conver- sation with Earth? Then don't just revolve around silently! Plans proposed (and often by highly re- garded minds of the times) include, for instance, the Pythagorean theorem drawn to half the size of Europe on the wastes of the Sahara (or better: dig the theorem, fill these trenches with water, pour on kerosene, and set the theorem gargantuanly on fire); mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss suggests a vaaaaast wheat field, the size of many Rhode Islands, ("wheat because of its uniform color55), shaped to be a right triangle, bordered by pine trees, in Siberia. It5s an age of scientific optimism and mechanical cockiness, writ large. The com- pleted Suez Canal is considered "a wonder of the world,55 and every day in the press the progress of the Panama Canal is debated. Gods are tottering, and the astronomical jots they leave in their vacated places take on burning meaning. Bricklayers, barten- ders, bottle washers: everyone's a dabbler with an ephemeris, and the wunderdabbler sons of the rich especially. Lowell takes a 6-inch telescope when he travels as a young man to Japan. In 1893 he returns to the States with this objective: "nothing less than to build, equip, and staff a major new astronomical observatory in the best possible location,55 to continue the work of the ailing Schiaparelli. It's now sixteen years since that night in Milan when Schiaparelli witnessed the geometric pattern of lines he properly labeled canali. "Channels,55 it meant, though overnight a world gone hungry for worlds was making "canals55 of it - those engi- neered things. * He is conquering Mars; and he is Man's vassal. He is stroking that face like a lover, like a proper Victorian lover, with his gaze alone, from afar. He is the obliging amanuensis, to whom Mars dictates its lines. He is Lowell. He is tired. He is sitting at his bench with the pride of a rajah in his how dab. He is reading the varicose scrabble of that face. He is tired. The night is tired. The deeply-burined lines of Mars are holding it, like a cheese in a net. He is Lowell, he is the saccbadee here, he is going to look, and chart, beyond being tired, what they call athe Red Planef'-yes, that tabasco-glint in his eye. * Eventually - and repeatedly - he would see, and exhaustively sketch for his Annals, 700 canals: "a mesh of lines and dots like a lady's veil.55 The astronomical language is lushly evocative at times- "a twilight arc on the terminator," "limblight,55 "gemina- Albert Goldbarth 17</page><page sequence="13">tion," "albedo and density5' - but data was arrived at in a systematic, dutiful shift at the heavens-scanning tubes. He was indefatigable, and his legacy is as serious as his intent. His early insistence on the importance of atmospheric conditions to findings soon became seminal. His "velocity-shift" technique for spectroscopically determining the composition of other planets' atmospheres became a recognized practice. He was confident a "trans-Nep- tunian planet" existed, "Planet X" he called it; and the first two letters of Pluto stand for Percival Lowell, its harbinger. Under Lowell's influence, Lampland began his at- tempts at direct photography of the planets, and Slipher conducted his observations of spiral galaxies that enabled Hubble's discovery of the universe's expansion. Lowell, everywhere. Lowell at the lectern, in the headlines, by the elbows of the sky-beguiled. "The Roosevelt of astronomy," the New York Times says, in 1907. (And later, when Pluto had been discovered, the limes quotes Keats's sonnet: "Then I felt like some watcher of the skies / When a new planet swims into his ken." - And so Keats enters this essay, a moment only, but he'll be back.) Uranus! Meteor showers! The myste- rious rings of Saturn! But it's Mars on his tongue like the holy wafer, Mars his uncurable bloody cyst. He will helix its skin clean off it, like the sweetest freestone peach. He will devour it like a temptress's cunt. He is Percival Lowell, and this is his Grail. This is his weight, as Earth was for Atlas. This is his weight, he will carry it into clearer understanding. He is Percival Lowell, his telescope is his pool cue, he will strike this ball dead-on and watch the sparks collect in his pocket. He is tired. Sometimes he is very tired. He is its Boswell. He is its weary retiree walking it on a leash of pure vision. Cherry tomato. Pimiento. Slice of cayenne pepper irritating his nights. Sometimes he wakes, he's been scratching a rash across his chest, where his heart is, the color of Mars. * He saw the canals. "Think back on '07," said the Wall Street Journal. ccWhat has been in your opinion the most extraordinary event of the twelve months? . . . not the financial panic which is occupying our minds, but the proof afforded that conscious, intelligent human life exists upon the planet Mars." He saw the canals, he labored. "Lowell's plan of attack was eminently pragmatic. He intended, in effect, to lay telescopic siege to the planet." In 1907 alone, Lowell and Lampland "obtained 3,000 images" of the Martian disc with their early ratchet- and-squeeze-bulb camera. He saw the canals, he proselytized: Mars and Its Canals (1906), and Mars as the Abode of Life (1908). He said, "I believe that all writing should be a collection of precious stones of truth which is beauty." (And so a whisper of Keats is heard amidst the apparatus: Lowell's sister's influence. Amy.) He saw the canals, he understood the message in their webwork. He said, "It is by the very presence of uniformity and precision that we suspect things of artificiality. The better we see these lines the more regular they look. The intrinsic probability of 18 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="14">such a state of things arising from purely natural causes becomes evident on a mo- ment's consideration. That life inhabits Mars now is the only rational deduction from the observations in our presence. Think of the intelligence and far-contrivance nec- essary to execute and maintain a system of irrigation worldwide!" He saw the canals, as a child at Miss Fette's Boston school for the Brahmin heirs, that lady of stria comportment leaned above him with her lavender-gargled breath and said, "This is very charming, Percival, but here where you tell us I fell down you employ the word down gratuitously: one cannot fall up? but he knows better, every night since 1894 he's fallen, helpless Alice, up that wonderland rabbit hole without bottom. He saw the canals, his namesake Percival Lowle also pioneered "the New World." He saw the canals, in 1907 the London Daily News said, "He is the greatest authority on Mars we have," (the year my grandfather Louie woke up mapping in his travel- baffled head the rfr^-infected streets of the Lower East Side of New York). "These delicate features," said Percival Lowell. These are the canals, chimeric and none the less quantifiable, for which, in 1894 - in the Arizona Territory, near Flagstaff, in sight of the San Francisco Mountains, on a mesa at an altitude of more than 7,000 feet, in Coconino County, on the Coconino Plateau, "far from the smoke of men" - he built a "fitting portal to communion with another world." The gods are wind and death and thunder and the buttery slime of birth, the gods are light and perception, light and darkness, darkness and fires-inside-the-flesh. In 1907 Natalie Curtis published The Indians' Book. She says, "At a Navajo healing ceremony in some hogan where there is sickness, the steady rhythm of the medicine- songs pulses all night long. These songs ('Hozhonji songs') describe a journey to a holy place beyond the sacred mountains where are everlasting life and blessedness. The Divine Ones who live in and beyond the mountains made the songs. . . ." And made this world, of fevered skin and thinning game and corn and wolves and ambi- tions and spittle and burials and pollen, a world interpenetrable with Theirs. And for the Hopi, as well, the deific dwells in the mountains. "The Kachinas are somewhat analogous to gods or nature spirits," says Edward T. Hall. "They live with the people for half of the year and return to their home in the San Francisco Moun- tains (north of Flagstaff, Arizona) for the remaining six months." Do the Hopi make love? Do they sob? Do they stand on their sandstone mesas, mazily lost in regarding the star-beaded black doth of night? Of course. And yet their universe is fundamentally other from mine. "No past, present, or future exists as verb tenses in their language. Hopi verbs have no tenses, but indicate instead the validity of a state- ment. Hopi seasons are treated more like adverbs. Summer is a condition', hot." There is no word that corresponds to "time," and Hall describes the Hopi as "living in the eternal present." Now the maidens have gathered wild sunflower petals from the mesa at the lip of the kiva, the underground ceremonial chamber. Now they wet their faces. Now they Albert Goldbarth 19</page><page sequence="15">dust themselves with golden powder ground from the petals. Now the Lagon and Oaqol dances begin. . . . The gods touch our lives: the sky is a membrane. The gods announce themselves: our dreams are a hearing trumpet. Call the Great Ones down from the Mountain, Call the Great Ones down From Sisnajinni, from the Chief of Mountains! - "communion with another world." * This is the place, the spirit, that moved Herriman so deeply, its presence is verbally homaged and clearly if cartoonily cartouched throughout his other, and more daily, love: the Krazy Kat strip. "Herriman made many trips into the Indian country of Northern Arizona. He stayed at Kayenta, on the Navajo Reservation, with John and Louisa Weatherill, at the trading post they had opened there in 1910. Through them, Herriman came to know the country in all its moods and facets. Krazy Rat's Coconino has the spacious- ness and airiness of the high northern desert. In this vast space Herriman places in- digenous mesas, buttes, lunatic cacti, tumbleweeds, blue bean bushes, rock forma- tions, adobe houses, shifting and changing like mirages. He scatters pots, rugs and Mexican and Indian decorative devices; the latter even appear on trees, clouds, or any other props necessary to his stage. One Sunday page depicts Krazy sleeping next to a traditional Navajo loom, on which she has just woven a 'febric' That's the country I love,3 said Herriman, 'and that's the way I see it.' "He said that when he passed on he and his dogs would roam that place for a thousand years." * In whatever atemporal pneuma exists, that holds the populous Native American pantheon in its travel from the San Francisco Mountains to the beckoning of women and men . . . the Healers, the Beneficent Ones, who hover about the path of the Great Corn Plant: Sun Bearer, Talking God, even little Dontso the spirit messenger-fly, and the rest ... are being called by the ancient chants, to the sick boy's side and, having arrived, being immanent now in the world of tooth and salt, they start their super- natural doctoring. . . . And Herriman has Krazy say, simply: "In my Kosmis, there will be no feeva of discord." * "Mars Hill," as Lowell dubbed the mesa. "Site eleven" is what it had been in the earliest days, when he was also considering "1) The desert of Gobi 2) the veldt of the Transvaal 3) the Samoan Islands." 2O NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="16">The seeing here, it seems, has always been good. We know that in 1054 ad a supernova appeared "just above and to the left of a crescent moon," as Evan Connell puts it. "European intellectuals failed to report the guest star" but "a pictograph showing a cross with a crescent moon just beneath it and to the right35 (datable by potsherds to - correct! - the eleventh century) "was found on the wall of Navajo Canyon in Arizona." 1912. Ifs dawn. Well, it's a little before: the air along the desert horizon isn't yet touched by light, no, but is emptying itself, by imperceptible gradations, of darkness. Lowell hasn't slept. He loves this moment, when the Earth becomes as real for him as Mars has been, and he packs that latter planet away inside himself like a red cor- puscle. Lowell, his 'scopes, his entry-books. We know, we tell ourselves we know, the universe is infinityfoliate; nothing should surprise us. Yes, but can it be, that the mesa of the Navajo gods, and the telescope- poking "site eleven," exist coeval in space-time, with their separate dreams occurring on this same one physical sandstone x? . . . The scholar of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Martian novels, John Flint Roy, says, "Car- ter's description of the planet differs in some respects from that given by our Earth scientists. Thus, we feel compelled to assume that Barsoom and Mars are not one and the same; rather, that the former occupies the same place as the latter but in another dimension - the Barsoomian dimension." Seated at home behold me, Seated amid the rainbow, Seated at home behold me, Lo, here, the Holy Place! Another night of observation is over. Lowell rubs his face, as if his hands were roughly-nubbed towels. A cup of hot tea is waiting for him, and a shaving of Boston rum cake. "Mr. Tolliver is making a final check just now." It's Langland speaking. His eyes rove toward the door. Beyond it, Tolliver is desperately attempting to placate the obdurate coven of gremlins that are fucking up The Master Unit. Lampland smiles - Slipher the Elder is to his left, Slipher the Younger is at his right, and they smile as well. But Lampland's voice is a sieve out of which all hope has dribbled. "Gentlemen. Very well." By now it's full-tilt dawn, though these four men are oblivious to its mercurial silvers and desert tangerines. They're grouped in Lowell's study. He plays with a rumpled telegram on his desk; its greeting peeks out, hail. His fingers crease his lower lip. It's like watching an I-beam fidget. "It may be in the next few hours Fate will reward us with greater luck. For now, however, we best had expect disappointment. You know, of course, our visitors sent from Mr. Hearst arrive at noon. And scheduled for later, at three," and now he glances at the telegram, "my sister arrives on the afternoon Atlantic and Pacific stop . . ." and he trails off, unsure of what to say. Perhaps they need preparing for this? Albert Goldbarth 21</page><page sequence="17">"My sister, gentlemen. . . ." Yes? They wait. A look of mingled love and embar- rassment suddenly shadows his face. And then he says by way of explanation - he's speaking to three grown men who live alone in a dome in the desert counting planets and stars like fireflies in a jar - he says, as if he were speaking to any middle-class family at its breakfast table, "You should know. . . . My sister Amy is . . ." almost, he pities them ". . . truly an eccentric." 3- The President of Harvard University, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, is at his desk. The desk is a fine-grained wonder, about the size of a small-town plaza, and as lustrous as a mountie's boot at dress parade. Even the desktop humidor is expansive, it could coddle a couple of preemies, and its lid is ivory and cloisonné fretted into a Byzantine pattern. From the walls, the money and minds of two generations of stiff-necked Boston patriarchs stare down unblinkingly, stern (if money), owlish (if mind). The phone looks like an obsidian monument, freshly waxed. And the man behind the desk is the man - his every gesture says this: he is a Lowell - who is capable of answering such a phone. "President Lowell " "Yes, Miss Supwich." "I have a caller here," and Miss Supwich's voice says that this is a call she's accepted the way she might a rotten kipper, by two reluctant fingers and with her nose averted, "who claims an emergency. Shall I. . . ." "Yes. Please transfer the call, Miss Supwich. Thank you." "Yes sir." Click. Mmph. "Go ahead, sir." "Right. Y'er Mr. Lowell?" "I am, sir." "The Haaabvard Mr. Lowell?" "The same, sir." "Well then. I'm out the Bay Roadway by Lowsley. Rummle. Eb Rummle. I repair cars, and I've jest repaired a Pierce Arrow broke down here early this mornin. The lady driver is a big fat dame who says I should charge the bill to you - she bein your sister. So. Do I have yer permission?" Let me interrupt this anecdote for a minute. Let's look at that scandalous and bat- tleship-plated woman. * She was nicknamed The Postscript - Percy's idea. She was the last of five, by a lag of twelve years, so the sobriquet was a natural. Now there were seven Lowells under the roof, and they named the manor in Brookline, Massachusetts "Sevenels." Here she was born; and fifty-one years later, here her ruptured body let go of its cantan- kerous tank-like ghost. This was the house of America's home-grown aristocracy, and in its rooms she comfortably grew into her birthright privilege. The private schools. The private coach 22 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="18">(the coachman let her hold the reins once when she was three). The subsidized pub- lishing of her fairy tales. Lessons at Papanti's, the - no: The - young ladies' school of dance in Boston. The European tour (she was eight). At a dinner party, when she was five, Longfellow "carried me around the table in a scrap-basket, and the recollec- tion of that ride is as vivid as though it were yesterday." The adult who burst from this chrysalis was, not surprisingly, lavish and willful. "To argue with her," Carl Sandburg said, "is like arguing with a big blue wave." The day she stood at the forum to veto retaining a cherished but senile school board member, she was hissed, but she was hearkened to; no other Lowell woman had ever spoken in public before. And when she lectured on "Some Musical Analogies in Mod- ern Poetry," Amy Lowell became the first woman to give a talk at Harvard. Maids were tossed away like matchsticks. Waiters vied in predicting her wants like adepts at the Buddha's side. Her father died in 1900; she bought Sevenels and began its Amyfication. Chinese wallpaper. Whistler. Monet. Commissioned Egyptian scenes. The sweeping central staircase that was "carpeted in glowing crimson stair-silk woven to order." Every doorknob on the estate was sterling silver. Japanese stone carvings. Persian rugs. Venetian masks. A sixteenth-century crystal chandelier. Enameled snuffboxes (Paris), elfin music boxes (Lausanne). Two huge white caststone lions standing guard at the gate. Her English sheepdogs (whelped from Ringlow's Sultan, a "champion of record," and Flo) were awarded free run of this rarefied domain; each day these seven ate ten pounds of top-round beef with flanking mounds of fresh mashed vegetables. After dinner, gathered around the fireplace in the library, guests at Sevenels were ritually handed turkish bath towels, as an interceding between their laps and the freely-offered slobber. Her custom-built Pierce Arrow limousine (which we've encountered, waiting repairs by Lowsley) was maroon, and her chauffeur and footman were consequently liveried in maroon to match. Magenta, though, she abhorred, and "no magenta flower was ever allowed in her garden." She wrote all night, and woke in her third-floor bedroom at two in the afternoon. And then she'd ring a series of bells for the downstairs rooms, beginning the daily Sevenels procession: Ada, her live-in love, with the mail; the housekeeper, bringing a pitcher of ice water; Amy's wardrobe maid; the parlor maid (bearing packages); and the kitchen maid with the breakfast tray. Additionally, the staff included a third maid, a houseboy, a butler, a cook, two secretaries, a gardener, seven undergardeners (watchful, one supposes, for the least magenta interference), a laundress, and the aforementioned blendingly-uniformed chauffeur (or sometimes two chauffeurs) and footman. One biography adds: "A man came weekly to wind the clocks." This ambience of retinue and particularized intinerary accompanied her on her trav- els. "She always refused to stay at private houses, but put up at the best possible hotel, where she required a suite of five rooms, in addition to a room for the maid some- where else in the building. All electric clocks had to be stopped; all mirrors and other shining objects were swathed in folds of black cloth; the housekeeper saw that exactly sixteen pillows, chosen for plumpness, were pefectly set across the royal bed." Once, when the pillows were flabby some gastrically-restless night, "she ripped two of them Albert Goldbarth 23</page><page sequence="19">open, and transferred the feathers from one into the other." On a train to Milwaukee, wanting fresh air, she "made the porter bring and hold a ladder while she clumbered up and broke one of the small glass panes near the roof." Her idealogical luggage was of a piece with this imperiousness. The industrial looms of Lowell, Massachusetts enabled her family's philanthropies. The pattern of her life, in a sense, was woven by the arduous, humpbacked, fifty-four-hour weeks there; and this, like the seasons, or gravity, was something fit and unquestioned. "Haughty, class-conscious, high-minded," C. David Heymann calls her. She believed the Lowells among an elect "who had the right to carry their coat of arms." She gave up smoking a pipe, in part, because of its association with "shanty Irish women." Union organizing was in the air, and the Suffragist movement. But Amy Lowell could blithely refer to "the ignorant proletariat." She's on record declaiming "I have no patience with the new-fashioned woman and her so-called rights. I believe in the old-fashioned conservative woman and all of her limitations." She spoke against re- taining the maiden name in marriage. Wobblies were monsters. London bobbies were, above all other duties, for hailing her cabs. Outmoded elevation, her view has become the one poets rally against. It leaves her with her verses, on a promontory, crooning to the Muses, while the rest of the planet turns willingly back to regarding its inequities and fractures. She "devoured," one source says, Dickens; "all of Dickens," says another. Presum- ably she enjoyed, she agreed or she thought she agreed, with Dickens; it's impossible to picture someone finishing those many thousands of tightly-grouted pages as an exercise in argument. Yes, but - what did she think, when all of his smudged and crumpled-up children entered another demeaning day of factory work? when all of those wadded and tossed-away women, nearly bruised to the look of maps, slipped into the night from their laborers' shacks? The mansions of England, like so many termite queens, are clearly being fed by the energies of some of the author's most charming (and most pitiable) protagonists. What frisson ran through her, reading these things? What necessary obtuseness keeps a world undefiled by neighboring worlds? We want to like her - it's one am, she's slick with the chrism of poetry madness, seeking The One Right Word, beseeching the Heavens for it, pouring her hurt on the page, like you, like me, her pen a magical but frightening wand, like anyone's. We want to be able to knock the rest of it onto its dinosaur ass for a moment and simply, purely, like her. Maybe if we could see Amy Lowell the child. * She was five, and lonely. Her father was forty-nine, and remote. But Percy, at least, played jacks with her, and lifted her up to pat the row of carved animal heads, or looked in on the dolls made out of chicken wishbones with sealing-wax faces. Com- pared to the other, stiffer Lowell males, he was streaked with occasional playfulness, and he became a combination idealized-older-brother-cww-supervisory parent (later, 24 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="20">her earliest urges toward a published book would be "to emulate and surpass" his Mars). "I dare you!" Percy said at a family party. Amy was eight. She'd zested her way through a giant plate of rice pudding, and now was eyeing a second plate - which also disappeared, and when it was time to leave, her coat wouldn't button across her middle. "And," she wrote, "it never buttoned again." Oh she was ponderous! At twenty she was barely five feet tall but weighed 250 pounds. Oh she was a ponderous, square-rigged, bunker-built thing! - A glandular, uncorrectable condition. She needed to twist her body when round- ing the turns of the spiral stairway. Alice Lowell remembers being a child at a family dinner when Amy barged in "perfectly enormous in a vast gold dress cut tent-style." And biographer Jean Gould: Amy was "a female Henry VIII," she had "the soul of a sylph but the body of a hippopotamus." "Hippopoetess," Pound said (Witter Bynner, in another version): cruel for its being lopsidedly true. "Squat," "swollen," "stunted," "barrel-chested" . . . this chapter of her life is little more than a thesaurus for her bulk. It shows most painfully in the diary she began to keep in 1889. She's fifteen, self- tormented, disclosing to its pages "I am ugly, fat, conspicuous, and dull. Oh Lord please let it be all right, and let Paul H. love me, and don't let me be a fool." But "Paul H." didn't love her. None of them loved her; the world was full of swan-necked debs. "I don't think that being all alone, in here, is good for me." And "I am doomed, for how can it be different-? to see the man I love marry somebody else." And "I am doomed to be a dreadful pill; doomed to visibly blush, and waste my sweetness in the vicinity of the wall." And "I was a fool- as usuall a great rough masculine thing! But Paul! Oh! Goodnight!" The entry for January 13, 1889: "What would I not give to be a poet. Well day- dreams are day-dreams, &amp; I never shall be. . . ." * "And nightly," says the very chunky study of her by S. Foster Damon, "she re- corded faithfully the phase of the moon." Whatever darkness ran through her life was somewhat alleviated by this lifelong, literal lunacy. A full-plate moon with a garnish of cloud . . . A camemberts rind . . . A cameo . , . Many nights it must have been the closest face she knew. * Her best friends in her childhood were her books, and "dearest of all" was the one called Moon-folk. Here, "a lonely little girl makes the acquaintance of a chimney-elf"- Albert Goldbarth 25</page><page sequence="21">and under his guidance, Rhoda drifts in a dory away to sea, then to the moon, where "all the persons of child literature, even to King Arthur and his knights," declare her welcome. It's easy to see why this was antidotal. From then, the moon is a benign and serial punctuation. In California "I woke up in the night and the moon was beautiful." In Venice "We are having a moon, the very best moon that ever was, and we 'gondle' way out into the lagoon." In Egypt her boat, "a little dot of a thing only 75 ft. long" - a dababeab - is named Chonsu, after the God of the rising moon, and "the moonlight on the Nile is more beautiful than any I have seen." It cuts its zags of liquid silver in the river chop, and each one for an instant is a chain, a badge, a ritual scimitar blade, for this devotee. Its totemic presence lights her work from the first poem of her first book (". . . the moon / Swings slow across the sky, / Athwart a waving pine . . .") - athwart) - to the posthumous Pulitzer-sanctioned collection ("A red moon leers beyond the lily- tank. A drunken moon ogling a sycamore, / Running long fingers down its shining flank . . ."). The poems are steeped in moon-brew. Quite likely, the poems would not have been written without the moon. Because in 1891, when she was seventeen, and crying out with the ripeness of being seventeen, ajumble inside and neglected ... the moon introduced her to someone. * O Moon! old boughs lisp forth a holier din The while they feel thy airy fellowship. Thou dost bless every where, with silver lip Kissing dead things to life. The sleeping kine, Couch'd in thy brightness, dream of fields divine . . . . . . and the "nested wren," and the "patient oyster" . . . everywhere, that utterly transforming, magisterial touch. It's Keats, of course, in Endymion - a moonray is stirring his psychic quick into a rich Romantic lather. Douglas Bush reminds us "that poet and persona are one" in this poem, that "from his boyhood the moon had represented and consecrated all that Endymion loved and aspired to - nature, wisdom, poetry, friends, great deeds. . . ." She had a confidante now, a mentor. They shared the secret sign and handshake. She's walked out holding the moon in her eyes, this needy budding woman-child, and found a fellow cultist. Jean Gould: "The effect of Endymion especially was like balm to her turbulent spir- its. The erotic narrative clarified for her the relative values of the physical and spiritual in love and, fusing the two elements into one, showed her that both are essentially pure. The love scene in the second canto affected her for days: 'How many boys and girls have found solace and joy in this passage!' Her literary discoveries freed her from the prison of her body." 26 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="22">* The format of her own first book was copied from that of Keats's 1820 volume Lamia; the title, A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass, is brazenly taken from Shelley's elegy for Keats; and two poems frankly conjure him - "He spurns life's human friendships to profess / Life's loneliness of dreaming ecstasy." "I do not believe," she said, "that there is a person in the world who knows John Keats better than I do." Eventually she amassed the largest collection of Keatsiana in private hands, including the first edition of Lamia inscribed "F.B. from J.K.," Keats's presentation copy to Fanny Brawne, and - just as examples - the first drafts of "Eve of St. Agnes," "Ode to Autumn," and "On First Looking Into Chapman's Homer." Damon claims that her monumental biography of Keats "took four years of her life and hastened her death." Overdramatic a statement or not, it's true that by then she was being broken apart by obesity, high blood pressure, hernia, sporadic gastritis, retina deterioration, and cardiac trouble. She finished the volume only after blood vessels burst in both of her eyes. Two volumes, actually: a total of 1,300 pages. In her posthumous collection he's still with her, still the champion who healed her with his Endymion: Well, John Keats, I know how you felt when you swung out of the inn And started up Box Hill after the moon. Lord! How she twinkled in and out of the box bushes Where they arched over the path. How she peeked at you and tempted you, And how you longed for the "naked waist" of her You had put into your second canto. Did he lay his fevered head against hers, although he'd been dead for seventy years, and the fluid moon poured back and forth between them, as if from one flask to another) Yes, he lay his fevered head against hers, although he'd been dead for seventy years, and the fluid moon poured back and forth between them, as if from one flask to another. * Ask Louie, ask Rosie, they'll tell you: you can't talk moon, without dragging in the battered, baggage-filled heart. After Egypt she visited Rome, to see the house in which Keats died, "and wor- shipped in true disciple form before its barred gateway." It's tempting, too, to leave her here- a white-robed keg-shaped pilgrim at the Temple of the Moon, performing her devotions. But the anecdotes about this high-tone moxie-powered swaggerer of poetry are too, too good. My favorite occurs on the Chonsu: seventeen experienced, toughened Albert Goldbarth 27</page><page sequence="23">Egyptian sailors arc taking five supposedly helpless American women up the Nile. It's the job of the seasoned "cataract Arabs" to haul the dahabeah over the dangerous rapids. And this, with much rolling of eyes and imploring of extra bakhsheesh, they do - until the especially hazardous rapids near Philae, on the downriver return - and here they balk in a histrionic donkey-like show of recalcitrance. Let the squawky American she-sow empty her purse, if she wants this done! And what the American she-sow does? - she rolls her sleeves up, glowers fixedly at the dahabeah as if it's a bad dog needing a firm newspaper whack across the snout - and then she "stepped out and hoisted and hauled it to shore herself." Now thafs Amy Lowell! That, and the stogies. In a world in which the smoking of even cigarettes by the distaff sex was rigorously taboo (and, under New York's "Sullivan Ordinance," illegal) Amy Lowell was famous for publicly and profusely puffing away on her trademark Manila cigars. When the threat of a World War also threatened to halt her regular supply of these, she ordered a special humidor built, something like the casket for a Pope, and stockpiled ten thousand at once. Well, Abbott Lowell asks by way of logical ascertainment, what's the "big fat dame" of a lady driver doing at the moment? "She's across the road here, sittin on a stone wall, smokin herself a cigar." "In that case," President Lowell informs Mr. Rummle, "you may charge the bill. That is, I assure you, my sister." * In 1913 the "International Exhibition of Modern Art" will open at Armory Hall in New York - the "Armory Show" - and the staid, complacent surface of America's taste for realism will shirr and besquiggle and muckle itself in disturbing (and irre- vocable) ways: Cubism, Post-Impressionism, Futurism, the fleshy glissando-like cyl- inder-glide of "Nude Descending a Staircase" by Duchamp, Brancusi's simplified fe- tish figures, Matisse's jazzy patterns . . . Slurs and lauds! Excitement and contumely! Nothing will be the same again. And as a footnote to these artsy upheavals of 1913, Amy Lowell (and maid and limousine and chauffeur) will travel to London, there to take up residency in the posh top-floor retreat of the Berkeley Hotel (as always, masking her pangs with swank); and will visit (her singular purpose in being here) the tiny second-floor flat at 10 Church Walk, where the expatriate American Ezra Pound conducts his bohemian poetry masterminding. He will already have heard of her coming: she has stormed herself into the offices of Constable's, the publishers, and demanded to know, in her brassiest manner, why she doesn't see copies of A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass in the bookstores here. She thinks she will remain in the publisher's office until the books are found, unpacked, and distributed, thank you very much. And she, of course, will have heard of this thorny spade-faced American maestro of "the new poetry," who has almost single-handedly invented (and is frenetically busy proselytizing) Imagism, who one night read a sestina for the "Poet's Club" at a res- 28 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="24">taurant in Soho "whereupon," said Glenn Hughes, "the entire cafe trembled." She will want the secrets to Imagism; will suffer his wheedling funds from her, and his cant. He will prune her writing of those athwarts, he will chill it clean with a dose of the hard no-nonsense brook-ice of his credo. She will read a new poem of hers at a dinner party, and at its most aqueous moment ("Splashing down moss-tarnished steps / It falls, the water; / And the air is throbbing with it . . .") he will enter the room with a miniature tin bathing tub for a helmet over his head. She will call him "thin-skinned." He will say "Aw shucks!" and brand her poetry "putrid." They will flatter and snipe and fortify their respective sides of what Heymann slyly calls "the ongoing skirmishes of the great poetry war." Meanwhile, the other world, with its butcher saws and tribunals, continues its spin. The Archduke of Austria is assassinated. Austria-Hungary issues its forty-eight-hour ultimatum to Siberia, and five days later declares war. In a few days more, Great Britain follows. Amy Lowell will see it all take place: "A great crowd of people with flags marched down Piccadilly, shouting We want war! We want war!3 They sang the Marseillaise, and it sounded savage, abominable. The blood-lust was coming back, which we had hoped was gone forever from civilized races." It turns out, the worlds of our little day-to-day love and competitiveness are gerbil-wheels in larger wheels, in infrastruc- ture of cosmologie proportion, not Ptolemy, Einstein, or Hawking can wholly cartograph. She will come to know and befriend the British poet Rupert Brooke ("perhaps the most notable British poet of his time"). She will attend his reading at London's Poetry Bookshop ("Louder! Louder!" she calls, at his indistinct delivery). Two months later he'll be dead in the trenches in France. But that's all in the future, though the immediate future. Right now it's 1912. Rob- ert Frost is sprawled on the floor of his temporary home in rural England, winnowing poems from the raggedy sheaf of poems that will be his first book. Robinson Jeffers, Vachel Lindsay, Joyce Kilmer, Elinor Wylie, Ezra Pound, and Edna St. Vincent Mil- lay, are first breaking into print. In Paris, Picasso and Braque are busy upping the ante in a private back-and-forth in which they're making the very small but revolutionary step of incorporating printed commercial lettering and design (for instance, cut-up newspaper headlines) into their paintings: Picasso's Table with Bottle, Wineglass and Newspaper (each of the first three drawn, and the fourth a pasted patch of actual front-page newspaper). Gopnick and Varnedoe say "the private innovations of Braque and Picasso's little conversation in 1912 became, by a few intermediary steps and within a decade, a signal part of the official public language of a nation." And, in Chicago, Miss Harriet Monroe is piecing together the initial issue of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse, that will appear September 1912. Ezra Pound is on the masthead as "foreign editor." Eliot, Williams, Hilda Dolittle, Stevens will soon appear in its pages. Amy Lowell receives a solicitation of money and poems. Albert Goldbarth 29</page><page sequence="25">A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass is published in 1912. Its first year out, it sells just eighty copies. Louis Untermeyer, writing in the Chicago Evening Post, says that the book "to be brief, in spite of its lifeless classicism, can never rouse one's anger. But, to be briefer still, it cannot rouse one at all." That year, the textile workers of Lawrence and Lowell stage a record-breaking two-month strike. The Lowells are painted as money-minded, whip-wielding robber barons. The State Police kill two mill workers in cold blood. Everything's shattering, each day is a rare plate thrown at the wall. She locks herself in her third-floor bedroom, hugging her walrusy self, ashamed that she's weeping - but weeping. It's midnight and she stares at the sky with the emptied-out face of a wax museum statue. Gloom and griping; barrel-chested Amy going over the falls. . . . But she knows someone who - guaranteed - will rejuvenate her, someone she hasn't seen for years, and never in his own far headquarters; someone who can rub away this recent sickly moss. She sends a telegram: hail marsoleum stop expect YOUR SCRIVENER SIBLING SATURDAY 3PM TRAIN STOP IN NEED OF A FAMILY FROLIC STOP WILL TRADE YOU STANZAS FOR STARS STOP POSTSCRIPT. Maybe he'll even show her her moon. * But Percival Lowell isn't sure that any of his guests arriving later this afternoon will be able to see so much as a hardboiled egg held three feet away from The Master Unit's unresponsive eye. He stares at Slipher and Slipher and Lampland, there in his study, from the middle of a mood that's slumping quickly into despondency. Then, from the observatory, they hear a tinny shriek. Tolliver rushes in: "It's working!" They gape at him in disbelief. "Mr. Tolliver . . ." he's almost afraid to ask it directly "... am I to understand that you have repaired The Master Unit?" "Yes sir! Well, no. I didn't repair it," and now some hesitancy stipples poor Tolliv- er's uniform rush of pleasure, "but somebody, . . ." Tolliver looks from Slipher to Sli- pher to Lampland; none of the three responds. "Well, somebody shimmed it, sir, and now it's working, I tell you!" "Shimmed it, Mr. Tolliver?" - as if he might be saying in public masturbated or butt- fucked, "Uh, yes sir. Shimmed it. You know, sir: like when you set a chip of wood or a matches box beneath the uneven leg of a. . . ." "Yes, Mr. Tolliver. I understand the concept. Gentlemen," waving his hand like a gracious host on a house tour, "let us see." Yes, there's the observatory. There, in its center, probing toward the heavens like an altar unto the gods, is The Master Unit. And under one of its dainty, exquisite legs is the current issue of All-Story. "Under the Moons of Mars!" the cover blurts. June 1912. "Mr. Tolliver." "Yes sir?" "Would you be so good as to bring the custodian's assistant in here?" 3O NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="26">4- "At once, upon hearing the blood-chilling scream of a female voice in that haunted scene, I commenced to bound across the crimson sward of those dead sea-bottoms with the giant leaps allowed my Earthly muscles by the weaker Barsoomian gravity. At the first, my longsword was in my hand, prepared for any contingency, no matter how savage, for mingled with those piteous screams I had heard the exultant, throaty growl of the great white ape of Barsoom. "The growls continued as I neared the toppled, overgrown columns and crumbling public walls of the ruin of one of those long-ago abandoned port cities that sporad- ically dot these wastes. The woman's screams, however, had ceased, and I feared that, even now, I might be too late to free her from the fate that awaits the luckless Bar- soomian maiden who falls prey to these beasts. The thought that she might be, was almost surely, my beloved, increased both the fear and the urgency of my mad dash. 'The two moons, Cluros and Thuria, leant their eerie double shadows to the night. When at last I had frantically searched through what seemed to me to be half of the caved-in buildings of that formerly glorious city, I came upon my objective. The great white ape was towering above the curled-up form of a woman whose sheer, ripped silks revealed a body bruised and scratched, but quivering yet with life. Her face was turned from me, but who she was, and how she came to be here, were questions that needed their asking delayed, for now I confronted this interrupted, thus doubly-en- raged, representative of the most feared of the dead-sea-bottom creatures. "The great white ape stands ten feet tall, hairless except for a shock of bristly for upon his head. Its snout and teeth are not unlike the Earth gorilla's, although millen- nia of cruelty have given these an especially devilish aspect. An intermediary set of arms is located midway between its upper and lower limbs - altogether, a very un- pleasant opponent. This one carried a cudgel, and no sooner had I entered the vast ruined hallway where it had dragged its prey, than its club and my sword were ad- versaries swirling through the night for blood. "The details of that battle I cannot recall, so swiftly and confosingly did they take place. I know I was wounded once on the shoulder, and I know I gave back more than I received. When it was over, and that giant body lay damp and still at my feet, I leaped to the corner, and kneeled worriedly at the side of the terror-struck woman, and then turned her face to the moons' light. "'Louie Louie Louie. Vhy do you think soch thinks?' "'Rosie?' "'Yah, of course, Rosie. Who else? A Princess from outer spaces maybe?' "'Oh no, no But- kvick, before more of the apes return, I must rescue you!' "'Louie. Look around, Louie. You're the vun needs the rescue. Yah?'" * My grandfather milked the cow. Her name was Venus, a patchy thing of white with licorice spotting. He liked her fleshy good looks, she had Poland written all over her. Satellite, the calf, explored the fenced-in demi-pasture in woozy figure eights. Albert Goldbarth 31</page><page sequence="27">The milking shed was cool. On days when the sun was like a red injection of army ants under his skin, he'd come to the grayly lavender shade of the shed, and press the dented tin of the empty pail against his forehead. He'd hum. He'd squeeze the ivory withes of milk from her udder, and pretend it was a bagpipes of a sort, and he'd hum some popular tune he'd picked up in town, "The Inky-Tink Song" or "A Soldier's Light" or "Gay Plantation Slippers," or some- times a Polish children's counting-rhyme, "Chicken-Câbbage-Chicken." But the love songs, either au courant or folkloric, he refrained from humming. He didn't want to think about love. And even so, he daydreamed. Sometimes her face was so tightly pressed against his own, and he was so open to this, that when something startled him out of that world, he thought he'd find himself impressed like dough or wet clay. And occasionally - not often, but occasionally - a female guest stayed overnight at the Main House: men are men, after all, he reasoned, even if they do devote themselves to something so fantastically diddleheaded as counting the stars. He was too polite and (let's face it) unwanted, to sidle up to these slim, pastel, frilled visitors for a drinking-in of their otherness. But he'd see them from the toolshed or the pasture as they breakfasted on the piazza. Then, the usual hobnailed sentences that stomped through the air of Mars Hill - "Oh dammit, Lampland, I told you the arc declined by seven degrees!" - became the silkier, trilled communiqués of "Do you haaave to get back to those silly charts?" (the eyelashes almost audibly bat- ting around the words, like a flock of birds) or "Honey, you can stop looking - I found the hat pins!" Hot pants, my grandfather heard. * O sovereign power of love! O grief! O balm! All records, saving thine, come cool, and calm, And shadowy, through the mist of passed years: For others, good or bad, hatred and tears Have become indolent; but touching thine, One sign doth echo, one poor sob doth pine . . . Etc. etc. etc. Ask Louie. Ask Keats, Who looks back to his page now and completes These lines from Endymion (that I quote above To demonstrate the brotherhood of love). * His room in what they called "the netherworld" of the enclave was small and spare, but fit his purposes. By its very plainness, it was like blank canvas; every day, in his mind, he tried to paint a believable future across it. Every evening, when the work was done and the last freefloating smatter of the mesa's sun was snuffed by dusk, he untied the satchel in which he kept a "barbershop 32 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="28">magazine": its cover featured a famous New York dancehall girl in a waspwaist corset, her stockings were unrolled to the knee. He lit a cigarette, and leaned lazily back. His smoke became the smoky air of the hall in which she performed. . . . And every morning he lifted out, from beneath his pillow, the pamphlet of shacbris, mincha and mahriv prayers. You could barely say it still existed: he could hold it to the morning light and see his fingers through it, like fish in turbid water. But the Word of God had been poured forth from shakier vessels than this. It served its secular purpose too: as once it connected him back to Mother Poland, now it kept him tied to those earliest days on the Lower East Side, when the skin of his skin was goose- fleshed alive every second with misery, burning hopes, and lovetussle over a floor of chicken feathers. . . . It didn't matter, the barbershop girl or the Holy Word Itself, he came to see it all led back to this Rosie. More and more, want to or not, her face was painted, in his mind, over the blank walls of Arizona. * Smuddle was his immediate supervisor; Smuddle was "groundskeeper," he reported to Meacham, "observatory assistant." Meacham reported to C. V. Tolliver. The men liked Louie, he was "okay." A little too foreign, yes, and he kept to himself. But he could take a joke. His accent alone was a rootietoot hoot that could lilt the most boring of conversations. And he could fix anything- anything. Smuddle told Mea- cham, and Meacham told Tolliver, how this Louis fellow had never bun behind an automotorcar's wheel before, but Smuddle unfolded the Dracula's-cape-like hood of his dormant machine and this whatVhis-name, Louis, intuitively knew, he knew, and fifteen minutes later it was running again. So I gave him a package of cigarettes. What Louie thought of them&gt; In a way, they were lesser gods serving The Great God Lowell. Louie would daily see him in the Mars Hill garden, tending with a paternal air to his justly-famous, robust squashes and pumpkins (Louie wasn't allowed in the garden, but would keep its row of tools in clean, tight, regimental readiness). Taxis swooped down for these people like golden chariots out of clouds. Photogra- phers begged for admission. They seemed to live in some ever-scintillating effluvium, spangled with planets and stars. They made The-Man-Who-Owned-All-Of-Forman- Street look like a shoeshine boy by contrast. And yet, they were children. They laughed at such simple things, they bickered like boys in gymnasium choosing up teams. They could use the 2-gauge tightening swivel, then set it down, and it would be lost for hours ("Slipher, have you seen . . .&gt;"). They lived in dreams, their heads would disappear in the sky for days on end, like creatures out of fable, or like five-year-olds under the tablecloth, in a magic domain, thinking nobody else can see them. My grandfather knew, Der kholemer iz a nar, The dreamer's a fool. He shook his own head, he tsked at them fondly. Meacham offered him cigarettes. Mostly, he was ignored. They gave him little more heed than he gave the turquoise gyroscope of flies around Venus's rump. He wan- dered, benign himself and unmolested in turn, past windows, through offices, around Albert Goldbarth 33</page><page sequence="29">the Black Forest of dials and wires that fed the observatory, he watched them cater like priests to the needs of The Master Unit. Tolliver told him a joke once, a woman and a bear. Once, Meacham tried to initiate him into the orthodoxies of poker. And Smuddle taught him to drive. Each week he made the trip into town, with their list of miscellaneous items. And he would check the rack at Larcher's Necessaries! &amp; Quiddities! for the new All-Story. He couldn't get enough of John Carter's splendid deed-filled adventures on Mars. * It was published as "Under the Moons of Mars" in six installments, starting in February 1912 (retitled^4 Princess of Mars for the books, in 1917). He signed his opus "Normal Bean" - to tell the world, this flimsy escapism came from someone "normal in the head." (All-Story understandably read the written signature as "Norman Bean," and this became the byline.) Fifty-two years after, the series was still being gobbled by an avid worldwide readership (John Carter of Mars, the eleventh book, was pub- lished by Canaveral Press in 1964) and, through its imitators, had virtually defined a science-fantasy subgenre. An enlistee in the Seventh Cavalry, Burroughs had spent two bleak years in the Arizona Territory (1895-97: the formative Mars-espying years of the Lowell Observ- atory). Surely this accounts, in part, for the heartfelt (though repetitive) portrayal of the desert in his framing-story, that sets us up for John Carter's being spirited to Mars. "Few western wonders are more inspiring than the beauties of an Arizona moonlit landscape; the silvered mountains in the distance, the strange lights and shadows upon hog back and arroyo, and the grotesque details of the stiff, yet beautiful cacti form a picture at once enchanting and inspiring. . . ." But - Arizona; and then a protagonist mystically whisked to a Mars striated by engineered canals? It can't be Burroughs's early cavalry days are enough to account for his choice of these two emphatically-rendered locations. John Flint Roy: 'That Burroughs read and made use of Percival Lowell's books Mars and Its Canals and Mars as the Abode of Life cannot be denied." ". . . My attention was quickly riveted by a large red star close to the distant hori- zon. As I gazed upon it I felt a spell of overpowering fascination. It seemed to call me across the unthinkable void, to lure me to it, to draw me as the lodestone attracts a particle of iron. . . ." Green men. White apes. Red dunes. It begins. * And Arizona, to Louie? He had hours to fill as he pleased, too insignificant a worker to be timeclocked. Often, to or from his erranding at Larcher's, he would drive the Smuddlemobile along a desert maze spun out of his own spontaneous concocting. 34 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="30">Prodigious gunnysacks of color seemed to open on the mesa tops, and scrolls of it - salsa reds and vivid bunting blues and oolitic earthtones lifted straight from the fundament - unrolled down the seamed, deep-sienna sides. He watched a lady's beaded bag, a glinting polyp of jet and crimson, suddenly spring and land vigilant: a desert lizard. Some were ruffed, like Elizabethan courtiers. He'd see them mating. The male has two penises, both barbed. Their eyes are tight black berries, staring out of folds of ancient saurian granulation. A roadrunner sprinted across the track, a limp snake pinched in its beak. A jackrab- bit halted, as still as if it were painted on an old-time tavern sign. Its ears were huge highstanding floral-looking sculls - so thin that, backed as they were by the morning sun, my grandfather clearly saw their filamental networks of blood vessels, ruby on light buff (desert-functional: the air in breezing past them cools the blood). The creosote bush will grow continuously for 12,000 years - the oldest living organ- ism. It spreads out from its center, the stems on the inside dying, the stems on the outside ever-pioneering - this can eventually make a green ring up to twenty-five feet in diameter, on the sands. My grandfather stopped the car. There was nobody, only the buffs and the duns and the ambers, and that durable mother-of-all-blues in the sky. There was nobody, only my grandfather. He was the demiurge here, the djinn, he skipped to the center of the circle and whooped, he twirled in place, a feral, energy- spewing creature, spinning to keep the universe on its axis. Monstrous, wonder-ridden: it may as well have been Barsoom. "Good." One afternoon at Larcher's he counted out ten cents to an impassive-faced Native American customer shuffling there short by exactly a dime. The Indian's un- cracked stoniness was-dignity? anger? My grandfather couldn't tell. "Good" was his only response, then the purchase was made, and the man was gone in a stride. Another white might not have been the recipient even of that single word. But my grandfather gave out the wavelengths of a fellow alien wandering here amid the rows of garden hoses and after-dinner mints. A world was coming undone by 1912, you could have watched it happen from the vantage of the Larcher's cash register. Recipes for cholla buds, palo verde beans, ama- ranth greens, the pads of the prickly pear, incendiary mescal, were being replaced by canned and, later, refrigerated grocery goods. This supplantation will increase by the New Deal 1930s (the ethnobotany diet, gone to Cokes and burger patties) with dia- betes, hypertension, and chronic obesity its legacy. The principle is Newtonian in lucidity: two worlds cannot equally occupy one point. Of course my grandfather wouldn't have known this, any more than the Larcher's cashier or the Indian customer or the well-intended federal food-welfare corpsmen knew it. But he did know- after all, he was born in a culture where dybbuks scrammed from behind the grain trough when you lit a candle- he knew that when he drove through the desert at twilight, spirits skirled in the air, they left their kachinas like génies freed for the night from their lamps, they populated the gusts and the thermals and brushed his cheek indifferently, as if to say he wasn't of their tribe, their kind, but neither was he lost beyond the edge of their recognition. Albert Goldbarth 35</page><page sequence="31">Are these gods? or are these cycles of moisture-exchange in an arid system? He drove, he followed a line of radio- wail and blood-pull that preceded Ur of the Chal- dees on this Earth. It stripped his skin off like old wallpaper. It was magma and thump and theophany in his heart. And the moon, its bag of bonelight tangled over the mountains. * The Arizona moon floats over Krazy's Coconino with such frequency, it's almost a regular citizen of the cast - sometimes as thin as a sickle of cellophane; at others, as rounded and solid as a yellow carnival bump-'em car. The Navajo night chant, the "Yeibichai," goes: With beauty may I walk. With beauty before me, may I walk. With beauty behind me, may I walk. With beauty above me, may I walk. With beauty below me, may I walk. With beauty all around me, may I walk. And Officer Pup soliloquizes: Today my world walks in beauty. Beneath me a good earth - A gracious glebe, lies in beauty - Shifting sands dust its cheeks in powdered beauty - And now will I turn my eye to the empyrean - Where stars' gleam moon's beam So - I'll nap in beauty. Dat debbil moon. Oh lair of chaste splendor! Varnedoe and Gopnick suggest that "the squiggled needle and monoliths" and sim- ilar vertical structures in the oil paintings of Joan Mirô (in illustration of which they reproduce his 1926 painting Dog Barking at the Moon, with its ladder reaching from the ground-plane to the sky) have correspondence with "Herriman's great stone fin- gers" - those monumental, sometimes spire-like lithic formations of the Arizona des- erts, that he captured in his own mad manner. "Both devices suggest an enchanted universe where heaven and earth still adjoin, like tenement apartments connected by a fire escape." Herriman's father "operated a barbershop, owned a bakery, and dabbled in astron- omy." So it isn't surprising the son grows up to know how our lathers and doughs can rise alongside our sidereal aspirations. 36 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="32">One Sunday, Ignatz rigs a half-price (lensless) telescope for Krazy, and lifts a flim- flam crescent moon on a wire (it looks something like a croissant): "I see a moons, a marvillis moons," she oohs. But what Herriman also knows is how the "marvillis" is shaped by the "beholda's" eye. Another Sunday, Pupp says to Krazy, "Nice circle around (the) Til old moon tonight, eh, CK.'?" "Soikol?" she asks, and looks to see an impressive triangle framing the moon. "Yes - circle." "He mins a ctry-ankle'," Krazy explains to Ignatz. So now he looks . . . there's the moon, inside a luminous square. In one panel, it will be rubicond; the next, as green as sweet chilies. Here, as wheezed-out as a flat tire; there, as plump as a bratwurst bursting out of its own rich blotchy casing. Orchidaceously lush or as matter-of-fact as a subway token, it swoops the cockamamie Coconino overspaces in whatever guise is necessary, a small disquis- ition on relativism^ in lunar "lengwidge" as translated by George Herriman: it's a squib of toothpaste or paint from the tube, a penny squooshed on the railroad tracks, a protozoan paisley of Picasso-like conjecture far ahead of its time, a gorgeous thumb- printed pretzel-twist of a moon that could have been baked in a kiln, molybdenum, spongy, amuletic, pingpongesque, whatever. Say a man looks at the moon. A woman looks at the moon. That makes two moons. It was silver tonight, so painfully, sharply exquisite. . . . Keats needed to turn from the cottage's window. He was reminded of the cutting tools he'd seen them use when he was an apprentice in the surgery wards. He felt the moon could enter him that way tonight. "And I've already lost my heart," he said. He was waiting for her, she promised she'd manage to get away from her own enormous gauntlet of household duties by eight- it must be half-past now, at least. He shuffled a sheaf of pages from Endymion, impatiently. "O Moon! far-spooming Ocean bows to thee . . ." and shuffled again: . . . Despair! despair! He saw her body fading gaunt and spare In the cold moonshine. Straight he seiz'd her wrist; It melted from his grasp: her hand he kiss'd, And, horror! kiss'd his own - he was alone. -too true. It must be nearing on nine. And then he thought he heard- he did hear, footsteps, skipping up the rush-strewn gravel path! The heart he claimed he'd lost was doing wild calisthenics in his throat. There was a bashful knock, he hurried to the door and flung it open - "Amy&gt;" "Well, John," (puff) "who" {puff ) "were you expecting?" "Amy, please: you know those vile things exacerbate my coughing." Albert Goldbarth 37</page><page sequence="33">* She woke and found herself chuckling, and had the wisdom to carry her dream- chuckle into a hearty, wakeful laugh. Keats, still! - canoodling about in her brain- muck all these years! When she returned to Boston she'd be sure to tell Ada of this, and then they'd both chuckle, lightly holding one another in the ring of sixteen pillows. Ah, but Ada was many hundreds of miles away now, and the maid, and the maroon platoon of drivers. This trip, her first this way, was solo. Somehow it needed to be. She closed her eyes, she imagined the ties of the railroad tracks at such speed, that they blended into a single length of excellent parquet- work, the kind in her second- floor study. She shifted her aching kielbasa body in its seat. A first-class seat! - it could have been a crate for oranges! And some of these other "first-class" passengers! - there was a woman, foreign, smelled it, talked it (guttural rollings), dressed it with her three rough- woven scarves worn simultaneously, an anarchist. In the darkness, in the alone- ness, Amy was sure of it. An anarchist, with an oilcloth bag that might have held bombs. She gave off a mixture of cheap cologne and garlic. When the porter announced that Providence, the marvels of twentieth-century technology, and seven optional small-town stops that the newlywed engineer had simply ignored in his passion to turn back East, meant they would arrive three hours ahead of schedule, Amy gleamed with relief. She stared out the window and watched the moon make sterling silver service of the trees. Next stop, Arizona. * "Louis? I merely request an explanation." Some nights, with a bottle of sugary wine from Larcher's never-failing provender in his pocket, and soon in his blood, my grandfather found himself leaning fraternally (if cautiously) against a great saguaro in the nearby desert, telling it his problems, or singing softly to it, or simply trying to hear the slow green thrum of its own deep- pithed interior life. And this saguaro was as familiar to him as, say, a Hassidic Jew - that is, extreme; but knowable. Here, though, with the eyes of the pantheon Tolliver, Slipher, Slipher, Lampland and Lowell upon him, Louie knew he faced an alien consciousness. "Vahsheenktun, Jafferson, Vahsheenktun," he incanted under his breath. It was all that could come to him in his time of need, an American lucky mantra. Then Tolliver caught his eye. He'd spoken a few times to Tolliver. If he tried, now, to remind this man of their earliest camaraderie. . . ? "Misters. A voman, she meets the bear in the voods. The bear says. . . ." "Louie: no. Sir," he turned to Lowell, "I've conversed with the man, a little. I believe. . . . Sir?" Lowell was holding All-Story, flipping through its pulp pages. Semi- naked Martian paramours, Martian swordsmen. . . . He threw it out the door, into 38 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="34">the antechamber, an energetic overhand pitch; for added effect, he walked to the door and carefully, coolly closed it. "Fm sorry, Mr. Tolliver. You were saying?" "That I believe this man, who has demonstrated intuitive abilities with mechanical problems, may have . . . may have knowingly. . . . What I mean is, he may have helped us " "There is no denying, Mr. Tolliver, that this Louis has helped us." They continued to talk as if he were rooms away. "I should like to determine how accidently, or how intentionally. And I should like to establish, for this Louis's sake and our own peace of mind, some sets of clearer guidelines for access by the unauthorized to the observatory." This went on for quite some while. At one point Lowell said to Louie, as if not sure if he were confronting an idiot savante or a captured circus ape, "The stars, Louis." Indicating up with his forefinger. "What do you know about the stars?" "Veil, vhen they fall- this means God is closer to the vorld. Then God is lissning to us." Lowell stared. The staff had never seen Old Ironballs stare this way. He still couldn't tell if he was dealing with pawky ingenuity or idiocy. But the story of how my grandfather halted the great man in his inquisition, has come down to the family, mixed, eventually, with a version of Einstein's saying he couldn't believe that God played dice with the universe. "See?" someone would say, Aunt Tillie or maybe one of the Pinkuses. "See? mitt the stars, mitt Gott. He knew, I tell you, chust like Einstein, a cheenyus?' Here, I need to remember that Lowell reads popular detective stories; TheMaulev- ener Murders, for instance, is on his shelves. He has his circumlocutious wit. He isn't the worst stuffed shirt the Boston gentry has produced. But these are tender times. The surer he is of his melt-conducting canals, the more his theories are mocked. And now, this- this bumwipe of a magazine! And this sawily nitwit floorsweeper! He's exasperated, tired suddenly down to his body's bottommost cobblestone byways. All he can do is stare, and that's how Meacham finds them when he coughs by way of self-announcement and peeks in from the antechamber. "Sir? Mr. Lowell?"- he's whispering. Tolliver answers on behalf of his chief. "What, Meacham?" An orotund stage whisper now: 'Them newspaper fellas are-" Here. With their being a little early, and Louie's draconian questioning running so long The minions of Mars Hill all are staring as wide-eyed as Lowell now. A beaming, beefy man in a species of derby gives a shake and push to Meacham's hand, as if it were a latch, and Meacham a door; and Meacham, in fact, can't help but act the part, he seems to swivel open. A knot of four of Hearst's reporters enters the room. Albert Goldbarth 39</page><page sequence="35">"Mr. Lowell! Sorry to barge in early but, well, what good are canals without barges?" Derby barks appreciatively at his own joke. Lowell pales. The other three mean nothing to him, but Derby - ! Derby is Garrett P. Serviss, skeptic, and captain of science-column writers for the Hearst chain. It takes only a second for Lowell to see this, to understand the importance of creating a pristinely strong impression, and to realize that the ridiculous situation with this shabby janitorial type now center- stage requires expeditious, subtle maneuvering. In this same second, Lowell's élan returns. He'll merely dismiss the intrusive Louis for now, and swiftly move to rounds of champagne while Tolliver ably manages to re-shim The Master Unit with something more seemly, perhaps a lacquered cedar- wood plaque from the study, perhaps. . . . But this is a busy second. One of the other reporters, a rumpled sort in a lumpish Stetson hat, has set his bristol board down on the floor, and is dashing excitedly, arms open, to the center of the room, as if greeting a relative at a railway station, but that can't be. "Lou-boy!" And he's hugging the under-custodian. "Lou-boy, you tickle my buz- zum!" He claps him roughly on the shoulders. "My bosom is also funny from you, mine friend." "And a lady," Serviss says, with a courtly doffing of his derby, "who accompanied us from town in our taxi." "Louie!" "Rosie!" And she drops her bulging oilcloth bag with a thump. The Master Unity gentlemen, serves not only Mars Hill but the scientific community on an international scale, as you can see by a small demonstration my staff and I have dribbles away like so much runny tapioca pudding, good-bye, it was nice while it lasted, fare- well to thee, oh golden one. Now everybody's staring - Lowell, the Lowell subalterns, Hearst's quartet - at Louie, who has some explaining to do. He points to Rosie. "Mine luff," he explains. Herriman grins like a proud proud papa. "Percival, doesn't this call for champagne?" * "Hell (pardon me, ma'am) but any friend of George's" and Garrett P. Serviss ges- tures expansively toward the Stetson-hatted grinner, "is a friend of mine and a friend of William Randolph Hearst himself, I'll wager, and so is his friend's true lady-love!" And so Percival Lowell finds himself ringing for Meacham and, by God, five min- utes later champagne indeed is flowing copiously, and toasts go around to the reu- nited couple, who stand there dazed and fitfully whispering phlegmy, gravelly foreign sentiments to each other. Anyway, Louie is dazed. He and Lowell have this, at least, in common. Their stares around the room-at-large resemble the look of mounted deer heads. If anybody here 4O NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="36">is assured and at ease, it's the foreignest one in the room. But Rosie is happily doing exactly what she'd come to do - reclaiming her man - and doing it quicker, it seems, and in loftier style than ever she'd imagined when the wives of Louie's friends chipped in for her own "first-cless" train ticket to Flagstaff. New in the state by an hour and in the sanctum sanctorum observatory by only five minutes, she stands near Louie nodding at the rounds of lifted glasses with regal comportment, as if she were used to the gathered masses bestowing her compliments. The Master Unit backdrops her as if it were constructed with this single purpose in mind: to be the intricate, yea, museum-quality frame around Rosie-from-Cowflop-Poland, Rosie-Come-to-Amer- ica, for whom the stars and the planets have now been made to stop in their tracks. My grandmother Rosie, the Queen of the Universe. And all this while, Lowell - with looks of vague imploration to Tolliver - is hoping their social boil will simmer down, after all it's still possible, and some soupçon of factual Martian newsworthiness be broached. By "all this while" I mean - what? thirty minutes? Enough for the other taxi to finally wind its way to Mars Hill. And it would have been sooner, but first her thirteen suitcases needed gathering up- more than the luggage department at the Flagstaff depot has handled so far all month. She sees the front door is ajar; Meacham is nowhere about. She spends ten minutes browsing a magazine she finds, All-Story; and then, not really caring who she inter- rupts or why, she opens the observatory door, she peers commandingly over the screwy cocktail scene with consummate Amy Lowell hauteur. They turn to face a heap of ghee grandstyled in formal diamonded black. "No wonder you see those lines all over Mars, Percy. Offer me a drink and I'll see them with you." She gives them a smile that's won (or at least intimidated) the hearts of kings and philosophers. And Lowell, stunned by her sudden appearance (he'd planned on having Smuddle meet her train at three pm) but also delighted- his sister, his little sister! someone who will understand!- Lowell seamlessly meets the occasion. "Gentlemen: Miss! Amy! Lowell!" and this is what does it: "the Poet." She radiates. Then he politely corrects himself. "Gentlemen and lady," nodding toward Rosie. Who Amy notices now. "Percy! That woman, her bag-! She has bombs!" It happened this way. It happened in the Barsoomian dimension. I call it "the Sy- zygy of 1912." 5. That year, the Arizona Territory becomes the state of Arizona. Chagall completes The Cattle Dealer. The S. S. Titanic sinks: 1,513 drown. The process for manufactur- ing cellophane is invented by Edwin Brandenberger. Victor F. Hess discovers cosmic radiation. The shaped remains of that charlatan ancestor, Piltdown Man, are found near Lewes (and won't be proved a hoax for forty-one years more). Ravel's ballet of "Daphnis and Chloe" opens in Paris. Carl Jung's The Theory of Psychoanalysis appears, as does the new word "vitamin" (coined by Polish chemist Kasimir Funk). Albert Goldbarth 41</page><page sequence="37">And Picasso is dabbing away at The Scallop Shelly his oil-and-cnamcl-on-canvas that uses (and so coopts?) a faithful image of the cover of Notre Avenir est dans Vair, a 1912 brochure exhorting France to develop aeronautics for military power. Contrapuntal, squinting-artist-yin and goggled-fighter-pilot-yang, these two zoom into the binary future, here a world, there a world, everywhere a whirled world It might be as unthinkably large as global war. ... It might be Wilson's cloud-chamber photographs done in 1912 that lead, at last, to the detection of electrons and protons. . . . "Kiss my ass," says Larcher to the shipment driver unloading his cases of syrup. This Coca-Cola drink is five cents a glass, as much as a three-egg breakfast with grits, but the thirsty minions of Flagstaff, Arizona, can't get enough of it! And here's this dinkass delivery man who thinks he can drop off half a shipment, and credit the store toward shipment-and-a-half »#tf month! Suuure. What a world! * . . . That's all so far, or seemingly far, away. The brouhaha's ha'd-out. Elliptic explanations have been offered and accepted; and we find them now, ten men, two women, tentatively stitched together around a com- mon appreciation of Percival Lowell's champagne and Rosie Kaplan's loaves of braided egg-glaze cballab, that an hour ago were unwrapped from their waxy swaddle in proof that they were balms of a sort, not bombs. They go especially well with the jars of pickled herring she's brought, and the capers and chutney Lowell directs be excavated from miscellania-level in the pantry. "EX-cellent bakery goods!" says Slipher the elder a third time, diving into the rick of herrings on his plate, then sandwiching one in a folded challah slice. "Still fresh, despite the train ride! You know, Miss Kaplan," and here he brandishes his fork in the air like Liberty her torch, "our friends at Larcher's in the city - Louis, do you know Larcher's? - stock a bread inferior to this as, say, the catfish is to the salmon. If you were to share the secrets behind this, with our friends there - for remuneration, of course - I believe the entire Flagstaff community would be in your debt." A general huzzah of assent from everybody breaks forth, although Louie is half- devoted to studying Rosie's ankles where they're delicately paired beneath her hem; and Lowell is busy with two thin metal rods he's slid from the core of The Master Unit, with which he's demonstrating the employment of chopsticks to Garrett P. Serviss; and Herriman is in heaven, hat tilted back on his head, feet propped up on a pseudo-hassock improvised from Rosie's sturdy hat box, sketching, sketching! "Let's see . . .," Tolliver tries. "Auntie Rosie's Baked Goods?' Then he looks at Amy and slips her a wink. "An explosion of taste in each biter * It's evening. He won't take "no" for an answer. His distinguished guests from the Hearst empire will stay the night in the Mars Hill baronial guest quarters. Just now, Lampland is beginning the demonstration of The Master Unit - deftly and persua- 42 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="38">sively, it should be said - having risen in rank to Explainer Supreme, so the sibling reunion can deepen (from its flurried, dramatic afternoon start) in Lowell's study. Suddenly this is vastly more important to him than wooing the flunkies of Hearst or anyone else. "Oh, Amy, what a vexatious day!" "These are vexatious times." She's sitting, a living rotunda, on the dragonfoot ma- hogany sofa (upholstered in red, with fine black striping, it could almost be a design his dearly-defended canals have inspired). "Parlous, parlous times," she addends. They each have one of his Cuban cheroots in hand, and they each gaze into its rising writhe of smoke as if an oracle might spell the terms of the future there. "And this helldzmn Democrat Wilson who's in office now - ! Amy, back East. . . ." ". . . are troubles, Percy. The mills are fomenting. The center of our lives, I'm afraid, is coming undone. I'm so scared sometimes, Percy. Not even Ada can coddle me out of it. And my book . . ." her defenses are down in this room, she doesn't need to be The Brass Valkyrie here ". . . what they've done to my book. . . ." She turns her head, so he won't have to be ashamed for her visible weakness. "Amyl" his lips purse out a raspberry of derision, "Hang the reviewers! Hang the public, too! Hang cem or buy cem off, but don't let dundernoggins stop you. Look, those men out there, from the newspaper-?" and his eyes switch from a lovely bronze-and-polished-rosewood orrery on his desk, to the study door. Does he hear a cabal, even now, tiptoeing up to the other side? "For eighteen years, off and on, again and again, this is what they've tried doing to me." He snaps his cheroot in half. "Don't go and operatically pluck your nerves on my account, Percy. I'm sorry. You're tired, I can see it, don't fib. Your eyes are red." "Yes. But it isn't anger or weariness, little Postscript. It's Mars. I swear the color's rubbed off on me, and in me, I probably /&gt;iff red. Amy, I look, and I look, I know that planet better than most men know the skin of their wives, and no one believes me. Well, some do. My men here, Flammarion over in France, but ... Amy, it isn't even my sight that goes up the telescope by now, but a connective tissue." "Look. . . ." he lifts a paperweight (it's Mars, the size of a softball) and flashes a handfull of graphs in front of her. "Just from last month. Sightings of double canals, with atmospheric condition at the times of sighting noted. If you knew the moon this well. ..." "Now, Percy; there are moons, and there are moons, I think my darling moon" and here she rummages in her purse, then fishes out the much-crumbled All-Story (he's astonished, of course: is he cursed? won't this thing ever disappear?) "must be more like this Mars than yours." She sees his face. "Don't be disappointed in me. But I don't want to measure my moon with a calipers, Percy. My moon was teeming with gnome folk and goddesses long before this urchin magazine was ever birthed into the world." And she holds her hand out to him. He can almost look at the magazine tenderly now, as a unit of what she is, and of the tenderness he necessarily feels for her. This conversation needs turning around. "Do you remember," she asks, and spreads her arms with thespian overvigor, "the time in the middle of dinner when you and Lawrence started acting out the Lizzie Borden murder trial?" Albert Goldbarth 43</page><page sequence="39">"Yes! Yes! and three guests left the room! Remember? - Lawrence proved the axe committed the murders all alone, then went and buried itself in the garden. And you said - " "Yes, I said 'Lawrence, stop, the guests are becoming exAXEperated!'" Giggling. Back there in time. "And I remember the fables your Japanese friend, Tsunejiro, used to tell me. Once . . ." They'll do this till the sun comes up. Let's leave the room. Let's linger while one tentative knock at the door interrupts their memoryfest, and then let's leave, let's have them continue this energizing bout of mutual solace in the dignity of private salvation. "Yes? Lampland? "Yes sir." "Come in. Well! And how did The Master Unit function?" "Flawlessly, sir - once Tolliver repositioned your pair of chopsticks in the core, and we had the loan of Miss Lowell's tortoise-shell cigar case for a shim." "Good. Thank you. Tell your guests to sleep well tonight. Tell them it's the closest they'll ever come to sleeping on Mars herself." * The Martian day is 24 hours 37 minutes 22 seconds. The Martian day, or padan, is ten zodes (67 padans making a month, or teean; 10 teeans^ an ord). The Polar caps of Mars were first discovered by Giovanni Cassini (who later be- came a French subject and changed his name to Jean Dominique Cassini). The north polar region is home to both the yellow-skinned people of Okar and the red-skinned people of Pankar; in the south polar region, the black-skinned First Born live in the Valley Dor, and the white-skinned Priests of Issus dwell in the fierce Otz Mountains. The Viking 1 and 2 explorations of Mars have failed to prove the existence of any life on Mars, not even down to the microbial level. Mars is Nergal, abode of Nergal, Babylonian god of death and pestilence. Mars is Pahlavani Sipher. Mars is Harmakhis. Mars is Tui (the source of the English 'Tues- day"; remember the Rolling Stones song "Ruby Tuesday"?). Mars is master of the daylight hours of Tuesday. Its metal is iron, its gem is he- matite. It rules the liver, the kidney, and the left ear. Mars invaded Earth on the night before Halloween in 1938, as reported over the radio on Mercury Theater (thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of people panic, fleeing on the highways, besieging their local police and churches, falling in fields sobbing). Mars is just a touch over the size of Earth (its diameter is approximately 4,200 miles) and Mars is Kepler's key to unlocking the system of planetary orbits and Mars is awash in the blood of the warring green tribes and Mars is close and then Mars is farther away then Mars is close again, with its umlaut of moons, with its emptiness and bounty. 44 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="40">Oh but Mars is capacious, it will hold all this and, verily, more. Like Earth, it will bear its superfluity selves with the unknowing ease of a pinhead bearing those an- gels - powers, thrones, and dominions of angels - that the scriptures tally in mystic numbers beyond the counting of humankind. * It don't know what he's like at home, with Mabel. I can only report to you that here, in his baronial guest bed, George Herriman still wears his veteran Stetson. Maybe he thinks he needs the hat to draw. He's drawing, in any case. He's leaned back on his pillow, his legs are up to act as a drawing-board, he's humming a sloshy version of "Kissy Kissy Girl" around his thumb-width cigarette. First, he sketches a few attempts at The Master Unit. Above them goes a dark bowl studded with clustered stars like generals' medals and gumball planets and cymbal moons. In a while, the Kat appears - she's never off his mind, these days - and gam- bols under this band of astronomical grandiosity. The Mouse appears, a wicked, sul- furous fuming in his breast; he hurls the brick ... it boinks the Kat's skull ... so she "sees stars," and they flitter away to join their celestial brethren and sistren. . . . Now it's a starry canopy, over a wedding. Herriman gives a growly laugh. You see, he knows- though Lou-boy doesn't yet, no Lou-boy is lost in a jambalaya of love and fear and indecision and devilish imps in his scrotum - Herriman knows, he can see it as plain as his own stained fingers, there's a wedding in the future, he can read the set of Rosie's jaw. She's going to clamp on that boy like a beartrap. She's going to butter him front and back and add a sprig of parsley. And, before he does let sleep spill its ink through his brain, he tries a portrait of Percival Lowell, an homage to Lowell, there's no line of demarcation where the eye stops and the telescope begins. Perhaps they had an itch in common, and Herriman sensed this; his biographers say "Obsession is a major theme of Herriman's work." And just before he sets down the pencil, he places Officer Pupp in the scene. Now Lowell spots the star on that uniformed chest, and the telescope follows it. ... Who is this man- this serious, sane, astringently intelligent man- who will spend the final twenty-two years of his life insisting he's witnessed a planned-out seine of lines where NASA Mars-probe scientists say they have the on-site photographic proof that none exists? The question deliquesces away at the edges of thought, leaving only a residue that frustrates us. We may as well ask: Who are these NASA scientists to say they have the proof no lines exist, where this serious, sane, intelligent man has seen them repeatedly, reading the open russet palm of Mars with probity for the final twenty-two years of his life? "The point at issue is not whether the things reported were actually happening, but whether they were believed to be happening, and on this point there is not a scintilla of doubt." Albert: Goldbarth 45</page><page sequence="41">That's Edward Harrison, in his fine book Masks of the Universe. He says, "The theme of this book is that the universe in which we live, or think we live, is mostly a world of our own making. The underlying idea rests on the distinction between Uni- verse and universes. "The Universe is everything. What it is in its own right, independent of our chang- ing opinions, we never know. "The universes are our models of the Universe. They are great schemes of intricate thought - grand cosmic pictures - that rationalize human experience. A universe is a mask fitted on the face of the unknown Universe. Each universe determines what is per- ceived and what constitutes valid knowledge." Fd like to think an accurate emblem of this would be his telescope, an unbent reed angled up at the sky, as the turbulent murmuring currents and mists of the Hopi/ Navajo spirit worlds swirl forcefully about it. Or couldn't it simply be any two people alone together? "Alone" "together." On the oak bench at the milking shed. "Louie, you made me the promise. You write some letters, very good; but you made me the promise. Love, Louie the letters say. "Nui" * "The night," says Mrs. Kwakk Kwakk, she of duckly mien, "it teems with moon - and promise." (George Herriman, KrazyKat.) The sky is one of Arizona's most opulent effects in a while: velvety indigo, lit with long ribbons of milky incandescence. And speaking of milk: on the other side of the wall, the soft damp huffing of Venus, in some troubled sleep, keeps time. The bell that Satellite wears around her scrawny neck is a fitful counterpoint. Louie clears his throat. Excited. Uncomfortable. I'd like to think Rosie is somewhat stern. She's risked humiliation in coming to see him so susceptibly, she's risked the thousand-and-one gentile confusions and degra- dations in wait around every corner outside of the Lower East Side; she's worn her three good scarves, at once, in staggered layers; she's shared her bread with meshûg- ganeh strangers. All in all, she's earned his deference now. I'd like to think he offers it. I'd like to believe his time spent on whatever psychic mission the desert represents, was healing time: that the wine and the car and the planet maps and the cacti mean he can step back into his own self now, on Forman Street, with dignity, and direction. "The cow . . . she was for me to milk, like in Poland." "Now is not Poland, Louie, now is not FlekstefF, now is New York I think, yah?" "Yah. Rosie . . . you smell maybe chicken feathers?" Fd like to think they kiss. Fd like, what the hell, to think they kiss and the whole grand ganglionic burning show-of-shows up there turns fireworks over their kiss, and Fd like to believe their kiss is a contract. Yes, and before we turn our faces circum- spectly from this tryst, Fd like to think his tongue is hungrily tracing the question marks that are molded, even before birth, into the human ear. 46 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="42">But what do I know? - this part of the story is buried (since ifs never come up) more surely than Assyria or Babylon. I only know that later Smuddle will show Rosie back to the main house: this is 1912, and certain sticky proprieties must be kept. She will sleep, she will wake, there will be a moment of wedding canopy and then many years of depleting labor, these years will pass, she will love, she will ache, she will croon, she will carry my mother. * Percival Lowell will live for four years more. Every night he will break himself like a wave on the sands of that red red planet. Every day he will buzz the buzz of the gadfly in the waking world's complacency. In November 1916 he will die at the ob- servatory. His body will be buried on Mars Hill in a mausoleum that looks like a small observatory, with a dome of translucent blue glass. His spirit - call it what you want - will ascend, along a line of obsession, to the planet Mars. The natives there will dredge him from one of the Low Canals, and expirate its waters from his lungs. He will marvel: the intricate system of locks (for some are navigable), and the lightsome boat- ing parties! When Amy learns of his stroke and death, the funeral will be over by a week. She's suffered a month of neuralgia, gastritis, and jaundice - with double the normal dose of morphine fuddling the pain in her body - and the house will keep this news from her, until her partial recovery. So much is still ahead! The Imagism wars, and the Spectra hoax, and the ouija seance, and her book of Chinese translations, the dinners, the rollercoaster reviews of her work, the bold forays and anonymous snipings, every final ovation and snigger, all three operations on her sturdy, hurting, oildrum of a body, every last wrung-out line of a poem. ... On May 12, 1925 she will look in the mirror and see the right side of her face drop. To Ada she'll simply say, "A stroke." They will gather wagons of lilacs from Sevenels' garden, surround her corpse with these, and then - at her request - she will be cremated, and the ashes consigned to the family plot at Mount Auburn. Her spirit will tunnel loose, her real self, a wee trans- parent flimmer (I said "tank-like" once, but I was wrong). She's free, at last! And she will hover, a hummingbird, over that posthumous Pulitzer Prize, and like a hum- mingbird she will dart about it, supping from its sweetness. Singing the poet's song: too late, too late. John Keats will consign his memory to the erasure of running water. Edgar Rice Burroughs will publish twenty-eight Tarzan novels and forty-four other books. At Pasadena-time 4:53 am, July 20th, 1976, a thirteen-hundred-pound vehicle just about the size of a jeep will land on Mars on the western slopes of Chryse Planitia, 22.3 degrees north latitude and 47.5 degrees west longitude. The sky will be salmon-pink; the soil, uniformly red. The summary Norman H. Horowitz (emeritus professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology) will provide, begins, "Viking found no life on Mars." Louie and Rosie will live in Chicago. (The New York business will finally fail, after some exhilarating false starts; and distant relatives invite them to that booming lake- shore city). They will raise (in order) Sally, Regina, Fannie. They will yell out their Albert Goldbartb 47</page><page sequence="43">wares. She will chip Lake Michigan whitefish out of blocks of ice; and he will don his burgundy-and-epauletted organ-grinder-monkey's outfit, lifting the shoppers to toys and fixtures and ladies' lingerie. At night the el will rattle their bones like dice in a godly game of chance. They will dance at the balln. They will do the two-backed hoochiekoo in bed. She will save the crusts of the bread, he will pick in the alley for rusted scrap and string. The girls will blossom, in their stringbean way (Regina, lost to brain cancer, eating, eating at her, like silverfish in her skull). More weddings. Grandchildren. Time will never press the stop switch on its turbines. He will grow hair in his ears ("gray moss!" I yelled, it became a family "cute" joke). She will pluck the bowel from the rend in the chicken one morning and see her hand is shaking. They will sit together on the porch and watch the moon, that great bronze seal of approval on the night. She will teach me to sing "In Jersey City vhere I did dvell," she will buy me a bottle of orange pop and hug me into the florid peeked-at creases of her décolletage - it's heavily shpritzed with dimestore perfume. She will enter her room in the hospital with a cheery wave and leave it without her uterus. She will wail at this all night until the sky tears down the middle like black silk, "Aiy, I'm not no vooman no more." He will shrivel. She will die. He will live for a visit a week in the place they call The Home. . . . But all that's the future. Life is never the past, the present, or the future. Life is moments the size of the Thailand bumblebee bat that weighs less than a penny. They're at the station now, a week later. Hearst's reporters have gone six days before (with Serviss showily unconvinced ofcanali, but bearing a furtive respect for his host's well-marshaled zeal). Herriman said, "Lou-boy, you're a genuine ringtailed prodigy," and hugged him and ostentatiously smooched on Rosie. "Here," he gave Louie a piece of paper, folded and taped, "to open later. And here," a separate piece, "my newspaper telephone number. I know a place that seasons its egg foo yung with lightning." But of course they never did get together, back in New York. Then Louie had spent six days at his round of menial tasks while Smuddle searched out a replacement. Lowell took Amy and Rosie picnicking into the desert. Rosie attempted a cigarillo. Amy learned the words to Bah mir hist du shayn. Louie had given Lowell a present, a child's toy he'd purchased at Larcher's, that Lowell removed from his briefcase now: a pair of cheap rose-tinted spectacles. Looking around: the sands were red. This is what it would be like. When the train pulled into the station, there was an all-around formal shaking of hands. Then Louie pinched Rosie's bottom, for show. "Jews," thought Lowell. "You have the monies?" asked Amy. Rosie nodded. (For the recipe, from Mrs. Larcher's private coffers, and gratefully paid out.) "Mine friends," said Louie, clearing his throat and feeling important, "about the goodbye. Ve haff a saying from mine people - " but the train whistle lowed, and they ran off in a rhythm of his duffle bag and her hat box. That night, while Rosie dozed, he untaped George's drawing. He was standing under a canopy, holding Rosie's hand, and the sky was crammed with six-pointed Jewish stars. In the corner, that Coconino feline gave a frolicsome leap and clicked her heels. "Be heppa," she said. 48 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="44">* He will kronikle the kanon of the Kat every day until April 25, 1944. Dropsy, mi- graine, arthritis.
