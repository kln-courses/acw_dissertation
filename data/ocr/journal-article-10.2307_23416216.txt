<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Lavery Aesop After Darwin: The RadicalAnthropomorphism of The Far Side Gary Larson is retired. His once daily, one-frame comic strip The Far Side, now available in an incredibly handsome, two volume Com plete Far Side, has nonetheless left its mark on American popular cul ture. In its day The Far Side had a devout following and, thanks to its frequent display on the office doors of both scientists and humanists, as well as the calendars, greeting cards, and coffee mugs spontaneously gen erated in its wake, Larson's cartoons have indeed become a prominent part of our cultural landscape. Indeed, for many of us Larson's imagina tion has forever shaped our perception of things: I, for one, will attest that The Far Side has fine-tuned my own sixth sense of humor. Though decidedly modern, at the heart of much of Larson's bizarre humor lies an impulse as old as Aesop, to which the former biology major Larson gives a post-Darwinian twist. Co-denizens there with odd look ing, virtually interchangeable, oafish humans, and the hordes of allusions and long-enduring cliches from literature, media, popular science, and folklore which constitute the air they all breathe, animals are citizens of central importance in The Far Side's idiosyncratic humorverse. Larson uses them not as patently anthropomorphic vehicles for preaching ethical truisms and teaching morals, but to create an epistemological mirror in 28.1 October 2005</page><page sequence="2">72 Lavery which we once witnessed, while we ate our breakfast, our own suppos edly scientific knowledge, our own fears, stupidity, and lack of instinctual knowledge, our self-consciousness, shared by the creature world, with debilitating side-effects, in what might be called "radical anthropomor phism." From microscopic organisms to the higher primates, Far Side ani mals exhibit human characteristics. As in the traditional animal fable, from Aesop to Fontaine. Kenneth Grahame to Pogo, they talk, wear clothing, live in human dwellings, and exhibit human motives and human foibles. But the final effect is not, as in the didacticism of Aesop, the sentimentahsm of Disney, or the very commercial anthropomorphism of a Snoopy or a Garfield, to deny the creature world its own reality. In The Dictionary of the History of Ideas, Joseph Agassi defines anthropomorphism simply as "an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena—consciously or not" (87). Clearly, Larson's anthropomorphism is hardly "inveterate." With ethologically grounded, post-Darwinian awareness, Far Side animal cartoons instead parody our tendency to see the human in everything, reminding us at the same time of the separate, secret reality of nature: looking closely at ani mals, they make fun of us. We live in an age dedicated to the eradication of anthropomorphic thinking. From Descartes' conception of the "beast-machine" in the Sev enteenth Century, to the insistence of his followers that shrieks of pain from vivisected animals were merely mechanical—like an alarm going off on a clock, to Thomas Nagel's classic essay "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" (we can never know, the author insists), to current defenses of animal experimentation, the modern mind has, for both philosophical and practical reasons, taken precautions to guard against anthropomorphism. From the ancient belief that man is a microcosm of the natural and cosmic world, a world view which made possible and convincing the perception of human qualities in animal, vegetable, and mineral without resorting to movie-era metaphors of projection, we have come instead to assume not Studies in Popular Culture</page><page sequence="3">The Radical Anthropomorphism of The Far Side 73 only that the macrocosm does not exhibit the human but that man may not either. As Agassi puts it, summarizing our contemporary understanding, "It is not what we know of human beings, but what we assume to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls" (87). The crusade against anthropomorphism has, of course, been led by modern science's "eradication of mystery" (the term is B.F. Skinner's, his concise definition of science), but even a humanist like the Victorian John Ruskin went out of his way to denounce the "pathetic fallacy"—the literary attri bution of human feelings to the natural world. Today, we can even find stand-up comedians exposing anthropo morphism. In a routine called "Animals All," Robert Klein provides comic insight into our excessive humanizing of animals. Our whole view of animals [Klein explains] is entirely human. We see them in our own image. I don't want to shock any one here but there are chimpanzees in Africa that do not smoke cigars and roller skate. They're not named "Jimmy" and "JoJo" and "Simba." They don't ordinarily wear tuxedos and funny hats. Everything is anthropomorphic. We see everything through human terms. On a cockroach spray can it says "Spray underneath the sink. They like moisture." As if they could like and dislike: "They dislike wide open and well-lit places. They're bored by televi sion. They love weddings." First of all, if you spray underneath the sink, they don't go underneath the sink. They're up in the cabinet attacking the Lorna Doones. Later in the same routine, Klein satirizes the anthropomorphism of house breaking, noting that when a puppy defecates indoors, we rub its nose in its excrement, as if the dog, like a human being, would find such a punish ment disgusting and change its ways, forgetting of course that every dog knows "how to sniff [excrement] in the womb. He does it as part of his signal system. He doesn't do it for perverse human reasons." Now de-anthropomorphism is sometimes a prominent theme in The Far Side. In two companion cartoons, for example, Larson pokes fun at our naive assumptions about communication with animals in a manner 28.1 October 2005</page><page sequence="4">74 Lavery similar to Klein. Under the title "What we say to dogs," a man lectures his dog: "Okay, Ginger! I've had it! You stay out of the garbage! Under stand, Ginger? Stay out of the garbage, or else!" In a second frame, under the title "What they hear," the words coming out of the master's mouth have been reduced to "blah blah GINGER blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah GINGER blah blah blah blah blah" (1: 338). While the man naively assumes his pet understands his lecture, the dog in reality hears only his own name. In a later cartoon, "What we say to cats, "Larson extends this de-anthropomorphism to cats: this time, however, the bal loon in the second panel is completely empty; cats hear nothing we say (1: 349). More often than not, however, The Far Side remains anthropomor phic—at least on the surface; personification, in fact, would seem to be The Far Side's dominant trope. But there is a method to its madness. Its anthropomorphism is "radical" in the literal meaning of the word: it seeks to get to the root of anthropomorphism. Not afraid of compounding mys tery rather than eradicating it, Gary Larson uses anthropomorphism to study anthropomorphism. As both human ecologist Paul Shepard and the French anthropologist Levi-Strauss have reminded us, animals have al ways been for the human mind "things with which to think," and in The Far Side they continue to be so—even on the funny pages. According to David Guss's delightful and illuminating anthology The Language of the Birds: Tales, Texts, and Poems of Interspecies Com munication, a large number of world cultures over the centuries have actually harbored some version of the belief that animals have a secret life outside of mankind's presence. Animals behave like animals, according to this belief, only to appease us: It was, and still is in many places, a widely held belief that the part of the animal we see is not the real part but only a disguise, an outfit it wears when it comes to visit our world. Once home again, it removes that costume and changes back into its true form—a form which in most cases is said to be no different than that of the humans. In fact, the animal and even the plant and mineral species are said to live just as we do. They have their own homes Studies in Popular Culture</page><page sequence="5">The Radical Anthropomorphism of The Far Side 75 and families and only put on their various disguises when they wish to trade or communicate with people of other tribes, (ix) Animated cartoons, of course, have helped keep this belief alive for mod ern Americans who, at least on Saturday morning, are quite willing to believe that Tweetie Bird, Sylvester, Bugs, Tom, Jerry, and their like do indeed act differently when they have the house to themselves. In the self contained world of The Far Side, such a belief is a given, a tenet of its faith. Again and again we bear witness to, through the window of The Far Side, the secret life of animals, a life that often bears an uncanny resem blance to our own. A group of cows standing in a field beside a road conversing happily until a cow-sentinel spots an oncoming car. In the sec ond panel, the cows revert to normal behavior, grazing stupidly. Once the car has passed, however, they return to form, the sentinel again alert for any sign of the human (1:360). It is true, of course, that The Far Side's famous cows are not al ways so secretive; sometimes they even make fun of us (1: 587), as if getting revenge for all those times that a passing car's passengers—usu ally children—"mooed" derisively at them when they were behind the fence. But for the most part the secret life of animals remains secret and seemingly anthropomorphic. A dog couple departs from an evening with friends, and the henpecking wife expresses her disgust with her husband's bad mannered reversion to pre-domesticated canine behavior: "One of the nicest evenings we've ever spent with the Wilson's... and then you had to go and do that on the rug" (1: 78). Dogs that own their homes obviously need to be housebroken. Sometimes, even in their homes, Farsidians bring with them the lifestyle they had when still captive in the human world. Another couple—this time parakeets—are impressed by the fresh newspapers their host has laid out for their arrival (1:205). But more often than not Farsidians mimic our ways. Even at the microscopic level, they attend conventions and wear name tags—as we learn from Larson's depiction of an "amoebae convention" (1:639). Dogs have their own real estate agents: a salesman, showing potential buyers a new house, points out the handy adjoining toilet facilities: a "tree right off the master bedroom" (1:570). Birds send out for pizza and are upset that, 28.1 October 2005</page><page sequence="6">76 Lavery due to some mix up, they have gotten the one with anchovies—or at least the bird equivalent: "We didn't order stink bugs on this thing!" one com plains (1:250). They even have their own L. Ron Hubbards: a cow, ped dling consciousness-raising door-to-door, passes out brochures on "Cowintology" (2:7). Flies go out for a romantic "Evening on a beached whale" and are pleased to be seated by the fountain, that is, the blow-hole (1:574). Animals have their own cars. Flies put "MAGGOT ON BOARD" signs in the rear window (1:626); and cows not only hang manure-scented air "fresheners" on the rear-view mirror (2:149) but also have their own rush-hour, helicopter-borne traffic reporters, commenting on the move ments of the herd (2:28). Farsidians also have very human problems with proper etiquette and moral behavior. Dogs must teach their children proper table manners, according to their fashion; a mother dog lectures her son Sparky to eat with his mouth open (1:262), while other dogs have not yet learned the proper way to behave in mixed company: for example, an uncouth dog in a cartoon called "Canine social blunders," in the midst of pleasant chatter about new collars, cats, and chasing squirrels, drops a conversation-stop ping bombshell: "Say, I just found out yesterday I've got worms" (1:557). Salmon must debate the proper place of sex-education. Larson shows us "The committee to decide whether spawning should be taught in school" (2:89). Vicious predators attend "Maneaters Anonymous" meetings, where confession is good for the soul (1:523). And insects and snakes are sick enough to have their own strip joints, where on-stage metamorphosis (2: 137) and moulting (1:317) arouse the audience, and even species-spe cific telephone sex lines (2:126). Farsidians, however, are sometimes troubled by inexplicable fears and panic terrors, the result of their hybrid existence between the instinc tual and the cultural. A snake safely curled with hundreds of its kind in a den is overcome by a very human-like fear of slithery things: "Hey, I feel something moving! Dang, this place gives me the willies," he confesses (1: 425). A prairie dog develops claustrophobia and a terrible fear that his tunnel is closing in on him (1:422). A bee in a hive is driven bonkers by an Studies in Popular Culture</page><page sequence="7">The Radical Anthropomorphism of The Far Side 77 "incessant buzzing sound" (1:192). An ostrich becomes suddenly aware of his species' strange appearance. "For crying out loud, Norm," he con fesses to a fellow ostrich, "Look at you ... I hope I don't look half as gooney when I run" (1: 397). The microscopic organisms on a scientist's slide become aware, in a Pascalian reversal, that they are being watched. From the slide comes horrified screams of "The Eye! The Eye!" (1:155). A steer awakens abruptly, screaming about his nightmare: "The Golden arches got me!" (1:235). And the life of a family of fleas becomes, instead of joy, the stuff of a horror film as they endure the repeated attacks of a monstrous creature from the outer world—the dog on whom they have set up housekeeping: "The Claw! The Claw is back! Where are the chil dren?" (1: 203). Indeed, the creatures of the Far Side actually have their own horror films at which they vicariously experience threats to their existence much more realistic that Jason's ax or Leatherneck's chain saw. In "Horror films of the Wild" (2:33), for example, a movie audience of fright-loving deer shout warnings to one of their kind about to open the genre's pro verbial secret closed door. (For the audience is aware, as the on-screen deer is not, of the danger that awaits. For all about hang relics of the occupant's former killings: stuffed and mounted heads of other bucks and does.) And in other cartoons a group of insects gather in a theater to watch the species-specific horror sequel, "Return of the Killer Windshield" (1: 64), and cobras line up for a showing of "The Mongoose Came at Midnight" (1: 138). Farsidians even attend human horror films—as we know from the pigeon shown rallying his kind to scare a woman in the park with the question, "How many here have ever seen Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds!" (1:371). Inexplicably, Larson's creatures permit the instruments of destruc tion into their own households. A young slug named Eddie is warned by his mother not to run about the house carrying a saltshaker (1:561). In the corner of an ant household stands a magnifying glass. "You know," one ant protests, "I wish you'd get rid of that hideous thing and I think it's just plain dangerous to have one in the house" (1:601). And a family of rats 28.1 October 2005</page><page sequence="8">78 Lavery inexplicably keeps rat poison in the cupboard, "right next to the cereal" (1:407). In the world of The Far Side instinct often appears to be breaking down. Critics like Gregory Bateson have dismissed our understanding of instinct as tautological and unscientific, incapable of explaining anything. Instinct, Bateson contends, is in fact only a name—a "black box" con cept, as philosophers of science call it—in which we pigeonhole all that we do not understand about the "unconscious" behavior of the animal world. In reality, "instinct" is still a total mystery, and it is no less so for Farsidians. An elderly, decrepit, couch potato moose, a beer can in hoof, mired in front of a television set, does not know what to make of "the call of the wild" his hair-in-curlers wife has just received on the telephone (1: 21). And many Far Side animals are similarly confounded. No instinctual ability has perplexed scientists more than the unfath omable achievement of migration, but in The Far Side birds seem to have completely lost their bearings. "If we could teach geography to the carrier pigeon," Carl-Gustav Carus once noted, "its unconscious flight, which finds its goal straight-away, would immediately become an impossibility" (qtd. in Cioran 64). In the too conscious world of The Far Side, a flock of geese finds the mysteries of migration beyond its ken and must resort to a map to regain their sense of direction (1: 206). Ducks, walking with precision in V-formation, cannot even remember to fly and look on in pedestrian amazement and admiration at aerial migration (1: 248). Yet another duck, totally domesticated, must rely pitifully on a couple of middle aged humans to drive him south for the winter (1:338). One even boards a plane, from which he sticks out his tongue at his self-propelled fellows doing it the hard way (2:11). Migration is hardly the only instinctive ability gone awry in The Far Side. Yet another group of ducks sits attentively in a classroom undergo ing instruction in "Beginning Duck" (1:577), their own animal speech now equally as mysterious as migration, so unnatural, in fact, that they must even submit themselves to the horrors of sentence diagramming in order to acquire their native language and become responsible ducks. Salmon Studies in Popular Culture</page><page sequence="9">The Radical Anthropomorphism of The Far Side 79 need the assistance of "Sam's Spawning Service," lured, no doubt, by his catchy slogan: "When you gotta get upstream in a hurry!" (1: 641). A bull—improbably named Larry—must be reminded by his cohorts out side the ring that he is supposed to charge the bullfighter's cape (1:259). A bird, having forgotten how to fly, must climb down from his high nest on a makeshift ladder of knotted sheets (the cartoon is called "Stupid birds"). Two ticks can't even find their way around the maze of a typical dog and must resort to a mega-mall-style "You Are Here" directory to chart their path (1:594). A chameleon needs psychotherapy in order to practice his protective mimicry (1:376). And dogs, legendarily gifted with the innate ability to detect fear in a human, must resort instead to a "Fear-o-Sensor" to inspect a salesman invading their territory (1:589); or rely on the "new ACME Stick-Be-Found" in order to merely play catch—they even en dorse the product for television (1:527). In another compartment of Larson's world, the "animal Self-help section," we can find an Ibu reading a book on How to Avoid Natural Selection, a porcupine learning how to Hibernate the Easy Way, an ant eater discovering how to Do It by Instinct, and other books are likewise available on such important topics as how to Become One With the Herd! and Predator-Prey Relationships (1: 411). Or perhaps The Far Side has caught the contagion of self-help from the neighboring human world, where centipedes now "run" rampant, even if they no longer know how to walk, breathe, eat, play tennis, or have sex without expert instruction. For other creatures of The Far Side, however, instinct is simply no longer sufficient. These beings seem about to surmount nature's gover nance and enter the world of consciousness, though with varying degrees of success. Sometimes, despite glimmers of self-awareness, these semi conscious animals appear to be no more than dupes. In one cartoon, insects walk with trepidation through a burial ground of their own kind— a collection of pinned and mounted bugs—without any real understanding of the cause of their anxiety. "Gad, I hate walking through this place at night," one confesses (1:157). In another, bug-eyed canines anxiously await yet another monotonous meal as if it were a gourmet original: "Oh 28.1 October 2005</page><page sequence="10">80 Lavery boy!... It's dog food AGAIN!" (1:257). Sitting at the witness stand, an alligator defends itself against charges of murder by accepting willingly the accusation that the act was "cold-blooded": "I am a reptile," he rational izes (1:369). And a dog, excited but cruelly mistaken, anticipates a trip to the vet: "Ha ha ha, Biff," he gloats to a neighbor dog from the window of a passing car. "Guess what? After we go the drugstore and the post of fice, I'm going to the vet's to get tutored" (1:485). Other adventures in consciousness lead to confusion and disillusion ment. In hunting season a buck, like a typical Hitchcockian innocent vic tim, becomes confused about why he has been singled out for extermina tion by a perfect stranger: "He's trying to kill me, all right," the buck con templates, hiding behind a tree. "Do I know this guy? Γve got to think!" (1:381). Dinosaurs gather in a lecture hall to listen to an expert, professo rial Tyrannosaurus Rex, contemplate the future extinction of their kind, and though his insight into their predicament is quite contemporary, his knowledge provides no solution: "The world's climates are changing, the mammals are taking over, and we all have a brain about the size of a walnut" (1:524). A group of dog scientists works hard but unsuccessfully to solve an enigma, the mystery of the door knob, which has held them back from a true evolutionary advance—and from getting at a cat outside the window (1:509). And two cows sitting in a modern living room are perplexed by the constant ringing of a telephone which their lack of a manipulative digit will not permit them to answer. How they managed to develop the "civilization" which gave them their TV, sofa, and telephone without opposable thumbs, we do not know (1:378). The new consciousness, the suspension of the old ways, may even lead to extremely sick behavior on the part of former vegetarians, as in a cartoon which shows a cow, chefs hat on his head, cannibalistically grill ing steaks on a farmyard grill. "You're sick, Jessy!—Sick, sick, sick!" a commentator proclaims (2: 68). Another Far Side cow even drives a delivery truck for a meat market (1:490). Still other creatures, however, poised on the very brink of self-aware ness, seem about to make a quantum leap into a new evolutionary level. A Studies in Popular Culture</page><page sequence="11">The Radical Anthropomorphism of The Far Side 81 revolutionary sheep encourages his kind not just to be part of the herd (1: 252). A cow awakens from bovine oblivion to discover with disgust the degrading nature of its diet: "Hey, wait a minute!" it exclaims. "This is grass! We've been eating grass!" (1:160). A dog, sick of pleading for under-the-table handouts, decides to take matters into its own hands by drawing a gun on its owners (2:53). Lions see through an animal tamer's trickery: "He's using blanks—pass it on," one hon explains. In a similar cartoon, a trained bear discovers that his restraining muzzle can be unfas tened: "Well, hey... these things just snap right off' (1:307). And two apes, are appalled at the description of themselves they discover in the notebooks of a Dian Fossey-Jane Goodall-like student of animal behav ior (1:485). The increasing consciousness of some animals even seems to in clude a rudimentary understanding of Darwinian evolution and ethology, the study of animal behavior. In a cartoon entitled "Natural selection at work," for example, wolves carefully determine in advance which mem bers of a flock of sheep should be allowed to survive and which should properly perish. A bear seeks to convince a companion that the telling evolutionary evidence of their claws and fangs strongly suggests that their kind should slay and eat some nearby park visitors instead of limiting themselves to honey and berries (1:160). Similarly, a hyena expresses its distaste for its given role as a scavenger: "Listen," he confesses, "I'm fed up with this 'weeding out the sick and the old' business... I want some thing in its prime" (1: 359). Or two peahens, their feminist consciousness raised, are able to resist the entrapment of a typically male display (1: 131). And dogs attend a lecture where cat machinations are exposed— with the use of slides, of course: "we can see how the cornered cat has seemed to suddenly grow bigger Trickery!" (1:478). When all is said and done, however, Gary Larson's allegiance would seem to he with the animal, not the human, world—as two particular car toons make apparent. In a prehistoric scene, wolves look on at a former cohort, now under the sway of the human world and don't like what they see: "It's Bob, all right... but look at those vacuous eyes, that stupid grin 28.1 October 2005</page><page sequence="12">82 Lavery on his face—he's been domesticated I tell you" (1:643). From the begin ning, The Far Side seems to be telling us, the world of nature, the gover nance of instinct, have probably been preferable to domestication with all its debilitating side effects. To be human, Far Side after Far Side demon strates for us, is, quite simply, to be unnatural, sometimes ridiculous. For Gary Larson, anthropomorphism is an insult, and that is why Far Side animals are funny, embarrassingly funny, mirrors. In The Far Side there are hints as well that all we take to be human, including our utter domination of the animal world, our beastly treatment of them, may, when the rapture comes, prove in the end to be an illusion. When they finally get out of the doghouse our smug humanism has put them in and return to preeminence, they may get their revenge. In one cartoon, as dog-bearing flying saucers hover overhead, the family pet addresses his owner: "Well they finally came... but before I go, let's see you roll over a couple of times" (1:379).
