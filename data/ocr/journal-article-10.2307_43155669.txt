The data show that, overall, fewer observations about the animals are made at the farm whereas more affective comments are generated there. The farm visitors surprisingly commented in over a third of conversations about other aspects of the animal's environment and about locating these non-exhibit animals, although this was significantly less than the number of similar comments made in the zoo. Farm visits could be developed to help children learn how to observe body structures and learn about general features of animal groups, particularly mammals and birds, before embarking on a zoo visit where a more extensive range of animal groups, and examples within each group, may be observed. i</page><page sequence="2">Introduction Teachers use many resources to assist their students in learning. Visits to zoos and farms are a part of these resources, yet we know relatively little about either the focus and outcomes of such visits nor of the relative merits of different sites, farm and zoo, in terms of the educational opportunity for students. Tîiis paper addresses several questions associated with field visits made by elementary school students to look at farm animals and explores the potential of farm visits as a learning experience within a student's curriculum. Students are taken during their school careers to look at live animals in different types of location. Both zoos and farms may be unfamiliar at first to students who have learned about exotic animals from the media and nursery toys. Farm animals, too, may be unfamiliar to children and their knowledge, again, is largely obtained through nursery toys, books, and what is viewed through the media. Zoo animals are shown as exhibits with labels and in distinct and identifiable enclosures. The first question is, "Do animals which can be looked at, but are not shown as exhibits, elicit similar responses from elementary students?". Second, 'Does the role of the animal in the human context elicit different attitudes and other comments?". Farm animals are primarily kept as sources of food for humans whereas zoo animals, albeit the focus of conservation biology projects, are kept for visitors to view. Looking at the zoo animal is the reason for visiting the zoo. Do students and the accompanying adults notice similar attributes about animals and express the same kinds of emotional comments when viewing zoo animals and farm animals? Attributes of animals which are used in classification purposes in early biology education are those that are seen, and hence these features may be observed and discussed by most visitors if they posses a mutually comprehensible vocabulary about the subject. The English school curriculum requires that children learn to group animals (DfE 1995: 40 &amp; 45) and varies in the detail required, although, in essence, it expects children to learn to label with a name and allocate animals to named groups in a simple classical Linnean taxonomy, and to identify the key life processes. The National Curriculum expects that primary children should be taught: 2</page><page sequence="3">KS 1 (5-7 years): the differences between things that are living and things that have never been alive; that animals, including humans, move, feed, grow, use their senses and reproduce; that living things can be grouped according to observable similarities and differences. KS 2 (7-11 years): that there are life processes, including nutrition, movement, growth, reproduction, common to all animals, including humans; how locally occurring animals and plants can be identified and assigned to groups, using keys. Keil (1979) considers that 'animal' is one of a human beings fundamental ontological concepts, while Looft (1974) considers that children learn to recognize that certain things are alive before they can justify the categorization of the item. Although children do cite a range of attributes in their rationale for deeming something as an 'animal' or for allocating it to a subordinate category, existing research shows that younger children use movement as a key attribute (Osborne, Black, &amp; Wadsworth, 1 993). As children develop they refer particularly to legs and body covering (Trowbridge &amp; Mintzes, 1988). Such a partiality suggests that body parts are a fundamental aspect of the concept of 'animal' for primary children. Other biological concepts, such as nutrition, respiration, and habitat, are cited by children in early secondary school (Bell, 198 1) and, if referred to by younger children, such usage suggests evidence of taught and recalled information because the level of physiological and ecological knowledge necessary to understand the process is not possessed by most pupils of this age. Young children look for prominent features of objects (Tversky, 1 989) and the size of an animal is an important attribute for them because they intuitively consider that physically smaller animals are at an earlier stage in their life history than larger and similar specimens (Looft, 1 97 1 ), even when the animals are of different species (Looft &amp; Charles, 1969). Students have a mixed view of the concept 'animal,' a view that it is based on attributes they have observed - anatomical features such as legs and color; behaviors, such as movement and feeding, and linked with concepts such as habitat and irritability that they have been taught in school. The inability of eleven year olds to classify exemplars given to them as a 3</page><page sequence="4">member/non member of a taxonomie group suggests that students of this age may have no grasp of the criteria necessary to perform such a task (Ryman, 1977). Primary aged students are likely to simply allocate animals to an identity category with which they are familiar from their everyday experiences. School children taken to the zoo or the farm know that they are to see animals. I was interested whether they would comment about their observations and interpretations of these in a similar manner at zoo animals and at farm animals. Animals observed in the zoo were being exhibited. This very factor of looking at 'an exhibit' could have affected the content of comments of visitors at these exhibits. Did this occur? The main differences between farm animals and those in a zoo are that: farm animals are not exhibited; there are few species on a farm; farm animals are likely to be familiar to visitors; farm animals are not associated with conservation programs; farm animals are not from a distinct geographical area. One particular issue was whether exhibiting an animal in a special 'exhibit' place - the zoo - and providing labels and different enclosures designed for particular animals would affect the proportions of conversations with at least one comment about the attributes of the animals. The central questions of this study were, first, whether farm animals and zoo animals elicit similar proportions of categories of comments. Second, whether the effect of animals being exhibited in a place where visitors go in order to see and study animals, which have a definite enclosure, a label, and the provision of viewing positions for visitors, focus the children's attention on aspects of the animals to a lesser or greater extent than occurs on a farm? Through listening and analyzing the content of conversations of similar primary school groups at both locations the question stated in the previous sentence can be answered. Methodology I recorded 707 conversational segments generated in either London Zoo in 1992 or Burchetts Green Farm, Maidenhead in 1994 by primary school children and their accompanying adults, teachers or chaperones, of which 459 were generated in the zoo and 248 on the farm. I accompanied children and their adults and tape recorded their 4</page><page sequence="5">conversations after receiving permission to do so from the teacher in charge of the party. I stood behind the groups of children and their accompanying adult and moved with the group until they broke off from observing animals to be involved in some other activity such as a classroom talk or lunch. One-third of the farm children were seven years or younger, the majority were year 4 (eight to nine year olds) or under, whereas two- thirds of the groups visiting the zoo contained children of seven and under (Tunnicliffe, 1995). Thus, the overall majority of conversations were from children under seven. In both groups there was a mixture of demographics origins ranging from children of non-Caucasian backgrounds who lived in urban areas to Caucasian children from rural parts. The number of species that the visitors could see was heavily unbalanced. The zoo contained many different species representing nearly all classes of the animal kingdom, whereas the farm contained four different mammals, pigs, cows, sheep, and horses and the students saw some wild birds. The transcripts were coded using a systemic network, which was constructed based on the work of Bliss, Ogborn, and Martin, (1983), and which had been designed after examining data collected from pilot studies. A systemic network is a means of grouping or categorizing things, in this case conversations, to be a parsimonious representation of the data, while preserving the relationships between categories in such a way that comparisons can be made between groups. The network can be regarded analogously as the sets of boxes into which the researcher puts each part of the conversation. A range of variables was created from the coded data and each category of variable was used to code the conversations in the transcripts. Full details of the methodology have been reported elsewhere (Tunnicliffe 1 995, 1996a;b). The animal behavior section of the network is shown in Figure 1. Essentially the elements of a conversational exchange were allocated to a category which had been given a number within the coding network. The incidence of each category was entered into a data base and the totals were found. At one extreme of the continuum along which the conversations were categorized are highly specific items, while at the other end is the main descriptor, in this case 'group's comments. The numbers at the right of the figure label the most specific level of table categorization. 5</page><page sequence="6">1 I c &lt;4-1 0 4- I c 1 V ä o • H &gt; cd JZ &lt;u « r- 1 £ $ 3 8 8 p; 8 ^ 5 .2 .2 .2 .2 .2 .2 I 1 Ii II !

The final network required a total of 74 terminals to describe the children's conversational content. The four main categories of the network were: Management and Social comments, e.g. Look!, Miss!, Lisa look here; Ostensive comments providing exhibit access - that is comments which assist the visitor in finding the animal, e.g. Oh look at that!, Where is it?, It is up there; Other exhibit comments on labels, furniture, the setting and other features, e.g. ...on the branch, It's by the hedge, ..its feeding bowl; Animal focused comments with six subcategories of comment on body parts, e.g. ..legs, It's big; behaviors, e.g. It's moving over here, It's eating; names and naming, e.g. It's a lion, ...that cow; environmental aspects, e.g. it's endangered, It comes from the desert; comments of an affective or emotive nature, e.g. I like that, It's cruel to keep them like that; interpretative comments, e.g. anthropomorphic type, It's like granddad'; provided information usage, e.g. The label says..; knowledge source comments - providing or seeking, such as, I saw one on the TV, What is it?, or authenticity comments such as, Is it real?. Various other descriptive demographic data, such as, the types of animal observed and the type of adult accompanying the group, were also recorded. The zoo groups had undertaken their visit with science work in mind, particularly the grouping of animals and the variety of life. The farm visits held a wider brief and were associated with history and technology work about farms as well as science work about processes of life and life cycles. Taxonomy was not a particular feature of the work. The principal purpose of this research was both to ascertain the types of responses elicited from the children and their accompanying adults by the animal exhibit, and to obtain the range of responses to exhibits. Thus the number of instances of any one comment were not counted within each unit of conversation. So, in the context of any conversation, the first use of any category was recorded, and additional comments in that category were ignored. This approach to recording the content of exchanges at the animal exhibits reveals patterns in the range of topics about which the visitors commented at least once within their utterances at an animal exhibit. 7</page><page sequence="8">An example of a unit of conversation is shown below: Boy: Look at that one, they are coming really close to us. Adult: It's standing there staring at you ! Boy: Right down there, it's sitting down. It's been sat like that for ages, just going like that. Boy 2: Yes. The first two lines of the same exchange coded according to the categories of the network are represented as follows: 73 / 20 / 35 / 40 Boy: Look /at that one, /they are coming/ really close to us. 20 / 35 / 40 /1 Adult It's /standing /there /staring at you ! The length of the conversations collected at both sites were similar, between two and five utterances in length in the majority of cases. In order to assess the reliability of the network, a second person independently categorized 20 conversational units of the zoo generated conversations which provided 434 instances of a category. There was 92% agreement. The re-marker disagreed with 5 instances of coding. All the data were coded by the researcher alone. Results The school data for London Zoo can be compared with the data for similar age groups visiting the farm. The results of such a comparison of main categories are shown in Table 1 . Table 2 shows the results of a comparison of the categories of animal observations. Table 1 shows that management/social comments were a major focus of both groups and that they generated comments which were concerned with the source of knowledge or finding out information and made observations about body parts and behavior in similar numbers. However, the farm visitors were predominantly concerned with affective comments: zoo groups with interpretative comments, which they generated to a 8</page><page sequence="9">Table 1 Comparison of contents of conversations amongst school groups at zoo animals ( exhibited animals ) and Burchetts Green Farm (non-exhibited animals ) Category Zoo animals Farm animals X,2 probability n= 459 n = 248 no % no % Management/social 354 77 196 79 0.34 Exhibit access 289 63 96 39 38.16 p&lt;0.005 Otherexhibit comments 227 50 91 37 10.61 p&lt;0.005 Animal focused Body parts 280 61 139 56 1.64 Behaviour 301 66 129 52 12.43 p&lt;0.005 Naming 401 87 105 42 160.42 p&lt;0.005 Affective attitudes 193 42 153 62 24.87 p&lt;0.005 emotive 143 32 113 46 14.47 p&lt;0.005 Interpretative comments 443 97 196 79 56.60 p&lt;0.005 knowledge source 254 55 127 51 1.10 authenticity 41 9 13 5 3.11 Environmental 19 4 10 N/A significantly greater extent, and naming the animal in some way in nearly all exchanges. Farm visitors made a significant number of 'other exhibit' comments - feeding utensils and so forth, even though the animals were in fields, in most instances, and not in purpose-built enclosures with labels. Although fewer of the farm visitors' conversations contained these 'other exhibit' comments than was the case for the zoo visitors' comments, the fact that 37%, over a third, of them did is noteworthy, given that the animals were not formal exhibits. This suggests that visitors use phenomena within 9</page><page sequence="10">the environment to set the animals in context and that observing the whole scene is important to them. The similarity of the management/social component of conversations at the farm to that generated in the zoo is striking because the farm environment was less structured, smaller, and not designed with visitors in mind. The data in Table 2 show that animal-focused comments were less apparent within the farm and that the focus on naming manifest within the zoo was not present. Visitors simply identified or acknowledged the domestic animals which were pigs, horses, sheep, and cattle (cows and bulls) and crows - everyday animals. Farm groups made significantly more affective and emotive comments than did zoo groups. Overall both groups commented to a similar extent about the anatomy or body parts of the animals, although the zoo groups made significantly more comments in the subcategories of dimensions - size, shape, color. Farm groups commented more on 'unfamiliar' aspects such as horns and hooves. The zoo groups mentioned disrupters such as legs and tails significantly more often. Zoo groups mentioned behaviors overall significantly more than did farm groups and the subcategories of position of the animal and movement were commented upon significantly more at zoo animals (see Table 2). Although overall the number of conversations in the interpretative category were significantly greater at the zoo animals, there were significantly more conversations generated at the farm animals that mentioned at least once a human interpretation of the animal. Discussion The school visit to a farm is more of an affective visit than is a school visit to a zoo, which in turn is a more affective experience than is a family visit to the same site (Tunnicliffe 1995, 1996a). Overall both groups commented to the same extent about the anatomy of animals by zoo groups made significantly more comments about behavior, naming and interpretation. Both groups generate similar numbers of management and social comments but, although exhibit access and other exhibit comments were generated significantly more by the zoo groups, the fact that these comments were heard in over one third of the conversations of the farm visitors indicates the importance for people of setting an animal in acontext. 10</page><page sequence="11">Table 2 Comparison between animal focused content of conversations generated by school groups at animal exhibits in London Zoo and non-exhibit animals at a farm.

Girl 2: Ah, little lambs. A possible reason for the far lower number of conversations with at least one reference to a naming comment within the farm groups may be that many exchanges occurred at the same animal type. There were a 1 1</page><page sequence="12">number of individuals for any one species of farm animal, for example a flock of sheep in a field, and, once the type to which the animal belonged had been recognized, the groups conducted conversations about the specimens without mentioning again their identity. It is interesting that the groups mentioned body parts of the animals in similar proportions. Such a finding suggests that a description of observable prominent features is important to people in a group looking at animals. Zoo visitors mentioned behavior at least once in a conversation significantly more often than farm visitors, but most animal behavior viewed on a farm is familiar to visitors, and only the unfamiliar, such as mounting of cows by bulls, or particularly noticeable, such as urination, were mentioned. In the exchange used as the example for coding the conversations the children noticed that a particular individual sheep had 'been sat like that for ages ' . On the other hand, zoo animals are probably less familiar to the school group members, and recognizing and commenting on a familiar activity performed by an unfamiliar animal is worthy of note. Another possible explanation for the higher number of behavior comments at the zoo is that zoo visitors mentioned the position of animals; this was judged by the researcher to be a behavior of the animal. Position of the animals in the farm was less important in conversations because the animals were easily seen. The number of conversations with at least one interpretative comment was significantly lower at the farm, presumable because the children could identify the type of animal, unlike the situation in the zoo where group members asked 'What is it?', or referred to the labels, of which there were none in the farm. Comments about the human-like actions or appearance of the animals were heard at least once in a conversation significantly more at the farm animals, which were all mammals, suggesting, that the more familiar an animal is to its viewer and the more similar to humans, the more likely the viewer is to ascribe the animal human characteristics. Mammals are only a proportion of the animals seen during a zoo visit. The farm offered a less structured environment in terms of learning experience because it did not provide labels for the animals, and a narrower diversity of form of animals. Even though labels are rarely referred to 12</page><page sequence="13">(Tunnicliffe, 1995) their existence suggests a structured information provision by the institution for the visitor, who can 'take it or leave it' . As a consequence, the significantly higher proportion of the comments containing emotive categories among groups visiting the farm, where information is expected to come from the self or the group (see Table 1 ) was not surprising. The data indicate that farms are places for generating emotional comments, whereas the zoo is a site for factual observations and naming. However, in both sites, overall comments about body parts of animals were mentioned in similar numbers which is surprising if pupils visiting the zoo were being taught scientific naming of animals using specific structural attributes as the necessary features for taxonomy. The result suggests that the pupils at the zoo were not learning the reasons for naming animals, but merely passing observational comments about parts of the bodies which they noticed. The farm displayed familiar animals involved 'n familiar activities and, in conjunction with the lack of educational orientation and tasks, conversations turned to the affective domain as a topic for conversation, because one was needed to fill the conversation void. The comparison between the content of conversations generated at animal specimens in the zoo and on the farm was made to explore whether exhibiting an animal made an impact on the categories about which visitors commented. It does. The comparison of the farm and zoo data shows that, although the farm school visitors generated significantly more affective and fewer interpretative and behavior comments than school visitors at the zoo, both types of animals elicited similar numbers of conversations from visitors with at least one comment about body parts, knowledge source comments and management/social categories. The far higher number of conversations in the zoo which contained at least one naming comment is not surprising because of the familiarity to the visitors of the farm animals, the far fewer species on display and the far more specimens of each type that could be seen. Moreover, the farm animals were able to be seen in their fields or stalls much more easily than were the exhibited zoo animals in their enclosures. Such findings suggest that farm visits couldbe developed to help children learn how to observe body structures and learn about general features of the animal groups, particularly mammals and birds, 13</page><page sequence="14">before embarking on a zoo visit where a more extensive range of animal groups, and examples within each group, may be observed. This study shows that the site where the animal specimens are observed and the manner in which they are 'available for viewing' have an important influence on the content of the conversations of the visitors. Farm animals, which were not exhibited in the museum sense as were the zoo animals, elicited predominantly affective, including emotive, responses from the school groups but fewer comments about behavior. It is interesting to note the similar number of conversations that referred at least once to body parts of the animals and this similarity suggests that these attributes are the basic ones noticed and commented upon by school groups and their adults, irrespective of the species of animal and its status as an exhibit or not. Exhibit access, 'other exhibit' comments and those comments related to interpreting the animals in their surroundings were generated by the school groups significantly more in the zoo. These data are not surprising because the farm animals are not formally exhibited. However, the number of conversations with management and or social comments are similar, reflecting the ethos of a school visit. Naming comments, not surprisingly, occurred at least once in a conversational segment significantly less among the farm animals where the four species viewed were familiar to the school groups and were referred to with the basic names employed everyday. When the farm data are compared with data from similar school groups but which was generated at live zoo animals it is apparent that the act of exhibiting an animal focused the content of the conversations. Affective comments were significantly fewer (p&lt; 0.005) whereas comments related to aspects of exhibits and behavior of the widely diverse kinds of animals viewed were significantly more. Observational comments of the groups focus particularly on behaviors of the animals, there are significantly fewer affective comments generated and a much wider range of comments about the surroundings in which the visitors viewed the animals. School groups named farm animals - which were fewer in diversity and were all familiar - significantly (p&lt;0.005) less than they did the zoo animals. School visits to farms elicited even more affective responses than did similar visits to zoos. In the spectrum of companion animals, which 14</page><page sequence="15">runs from free living wild animals to pet animals kept at home, farm animals are nearer the pet image than are zoo animals and this may account for the more affective emphasis that was found in this analysis of conversational content. Farm animals are used by us for utilitarian purposes and their potential as food, although not verbalized by the groups, may have affected the attitudes of the visitors to the animals. Farm visits should be planned as an integral part of a student's science education. They also link with humanities and language arts. A farm visit should: •be undertaken in a child's educational career before that to a zoo or museum to look at animal specimens because the non-exhibit status of farm animals elicits fewer spontaneous observations than at a zoo visit. The visit should be used to establish the form and function of the anatomy of the animals viewed so that the zoo visit can focus on diversity; •follow work in school on pets and other everyday animals such as birds and native mammals such as ground hogs; •reinforce language arts activities on naming and describing, reporting events using the past tense; •have command of the appropriate vocabulary and be able to use it; •class based work on grouping by observable features such as type of body covering or number of toes; •follow class work on making and using simple identification keys; •have studied fermentation; •have studied the digestive process and know about the through gut concept of most animals. •learned about the food cycle and producers and consumers; •learned and be able to identify characteristic features of herbivores and carnivores; •know about the place of human beings in the food chains; •have an awareness of some of the ethical issues associated with human/animal relationships •be familiar with the science process and be able to raise questions, make predictions, design studies, collect and record observations and evaluate it. 15</page><page sequence="16">A visit to a farm can be an important stage in a child's learning about animals, between that of the home and classroom learning and that in a zoo or museum, and then in the field. Farms tend to be closer to schools and not charge for admission. They rarely have educational facilities but in terms of money spent, it could be good value if teachers use the visit to enhance science-or other curriculum areas. However, unless teachers plan their visits with clear educational objectives in mind, an educational focus is unlikely to be realized because farms exist primarily to farm, not to provide animals as exhibits. Without focus from teachers, students make everyday commentaries, as they do in zoos, but, because the animals are not exhibited, the students notice even less than they do in zoos and focus on affective comments.
