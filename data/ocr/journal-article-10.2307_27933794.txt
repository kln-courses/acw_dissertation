Harris _ Ofra Bengio displays both her considerable erudition and her exacting knowledge of Arabic language etymology in this well-researched but somewhat disappointing study of the relationship between discourse and totalitarianism in Iraqi political culture. Her narrative is composed in a blended chronological and thematic order; this is largely attributable to one of the two major themes guiding her study; namely, the shift in the Iraqi political arena from a "secular, leftist, and socialist" (203) discourse to one dominated by empty Islamic signs. Her presentation of this discursive trend is sophisticated, nuanced, and well-documented. Bengio devotes considerable effort towards a discussion of the incessant use of mythico-historical elements in the Ba'thi political idiom. (15, 77) She focuses on the instrumentalism apparent in the regime's manipulation of these powerful emotional symbols throughout the work. (123, 173) One example she gives concerns the use of the word fitna by the regime to describe the Kurdish uprising in the aftermath of the Gulf War because of its Islamic connotation, rather than a civil war (harb ahliyya), the more common term. Her nuanced approach to treating this material is also commendable; in this vein, she notes the attempt by the regime to co-opt the Iraqi population by constructing cults around historical personalities and events, rather than merely tapping into existing allegiances. (5) The author assigns two main functions to this manipulation of Islamic discourse: a safety valve to release religiously expressed popular pressure and a tool for mass Gregory J.

(160) It is unfortunate that she mentions, but does not explain, Saddam Husayn's use of Islamic rhetoric in official correspondence with George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev. (198) While this omission may not cast serious doubt on her conclusions, this peculiar instance does suggest that the use of the Islamic idiom by the regime in recent years may be more than simply instrumental. Was the text of the message itself meant to be published inside Iraq? Did that message sharply differ in tone from other Allied-Iraqi correspondence? Bengio does not elaborate. Yet while this part of her argument is relatively strong, a major underlying assumption upon which it is built is not. Here, and throughout the work, the author makes the epistemological error of conflating regime rhetoric with evidence of the collective psyche of the Iraqi people, noting that, "in Arab-Muslim societies, the line dividing the present and the past is not firm and clear-cut." (30) This type of ill-reasoned generalization is inexplicable in light of the author's clear erudition and depth of analysis. Perhaps generated by the commonplace use of mythico-historical discourse in modern politics, this is hardly a strictly Middle Eastern problem, and it is both careless and inaccurate to suggest that Arabs and Muslims are incapable of clearly discerning between past and present, myth and reality. Bengio explores several other themes in considerable depth. The first of these is Saddam's personal political idiom and its permeation of Iraqi political discourse, as seen primarily in the work of journalists and lower-level political figures with whom he enjoys a direct connection. (8, 11, 78) In a strong passage, the author notes the cult of personality expressed in the Iraqi media, citing a reference to Iraqi soldiers in battle as "millions of al-Mansur Saddam Husayn." (82) Bengio fails, however, to explore the publication of the Iraqi leader's political dictionary as a deliberate attempt to control political discourse in Iraq, (181) choosing instead to portray this relationship as a maximizing strategy by both politicians and journalists. She also misses the opportunity to compare this with opposition literature from the Sunni Arab heart of the regime's power base, in order to determine whether such groups contest the same symbols, thus suggesting some broader resonance to them. The second of these prominent themes deals with the attempt of the regime to excite emotion rather than appeal to rationality through its political discourse. (7) Though Bengio bases this assertion on Ba'thi documents, (9) she overextends herself again, suggesting that Arab orators in general use vocabulary designed to produce emotional responses rather than influence rational thought, omitting that this is, to a greater or lesser extent, standard political practice the world over. The adaptive and reactive nature of Iraqi political discourse is the third significant theme Bengio treats in this work. She notes the early adoption by the Ba'th of the popular language of the Iraqi Communist Party, (11) a pattern that has continued through the 1990s with the adoption of the increasingly popular Islamic political idiom; (176) that is, a discourse that attempts to mobilize powerful religious symbols for political purposes. She also notes the regime's appropriation of the terms "democracy, liberalism, and parliamentarianism," which it then "emptied ... of their original content. The forms became mere labels and were no longer dangerous." (13) Bengio's works suggests that both sets of symbols have been recognized by the</page><page sequence="3">Harris 185 regime to have some symbolic power, but the inconsistencies between their meaning and regime policies have compelled their use in name only. A fourth theme revolves around the use of repetition in the Iraqi political discourse, about which the author makes two claims. First, she asserts that public statements by the regime tend to be substituted for actions. "There is therefore no 'confusion between words and action, but rather a psychologically conditioned substitution of words for action.'"1 Second, Bengio suggests that this constant repetition ultimately has shaped the way Iraqis perceive their political space. (77) In light of her much more convincing demonstration of the total subordination of that space and the media to the regime, however, the evidence for this second claim is somewhat ambiguous. Much of her source material is drawn from such official or officially censored Iraqi media sources, and it is likely to be quite difficult to accurately gauge popular perceptions from such material. The final significant theme she treats is the use of rhetoric by the regime to prepare the Iraqi polity for action. (140, 207) The author notes that, in the case of the Iran-Iraq war, this verbal preparation made war "likely, if not inevitable." (153) Treating the relationship between popular support and government policy is problematic, however, even in the most democratic of societies; in an authoritarian regime it is even more so. This is evidenced at least in part by Bengio's lack of firm evidence and supporting documentation on this point. The constraints imposed on the Iraqi regime as a result of its own propaganda seem greatly overestimated here. One of the strongest aspects of Bengio's work is her utilization of etymology to inform her analysis of the Iraqi political idiom. She illustrates points on imperialism, revolution, violence, internal opposition, and the concept of history by the use of this methodology. Consider Bengio on rebellion: . . . words such as intifada or thawra were used mostly with positive meanings; tamarrud (rebellion) by contrast, was nearly always used in a pejorative sense . . . tamarrada means "to rise up against legitimate authority"?an act to be utterly condemned. When the Ba'th used the term with reference to the Kurds, it did so in the most negative sense, implying treason and collaboration with the enemy .... (115-16) In every case, these explorations of the fine nuances of language are both interesting and informative, though they occasionally stray from her analysis. She also makes occasional use of wry humor, notably in her discussion of the 1991 Ba'th Party Congress of "Jihad and Construction." (188) The combination of these two elements in her work makes it a fairly pleasant read. Another strong but very brief section of this work uses discourse analysis to suggest the influence of fascist thinking on Ba'thi political culture; (125) it was disappointing that she did not include more of this kind of historical analysis, choosing instead largely to eschew the analysis of exogenous influences in favor of internal semiotics.</page><page sequence="4">186 Arab Studies Journal Fall 2000 / Spring 2001 Finally, Bengio's sources are extensive, incorporating both local and non-Iraqi Arabic-language newsmedia, Arabic primary and secondary sources, including several from Husayn himself, and a range of applicable English works. A number of weak points mar this otherwise strong work. The most prominent is the author's tendency toward a normative analysis of the discourse she studies, which often has no further explanatory relevance. This is striking in her comparison of the Prophet Muhammad and Saddam Husayn in their respective battles against the peoples of Persia (194) with the intention of discrediting the Iraqi regime's interpretation of the treaty of Hudaybiya in 628 CE, (190) and also in her discussion of Saddam's lineage. (80) Bengio's language is occasionally reductionist and somewhat anthropomorphic, notably in her discussion of a potential Palestinian state, (122) demonstrating the double fault of being overly simplistic and concealing agency. This varies throughout her work, however; the author displays both some reductionism and a nod to suitable complexity of analysis in her discussion of the incongruity of Western liberal democracy, the Arab political heritage, and Islamic values. (57) Several more minor flaws must also be mentioned. The author notes that "the use of Islamic themes was stepped-up or toned-down as circumstances seemed to require," contradicting her prior assertion that regime manipulation of Islamic discourse shaped rather than was patterned on the use of political space in Iraq. (176) She also engages the officially endorsed attack on the concept of "freedom" in Iraq, noting that to ignore it "meant to undermine the party's legitimacy,"(40) missing the original anti-imperialist, rather than civil libertarian, context of this early Ba'th rhetoric. Finally, in her discussion of Sunni Arab, Shi'i, and Kurdish identities, she notes the conflict between the Iraqi and the supranational identities, but largely ignores the salient Kurdish sub-state identity. (87) The latter is particularly marked in Iraq, where, since 1970, the Kurds have been granted a measure of quite limited regional autonomy, both officially and in practice. Ultimately, Bengio has produced a well-written and informative monograph that will assist the study of Iraq and its peculiar formulation of political discourse, but does not use its considerable insights to inform broader issues. Despite the author's occasional efforts and stated intent to " . . . [provide] a new way to understand the Ba'th's motives, policies, and ultimately its survival for almost three decades..." (vii) the reader is left with little more than discourse on discourse. Endnotes 1 Here, Bengio quotes from Ernst Cassirer's Language and Myth (1946).</page></plain_text>
