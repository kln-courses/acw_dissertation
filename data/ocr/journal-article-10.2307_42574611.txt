<plain_text><page sequence="1">KOKZYBSKI'S QUEST GERALD HASLAM * Although a target of his German only experience and Austrian with artillery gunners had on come Eastern as a target of German and Austrian gunners on Eastern European battlefields, a Polish nobleman arrived in America in 1915, nominally an artillery expert for the Imperial Russian Army. Count Alfred Korzybski, a cavalry officer forced out of combat by wounds, limped onto American soil, a tyro can- noneer, a trained mathematician, a skilled polyglot; indeed, a man whose life up to that point might well have been lifted from a Tolstoy plot. Born in Warsaw in 1879, Alfred H. S. Korzybski was the first son of a General in the Corps of Engineers. Young Korzybski was introduced to the rigors of higher math at the age of five; yet his childhood was anything but a long series of lessons. He divided his time between the family's home in Warsaw and their country estate, Korzybie, a model farm to which the United States Department of Agriculture sent observers. The thin, blonde boy was called "golden hands" and "little master" by local peasants. His education was principally accomplished at home with his father's tutoring; he read texts in German, Polish, French, Spanish, Italian, and Russian, and grew familiar with other Slavic languages. Formal schooling, however, he found less stimulating. After a period as a teacher of mathematics and physics in Warsaw, he traveled through Germany and Italy as an eclectic scholar, becoming involved in romantic affairs of the Roman court and fighting several duels. He had grown into a man of medium height with muscular shoulders on a â™¦Sonoma State College. Mr. Haslam has been a frequent con- tributor to ETC.

XXVII, NO. 1 lean frame and, what was to prove more important, a brilliant fencer. He survived his duels, giving notice in the process of the sort of boldness that would mark his controversial career as an educator and theorist in America. Returning to Poland, he managed his family's estate. Aristocrat or not, he was appalled by the squalor and ignor- ance of peasants in his country, peasants deliberately kept illiterate by the government. Young Korzybski built a school on family property, flauting tsarist law, and began teaching peasants, but government officials soon apprehended him and he was sentenced to Siberia. Only his father's considerable political influence saved him. Shortly thereafter World War I erupted and the young Count joined the Second Russian Army, serving with valor until a series of injuries and wounds led to his assignment in America. With the collapse of the Imperial Army and the revolution, he was ordered back to Russia. He refused, instead joining a French-Polish Army being formed in the U.S., where he remained for the duration of the war. Korzybski' s investigations into human evaluative mechan- ism, which led ultimately to his controversial system, "general semantics/' began at the close of the war. No attempt will be made to critically evaluate Korzybski's work in the following article; rather, his goals and actions will be presented in his own terms. The dicted closing in 1921, of the "is the world closing war," of Alfred the childhood Korzybski of pre- hu- dicted in 1921, "is the closing of the childhood of hu- manity. This childhood, as any childhood, can be characterized as devoid of any real understanding of values, as is that of a child who uses a priceless chronometer to crack nuts." 1 That humanity continues cracking nuts with a chronometer is a comment both on Korzybski's postwar optimism and on man- kind's capacity for self -reflexive delusion. Korzybski, however, quickly recognized the enormous task involved in directing human energies into cooperative, mutually beneficial activities. During the final thirty years of his life he worked at building a foundation from which people might develop a consciousness 68</page><page sequence="3">MARCH 1970 KORZYBSKl'S QUEST of their uniqueness and, in the process, open themselves to a new, more effective manner of ordering human experience. He became convinced that a new orientation must be found and implemented because the politically dominant Western European peoples had, in his view, exhausted their capacity to learn through experience ; their Aristotelian 2 metalinguistic patterns, like Euclidean or Newtonian physics, were operative only within narrow limits, and human experience had strayed into areas beyond the functional capacities of those patterns.3 Einstein's space-time theory, for example, was (and is) not readily understandable given the implicit one-dimensional flowing time and three-dimensional static space most English speakers assume is real. Yet, using predictive value as the cri- terion for truth, Einstein's space-time and relativity principles - principles which Einstein himself could not explain in any language other than mathematical symbolism - are accurate representations of physical reality. Korzybski was convinced that a new system was needed, a system capable of transcend- ing old perceptual limitations, leading to both more accurate experiential data and a better mode for applying them. "Scien- tists found long ago," he wrote in Science and Sanity, "that the common language in daily use is of little value in science. This language gives us a form of representation of very old structure in which we find it impossible to give a full, coherent account of ourselves or of the world around us." 4 General semantics, Korzybski's non-Aristotelian system, sought to pro- vide an alternate mode of evaluation based upon internalized mathematical principles which he believed would transcend the limitations of reactions governed by traditional Aristotelian structures. "... Korzybski summarized, in a few simple and highly original formulations," S. I. Hayakawa explains, . . . what he felt to be the basic assumptions underlying the habits of evaluation common to the most advanced contemporary thinkers. The modern habits of evaluation appeared to rest, he said, on three fundamental non- Aristotelian premises. Comparing the relation of language (as well as of thought, memory, mental images) to reality with the relation of maps to the territory they represent, 69</page><page sequence="4">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXVII, NO. 1 he laid down these premises : ( 1 ) a map is not the terri- tory (words are not the things they represent) ; (2) a map does not represent all of a territory (words cannot say all about anything) ; (3) a map is self -reflexive, in the sense that an ideal map would have to include a map of the map, which in turn would have to include a map of the map of the map, etc. (It is possible to speak words about words, words about words about words, etc.; in terms of behavior this means that it is possible to react to our reactions, react to our reactions to our reactions, etc.) Evaluative habits based on these premises, Korzybski said, result in flexibility of mind, lack of dogmatism, emotional balance and maturity, such as characterize the best scientific minds at least in their thought within their special fields.5 By America's the beginning involvement of World in the War struggle II - at - a Korzybski's time preceding pre- America's involvement in the struggle - Korzybski's pre- diction of a passing epoch had given way to a plea for practical measures which might help mankind gain a more accurate perspective on itself and on its actions, and to thus help it effect a passage from its cycle of self-destruction. In the American Journal of Psychiatry he wrote: "I strongly appeal to psychiatrists as specialists in 'mental' illness, and therefore uniquely competent, to cooperate as a profession in such a gigantic task of post-war educational reconstruction to save for civilization whatever there is left to save, and to build from the ruins of a dying era a new and saner society." 6 His own Institute of General Semantics was already involved in "educational reconstruction" when this appeal was made, but Korzybski's accurate appraisal of the enormous effort required for success led him to campaign evangelically for help in his crusade. He corresponded with the great minds of his time, urging repeatedly that new methods of evaluation be applied to mankind's problems. His intimate acquaintance with the excesses of a rotten government, and with the violence and disorder of its collapse, drove him ever onward in seeking preventive remedies for world problems. 70</page><page sequence="5">MARCH 1970 KORZYBSKl'S QUEST Born a nobleman during eastern Europe's most pregnant period, Korzybski observed the seeds of dynastic decay and saw their explosive maturation. His own Poland had been greedily partitioned in the eighteenth century by Prussia, Austro-Hungary and Russia. Living in Russian Poland, Kor- zybski experienced an intolerable regime; Warsaw, during his years there, was a nest of intrigue, ripe for revolution. For twenty years prior to the first world war, propaganda and agitators flooded Russian Poland from Germany and the Dual Monarchy, while guerilla leaders like Jozef Pilsudski made life miserable for tsarist officials ; government forces responded with even greater repression. Young Korzybski, himself, was arrested and later condemned to prison for "revolutionary activities" - he had educated peasants. Family connections managed to have his conviction overthrown. It is not surprising, then, that Korzybski, having lived in the growing tempest, should, like other European soldier- intellectuals, view the resulting world conflict as the culmina- tion of hundreds of years of rivalry, deceit, and ignorance, and assume that so great a conflagration must surely awaken dozing giants of potential human understanding. There is, in fact, little evidence that he erred on the above points; his naÃ¯vetÃ© evidenced itself in his failure to immediately recognize the need for specific means of evaluating new experience and implementing new insights. Only later did Korzybski note the growing number of world leaders examining recently past events with the same static patterns which, he felt, had led to the world war, thus triggering self -reflexi ve problems. Leaders continued to base their actions upon traditional orientations, completely ignoring James Harvey Robinson's suggestion that an alternative manner of both developing and holding opinions might be considered, that a radically new orientation might be possible. Korzybski worked on developing such a new operational orientation, writing Science and Sanity during the very period when post-World War I optimism flourished. Along with other acute observers, he accurately perceived world conditions during those years: 71</page><page sequence="6">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXVII, NO. 1 "The present increasing world unrest is an excellent example of this. The structure of our old languages has shaped our s.r. (semantic reactions) and suggested our doctrines, creeds, which build our institutions, customs, habits, and finally, lead fatalistically to catastrophes like the World War. We have learned long ago . . . that predictions concerning human affairs are not verified em- pirically. Our doctrines, institutions, and other disciplines are unable somehow to deal with this semantic situation, and hence the prevailing depression and pessimism." 7 Believing that the seminal problems of modern man were involved in the timebound categorizations of politically dom- inant and militarily powerful nations, he worked constantly to establish a neutral, non-emotionally loaded system to facilitate international cooperation. A letter typical of to his Karl attempts Menninger to explain during his quest. World War II was typical of his attempts to explain his quest. We speak glibly about international re-education, racial and cultural problems, etc., without realizing that the Aristotelian Indo-Europeans are today only a small minority in this world (although to a large extent in control). So we have to face endless insoluble problems and further disasters unless we Indo-Europeans investigate non-Aristotelian modern scientific orientations and methodology, which are non-racial, impersonal, f' neutral" so to say, and so may be effective in a "global" sense as a common denominator. For instance, Bertrand Russell is going back to Cambridge University. I have just written him a letter, a copy of which I enclose, to which he replied that he would consider seriously my suggestions. If we could have the cooperation of more world leaders, perhaps some constructive results could be achieved, even "in our time." 8 Korzybski not only concerned himself with the constant Aristotelian dilemmas, he also pushed hard for an awareness of racial consciousness and for its responsibility in time of massive conflict.9 That Indo-European people were involved 72</page><page sequence="7">MARCH 1970 KORZYBSKl'S QUEST in two gigantic wars in his lifetime seemed to Korzybski ample proof of a basic flaw in their logical patterns. His pro- found dedication to his newly developed alternative system, general semantics, and his growing fear of the older orienta- tion evidenced itself in a note to S. I. Hayakawa. 'In this second World War," he pointed out, "racial problems loom up so importantly that the solution of them on non-racial grounds is most important, and it has to be done on neutral grounds. I am convinced that the so-called 'white race' is extremely handicapped by the Aristotelian system, following it blindly." 10 Earlier, in a confidential report to the Guggenheim Founda- tion, he urged that Hayakawa be granted a fellowship which would allow him to prepare a book on non- Aristotelian orien- tations. "... such books are necessary today, as winning the military war is not enough. We have to win the peace, and this will require a sane attitude toward the symbols men live by." 11 His concern over the manipulation of symbols was a principal theme in a letter he sent in 1941 to a number of prominent psychiatrists and physicians. "The world crisis," he wrote, "which is unparalleled in the history of mankind, turns out ultimately to be a neurological issue. Dictatorships . . . depend on training masses in undelayed animal reflex signal reactions, although leaders reserve for themselves sym- bol reactions.12 ... A Democracy . . . should ... be based on symbol reactions, which involve evaluation." He sought aid in developing a particular system to reinforce man's ability to critically examine his environment, pointing out: "If through a method we can automatically train mankind in delayed reactions, this will turn out to be a foundation for sanity and a future better civilization." 13 The career of one particular dictator had long captured Korzybski's eye; from the publication of Mein Kampf until Hitler s destruction, Korzybski observed with growing concern the Austrian s messianic career. Sensing the coming dehuman- ization of the Nazi regime, Korzybski suggested in late 1941 that the United States seek to counter Hitler's hypnotic aura by "telling the people of Europe - who have a horror of in- 73</page><page sequence="8">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXVII, NO. 1 sanity - the authoritative verdict of American psychiatrists on Hitlers mental condition." 14 Long before evidence of death camps was exposed, he foresaw the destruction of moral restraint and the growing influence of evil which was to ulti- mately lead to attempted genocide. Korzybski believed it very important that a board of eminent psychiatrists and other experts be established to plan and guide reconstruction of the human values being ravaged in Europe by "Nazi and other evil influences." During Korzybski' the s period conviction of World that the War war was II's a deepest massive intensity, blunder Korzybski' s conviction that the war was a massive blunder precipitated by general racial misunderstanding was reinforced. His youth in anti-Semitic Poland left him deeply concerned over the "Jewish question" and he confided to his associates that only by looking beyond traditional racial grounds - grounds which Nazi murderers proved were tragically inade- quate - could a humane, intelligent easing of these historic tensions be effected. The old, emotionally supercharged assumptions denied any chance for objective examinations of the problems involved and for their possible solutions. Kor- zybski's answer was a plan for widespread reeducation. To implement his proposals, he attempted to contact important figures in science, education, and government, seeking coopera- tion in his efforts to produce a functional plan. To Merton M. Gill, Menninger Clinic: ... It is not generally realized that historically speak- ing super-imposition of Aristotelianism on Judaism re- sulted in so-called "Christianity" . . . We are living in a world chaos in which the racial and interracial mutual understanding looms up as one of the most important problems. The Indo-European Aristotelians are a marked minority in the world, and yet they are to a large extent in control. It is predictable that if the Aristotelians do not alter their premises, attitudes, etc., and in general 74</page><page sequence="9">MARCH 1970 KORZYBSKl'S QUEST become more scientific, 1944, and therefore non- Aris- totelian, nothing but further conflicts can be expected. Scientists, which includes psychiatrists, should be aware that we are living in a period of passing, unavoidably and irrevocably, from the anthropomorphic, antiquated, 'ob- jective/ two-valued, Aristotelian orientations to the infin- ite-valued, modern, scientific, process non-Aristotelian orientations.15 To Dr. Jekuthiel Ginsburg, Scripta Mathematica: . . . There is little doubt that the latest human disasters were due to the depraved Aristotelianism, and the messes we are drifting into now have the same origin and cannot be helped by the old methods. Mathematics has a glorious history. However, nobody has done that necessary non- Aristotelian synthesis as a new system applicable to chil- dren, and of course even to adults. Many books such as Keyses's, have been published, but even these momentous volumes, without which my non- Aristotelian work could not progress, are not applied. In our work we are amazed at the amount of knowledge which is extant and the tragic lack of application. Briefly it is due to the paralyzing effect of the old systems and the lack of a new system which would apply to science as well as life. 1) Many mathematical difficulties were and are due to linguistic difficulties. 2) Linguistic difficulties (extreme) are due to the neglect of applying mathematical discoveries to linguistic advance. 3) Mathematical positional notation of numbers is ad- mittedly the greatest achievement which made modern science and mathematics possible, and this is due to the structure of Semitic languages, which with the Chinese structure of language and mathematical con- tributions influenced largely the Hindus. But of course the positional notation once being discovered and the benefits evaluated, the rest was rather simple in the course of millenniums. 75</page><page sequence="10">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXVII, NO. 1 I know from experience how all these subjects are inter- woven and fascinating even to people with elementary algebra, or in fact to people with less than that knowl- edge. I lectured for instance to the University of Cali- fornia in Berkeley, supposedly to the English Department with something like say 50 students expected. Well, 500 crowded the hall and all standing and even sitting places on the floor, and 100 had to be turned away from the door. The audience was so mixed with old and young that I did not look at them as it would spoil my lecture. The audience was unexpectedly most enthusiastic; I was not, as I had only one hour in which I could not make good with the professionals who were also present. The medical men responded as usual warmly, as they have their own difficulties similar to those of the Einstein theory in the past. A little hyphen which changes radically the structure of language does it, in this instance psycho- somatic medicine.16 There toward were Korzybski's some glimmers goal of general of hope, reorientation: some tentative a moves senate toward Korzybski's goal of general reorientation: a senate committee for naval affairs convened in 1945 considering a bill promoting scientific research, which suggested that a thor- ough study be made of "the new non- Aristotelian method- ology" before a final decision was made with respect to formulating a national policy for scientific research and edu- cation. It was understood, the bill stated, that the new non- Aristotelian methodology was especially applicable to the scientific study of the social sciences. Such positive responses were, unfortunately, few. Although his seminars and lectures were attracting ever-increasing enrollment, Korzybski's at- tempts to stimulate a program for general reorientation con- tinued to be half perceived and conveniently ignored by indi- viduals and institutions powerful enough to support so grand a plan. On a less broad, though equally wise and compassionate scale, Korzybski's insights were successfully applied to correct "war mentality." Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, Consultant in Psy- chiatry for the European Theatre of Operations, Chief Thera- 76</page><page sequence="11">MARCH 1970 KORZYBSKl'S QUEST peutic Research Consultant in War Neurosis, and later Chief Psychiatrist at the Nuremberg War Crime Trials, found that in a great many instances the problems of soldiers were not medical in character; rather, some G.I. 's were unable to think in terms of facts, constantly confusing creeds, dogmas, wishes and dreams with actual experience. Kelley, after some remark- able success with Korzy bskian techniques, trained less experi- enced psychiatrists in general extensionalization. "Korzybski has attacked a problem which so far has been generally ignored by most therapists," Kelley wrote. "War produces a series of situational stresses which result in the development of pro- found changes in an individual's psychosomatic structures. . . . No human being can conceive of a more adequate mechanism for twisting human emotion and for developing organismal responses to specific stimuli than is achieved in an active battle zone." 17 Korzybski had noted that "what should be avoided are second order reactions, such as fear of fear, nervousness about nervousness , worry about worry, etc., which may seriously aggravate the original normal reactions under abnormal con- ditions." 18 Commenting on the very patterns Korzybski pointed out, Kelley claimed "General semantics, as a modern scientific method, offers techniques which are of extreme value both in the prevention and cure of such reactive patterns. . . . These principles were applied (as individual therapies and as group therapies) at every treatment level from the forward area to the rearmost echelon, in frontline aid stations, in ex- haustion centers and in general hospitals. That they were employed with success is demonstrated by the fact that psychi- atric evacuations from the European Theatre were held to a minimum." 10 "It is a melancholy reflection," Korzybski wrote to Dr. Harry Stack Sullivan in 1946, "that it took a second world war to make psychiatrists realize the entirely general benefits of neutral non-medical training in evaluating in terms of exten- sional 'facts' instead of definitions (intension) overloaded with antiquated dogmas and creeds, etc." 20 But as the Second World War ended, a new force threat- ened international stability, a force built upon rigid two-valued 77</page><page sequence="12">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXVU, NO. 1 philosophical concepts: communism. The so-called free world arose to meet communism's intensified challenge, and the self- reflexive dilemmas which had so lately overwhelmed civiliza- tion began once more their apparently inexorable cycle, ignor- ing Albert Einstein's warning: "Unleashed power of the atom has changed everything except our modes of thinking, and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe." 21 When Korzybski died in 1950, still working to clear the international morass of destructive evaluative systems, the Korean conflict bloodied an already war-weary world. Like a reluctant youth - grown strong beyond his own realization, yet not possessing wisdom to match his strength - humanity once more managed to prolong its childhood. References 1.

The term Aristotelian as used by Korzybski can be trans- lated 'Indo-European' for most purposes, the name of Aristotle being used largely because he was, and remains, foremost in making explicit the structural implications un- derlying our common Western linguistic heritage, and fore- most also in introducing order into Western thought.
