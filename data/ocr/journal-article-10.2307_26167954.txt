<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Ethics and Natural History: Levinas and Other-Than-Human Animals Christian Diehm Christian Diehm is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point,  where he serves as coordinator of the undergraduate environmental ethics program.  He teaches courses  in environmental philosophy and related areas, and his most recent research has been on deep ecological  notions of “identification” with nature and ecofeminist attempts to develop ecologically inspired forms  of materialism. This essay questions the place of other-than-human animals in Levinas’s thought.  After detailing how  animals and animality figure in Levinas’s work, it is claimed that his ethical exclusion of animals is due  to a conception of animals as wholly accountable for in terms of species-being, wholly within “natural  history.”  It is then suggested that Levinas’s position is ill-founded, and at odds with his claims about the  importance of suffering and the vulnerable body in the encounter with the other.  The essay concludes by  arguing that speaking of other-than-human animal “faces” is not necessarily an unduly anthropocentric  extension of thinking-of-the-other.  In the editors’ introduction to Animal Philosophy, Peter Atterton and Matthew Calarco note  that, for the most part, “Continental philosophy has lagged behind its Anglo-American neighbor” in  addressing the question of the moral status of other-than-human animals, or “the animal question.”1   In the preface to the same volume, this point is expressed rather more sharply by well-known animal  ethicist Peter Singer.  After mentioning the tremendous advancements that philosophers have made  over the past several decades in re-thinking the place of animals in ethics, Singer asks, “How much of  this philosophical impetus that gave rise to a practical challenge to the way we think about nonhuman  animals came from writers in the philosophical traditions of Continental Europe, from such thinkers as  Heidegger, Foucault, Levinas, and Deleuze, or those who take the work of these thinkers as setting a  framework for their own thought?”  Unfortunately, Singer finds that the answer to this question is, quite  simply, “none.”2 For Singer, that Continental philosophers have yet to address such a pressing moral problem  raises a basic question, which is why this is the case, or in his words, “why such an extensive body of  thought should have failed to grapple with the issue of how we treat animals.”3  Of course, for some  central figures in the Continental tradition, an adequate reply to this query would have to take into  consideration the fact that discussions of ethics—inter-human or otherwise—were never of central  importance to them.  However, that Emmanuel Levinas could be cited as a thinker who failed to re- consider our relations with other-than-human animals is significantly more damning, since he, above  all, made it his business to interrogate the ethical, and by many accounts radically so.  But is such a  portrayal of Levinas accurate?  For all his ground-breaking and original ethical thinking, did Levinas  really fail on “the animal question”?  And, perhaps more importantly, if he did so fail, then why?   Animal Faces? To ask the first of the above questions is tantamount to asking whether or not Levinas believes  that animals have a “face.”  His most explicit comments on this subject are found in the interview “The  Paradox of Morality,” where he is asked several questions about the place of animals in his thinking.4   For the most part, his remarks reveal a desire to reserve a privileged position for the human face.  At one  point his interlocutors ask if there is something about the human face that distinguishes it from that of an  3  </page> <page sequence="2"> Fall 200  ETHICS AND NATURAL HISTORY 3  animal, to which Levinas replies that one “cannot entirely refuse the face of an animal,” but “the priority  here is not found in the animal, but in the human face.”5  This thought is repeated a short while later,  when he claims that “the human face is completely different and only afterwards do we discover the face  of the animal,” such that human ethics serves as the “prototype” of any ethical relation that may arise  between humans and other-than-human animals.6 Yet even while attributing secondary status to animals, Levinas leaves open the possibility of  encountering them as other ethically.  He claims, for example, that we do not find the “purest form” of  the face in an animal, but that it “also has a face.”7  In a comment that can be taken both as an indication  of Levinas’s willingness to consider questions of animal faces, and as a sign of his own failure to take  such questions very seriously, he says “I don’t know if a snake has a face.  I can’t answer that question.   A more specific analysis is needed.”8 Such uncertainty about animal faces, however, runs counter to most of Levinas’s work,  which would appear to have decided the issue of animals and ethics fairly early on.  “Is Ontology  Fundamental?,” first published in 1951, argued that the only being able to express as the face is the other  human, and in doing so relied on negative comparisons to nature and other-than-human animals.  “I can  kill the way I hunt,” we read, “or cut down trees, or slaughter animals . . .”; but in treating the human  other in these ways “I have not looked him in the face.”9  Continuing this line of thinking, Totality and  Infinity stressed that only a being who is radically other can issue the call to responsibility, and said that  “it is only man who could be absolutely foreign to me.”10  Coming full circle, Otherwise Than Being  returned to the contrast between encountering humans and encountering animals, stating in a discussion  of the “trace” of the face that “the infinite . . . cannot be tracked down like game by a hunter.”11 The radical difference between human and animal others that these statements suggest is  clearly marked in comments that Levinas makes in praise of the philosophy of Rene Descartes.  In God,  Death and Time, he claims that Descartes’s notion of the rational soul, which Descartes mistakenly took  to be a substance, is “described phenomenologically as a face,”12 and in “Language and Proximity” he  applauds the fifth part of the Discourse on Method, in which Descartes denied that animals had such  rational souls since they could not provide evidence to the contrary—they could not speak.  For Levinas,  the point is that, if animals were capable of the ethical expressivity of the face, we surely would know it,  despite the fact that they differ from us physically and cannot speak a familiar language.  “Language,”  he says, “is the possibility of entering into relationship independently of every system of signs common  to the interlocutors.  Like a battering-ram, it is the power to break through the limits of culture, body,  and race.”  Following Descartes, however, Levinas maintains that animals lack this power to breach  borders and enter into the ethical relationship.  The animal is trapped in “the particularisms of a species”;  it is “imprisoned in its constitution.”  Consequently, the animal is “a machine,” a being that never leaves  a trace but only a track or a trail, something that one tracks down like a detective—or a hunter.13 It is legitimate to ask, though, why Levinas sides with Descartes on this point.  Descartes, as  is well known, took language to be an external indication of internal thought, and therefore argued that  the fact that animals do not speak was evidence that they lacked a rational soul.  Levinas, however, has  a very different conception of language.  When asked in “The Paradox of Morality” if one must have the  potential for language to express as the face, he replies that language “does not begin with the signs that  one gives, with words.  Language is above all the fact of being addressed . . . which means the saying  much more than the said.”14  But if this is the case, if language is fundamentally an event of ethical  address and not of speech, then Levinas’s assertion that animals lack (ethical) language amounts to no  more than the tautology that animals do not address us because in our encounter with them the ethical  address is not voiced.  Or, in simpler terms, animals do not face us because they do not have faces. This highlights an important point, namely that Levinas’s marginalization of animals often  appears to be the product of an uncritically assumed anthropocentrism, and not rigorous analysis.15  But  Levinas does have his reasons for denying the ethical expressivity of other-than-human animals.  The  clue lies, I think, in his claim that animals are “imprisoned in their constitution,” and to understand  </page> <page sequence="3"> 3  ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY Vol. 3 what this means we must follow a path other than the one which leads through Descartes to language.   Instead, we must take a route that leads through Darwin to Levinas’s philosophical biology.16 The Animal and the Ethical Levinas never developed a complete philosophy of nature, and it is arguable that his  philosophical biology is even less well developed.17  It is in Totality and Infinity, though, that we get the  most comprehensive account of his views on nature and other-than-human organisms, an account that  is supplemented by sporadic comments made in other texts.  For Levinas, the most basic trait of living  beings is that they depend upon their surrounding environments to live: every living thing draws its  sustenance and strength from something other than itself; every life is a “life  from . . .” something else.  He draws a rough distinction, however, between the form that this  dependence takes in animals and in plants.  “Animal need,” he writes, “is liberated from vegetable  dependence . . . ”18 indicating that, whereas plants simply depend upon the immediate presence of the  things they require to live, animals’ sensory and motor capacities allow them to pursue objects of need  through both space and time.  Liberated from the requirement that they be physically contiguous with  the stuff necessary for life, animals exist at a distance from the world upon which they depend.   Yet the distance between animals and what they need is a space that constantly must be  traversed, an obstacle that animals must forever strain to overcome.  “An animal’s need,” Levinas  says, “is inseparable from struggle and fear; the exterior world from which it is liberated remains a  threat.”19  The “threat” mentioned here is the possibility that need might go unmet, the fact that existence  is shadowed by non-existence, and for Levinas animal existence is wholly given over to the struggle  against this enduring menace.  This idea is emphasized consistently in Levinas’s writing, which often  repeats the Darwinian emphasis on struggle as definitive of animal life.  As early as Existence and  Existents, in fact, Levinas acknowledged Darwin’s influence on philosophy, writing that nineteenth  century biology’s “new and fundamental idea,” the idea that has acquired “primacy” in the interpretation  of life, is that the relation between existents and their existence is “the very struggle for life.”20  In “The  Paradox of Morality” he reiterates this point, stating that “[a] being is something that is attached to  being, to its own being.  That is Darwin’s idea.  The being of animals is a struggle for life.”21  According  to Levinas, therefore, the aim of animal existence is existence itself, its prolongation in the future; every  effort of the animal is an effort to survive and hence the very being of animals is a struggle to continue  to be.  The characterization of animals as perpetually engaged in the struggle for existence plays a  number of roles in Levinas’s thought.  First, it serves as a description of the mode of being of other- than-human animals.  But Levinas also moves from this account of particular, concrete animal others to  arrive at a general conception of animality as an expression of what he frequently calls, borrowing from  the tradition, the conatus essendi: the perseverance in being, the striving for oneself.22  To be animal in  this sense is to belong to the order of being, the ontological order in which all being is being-for-itself.   Hence, all living things can be described as “animal” insofar as they are all, on some level, engaged  in a mode of existence in which existence centers on itself, on self-preservation.  And recognizing  this explains not only why Levinas refers to the “animal condition” of human life and the “animal  complacency” of human enjoyment,23 but also why he uses examples from the plant kingdom to describe  the egoism of animality, which is said to be like a “tree that grows without regard for everything it  suppresses and breaks, grabbing all the nourishment, air and sun, a being that is fully justified in its  nature and its being.”24  This account of animality as being-for-itself forms a familiar contrast with Levinas’s  conception of what is distinctively human as being-for-the-other.  While the being of animals, and  indeed all living things, is a “struggle for life without ethics,” it is Levinas’s contention that humans  are called by the other to transcend the egoism of the animal order.  “Man is an unreasonable animal,”  he says, since “with the appearance of the human . . . there is something more important than my  </page> <page sequence="4"> Fall 200  ETHICS AND NATURAL HISTORY 3  own life, and that is the life of the other.” Such transcendence is, as Levinas sees it, a genuine break  from the animal condition, and not merely a new name for an old game.  Contesting the work of those  sociobiologists who view altruistic behavior as an expression of genetic selfishness, Levinas argues that  the “thesis that the ethical is biological amounts to saying that . . . the human is only the last stage in  the evolution of the animal.  I would say, on the contrary, that in relation to the animal the human is a  new phenomenon.”25  This “new phenomenon” is the utterly novel appearance of a being whose being  is otherwise than being-for-itself, a being divested of the perseverance in being—the rupture of being in  the human. Animals and Human Animals The division between animality and humanity, between the animal and the ethical, is well- known amongst Levinas’s readers.  It is sometimes forgotten, though, that Levinas makes another  distinction between animals and humans, one that ultimately is more fundamental to understanding the  place he accords to animals in his ethical philosophy.  Despite the animality of human egoism, Levinas is unambiguous in his desire to dissociate  human and other-than-human animals.  He finds that there is in human beings an “inversion of the  instincts of nutrition, which have lost their biological finality,” an inversion which “marks the very  disinterestedness of man.”26  “Instinctive behavior,” as the term is used here, is activity that functions  to promote the basic biological interests of a being; it is tied to biological ends, a “biological finality.”   Hence in claiming that humans are “disinterested” here, Levinas is not referring to the dis-interestedness  of ethics.  He is instead describing the form that the conatus assumes in human beings, the particular  way in which need is lived by human existents.  For Levinas, humans relate to what they need sincerely,  outside of the question of their continued existence and outside of any interest in simply remaining alive.  In short, in Levinas’s philosophical biology, human beings stand well outside the biological order of  things.   For the human existent, therefore, life “is not the naked will to be, an ontological Sorge for  this life,” but is instead a “love of life,” an enjoyment of the things which are needed.27  “To enjoy  without utility,” Levinas writes, “in pure loss, gratuitously, without referring to anything else, in pure  expenditure—this is the human.”28  Hence there is in the human an inversion of the biological order  prior to the inversion that takes place in ethics; there is a “gap between the animal and the human”29  different from that which delimits the ontological and the ethical.  Indeed it is an inversion presupposed  by Levinas’s ethics, one in which the individual separates from the species and stands outside the  totality.  “There is,” we are told, “a non-systematic accumulation of occupations and tastes, equidistant  from the system of reason, where the encounter with the Other opens the infinite, and from the system  of instinct, anterior to separated being, anterior to the being veritably born, separated from its cause,  nature.”30  Beyond the biological “system of instinct” yet before the ethical “system of reason,” the  human exists as separated, unlike other Homo sapiens in its idiosyncratic “occupations and tastes,”  unique.  Consequently, human animality is improperly described in terms of species-being.  In human  beings, need gives rise to something other than a biologically driven and species-wide responsiveness  to stimuli; it is the opening of a personal perspective on the world, the appearance of a unique “point  of view” on things.  Such uniqueness, of course, is at the heart of Levinas’s thinking-of-the-other.   “The unique,” he says, “is the other in an eminent way: he doesn’t belong to a genus or doesn’t remain  within his genus.”31  Thus the ethical relationship “goes to the unassimilable, incomparable other, to  the irreducible other, the unique other.”32  Other-than-human animals, however, lack such incomparable  singularity.  For them, life takes place as an instinctive impulse towards living that, rather than being an  inaugural moment of individuality, serves instead to situate them within the totality of a species.  This  is what Levinas indicates when he says in “Language and Proximity” that animals are “imprisoned in  their constitution.”  For him, animal need never gives rise to the individual: animals of the same kind are  </page> <page sequence="5"> 3  ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY Vol. 3 caught up in the same instinctive striving, in identical ways of being.  Animals are never “one of a kind,”  but only one-of-a-multitude-of-their-kind.33 This view of animal existence as “generic”—or, in biological terms, “specific”—is  complemented by Levinas’s understanding of other-than-human life as wholly inscribed in natural  history, which he reads as the story of natural kinds and not of individual organisms.  In a short section  of part II of Totality and Infinity tellingly entitled “The I of Enjoyment is Neither Biological Nor  Sociological,” he takes pains to distinguish his view of the human existent from “the notion of the  person as it is fabricated by the philosophy of life or of race.”  “In the exaltation of biological life,” he  writes, “the person arises as a product of the species or of impersonal life, which has recourse to the  individual so as to ensure its impersonal triumph.”  In this way of thinking, “[t]he unicity of the I, its  status as a conceptless individual, would disappear in this participation in what exceeds it.”  These  remarks include a footnote about “racist” thought that views the individual as being “at the service of  life and of the creation of life.”34  This, however, is precisely the picture that Levinas paints of other- than-human life: the whole effort of the other-than-human being is aimed at persisting in being, and thus  this participation in life is the whole of its being.  The “logic of life” (bio-logos) is that living beings eat  to live, and presumably live to reproduce their kind, and thus are wholly given over to the species, where  individual organisms are simply the playthings of a creative process that precedes and outstrips them.  In  nature there are no proper names, only the blind, impersonal fecundity of the Earth. We are now in a position to comprehend more fully Levinas’s remarks on animals and ethics  in “The Paradox of Morality.”  In several of his statements he focuses on dogs, and although he waivers  on the question of their having faces, it is clear that in the final analysis he wishes to describe them  otherwise.  “In the dog,” he says, “there are other phenomena.  For example, the force of nature is pure  vitality.  It is more this which characterizes the dog.”35  A short while later he returns to consider the dog,  claiming that in a dog, “what we like is his child-like character.  As if he were strong, cheerful, powerful,  full of life.”36  Both of these statements make appeals to an animal’s vitality and strength, the verve and  vigor of the living being, all of which are aspects of “the force of nature.”  Other-than-human animals  (and indeed all other-than-human living beings) are, for Levinas, first and foremost expressions of life,  of the incessant creative force that pulses through generations, and here, as before, this belonging to the  creative process—indeed being nothing (or next to nothing) more than an expression of it—erases or  distorts the face, effacing ethics just as surely as it erases the individual. Proper Names Thus there is in Levinas’s work an intricate thinking-of-the-other-than-human animal, forged  in the context of an attempt to conceive of the human as a break from the animal condition.  This  break, as we have seen, takes place as a double-exclusion of the animal, but one which nevertheless  retains a certain continuity with it.  As individual existents, humans break from the biological finality  of instinct-driven animal life, and yet, as called to be for-the-other, humans remain animal enough for  ethics to appear as a summons to rise above the naïve will-to-live of animal existence.  And this means  that humans are just animal enough for the advent of the other human to appear as shock and rupture of  the conatus essendi, but not so animal as to be accountable to animals (and others) who are other-than- human. These last remarks help us to appreciate the depth of Levinas’s conceptual instrumentalization  of the animal.  They also raise some very serious questions.  Most important is the question of whether  or not the distinctions that he wants to draw so sharply do not begin to blur at a certain point.  He  acknowledges that the conatus persists throughout the living world, but insists that in the human existent  it is expressed completely differently than in any other living thing, that only in the human does need  take shape as an irreplaceable perspective on the world.  The best phenomenological evidence, however,  points in the opposite direction, as those who live and work closely with other-than-human animals  nearly always report individual differences between members of the same species, and frequently regard  </page> <page sequence="6"> Fall 200  ETHICS AND NATURAL HISTORY 3  attention to these differences as indispensable to their dealings with them.37  Would the “more specific  analysis” that Levinas admits is lacking in his work be able to catch sight of this?38 This question becomes all the more pressing when we underscore Levinas’s own emphasis  on the suffering body as the locus of the call to responsibility for the other.  Ethics for Levinas is not  a function of our belonging to a kingdom of rational ends; it is a function of our incarnation, our own  exposure to the exposure and vulnerability of the flesh of the other.  This is why he writes in Totality and  Infinity that “the whole body—a hand or a curve of the shoulder—can express as the face,”39 and why, in  “Useless Suffering,” he claims that “attention to the suffering of the other” can be “raised to the level of  the supreme ethical principle.”40 What, then, are we to say of animals?  To claim, as Levinas does, that the being of animals  is a struggle to be, is to say that the being of animals is defined by need, driven by the hunger that  is common to all incarnate being; it is to say that the flesh of the animal is no less vulnerable, no  less exposed, than the flesh of every other other, human or otherwise.  Is such exposure simply a tax  carelessly levied by an impersonal fecundity, the price that Life (with a capital “L”) thoughtlessly pays  in its incessant march toward more diverse kinds?  Or should we say instead, without denying natural  history, that the exposure of other-than-human beings is always already individuated (or individuating),  always the exposure of this one?  Is not a being that needs always an exception to anonymous being and  deserving of a proper name, a being that is always capable of facing us?  And could this be what Levinas  means when he says that his notion of the face is “a certain way of expressing what I mean when I speak  of the conatus essendi, the effort to exist which is the ontological principle”?41 In positing such continuity between humans and other-than-human animals, we are not  arbitrarily assuming that human others serve as a standard of who is other ethically, and then searching  to find ways in which other-than-human others might conform to that standard.  Concerned that  approaches to environmental philosophy that would take Levinas’s work as a starting point might  employ this strategy, Edward S. Casey cautions against reading the embodiment of others, or of nature  in general, in terms of the face, saying that this strategy “entails the fatal flaw of anthropocentrism.”   “To generalize the human body,” Casey writes, “starting with its peculiar face, over the entire  environment is only to indulge in an unremitting extension of humanism, making man indeed ‘the  measure of all things’.”42  Thus, while Casey acknowledges that the central task of a Levinasian  environmentalism would be to find “the equivalent of the face in the environing world,”43 he argues that  the characterization of nature’s face should “not borrow any of its basic traits from human beings.”44 It would be much too hasty, however, to say without qualification that seeing other-than- human animals (and others) as expressing the naked vulnerability of the face involves an untenable  anthropocentrism.45  It is true, of course, that we do not want to be so human-centered that we recognize  the signifyingness only of others who are human-like, but it is no less true that we do not want to be  so human-centered that we refuse to recognize certain truths about other-than-human animals even  when they are quite obvious.  More specifically, while we must be careful about the potential human  bias of a viewpoint that centers on the acknowledgment of other-than-human faces, a viewpoint that  rejects outright the possibility that other-than-human beings might claim us in the manner characteristic  of the face is equally, if not more, biased in favor of the human.  That we would consider the ethical  expressivity of the flesh to be “human,” and then refer to views that read such expressivity in the  flesh of what is other-than-human as “anthropocentric” or “anthropomorphic,” is the height of human  prejudice.46  There is nothing “secondary” or “derivative” about the naked vulnerability of other-than- human animals.  I encounter it first-hand every time I meet them in the flesh.  Not surprisingly, Levinas  seems to think otherwise.  Although he recognizes that many people find their relations to animals to  be ethically significant, he apparently believes that this significance is parasitic on the relation to the  human other.  A practice such as vegetarianism, he says, “arises from the transference to animals of  the idea of suffering.”47  Against this, we should say that this account does not adequately describe  </page> <page sequence="7">  0 ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY Vol. 3 our responsiveness to animal others.  As philosopher and animal activist Brian Luke explains his own  objections to animal exploitation, My opposition to the institutionalized exploitation of animals is not based on a comparison  between human and animal treatment, but on a consideration of the abuse of the animals in  and of itself.   I respond directly to the needs and the plight of the animals used in hunting,  farming, and vivisection.  In objecting to these practices I am not comparing the treatment  of humans and animals, and thinking “this is unfair because humans are protected from such  usage.”  I am appalled by these abuses themselves....48 With Luke, then, we would be more accurate to assert that our responsiveness to other-than-human  animals does not require that we transfer to them some conception of the significance of suffering that  relies on their being compared to human others.49  An other-than-human animal’s face is not an analogue  of the face of another human; it signifies as the face on its own.  It is the immediate presence of the  singular need, the singular exposure and weakness, of every other who meets me in the flesh Endnotes: 1 Peter Atterton and Matthew Calarco, eds., Animal Philosophy: Ethics and Identity (London:  Continuum, 2004), xvi. 2 Peter Singer, preface to Animal Philosophy: Ethics and Identity, xii. 3 Ibid. 4 A number of thinkers have taken up with Levinas’s comments about animals in this interview.

This same point is made by David  Wood, who claims that “[w]e know that Levinas takes for granted some sort of connection between face  and language . . .” (“Thinking with Cats,” in Animal Philosophy: Ethics and Identity, 132).  While this  captures what seems to be the general spirit of Levinas’s thinking, I now believe it to be more correct to  say that Levinas denies other-than-human others the expressivity of the face not because of their lack of  linguistic abilities, but because of what he believes is their “generic” being.  This is the line of thinking  that I am developing in the ensuing sections of this paper. 17 See Adriaan Peperzak, Beyond: The Philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas (Evanston: Northwestern  University Press, 1997), 193-203. 18 Levinas, Totality and Infinity, 116. 19 Ibid. 20 Emmanuel Levinas, Existence and Existents, trans.

In this same text, Levinas also describes such self-centered  existence as a “wild vegetation that absorbs or breaks or pushes back everything around it” (9). 25 Wright et al., “The Paradox of Morality,” 172. 26 Levinas, Totality and Infinity, 134. 27 Ibid., 112. 28 Ibid., 133. 29 Ibid., 149. 30 Ibid., 133-4. 31 Levinas, Entre Nous, 205.  It is worth mentioning here that Levinas often thinks of “unicity” as the  singularity of the one who is responsible for the other.  The sense of uniqueness we are discussing here,  though, is the irreducible singularity of the other announced in the face.  In the interview in which this  comment is found, Levinas is responding to a question about the incomparability of the face, and begins  his reply by saying, “When I speak of uniqueness, I am also expressing the otherness of the other.” 32 Ibid., 194. 33 There is a parallel between this viewpoint and the belief that modern animal agri-business is justified  because any animal killed is replaced by another of the same kind that the industry brings into existence.  This argument is premised on the absolute interchangeability of animal others, on the idea that an  animal is no more than a replication of a species-type and, as such, is entirely replaceable.  Far from  being an irretrievable loss, the absence of any one animal is made good by the presence of any other.   For discussion of this issue, sometimes referred to as the “replaceability argument,” see Peter Singer,  Practical Ethics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 119 ff. 34 Levinas, Totality and Infinity, 120. 35 Wright et al., “The Paradox of Morality,” 169. 36 Ibid., 172. 37 In addition to the myriad anecdotal expressions of this point that many of us have encountered, it  </page> <page sequence="9">  2 ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY Vol. 3 has been expressed in various forms of literature.  One of the most well-known examples is the work  of Jane Goodall, who does not hesitate to speak of the animals with whom she has worked as distinct  individuals (see The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior [Cambridge: Belknap Press, 1996],  especially chapter 4, “Who’s Who”).  On the basis of his contact and conversations with ranchers and  farmers, Bernard E. Rollin makes the same claim about domesticated animals in The Unheeded Cry:  Animal Consciousness, Animal Pain, and Science (Ames: Iowa University Press, 1998), 30-1.  The  work of Donald R. Griffin is relevant here as well, as he indicates that some other-than-human animals  seem to be able to recognize each other as distinct individuals (see Animal Minds: Beyond Cognition to  Consciousness [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001], chapter 12).  For an early argument to this  effect, see F. J. J. Buytendijk, Pain: Its Modes and Functions (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,  1961). 38 This shows us that the “blurring” of distinctions that we are discussing is not a way of eradicating  differences but rather multiplying them, by acknowledging the non-homogenous character of animals’  lives.  Animal life is not an undifferentiated foil to the diverse character of human existence, it is a  heterogeneous multitude of kinds and individual ways of being.  I take this to be one of the central  theses of Jacques Derrida’s work on animals and animality, most notably “The Animal That Therefore  I am (More to Follow),” trans. David Wills, Critical Inquiry 28, 2 (2002): 369-418 (reprinted in Animal  Philosophy: Ethics and Identity, 113-28).  Though he shows a characteristic resistance to speaking of  human-animal continuity, he does so because he does not want to collapse the categories of “human”  and “animal” (which already distort or obscure singularity, especially in the case of other-than-human  beings) into an even more encompassing, homogeneous totality that would be inclusive of both.  Instead,  he seeks to multiply differences by recognizing, in the first place, the singularity and plurality of others  with whom we “humans” exist.  As he expresses it: We have to envisage the existence of “living creatures” whose plurality cannot be assembled  within the single feature of an animality that is simply opposed to humanity.  This does not of  course mean ignoring or effacing everything that separates humankind from the other animals,  creating a single large set, a single great, fundamentally homogeneous and continuous family  tree....  I repeat that it is rather a matter of taking into account a multiplicity of heterogeneous  structures and limits. Among nonhumans and separate from nonhumans there is an immense  multiplicity of other living things that cannot in any way be homogenized, except by means of  violence and willful ignorance, within the category of what is called the animal or animality in  general [cited in Animal Philosophy: Ethics and Identity, 125-6]. 39 Levinas, Totality and Infinity, 262. 40 Levinas, Entre Nous, 94.  In other essays I have developed this reading of Levinas at greater length,  and tried to show how it is relevant to an ethic that recognizes other-than-human beings (see “Facing  Nature”; “Natural Disasters”). 41 Wright et al., “The Paradox of Morality,” 173. 42 Edward S. Casey, “Taking a Glance at the Environment: Preliminary Thoughts on a Promising Topic,”  in Eco-Phenomenology, Back to the Earth Itself , 193. 43 Ibid., 192. 44 Ibid., 194. 45 This is not to accuse Casey, or others who make similar points, of being simplistic.  In his essay,  Casey is more concerned with the question of whether or not nature-at-large, or “the environment,” has  a face, and hence he is particularly worried about too quickly grafting Levinas’s account of the other  onto his reflections on nature.  However, I believe the situation may be different with other-than-human  animals, which I explain in what follows. 46 In addition to concern about the anthropocentrism of employing human criteria to describe ethically  </page> <page sequence="10"> Fall 200  ETHICS AND NATURAL HISTORY  3 significant others, some authors worry (rightly) that this strategy remains exclusive of a great many  other beings.  While my intention in this essay is to expose some of the biases that keep Levinas from  recognizing animal others, and to indicate how, on this point, one might be able to read Levinas “against  himself,” so to speak, I believe that it is true that Levinas’s thought, even when pushed to its outermost  ecological limits, has trouble accommodating certain entities that some environmental philosophers want  to take into account.  Levinas’s work can, however, be taken further than an “animal ethic” (see “Facing  Nature” and “Natural Disasters”).  For a discussion of the limits of a Levinasian environmentalism, see  my “Gaia and Il y a: Reflections on the Face of the Earth,” Symposium 7, 2 (2003): 173-83. 47 Wright et al., “The Paradox of Morality,” 172. 48 Brian Luke, “Justice, Caring, and Animal Liberation,” in Beyond Animal Rights: A Feminist Caring  Ethic for the Treatment of Animals, ed. Josephine Donovan and Carol J. Adams (New York: Continuum,  1996), 81. 49 Levinas’s claim about “transference” in this context is interesting, as it is open to more than one  interpretation.  If it is taken to mean that we can understand the suffering of animals only by comparison  to other human beings, then, as I am arguing here (with Luke), I believe he is completely mistaken.   If, on the other hand, he is arguing that understanding the suffering of animals requires some sort of  analogy or comparison to ourselves, then I would be more likely to agree, with the qualification that  the same would seem to be true of our relations with other humans, something which could call into  question the whole edifice of Levinas’s ethics, and which is beyond the scope of this paper. </page> </plain_text>
