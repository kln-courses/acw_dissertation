CHO, AND INGMAR RIEDEL-KRUSE Microbes and sometimes more complex living things can be turned into pieces in games that, though they may have educational purposes, may also just be played for fun. Should we be troubled? In laboratory application 2011, Ingmar at that Stanford uses Riedel-Kruses paramecia University for bioengineering publicized what the re- an laboratory at Stanford University publicized an application that uses paramecia for what the re- searchers termed "biotic games." These games make use of living organisms, computer programs, and lab equipment to implement games like Pong, Pac-man, and soccer. Several media outlets covered the labs work, which resulted in discussion online; the re- sponse was mixed, and the intensity of statements of opposition prompted Riedel-Kruse to engage with bioethicists in order to evaluate these objections and obtain guidance for future work, which led to this jointly authored analysis. Biotechnology is advancing at such a pace that we can expect a variety of commercial, academic, and Hayden Harvey, Molly Havard, David Magnus, Mildred K. Cho, and Ingmar H.

DOI: 10.1002/hast.386 educational uses of technology that make increas- ingly radical alterations of organic matter and living things. The use of living things in "games" enabled by biotechnology is a special case, as "games," "en- tertainment," "play," and related activities are often considered nonserious or trivial, whereas life, biolog- ical systems, and science are treated very seriously in moral analysis and public perception. The manipu- lation of living matter frequently engenders at least some controversy in the marketplace of ideas, and using living things in games is no exception. Some of the objections lodged against biotic games have appeared in the ethics literature on similar topics; however, the addition of an entertainment element introduces some objections distinct from those about similar cases, as the online comments vividly illustrate. We aim to explore and address the objec- tions in this paper, using the comments to organize and launch the discussion. In scientific work, there is 38 HASTINGS CENTER REPORT November-December 20 1 4</page><page sequence="2">typically a presumption of some pros- pect of translation and application of generated knowledge for public ben- efit. In the case of biotic games, these applications are not self-evident. Be- cause of this, a serious analysis of the justifications, limitations, and fea- tures of biotic games is warranted. To this end, we outline key ethical limits that ought to be placed on these ac- tivities as well as the obligations that these activities generate for research- ers, other professionals, and lay peo- ple who design, implement, use, and play them. What Are Biotic Games? Riedel-Kruse otic game "as s group any activity defined includ- a bi- otic game "as any activity includ- ing the necessary equipment (i) that falls under the concept of games, (ii) that has one or more humans inter- acting as active players with biological materials or processes, and (iii) where the game design and human experi- ence depends on modern biotechnol- ogy."1 This means that biotic games include some playful or competitive component governed by rules, and that they differ from the familiar use of animals in sport and games (such as dog racing or polo) by relying on biotechnological techniques to enable interaction between humans and bio- logical material. Riedel-Kruse and his bioengineer- ing lab at Stanford University have developed a series of biotic games - including Ciliaball, PAC-mecium, Microbash, and Pond Pong - in which players control the movements of paramecia in a fluid-filled dish by applying electric fields or chemi- cal stimuli via a handheld controller that resembles traditional videogame controllers. Players interact using the controller and observe the reactions of the paramecia on a screen with a superimposed game environment. Riedel-Kruses lab has also made bi- otic games that rely on polymerase chain reaction and yeast cultures, but these projects have received little treatment in the media. It is impor- tant to note that games simulating biological processes are not consid- ered biotic games; only those that use actual biological materials have that label.2 To focus still more precisely on the issues of using biological materi- als in games, we restrict the concept of biotic games to the introduction of biological material into games, omitting the gamification of biology research. This means that efforts to crowd-source research through games like Foldit or EteRNA, wherein users design protein and RNA structures, will not be considered typical cases of biotic games for this paper.3 Biotic games are subject to cer- tain normative considerations that follow from the very idea of being THE MANIPULATION of living matter frequently engenders at least some controversy in the marketplace of ideas. Using living things in games is no exception. However, the addition of an entertainment element introduces some ethical objections distinct from those about similar cases. a game. They should be fun, engag- ing, and intrinsically motivating for their players. These features are con- sidered thoughtfully in game-design literature.4 These features, however, are not the sole justificatory criteria for games. Although there are reasons to believe that games and play activi- ties are important, some games, such as gambling or violent contact sports, are ethically dubious. Suffice it to say that a well-designed game is not al- ways an ethically justified one. Riedel-Kruses lab notes that it expects its biotic games to be effec- tive tools for teaching microbiology and biophysics. Many American high schools already use paramecia in an observational or experimental setting, and biotic games may help motivate and engage students. Riedel-Kruse et al. postulate that students might dis- cuss and understand their scientific observations in order to identify win- ning strategies.5 The association of organisms with new technologies is an ancient phe- nomenon. The use of animals for transportation, protection, pest con- trol, and food can be seen as the early development of biological technolo- gies. The use of animals for games and sport can be viewed as provid- ing examples of interaction between biology, technology, and society. More modern efforts to incorporate technology and biological processes are myriad. B. F. Skinners operant conditioning chamber used technol- ogy to influence animal behavior, and around World War II, Skinner and others aimed to use pigeons to guide missiles, dogs to guide torpedoes, and seals to deploy underwater mines to submarines.6 Advances in technol- ogy have led to nonlethal but still somewhat strange ways of interact- ing with living matter. The Metazoa Ludens project at the Mixed Reality Lab, based in Singapore, uses digital media to enable playful human-ani- mal interactions, allowing people to exercise hamsters remotely.7 Another project from the Mixed Reality Lab is aimed at allowing remote interac- tion between humans and poultry via technologically mediated petting.8 Although all of these examples demonstrate interaction between technology and living things, biotic games fall into a different category insofar as they "biologize" games, meaning that they aim to implement entertainment modalities by manipu- lating life using biotechnology. The November-December 20 1 4 HASTINGS CENTER REPORT 39</page><page sequence="3">key difference between biotic games and the examples above is the game element. Biotic games are designed to produce an enjoyable interaction with biological systems; Riedel-Kruse and colleagues write, "[W]e hope that biotic games will be played for fun."9 This means that any application of biotic games toward a goal such as education must to some degree also just be fun. This consideration is the crux of evaluating biotic games from an ethical standpoint - although they can be used for education or other purposes, they should be fun, and we must discern to what degree manipulating organic, sometimes liv- ing, matter for fun is acceptable and what constraints ought to be placed on such activity. To some degree, our analysis in this paper poses and responds to the question, when is it acceptable to have fun with biology? It is worth mentioning that other groups have produced similar game- like activities, and although they are not referred to as "biotic games," nor even always as games of any sort, they either meet the definition of biotic games or could be minimally altered to do so. These examples make use of a variety of organisms, including cockroaches and crickets, to imple- ment many of the same designs that Riedel-Kruse et al. have developed into games similar to Pac-man and Pong.10 There is even an effort to fund and commercialize home kits for controlling cockroaches with smart phones.11 It is easy to envi- sion using these techniques to create and play games. There is a consider- able difference between cockroaches, crickets, and other more complex animals, on the one hand, and para- mecia, on the other, but these differ- ences should be considered through careful ethical analysis. We intend for our analysis to apply to biotic games broadly construed. What People Say Because et al. has the been work featured by Riedel-Kruse in numer- et al. has been featured in numer- ous articles that incorporate online communities, we decided to use the comments on these sites (see sidebar) to informally gauge public response and connect representative public re- sponses to topics already in the ethics literature. From the comments, sever- al points became clear. First, comment sections on websites are not brim- ming with sophisticated arguments, unsurprisingly. Second, nevertheless, many comments fit with arguments and positions treated in the bioeth- ics literature. Concerns about animal welfare, respect for life, playing God, slippery slopes, and whether this kind of work is worthwhile were all ubiq- uitous in comments, as were visceral responses. In the following section, we give examples of these comments and connect them to the relevant dis- cussions in the literature. Some of the comments may contain a degree of sarcasm or irony; the fact that these ethical concerns are voiced at all, though, whether seriously or sarcasti- cally, suggests that there is something ethically charged about biotic games. • Animal Welfare " This sounds a bit like dog fighting. Wait till PETA hears about this. " - At Scientific American, January 23, 2011 Animal welfare is an important ethical consideration, but its not applicable to the biotic games so far developed. Because paramecia are single-celled organisms without ner- vous systems, not animals, they are incapable of feeling pain.12 Yet many comments seemed to anthropomor- phize paramecia and indicate a lack of understanding of their nature, sug- gesting a persistent belief in the pos- sibility that they might be sentient and have the ability to suffer, showing that even readers of popular scientific publications can lose track of the dif- ferences between single-celled organ- isms and dogs or roosters. Anthropomorphic responses to bi- otic games are more likely a product of natural human tendencies than of the games, per se, so these responses are unlikely to disappear, especially for biotic games that make use of liv- ing things.13 This is not to endorse a defeatist attitude on whether the public can come to understand ani- mal welfare, however. The tendency to anthropomorphize animals, even microbes, is compatible with correct beliefs about biology. Surely, even neuroscientists sometimes attribute mental content to cartoon characters, toys, and so on - when playing with their children, for example - but that is a far cry from believing that the cartoon characters are feeling things. The anthropomorphic tendency can certainly correspond with incorrect beliefs about images and organisms, but it need not; the attributions and the beliefs are separable. And in fact, it would be impossible, and undesir- able, to eliminate anthropomorphic tendencies. A world in which it was epistemically incorrect for children to attribute attitudes to their toys would be strange and unpleasant. Whether or not biotic games can accomplish the goal of educating the public about the comlexity of animal welfare, there ought to be a broader goal of educa- tion through other means. Of course, animal welfare is a le- gitimate moral concern, and efforts should be undertaken to prevent ani- mal suffering in biotic games. • Respect for Life "But isn't this microslavery ?" - At Boingboing, January 19&gt; 2011 Respect for life was a basis for numerous objections in online com- ments. Respect for life appears in philosophical positions that are relat- ed to concerns about animal welfare, insofar as those concerns typically rely on some justification for respect. The Kantian view, in the Metaphysics of Morals, is that "cruelty to animals is contrary to mans duty to himself, because it deadens in him the feeling of sympathy for their sufferings, and thus a natural tendency that is very useful to morality in relation to other humans is weakened."14 Kants view here is not based on respect for life per se, but rather on the notion that 40 HASTINGS CENTER REPORT November-December 2014</page><page sequence="4">failing to respect animals capable of experiencing suffering erodes respect for persons. Other arguments con- cerned with respect for life avoid Kants anthropocentrism, however. Peter Singer argues that sentience is the basis for the ability to experience pleasure or pain, and he advocates a utilitarian approach for respecting life.15 Singer s view would not apply to games played with paramecia, giv- en that they are far from sentient, but it certainly applies to biotic games in general. Still others argue in various ways for the much more radical claim that all life has some moral status.16 Certainly, interesting arguments can be made to expand the moral community beyond the traditional anthropocentric concepts and justi- fications of agency and autonomy, and these radically biocentric views surely have something to say about biotic games. At the same time, these positions constitute a radical departure from the Western moral tradition. Especially in the field of bioethics, rational autonomy and ac- companying political commitments are foundational. A radically biocen- tric position might tend to undercut the moral status of humans, depend- ing on how human interests would be balanced against the interests of other living things. If only because of pragmatic considerations, it seems that the implications of a radically biocentric ethics for the political and legal treatment of human beings and other complex animals require quite a bit of careful thought, and that it would be premature to apply such an ethics to biotic games. In addition, its not yet clear why respect for life provides a compelling reason not to engage in biotic games, given the very wide and historically well-established range of permissible scientific and so- cial activities that involve interacting with nonhuman living things in some capacity. In our view, respect for life is an intuition that represents a starting place for evaluating interactions with living things, and a value that may inform or guide decision-making alongside other considerations and values. But any use of the value of re- spect for life requires an account of why this kind of life ought to be re- spected in this case and what actions are motivated or proscribed by those considerations. In short, the value must be accompanied by additional, substantial reasons. • The Promethean Objection "So we are the Godsy and the single celled organisms are the romans. " - On youtube. comy " The Bold New World of Biotic Games, " February. ; 2011 Other objections to biotic games reflect various moral views and taboos CONCERNS ABOOT animal welfare, respect for life, playing God, slippery slopes, and whether this kind of work is worthwhile were all ubiquitous in online comments about biotic games. that admonish against "playing God." Such objections have cropped up re- liably in response to the emergence of novel biotechnologies, especially those involving the manipulation of living things. As David Magnus and Arthur Caplan point out in a discus- sion of the "playing God" arguments lodged against the creation of geneti- cally modified organisms, they repre- sent an amalgam of concerns, ranging from simple disgust to precaution about the possible risks of manipu- lating living things to a commitment to responsible stewardship of nature that avoids excessive or dangerous meddling, to a kind of hubris that is evident in the wanton manipula- tion of creation.17 These intuitions are common immediate responses to novel abilities of biotechnology, but they are best viewed as starting points for ethical reasoning rather than stand-alone objections. If arguments that fall under the "playing God" um- brella are to be successfully employed, they must identify the features of ac- tivities that overstep the bounds of acceptable human "meddling," so to speak, and demonstrate why the ac- tivities are unacceptable. If they do so, adherents of the "playing God" argument would make their position more compelling to those who do not necessarily share their intuitive start- ing point. • Visceral Responses : The "Yuck" Factor '! disgusting they are life too. " - On Slashdot .January 15 , 2011 Another potential response to biotic games is a "yuck" reaction. These visceral responses tend to evince strong reactions, but without additional argumentation, they, too, do not result in compelling moral positions. The role of disgust in the moral appraisal of biotechnologies has been argued about notably by Leon Kass, who is echoed by Mary Midgley.18 Their positions hold that a feeling of moral repugnance is ethically sig- nificant and should not be ignored when evaluating a practices moral status. Although these arguments are based on the attractive view that ethics should not be a strictly ratio- nal project, that it should not be en- tirely divorced from agents' affective states, it can be counter-argued that these feelings are analogous to intu- itions, which give us a starting point in ethical deliberation, rather than being morally salient properties sim - pliciter .19 Repugnance has been used to justify immoral or unjust views, including support for segregation and opposition to miscegenation and November-December 20 1 4 HASTINGS CENTER REPORT 41</page><page sequence="5">same-sex marriage, so it is not unrea- sonable to ask for additional reason- ing to accompany arguments rooted in disgust. While people who are re- volted by biotic games clearly should not be compelled to play them, it is also clear that their revulsion is not by itself an argument against any par- ticipation in biotic games, nor does revulsion alone mean that an activity is ethically impermissible. More argu- ment is needed. • The Slippery Slope "Next thing you know it will be you and I in an octagon while someone tosses a single pair of rusty scissors while some Korean kids control our every action. " - On CNet, January 14, 20 II20 A popular line of criticism in the online comments, as well as in the ethics literature, has to do not with the case at hand but with cases to which it might lead - the potential future uses of the technologies. These kinds of objections should be familiar to scientists and bioethicists involved in the controversies over stem cell re- search and somatic cell nuclear trans- fer. Francis Fukuyama and Franco Furger voiced them when they ar- gued that technology is moving too quickly for the current regulatory framework and that the framework is not equipped to address the "unfa- miliar and difficult ethical dilemmas" that will emerge - and, moreover, that advancements in basic science were likely to be applied to human subjects.21 The slippery slope view is a capti- vating lens through which to analyze new technologies, given its appeal to the imagination and its parallels with popular science fiction. For precisely this reason, we need to employ it care- fully. On the one hand, it is true that novel technologies have potentially unforeseen impacts and that they of- ten stray from their original intent, meaning that some degree of antici- pation is important to make educated predictions about how certain tech- nologies should be managed. On the other, the slippery slope can lead to sensationalist arguments that under- mine the development of useful tech- nologies. It seems unlikely that games involving paramecia are the first step toward human-clone gladiatorial combat, but at the same time, the use of living things for activities that some may consider frivolous must be justified to set norms that govern these kinds of activities in the future. It is also important to consider the inverse of the slippery slope - that a technology is a step toward desirable but undemonstrated ends. Lacking convincing inductive evidence that an activity will lead to either good or bad ends, slippery slope arguments lack persuasive substance. • Trivial Pursuit: Are These Activities Worthwhile ? "Using living things for researchy Im to- tally ok with that. Eating living things as were higher in the food chain , Im totally ok with that. Harming living things for fun is not cool - Uncoolness factor being proportional to living thing complexity. " - On Slashdot, January 15, 2011 Probably the objection that will enjoy the most traction in ethics, as well as policy and regulatory set- tings, has to do with whether and for what reasons these activities might be worthwhile. Reasons for questioning whether biotic games are worthwhile are myriad, but they generally deal with whether they are a good use of monetary resources and researchers' time and intellect, whether their edu- cational or scientific outcomes will be significant, and whether manipu- lating life for the purpose of creating "games" is worthwhile. Although Riedel-Kruse is careful to make clear the educational and scientific intent of biotic games, the label "games" connotes trivialization, subordination of life to the purpose of fun, which to some may be a basis for fundamental objections. The as- sociation between games and frivol- ity may be strong enough to override the educational or scientific intent of these games for some. Lacking sub- stantial public benefit, biotic games would be vulnerable to the same kind of arguments employed in the Cali- fornia Fish and Game Commissions decision to ban the sale in California of the genetically modified zebra fish known as GloFish; manipulations enabled by a novel biotechnology should not be used for trivial ends.22 These kinds of objections reflect an interest in a balanced approach to the manipulation of living things. The bare ability to manipulate something is far from a justification to do so; we should take into account consider- ations beyond just the capabilities of science and the fun of playing with nonhuman living things. These arguments cannot be dis- missed off-hand because they refer to the attractive intuition that activi- ties, including those that make use of advanced biotechnology, ought to provide a reasonable balance between the degree of manipulation that they require and the benefits they pro- vide. Applications of biotechnology should not be undertaken without due consideration of their neces- sity and, failing necessity, utility, and should especially not be undertaken frivolously. It is possible to clarify the purpose of biotic games to give more defer- ence to this idea of balance. Although Riedel-Kruse et al. point to potential benefits of biotic games, such as en- gaging students and the public in sci- ence education, increasing economic output, and creating opportunities for open and crowd-sourced science, they are less clear, both in their press releases and academic publications, as to why these activities qua games add value to educational, scientific, and research projects, rather than trivial- izing them. More than adding value to the educational project, biotic games represent a step toward creat- ing new ways of allowing humans to interact with biological systems that may allow valuable advances in sci- entific knowledge, or may be a step toward manipulation of living matter for poorly justified ends. 42 HASTINGS CENTER REPORT November-December 2014</page><page sequence="6">• Positive Feedback "I think something like this might generate interest along with some out- side the box thinking by the public , to whom these games are being targeted. " - At The Guardian, January 19, 2011 " Overall ' expetimenting in and re- searching ways to make science educa- tion more 'sticky is just as important as farthering science. More people inter- ested in science propagates an interest in science , which means more money for science , more scientists, et cetera. " - At The Guardian, January 19, 2011 Although the objections to biotic games in online comments were in- tense, responses were not uniformly negative. Some online comments took more optimistic views of the biotic games project, referring to potential future applications in sci- ence, education, and interdisciplin- ary work. Ethical Analysis and Discussion The taken online seriously, comments yet not should too se- be taken seriously, yet not too se- riously. Even if some are based on misunderstandings, they ultimately represent feelings and heuristic views that stand to influence uptake, ad- ditional responses, and regulation of these technologies. It is also true that they are presented in a forum that is not known for sophisticated analysis and that should not replace substan- tive ethical analysis. It is worth pointing out that some lines of objection that have appeared in literature on related topics did not appear in the comments that we analyzed. For example, although there is considerable controversy re- garding the positive or detrimental effects of video games on society, no one objected that biotic games are inherently bad or harmful to the socialization of children.23 Also, no one objected that biotic games would desensitize individuals to the suffering of nonhuman organisms, though that thought may have been implicit in some comments. Finally, very few considered these activities to pose direct dangers to the public by way of, say, the organisms escaping the controlled environment of the game to cause ecological damage or public health problems - a view that has been considered in the literature on synthetic biology24 - though some believed them to be a step toward other, more dangerous activities. We believe that there are four central ethical considerations that set limits to these kind of activities: the duty to minimize the suffering of sentient creatures, the responsibil- HOMAN ACTIVITIES should not be wanton manipulations of the natural world but, rather, purposive efforts to improve the human condition. The question of whether biotic games promote scientific or educational goals remains to be answered. ity to balance our manipulation of nature with some notion of benefit and necessity, the duties of scientists to justify their work to the public, and finally, duties emerging uniquely from these activities qua games. First, we should look at the moral status of the organisms used in biotic games and the duty to minimize suf- fering. It is widely accepted that the moral status of living things results in part from their status as sentient beings with the ability to experience sensations like pain or pleasure.25 Be- cause relatively little is understood about the bases of subjective experi- ence, it is difficult to concretely de- termine which organisms are sentient and capable of experiencing pain. However, some degree of neurologi- cal complexity is required, and it is evident that even some invertebrates, such as insects, are sufficiently neu- rologically complex that we cannot rule out sentience.26 In order to avoid categorical claims about whether any animal suffering is permissible for the sake of technological or educa- tional advancement, we offer a rule of thumb: the degree of animal suf- fering should be commensurate with some concrete benefit or necessity. This is consequentialist thinking, but not straightforwardly utilitarian. The mere experience of pleasure, for how- ever many, is not enough to justify suffering, but other measurable ben- efits may be able to. We agree with those who hold that animal suffering for pure entertainment is prima facie unacceptable from a moral point of view.27 Going forward, we should keep in mind that the duties based on animal consciousness will change due to developments in the understand- ing of consciousness, and duties to minimize suffering should be respon- sive to our best present explanations of the bases of subjective experience. Finally, since paramecia, being single- celled organisms, have no neurologi- cal complexity, their use cannot be evaluated from the standpoint of sen- tience or suffering. Second, as the "trivial pursuit" comments indicated, we have an ob- ligation to balance our manipulation of nature with some measure of con- crete positive outcome. As a related consideration, we should not under- take research that is unnecessarily risky or dangerous; for example, it is obviously unacceptable to play biotic games that carry the risk that virulent pathogens or ecologically harmful or- ganisms will escape. This notion that the manipulation of nature is justified by its concrete positive outcomes was explicit in the decision to ban Glo- Fish in California, and it underwrites November-December 20 1 4 HASTINGS CENTER REPORT 43</page><page sequence="7">to a large degree the justification for funding research projects.28 It is im- portant that human activities are not wanton manipulations of the natural world but, rather, purposive efforts to improve the human condition. In this light, it is difficult to judge the moral status of biotic games, since, as games, they do not appear to be purposive in the same sense as other activities. The philosophical litera- ture on games often emphasizes that games are governed by rules yet are nonpurposive, playful activities, and that any positive externalities are unrelated to an activity s status as a game.29 Moreover, the game design literature adds and emphasizes inter- activity, internal (or intrinsic) value, and challenge.30 Taking these definitions into ac- count alone, there is little justifica- tion for using living things in biotic games. However, games and play ac- tivities may sometimes have beneficial effects beyond the intrinsic pleasure that playing them can afford. Games are thought to be intrinsically moti- vating and rewarding, and intrinsic motivation is very valuable when one is exploring and learning.31 Further, biotic games can be specifically de- signed to incorporate rules that pro- mote the understanding of biological activities and capitalize on the players' intrinsic motivation; if so, they may not be frivolous after all. They may be useful scientific or didactic tools. And if so, then they will be justified, so long as sentient organisms are not exploited. Ultimately, the proof will be in the pudding: whether they pro- mote scientific or educational goals is an empirical question that remains to be answered. What is perhaps most evident in the data we collected is that the responses of the public can be con- trary to the enthusiasm of scientists. Examples of this phenomenon are numerous in the history of bioeth- ics, from the advent of recombinant DNA to recent H5N1 research and work in synthetic biology, and de- spite much discussion, there is little agreement on the obligations of scientific researchers to justify their work to the public. However, given our first two recommendations, as well as the moral factors highlighted by the comments, we can construct a third obligation for scientists when communicating their work to the public through press releases, videos, and media coverage. We can look at these communications as not only disseminations of scientific work to the public but also as a mode of artic- ulating the justification for scientific activities. The keystone to this con- sideration is that members of the sci- entific community, by virtue of their curiosity and professional specializa- tion, have a unique standard for value when compared to the heterogeneous values of the public, which means that special care must be taken in communicating the motivations and justifications for research to the pub- lic. Even if sociological factors make it difficult or impossible to produce complete agreement on the value of scientific activities, our first two recommendations (to minimize suf- fering and justify scientific activities that manipulate life) can be viewed as generating an obligation to justify the ethics of, and reasons for, scientific activities to the public. Finally, it is worth considering the connection between the social, scientific, and educational value of biotic games and their special nature as games meant to be played and en- joyed. Although enjoyment or fun is not traditionally a difference-making feature from a moral standpoint, it is also true that humans of all ages (as well as nonhuman animals) derive significant meaning and pleasure from play. Although the ethical litera- ture on the value of play is relatively sparse, some have argued persuasively that play and competition are impor- tant social and cultural activities.32 Moreover, play is an important ele- ment of childhood development and socialization.33 However, these should be treated only as pro tanto argu- ments for games; they are not, as we argued above, absolute justifications for all games. If biotic games have educational benefit, which we see as plausible though uncertain, they have it insofar as they are fun and engag- ing. This generates further recom- mendations: Biotic games ought to be good games - enjoyable, engag- ing, challenging, and exciting - both in order to produce their intended outcomes and because games should be those things. They should also be respectful of the emotional responses of players, especially if they are to be used in educational settings. Biotic games should not cause the players undue discomfort. Furthermore, the organized use of such games should be optional; students are exempted from classroom dissections, for in- stance, for emotional reasons, and there should be similar exemptions available to individuals who feel uncomfortable playing or building biotic games. If these and the above considerations are taken seriously, bi- otic games stand to uphold both the values of ethics and scientific practice as well as values internal to the prac- tice of playing and producing games. We conclude that, as yet, there are no persuasive objections in principle to biotic games, as they are found in Riedel-Kruses work, and, moreover, that they can plausibly result in new, interesting, and productive forms of research, education, and entertain- ment. Moreover, since there is reason- able evidence that game-playing can enhance learning and since the public at large has an interest in a scientifi- cally literate citizenry, we believe that efforts to use biotic games as a means of disseminating knowledge should be pursued, although certainly within the limits of both ethical recommen- dations and strong public objection. With this in mind, we recommend cautious and continued work on the development and use of biotic games, as well as efforts to observe and quan- tify their impact.
