<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Encyclopaedia of the Qur3an. Volume One A-D. Edited by Jane Dammen McAuliffe. Pp. xxxiii+557. Leiden, Boston and Cologne: E.J. Brill, 2001. ?148.00. The Encyclopaedia of the Qur3dn is hailed by its editors as the first comprehensive reference work devoted to the academic study of the Qur'an appearing in a Western language. It is a text which aims to present the 'century's finest achievements in the sphere of academic studies of the Qur?an', serving as a critical reference tool for both students and scholars of the Islamic sciences. The volume under review is the first of five proposed volumes, three of which now have been published. Upon completion, it will comprise close to one thousand defined entries, focusing on concepts, contents, themes, personalities, and topics germane to the Qur'an and the Qur'anic sciences; indeed, the Encyclopaedia also broaches theological, legal, historical, cultural, and literary topics having a Qur'anic nexus and it draws from the 'rich scholarly heritage' of classical scholarship in the Islamic sciences. The detailed preface to this volume, written by its general editor Jane McAuliffe, explains that the Encyclopaedia is the fruit of many years of preparation, design and planning. Furthermore, she emphasis es that particular importance was attached by its editors to the fact that the Encyclopaedia should encompass a 'plurality of perspectives and presuppositions', presenting contributions by Muslim and non-Muslim scholars while essentially main taining 'rigorous academic' scholarship on the Qur'an. The entries for the five volumes are alphabetically arranged in the form of articles and extended essays. The first volume of this Encyclopaedia covers the letters A-D and comprises around 170 entries. A summary review of these shows that they are writ ten in a coherent and informed style. Indeed, each of the entries has an impressive critical bibliography of primary and secondary sources, furnishing extensive coverage of individual topics and themes. It is evident that classical aspects of Qur'anic studies and scholarship are prominently represented in the stock of entries for this and other volumes; issues relative to contemporary approaches to the text of the Qur'an and its exegesis are also given adequate treatment. McAuliffe states that the general editors debated the issue of the arrangement of entries for this Encyclopaedia, deciding to adopt a system of English-language head ings as opposed to the transliterated Arabic lemmata, the convention applied by the Encyclopaedia of Islam (El) and one which is typically considered the 'scholarly norm'. Intriguingly, the case made for this system of entries was based on the proposition that English language entries provided a greater level of utility and</page><page sequence="2">128 Journal of Qur'anic Studies effectiveness in the specification and designation of proposed entries, resulting in a more comprehensive exposition of a given entry. It is also argued that such an arrangement suitably serves readers being introduced to the Qur'an and its sciences for the first time. The editors claimed that while the Arabic lemmata conventionally employed in the Encyclopaedia of Islam, its sister publication, serves specialists in the field of Islamic and Qur'anic sciences well (it also furnishes greater precision in the identification of entries), it does not adequately assist scholars and researchers with no background in these sciences. With these considerations in mind, the editors adopted a system of alphabetically arranged English language entries and headings, all fully cross-referenced; the fact that the Encyclopaedia is clearly aimed at a wider readership rendered the adoption of this system an appropriate choice. Despite the adoption of a system of English language entries, the Encyclopaedia uses transliterated terminology for specific entries idiomatically distinguished in Arabic such as cAd, al-cArim, Aqsa Mosque, cArafat, Badr, Bahd?ls, Barzakh and Basmala. As expected, notable individuals are listed alphabetically: Abraha, Abu Bakr, Abu Lahab, ?A?isha bint Abi Bakr, cAli b. Abi Talib, Azdr, Bilqis and Dhu'l-Kifl. One also finds that the Encyclopaedia frequently includes transliterated terms which are pro vided with only an undefined heading and an appropriate English cross-reference: cAbd, Abu Talib, Ahl al-Bayt, Ahmad, Akhlra, Al-1Abbas, cAlamln, cAlawis, Alif Lam Mim, Alif Lam Ra?, Allah, Al-Ldt, Ansdr, Asbdb al-Nuzul, Ay a, Ayyub, Bdbil, Bahira, Bashir, Bdtin wa Zahir, Band Israel, Bekka, Dahr, Dar al-Harb, Dar al-Isldm, Dacwa, Dhikr, Dhimma, Dhu'l-Nun, Dhu'l-Qarnayn and Dunyd. Transliterated ter minology features throughout individual entries. The individual volumes of the Encyclopaedia do not comprise a separate index or 'reg ister of subjects' which would facilitate the identification of connected entries and themes. It is stated in the preface that detailed indexing of both English and transliter ated terminology is planned for the Encyclopaedia's final volume; however, this means that as the volumes currently stand they are without some sort of basic index or list of entries. Given the breadth and compass of themes covered in the many entries, access to an index is imperative, and indexes for each of the volumes would have usefully linked related English language entries and their transliterated equivalents. The Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam (1974), which employs transliterated Arabic entry words, has a practical 'register of subjects' in its index, although admittedly it is a single volume work. The register furnishes key terms in English followed by a list of transliterated entries relating to these terms; a revised form of this type of index would have been very useful, aiding in the tracing of relevant material with greater ease. The Encyclopaedia does include a profusion of English entry headings which have no accompanying definition, but rather a cross-reference indicating one or more</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 129 appropriate entries as illustrated through the letters A-B: Adoption (see Children and Family), Afterlife (see Resurrection; Paradise; Hell; Fire), Alcohol (see Intoxicants), Allegiance (see Oaths and Pledges), Allegory (see Language and Style of the Qur?an), Alphabet (see Arabic Script; Letters and Mysterious Letters), Altar (see Idols and Images), Analogy (see Language and Style of the Qur?an; Exegesis of the Qur?an: Classical and Mediaeval), Ancestors (see Kinship and Family), Ant (see Animal Life), Anthropocentricity (see Creation), Anthropology (see Social Sciences and the Qur3an), Apocalyptic Suras (see Sura), Appointed Time (see Freedom and Predestination; Time), Army (see Expeditions and Battles), Ass (see Animal Life), Association (see Politics and the Qur3an), Astronomy (see Cosmology in the Qur3dn), Asylum (see Protection Oaths), Atmospheric Pressure (see Natural World and the Qur3an), Atom (see Science and the Qur?an), Attributes of God (see God and his Attributes), Augury (see Popular and Talismanic Uses of the Qur3an), Balance (see Eschatology), Battles/Warfare (see Expeditions and Battles), Be (see Creation; Jesus), Beast of Prey (see Animal Life; Lawful and Unlawful), Beating (see Chastisement and Punishment), Bee (see Animal Life), Beguiling/Bewitching (see Magic, Prohibition of), Bequest (see Inheritance), Berries (see Agriculture and Vegetation), Betrothal (see Marriage and Divorce), Biosphere (see Animal Life), Birds (see Animal Life), Blood Kinship (see Kinship; Family), Body (see Anatomy; God and His Attributes; Anthropomorphism), Body Fluids (see Blood and Blood Clot; Biology as the Creation and Stages of Life), Bones (see Biology as the Creation and Stages of Life; Death and the Dead), Book of David (see Psalms), Bovines (see Animal Life), Brocade (see Material Culture and the Qur3an), and Buildings (see House, Domestic and Divine; Mosque; Markets). Included among the entries are many extended essays which serve as meticulous overviews of the subjects, themes, and concepts they tackle: Almsgiving, Arabic Language, Arabic Script, Archaeology and the Qur'an, Art and Architecture, Belief and Unbelief, Book, Calligraphy, Christians and Christianity, Chronology and the Qur3an, Codices of the Qur?an, Collection of the Qur3dn, Community and Society in the Qur3an, Contemporary Critical Practices and the Qur3an, and Cosmology. The detail and depth of scholarship are impressive. The following select examples of entries give some idea of the scope and nature of the topics broached by the Encyclopaedia: Abraham, Abrogation, Adam and Eve, African Literature, Agriculture and Vegetation, Ambiguous, Angel, Animal Life, Anthropomorphism, Air and Wind, Amulets, Anatomy, Antichrist, Apocalypse, Apologetics, Apostasy, Arrogance, Ascension, Asceticism, Authority, Basmala, Bedouin, Biology, Brother and Brotherhood, Byzantines, Cain and Abel, Calf of Gold, Caravan, Cave, Chastisement and Punishment, Children of Israel, Cleanliness and Ablution, Clients and Clientage, Colors, Commandments, Companions of the Prophet, Computers and the Qur3an,</page><page sequence="4">130 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Conquest, Consecration of Animals, Consultation, Contamination, Contracts and Alliances, Conversion, Courage, Court, Covenant, Createdness of the Qur?dn, Creation, Creeds, Criterion, Crucifixion, Cups and Vessels, Curse, Darkness, Date Palm, David, Day and Night, Day (Times of), Death and the Dead, Debate and Disputation, Decision, Deferral, Deliverance, Deobandis, Despair, Destiny, Devil, Dialects, Dialogues, Divination, Dreams and Sleep, Drowning and Druzes. This is in addition to a plethora of shorter entries which provide the work with a comprehensive edge. The Encyclopaedia comprises separate entries for individual prophets and other dis tinctive personalities recounted in the Qur'an; it also includes entries for prominent companions of the Prophet, although a Qur'anic nexus serves as the principal criteri on for inclusion. The editors however decided against including biographical entries for principal luminaries of the Qur'anic sciences such as Farra3, Abu Jacfar al-Tabari and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. This decision was based on the view that the Encyclopaedia's focus of concentration should be the Qur'an, although relevant aspects of these scholars' contribution to Qur'anic studies and thought are alluded to wherever this is pertinent to a given entry. Yet judging by the range of entries high lighted above, such biographical notices could have been easily accommodated with in the miscellany of entries. Biographies of influential luminaries create an excellent framework for appreciating principal Qur'anic concepts and themes; indeed, it is often through biographical notices that concepts can be contextualised, enhancing the resolution and definition of a subject. McAuliffe indeed states that this decision might be reconsidered should the Encyclopaedia generate a second, expanded edition. The standard of this volume's production is exceptional. Unfortunately, in the edition of the Encyclopaedia provided for review, oversights in the binding have meant that pages 533-40 have been omitted (the entry for dissimulation is incomplete and the entry which precedes it); these pages have been inadvertently replaced by the repeti tion of pages 515-30.1 trust that this error affects only a limited number of copies of the Encyclopaedia. This notwithstanding, it is notable that the fonts used are larger than those employed in the Encyclopaedia of Islam; moreover, two of the extended essays include a fine selection of illustrated plates. The essay on the Arabic Script includes eleven plates featuring copies of manuscripts and codices relating to the development of the Arabic script; while the entry on the Basmala includes eight plates illustrating the ornamental and decorative representation of the Basmala formula in different scripts and styles. These illustrative plates are of splendid quality. McAuliffe's preface to this Encyclopaedia provides an engaging overview of the his torical, political and cultural factors which have shaped approaches to the Qur'an; she has also provided a broad survey of the development of the exegetical tradition in the</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 131 Islamic world. The scope of this current review does not permit a substantial assess ment and appraisal of the Encyclopaedia's individual entries. However, the Encyclopaedia is clearly an indispensable aid to the academic study of the Qur'an and an important work of reference; its strengths rest in the extensive and authoritative coverage it provides together with the relative appeal of its general format, a format which will suit those being introduced to the text of the Qur'an and its concepts for the first time. Indeed, positive reaction to this publication seems to confirm its impor tance as a research tool and one can only look forward to the completion of this proj ect. Mustafa Shah</page></plain_text>
