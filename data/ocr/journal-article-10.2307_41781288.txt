<plain_text><page sequence="1">The auction site eBay is packed with objects purported to be ancient, like this "XTREME!" Moche-style ceramic vessel. By Charles Stanish Forging Ahead Or, how I learned to stop worrying and love eBay A little a archaeologists collective over a nightmare decade experienced ago, archaeologists experienced a collective nightmare - the emergence of eBay, the Internet auc- tion site that, among other things, lets people sell looted artifacts* The black market for antiquities has existed for centuries, of course, with devastating consequences for the worlds cultural heritage* But we could at least take some com- fort that it was largely confined to either high-end dealers on one end of the economic spectrum or rural flea markets on the other* The sheer physical constraints of transporting and selling illegal artifacts kept the market relatively small* But the rise of online auction sites promised to drastically alter the landscape* And so it did, just not in the dire way we had anticipated* Back in the pre-eBay days, the cost of acquiring and selling an antiquity was high* The actual looter was usually paid little, but various middlemen down the line added huge costs* During my 25 years of working in the Andes, I have often seen this dynamic at work* In years past, transporting an object was a big expense, even for portable artifacts, and the potential for arrest added to the total cost of doing business* In addition, the expense of authentica- tion, conservation, and occasional restoration of the pieces, made buy- ing and selling quality antiquities a wealthy persons vice* Our greatest fear was that the Internet would democratize antiquities trafficking and lead to widespread looting* This seemed a logical outcome of a system in which anyone could open up an eBay site and sell artifacts dug up 18 by locals anywhere in the world* We feared that an unorganized but massive looting campaign was about to begin, with everything from potsherds to pieces of the Great Wall on the auction block for a few dollars* But a very curious thing has happened* It appears that electronic buying and selling has actually hurt the antiquities trade* How is it possible? The short answer is that many of the primary "producers" of the objects have shifted from looting sites to faking antiquities* I've been tracking eBay antiquities for years now, and from what I can tell, this shift began around 2000, about five years after eBay was estab- lished* It is true that fakes have been around for centuries* In 1886, the celebrated Smithsonian archaeolo- gist W* H* Holmes described count- less bogus antiquities in Mexico* A few decades later, Egyptologist T* G* Wakeling noted that many ancient Egyptian artifacts were, in fact, fakes* In the 19th century, American and European museums purchased large numbers of "Etrus- can' ceramic vessels and sarcophagi that came straight from the kilns of rural Italian farmers* But these were usually the really good fakes, labor- intensive pieces that required lots of work and skill* Today, every grade and kind of antiquity is being mass- produced and sold in quantities too large to imagine* In the pre-Internet days, no one thought that so many people would be willing to put down good money for a low-end piece of tour- ist art* People who used to make a few dollars selling a looted artifact to a middleman in their village can (Continued on page 58) ARCHAEOLOGY • May/June 2009</page><page sequence="2">e ' »è Make Room for the Memories.

In an antiquities store in La Paz, I recently saw about four shelves of supposed Tiwanaku (ca* a*d* 400- 1000) pottery* I told the owner that most were fakes and she became irri- tated and called me a liar* So I simply touched one at a time, saying "fake," (Continued on page 65) ARCHAEOLOGY • May/June 2009</page><page sequence="5">(Continued from page 60) tt i tttt i c Ti' 1 ttttc 1 » real, real from c Ti' Iiwanaku, 1 ttttc rake, 1 "fake made by Eugenio in Fuera- bamba," and so forth* She paused for a moment, pulled one down that I said was real, and told me that it was also a fake* I congratulated her on the fact that her fakes were getting bet- ter and she just smiled* My mistake is an instance of what San Francisco State University archaeologist Karen Olsen Bruhns has identified as a very real problem - the experts who study the objects are sometimes being trained on fakes* As a result, they may authenticate pieces that are not real* You can use thermoluminescence dating, which determines the amount of time elapsed since a clay object was fired, to definitively establish the antiquity of a pottery vessel, if it is old enough* However, the cost of hiring a professional to take the sample and run the analysis is high for mid-range market, one sample can cost as much as $400* Since forgers commonly include fragments of ancient pottery in their work, multiple samples are necessary, making thermolumines- cence dating prohibitively expensive for the low-end market* Some eBay vendors are brilliant in this regard* They state that they will return a buy- er s money if they have a letter from a recognized specialist that proves the piece not to be authentic* However, www.archaeology.org this guarantee is nullified if you con- duct any kind of "destructive" analysis on the object* To the nonspecialist this seems reasonable* However, the sampling of a few specks of clay from a vessel for thermoluminescence dat- ing by a professional conservator is not even noticeable to the naked eye* While standard procedure in the museum world, this is technically a type of destructive analysis* It nullifies the guarantee, but it is the only way that a recognized specialist can pos- sibly prove the authenticity of a piece of ancient pottery* As a result, the guarantee is meaningless* Well-made stone and metal reproductions are almost impos- sible to authenticate* Some kinds of spectrographs analyses can rule out certain objects as fakes* But if the ancient source materials are used by the producers, it is very difficult to prove definitively whether a piece is authentic or not* The auctions on eBay are full of stone objects purport- ed to be ancient* With the advent of laser lathes and chemical techniques to forge patinas, anyone who buys an "Assyrian alabaster stone Mask 700 b*c*" or "Ancient Chinese Jade Carvings-Frog Arrowhead" thinking that they are real antiquities is, in my opinion, a thoroughly naive fool* There is another looming factor that dealers rarely discuss* As the After dominating the online market, obvious fakes have given way to "artifacts" that even experts have trouble authenticating. • 'PEOPLES INA NEW WORLD I I 1 .

So where does the illegal antiqui- ties market go from here? Certainly, looting will continue* There will always be the gamblers who do not end products continues to rise* Work- shops in new tourist destinations such as Puno and Ayacucho are popping up every year* As the fakes increase in both quality and sheer numbers, the real antiquities and the obvious fakes available will decrease* If you can sell a $15 Moche knockoff for $200, imagine what you can do with a really good reproduction* We can only hope, but it is just conceivable that online commerce will actually put a lot of antiquities looters and traffickers out of business by the sheer volume of sales and quality of products that fool even the experts* What drives this new dynamic is the small fraction of people who actu- ally believe that someone will sell you a real Moche Fineline pot for $200 (actual price: about $15,000) and have it shipped from Peru by mail without any risk* It is this money that provides the capital for the cottage industries to keep producing and fueling the cycle of ever-increasing quality and quantity of forgeries* There is, in reality, no mystery to all of this* It is the logical outcome of all buyers, sellers, and pro- We can only hope , but it is just conceivable that online commerce will actually put a lot of antiquities looters and traffickers out of business by the sheer volume of sales. * * act economically rational and will continue to look for a jackpot* The highest-end dealers will be around for a long time, but with significantly higher marginal costs associated with their illicit trade* But for most of us the Web has forever distorted the antiquities trafficking market in a positive way* There have always been Moche, Chimú, and Nasca reproductions that were difficult to distinguish from the real thing, but in recent years I have seen many, many more* The tradition- al workshops in the Peruvian towns of Piura and lea have been around for decades and the quality of their high- ducers acting in their individual eco- nomic self-interest* I suppose if people stopped believing that they can buy a pill that will help them lose weight without dieting or exercise, then it is possible that people will stop buying fakes online, and we will return to old-fashioned looting* We just have to wait and see what surprises the Inter- net brings us in the future* ■ Charles Stanish is director of the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology and a professor of anthropology at UCLA ♦ A version of this article first appeared in the Cotsen Institutes publication Backdirt ( 2008 )* ARCHAEOLOGY • May/June 2009</page></plain_text>
