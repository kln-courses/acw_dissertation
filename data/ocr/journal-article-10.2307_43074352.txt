Halkin (Photomechanical reprint of the first edi- tion in 1907). 358 p., ill. 23,5x16. New York 1968. Ktav Pub- lishing House. $ 12.50. Reprints of scholarly works of basic and real value are welcome, even after many decades during which research has progressed further and produced data unknown at the time of first publication. This is especially true of James A. Montgomery's monograph "The Samaritans", first published in 1907. The author's concept of the history, theology and literature of this earliest of Jewish sects still remains valid, although the material at our disposal is more extensive than it was over sixty years ago. At Montgomery's time neither A. P. v. Gall, Der hebräische Pentateuch der Samaritaner (Giessen 1914-1918), nor A. E. Cowley, The Samaritan Liturgy (Oxford 1909), nor J. MacDonald, Memar Marqah (Berlin 1963) etc. were available, although both first works were already promised (see p. 287 n. 38 as to the former, p. 297 as to the latter) and Memar Mãrqe (so pronounced by the Samaritans) was available in an incomplete edition of M. Heidenheim, Bibliotheca Samaritana 3, vol. 5-6 (Weimar 1896). Although a complete and satisfactory edition of Sama- ritan Hebrew, Aramaic ànd Arabic texts still remains as a pium desi- derium, we have a much better and easier access to original Samaritan sources than Montgomery had while preparing his excellent work on this subject which to-day has still not been surpassed. The unsurpassable documentary value of this work consists in the conscious presentation and careful digestion of the material on the subject available up to the author's time. He fully succeeded in his detailed and comprehensive sketch of Samaritan history as well as in his intention "to give a digest of the Samaritan theology" and "to note carefully the more important changes in the theology" (204). These two chapters remain a solid basic for all future research in this field. Even the chapter on Samaritan literature is not yet out-dated, even if we are now in possession of better material. A. S. Halkin's introduction to the reprint (ix-xxni) contains little more than a well-deserved laudatio of Montgomery's work and a brief sketch of Samaritan history mainly based upon Montgomery. All he finds to say about quite extensive Samaritan studies in the last sixty years is: "More of their texts in Samaritan or Arabic have been published. . . . Above all, a bibliography brought up to date would be helpfull" (xxm). It escaped his attention that such a bibliography as already been published nearly at the same time as the reprint of Montgomery's work was planned (L,. A. Meyer, Bibliography of the Samaritans [I^eiden 1964]). Although it con- tains no more than simple titles of works from the beginning of Sama- ritan studies in Europe up to the date of its publication, it presents in 49 pages about 815 items, i.e. 435 more than Montgomery was able to present in the 25 pages of his Bibliography (322-346). Apart from that</page><page sequence="2">Recensiones 587 the Elenchus bibliographicus in Biblica registers since 1950 about fifty titles missing in Meyer's Bibliography. At least, these could have been published in addition to Montgomery's Bibliography in order to help scholars to avoid the difficulty experienced already by Montgomery: "The history of Samaritans gives many, instances where first-rate scholars entirely ignored the labors of other specialists in the same lines" (xxvi). Halkin's remark mentioned above gives only a confirmation of Mont- gomery's statement. As the bibliography has already been completed, there is no need to deplore its lack! Material additions and corrections based upon more recent literature in order to bring Montgomery's work up-to-date would have been more to the point. There is no scholar who could accept without restriction all his own views published sixty year ago, even if his work were still considered as standard. And there is no better way of showing our respect to the author than bringing his work up-to-date - even if only in minor and less important details. If one can say about a recent book, J. Bowman, Samaritanische Probleme (Stuttgart 1967), published eight years after being written: "So much discussion of Samar- itanism has taken place in recent years that it is frustrating not to find it reflected here" (R. J. Coggins, JSS 13 [1968] 277), how much more it must be true of a book first published over sixty years ago?! A review is, of course, not the proper place for what could have been done in a few pages of additions in the book itself. I limit myself therefore to a few marginal glosses. It is gratifying to find that Montgomery's concept has not been supplanted and that there are only minor details that need be altered. Samaritan pronunciation of Hebrew and Aramaic was known to Montgomery only from quite unreliable works of H. Petermann, Versuch einer hebräischen Formenlehre nach der Aussprache der heutigen Samari - tañer , nebst einer darnach gebildeten Transcription der Genesis (Leipzig 1868) and from his still less significant Brevis linguae Samaritana gram- matica, litteratura, chrestomathia cum glossario (Carolsruhae et Iyipsiae 1873). The deficiencies and shortcomings of these two " pioneer " works (e.g. no attention paid to the very frequent long vowels as well as many completely wrong transcriptions) were already generally known in Peter- mann's time (cf. Th. Nöldeke, "Über Aussprache des Hebräischen bei den Samaritanern", GGN 1868, 458-504), but it took almost a hundred years before the Samaritan pronunciation was thoroughly reexamined by mo- dern scholars (Z. Ben-Hayyim, The Literary and Oral Tradition of Hebrew and Aramaic amongsť the Samaritans I-II [Jerusalem 1957] and III, Part I: Recitation of the Law, [Jerusalem 1961], with III, Part II: The Recitation of Prayers and Hymns [Jerusalem 1967] [all in modern Hebrew] and A. Murtonen, Materials for a non-Masoretic Hebrew Grammar II [Helsinki 1960] containing a pronouncing vocabulary of the words and forms of the Samaritan Hebrew Pentateuch arranged in a hardly usable manner according to the author's etymological fantasies, with III, contain- ing a hardly comprehensible Grammar of the Samaritan Dialect of Hebrew). As the actual Samaritan pronunciation of Hebrew and Aramaic was</page><page sequence="3">588 Recensiones unknown in Montgomery's days, he had to assume his transcription of Samaritan words and names from a combination of Masoretic Hebrew and Petermann's information: e.g. the holy mount of the Samaritans is called Gerizim (see General Index 354a), this inadequate transcription being taken up also in A. S. Halkin's Introduction (xni) and still being used in the same form by J. MacDonald, The Theology of the Samaritans (Rondon 1964, see General Index); the Samaritans are supposed to call themselves Samerim (24, 318), although this form is impossible either in their Hebrew or in their Arabic dialect; the Samaritan term for the "angels" given in its Masoretic (not Samaritan) form MaVahim (216) is supposed to have an (Aramaic) equivalent Sheliach (216), as if the Sama- ritans recognized the Masoretic patah furtivum and pronounced the laryngals; similarly unsatisfactory transcriptions are found in Aramaic words: Panuta "turning away" as a terminus technicus for "the Age of Disfavor" (241 ff.); Taeb "Restorer" as a technical term for the Samaritan Messiah (246 ff.) etc. The reader will perhaps be interested to learn that the above words are pronounced as follows: garizem (or more exactly ārgārizem, as the name of this mount DTinn is considered as a com- pound, both parts of which are always written and pronounced together), Šāmērem, mãlãkem, šāli, fānūta, tā* éb. He should at least be told where their actual pronunciation is to be found. But the transcriptions of Arabic and other Semitic words also are far from satisfactory to the eyes of a modern reader: both h and h are transcribed as ch, both d and d as dh, the length of vowels is never designated, cf. michrab (30:1) for mihrab ; Machmud (139) for Mahmud ; Chaber (179:2f.) for hādēr; Kokeba (189: antep.) for Ko kbä; shateph, sharik (208) for Šātef, šarīk; Chasan (293, passim) for Hasan; Tabbach (296) for tabbāh; Ischak (296, 311) for Ishaq etc. Not all of these antiquated transcriptions could and need be amended in additional corrections, but some of them really are mislead- ing and could hardly be rightly understood if they were not followed by an Knglish translation, cf. "Chizn Yakub ('the weeping of Jacob'), also called al-Chadhra, 'the mosque of the green (tree)' " (273). Without these translations the reader would certainly have difficulty in guessing that Chizn stood for huzn "sorrow" and not for hazn "treasure", even if he is able to decipher al-hadrā in the name "Chadhra". The most important contribution of our century, esp. of the last decades, is a more exact knowledge of Samaritan pronunciation, their languages and their literature. Chapter XIV (270-316) which deals with these subjects requires several additions. As regards the languages, at least Z. Ben-Hayyim's and A. Murtonen's Samaritanistic series should be mentioned. Although the former has not yet been completed (the Gram- mars of Samaritan Hebrew and Aramaic promised by Ben-Hayyim are still outstanding) and Murtonen's Grammar of the Samaritan Dialect of Hebrew is not a grammar properly speaking, these works contain much material which, seen in relation to the scanty knowledge of Samaritan Hebrew and Aramaic at the beginning of our century, may be designated as quite revolutionary. (A new Grammar of Samaritan Hebrew prepared by the reviewer in German will appear shortly in Berlin, Walter de</page><page sequence="4">Recensiones 589 Gruyter). As regards Samaritan literature, we are still lacking a major work on the subject; nevertheless, mention should be made of Moses G aster's "The Samaritan literature, Supplement to the Author's Article Samaritans", Encyclopaedia of Islam , Vol. 4 (Heyden 1925). J. Mac- Donald's chapter "The Samaritan Literature' ' in The Theology of the Samaritans 40-49 appears as somewhat retrogressive when compared with Montgomery's chapter on the same subject (286-316). A detailed history of Samaritan literature may be considered as one of the most urgent tasks in Samaritan studies. But there are also many other branches in Samaritan studies in which comparatively little progress has been made since Montgomery's days. No better concept of Samaritan history or theology than his has been developed. Montgomery's thesis that the Samaritans were the earliest Jewish sect representing a particular development of Sadducaean Judaism (73) and that "Samaritanism is a witness to earlier phases of Jewish thought than Jewish orthodoxy" (205) has not been surpassed, though the author's statement: "Its value in this historical regard has not yet been appreciated by scholarship" (73) has unfortunately remained true up to the present day. J. MacDonald, in his "Islamic Doctrines in Samaritan Theology", Muslim World 50 (1960) 279-290 as well as in his The Theology (see General Index s. vv. Islam, Islamic creed and doctrines), laid special stress on islamic influences on Samaritan religion. But his efforts prove to the reviewer nothing more than Montgomery's statement to the effect that: "Islam has largely affected theological expression" (204) together with his conclusion: "Islam does not, as already observed, contribute much materially to Samaritan theology, but nevertheless it gives a turning-point which is valuable at least for the purposes of chronology" (206). Whereas Islamic influences on Sa- maritan religion are much more easily examined (apart from the Samaritan Pentateuch and older Aramaic writings consisting of the Targum, Mēmar Marqa and some liturgical hymns, the whole corpus of Samaritan lite- rature was written in the Muslim era), special attention should be paid to the most ancient phases of the Samaritan religion. This requires a great deal of historical and theological reconstruction and has therefore been done only in part, and that insufficiently, Many problems mentioned by Montgomery need further investigation, e.g. his insinuation of a second circumcision at a conversion from Judaism to Samaritanism and vice versa (170 f.). For this question, cf. W. L. Dulière, "Iya seconde circoncision pratiquée entre Juifs et Samaritains", I ¿Antiquité classique 36 (1967) 553-565. The problem of the entire Samaritan history and development of their theology being a rather complex one, some detailed monographs on the single periods would appear desirable. For the Aramaic period this has been done in a dissertation prepared by H. G. Kippenberg under the direction of C. Colpe: "Garizim und Synagoge, traditionsgeschichtliche Untersuchungen zur samaritanischen Religion der aramäischen Periode" presented at the Theological Faculty in Göt- tingen in 1968 and which should be published soon. The reviewer con- siders this dissertation known to him in manuscript as a model for future</page><page sequence="5">590 Recensiones monographs on different periods of Samaritan history, for which Mont- gomery's work forms a solid essential basis. There are still many other points in which Samaritan studies have not advanced since Montgomery's days and many facts deplored by him have remained unchanged. His remark: "To this day no satisfactory edition of the Targum exists" (290) must unfortunately be repeated. Twelve years ago, the late P. Kahle told me that Padre Diez Macho was preparing a critical edition of the Samaritan Targum, but no part of it has as yet appeared. The "arbitrary editing" of the only edition of the Samaritan Targum by H. Petermann and K. Völlers ( Pentateuchus Samaritanus [Berolini 1872-1892]) was well known to Montgomery (291), not to mention the difficulties standing in the way of a new critical edi- tion (cf. 271). Unfortunately also, A. F. v. Gall's edition of the Sama- ritan-Hebrew Pentateuch, promised in Montgomery's days, a fruit of ten years of labour, cannot be said to be anything else than arbitrary: The editor preferred sporadic Masoretic forms found in one or two MSS to typical Samaritanisms attested in more than ten MSS, so that the reader does not find the typical Samaritan text in the edition but has to re-construct it from the variants in the critical apparatus. On the other hand, the famous Abīša* -Scroll, rumoured by the Samaritans to have been written by Abīša' grandson of Aaron (287f.), has finally been examined and published in a quadratic Hebrew transcription as well as in facsimile by F. Pérez Castro, Séfer AbiŠa* (Madrid 1959) but it contains only Deuteronomy and the last two chapters of Numbers in a somewhat fragmentary state. As in Montgomery's days, no satis- factory lexicon of the Samaritan Aramaic dialect has yet been com- piled, and Völlers' promise in this respect (271) has not been fulfilled. A Dictionary of Samaritan Aramaic has been promised by J. MacDonald (Memar Marqah I, p. xxxvi: bottom), another being planned by the present reviewer. On the whole, Samaritan research has seen no essential progress since Montgomery and its tasks and problems remain almost as open, as they were in his days. There is therefore very little in his work which requires material corrections, though some different concepts are always possible: In the comparison of ļmSiH mnv " Copiae tuae divinae" (Guil. Gesenius, Carmina Samaritana 70 n. 12) with the corresponding Mandaic term (216) there has been no graphical change of the initial laryngal in Mandaic, since the Mandaic word for angels is not mms but xnmy, with the same laryngal as in Samaritan Aramaic (cf. B. S. Drower - R. Macuch, A Mandaic Dictionary [Oxford 1963] 347 a). The wrong form quoted already by Gesenius is based on Norberg's erroneous trans- literation. - Although many differences between the Samaritan and the Masoretic Jewish Pentateuch are based on the anti-anthropomorphic tendencies of the Samaritans, I do not put the double change in mm IDtP mrr nonios ina Ex 15,3 (as opposed to the shorter Masoretic tf'K nlm nlrn nenSp) merely down to such a tendency, as Montgomery (276 n. 15) did, for (1) gibbor is not less anthropomorphic than īš; (2) an aņti-anthropomorphic concept does not explain the use of the preposition</page><page sequence="6">Recensiones 591 1 with the following word in the Samaritan version (the preposition being omitted also in nçnSo Tiaä nlrp Ps 24,8, with which Montgomery com- pares the cited Samaritan text). My explanation of the difference is as follows: In the Samaritan reading of the verse: šēma gibbor b am- malammo, šēma šēmu the older three-syllabic Qerē : adõnãy (cf. xúpioç I/XX) has been twice replaced by the later, specifically Samaritan bi- syllabic Qerē: šēma. In order to restore the original rhythm spoilt by the loss of two syllables, the Samaritans had to replace the monosyllabic īš by a three-syllabic gibbor bœ-, see R. Macuch, Grammatik des samari - tanischen Hebräisch (Berlin 1969) § 176bß. - The name of the Samaritan liturgical collection is given as "the Defter (through the Arabic from 8i&lt;p&lt;9ipa, i. e. 'the Book' " (298, repeated in similar way by J. MacDonald, The Theology 43). But its actual pronunciation corresponds exactly to Persian dœftœr which spread over the whole Near Bast and has well justified Iranian etymologies: (1) dipi + dar ^'containing writing" (cf. Bartholomae 774a, 790bf.); (2) dav + dar "containing Words, sayings" (cf. Bartholomae 687a); (3) dab "learn", (Bartholomae 679b), hence "manual, learning-book". None of these etymologies presupposes further semantic development, as the suggested derivation from Greek ("leather" &gt; "book") does. It is to be hoped that Montgomery's outstanding work on the Sa- maritans will stimulate Samaritan studies in the future more than it did in the past. Berlin R. Macuch</page></plain_text>
