<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Derivation of Marquesan Culture R. C. SUGGS THE GENERAL INTEREST among European scholars in the origin of the Polynesians and other peoples of the Pacific is almost as old as the discovery of the Polynesian Islands themselves. Explorers, missionaries, linguists, ethnologists, and archaeologists have attempted to approach the problem of Polynesian antecedents each from their own points of view, using native historical traditions, 'surface' archaeology, trait distribution analyses, craniometry, art studies, and linguistic features as the bases for their recon- structions of Polynesian prehistory. Stratigraphic archaeology, on the other hand, is a relatively recent arrival in the Pacific, appearing there only since World War II. The results obtained through tech- niques of stratigraphic excavation, however, have already considerably altered the complexion of the major problems of Polynesian prehistory. The purpose of this paper is to present the archaeological evidence for the origin of one Polynesian society-that of the Marquesas Islands-and relate that evidence to the conclusions previously reached by students of traditional history and trait distribution studies, and to more recent data provided by research in historical linguistics. Some tentative conclusions will then be presented concerning the relationships of the Poly- nesian cultures to other cultures in the Pacific as well as the pattern and chronology of settlement of the Polynesian triangle. Early explorers in the Marquesas Islands interrogated the natives that they met concerning the origin and age of the native society. Porter, commander of the American flotilla based on Nuku Hiva during I8I2-I3, was told that the Marquesas were settled by Oatea and Ananuna, who came from an island called Vavao, in the west (Porter I832, p. 30). The same island was again indicated to Gracia nearly thirty years later as the source of the Marquesan discoverers (Gracia I843, p. 5). Delmas, in the late nine- teenth century, compiled a list of all the islands mentioned in the origin traditions, including that of Vavao, Tokanui (Tonganui), Tetuiia (Tutuila), Kopou (Upolu), Manuka (Manua), Fitnui (Vitilevu?), and Aotoka (Rarotonga) (Delmas I927, p. 52). In addition, names of islands in the Society group were also included in this list. An- other list of islands supposedly visited by Marquesans in their movements from the west was obtained by Stewart (i83I, p. 273) but was never published. This description of the list however seems to indicate that representatives of the same groups of islands mentioned by Delmas were recorded. Thus early recorded traditions cited, as the source of the Marqaesans, islands in the west with names identical or similar to those at present associated with Western Poly- nesian and Melanesian islands. These names, however, have all been associated in the past in a variety of ways with other islands in Eastern Polynesia; therefore, without any proof of a more concrete nature than a list of commonly used island names, it would I</page><page sequence="2">2 R. C. SUGGS have been very dangerous to advance an hypothesis of Western Polynesian or Mela- nesian origin for the Marquesan culture. Later ethnological work in the Marquesas was affected to a certain extent by the prevailing traditional orientation that had developed around the turn of the century, according to which the settlement of any given archipelago and the evolution of its culture was the result of a series of sequential migrations arriving with various novelties of technology, economy, social organization, and religion. Linton, for example, saw Marquesan culture as the result of three different migra- tion groups, Indonesian, Melanesian, and Polynesian, each characterized by a discrete racial type and culture complex, which passed through the islands and often returned, resulting in a complex situation of both continuous and discontinuous distributions of traits within the archipelago (Linton I923). Other field workers viewed the Marquesans as offshoots of the Tahitian culture, for Tahiti was considered to have been the dispersal centre or 'Hawaiki' for Eastern Polynesia in the traditional view of Polynesian settlement. Generally, the early traditional evidence indicating possible Western Polynesian and Melanesian connexions was suppressed, the implications of these data being over- looked. At the same time, in Polynesian anthropology as a whole, a certain insularity arose with sharp boundaries being drawn between the Polynesians and neighbouring peoples, while attention was focused on the interrelationships and dynamics of Poly- nesian cultures, rather than on external connexions. Now, stratigraphic archaeology in Polynesia has provided us with a far wider basis than previously existed for assessing cultural interrelationships. The variety of imple- ments recovered in excavations in Hawaii, New Zealand, the Marquesas, and Mangareva open up many new and promising paths for future research in addition to illuminating much of what was previously quite problematic. The excavations in the Marquesas conducted under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in I956-8 have produced many interesting data for the reconstruction of the prehistory ot that group. Of the sites investigated during the two seasons of field work, the most interesting for this discussion is that known as NHaal in the valley of Haatuatua on the north-eastern corner of Nuku Hiva. This is an open village site, some six hundred yards long, on the high sandhills behind the beach at the bay head. It is the oldest site in the Marquesan sequence. Excavations showed that the site was a rather complete community unit consisting of a number of small house clusters and a ceremonial structure with an associated cemetery. Therefore, within the bounds of one site it was possible to investigate the major aspects of early Marquesan culture, gaining information on the physical type of the population as well. Three and a half months were spent in excavating this site, during which time the house sites were cleared and mapped, the ceremonial structure was completely investi- gated, several thousand artifacts were amassed, and thirty-six burials, mostly consisting of several individuals, were removed. Radio-carbon dating samples collected in I956 from hearths in the habitation and ceremonial areas of the site yield maximum dates of I20 B.C. ? i6o (2,o80 ? I50 B.P.; Isotopes 394 B, Shapiro &amp; Suggs I959), and A.D. 46 ? I50 (I9I0 ? I50, ibid.) for the</page><page sequence="3">THE DERIVATION OF MARQUESAN CULTURE 3 lower part of the midden deposits-the oldest archaeological dates so far obta ned in Polynesia. Worked exotic stone specimens from the site and the nature of the artifact preference-shifts n the stratigraphic record indicate that this site may have been inhabited by members of the discovering group or by a population that was not chrono- logically remote from the settlers of the archipelago. The cultural complex recovered in NHaal displays many interesting features, but only those of major significance for a determination of the possibilities of Marquesan origin are presented here. The houses were constructed of pole and thatch with oval or boat-shaped ground plans. Light wall- and roof-posts were set into pits and braced with beach boulders. A small irregular pavement was located near one of the houses, while shallow pits were scattered round the house floors. Houses showed evidence of repeated reconstructions. Oval or boat-shaped houses are found throughout Western Polynesia in Samoa (Buck I930) and Tonga (Golson I957; McKern I929). They are also found throughout Eastern Polynesia where they have been regarded as more or less of an archaic element, appearing in Easter Islands (Metraux I940, p. I94), Tahiti (Emory I933, p. 44; Handy I930), the Tuamotu Islands (Emory I938) and Hawaii (Emory I924; Buck I957, p. 75). Barthel in his recent paper (Barthel I959) on the round structures of Easter Island, has stated that the round and oval structures in Polynesia may be actually of Melanesian origin. The stratigraphic situation of the ceremonial structure on the site at NHaal was immensely complicated by a number of rebuilding periods of the original structure and intrusive burials. The earliest structure was a small oblong pebble-outlined enclosure in which stood at least one, and probably two, large monolithic basalt uprights, which were quite reminiscent of those known as the Inland Temple type, described by Emory (I933) in his analysis of Tahitian temple architecture. In Tahiti these are believed to represent the earliest style of ceremonial structures. Until the present work, however, structures of this supposedly typical Eastern Polynesian configuration had never been reported for the Marquesas. In fact, Marquesan temples of later periods, including those which replaced this structure at NHaal, are of the type characteristic of Western Polynesia and Fiji in which the temple structure takes the form of a dwelling house but is reserved for the occupation of the gods. However, very simple structures with stone uprights are also found throughout Melanesia (see SarasinI 929; Reisenfeld 1950) where they have often been singled out as evidence of a so-called Megalithic complex. Therefore, in addition to the previously known Marquesan temples of Western Poly- nesian type, a second variety of religious monuments existed in the early Marquesan sequence, as exemplified by the structure at NHaal. Temples such as this, formerly believed to be characteristically Eastern Polynesian, also show Melanesian affinities on closer inspection. It should be noted parenthetically that the early temple of NHaal has no counterparts elsewhere in the sequence, the style evidently having been abandoned early in the sequence. In I957 sherds of native pottery were recovered from the lowest levels of the refuse deposits. These sherds were from well-made vessels fired in an oxidizing atmosphere, tempered with a medium to fine textured volcanic grit. One rim sherd, from a flaring- mouthed pot or bowl, had a flattened, thickened lip with a groove running along it, a</page><page sequence="4">4 R. C. SUGGS trait found commonly in prehistoric Fijian pottery from the Early Period levels of Site I 7 (Gifford I95I, pp. 236-8) being also present in the Tongan ceramic material excavated by McKern (I929, pp. II5-I9). No decorative traits were present beyond the rim grooving. On account of the paucity of sherds at NHaal it was first believed that pottery- making had not been well developed. However, at a site in the valley of Hooumi (NHo3), inhabited approximately one thousand years later than NHaal, a large poorly-fired sherd was found indicating that the ceramic industry persisted for at least one millenium, with a progressive decay in technique, such as that which is evident in the archaeological records of Guam (Spoehr I957) and Palau (Osborne I958). As a matter of interest it is worth noting that the clays found in the Marquesas are quite suitable for pottery-making. Although X-ray diffraction tests on Marquesan clay show it to be of much simpler structure than that of control samples from Peru and Mexico, it still contains a variety of inclusions which can be used for producing coloured slips and paints, and furthermore fires quite well at rather low temperatures. Much attention has been devoted to stone adzes in earlier Polynesian archaeo- logical studies, as a result of which the distributions of various types are relatively well known. Comparisons are therefore on a somewhat more firm basis than when other types of artifacts are being considered. Stone adzes were recovered in quantity from NHaal with a variety of types represented in the collection. Most common was the non-tanged adze with a quadrangular cross-section known as type 2A, in Duff's (Duff I950) work on Polynesian adze typology. This type is most common in Western Polynesia. Also present but in low frequency were untanged adzes with triangular cross-sections, again found mostly in Western Polynesia. Two low-frequency types were well polished adzes with oval and plano-convex cross-sections, which have their strongest affiliations in Fiji and some rare occurrences in New Zealand (see Gifford 195I, pp. 263-4; Duff I 950, pp. I 76-88). The typical tanged adze with quadrangular cross-section, previously believed to be typical of Eastern Polynesian culture, was repre- sented by a few examples, surprisingly enough, for it has been the most frequently found variety in the extensive excavations carried on in Hawaii by the Bishop Museum, and also appears quite often in early New Zealand sites. One might therefore charac- terize the adze complex of the early Marquesans as being Western Polynesian-Mela- nesian rather than Eastern Polynesian. An interesting element in the ethnographic Marquesan culture is' the pearl-shell disc head ornaments with elaborately carved tortoiseshell overlays known in the native dialect as uhikana. Reichard (I933) has remarked that these characteristically Mela- nesian ornaments are found nowhere else in Polynesia except in the Marquesas. The closest point to the West where they are known is Santa Cruz, the New Hebrides. Because of the discontinuity in distribution of this distinctive ornament type Reichard believed that some kind of prehistoric contact had occurred between the Marquesas and the Melanesians on a prehistoric level (Reichard I933, chap. III). At NHaal, pearl-shell disc ornament components were found in both the habitation and burial areas, indicating that the arrival of this trait in the Marquesas may be traced back to the settlement of the archipelago, rather than to a post-settlement secondary migration.</page><page sequence="5">THE DERIVATION OF MARQUESAN CULTURE 5 Very interesting and unusual artifacts found in some quantity at NHaal are the small shell knives made from shells of the Tonna species. The knife is made by perforating the side of the shell and sharpening the edges of the circular perforation. The purpose of the implement was to peel root crops or bread-fruit, removing the skin in a strip which passes through the perforation and out through the shell orifice. Knives of this type are very characteristic Melanesian tools. They were found in the lowest strata of the earliest known site on New Caledonia (Site I3, Lapita, Kone, see Gifford &amp; Shutler I956, p. 65) and were used in New Caledonia into the ethnographic present (Sarasin I929, p. I04). Similar tools occur in Fiji (Gifford I95i, Fig. IA). In Polynesia, only one example of a knife of this type has been recorded; this was reported for Samoa by Buck (I 930, p. I .4c). The Tonna knife was replaced later in the Marquesan sequence by a knife made from a pierced cowrie shell (Cypraea sp.). Cowrie knives for peeling vegetables are quite common in Eastern Polynesia. Fishhooks and tools and debris associated with fishhook manufacture made up a large part of the artifacts recovered at NHaal. As yet, however, relatively little is known of fishhook type distribution in Polynesia and Melanesia. Only a few archaeological specimens are known from Melanesia while the bulk of the Polynesian collections are from Hawaii, New Zealand, and the Marquesas, leaving Western Polynesia still virtually unknown except for ethnographic specimens. Therefore very little concerning Marquesan cultural affiliations can be derived from a study of the fishhook assemblage. Two facts do stand out, however: first, the well-known bonito trolling hook (pa) believed to be characteristic of Western Polynesia is well represented in the collection; secondly, there is a conspicuous absence of the very common composite bait hook with point and shank separate found in Hawaii (Emory, Bonk &amp; Sinoto I959), Easter Island (Metraux I940, p. I75), and New Zealand (Duff I950, chap VI) constituting virtually a diagnostic for Eastern Polynesia. Burial customs at NHaal were quite diversified as in all Polynesian cultures, even in the period of European contact. Flexed and extended inhumation, long bone bundle burials (presupposing either exposure of the dead and/or mummification), inhumation with skull removed, and trophy heads are all found among the NHaal burials. Can- nibalism and ceremonial mutilation is evident. These practices have been reported for Hawaii (Buck I957, pp. 566-72) and New Zealand (Duff I950, chap III), as well as for New Caledonia (Sarasin I929, pp. 260-7I). Their spread throughout the area of Oceania in question makes them of relatively little value for diagnosing relationships, except that they again demonstrate a Melanesian-Polynesian continuity. A similar continuity is evident in the area of art, especially that of petroglyphs. Petroglyphs were relatively few in number at NHaal, and could not be associated directly with the stratification of the trash deposits. They were found on a rock-bed in a dead river course that bisected the site where they were partially obscured by a layer of coralline stone that had formed over the drawings before the stream dried out. I believe that the drying of the stream took place around A.D. 900, causing the abandon- ment of the site in favour of the well-watered slopes on the southern side of the valley. The petroglyphs show whales, sharks, turtles, dogs, and stick figures of men. Of these, the animal representations are relatively rare in Marquesan petroglyph art, but appear</page><page sequence="6">6 R. C. SUGGS in association with archaeological remains of all periods. The bulk of Marquesan petroglyphs, however, are composed of three types of motif: stick-figure men (called enata or etua), anthropomorphic masks with large circular eyes and wide mouths (called mata komoe), and units of concentric circles or rectangles which might be considered as abbreviations for the anthropomorphic masks. Von den Steinen in his detailed study of Marquesan art (i928, pp. 2i4-i9) concluded that the stick figure and the anthropo- morphic mask were basic elements of a vocabulary of art motifs of great age, dating back to the period before the occupation of the Polynesian islands. If one examines the petroglyph art of New Caledonia which has been extensively reported (Archambault I9OI, i902; Luquet i926) it will be evident that the same elements appear in that island also. The few petroglyphs and petrographs recorded from Fiji provide evidence for the existence of the anthropomorphic mask. Therefore, it appears that the Melanesians and Polynesians have shared in the same sub-stratum of art motifs. Some of the economic characteristics of the Marquesan settlers' culture might be discussed for the evidence that they contribute to clarifying the derivation of the culture. Animal remains recovered at NHaal demonstrate that the Marquesan settlers brought both the pig and the dog with them. Although bird remains were uncovered, they have not been identified as yet; therefore the absence or presence of the jungle fowl cannot be determined. Although the nature of the deposits prohibited the preservation of any vegetable material, certain deductions may be made concerning the domestic plant complex of the settlers from the presence of artifacts used for food preparation. A large number of coconut-grater blades of pearl shell attest the presence of the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera). The Tonna knives already discussed indicate that the standard Poly- nesian root crops (taro (tao), yams (puauhi), sweet potatoes (kumaa), and/or the bread- fruit were present. Pearl-shell scrapers of a variety used in the historic period for pre- paring bark for tapa cloth show that some or all of the source plants (Broussonetia papyrifera, ute; Cordyline terminalis, outi; and Ficus religiosa, hiapo, aoa) were present. The settlers of the Marquesas were therefore quite well supplied with most if not all of the major Polynesian food sources, both plant and animal. Finally, let us consider the settling group. The evidence at NHaal indicates that the earliest inhabitants may have numbered at least fifty, or perhaps five or six extended families occupying as many houses in the original nucleus of the hamlet. If a valley of the relatively small size and somewhat less favourable location of Haatuatua was settled by a group of this size, then certainly the major valleys of much larger size (Taipivai, Hapaa, Taiohae, Hooumi, etc.) on the south-east corner of the island would have also received 'seedling' groups of at least comparable size. It may therefore be concluded that the settling group was of a fairly large size, numbering at least two hundred people. (This of course assumes that NHaal was inhabited nearly simultaneously with the first settlements in the archipelago, as it seems to have been. If, however, the site of NHaal was inhabited only after a period of population growth in other valleys, then our con- clusions as to size of the settling party as well as age of occupation of the archipelago will have to be revised.) To summarize the foregoing evidence: the Marquesas were settled around i 20 B.C. by a fairly large and definitely well equipped group of Polynesians. The material culture of this group displays a variety of characteristics that aid us in assessing its affiliations</page><page sequence="7">THE DERIVATION OF MARQUESAN CULTURE 7 and origin. Ornaments, adzes, pottery, shell knives, houses, and temples show strong relationships to Western Polynesian and Melanesian artifacts and structures of similar types, while few of the diagnostic traits of Eastern Polynesian cultures are present. It appears, therefore, that the origin of the Marquesas should be sought in the Western Polynesian volcanic islands in a cultural stratum which is not too sharply differentiated from early Melanesian cultures. In the light of the archaeological data, the traditional historical accounts of migrations from islands in the west bearing names similar to those of the modern islands of the Samoan, Tongan and Fijian groups assume added sig- nificance and may well have a basis in historic fact. The evidence of Melanesian relationships on the archaeological level should cause little concern, for it complements the historical linguists' work on Eastern Malayo- Polynesian languages in which the Polynesian dialects (or 'languages' if preferred) are aligned as members of the Banks-New Hebrides group which also counts Fijian among its affiliates (Grace I 955, I 959) . These recent data revive much of the early work by Churchill (I9I I), Dixon (I9I6), Tregear (I 904), Smith (I 9 I 0), Balfour (I 9 I 7), and others who all seemed obliged to account in one way or another for certain resemblances, linguistic, ethnographic, and physical, between Polynesian and Melanesian groups. Much of the resemblance, whether real or fancied, was accounted for by interpretations of Melanesian and Poly- nesian culture contact while maintaining both groups as discrete entities. Thus, Melanesian traits in Polynesia were results of 'eastward migrations of Melanesians' or of 'Melanesian slaves' carried with Polynesian expeditions, while Polynesian traits or enclave social groups in Melanesia were labelled as resulting from westward migrations of Polynesians. Let us now turn to the implications of the Marquesan data for the dynamics of settlement of Polynesia. Heretofore, it had been assumed that the settlement of Eastern Polynesia had taken place in relatively recent times (c. A.D. I I00-I400). It was also believed that Tahiti was the centre of the dispersal for Eastern Polynesia as both Hawaiian and New Zealand legends seemed to indicate Tahitian origins, and many of the other islands in Eastern Polynesia showed strong resemblances to the Society Island culture. We now see that settlement of Eastern Polynesia occurred much earlier, at least by the middle of the second century B.C. Settlements were established in Hawaii by A.D. I24 and possibly in Easter Island by A.D. 380 (Emory &amp; Sinoto I 959). Although no earlier dates have as yet been obtained from the excavations in Samoa and Tonga (Golson I957), it is quite possible that some will appear in the near future. Recent excavations at Mangaia Mound or Tongatabu (Golson I959, personal communication) indicate the presence of a culture with similarities to somewhat earlier Melanesian manifestations. Furthermore, the early dates recently obtained from Eastern Polynesia force our estimates for occupation of Western Polynesia well back into the first millennium B.C. The role of Tahiti as the sole centre of Eastern Polynesian dispersal is challenged by the Marquesan evidence. Despite the absence of stratigraphic data from the Society Islands, we are able to make some evaluation of Tahitian prehistoric culture content by an examination of its two probable major ramifications: the early culture of Hawaii (Emory I959) and that of the later Moa Hunters of New Zealand (Duff 1950). These</page><page sequence="8">8 R. C. SUGGS sources indicate quantitative and qualitative differences between the early culture of the Marquesans and only slightly later cultures in Hawaii, showing that at approxi- mately the beginning of the Christian era, Marquesan and Tahitian cultures were recognizably divergent in much of their material culture inventory. For example, two- piece hooks with point and shank separate were common in Hawaii, as were quad- rangular tanged stone adzes. Hawaiian fishhooks were made of different materials to the Marquesan specimens-the former being mostly of bone while the latter were of pearl shell. The Tahitian and Marquesan cultures seem therefore to be derived from different groups, or possibly the same group but at significantly different times, so that their cultures differed upon arriving in Eastern Polynesia. Both apparently served as centres for dispersion of population-Tahiti being the source for the settlement of its close neighbours and Hawaii and New Zealand, while the Marquesas may have contributed to the population of islands on the fringe of Eastern Polynesia. No stratigraphic archaeo- logical evidence of Marquesan settlements on other atolls has been published; however, some published archaeological surface studies and legends have indicated that such settlements are not to be unexpected. Metraux believed the Easter Island occupation to have been from the southern Marquesas, identifying the Marae Renga of Hotu Matu'a with one of the islands in that group (Metraux 194I, pp. I8o-2). Laval believed that Mangareva was discovered and settled by Marquesan fishermen who ranged through the southern Tuamotu on fishing trips (Laval 1938). Danielsson records that the founder of the Raroian settlement was a beaten war chief who migrated from an island called Hiva Nui which he believes to be what is now known as Hiva Oa in the southern Marquesas (Danielsson I956, pp. 40-I). Until the results of the archaeological excava- tions at Easter (by the Norwegian Expedition) and at Mangareva (by Green) have been published, and until excavations have been carried out on Tuamotu atolls, these possible relationships will remain uncertain. Finally, the data of the Marquesas provide some evidence on the state of Polynesian marine technology. The well-known traditional students of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were quite willing to accord a very substantial capability to the Polynesians; a capability in the field of ship construction, as well as in navigation techniques and survival methods. These views were quite closely integrated with the accepted 'traditional' framework for Polynesian prehistory, in which cultural divergence and evolution were the result of successive contributions from contacts with other groups. A typical example of this type of reconstruction is the previously cited analysis of Marquesan prehistory by Linton ( 923). As is generally the case, a reaction took place against these often too generous assumptions concerning Polynesian navigation. Andrew Sharp has recently (I957) presented a theory which denies to the Polynesians any navigating ability for voyages of over three hundred miles distance. According to Sharp, the Polynesian islands were settled by drift voyages operating first in a general west-to-east direction and then reversing the trend with drift voyages following the prevailing south-east trades from east to west. The settlement of the islands was accomplished by small, often poorly equipped groups, as one would expect in cases of accidental voyages where fishing parties or raiders might be blown off course during short trips.</page><page sequence="9">THE DERIVATION OF MARQUESAN CULTURE 9 Domesticated plants and animals, according to Sharp, were in many cases diffused to the castaways by later castaways, thus allowing each society to make up its own economic basis in a rather hit-or-miss fashion. This interesting theory has been discussed at length elsewhere (Luomala I959; Suggs I 960); therefore only a few observations are necessary here. First, the Marquesan evidence shows that those islands were settled by a good-sized and well-equipped expedi- tion from the far west. Only one island is further east than the Marquesas-that is Easter Island, where settlement was established some five hundred years or more later than in the Marquesas. The closest islands to the Marquesas are those of the north- eastern Tuamotu archipelago over four hundred miles to the west. The Tuamotus were apparently settled in relatively recent times, however, probably by migrants from major islands such as the Marquesas; therefore they could not be a source for Marquesan settlement. Thus there is a possibility that the Marquesans sailed for some two thousand miles to reach their present home, against the winds and currents with a planned and equipped colonizing group. Data from Hawaiian excavations has convinced Emory that the remote Hawaiian chain was settled by a similarly planned effort. It appears that we shall be forced to grant the Polynesians a certain measure of navigation ability and seamanship after all, and the traditional views on the subject stand closer to the actual conditions than the more recent extreme theories. By way of summary, the following salient points may be re-stated: (i) On the basis of archaeological evidence, the Marquesas were probably settled by an expedition from Western Polynesia, as ancient native traditions claimed. (2) The material culture of settlers shows a number of affinities to Melanesian cultures both on the archaeological and ethnographic levels. It is therefore possible that the Melanesian-Polynesian dichotomy may be obliterated on the archaeological level as it has already been obliterated in historical linguistics with the two cultures merging at a point in time more distant then anything hitherto penetrated by archaeological research. (3) By virtue of its early settlement and geographical location, the Marquesas may have been a point of population dispersion in the occupation of the more marginal Eastern Polynesian islands, while those more centrally located were occupied from Tahiti.
