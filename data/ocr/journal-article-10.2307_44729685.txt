Chandler Protection and Survival Laboratory Civil Aeromedicai Institute Federal Aviation Administration Oklahoma City, OK ABSTRACT The General Aviation Safety Panel has developed recommendations for the performance of seating and restraint systems for small aircraft with fewer than 10 passenger seats, and has presented those recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration as part of the "Small Airplane Airworthiness Review Program". This paper presents the results of dynamic sled tests conducted at the Civil Aeromedicai Institute in support of the Panel's work, and discusses the background for injury criteria and other specific parts of the recommendations. INTRODUCTION The General Aviation Safety Panel (GASP) was formed in 1982 at the suggestion of (then) FAA Administrator J. Lynn Helms to develop a consensus of a broad constituency of the general aviation community regarding actions by which the FAA could positively influence general aviation safety. The GASP, consisting of members representing manufacturers, operators, aviation consumers, sports aviation, insurers and the aviation press, met between August and November, 1982, and submitted an initial report to Mr. Helms in February, 1983. This report contained several recommendations pertaining to weather, training, crashworthiness and dissemination of safety information. The Agency requested that the GASP form a working group consisting of knowledgeable members of the scientific and aviation community to develop specific recommendations to improve crashworthiness. The author was invited to participate in this working group in June, 1983. The first meeting of the group took place on July 6 and 7, 1983. Representatives of the National Transportation Safety Board, NASA Langley Research Center, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, the U.S. Army, the Federal Aviation Administration and industry summarized their experiences regarding the need for improved crash injury protection and methods for achieving that goal in small aircraft. It was tentatively concluded that the group would attempt to develop a practical, realistic test procedure for seats and restraint systems as a first step towards that goal. The group met at the FAA Civil Aeromedicai Institute (CAMI) in September, 1983, to witness typical dynamic test procedures conducted with general aviation seat and restraint systems, and to begin deliberation as to an appropriate test environment and adequate pass-fail criteria. The first regular working session of the group met in Washington, D.C., on September 27. It was agreed that the U.S. Army Crash Survival Design Guide (1)* would serve as a starting point for the deliberations. An initial attempt at defining the test procedure was completed at a second meeting in Washington, D.C. , on October 27. These criteria centered around a single test which provided combined downward and forward loading on the seat, using a 170 lb occupant in a controlled test providing an impact velocity of 31 f/s and a symmetrical triangular impact pulse of 0.10 s duration. Since there were little test data available to evaluate the likely results of this test concept, the author conducted a brief test series at CAMI, and presented the results and recommendations for a modified test requirement at the next meeting of the group in Savannah, Ga., on December 13. At this meeting it was concluded that the structural loads and occupant response generated in this single test would not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the provisions for crash injury protection, so a revised procedure using two tests was suggested. Again, there were little data available to judge the adequacy of the test procedure, so it was agreed to conduct a fairly extensive series of tests, using a variety of general aviation seats and restraint systems to obtain the desired information. The results of that effort form the basis for this paper. ^"Numbers in parenthesis designate references at end of paper. 4.388 0096-736X/86/9404-0388$02.50 Copyright 1986 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">850851 TENTATIVE TEST PROCEDURE AND CRITERIA The tests recommended in the December 13, 1983, session of the GASP working group included the following conditions: a. Occupant weight of 170 lbs, b. One "combined" forward and downward impact test which provided an impact vector having a velocity change of 31 f/s acting 60 degrees below the plane of the floor, having a symmetrical triangular pulse shape with a duration of 0.1s, and c. One "forward" impact test which provided an impact vector having a velocity change of 42 f/s acting 10 degrees to one side (yaw) of the seat, having a symmetrical triangular pulse shape with a duration of 0.1s. These test conditions resulted from consideration of crash investigation data presented by Mr. John Clark of the National Transportation Safety Board (2,3), of data from controlled small airplane crashes conducted at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Langley Research Center and presented by Dr. Robert G. Thompson and Mr. Huey D. Carden (4), from studies and computer modeling done by Simula, Inc., and presented by Mr. Joseph W. Coltman and Mr. Richard E. Zimmerman (5), and from the requirements for a meaningful dynamic evaluation of small aircraft seats and restraint systems as understood by the group. It should be noted that the data available to the group were not sufficiently specific so as to precisely define the conditions of the impact tests. Thus, the recommended tests represent a consensus of the experience and knowledge of the participants in the GASP working group as to what would be a meaningful and functional procedure for evaluating the performance of seat/restraint systems for small airplanes. Tentative pass/fail conditions were also discussed, and included a maximum load in a single upper torso strap limited to 1750 lbs, a load measured in the pelvis of a modified 49CFR572 (6) dummy limited to 1500 lbs, no submarining or roll out of the restraint system, and no structural failure of the seat or restraint system. Other conditions discussed included secondary impact criteria for cases where the occupant strikes a portion of the cabin interior, static test conditions based on a 215 lb occupant weight for loads characteristic of flight and landing conditions, and reduced requirements for passenger seats aft of the crew seats. In order to obtain an insight into the performance of contemporary seat and restraint configurations under the dynamic test conditions, two seat designs were selected by each of six participating aircraft manufacturers, and two specimens of each seat were provided for testing at CAMI. The 24 tests, one test of each seat under each test condition, were conducted in January, 1984. TEST ITEMS - The seats provided for this series of tests were typical of a wide variety of seats used in general aviation aircraft. While a detailed description of each seat is beyond the scope of this paper, the salient characteristics of each seat design, and the test numbers in which the seats were used are shown in Figures 1 through 12. No attempt was made to assure that the seats submitted for this program corresponded to production seats, and it was understood that some seats were modified by the manufacturer for these tests. TEST FACILITY AND TEST CONDUCT These tests were conducted on the horizontal sled-track facility of the FAA Civil Aeromedicai Institute in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The deceleration test capability of this facility was used in this program; i.e., the test pulse was generated by bringing the sled to a controlled stop. The sled is gradually accelerated (less than 1 g) to test velocity by a falling weight, allowed to coast freely for a short distance so that the test item and instrumentation can stabilize, and is then decelerated by contacting a series of wire metal-bender type of energy absorbers placed across the track. The basic element of the energy absorber consists of a length of 3 gage low carbon steel wire which is bent to fit over rollers on either side of the test track. The combined bending and tension in the wire as it is pulled over the rollers by the sled causes plastic deformation stress to take place in the wire. The energy required to generate this plastic deformation is extracted from the impact energy of the sled. By selecting the location and number of wires placed across the track, the deceleration-time pulse acting on the sled can be controlled. A typical installation is shown in Figure 13. The instrumentation system of this facility is designed to make use of conditioned bridge type transducers. A standardized instrumentation installation has evolved at CAMI for sled tests intended for research and development related to seats, restraints, and crash injury protection systems. That installation formed the basis for the instrumentation used for these tests. Some measurements may be unique. For example, the interaction forces between the seat track and the test fixture are measured at each seat leg by a triaxial load cell giving three orthogonal force measurements, or by a six-degree-of-f reedom load cell giving measurements of the moments about three orthogonal axes as well as the force measurements. These load cells are located in a test fixture which, in effect, allows the seat track to be deformed in roll' and pitch directions to simulate the floor warpage conditions specified in the Army Crash Survival Design Guide. The data which can result from these measurements provides the designer with a basis for evaluating the loads in the seat and floor track structure which result from test conditions of floor deformation and the test impact. 4.389</page><page sequence="3">Another unique measurement is made in the anthropomorphic dummy, which has been modified to permit insertion of a six-degree-of-freedom load cell in place of the adaptor block in the pelvis structure at the base of the lumbar spinal column cylinder. This measurement indicates the magnitude of the loads transmitted through the spinal column into the pelvis as a result of restraint system loading or as an inertial reaction from the impact deceleration. Other, more traditional, measurements made in these tests include three orthogonal axes of acceleration in the head, chest and pelvis, sled acceleration, sled impact velocity, and acceleration measurements in three orthogonal directions on the test fixture which simulates the "floor" of the aircraft. Whenever possible, loads were measured in the webbing of the restraint system near the anchorage points for the restraint. Sometimes these load measurements could not be made because the design of the restraint system precluded the installation of the transducers on the webbing. All transducers used on the sled are either bridge type (wire or piezoresistive) design or are arranged to appear as bridges to the remainder of the instrumentation system. Wires from the transducers are routed, with adequate slack to allow for motion of the dummy and test item, to a junction box where connection is made to a trailing cable. This cable, sometimes called a "whip cable" is an electrical connection between the sled and the trackside signal conditioning rack. The signal conditioners (Endevco Model 4470 with Model 4476 Amplifiers) provide power, balance control, amplification, calibration, and filtering for each individual data channel. The transducers used at this facility are designed for shunt calibration, and are periodically checked to confirm sensitivity, frequency response and calibration resistor values. Accelerometers are usually damped at 0.7 critical and have flat frequency response in excess of 1500 Hz. Generally, all channels are low pass filtered at 1000 Hz in the signal conditioners except for sled acceleration, which is low pass filtered to 60 Hz. Signals are then multiplexed using constant bandwidth techniques at an 8:1 ratio (Metraplex Model 114 FM Multiplexers) and recorded on direct channels of an analog tape recorder (Bell and Howell Model VR 3700B). A timing signal (IRIG B Mod), a camera frame rate signal, and a step function provided by the impact velocity transducer are simultaneously recorded on FM channels of the recorder. Shunt calibration of all channels is accomplished and verified just before each test to insure proper operation of the system. Immediately following each test, the recorded data are played back, demodulated (Metraplex Model 120 Demultiplexers) and displayed as hard (paper) copy through an oscillographic recorder (CEC Data Graph Model 5- 133). These oscillograph plots are made available to test personnel for "quick look" assessment of the test results. After completion of a test series, the analog tape is delivered for off line data processing. Each data channel is digitized at a 10 kHz sample rate, calibrated, filtered, scaled, plotted and filed for future use. Data analysis begins at a "time zero" identified as the second discontinuity of the impact velocity step function, a measurement made just before the sled contacts the brake. Vector sums of orthogonal measurements of accelerations, loads, or moments, and algebraic sums (loop loads) of belt load measurements are routinely calculated and plotted at this time. Any special analysis, for example the Dynamic Response Index (DRI) (7) or the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) (8,9), can also be done. Data collection and processing is accomplished in accordance with Society of Automotive Engineers recommended practice (10) unless specific test requirements dictate otherwise. Photometric data from impact tests are obtained from cameras oriented perpendicular to the track in the impact area and from cameras located at sites determined by test requirements. Two cameras (Redlake Model 41-004 HYCAM) are oriented perpendicular to the track to give redundant primary camera coverage. These 16mm cameras operate at a 1000 frame per second rate. Lens focal length is selected to give the best image size considering test item movement. Other cameras, usually pin registered cameras operating at a 500 frame per second rate (Redlake Model 51- 003 LOCAMs and others), and on board cameras were available if required. Each camera is provided with a time signal, either a serial form (IRIG B) or a numerical display, recorded on one side of the frame between sprocket holes in the film. A "time zero" mark is recorded on the other side of the frame. These time signals can be used to calculate exact frame rates and to synchronize the photo image with the electronic data. If necessary, the color photometric film can be processed on site between each test. The tests described in this report were accomplished using conventional practice whenever practical. However, certain preparations were unique to this test program. Seats were attached to the test fixture load cells through sections of floor track which were the same as floor track used in the airplane. These floor track sections were fastened to plates which were then bolted to the load cells. Seat adjustments (height, back and seat cushion angles) were in the mid position in accordance with what would be expected with a 50th percentile occupant. The fore-aft position of the seat was adjusted relative to the foot position to provide reasonable leg position for a crewmember. Whenever possible, manufacturers1 design points for the heel point and seat position were used to position the f ootrest . The footrest angle was 45 degrees for all crew seat tests, and the feet were held to the footrest with a wrap of fabric tape or string which was intended to tear at low loads. Feet were placed on a flat floor in tests with passenger seats. The position of the anchorages for the seat and 4.390</page><page sequence="4">850851 shoulder belts, when they were not anchored to the seat, were also located according to the manufacturers* design data. Relatively rigid test fixtures were fabricated to hold the belt anchorages, and no attempt was made to match the force deflection characteristics of the airframe. Belts were adjusted so that all slack was removed and the belts were snug, but not excessively tight. Inertia reels (emergency locking retractors) were not locked. The dummy, clothed in a cotton knit garment, was placed in the seat with the torso flexed over the knees. The buttocks were placed firmly against the seat cushion and seat back, and then the torso was brought upright to rest against the seat back. This procedure seemed to assure that the dummy was properly seated in position. The dummy was attached to the sled with a tether strap which was sufficiently slack so that normal motion would not be impeded, yet which would restrain the dummy in the vicinity of the sled if the seat or restraint system broke. The wrists were then connected with a cord (parachute shroud line) with about 18 inches of slack so as to allow normal movement but restrict arm flailing (and possible dummy damage) during rebound. The hands were placed upon the knees or, if armrests were used, the arms were placed above the armrests. After a final inspection by the manufacturer * s representatives and by CAMI staff, the sled was drawn back into position, a countdown executed, the sled released, and the impact accomplished. Impact pulses for the forward and the combined tests are shown in Figures 14 and 15. In the series of tests conducted to formulate the basis for the GASP recommendations, and reported here, the combined vertical test numbers ranged from A84004-15, and the forward tests were numbered A84016-28, with one invalid test (A84018) due to failure of brackets furnished to attach the floor track to the load cells. RESULTS The maximum values of pertinent data from these tests are shown in Tables 1 through 4. Data (primarily accelerations measured in the dummy and forces and moments in the various load cells) which are not pertinent to the GASP criteria and are not particularly useful to the designer have not been reported in the interests of brevity. It was sometimes not possible to make a certain measurement which was desirable; for example, if the seat belt did not have sufficient free length to install a belt load transducer the belt load could not be measured. This condition is indicated by "NA" in the tables. Data are also omitted for tests in which seat or restraint failure occurred, since the data may not have yet reached the maximum possible value at the time of failure. In evaluating the results of these tests, it must be remembered that none of the seats were designed to meet the conditions of the tests. In fact, the tests significantly exceeded the minimum criteria established by regulation for general aviation seats. The crew seat with a cast aluminum seat frame, the fabric seat pan, and seat belt and shoulder belt anchored to the test fixture used in tests A84004 and A84027 broke on the forward test, probably due to eccentric loads applied to the seat frame from the fore-aft adjustment pin on the seat. The seat belt was also partially cut by the webbing guide on the seat, but continued to carry load. The shoulder belt load on this test approached 2300 lbs. No significant damage occurred on the combined vertical test, but the pelvis load exceeded 2600 lbs. The welded steel, tube frame, crew seat with fabric seat pan and restraint belts anchored to the test fixture, used in tests A84005 and A84028 showed considerable elasticity during the combined vertical test, possibly because of the complex seat position adjusting mechanism incorporated in this design. This mechanism was bent during the vertical test, and pelvic loads exceeded 2000 lbs. No major damage occurred in the forward test, but the shoulder belt load exceeded 2200 lbs. The sheet metal crew seat, with the diagonal shoulder belt attached to the fixture and seat belt attached to the seat, used in tests A84006 and A840025 demonstrated no damage in the combined vertical test, and the pelvic load was only slightly over 1400 lbs. Review of the motion picture film for this test showed that the arms of the dummy contacted the armrests of the seat, possibly creating an additional load path for supporting the upper torso, and resulting in a low pelvic load, even though the seat back incorporated a "breakover" feature. The utility of this additional load path is, of course, only of value if the crewmembers * arms are over the armrests in an actual crash. Major damage occurred to this seat during the forward test, apparently due to the load from the seat belt segment which transferred combined loading from the shoulder belt and the seat belt to the seat. The rearward facing sheet metal passenger seat used in tests A84007 and A84026 did not use a shoulder belt. In the combined vertical test, the dummy* s torso was held against the seat back prior to impact with light cord which broke during the test. The pelvic load was only 969 lbs, possibly due to the friction of the dummy against the seat back. While no damage was noted on the combined vertical test, the seat broke under the loads applied in the forward test. The welded steel tubing seat with fabric seat pan and integrated double shoulder belts (with inertia reel) and seat belt used on tests A84008 and A84023 generated pelvic loads of only 690 lbs in the combined vertical test, with no apparent structural damage. Again, review of test film showed that the arms contacted the fixed armrests of this seat (which had a fixed seat back), and this probably created an additional load path which reduced the magnitude of the upper torso inertial loads transmitted through the spinal column to the pelvis. The utility of this additional load path will depend 4.391</page><page sequence="5">on the position of the crewmembers1 arms during a crash. In the forward test, bolts in the rear legs, which transferred the leg forces to the track attachment fittings, sheared, releasing the seat to pivot about the forward attachment. The crew seat with fabric seat pan used on tests A84009 and A84024 was positioned over a rigid test fixture which simulated the wing spar which normally supports the seat in the aircraft. No damage was noted in the combined vertical test, but the pelvis force approached 1900 lbs. In the forward test, the rear feet spread and separated from the floor track, apparently due to the loads from the seat belt. Nevertheless, the shoulder belt force was near 1250 lbs, possibly limited as a result of the long shoulder belt length which allowed increased belt elongation. The only seat in this series which used a sheet rubber seat pan was used in tests A84010 and A84021 . No damage was noted in the vertical test, but pelvic load exceeded 2100 lbs. The lack of damage to the sheet rubber seat pan is particularly notable, since similar pans have been reported to tear out in service. Perhaps aging or environmental degradation, not present in the pan tested, are critical in such reports. In the forward test, the locking pin used to provide fore-aft seat adjustment sheared and the seat moved forward on the floor track until stopped by the test fixture. This contact caused the seat to bend. The crew seat used in tests A84011 and A84022 was intended to absorb energy during a crash through deformation of the seat legs. In the combined vertical test, the seat frame deformed so that the fore-aft seat position adjusting pin was released from the floor track, allowing the seat to slide on the floor track. The pelvic load exceeded 2200 lbs, perhaps because the elastic nature of the seat height adjusting mechanism, located between the seat legs and the seat pan frame, did not transmit sufficient load to cause significant deformation (energy absorption or load limiting) of the seat legs. No significant damage occurred in the forward test. The welded tubing crew seat with integrated five point restraint system used in tests A84012 and A84020 showed no significant damage in the combined vertical test, but the pelvic load exceeded 2300 lbs. In the forward test, the bolt attaching the left segment of the seat belt to the seat frame stripped threads from the frame, and released the belt. The passenger seat with four legs used in tests A84013 and A84019 showed only slight buckling of the rear legs in the combined test, but the pelvic force exceeded 2000 lbs. In the forward test, the legs bent forward in a parallelogram fashion ("matchbox failure"), but did not release from the floor track, even though the plastic hinge at the corners showed partial separation. The rear cross tube of the welded steel frame of the seat used in tests A84014 and A84017 broke during the combined vertical test, perhaps due to direct loading from the dummy, and the seat pan fabric tore at the break. In the forward test, the anchorage fitting for the left seat belt segment broke at the slot for the webbing . The thick seat cushion with layers of energy absorbing foam, used on seats in tests A84015 and A84016, did not significantly reduce pelvic load, measured at 2600 lbs, in the combined vertical test. In the forward test, the tongue of the seat belt was pulled from the buckle, releasing the restraint. DISCUSSION A review of the data from these tests and of the high speed motion pictures taken of the tests was accomplished for the February 16, 1984, meeting of the GASP working group. This review seemed to indicate that the tests were stringent, but systems capable of meeting the criteria could be developed if carefully designed. COMBINED VERTICAL TEST - From the combined vertical test it was noted that only two seats with fabric seat pans showed pan failure, one of these from separation of the adhesive bond between the fabric and the seat frame and the other associated with a break in a structural tube frame. The rubber seat pan did not tear. This appears to be inconsistent with field reports of tearing of rubber or fabric seat pans. It was concluded that other factors, probably aging of the fabric or rubber material, play a significant part in decreasing the load carrying capability of the pan. Since these tests were made on new seats, tearing did not occur. It was also suggested that the "newness" of the test seats contributed to the adhesive bond separation, since the bond may not have had time to cure. However, the elasticity provided by fabric or rubber seat pans was observed in the film to contribute significantly to rebound of the dummy, indicating that this may be partially responsible for increasing the pelvic forces measured in the dummy. It may be necessary to choose other methods for fabrication of the seat pan in order to reduce the pelvic forces. Hopefully these methods would also be less prone to tearing, even after aging. Adjustment Mechanism - Elasticity was also apparent in the adjustment mechanisms found in many of the crew seats. While these mechanisms generally carried the required loads, the complex linkages showed considerable deformation, even though they appeared to return to their original position after the test. Since it would be difficult to definitively limit the pelvic forces with such an elastic mechanism interposed in the seat, it is expected that ł mechanisms with more direct load paths will be desirable. Armrests - In the tests in which the arms contacted the armrests, the pelvic load was significantly reduced. While the use of armrests for reducing spinal injury in military aircraft ejection seats was known as early as World War II (11), it is difficult to assure that the rests 4.392</page><page sequence="6">850851 will be used in a crash. Unless such assurance can somehow be achieved, armrests should be discounted as an effective means of limiting the pelvic load. Pelvic Load Limitation - The recommendation of a 1500 lb pelvic load limit is a unique specification. Several considerations went into this recommendation. Most specifications for limiting spinal injuries were developed by the military services, and depend upon acceleration measurements made on a fairly rigid seat bucket. This approach was rejected for two reasons. First, most civil aircraft seats donft have a defined "seat bucket." It should be apparent from the preceding discussion that it would be impractical to attempt to define a single seat acceleration measurement which would represent the acceleration input to the occupant of the complex, highly elastic civil aircraft seat. In addition, spinal injury can result from restraint system loads. Spinal loading from the restraint system loading is not accounted for by acceleration measurements, either on the seat or in the dummy. This concern is of little importance to the military services, since, as customers for the seat, they can specify and control the design details of the restraint system. However, for civil applications, such design restrictions would be highly undesirable. The most useful measurement would be one that directly reflected the stress in the spinal column, such as the force between the lumbar column and the pelvis. In a previous study (12), attempts had been made at CAMI to develop such a measurement. Dummies were modified to incorporate a load cell between the rubber cylinder which simulated the lumbar spinal column and the dummy pelvis. These dummies were used in the final phase of an extensive cooperative program among the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy and CAMI, with contractor support provided by Simula, Inc., for the purpose of investigating design criteria for energy absorbing aircraft seats. Subsequent inspection of the dummies used in that program indicated that the foam which simulated flesh under the dummy pelvis had deteriorated from long, heavy use, and this deterioration may have contributed to the variability of the measured pelvic load data. The dummies were subsequently refurbished, and then used at CAMI in a program investigating the performance of an energy absorbing seat with a rigid seat bucket. Data were measured which enabled the computation of the "Dynamic Response Index" (DRI), which is one of the more common measures of spinal injury potential used by the military. Data for the military population indicate that the probability of detectable spinal injury at a DRI = 18 is about 5 percent, and is about 20 percent at a DRI = 22. These computations were compared with measurements of pelvic force taken on the same tests, as shown in Figure 16. For the recommendations in the GASP study, a pelvic force of 1500 lbs was chosen as an upper limit, corresponding to a DRI of about 19 with an anticipated spinal injury probability of about 9 percent. Computer simulations of the combined vertical impact test indicated that the pelvic load limitation could be accomplished with a seat with an effective energy absorbing stroke distance of slightly less than one inch. However, if that seat were then occupied by a 95th percentile male occupant, the stroke distance would approach three inches. Lower values of pelvic force would probably result in a lower probability of spinal injury for smaller occupants of the seat, but would generate such long stroke distances with larger occupants that the chance of "bottoming" against the floor would increase the likelihood of injury to those occupants. It was concluded that a lower pelvic force limit could place impractical requirements (in general) on seat design for civil aircraft, requiring long stroke energy absorbers and consequently greater fuselage cross section. Also, long stroke energy absorbers in aircraft seats could preclude the efficient attachment of restraint systems directly to the aircraft structure because of problems of restraint geometry and load as the seat strokes. In any event, data are currently being collected at CAMI which indicate that the DRI may be a conservative indicator of injury, based on tests of crashworthy Army helicopter crew seats which have demonstrated good injury protection in actual crashes, yet yield relatively high DRI measurements in dynamic laboratory tests. The term "pelvic force" was used in the recommendation in order to avoid the temptation of comparing a measurement which might be logically called "lumbar spinal load" with the load capability of human lumbar vertebrae. Such a comparison is meaningless because the dynamic response of the dummy is not intentionally matched with that of the human in the spinal direction. This limitation is just one of the problems of dummies that are far from perfect tools for representing humans. World wide efforts are being made to develop dummies which approach the desired "perfect tool," but experience has shown that progress is commonly made with tools that are far less than perfect. As better dummies become available they should be useful in these test procedures if they are calibrated to determine an appropriate pelvic force limit which corresponds to the injury level of the 1500 lb limit recommended by the GASP. Results of the tests reported here seem to indicate that the pelvic force limitation is a practical recommendation, and should alleviate some seat design characteristics which could increase spinal injury. However, this pelvic force limit is based on comparison with military systems with effective upper torso restraint, so its use should be limited to civil aircraft restraint systems which also provide upper torso restraint. It should not be considered for evaluating restraint systems using only a seat belt, because those systems allow severe bending of the spinal column as the torso flails about the seat belt in a crash. The loads and bending moments which result are not considered in the 4.393</page><page sequence="7">simple pelvic force measurement. FORWARD TEST - The relatively low floor track forces shown in Table 1, and the generally adequate structural performance of the seats in the combined vertical test indicate that this test is not a severe structural test. This is not the case with the forward test. While it was expected that some seats, designed to accommodate a "9g static" load, would fail under the considerably greater dynamic loads, the finding that only three seats did not separate from the floor tracks indicates that this test condition may be a challenging design problem. The fact that many of the problem areas were concentrated in fittings or joints between structural elements, rather than in primary structure itself, shows the importance of attention to detail in seat and restraint system design. The problems with restraint system failures evidenced in these tests may be alleviated by systems which comply with a new Aerospace Standard (13) currently being developed by an ad hoc Committee of the Society of Automotive Engineers. This committee was formed by the SAE at the request of the Federal Aviation Administration for the purpose of generating a document which reflected the needs of an upgraded restraint system which were indicated, in part, by these dynamic tests. Head Impact With Interior Structure - Although only a few systems remained functional throughout the dynamic test, a review of the test films showed that it would be difficult to absolutely prohibit head contact with the glare shield or instrument panel if the seat were installed in an aircraft. It was judged impractical to test the seat in a fuselage section to evaluate this possibility, so alternate test procedures were sought. The procedure outlined in SAE J921b, Motor Vehicle Instrument Panel Laboratory Impact Test Procedure - Head Area, (14), was chosen as a practical alternative. This procedure specifies a laboratory impact test on the interior structure using a head form at a prescribed velocity. By viewing the test film from the seat and restraint dynamic test, and by overlaying an outline of the aircraft interior on the projected image, the contact point and direction can be determined and an estimate of contact velocity can be made by measuring the head displacement between individual timed frames of the film. These data can be used to establish the test conditions. A pass-fail criteria based on a Head Injury Criterion &lt; 1000 was chosen (15). This recommendation does not consider the soft tissue damage which can occur from contact with surfaces having small contact area in the interior, particularly if those surfaces are fairly rigid. These injuries are often described as cosmetic injuries, with the implication that they are of fairly mild severity. However, deep facial cuts can involve irreversible nerve damage, and result in permanent disfigurement. Unfortunately, there is no generally accepted test procedure which can provide quantitative assessment of this problem, so that pass-fail criteria cannot be established. The most successful test procedures use some form of skin substitute, such as moist chamois skin, over the head form during the impact test, with assessment of injury based on judgment of the tears or cuts in the skin. Shoulder Belt Load Limit - An additional limitation recommended was the maximum allowable load which could be generated in the upper torso restraint system. Such a limitation was felt desirable to encourage good restraint system geometry as well as to limit possible injury to the occupant. This load is most severe in the forward test, unless adverse restraint geometry and a deforming seat causes the occupant and seat to be "suspended" by the upper torso restraint in the combined vertical test. The limits were based upon a review of earlier tests conducted at CAMI (16) on a military restraint system which has provided good crash protection in the field, and upon a review of the literature. Although the test data were obtained with a 95th percentile dummy, when corrected for dummy weight they indicated that a torso restraint load of about 1600 lbs could be expected in a 42 f/s impact. Data in the literature (17) indicate that, for a diagonal restraint system of the type used in automobiles, a 50 percent probability of AIS 3 injury or greater would exist with belt loads of 1100 to 2000 lbs, depending on the age of the occupant. The test data, for seats which carried the loading of the forward test, showed shoulder belt loads between 697 and 2216 lbs. The low load occurred in a test where the restraint was integrated in the seat, and the seat experienced significant forward plastic deformation which limited the loads in the system but also increased the head strike envelope. A load limit of 1750 lbs for a single diagonal restraint was chosen to represent a level which would provide protection to the occupant in a severe crash and yet be feasible with careful design for vehicle mounted torso restraints. A higher limit of 2000 lbs was recommended for torso restraints with dual shoulder straps because of the increased contact area provided by the straps, which should reduce the severity of injury. SUBMARINING AND ROLL OUT OF THE RESTRAINT SYSTEM - The potential for submarining under the seat belt of a restraint system has been recognized for several years, and was acknowledged by the GASP working group. Unfortunately, it is not readily quantified by measurements made on the recommended dummy, although several experimental prototype dummies can provide that indication. Review of the film coverage of these tests indicated that submarining was apparent in' one test which showed the seat belt rapidly slip over the dummy pelvis while the belt was carrying the inertial load of the dummy. This type of observation must be made in evaluating compliance with the recommendation. Likewise, concern regarding rolling of the torso out of a single diagonal torso restraint strap was expressed, and this, too, was addressed in 4.394</page><page sequence="8">850851 the recommendation. It was intended that these limitations apply only during the period of the test when the belts were carrying loads from the initial impact. In other words, the free rebound which takes place after the initial cycle of belt loading can result in gross dummy motion which cannot readily be controlled by the designer, and this motion should not be considered in the film review. For restraint systems which use a single diagonal belt for upper torso restraint, the direction of yaw in the forward test may influence the tendency of the torso to roll out of the restraint. The initial draft of the recommendations attempted to provide guidance to the direction of yaw by stating that, for these conditions, the seat be "yawed ... toward the side of the seating device that is closest to the upper attach point..." (18). During the reviews of the recommendations, in an attempt to clarify the language, the wording was changed to read that the seat was to be yawed "in such a way as to cause the greatest load on the upper torso restraint system." While the load in the upper torso restraint system is one of the critical conditions of the recommendations, it becomes of secondary importance if the restraint does not effectively restrain the torso, i.e., if the torso rolls out of the restraint. Since it is difficult to predict the orientation which would cause the maximum load in the restraint, it would appear conservative to test under conditions which would move the torso out of the restraint (away from the upper attach point), if only one forward test is to be accomplished. FLOOR DEFORMATION - Considerable discussion took place regarding the desirability of incorporating floor deformation in the tests. It was argued that investigation of crashes frequently indicates that floor deformation has taken place, and may have contributed to the seat retention problems. On the other hand, it is not possible to "design" floor deformation capability with analytical techniques which are commonly available to the seat designer. Such design depends on empirical judgment to a great extent, and cannot be verified before hardware is constructed. In spite of these difficulties, the consensus of the GASP working group was that floor deformation was warranted. Guidance was provided by the U.S. Army Crash Survival Design Guide regarding the magnitude and technique of generating floor deformation prior to the test, but the floor track roll condition suggested by the Guide was dropped because the typical construction of seats for small civil aircraft possesses sufficient clearance between the floor track and foot fitting to accommodate considerable floor track roll without bending the foot or leg of the seat. This would not be the case if the foot were clamped to the floor track by "anti-rattle" devices or other similar mechanisms, as is typical of many passenger seats on large civil transport aircraft. The seat designer was given the prerogative of choosing the direction of one floor track pitch, 10 degrees up or down relative to the other floor track, in accordance with the characteristics of the design. One precaution must be observed when designing for floor deformation. Although it was acknowledged that the seat should perform properly if the floor tracks are deformed by external crash forces, it must be understood that it is also necessary for the seat to perform properly if the floor is not deformed. The floor deformation called out in the recommendation will, typically, cause laterally opposite front seat legs to go into tension and compression. If the impact forces serve to relieve the tension in one forward leg and increase the compression in the other, there will be a tendency to design the both front legs to carry the combined compression loads. If these legs are also the energy absorbing elements in the seat, the seat will then be too stiff in a crash in which the floor does not deform. The recommendations are not specific in describing the method for obtaining floor deformation and no guidance is given regarding the location of the pivot point for the floor track relative to the seat or what to do if the seat uses more than two floor tracks. It is common practice at CAMI to pivot the right floor track around a point which is about 1 inch below the bottom of the floor track and is 2 to 3 inches behind the aft foot of the seat. If the seat uses more than two floor tracks, the right track is usually pitched to obtain the floor deformation, and the remaining tracks held to a common plane, unless the seat design indicates a different condition would be more critical. In all cases the floor track is pitched 10 degrees (up or down) after the seat is installed either by manually pivoting the fixture holding the floor track or by using a hydraulic jack to force the fixture into place if the seat is unusually stiff in torsional bending. Perhaps these practices can provide useful guidance to others. OTHER MISCELLANEOUS FACTORS. The final recommendations of the GASP were the result of an evaluation of all the data available to the working group. Although the recommendations were worded in an attempt to most clearly represent the thoughts of the group, their brevity precluded explanations of all details. Some of these will be examined here. Dummy Type - The recommendations refer to the use of a 49CFR572 dummy, and an occupant weight of 170 pounds. This weight, a traditional occupant weight for the design of aircraft, is slightly greater than that of a typical 49CFR572 dummy, even with instrumentation and clothing weight included. The difference, less than 3%, should not be significant. The 49CFR572 dummy was referenced in the recommendation because it was the only standard dummy readily available at the time the recommendations were developed. It is expected that improved dummies, once criteria are promulgated to assure their consistent performance, will be useful in these tests if equivalent injury criteria are developed. 4.395</page><page sequence="9">Impact Pulse Shape - The initial deliberations of the working group were based upon consideration of a symmetrical triangle shaped impact pulse. From a practical viewpoint, such an impact pulse is not desirable, since it is difficult to generate an impact which produces a peak g with zero duration, and because it is difficult to control the descending slope of a triangular pulse. These problems were avoided in the recommendations by specifying only the minimum impact velocity and deceleration, and the maximum time to achieve the deceleration value (the onset time). If the pulse shape is triangular, or if at least half of the velocity change occurs during the onset time and the remaining pulse duration is not much greater than the onset time, then these specifications should be adequate. A more fundamental limit of the recommended pulse shapes is that they were based on a review of data and tests applicable to small aircraft as they have been designed in the recent past. Most of these aircraft have been designed under rules which limit the landing stall speed to less than 61 knots. If aircraft are designed with landing stall speeds greater than 61 knots, it is expected than their crash environment would be more severe than those considered for the recommendations, unless significant improvements in structural airframe crashworthiness were also incorporated . Other Structural Requirements - Of course, a basic result of the dynamic tests should be that the seat and restraint system does not fail. Components which are designed to yield (energy absorbers, for example), or components which are intended to break (tear out stitches in webbing for absorbing energy, for example), could perform in accordance with the design intent and still meet this recommendation. In addition to the criteria suggested by the dynamic tests, the group recommended that seats and supporting structure must be designed to withstand static equivalent loads imposed by a 215 lb occupant when subjected to the design loads as defined in the aircraft *s approved f light/ground envelope. CONCLUSION The recommendations of the GASP were formally presented to the Federal Aviation Administration as part of the Regulatory Review Program for Part 23 of the Federal Aviation Regulations . Like all documents submitted in that review, they are being considered for possible implementation in the Regulations. In the interim, these recommendations, as a consensus of knowledgeable specialists regarding appropriate performance goals for seat and restraint systems for small aircraft, should be useful to designers of those systems. This has been demonstrated in CAMI tests, where two modified seats have passed the tests, and new prototype crew and passenger seats have successfully achieved the goals outlined in the recommendations . ACKNOWLEDGEMENT There are many people who have made significant contributions to the development of the GASP recommendations. Some have already been mentioned. Mr. James Dougherty and Mr. John Berwick of Cessna represented the General Aviation Manufacturers Association and provided positive support for accomplishing the tests described in this report and in developing the specific details of the recommendation. Mr. John W. Olcott, Editor of Business and Commercial Aviation magazine, served as chairman of the General Aviation Safety Panel and accomplished perhaps the most difficult task of all, keeping the participants of the group directed towards the ultimate goal of the recommendations and achieving effective compromise among the various approaches presented by the participants. At CAMI, the tests were completed under unusually adverse conditions, where failure of the heating system in the test area frequently resulted in temperatures approaching the freezing point, and where construction caused numerous interruptions of the tests and made maintenance of clean working areas an almost impossible task. The tests were conducted under the supervision of Mr. Van Gowdy, assisted by Mr. Keith Pitts (instrumentation), Mr. Richard Forsythe and Mr. John LeGrange (operations), and Messrs. Fenton Winters, Lee Forrest, Jr., and David Dyer (photography). Their efforts, and the results they obtained, enabled the recommendations to be based on hard data rather than speculation. Finally, the author wishes to point out that this report has been based solely on the data gathered in the tests, supplemented by notes and the author* s recall of the deliberations of the working group. As such, it represents only the opinion of the author, and does not necessarily reflect the position of the Federal Aviation Administration or the General Aviation Safety Panel . REFERENCES 1.

A typical installation of deceleration system energy absorber wires is shown in front of the sled. The cable which is attached to the front of the sled goes to a 6400 lb weight which is used to accelerate the sled to the test velocity. As the sled picks up each energy absorber wire, and pulls it through the rollers located on each side of the track, the wire generates a force of about 2000 lbs which acts to decelerate the sled. By positioning the wires in the correct numbers at the proper locations along the brake, and with accurate knowledge of the impact velocity, the deceleration-time nistory of the sled can be controlled.
