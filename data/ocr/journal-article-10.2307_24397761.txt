<plain_text><page sequence="1">THIS IS NO MUSEUM Adrienne Williams Boyarin [N] either Proust nor Valéry is right, nor could a middle-of-the-road reconciliation be arranged. The conflict between them points up in a most penetrating way a conflict in the matter itself, and each takes the part of one moment in the truth which lies in the unfolding of contradiction. Theodor Adorno (183)1 This discussion of religion in the academy is oddly preoccupied with the museum, though neither religious belief nor much of what the academy houses is museal. We can trace the abstraction to James Simpson's contribu tion to Religion &amp; Literature 42.1—2, which echoes Adorno's "Valéry Proust Museum." His two philologists play Valéry ("the synchronic philologist") and Proust ("the philologist of continuous time"), and we are now drawn</page><page sequence="2">FORUM 227 into a new account of the Enlightenment subject's conflicting views of the museum, "both metonym and metaphor for scholarly study" (142, 141). The academy-as-museum turns out to be our dominant metaphor. Eight of the twelve other response papers in this forum engage it. Clearly it has some power. I invoke it again not to belabor any particular point in our own Valéry-Proust debate, but rather to explore conflicts, internal to the metaphor itself, that our reenactment reveals. We are no longer talking about faith traditions or positions in scholarly experience and practice, as we thought. We are speaking really about temporalities, the nature of the scholarly self and subjectivity, and potentially insidious questions of differ ence and identity. While it has had some provisional utility, the metaphor needs to be unpacked and jettisoned. For those who like the museum, its conflicts have turned out to be rooted in Western Christendom: fear of the Reformation "iconoclast's hammer," hope that Bunyan and Dryden can continue to coexist peacefully (Simpson 147, 158); social awkwardness and camaraderie revealed through "half smiles" between student and teacher "at the end of Mass," or through quietly shared "grimaces at the suggestion that Milton is remotely comparable to Dante" (Kirkpatrick 118); worry about upsetting, or being dismissed by, an argumentative Catholic student with his own convictions about the Virgin Mary (Bryan 149); discomfort with the self who could "accidentally ma[k]e a diverse group of students pray the Anglican evening service" (Bryan 149); or exasperation with what "most modern laymen probably think" about the resurrection of the body (Mann 130). This academy-as-museum evidently has trouble with "what is called 'the real world,' outside the academy" (Simpson 157), though its fears are emphatically interior. In these cases, the problem of emphasizing "ourselves as the essential reference point" in the museum is found in a lack of alternative reference points (Mann 133). Those who find the metaphor problematic are acutely aware that it can reify the "exclusivism and violence" it strives to overcome (Simpson 142). So Fatemeh Keshavarz's rebuke of the neutral museum space: "African and Asian scholars know how museums divide and label their objects geo graphically and, in many instances, do not look beyond Europe" (159). So Shawkat Toorawa's powerful reminder that this museum will elude him as a "'brown' person" with a "beard [that] gives [him] away" and a field of study that prompts not impartial silence but false assumptions from Muslims and non-Muslims, academics and non-academics, alike (166). In Toorawa's case, the street of the Parisian fruit-seller who once labeled him according to a language he studied ("le petit anglais") rather than his religion ("le petit musulman") sounds more like the museum than does the academy (168).</page><page sequence="3">228 Religion &amp; Literature To be fair, Simpson's '"Not Just a Museum'? Not so Fast" was itself a response to a binary that Kathryn Kerby-Fulton introduced in R&amp;L 42.1-2 with her comment that, through Nicole Klan's work on Margery Kempe and Pentecostalism, she had come to understand Kempe "not just as a mu seum of medieval autobiography but as a living history" (7, my italics). A section of the special issue to which this forum responds was titled "Not Just a Museum: Medieval Texts and Modern Belief." There is no doubt, also, that the extent to which the museum shapes the current conversation has to do with the attractiveness of both of Simpson's philological caricatures (all philos intended I assume), and especially with the attractiveness of his clearly inclusive aspirations, his desire for a space "that everyone, regard less of race, gender or creed, can enter" (144). The magnetism of the fear Simpson articulates, however, is polarizing. The museum of "eighteenth century northern Europeans" makes the academy a strangely temporally persistent "symptom of a deeply fractured cultural history" (144), and even paradoxically a wall against the "involved everyone" who might explode "vast new domains of scholarly activity" with "religious fundamentalist's bombs" (157). There are alarmist tones too—maybe provocatively so—in the vocabulary of censoring (and censuring) that accompanies this museum: good "children of the museum" (144) will want neutralization (echoes of Adorno, 143, 144 et passim in Simpson), repression and muffling (143), indifference, discretion, and silence (144), "stifling" (155), closeting of the noisy ones (157). This is the vocabulary that Jennifer Bryan regrets as too "half-heartedly apologetic" (150), and which Theresa Coletti recognizes in her assessment that Simp son holds to "the segmentation of the past and present represented by the museum" because of the "dark places" that this conversation might take us (204). Far from segmentation, however, the synchronic type—the preferable scholar in this museum—is "committed ultimately to repetition" of the past (Simpson 142). For this philologist, the museum "segments and recategorizes" only as a barrier to an ever-repeating past, for history is inevitable when the only possibility is reproduction (143). He is Benjamin's angel of history, looking backward at "wreckage upon wreckage" (257).2 His commitment to repetition (even worse, ersatz replication) cues a Carlylean nightmare of "Time was, Time is," where a singular "shadow of realities eternal, infinite" invades and demands uncanny "mutual elucidation" between us and them (Carlyle 68, 72, 45). This is something fearful indeed. Litde wonder that this conversation at times comes down to identity and ideology. There are warnings about professional and pedagogical missteps here. There are cautions about divisive, even field-altering, lack of discre</page><page sequence="4">FORUM 229 tion: where Simpson wonders whether "confessionalization" might divide and threaten to "destroy the institutions of literary criticism" (155), Peter Hawkins shares Rachel Jacoff's assessment that Charles Singleton's false confessionalizing forced the whole tone of American Dante criticism "to give way" (144, n. 6), and Jennifer Bryan suggests that "medieval studies is doomed" if students focus on "what pertains to [their] own identities]" (149). Fatemah Keshavarz is absolutely right that "one can object to equat ing a scholar's open admission of her faith with what Simpson calls the 'confessionalization of the academy' and a prelude to violence" (159). One is also obliged to object to Bryan's notion that R&amp;L 42.1-2 contributors are teaching and working "under the pretense of being more honest and real," prompted by a "simplistic sense of identification, motivation, and affect" that has led them to "the less-complicated option of just checking a box... [which] seems to be the normal procedure for 'committed scholarship'" (146, 148). It should go without saying that serious attention to, just for instance, Daniel Boyarin's philology or Susan Einbinder's source work or Amira Sonbol's account of her archival work makes it difficult to sustain such suggestions. Nevertheless, Jill Mann sees correctly that the original contributors were themselves more often talking about "cultural or social identity" than belief per se (127). For my part, I am not particularly interested in belief in my scholarship (and anyway, as Bruno Latour has put it, " [b] elief is a caricature of religion" [121]).31 am interested in cultural traditions and social and ritual practices, and in the constructed or perceived (which is not to say unreal) identities that accompany and react to them. Those interests, as I detailed in R&amp;L 42.1-2, have curiously overlapped in my personal and professional life, and I am unashamed to suggest that I have reasons to care about certain critical questions more than others. Elsewhere, the prevalence of "social and cultural identity" issues is, I think, no curiosity: it is a testament to the complex and shifting nature of belief- and faith-claims that each contributor knows well in personal and historical realms. It is particularly a reflection of the complexity of cultural identifiers that, within faith groups, so often trump individual, interior struggles with belief. It is also a tacit acknowledgment of what Robin Kirkpatrick makes plain: that faith dwells in "forms of thinking and discourse too specifically personal or even too messy to be caught in the decencies of debate" (119). The unspoken inversion of our dominant metaphor is apparently the pulpit, or the church (I am unsure if it is also the synagogue or the mosque), but the related belief-scholarship dichotomy embraced in some of the responses to R&amp;L 42.1-2 is a universalizing straw man.</page><page sequence="5">230 Religion &amp; Literature Always Contextualize A continuing and deep and serious quarrel with religion shaped me, and it was of course a quarrel with a particular kind of religion because I was raised as an Episco palian, in a liturgical tradition... .And I felt constrained by many of the assumptions I'd been reared with, but they had been too important in shaping me for me simply to discard them. I needed to fight with them. And the way in which you fight with something that is doctrinaire is to put it in context. (Bynum) "Teaching religion in the literature classroom," says Jennifer Bryan, "is a tricky business" (149). I whole-heartedly agree, as I am sure would every contributor to R&amp;LA2.1-2 and the present forum. Several of these responses discuss teaching in one way or another (Kirkpatrick, Hawkins, Bryan, Toorawa, Coletti). It is a vitally important consideration, arguably much more important than any journal-bound conversation between academics. We are all educators as well as scholars. We should be in the business of making knowledge open, accessible, and rigorously debatable for everyone. Those of us in what Bryan calls "the Bynum generation" are, in my view, influenced not only by Bynum's emphasis on the differences between past and present but also by her frank admissions of personal investment, and by her description of teaching as an effort to make students "realize that there is something that disturbs them as modern people, and that people in the past were disturbed by the same kinds of problems." In Bynum's view, the goal "is to get students to see that ideas matter so profoundly that they have to explore them, they have to disagree about them," and this means finding "something that comes close enough to them that they can talk about it and yet that can be distanced in some way." It is hard to imagine this happening in silence, or without involving students and teachers. I am aware that I have thrown pedagogy into the ring myself by men tioning, in my R&amp;L 42.1-2 piece "Desire for Religion," the urgency of "rough and raw" student questions that sometimes act as useful catalysts for discussion of religious thought when I am teaching certain texts and topics (25-26). I have done it again by inviting a few of my graduate stu dents to participate in this forum and thereby giving them opportunity to comment on my teaching. One way I presented our current topic to these students—in an advanced class on anti-Jewish rhetoric, real and narrative religious violence, and processes of othering—was to offer them R&amp;L 42.1-2 and my essay. Rather than showing up with hammers after that, however, they returned to the problem of subjectivity and biased historiographies with some frequency. They showed a hyper-awareness of their inability to read like anyone else (like a Jew, like a person living in thirteenth-century</page><page sequence="6">FORUM 231 England, like a medieval Christian, like a bigot, etc.), and they sometimes, as a consequence, noticed that a given text could manipulate complacency about such positions. Obviously then I do think that a graduate seminar that directly engages some of the topics in our current conversation and includes trans-historical studies can be an appropriate place to bring up subjectivities and temporali ties. This even if (especially if) classroom discussions must be curtailed and problematized as presentism and teleology creep in, for exactly the reasons that Susan Einbinder questions certain kinds of assumptions about Jewish history and heroism (199-201). But that is a very specific context. That class room was one where we more often compared and contrasted patterns of form, type, and genre, or trans-historical mechanisms of thought, fear, and political and economic motivators, than we did pause to acknowledge the messy impact of our various present investments in and, yes, feelings about the bigotry and religious violence we studied. Neutrality was of little use in those pauses, though. If we do not start by feeling about such horrendous things, where is it that we are trying to end up? Everyone has multiple identities, multiple performative positions, mul tiple stories to tell, and multiple relations to the past and present, as Bryan emphasizes (146). Contributors to the volume under consideration are not offering a context-free "reductive version" of themselves and their scholar ship (Bryan 150), nor are they walking into their classrooms and announcing their religious beliefs, nor suggesting that they are teaching from their beliefs, nor that anyone should, nor are they always teaching anything relevant to the current discussion. In any case, teaching from a subject position (if and when one chooses to do so, and allowing that some subject positions are not matters of choice) is not advocacy or proselytizing. The kind of neutrality that is desirable in the classroom is one that allows questions, disagreements, multiple positions, and powerful voices, not because all positions can advo cate for themselves unchecked by critical rigor or periodization but exactly because the space is safe from advocacy. Even within a noisy classroom (certainly not a museum exhibit on a quiet day), we should remember too that which institution, which classroom, which student, which text or event, and which teacher still matters—a point that both Peter Hawkins and Kerby-Fulton make above (137, 221). These variables will necessarily shift what is possible and what is neutral. Indeed, context can flip the debate on its head, as Gillian Steinberg pointed out in her account of teaching Chaucer at Yeshiva University some years ago: "The problems of discomfort with and apprehension of secular texts will, I imagine, always exist at Yeshiva University, where religious and secular thought, old and new worlds, clash on a daily basis" (236, my italics). The forum contributors who</page><page sequence="7">232 Religion de Literature mention their teaching selves do so in differing contexts and for different reasons, and (the uncomfortably obvious point) none of our classrooms is this context. A refereed academic journal that solicits "explicit commentary about.. .faith traditions and positions" does not ipsofacto involve the classroom or impugn the teacher (Kerby-Fulton, "Something Fearful" 5). Even if it did, what does the discretion of the museum do for some teach ers? To take a safe example (for me): anyone who has seen my father-in-law Daniel Boyarin in person knows that he cannot walk into a classroom and appear to be discreet from his Judaism. Even if he could "pass," he would not, for instance, teach a class on Yom Kippur in order to "remain within, and respect the protocols of the silent museum" or perform his commitment to academic "spaces of adiaphora" (Simpson 144, 158). This is true whether he is teaching Paul or Aristotle or an introduction to rhetoric. It is, even, a crucial lesson for his students Jewish or otherwise) to see that he does not need to be thus discreet.4 This is also Shawkat Toorawa's point when he imagines freedom from such discretion, even though he is an "observed-to be-observant Muslim": "Maybe I want my colleagues, my students, even our teenage daughters, to see that it is absolutely, utterly, and serenely possible to have devotion and be a serious and successful scholar of Arabic litera ture" (168). The problem with the academy-as-museum and text-as-artifact metaphors, in other words, is that they incidentally make neutralized objects of some professors and students too, for not everyone can stand unmarked in the silence. Or, as Carol Duncan has put it in her work on museums and ritual, "What we see and do not see...is closely linked to larger questions about who constitutes the community and who defines its identity" (9). The museum in fact highlights not only what but who is marked and privileges those who are not. Ifear that its silence is a pernicious one. What Museum Studies Knows My point in telling three stories at once is not to ignore the passage of time but rather to dwell on it, to see what's remembered and what's forgotten, what's kept and what's lost. (Lepore 18)5 We arc insufficiently attuned to the religious facets of museums not because too few examples exist but perhaps because of the specious modernization-secularization theories that have for too long drawn a clear line demarcating the secular (museums) from the religious (temples and monasteries) and because of a reluctance to account for the persistence of religion in the modern world. (Robson 128)6 As medievalists know that universities have their origins in the monasteries of western Europe, scholars of the museum know that "[mjuseums have</page><page sequence="8">FORUM 233 served the interests of modern nation-states" (Robson 127). They work with "inherited sociopolitical contradictions.. .which in part grow out of a struggle over the organization of time and history" (Barndt 135). They are troubled places of cultural interaction, where the neutrality of any object may be questioned or removed at any time, where curated spaces create their own narratives and effect their own conscious and unconscious exclu sions, as Alyssa McLeod and Danica Boyce emphasize above.7 Of course. Valéry eventually "broke off his reflections" on the museum because of his certainty that its objects were "borrowed from the past and yet inadequate to it": always already segmented from their past, the museum's objects, "even if they hung in their old places in castles.. .would be museum pieces without museums" (Adorno 185, 184). Mark O'Neill has lamented the "very British Museum" ideal that still pertains in the world's great museums, which "aspire to be detached, academic, decontextualized and hierarchical, to be outside time, history and politics, and to privilege Western aesthetic over other non-rational meanings, be they cultural, emotional or spiritual" (197). In the "universal museum" that they now strive to be, this aspiration is too often an argument against repatriation, and the goal of impartiality might be better served by "seeing how cultures change, evolve, conflict and intermingle, while at the same time retaining deep continuities" ( 199, 200).8 Both synchronic and diachronic approaches to history and its artefacts are insufficient to the interpretive and educative task, and this is as much a scholarly problem as a "real world" one. More than the relevance of religious identity or the question of whether belief hamstrings a scholar's critical faculties or pedagogical authority—and in a interesting move backwards, toward the Watson-Simpson dialogue that created the title of Kerby-Fulton and Jonathan Juilfs's special issue to begin with—we are debating commitments to temporalities. While our dominant metaphor has set certain temporalities (past/present, medieval/modern, synchronic/diachronic) in opposition, these are entirely different from the sort that ask us to do the experiment of thinking The Book of Margery Kempe through Pentecostalism, or to be mindful of "modern Jewish scholarly as sumptions about the prevalence of martyrdom" when reading medieval Jewish lament (Kerby-Fulton, "Something Fearful" 7; Einbinder). We ought to know this. As Carolyn Dinshaw puts it, "multiple temporalities are not unusual in the medieval context" (110). Medievalists know, especially, about the meeting of sacred and secular time. We know what it looks like when "past-present-future times are collapsed into a very capacious now" (109). The results are destabilizing, even queer (as Dinshaw's account of Mar gery Kempe's temporalities, and her own), or they are ugly and violent (as ritual-murder or host-desecration libels that imagine Jews stuck in a kind</page><page sequence="9">234 Religion &lt;T Literature of groundhog-day repetition of the same misread event, and as American politicians' labeling Islamic fundamentalists "medieval" after 9/11), or they are aesthetically pleasing and moving (think "Nou goth sonne under wode," or, in a different register, Donne's "Good Friday, 1613. Riding Westward").9 A scholar committed to "a history that reckons in the most expansive way possible with how people exist in time" and thereby "raises the question of embodiment and subjectivity" (Dinshaw 109), however, is distinct from the scholar-turned-hamstrung-believer who might open a portal to a pre modern world that can "conduct itself only by violence" (Simpson 157). I am not sure if any contributors to R&amp;L 42.1-2 would say they are doing "queer history," as Dinshaw defines this kind of commitment in her own work, but what she describes is much closer to their commitments than are the atemporal insinuations that we might as easily be discussing "fairies at the bottom of garden" and accreted "bundle [s] of beliefs" (Mann 126), or cartoonishly waving a "red cape" while checking a belief-labeled box (not the "scholar" box!) on some imaginary document (Bryan 149). The problems inherent in temporal dichotomies and progressive or universalizing notions of history and knowledge have long been apparent in cultural studies and theory (Latour is particularly effective on modernity and belief, Judith Butler on universalism, Meike Bal on the semiotics of the museum), as they have been in non-Christian reckonings of the self in time. Jewish and other read ers might want to dwell, for good historical and personal reasons, on "both the howling gap between us and the past and the past's proximity to us" J. Boyarin xvi, my emphasis). This is in order to place "imperial elites and the cultures of those marginalized by world-systematic domination (the majority of humanity) within the same power-laden field" (xv), and explicitly not to limit the purview of scholarship to those who are the same, or to normatized voices or silences. A "collective through continuity (coextension in time)" might even hold the potential to correct the now thoroughly problematized "modern notion of solidarity" through space (nation, museum, temple) that is indeed complicit in so much religious and secular violence and exclusion (xvii).10 We have in hand another tool for theorizing what Theresa Coletti calls "the larger project of understanding the past in contemporary practice of the human sciences" (205). Coletti is insightful in her realization that the "focus on religious belief" in R&amp;L 42.1-2 and its response forum reflects not a dangerous bogey man of the cognitive past (is it not people like the Qur'an-burning pastor Terry Jones that we are actually afraid of?), but rather a timely focus on "contemporary conversations about temporalities and postmodern epistemologies" (196).11 We have here "important oppor</page><page sequence="10">FORUM 235 tunities for inter-disciplinary exchange" (205). Coletti cites the 2011 PMLA cluster "The Clash of Religions" as a case in point, but a year earlier, a PMLA "Theories and Methodologies" group on museum studies was work ing on similar issues. In theorizing the viewer-object-space relations of the museum (and critically informed by her research on German Holocaust and landscape museums), Kerstin Barndt suggests there an eye to history that emphasizes "overlapping relations among semiautonomous layers of time.. .national and global time, flat and deep time, or natural and human time," even though this would mean "abandon [ing] concepts of historical totality and teleology" and therefore would raise new questions about "how historical representations gain legitimacy or social relevance" (137-38, 139). But this may be, too, a move toward a historical awareness that is "radically open, contingent, and revisionist in a positive sense" (Barndt 139). If revi sion can be construed not as a problem (with all the negative connotations of the term "revisionist history") but really as a process of re-seeing, and openness not as a condition of impartiality but really as a willingness to hear autonomous voices and entertain multiple aesthetics, we may get closer to what I know are our shared aspirations. The utility of our dominant metaphor, then, is in its prodding us to think on (not imitate) the museum, its history, and its questions. What Kathryn Kerby-Fulton originally asked of us was "an enlargement of ideas of 'com mitted scholarship'" around: 1. how to realize or even just handle the language of belief in modern scholarly discourse responsibly; 2. how modern continuities of religious practice can cast unexpected light (cognitive, intellectual or spiritual) backwards upon historical sources or problems (we usually think of knowledge as moving the other direction) and our assumptions about them. ("Something" 6) Through our ruminations on museums and temporalities, perhaps we have found a beginning. But the ongoing conversation will depend on the noisy neutrality of the classroom and on a fearless will to confront the influences and blind spots of past and present commitments in our students (who ideally are the involved everyone) and in ourselves. This is, after all, how we grow, as scholars and as persons. The conversation cannot work amidst suspicion of the invisible "believers among us" who may see the academy/museum as "a betrayal of belief" (Simpson 157, 143). I would be exhausted by the sheer need to neutralize things—and I would not like my students to see the academy, nor the world, this way. Neutralization is not a neutral posture. Likely the only academy where this helps us is the figurai one that is an</page><page sequence="11">236 Religion de Literature Enlightenment museum. Museums might belong on campus, but neither the classroom nor the scholar's study is a museum. Thank God. University of Victoria NOTES 1. My thanks to my additional interlocutors in this debate: Daniel Boyarin, Kathryn Kerby-Fulton, Christopher Douglas, Iain Higgins, Robert Miles, and Stephen Ross—and especially J. Allan Mitchell, ever a trusted sounding board. He will recognize his insights embedded throughout. 2. Benjamin derives this from Paul Klee's 1920 watercolor "Angelus Novus." In a some what fanciful reading of the angelic figure that in fact faces the viewer, he sees "the angel of history" who is "fixedly contemplating" something behind him, while a "storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned" (257-58). In dialogue with Simpson's view of reform violence and Susan Einbinder's critique of Jewish historiography in her R&amp;L 42.1-2 contribution, Benjamin's angel has been understood as a figure of Jewish traumatic memory. See Jonathan Boyarin's introduction to his Storm from Paradise, especially xiv-xvii. 3. My thanks to Gaelan Gilbert for pointing me towards Latour's 2010 On the Modern Cult of the Factish Gods, and for sharing with me his related unpublished work on the place of personification allegory in theorized medieval/modern divisions. 4. Daniel and Jonathan Boyarin have thematized precisely this position in "Self-Exposure as Theory: The Double Mark of the Male Jew." 5. Jill Lapore's work on the incoherence of the Tea Party's use of the past to harness political and economic frustrations argues in part that such incoherence arises when schol ars and educators avoid explicit and critical discussion of past-present continuities and discontinuities. 6. James Robson is part of the PMLA group on museum studies I mention below. Though he focuses there on sites in Asia, he is generally interested in how museums and museum literature treat religious objects and sites (121-23). In this he follows Duncan, but his introduction and works cited also bring into relief the difference in Western and non Western approaches: there is a "profound sense of disconnect...between the literature on museums that has developed and proliferated in Euro-American academic circles and the development of museum practices in Asia" (122). 7. Turkey's recent efforts to reclaim artefacts it claims were stolen or looted during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries pertain, as do various Canadian legislative acts in recent decades that attempt to accommodate requests for the return of First Nations sacred and ceremonial objects from museums. See Bilefsky and Fisher respectively. We should be mind ful, also, that object neutrality can be removed in multiple ways. Kerby-Fulton makes the point above, citing prayer before objects at the National Gallery and at a 2009 Walters Art Museum exhibit (218-19), and the Museum of Vancouver's 2012 return of a petroglyph to the Stswecem'c Xgat'tem Nation is an interesting case too: the rock was placed back into the British Columbia landscape (Churn Creek), amidst ceremonial blessings, celebration, and anxiety over rival claims. See Seidl and Waugh. 8. O'Neill, former head of Glasgow museums and current director of policy for the</page><page sequence="12">FORUM 237 Glasgow Life public cultural group, responds specifically to the 2002 Declaration (to which the "big five" museums were signatories), that "the great museums of the world...are universal institutions whose displays enable visitors 'to see the world as one'" (190). He is particularly critical of the British Museum's deployment of this document as an argument against ongoing repatriation requests, and traces its arrogance to what he sees as outmoded notions of the Enlightenment museum. O'Neill continues to be a critic of the museum sector: his keynote address at the November 2012 Museums Association conference in Edinburgh explored "where museums stand in the struggle for social justice and question [ed] their commitment to access" (Kendall). 9. See Holsinger for a discussion of post-9/11 labelling of Islamic fundamentalists. 10. I am applying this more generally than does Jonathan Boyarin in his work, but it is not incidental to our discussion that Jonathan's reading means to offer an alternative to Zionism, an ethical "ethnic strategy that need not impinge on the autonomy of others" (xvii). 11. I borrow the term "cognitive past" from Gaelan Gilbert's lecture "Notes Toward a History of Anthropomorphism": Gaelan proposes that a "modern misrecognition of the analytic potency of medieval personification allegory...has a resonant analogue in the nineteenth-century characterization of non-Western religion as simplistically anthropomor phic. In both cases, modern thinkers perform a similar sort of conceptual colonization, in one case over the medieval past and, in the other, over those non-Westerners whose religious consciousness was treated as the equivalent of a cognitive past, at least when compared with the Enlightened West" (my emphasis).
