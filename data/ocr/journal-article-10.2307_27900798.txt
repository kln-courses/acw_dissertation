<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONSERVATION OF VALUES IN THE UNIVERSE. ITHINK it would be true to say that in all recent philos ophy there is an undertone of pessimism, if only in the sense that even its professed optimism appears compelled to struggle to maintain and justify itself. The triumphs of mind, since the Renaissance shattered the midnight of the Dark Ages?the splendid conquests of science?have pro duced (if we go beneath the surface of popular thinking) a strange aftermath, inasmuch as they have deposed man from the age-old throne where as a e ?"a little lower than the angels"?he ruled for ancient thought. And the Copernican revolution, even as counterbalanced by its philosophic analog, seems to have given humanity, the puny and transient offspring of eternal galaxies, its final and proper status ; for which the despair of Schopenhauer, or the dogmatic of Omar,1 appears the fittest philosophy. So that to idealism or monism it seems a paradox equally sad as strange, that the more complex is always the more restricted, the higher is also the rarer: the sim pler physical forces are interplanetary in their range, the living cell is microscopic ; barbarism appears immortal, art and knowledge transient?unless we are to find consola tion in the thought that "a century of Europe's worth a cycle of Cathay." And if philosophy is thus at the best dubious, science 1 "One thing is certain-"7-Cf. also a recent expression of this stand point in Bertrand Russell's Mysticism and Logic, pp. 47-48.</page><page sequence="2">204 THE MONIST. seems sufficiently definite?only with an adverse verdict; for the opinion is widely held that owing to the final "de gradation" of universal energy into the form of heat, all change and development without exception must ultimately cease.2 And certainly, if these impressions and conclusions are really well founded, it is difficult to regard intelligence or spirit as in any real sense determining the course of things, for its activity can be regarded only as in the end a failure, or, what is worse, a mockery. Life, mind, and culture be come epiphenomena which revert to the dead matter from which they first arose. The universe, in spite of its marvel, would lack purpose and completion. For, we must note, it is the development of these highest values?of science, art, morality, religion?and their destruction that contra dict true purpose and end?not any running down of the physical cycle in itself; for that, after all, might be the inevitable end of no matter how vast and wonderful a mechanism. But that the growth of reason and esthetic, the freedom of the moral agent in his choice between right and wrong, the tragic conflicts of national ideals?that these "shall dissolve.... leave not a rack behind"?this, to reason itself, must ever remain repugnant and incom prehensible. But I venture to think that in this respect philosophy, at least if it merit the name idealistic or monistic, may be less hesitant and more positive; and basing itself on the principle of the systematically unified nature of reality, may endeavor to prove that although higher values must neces sarily be rare and restricted in range, nevertheless the universal change must inevitably result in the long run in the development of values which become continuously higher and higher without assignable limit: so that the 2 For the consideration of the scientific aspects of this belief I may refer to Science Progress, No. 50, Oct., 1918, pp. 310-311.</page><page sequence="3">THE CONSERVATION OF VALUES IN THE UNIVERSE. 205 ultimate retrogression which physical science regards as possible becomes philosophically wholly untenable; and alongside the scientific principle of the Conservation of Energy must be posited its philosophical counterpart?the Conservation of Value. 2. It is often objected, however, against philosophical arguments in general, that they set out from unanalyzed assumptions, which being shown to be ill founded, invali date the supposed conclusion; and too often this defect must be admitted. But in postulating here the systematic unity of reality, the only principle employed is that which forms the basis of science itself, so far as this demands uniformity and law. For law can only be universal, if the reality whose nature it reveals or interprets be systematic, interconnected, or interrelated throughout its whole extent. Universal law in scientific thought must be based on uni versal connection in real existence. And while both are ideals, still they stand or fall together, so that to question our initial principle is at the same time to impugn the basis of all modern science. For the progress of scientific knowledge is sporadic and fitful only to a casual view. In reality, the enunciation of every new law affects the whole body of law previously ascertained, and has its due effect in determining later discoveries ; and this increasingly with each new advance,3 so that it is becoming more and more difficult to specialize very strictly : every new law of importance throws its light on wider and wider groups of phenomena, and is applicable to more numerous cases.4 Therefore to assert that the unity of reality is sys tematic?interconnected?is also on the one hand to ex 3 Just as, e. g., the organism is permanently affected to some degree by every stimulus; or national law by all new legislation. 4 The influence of the discovery of radio-activity on the theory of the constitution of matter is a recent instance; cf. again the principle of natura? selection.</page><page sequence="4">2 6 THE MONIST. elude an impossible homogeneity plainly incompatible with system, and on the other to admit a practical or limited pluralism, in so far as this demands substantial hetero geneity without ultimate disconnection. For though mo nism is a principle which can neither be finally proved nor yet wholly dispensed with, still it does not forbid the de marcation of the whole into distinct regions with which thought can deal in separate sciences ; and from this point of view philosophy must always remain scientia scien Harum. Another facile objection to the "philosophy of value" is akin to that so often leveled against religious ideas? that of undue anthropomorphism. "Value," it may be urged, must in the end resolve into value for our thought,5 and therefore its standard and sanction can never be ob jective and ultimate; it must (the analogous arguments in ethics will be familiar) always be unstable, varying with each new age's experience and outlook; "value" is essen tially a conception at once subjective and temporal, rather than objective and eternal; it is a Zeitgeist rather than a Weltgeist. But while to this point of view must be con ceded its due importance, still to insist upon it as final is to overemphasize what is merely an aspect inseparable from all our experience. For in so far as the mind's activity enters into the structure of all knowledge without any dis tinction whatever, this defect of subjectivity (if it be a defect) invalidates all our conceptions equally, and not only those of religion, morality, and value.6 With these all our esthetic and scientific ideas alike are nullified,7 and thought in brief is simply asked to commit suicide; which fatality, 8 I should like to refer to Dr. Bosanquet's treatment of this point in The Principle of Individuality and Value, Lect. VIII. 6 Of course, if it is said that these are in the end identical, I should agree ; only not before the end. 7 This argument of course is familiar ; but I think that their common basis should be an equal certainty rather than dubiety.</page><page sequence="5">THE CONSERVATION OF VALUES IN THE UNIVERSE. if really inevitable, had best occur at the earliest possible moment. 3. But thought is in no predicament of this kind, even though, so slow and tortuous is its advance,8 the idea is equally natural as deceptive. On the contrary, it surely requires little insight to recognize definite positive progress in our thinking on art, ethics, and religion; in science of course indubitably so; but science is not an activity of the mind peculiarly free from defects which are supposed to vitiate all its other manifestations. Modern thought is something more than the mere successor of previous specu lation?it is also its heir, enriched by its bequests and warned by its errors, and lamentably faulty as are our moral theory and social organization, still their tone and tendency are infinitely better than the polished barbarism of pagan and medieval Europe.9 To say, therefore, that our recognition (or even construction) of value-concepts has an inherent subjective element need not prevent our also regarding them as representing valid objective char acters of ultimate reality. We must next accord some degree at least of reality to time and change, without, however, attempting to deter mine their ultimate status. Whatever difficulties may at tend any conception of a real which changes and endures, the world we know is certainly unintelligible apart from these attributes, even if it therefore be no more than ap pearance. It then appears to me that with regard to real ity as thus characterized it can be shown, through the analysis of its systematic nature, that a. All high values must be rare and restricted; 8 "And not through Eastern windows only-" 9 In spite of the high level attained by ethical speculation among the Greeks, their actual heartlessness, e. g., in the Peloponnesian War (probably as a result of their earlier migrations) is very remarkable, and the arguments by which it was supported strikingly similar to those employed by modern German dip lomats and historians.</page><page sequence="6">2 8 THE MONIST. b. They are all possible only against a basis or back ground of lower values; c. But that all change, taken as a whole, must neces sarily result in the production of individuals whose value becomes increasingly higher without limit ; the last being obviously the most important. 4. Some little technicality is unavoidable, and perhaps it is best to consider a little more fully what is involved in regarding reality as being systematically at once both diverse and unified. I have referred already to the indispensability of this conception as being the sole valid basis for universal law of whatever category?scientific, economic, or moral; and also to the practicability of reconciling within its limits the apparently opposed standpoints of monism and plural ism. These, however, are general principles, regulating the idea in its more or less formal aspect; and it seems further possible to give it a more concrete and detailed form. Scientific classification,10 although its classes are cer tainly unities, must begin by isolation and abstraction, and always retains some of the characteristics of its origin. But while classes remain merely classes, or types, it is plainly impossible to build up from them any true world; to do this we must return to those individual objects them selves from which (by abstraction) our classes were first of all formed. Perhaps an illustration may make this point clearer. The greatest novelists and dramatists differ from their less able fellows, in that, while the latter present to us what are, even at their best, only various types of human ity, the masters themselves create characters?persons?as actual and individual as living people.11 For only thus can 10 Really all classification, which, however, has reached its highest devel opment in science. II Thus Ibsen constructed in its remotest branches the life-history of his characters before writing anything of the play.</page><page sequence="7">THE CONSERVATION OF VALUES IN THE UNIVERSE. 20? the imaginative world be given the vivid actuality of the real, and peopled with the immortals of fiction and the drama ; while more commonplace efifort can succeed in re producing no more (at best) than well-drawn types of humanity at large. And philosophy may claim, though certainly in no depreciatory spirit, that some degree of analogy to this exists between its own task and that of science. For taking advantage of the indispensable pre liminary classificatory work of science, philosophy seeks to return to the individual object or thing; but not, however, to this in itself simply, but rather as it must now be under stood and reinterpreted in the light of scientific research upon it and its fellows. For to classify is plainly to bring a thing into some degree of relation with other things, more or less similar to itself. This is scientific procedure; from which philosophy differs only in carrying the same process farther, and so seeking to relate the object truly to the universe?to assign to it its due place and value within the Whole. It is true that philosophy here under takes a task which to human intelligence is impossible in full concrete detail, for every object, even the apparently most trivial, is really unique and inexhaustible.12 But in principle nevertheless the work is feasible and indeed ob ligatory; so that it remains to attempt a brief outline of some of the results of this distinctively philosophic view of the world. Every thing or object then is, when taken in its fullest nature, in the first place unique ; and secondly it is always a system, more or less complex as the case maybe; i.e., in no actual instance do we ever have absolute simplicity or 12 Cf. Tennyson's "Flower in the crannied wall-"; and contrast with Wordsworth's "A primrose by a river's brim A yellow primrose was to him, And it was nothing more." The class or type, however high its value for knowledge, is always in some degree abstract and artificial; and no one would maintain (I suppose) the actual existence of any class strictly as such.</page><page sequence="8">2IO THE MONIST. homogeneity and total absence of systematic structure, for this conception again is only attained by the abstraction and isolation of thought. But the term "unique" here is capa ble of two very different and indeed opposed meanings, according as it does, or does not, connote a total absence of connection with all other objects, for to be truly unique, an object should stand absolutely alone and severed from all else. But this of course is never the case; so that to say that every object is for philosophic thought "unique" means that, while only itself has all its attributes, still it maintains close connection with, and relation to, its en vironment. But "environment," again, may have a mean ing as wide, or as narrow, as we choose to give it. Usually its meaning is comparatively restricted, because to deter mine an object's relation to its immediate environment is amply sufficient for ordinary knowledge and scientific pur poses. But any limits thus given to "environment" are plainly more or less artificial, are merely matters of con venience. As knowledge increases, so does the meaning of "environment" expand, until it becomes, for knowledge at its widest, nothing less than the universe as a whole? "....all in all, 'T should know what God and man is." The ideal of philosophy, then, is to comprehend the uni verse as a complex of interrelated individual systems, and each individual again as connected with, and in its nature expressive of, the rest of the Whole outside of itself. It must follow therefore that no characteristic or at tribute whatever of any object (or system) is ever really negligible and purposeless ; but rather every feature therein without exception, when thoroughly understood, indicates some definite connection or relation with the universe at large?i. e., with spheres of environment more and more remote without assignable limit.</page><page sequence="9">THE CONSERVATION OF VALUES IN THE UNIVERSE. 211 But there are at the same time differences or gradations in this aspect between these attributes when taken in any given complex ; the fundamental distinction,18 which lies at the root of all others, being given by the extent of the environment to which any given attribute relates and con nects the system in question. The distinction, e. g., between primary and secondary qualities14 is as familiar as it is puzzling. But as a general principle, primary attributes relate a system to the widest possible environment?its weight, e. g., to the whole of the material universe?while all past changes have combined to impress upon it its figure.18 Secondary qualities, again, maintain connection with a more restricted and specialized environment; while this is yet more the case if the tertiary (e. g., esthetic or moral) and higher qualities are considered.16 In short (to repeat), every attribute connects its system to a sector, wider or narrower as the case may be, of the whole possible environment.17 It is only when this principle has been grasped that we may be said to have attained a truly philo sophic apprehension of any given system, as distinguished from a scientific understanding of it, which must always select and emphasize some particular environment and re lations. And while all monism or idealism demands this universal connection, rational monism requires that it be thus systematically ordered and graded; while pluralism contents itself with merely limited views, which may, how ever, be the best in practice for given special purposes. 18 Not, however, the only distinction, for there are always others more obvious and practical, which depend upon and are abstractions from the under lying distinction here indicated. 14 This is the usual division, which seems, however, to lack philosophic justification; for we may if we choose add tertiary and quaternary. 16 Its bare existence (regarding this as a real attribute) relates it to every other existent without exception. 16These obviously relate entities to mind; whether this holds true of all existente is, of course, a familiar problem. 17 Cf. again the "natural rights" which every one is supposed to enjoy, with the special claims and duties imposed by a definite status in a well-ordered society, and exemplified, e. g., during the War.</page><page sequence="10">212 THE MONIST. I think that this monistic or idealistic principle plainly holds true of every static system, whose equilibrium indeed consists essentially in this relation, at once universal and diversified, between every constituent and the whole; but the universe is dynamic,18 and from this (it appears to me) a further fundamentally important result must logically follow. 5. Every complex system, we have seen, is, in virtue of all its attributes taken together, in connection with wider or narrower regions of the Whole. And further, each of its attributes or properties, considered separately, relates it to as wide an environmental sector as is possible for it to do?each is earmarked, as it were, for this purpose. As a result, every system is connected, in virtue of its complete intrinsic character, with an environment as general and extensive as is possible. Therefore, if we now assume any increase Avhatever in the system's complexity,19 this must take the form of the development of some new character istic, additional to those which it already possesses. But since, further, its existing properties already relate it (as has just been shown) to a range of environment as wide as is possible, the newly developed attribute can connect the system only with some sector of the external whole which is more specialized and restricted than any hitherto ?simply because to all wider sections the system is related already. But in actuality such an increasing complexity is never restricted to one, or to some few systems, but occurs uni versally;19 which universality then implies further, as re gards any given system, that there must be an increasing restriction and specialization on both sides ? both in any 18 Change, whatever the difficulties as to its ultimate reality, was postu lated at the outset (ante). 19 I endeavor to show below that such an increase is something more than a mere assumption, and an actual fact?that it is a necessary feature of the changing Whole.</page><page sequence="11">THE CONSERVATION OF VALUES IN THE UNIVERSE. 213 given system itself, and in the whole of its environment. For every individual?every natural entity?is ( in the first place) specialized in some degree?is a more or less local ized element in the systematic whole. Every advance, therefore, in its complexity, especially when this occurs part passu with a similar advance throughout its environment, must mean constantly higher specialization, and therefore increased localization and restriction?sensitive response to ever narrower and narrower spheres of the environment. And thus the first result which (I think) is directly deducible from our initial principle of the systematic nature of changing reality, is that the highest and most valuable entities in the world (for these are generally the most com plex and specialized)20 are also?necessarily and inevitably ?the rarest and the most restricted, both in occurrence and in range; while on the other hand, the more wide-spread, general, and dififused are any systems, the lower and sim pler must be as a rule their category and value; so that what at first sight certainly appears to be a lack or a posi tive defect in the character of the real is found to be a direct and inevitable result of its inherent and systematic nature. And this view again enables us to perceive the error of antagonizing ? of creating antitheses between ? different categories, which when thus judged by their degrees of complexity and value, are found to be relatively higher and lower. Such false contrasts are those which have been maintained between soul and body, life and matter, citizen and State, religion and morality, and others equally famil iar. It must be ever futile to attempt to "reconcile" these, simply because there is no real opposition between them. Their difiference, which is erroneously regarded as conflict, arises from their respective degrees of complexity and value; and they should no more be opposed to each other 20 But the total effect may nevertheless still be esthetically simple ; this arises from the harmony of the constituents, whose complexity is revealed only through analysis.</page><page sequence="12">214 THE MONIST. than, e. g., the childhood and manhood of a statesman or genius. 6. This leads us to a further consideration, for not only is there no opposition between categories which thus exist at different levels, but there is rather a necessary connec tion between them. That this is so is indeed already to some extent recognized by modern thought, dominated as it is by the conception of evolution, whose lack in earlier times rendered possible the unfounded antagonisms just referred to. But I think philosophy may do more than merely accept the actual fact of evolution, which in itself only constitutes, without at all solving, this problem of the persistence of lowly forms of existence long after the devel opment of more perfect kinds, which would seem to make their predecessors obsolete. We know that vital phenom ena, e.g., occur only with a material substratum, and con sciousness, whatever be the possibility of its occurrence apart from living bodies, is presented to us only in intimate dependence on physiological structure and process. But can we go beyond the mere actuality of these connections, to discover for them some kind of logical necessity? If we return to the fundamental principle of the nature of reality?that it is systematic?I think we can. For if we consider the individual which, at any given moment, has attained and exhibits the highest degree of development hitherto possible, and suppose that it further acquires (from whatever causes) a fresh attribute, so as to become still more complex or "higher," this new char acter, as we have just seen, will relate the system to a part of its environment more restricted than any hitherto, but at the same time, ex hypothesi, less specialized than itself ; and therefore the persistence of this new attribute?i. e., of the whole complex system possessing it?will be possible only while the "lower" environment to which it is now responsive continues in existence. Expressing this as a</page><page sequence="13">THE CONSERVATION OF VALUES IN THE UNIVERSE. 215 general principle then, we may say that every advance in development has been possible only as responsive to, or against, a wider background or basis of systems of lower complexity. The actual extent and diversity of these again have constituted an immense area from which an infinite number of subdivisions has been demarcated, to each of which may then be developed some specialized and respon sive characteristic present in a higher individual or system. Thus the philosophic rationale of entities low in the scale of values would appear to be to regard them as the indis pensable stimuli and determinants of higher and more com plex systems?the physical universe of the living world? the merely vital of the conscious?and our rational facul ties of the moral nature. 7. The final problem to be considered is rather more complex and difficult than the two principles I have endeav ored to establish. We have now to regard the universe as essentially a changing whole, and to inquire,?Is any gen eral character inherent in, and necessary to, its processes of change taken in their entirety??i. e., considered apart from the special details which science is concerned with, and viewed, in virtue of their common (though not equal) contribution to the final result, as all on a par with each other. It is essential here to understand what is the exact purport of the question, for it is generally agreed that as a matter of fact the course of change hitherto has been from the simple to the complex?from "lower" to "higher." But while this is certainly true, still we can find in this fact itself no assurance whatever that future changes will con tinue to pursue this course, so as to bring about still greater complexity and higher values. Indeed, if we must accept the prevalent view of the ultimate "degradation" of all energy, the contrary would appear to be a better founded conclusion. We require, therefore, something more than a</page><page sequence="14">2l6 THE MONIST. proof of the actual fact of evolutionary advance?we must seek to show its inherent and logical necessity in the being and nature of the world?i. e., not only that it actually does take place, but further that it must necessarily do so. We may begin, then, with the principle of the universal connection between cause and effect. If we consider this relation not in any of its particular cases, but as universal, then we are at once led to the familiar conclusion that the real ground, or complete cause, of any given total phase in the world's development, lies in its previous condition also taken as a whole. But this result again is plainly only another aspect of the principle of the systematic?inter related?character of reality, of the changing Whole as exhibiting an individuality which throughout is systematic but always incomplete, for at every moment it is itself the condition of its succeeding phase. Our question thus plainly takes the form: Is there between these succeeding total phases any inherently necessary universal relation? That each is throughout determined by its predecessor is cer tain; can we go farther and ascertain anything equally definite as to the universal mode21 of this determination? If we take into consideration the precise manner in which, in actuality, this universal causal determination always manifests itself, I think we may ? that is, as a sequence or chain of distinguishable causes and effects always in their details (as science has shown) exactly relevant to each other. And therefore in order properly to apprehend the true nature of causal determination, it is necessary to perceive that this has always two distinct aspects, to each of which its due weight must be given. Every separate instance of cause-effect relation, that is, must be considered22 as being essentially one constituent of 211, e., as distinguished from the bare fact. 221, e., from the philosophical standpoint.</page><page sequence="15">THE CONSERVATION OF VALUES IN THE UNIVERSE. 2\J the total causal determination of each phase of the whole by its predecessor ; and to regard it, apart from this, as a phenomenon wholly separate and independent is to make of it merely a false abstraction. Certainly science must, to be successful, lay an emphasis (which is, however, philo sophically illegitimate) on one of these aspects only?i. e., on each separate causal relation as separate; for no experi ment could be attempted were the whole universe con sidered as determining it. But this scientific necessity is a philosophic defect, and from it there arises what is a well recognized fault of causal explanation as generally pre sented? its being always infinitely retrogressive ? even separate cause being only a link in an endless series, and never itself final and complete. But this defect is merely the logical result of the false isolation and narrowness of all scientific causes without exception; it is due to our losing sight of the truth that the only cause which can be truly final is nothing less than the Whole itself. 8. But the assertion that each phase of the universe is determined by its predecessor must obviously mean that every static system23 derives its concrete character from the nature of the Whole, and in this respect itself expresses that nature ; every thing owes its own particular character in the end to the nature of the Whole. The inner structure of every system being the result of all previous changes, its stability and equilibrium must obviously depend upon, and be responsive to, the sum total of its environing con ditions; never for a moment is it severed from and inde pendent of its total environment, which thus determines equally the maintenance, or the cessation, of its static equi librium?i. e., of its persistence as a system (for science) or as an individual (for philosophy). But science is interested, for obvious reasons, rather 28 Which can, of course, be only relatively?never absolutely?static.</page><page sequence="16">2l8 THE MONIST. in the alteration than in the maintenance of equilibrium,24 in change rather than in quiescence; so that it remains to consider the implication of the truth that every change is (not merely a consequence of some prior restricted change but) a response to alteration in the total environment. Only by taking this universal view can we avoid the futile infinite regress which the ordinary cause-effect sequence always involves. If, then, we consider any system S,25 we must recognize, (a) that it has attained its actual concrete structure as a result of all previous change; and (b) that while it retains this structure unaltered, the maintenance of its equilibrium is responsive to the totality of the conditions in its environ ment.26 This being the case, I think it follows quite log ically that when any change to which it is sensitive occurs in its environment, then, since S is ex hypothesi complex, its various parts must respond differentially to the single stimulus from without. We may cite as illustrations crys tallization within a matrix cooling as a whole ; or the effects upon a nation of a declaration of war. But this differential response really means that there arise within S new subordinate systems which (although S was already systematic) did not exist, as such new sys tems, before; and this results, necessarily, in an advance in the systematization of S?in its increased specialization and heterogeneity. 24 But the less so as science becomes more concrete ; while still higher levels of culture?history, art, religion?are concerned with complex and stable systems as such. 25 Which must always have some degree, high or low, of complexity ; and also if the system remains a system in spite of change, some potentiality; this latter condition excludes from consideration all destructive change, which, however, comes indirectly within the scope of the argument. 26 This principle tends to be left out of account, or at least fails to receive due emphasis, in two respects, (1) we regard change, rather than quiescence, as responsive to stimulus, and (2) we relate every system to too narrow and limited an environment; its real environment being nothing less than the Whole.</page><page sequence="17">the conservation of values in the universe. 2i? And such an advance, again, must be continuous with out any assignable limits, for three reasons : ( ) the stimuli which affect every actual system are many and varied, and each of them contributes its quota to the final compound result; but (2) what is still more important, as new sys tems originate within S, every further change within S is to some degree a change outside each of these, and so tends to induce within these still further systematization and complexity, ad infinitum; and finally (3), S itself must affect reflexly its own environing systems ; what are effects within S become causes outside it; for it is itself part of some environment, so that the higher complexity induced within passes outward again and brings about correlative responsive advances in systems outside itself.27 Thus we appear to have proved that since the universe is systematic throughout?is interrelated, interconnected, and everywhere governed by law?therefore a continuous advance in complexity, in heterogeneity, in value, is (not only actual but) logically inevitable and necessary. All the diverse values of the universe, of whatever kind, are thus conserved and increased; all destruction really sub serves reconstruction; and though this principle in itself may not be sufficient to prove indubitably that the Whole is swayed by Mind or Spirit or Personality, still it does (I think) enable philosophy to refuse to entertain pessimis tic views as to the future of mankind and the world.
