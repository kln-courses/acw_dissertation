The chief difficulty which most persons find in accepting the Doctrine of Evolution, as applied to the origin of the human race, is the difficulty of realizing in imagination the kinship between the higher and- the lower forms of intelligence and emotion. And this difficulty is enhanced by a tendency of which our daily associations make it hard to rid ourselves. This is a tendency to exaggerate the contrasts which really exist, by leaving out of mind the intermediate phenomena and considering only the extremes. Many critics, both among those who are hostile to the Development Theory and among those who regard it with favor, habitually argue as if the intelligence and morality of the human race might be fairly represented by the intelligence and morality of a minority of highly organized * In thus publishing as an independent article what is really a fragmentary por tion of an integral work, I have unavoidably been compelled to make occasional reference to arguments contained in other chapters of the work, the full force of which, therefore, will not be here apparent.

When speaking of mankind they are speaking of tbat which is represented to their imagination by the small numb?r of up right, cultivated, and well-bred people with whom they are directly acquainted, and also to some extent by a few of those quite exceptional men and women who have left names recorded in history. Though other elements are admitted into the con ception, these are, nevertheless, the ones which chiefly give to it its character. Employing then this conception of mankind, ab stracted from these inadequate instances, our critics ask us how it is possible to imagine that a race possessed of such a godlike intellect, such a keen aesthetic sense, and such a lofty soul should ever have descended from a race of mere brutes. And again they ask us how can a race endowed with such a capacity for progress be genetically akin to those lower races of which even the highest show no advance from one genera tion to another. Confronted thus by difficulties which reason and imagination seem alike incompetent to overcome, they too often either give up the problem as insoluble, or else ? which amounts to nearly the same thing ? have recourse to the deus ex machina as an aid in solving it. Influenced, no doubt, by some such mental habit as this, Mr. St. George Mivart declares that, while thoroughly agree ing with Mr. Darwin as to man's zoological position, he never theless regards the difference between ape and mushroom as less important than the difference between ape and man, so soon as we take into the account " the totality of man's being." (Nature, April 20,1871.) In this emphatic statement there is a certain amount of truth, though Mr. Mivart is not justified, in implying that it is a truth which the Darwinian is bound not to recognize. The enormous difference between civilized man and the highest of brute animals is by no one more emphati cally recognized than by the evolutionist, who holds that to the process of organic development there has been superadded a stupendous process of social development, and who must there fore admit that with the beginning of human civilization there was opened a new chapter in the history of the universe, so far as we know it. Prom the human point of view we may con tentedly grant that, for all practical purposes, the difference</page><page sequence="3">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 253 between an ape and a mushroom is of less consequence than the difference between an ape and an educated European of the nineteenth century. But to take this educated European as a typical sample of mankind, and to contrast him directly with chimpanzees and gibbons, is in the highest degree falla cious; since the proceeding involves the omission of a host of facts which, when taken into account, must essentially modify the aspect of the whole case. When we take the refined and intellectual Teuton, with his one hundred and fourteen cubic inches of brain, and set him alongside of the chimpanzee with his thirty-five cubic inches of brain, the difference seems so enormous as to be incompatible with any original kinship. But when we interpose the Austra lian, whose brain, measuring seventy cubic inches, comes con siderably nearer to that of the chimpanzee than to that of the Teuton, the case is entirely altered, and we are no longer in clined to admit sweeping statements about the immeasurable superiority of man, which we may still admit, provided they are restricted to civilized man. If we examine the anatomical composition of these brains, the discovery that in structural complexity the Teutonic cerebrum surpasses the Australian even more than the latter surpasses that of the chimpanzee, serves to strengthen us in our position. And when we pass from facts of anatomy to facts of psychology, we obtain still further confirmation ; for we find that the difference in structure is fully paralleled by the difference in functional manifestation. If the Englishman shows such wonderful command of relations of space, time, and number as to be able to tell us that to an observer stationed at Greenwich on the 7th of June, A. D. 2004, at precisely nine minutes and fifty-six seconds after five o'clock in the morning, Venus will begin to cross the sun's disk, the Australian, on the other hand, is able to count only up to five or six, and cannot tell us the number of fingers on his two hands, since so large a number as ten excites in him only an indefinite impression of plurality.* Our conception of * The Dammaras, according to Mr. Galton, are even worse off than this. " When they wish to express four, they take to their fingers, which are to them as formida ble instruments of calculation as a sliding rule is to an English school-boy. They puzzle very much after five, because no spare hand remains to grasp and secure the</page><page sequence="4">254 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. the godlike intellect evidently will not apply here. If the emotions of the German and his intellectual perceptions of the fitness of harmonious sounds for expressing emotion are so deep and subtile and varied as to result in the production of choruses like those of Handel and symphonies like those of Beethoven, the crude emotions of the Australian, on the other hand, are quite adequately expressed by the discordant yells and howls which constitute the sole kind of music appreciable by his undeveloped ears. We look in vain here for traces of the keen aesthetic sense which in a measure links together our intellectual and moral natures. Again, if the American stu dent has been known to be actuated by such noble ethical im pulses and guided by such lofty conceptions of morality as to leave his comfortable home and his favorite pursuits, and en gage in rough warfare, at the risk of life and limb, solely or chiefly that he might assist in relieving the miseries of far inferior men, whose direct claim upon his personal sympathies fingers that are required for units. Yet they seldom lose oxen ; the way in which they discover the loss of one is not by the number of the herd being diminished, but by the absence of a face they know. When bartering is going on, each sheep must be paid for separately. Thus, suppose two sticks of tobacco to be the rate of exchange for one sheep, it would sorely puzzle a Dammara to take two sheep and give him four sticks. I have done so, and seen a man put two of the sticks apart, and take a sight over them at one of the sheep he was about to sell. Having satisfied himself that that one was honestly paid for, and finding to his surprise that exactly two sticks remained in hand to settle the account for the other sheep, he would be afflicted with doubts ; the transaction seemed to come out too 'pat ' to be correct, and he would refer back to the first couple of sticks ; and then his mind got hazy and confused, and wandered from one sheep to the other, and he broke off the transaction until two sticks were put into his hand, and one sheep driven away, and then the other two sticks given him, and the second sheep driven away. Once while I watched a Dammara floundering hopelessly in a calculation on one side of me, I observed Dinah, my spaniel, equally embarrassed on the other. She was overlooking half a dozen of her new-born puppies, which had been removed two or three times from her, and her anxiety was excessive, as she tried to find out if they were all present, or if any were still missing. She kept puzzling and running her eyes over them, backwards and forwards, but could not satisfy herself. She evi dently had a vague notion of counting, but the figure was too large for her brain. Taking the two as they stood, dog and Dammara, the comparison reflected "no great honor on the man." ?

For although, like some brute animals, he is not wholly destitute of the feelings which underlie them, yet these feelings are so seldom repeated in his expe rience that he is unable to generalize from them. The lofty soul, which is too sweepingly attributed to man in distinction from other animals, is here as difficult to discover as the god like intellect or the keen aesthetic sense. In similar wise is made to disappear the sharp contrast be tween human and brute animals in capability of progress. Hardly any fact is more imposing to the imagination than the fact that each generation of men is perceptibly more enlight ened than the preceding one, while each generation of brutes exactly resembles those which have come before it. But the contrast is obtained only by comparing the civilized European of to-day directly with the brute animals known to us through the short period of recorded human history. The capability of progress, however, is by no means shared alike by all races of men. Of the numerous races historically known to us, it has been manifested in a marked degree only by two, ? the Aryan and Semitic. To a much less conspicuous extent it has been exhibited by the Chinese and Japanese, the Copts of Egypt, and a few of the highest American races. On the other hand, the small-brained races ? the Australians and Papuans, the Hot tentots, and the majority of tribes constituting the wide-spread Malay and American families ? appear almost wholly incapa ble of progress, even under the guidance of higher races. The most that can be said for them is, that they are somewhat more imitative and somewhat more teachable than any brute animals. In the presence of the Aryan, even under the most favorable circumstances, they tend to become extinguished, rather than to appropriate the results of a civilization which there is no reason to suppose they could ever have originated. The two great races of Middle Africa, the Negroes and Kaffirs, have shown, by their ability to endure slave labor, their superiority to those above mentioned ; but their career, where it has not been interfered with by white men, has been but little less</page><page sequence="6">256 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. monotonous than the career of a brute species. Of all these barbarian races, we commonly say that they have no history ; and by this we mean that throughout long ages they have made no appreciable progress. In a similar sense we should say of a race of monkeys or elephants, that it has no history. Of like import is the fact, that as we go backward in time we find the progressiveness of the civilized races continually diminishing. No previous century ever saw anything approach ing to the increase in social complexity which has been wrought in America and Europe since 1789. In science and in the in dustrial arts the change has been greater than in the ten pre ceding centuries taken together. Contrast the seventeen cen turies which it took to remodel the astronomy of Hipparchus with the forty years which it has taken to remodel the chemis try of Berzelius and the biology of Cuvier. Note how the law of gravitation was nearly a century in getting generally accept ed by foreign astronomers,* while within half a dozen years from its promulgation, Darwinism became the accepted creed of the great majority of naturalists. How small the difference between the clumsy wagons of the Tudor period and the mail coach in which our grandfathers rode, compared to the differ ence between the mail-coach and the railway train ! How enor mous the revolution in philosophic thinking since the time of the Encyclop?distes, in comparison with the slow changes which occurred between the epoch of Aristotle and the epoch of Des cartes ! In morality, both individual and national, and in gen eral humanity of disposition and refinement of manners, the in creased rapidity of change has been no less marked. But these considerations are immensely increased in force when we take into account thos,e epochs which, in the light of our present knowledge, can alone properly be termed ancient. Far beyond the comparatively recent period at which human * It was still on trial in Prance in 1749, when Clairaut and Lalande magnifi cently verified it by calculating the retardation of Halley's comet. It may be said that the French are notoriously slow in adopting ideas which have originated in other countries, and that they now ignore natural selection much as they formerly ignored gravitation. Nevertheless, in spite of the Academy and Monsieur Flourens, there are plain indications that the doctrine of special creations is doomed speedily to suffer the fate in Prance which it has already suffered in Germany, England, and America.</page><page sequence="7">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 257 history began on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean, ex tend the ages during which, as paleontology shows us, both the eastern and the western hemispheres were peopled by races of men. Ten thousand centuries before the time of Homer and the Vedic poets, wild men, with brute-like crania, carried on the struggle for existence with mammoths, tigers, and gigantic bears, long since extinct. And recent researches make it prob able that even this enormous period must be multiplied six or eight fold before we can arrive at the time when men first ap peared upon the earth as creatures zoologically distinct from apes. The significance of these conclusions, even when we take into account only the shorter epoch of a single million of years, cannot be too strongly insisted upon. They show us that it is only in recent times that man has become widely dis tinguished from other animals by his capability of progress. If, as evidence of our present progressiveness, we cite the supe riority of our Whitworth guns and Chassepot rifles over the howitzers and flintlocks used by our grandfathers, we must also remember that more than twenty thousand generations liv?d and died before the primitive stone hatchets and stone-pointed arrows were superseded by battle-axes and javelins headed with bronze. During these long ages each generation must have imitated its predecessor almost as closely as is the case with brute animals. The godlike intellect, of whose achievements we are now so justly proud, was then being acquired by almost infinitely minute increments. In the face of the proved fact of man's immense antiquity, no other conclusion is admissible. I have introduced these considerations, not so much to con firm the theory of the descent of man from an ape-like animal, ? which I regard as already sufficiently proved by the evidence presented in previous chapters, ? as to illustrate the true point of view from which the evolution of humanity should be regard ed. In treating of the doctrine of evolution in general, Mr. Spencer has shown it to be a corollary from the persistence of force that the process of evolution, which at first goes on with comparative slowness, must, owing to the multiplication of effects, go on with increasing rapidity. And he shows, more over, that those most conspicuous aspects of evolution which consist in increase of definite complexity in structure and func</page><page sequence="8">258 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. tion must be much more conspicuous in the more compound than in the more simple kinds of evolution. In illustration of these closely allied truths, we may note that in all cases a long period of time elapses before any lower order of evolution gives rise to a distinctly higher order. Long ages must have passed before the slow integration of our solar nebula into a planetary system resulted in the appearance of distinctly geologic phenom ena upon the several planets. Again, it was a long time be fore geologic evolution had proceeded sufficiently far to admit of the evolution of life : upon Saturn and Jupiter, as we have seen, the genesis of anything like what we know as life would appear still to be impossible. Again, after the first appearance of life upon our earth, a long time must have elapsed before protists, simple plants, and nerveless animals were succeed ed by animals sufficiently complex to manifest even the most rudimentary phases of psychical life. And again, as we can now see, the evolution of physical and psychical life to the very high degree exemplified in the primeval ape-like man was fol lowed by a somewhat long period during which the still higher psychical changes constituting social evolution were slowly as suming their distinctive characteristics. Social evolution, therefore, regarded as a complicated series of intellectual and emotional changes determined by the aggre gation of men into communities, is a new order of evolution, more highly compounded than any that have gone before it. When, in the course of the struggle for existence, men began to unite in family groups of comparatively permanent organi zation, a new era was begun in the progress of things upon the earth's surface. A new set of structural and functional changes began, which, for a long while proceeding with the slowness characteristic of the early stages of every order of evolution, are at last proceeding with a rapidity only to be slackened when the ultimate stage of equilibrium is approached. Hence it is in the highest degree unphilosophical to attempt to explain the present position of civilized man solely by reference to the laws of organic and psychical evolution as obtained by the study of life in general. It is for'biology to explain the differences between the human hand and foot and the hands and feet of the other primates; but the chief differences</page><page sequence="9">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 259 between civilized man and the other members of the order to which he belongs are psychological differences, and the im mense series of psychical changes to which they are due has * been all along determined by social conditions. The all-important contrast, therefore, is not between man and other primates, extinct and contemporary, but between civilized man and primitive man. Already we have found that the low est contemporary man, whose social organization has never reached any higher form than that of the simplest tribal com munity, exhibits but scanty traces of the godlike intellect, the refined tastes, or the lofty soul which we are accustomed to ascribe to humanity in general as its distinctive attributes. Humanity, zoologically considered, exists to-day, to which these attributes cannot be ascribed without a considerable strain upon the accepted meaning of our words. Zoologically, the Australian belongs to the genus Homo, and is therefore nearer to us than to the gorilla or gibbon ; psychologically, he is in many respects further removed from us than from these manlike apes. No one will deny that the intellectual progress implied in counting up to five or six, though equally important, is immeasurably inferior in quantity to the subsequent progress implied in the solution of dynamical problems by means of the integral calculus, ? an achievement for which the average mod ern engineer is competent. But in going back to the primeval man, we must descend to a lower grade of intelligence than that which is occupied by the Australian. We must traverse the immensely long period during which the average human skull was enlarging from a capacity of thirty-five inches, like that of the highest apes, to a capacity of seventy inches, like those post-glacial European skulls, of which the one found at Neanderthal is a specimen, and which are about on a par with the skulls of Australians. And when we have reached the beginning of this period ? possibly in the Miocene epoch ? we may fairly represent to ourselves the individuals of the human genus as animals differing in little save a more marked sociality from the dryopithecus and other extinct half-human apes. We may represent primitive man as an animal in whom, physical and psychical changes having hitherto proceeded pari passu, intelligence had at length arrived at a point where variations</page><page sequence="10">260 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. in it would sooner be seized on by natural selection than varia tions in physical structure. When, among primates possessed of such an intelligence, the family groups temporarily formed among all mammals began to become permanent, then we must say that there began the career of humanity as distinguished from animality. For countless ages our ancestors probably were still but slightly distinguished from other primates, save that their increasing intelligence, their use of weapons, and their habits of combination rendered them more than a match for much larger and stronger animals. In the later Pliocene times these primitive men may have come to bear some resem blance to the lowest contemporary savages. Human remains and relics of the still later glacial period supply clear proof of such a resemblance ; yet the absence of any improvement in weapons and implements for many ages longer shows that as yet there was but little capability of progress. Of the career of mankind during the eight hundred thousand years which would seem to have elapsed since the era of the cave bear and woolly rhinoceros,* we possess many vestiges. But everything indicates the most extreme barbarism; nowhere does there appear a trace of anything like even the rudest civilization, until we reach that comparatively recent epoch antecedent to the dawn of history, but accessible to philology. The partial restoration of the Aryan mother-tongue enables us to go back perhaps a dozen or fifteen centuries beyond the age of Homer and the Vedas, and catch a few glimpses of the prehistoric Aryans, ? an agricultural race completely tribal in organiza * In assigning this conjectural date, I follow the theory which connects the great glacial epoch with that notable increase in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit which, as calculated by Mr. Croll, began about 950,000 years B. C, and lasted 200,000 years. But while the fact of this great increase of eccentricity is, I presume, well established, and while it can hardly fail to have wrought marked climatic changes, it is by no means proved that the glaciation of Europe and North America was produced solely or chiefly by this circumstance ; and accordingly I do not care to insist upon the chronology which I have adopted in the text. Nor is it necessary for the validity of my argument that it should be insisted on. What we do know is, that men existed both in Europe and in North America at the beginning of the glacial period ; that this extensive dispersal implies the existence of the human race for a long time previous to this epoch ; and thus we obtain a dumb antiquity in comparison with which the whole duration of the voice of historic tradition shrinks to a mere point of time. And this is all that my argument requires.</page><page sequence="11">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 261 tion, but acquainted with the use of metals, and showing marks of an intelligence decidedly above that of high contem porary barbarians like the Kaffirs. At the same time the deciphering of hieroglyphics on Egyptian monuments reveals to us the existence in the valley of the Nile of an old and im mobile civilization, organized on a tribal basis, like that of China, already sinking in political decrepitude at the ill-defined era at which we first catch sight of it. Of the beginnings of civilization on the Nile, and also, indeed, on the Euphrates, and of the stages by which the Aryans arrived at the intellect ual pre-eminence to which their recovered language bears wit ness, we know absolutely nothing. But even if we were to allow twenty thousand years for these proceedings, ? an inter val nearly seven times as long as that which separates the Homeric age from our own time, ? we should obtain but a brief period compared with the countless ages of unmitigated barbarism which preceded it. The progress of mankind is like a geometrical progression. For a good while the repeated doubling produces quite unobtrusive results ; but as we begin to reach the large numbers the increase suddenly becomes astonishing. Since the beginning of recorded history we have been moving among the large numbers, and each decade now witnesses a greater amount of psychical achievement than could have been witnessed in thousands of years among pre glacial men. Such ? result is just what the Doctrine of Evo lution teaches us to anticipate ; and it thoroughly confirms our statement that, in point of intelligence and capacity for pro gress, the real contrast is not between all mankind and other primates, but between civilized and primeval man. Let us now consider some of the leading characteristics of this gradual but increasingly rapid intellectual progress, re garded as a growing correspondence between the human mind and its environment. In his essay on " The Genesis of Science," Mr. Spencer has shown that the highest kinds of scientific knowledge differ only in degree from the lowest kinds of what is called ordinary knowledge. In spite of their great differences in mental capa city, it is obvious that the antelope who on hearing a roar from the neighboring thicket infers that it is high time to run for his</page><page sequence="12">262 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. life, the Bushman who on seeing the torn carcass of the ante lope infers that a lion has recently been present, and the astronomer who on witnessing certain unforeseen irregularities in the motions of Uranus infers that an unknown planet is attracting it, perform one and all the same kind of mental operation. In the three cases the processes are fundamentally the same, though differing in complexity according to the number and remoteness of the past and present relations which are compared. In each case the process is at bottom a group ing of objects and of relations according to their likenesses and unlikenesses. It similarly appears that all knowledge is a classification of experiences, and that every act of knowledge is an act of classification ; that an act of inference, such as is involved in simple cases of perception, is " the attributing to a body, in consequence of some of its properties, all those prop erties by virtue of which it is referred to a particular class" ; that the " forming of a generalization is the putting together in one class all those cases which present like relations " ; and that " the drawing a deduction is essentially the perception that a particular case belongs to a certain class of cases previously generalized. So that, as ordinary classification is a grouping together of like things, reasoning is a grouping together of like relations among things." * In this fundamental doctrine the two different schools of modern psychology, represented respectively by Mr. Bain and Mr. Mansel, will thoroughly agree. But from this it inevitably.follows that the highest and the lowest manifestations of intelligence consist respectively of processes which differ only in heterogeneity and definiteness and in the extent to which they are compounded. But while proving that science is but an extension of or dinary knowledge, Mr. Spencer shows also that the higher orders of knowledge differ from the lower in the greater re moteness, generality, and abstractness of the relations which they formulate, in the greater definiteness of their formulas, and in their more complete organization. His inquiry into the mutual relations of life and intelligence f has elicited an exactly parallel set of conclusions. It is there shown that psychical life * Spencer's Essays, I. 189. t Spencer, Principles of Psychology, Part III.</page><page sequence="13">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 263 consists in the continuous establishment of subjective relations answering to objective relations ; and that, as we advance through the animal kingdom from the lowest to the highest forms, this correspondence between the mind and its environ ment extends to relations which are continually more remote in space and time, more clearly defined, but at the same time more general; and finally there is also traced a progressive organization of correspondences. Continually, while passing in review the various aspects of the progress of intelligence in the animal kingdom, the author finds himself ending with illus trations drawn from that progress of human intelligence which is determined by social conditions. Let us now illustrate this subject somewhat further by tracing out the intellectual corre spondence between man and his environment, as increasing in remoteness, in speciality and generality, in complexity, in definiteness, and in coherent organization. The extension of the correspondence in space is a marked characteristic of intellectual progress, which we have already traced through the ascending groups of the animal kingdom, but which is carried much further by man than by any lower animal. It is no doubt true that the direct adjustments of pyschical relations to distant objective relations, effected by unaided perception, have a narrower range in civilized men than in uncivilized men or in several of the higher mammals and birds. It is a familiar fact that the senses of civilized man ? or at least the three senses which have a considerable range in space ? are less acute and less extensive in range than those of the barbarian. It is said that the Bushman can see as far with the naked eye as a European can see with a field glass ; and certain wild and domestic birds and mammals, as the falcon, the vulture, and perhaps the greyhound, have still longer vision. Among the different classes of civilized men, those who, by living on the fruits of brain-work done in-doors, are most widely differentiated from primeval men, have as a general rule the shortest vision. And the rapid increase of in-door life, which is one of the marked symptoms of modern civilization, tends not only to make myopia more frequent, but also to diminish the average range of vision in persons who are not myopic. There may very likely have been a similar, though</page><page sequence="14">261: The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. less conspicuous and less carefully observed, decrease in the range of hearing. And the sense of smell, which is so marvel lously efficient in the majority of mammals and in many savages, is to us of little use as an aid in effecting correspond ences in space. In the case also of those simpler indirect adjustments which would seem to involve the use of the cerebellum chiefly, we have partially lost certain powers possessed by savages and lower animals. There are few things in which civilized men differ among themselves more conspicuously than the recollec tion of places, the identification of landmarks, and the ability to reach a distant point through crooked streets without losing the way. But in these respects the most sagacious of us are but bunglers compared with primitive men or with dogs and foxes. Few things are more striking than the unerring in stinct with which the Indian makes his way through utterly trackless forests, seldom stopping to make up his mind, and taking in at a single glance whole groups of signs which to his civilized companion are inappreciable. The loss of this power of co-ordination, like the decrease in the range of the senses, is undoubtedly due to disuse, the circumstances of civilized life af fording little or no occasion for the exercise of these faculties.* But although in these respects the correspondence in space does not seem to have been extended with the progress of civil ization, yet in those far more indirect and complicated adjust ments which, as involving time-relations of force and cause, depend largely on the aid of the cerebrum, the civilized man surpasses the savage to a much greater extent than the savage surpasses the wolf or lion. "By combining his own percep tions with the perceptions of others as registered in maps," the modern "can reach special places lying thousands of miles away over the earth's surface. A ship, guided by compass and * In the course of the recent interesting discussion and correspondence in Nature concerning the " sense of direction " exhibited in barbarians and lower animals, it was observed that a party of Samoyeds will travel in a direct line from one point to another over trackless fields of ice, even on cloudy nights when there is accord ingly nothing whatever that is visible to guide their course. It would be too much to assert that this faculty is utterly lost in civilized man, so that a temporary recur rence to the conditions of barbaric life might not revive it; but even if retained at all, it is certainly kept quite in abeyance.</page><page sequence="15">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 265 stars and chronometer, brings him from, the antipodes informa tion by which his purchases here are adapted to prices there. From the characters of exposed strata he infers the presence of coal below; and thereupon adjusts the sequences of his actions to coexistences a thousand feet beneath. Nor is the environment through which his correspondences reach limited to the surface and the substance of the earth. It stretches into the surrounding sphere of infinity." In all these respects, the extension of the correspondence achieved during the pro gress of civilization has been much greater than that achieved during the immediately preceding stages of the evolution of man from an inferior primate. " From early races acquainted only with neighboring localities, up to modern geographers who specify the latitude and longitude of every place on the globe ; from the ancient builders and metallurgists, knowing but surface deposits, up to the geologists of our day whose data in some cases enable them to describe the material existing at a depth never yet reached by the miner ; from the savage barely able to say in how many days a full moon will return, up to the astronomer who ascertains the period of revolution of a double star ; ?there has been " an enormous " widening of the surrounding region throughout which the adjustment of inner to outer relations extends." * It only remains to add that the later and more conspicuous stages of this progress have been determined by that increase in the size and heterogeneity of the social environment which results from the growing inter dependence of communities once isolated, and which I have elsewhere shown to be the chief determining cause of progress in general.f For this integration of communities has not only directly enlarged the area throughout which adjustments are required to be made, but it has indirectly aided the advances in scientific knowledge requisite for making the adjustments. Great, however, as has been the extension of the correspond ence in space which has characterized the progress of the favored portion of humanity from barbarism to civilization, the extension of the correspondence in time is a much more con spicuous and more distinctively human phenomenon. As we * Spencer, Psychology, I. 317, 319. t See " The Laws of History," North American Keview, July, 1869.</page><page sequence="16">266 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. trace this kind of mental evolution through sundry classes and orders of the animal kingdom in an ascending series, it is to be observed that until we reach the higher mammals the two kinds of correspondence advance together, ? the distance at which outer relations are cognized forming a measure of .the in terval by which their effects may be anticipated. But among the higher mammals there is observed a higher order of ad justments to future emergencies, which advances more rapidly than the extension of the correspondence in space, and which in the human race first acquires a notable development. " Not that the transition is sudden," observes Mr. Spencer. " During the first stages of human progress, the method of estimating epochs does not differ in nature from that employed by the more intelligent animals. There are historical traces of the fact that originally the civilized races adjusted their actions to the longer sequences in the environment, just as Australians and Bushmen do now, by observing their coincidence with the migrations of birds, the floodings of rivers, the flowerings of plants. And it is obvious that the savages who, after the ripening of a certain berry, travel to the sea-shore, knowing that they will then find a particular shell-fish in season, are guided by much the same process as the dog who, on seeing the cloth laid for dinner, goes to the window to watch for his master. But when these phenomena of the seasons are ob served to coincide with recurring phenomena in the heavens, ? when, as was the case with the aboriginal Hottentots, periods come to be measured partly by astronomical and partly by ter restrial changes, ? then we see making its appearance a means whereby the correspondence in time may be indefinitely ex tended. The sun's daily movements and the monthly phases of the moon having once been generalized, and some small power of counting having been reached, it becomes possible to recog nize the interval between antecedents and consequents that are long apart, and to adjust the actions to them. Multitudes of sequences in the environment which, in the absence of answer ing functional periods, cannot be directly responded to by the organism, may be discerned and indirectly responded to when there arises this ability of numbering days and lunations." * * Spencer, Psychology, Vol. I. p. 326.</page><page sequence="17">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 267 In the advance to high stages of civilization, the extension of the correspondence in time is most conspicuously exempli fied in the habitual adjustment of our theories and actions to sequences more or less remote in the future. In no other respect is civilized man more strikingly distinguished from the barbarian than in his power to adapt his conduct to future events, whether contingent or certain to occur. The ability to forego present enjoyment in order to avoid the risk of future disaster is what we call prudence or providence ; and the bar barian is above all things imprudent and improvident. Doubt less the superior prudence of the civilized man is due in great part to his superior power of self-restraint ; so that this class of phenomena may be regarded as illustrating one of the phases of moral progress. Nevertheless, there are several purely intellectual elements which enter as important factors into the case. The power of economizing in harvest-time or in youth, in order to retain something upon which to live com fortably in winter or in old age, is obviously dependent upon the vividness with which distant sets of circumstances can be pictured in the imagination. The direction of the volitions involved in the power of self-restraint must be to a great extent determined by the comparative vividness with which the dis tant circumstances and the present circumstances are mentally realized. And the power of distinctly imagining objective relations not present to sense is probably the most fundamen tal of the many intellectual differences between the civilized man and the barbarian, since it underlies both the class of phenomena which we are now considering and the class of phenomena comprised in artistic, scientific, and philosophic progress. The savage, with his small and undeveloped cere brum, plays all summer, like the grasshopper in the fable, eat ing and wasting whatever he can get ; for although he knows that the dreaded winter is coming, during which he must starve and shiver, he is nevertheless unable to realize these distant feelings with sufficient force to determine his volition in the presence of his actual feeling of repugnance to toil. But the civilized man, with his large and complex cerebrum, has so keen a sense of remote contingencies that he willingly submits to long years of drudgery, in order to avoid poverty in old age, vol. cxvii. ? no. 241. 18</page><page sequence="18">268 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. pays out each year a portion of his hard-earned money to pro vide for losses by fire which may never occur, builds houses and accumulates fortunes for posterity to enjoy, and now and then enacts laws to forestall possible disturbances or usurpa tions a century hence. Again, the progress of scientific knowl edge, familiarizing civilized man with the idea of an inexora ble regularity of sequence among events, greatly assists him in the adjustment of his actions to far-distant emergencies. He who ascribes certain kinds of suffering to antecedent neglect of natural laws is more likely to shape his conduct so as to avoid a recurrence of the infliction, than he who attributes the same kinds of suffering to the wrath of an offended Deity, and fondly hopes, by ceremonial propitiation of the Deity, to escape in future. This power of shaping actions so as to meet future contin gencies has been justly recognized by political economists as an indispensable prerequisite to the accumulation of wealth in any community, without which no considerable degree of progress can be attained. The impossibility of getting bar barians to work, save under the stimulus of actually present necessities, has been one of the chief obstacles in the way of missionaries who have attempted to civilize tribal communities. The Jesuits, in the seventeenth century, were the most suc cessful of Christian missionaries, and their proceedings with the Indians of Paraguay constitute one of the most brilliant feats in missionary annals. Such unparalleled ascendency did the priests acquire over the imaginations of these barbarians, that they actually made them cease from warfare. They taught them European methods of agriculture, as well as the arts of house-building, painting, dyeing, furniture-making, even the use of watches ; and they administered the affairs of the com munity with a despotic power which has seldom been equalled either in absoluteness or in beneficence. Nevertheless, the superficiality of all this show of civilization was illustrated by the fact that, unless perpetually watched, the workmen would go home leaving their oxen yoked to the plough, or would even cut them up for supper, if no other meat happened to be at hand. Examples of a state of things intermediate between this barbaric improvidence and the care-taking foresight of the</page><page sequence="19">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 269 European are to be found among the Chinese, ? a people who have risen far above barbarism, but whose civilization is still of a primitive type. The illustration is rendered peculiarly forci ble by the fact that the Chinese are a very industrious people, and where the returns for labor are immediate will work as steadily as Germans or Americans. Owing to their crowded population, every rood of ground is needed for cultivation, and upon their great rivers the traveller continually meets with little floating farms constructed upon rafts and held in place by anchors. Yet side by side with these elaborate but fragile structures are to be seen acres of swamp-land which only need a few years of careful draining to become permanently fit for tillage. So incapable are the Chinese of adapting their actions to sequences at all remote, that they continue, age after age, to resort to such temporary devices, rather than to bestow their labor where its fruits, however enduring, cannot be enjoyed from the outset.* The contrast proves that the cause is the intellectual inability to realize vividly a group of future condi tions, involving benefits not immediately to be felt. Of the correspondence in time, even more forcibly than of the correspondence in space, it may be said that its extension during the process of social evolution has been much greater than during the organic evolution of the human race from some ancestral primate. Between the Australian, on the one hand, who cannot estimate the length of a month, or provide even for certain disaster which does not stare him in the face, and whose theory of things is adapted only to events which occur during his own lifetime ; and, on the other hand, the European, with his practical foresight, his elaborate scientific previsions, and his systems of philosophy, which embrace alike the earliest traceable cosmical changes and the latest results of civilization ; the intellectual gulf is certainly far wider than that which di vides the Australian from the fox, who hides the bird which he has killed, in order to return when hungry to eat it. It remains to add that the later and more conspicuous stages of this kind of intellectual progress have obviously been deter mined by the increase in the size and heterogeneity of the so * See Mill, Political Economy, Book I. chap. xi.</page><page sequence="20">270 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. cial environment. For the integration of communities to which this increase is due has not only indirectly aided the advances in scientific knowledge requisite for making mental adjustments to long sequences, past and future, but it has also directly as sisted the disposition to work patiently in anticipation of future returns, by increasing the general security and diminishing the chances that the returns to labor may be lost. The extension of the correspondence between subjective and objective relations in time and in space answers to that kind of primary integration which underlies the process of evolution in general. In treating of the enlarged area, in time and space, throughout which inner relations are adjusted to outer relations, we have been treating of intellectual progress regarded as a growth. But in proceeding to speak of the increasing hetero geneity, definiteness, and coherence of the adjustments,, we proceed to treat of intellectual progress regarded as a develop ment. Here, as elsewhere, throughout all save the simplest orders of evolution, quantitative increase is accompanied by qualitative increase. The knowledge is not only greater and the intellectual capacity greater, but the knowledge is more complex, accurate, and unified, and the intellectual capacity is more varied. The increase of the correspondence in definiteness may be sufficiently illustrated by the following brief citation from Mr. Spencer : " Manifestly the reduction of objective phenomena to definite measures gives to those subjective actions that corre spond with them a degree of precision, a special fitness, greatly beyond that possessed by ordinary actions. There is an im mense contrast in this respect between the doings of the astronomer who, on a certain day, hour, and minute, adjusts his instrument to watch an eclipse, and those of the farmer who so arranges his work that he may have hands enough for reaping some time in August or September. The chemist who calcu lates how many pounds of quicklime will be required to de compose and precipitate all the bicarbonate of lime which the water in a given reservoir contains in a certain percentage, ex hibits an adjustment of inner to outer relations incomparably more specific than does the laundress who softens a tubful of hard water by a handful of soda. In their adaptations to ex</page><page sequence="21">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 271 ternal coexistences and sequences, there is a wide difference between the proceedings of ancient besiegers, whose battering rams were indeterminate in their actions, and those of modern artillery officers, who, by means of a specific quantity of pow der, consisting of specific ingredients, in specific proportions, placed in a tube at a specific inclination, send a bomb of specific weight on to a specific object, and cause it to explode at a spe cific moment." * It only remains to note that the difference in specific accuracy, here illustrated by contrasting the opera tions of science with those of ordinary knowledge, is equally conspicuous when, on a somewhat wider scale, we contrast the proceedings, both scientific and artistic, of civilized men with the proceedings of the lowest savages. The most ignorant man in New England probably knows in June that winter is just six months distant; the Australian, to whom, as to the civilized child, time appears to go slowly, knows only that it is a long way off. So, too, the crude knives and hammers and the uncouth pottery of primeval men are distinguished alike by their indefiniteness of contour and by their uselessness in operations which require specific accuracy. And here, as be fore, in the extreme vagueness and lack of speciality, both in his knowledge and in the actions which are guided by it, the primeval man appears to stand nearer to the highest brutes than to the civilized moderns. Along with this increase in specialization, entailing greater definiteness of adjustment, there goes on an increase in gener alization, involving an increased power of abstraction, of which barely the germs are to be found either in the lowest men or in other highly organized mammals. The inability of savage races to make generalizations involving any abstraction is suffi ciently proved by the absence or extreme paucity of abstract expressions in their languages. As Mr. Farrar observes, " The Society-Islanders have words for dog's tail, bird's tail, and sheep's tail, yet no word f?r tail ; the Mohicans have verbs for every kind of cutting, and' yet no verb &lt; to cut.' The Aus tralians have no generic term for fish, bird, or tree. The Ma lays have no term for tree or herb, yet they have words for * Spencer, Psychology, I. 340.</page><page sequence="22">272 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. fibre, root, tree-crown, stalk, stock, trunk, twig, and shoot. Some American tongues have separate verbs for ' I wish to eat meat,' and 41 wish to eat soup,' but no verb for ' I wish ' ; and separate words for a blow with a sharp and a blow with a blunt instrument, but no abstract word for blow."* Between the stage of intellectual progress thus illustrated and that in which an unlimited capacity for generalization produces such words as " individuation " or " equilibration," the contrast is suffi ciently obvious ; and it fully confirms our theorem, that the amount of intellectual progress achieved since man became human far exceeds that which was needed to transfer him from apehood to manhood. The increase of the correspondence in complexity, already illustrated incidentally in the treatment of these other aspects of the case, is still further exemplified in the growing compli cation of the interdependence between science and the arts. When tracing the complexity of correspondence through the lower stages of the evolution of intelligence in the animal king dom, Mr. Spencer hints that the evolution of the executive faculties displayed in the organs of prehension and locomotion is closely related to that of the directive faculties displayed in the cephalic ganglia and in the organs of sense. The parallel ism may be summed up in the statement that in most, if not all, the principal classes of the animal kingdom, the animals with the most perfect prehensile organs are the most intelli gent. Thus the cuttle-fish is the most intelligent of mollusks, and the crab similarly stands at the head of crustaceans, while the parrot outranks all other birds alike in sagacity and in power of handling things, and the ape and elephant are, with the exception of man, the most sagacious of mammals.f Of the human race, too, it may be said that, although Anaxagoras was wrong in asserting that brutes would have been men had they had hands, he might safely have asserted that without hands men could never have become human. Now this inter dependence of the directive and executive faculties is continued throughout the process of social evolution in the shape of the in terdependence of the sciences and the arts. " We may properly * Chapters on Language, p. 199. t Spencer, Psychology, I. 368-372.</page><page sequence="23">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 273 say that, in its higher forms, the correspondence between the organism and its environment is effected by means of supple mentary senses and supplementary limbs.The magni fy ing-gl ass adds but another lens to the lenses existing in the eye. The crow-bar is but one more lever attached to the series of levers forming the arm and hand. And the relationship, which is so obvious in these first steps, holds throughout." We may, indeed, go still deeper, and say that science is but an extension of our ordinary sense-perceptions by the aid of rea soning, while art is but an extension of the ordinary function of our muscular system, of expressing our psychical states by means of motion. Hence it is that " each great step towards a knowledge of laws has facilitated men's operations on things ; while each more successful operation on things has, by its results, facilitated the discovery of further laws." Hence the sciences and arts, originating together, ? as in the cases of " astronomy and agriculture, geometry and the laying out of buildings, mechanics and the weighing of commodities," ? have all along reached upon each other, in an increasing variety of ways. It is sufficient to mention the reciprocal connections between navigation and astronomy, between geology and min ing, between chemistry and all the arts ; while telescopes and microscopes illustrate the truth that " there is scarcely an ob servation now made in science, but what involves the use of instruments supplied by the arts ; while there is scarcely an art process but what involves some of the provisions of science." Just as in organic evolution we find the mutual dependence of the directive and executive faculties ever increasing, so that " complete visual and tactual perceptions are impossible with out complex muscular adjustments, while elaborate actions require the constant overseeing of the senses " ; so in social evolution we find between science and art an increasing reci procity " such that each further cognition implies elaborate operative aid, and each new operation implies sundry elaborate cognitions." I need only add that, in this as in the other aspects of intellectual progress, the increase in complexity of adjustment achieved during the process of social evolution is far greater than that achieved during the immediately preced ing stages of the process of organic evolution. Between the</page><page sequence="24">274 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. ape and the primitive man, with his rude levers and hatchets and his few simple previsions, the difference in complexity of correspondence is obviously less than between the primitive man and the modern, with his steam-hammers and thermo electric multipliers, and his long list of sciences and sub sciences, any one of which it would take much more than a lifetime to master in detail. We have thus passed in review the various aspects of intel lectual progress, regarded as a process of adjustment of inner to outer relations, and we have seen that in all the most essen tial features of this progress there is a wider difference between the civilized man and the lowest savage than between the savage and the ape. It appears that those rare and admirable qualities upon which we felicitate ourselves as marks which absolutely distinguish us from brute animals, have been slowly acquired through long ages of social evolution, and are shared only to a quite insignificant extent by the lowest contemporary races of humanity. As long as we regard things statically, as forever fixed, we may well imagine an impassable gulf between ourselves and all other forms of organic existence. But as soon as we regard things dynamically, as forever changing, we are taught that the gulf has been for the most part estab lished during an epoch at the very beginning of which we were zoologically the same that we now are. The next step in our argument will be facilitated by an inquiry into the common characteristic of the various intellect ual differences between the civilized and the primitive man which we have above enumerated. The nature of this charac teristic was hinted at when we were discussing the improvi dence of the barbarian. It was observed that the power of distinctly imagining objective relations not present to sense is the most fundamental of the many intellectual differences between the civilized man and the barbarian. Making this statement somewhat wider, we may now safely assert that the entire intellectual superiority of the civilized man over the sav age, or of the modern man over the primeval man, is summed up in his superior power of representing that which is not present to the senses. For it is not only in what we call provi dence that this superiority of representation shows itself, but</page><page sequence="25">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 275 also in all those combinations of present with past impressions which accompany the extension of the correspondence in space and time, and its increase in heterogeneity, definiteness, and coherence. It is his ability to reproduce copies of his own vanished states of consciousness, and of those of his fellows, that enables the civilized man to adjust his actions to sequences occurring at the antipodes. It is the same power of represen tation which underlies his power of forming abstract and gen eral conceptions. For the peculiarity of abstract conceptions is that " the matter of thought is no longer any one object, or any one action, but a trait common to many " ; and it is, there fore, only when a number of distinct objects or relations possess ing some common trait can be represented in consciousness that there becomes possible that comparison which results in the abstraction of the common trait as the object of thought. Obviously, then, the greater the power of abstraction and gen eralization which is observed, the greater is the power of repre sentation which is implied. The case is the same with that definiteness of the intellectual processes which we have noted as distinguishing modern from primitive thinking. For the conception which underlies definiteness of thinking is the con ception of exact likeness, ? a highly abstract conception which can only be framed after the comparison of numerous repre sented cases in which degree of likeness is the common trait that is thought about. Hence not only the improvidence of the savage, but likewise the vagueness of his conceptions, his inability to form generalizations involving abstraction, and the limited area covered by his adjustments are facts which one and all find their ultimate explanation in his relative incapacity for calling up representative states of consciousness. From this same incapacity results that inflexibility of thought in which the savage resembles the brute, and which is one of the chief proximate causes of .his unprogressiveness. " One of the greatest pains to human nature," says Mr. Bagehot, " is the pain of a new idea." This pain, which only to a few of the most highly cultivated minds in the most highly civilized communities has ceased to be a pain and become a pleasure, is to the savage not so much a pain as a numbing or paralyzing shock. To rearrange the elements of his beliefs is for the</page><page sequence="26">276 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. uncivilized man an impossible task. It is not so much that he does not dare to sever some traditional association of ideas which he was taught in childhood, as it is that he is incapable of holding together in thought the clusters of representations with the continuity of which the given association is incom patible. This important point is so ably and succinctly stated by Mr. Spencer, that I cannot do better than quote his expo sition entire. After reminding us that " mental evolution, both intellectual and emotional, may be measured by the de gree of remoteness from primitive reflex action," Mr. Spencer observes that " in reflex action, which is the action of nervous structures that effect few, simple, and often-repeated co-ordi nations, the sequent nervous state follows irresistibly the an tecedent nervous state ; and does this not only for the reason that the discharge follows a perfectly permeable channel, but also for the reason that no alternative channel exists. From this stage, in which the psychical life is automatically re strained within the narrowest limits, up through higher stages in which increasing nervous complexities give increasing vari eties of actions, and possibilities of new combinations, the pro cess continues the same ; and it continues the same as we advance from the savage to the civilized man. For where the life furnishes relatively few and little-varied experiences, where the restricted sphere in which it is passed yields no sign of the multitudinous combinations of phenomena that occur elsewhere, the thought follows irresistibly one or other of the few channels which the experiences have made for it, ? cannot be determined in some other direction for want of some other channel. But as fast as advancing civilization brings more numerous experiences to each man, as well as accumulations , of other men's experiences, past and present, the ever-multi plying connections of ideas that result imply ever-multiplying possibilities of thought. The convictions throughout a wide range of cases are rendered less fixed. Other causes than those which are usual become conceivable ; other effects can be imagined; and hence there comes an increasing modifia bility of opinion. This modifiability of opinion reaches its extreme in those most highly cultured whose multitudinous experiences include many experiences of errors discovered,</page><page sequence="27">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 277 and whose representativeness of thought is so far-reaching that they habitually call to mind the various possibilities of error, as constituting a general reason for seeking new evidence and subjecting their conclusions to revision. "If we glance over the series of contrasted modes of think ing which civilization presents, beginning with the savage who, seized by the fancy that something is a charm or an omen, thereafter continues firmly fixed in that belief, and ending with the man of science whose convictions, firm where he is conscious of long-accumulated evidence having no exception, are plastic where the evidence though abundant is not yet overwhelming, we see how an increase in freedom of thought goes along with that higher representativeness accompanying further mental evolution." * If now we inquire for a moment into the causes of this higher representativeness of civilized thinking, we shall see most beautifully exemplified the way in which intellectual pro gress, as it goes on in the human race, is determined by social evolution. Intellectual progress is indeed a cause as well as a consequence of the evolution of society ; but amid the dense entanglement of causes and effects our present purpose re quires us to single out especially the dependence of progress in representativeness upon social complexity, since herein will be found the secret of the mental pre-eminence of civilized man. Now the integration of small tribes into larger and more complex social aggregates, which is the fundamental phenomenon in civilization, tends directly to heighten repre sentativeness of thinking by widening and varying the experi ences of the members of society. The member of a savage tribe must think indefinitely, concretely, rigidly, improvidently, because his intellectual experiences are so few in number and so monotonous in character. Increase in social complexity renders possible, or indeed directly produces, fresh associations of ideas in greater and greater variety and abundance, so that the decomposition and recombination of thoughts involved in abstraction and generalization is facilitated ; and along with this, the definiteness and the plasticity of thought is increased, * Spencer, Psychology, Vol. IL p. 524.</page><page sequence="28">278 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. and the contents of the mind become representative in higher and higher degrees. Thus in every way it is brought before us that sociality has been the great agent in the achievement of man's intellectual pre-eminence, and that it has operated by widening and diversifying human experience, or, in other words, by increasing the number, remoteness, and heterogeneity of the environing relations to which each individual's actions have had to be adjusted. An inquiry into the genesis of sociality will therefore best show us how the chasm which divides man intellectually from the brute is to be crossed. But before we proceed to this somewhat lengthy and circu itous inquiry, we may profitably contemplate under a new aspect the intellectual difference which we have assigned as the fundamental one between civilized and primeval man. We have observed that the intellectual superiority of man over brute and of the civilized man over the barbarian essentially consists in a greater capacity for mentally representing objects and relations remote from sense. And we have insisted upon the point that in this capacity of representation the difference between the highest and lowest specimens of normal humanity known to us far exceeds the difference between the lowest men and the highest apes. Now in closest connection with these conclusions stands the physical fact that the chief structural difference between man and ape, as also between civilized and uncivilized man, is the difference in size and complexity of cerebrum. The cerebrum is the organ especially set apart for the compounding and recompounding of impressions that are not immediately sensory. The business of co-ordinating immediately presentative impressions is performed by the medulla and other subordinate centres. The cerebrum is especially the organ of that portion of psychical life which is entirely representative. Obviously, then, the progress to higher and higher representativeness ought to be accompanied by a well-marked growth of the cerebrum relatively to the other parts of the nervous system. Now, in the light of the present argument, htjw significant is the fact that the cranial capacity of the modern Englishman surpasses that of the aboriginal non-Aryan Hindu by a difference of sixty-eight cubic inches, while between this Hindu skull and the skull of the gorilla the</page><page sequence="29">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 279 difference in capacity is but eleven cubic inches ! That is to say, the difference in volume of brain between the highest and the lowest men is at least six times as great as the difference between the lowest men and the highest apes. And if we were to take into account the differences in structural com plexity, as indicated by the creasing and furrowing of the brain-surface, we should obtain a yet more astonishing con trast. Yet, powerfully as this anatomical fact confirms the position we have all along been upholding, its full value will not be apparent if we are so dazzled by it as to overlook the significance of the lesser difference between the gorilla and the aboriginal inhabitant of India. As the Duke of Argyll very properly observes, we do right in setting a higher value in classification upon the eleven inches which intervene between the gorilla and the Hindu than upon the sixty-eight inches which intervene between the Hindu and the Englishman. For " the* significance set by the facts of nature upon that differ ence of eleven cubic inches .... is the difference between an irrational brute confined to some one climate and to some limited area of the globe, ? which no outward conditions can modify or improve, ? and a being equally adapted to the whole habitable world, with powers, however undeveloped, of comparison, of reflection, of judgment, of reason, with a sense of right and wrong, and with all these capable of accumu lated acquisition, and therefore of indefinite advance." Though considerably exaggerated in what it denies to the brute, and still more in what it claims for the aboriginal man, this state ment contains a kernel of truth which is of value for our present purpose, and which is further illustrated by the fact that a minimum of brain-substance " is constantly and uni formly associated with all the other anatomical peculiarities of man. Below that minimum the whole accompanying struct ure undergoes far more than a corresponding change,? even the whole change between the lowest savage and the highest ape. Above that minimum, all subsequent variations in quan tity are accompanied by no changes whatever in physical structure."* Here again, though the antithesis is a little too * Duke of Argyll, Primeval Man, pp. 57-64.</page><page sequence="30">280 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. absolutely stated, we have set before us a real distinction. Up to a certain point, the brain and the rest of the body are alike alterable by natural selection and such other agencies as may be concerned in the slow modification of organisms. But when the brain has reached a certain point in size and com plexity, the rest of the body ceases to change, save in a few slight particulars, and the agencies concerned in forwarding the process of evolution seem to confine themselves to the brain, and specially to the cerebrum, ? the result being marked psychical development, unattended by any notable physical alteration. Here we have reached a fact of prime importance. We may grant to the Duke of Argyll that when those eleven additional cubic inches of brain had been acquired, some kind of a Rubicon had been crossed, and a new state of things in augurated. What was that Rubicon ? The answer has been furnished by Mr. Wallace, and must rank as one of the most brilliant contributions ever yet made to the Doctrine of Evolution. Since inferior animals respond chiefly by physical changes to changes in their environment, natural selection deals chiefly with such changes, to the visible modification of their bodily structure. In the case of sheep or bears, for instance, increased cold can only select for pres ervation the individuals most warmly coated ; or if a race of lions, which has hitherto subsisted upon small and sluggish ruminants until these have been nearly exterminated, is at last obliged to attack antelopes and buffaloes, natural selection can only preserve the swiftest and strongest or most ferocious lions. But when an animal has once appeared, endowed with suffi cient intelligence to chip a stone tool and hurl a weapon, natural selection will take advantage of variations in this intel ligence, to the neglect of purely physical variations. Commu nities whose members are best able to meet by intelligent contrivances the changes in the environment will prevail over other communities, and will be less easily destroyed by physical catastrophes. Still more strikingly must this superior availa bility of variations in intelligence be exemplified, when the intelligence has progressed so far as to sharpen spears, to use rude bows, to dig pitfalls, to cover the body with leaves or skins, and to strike fire by rubbing sticks, according to the Indian version of the myth of Prometheus.</page><page sequence="31">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 281 So soon, in short, as the intelligence of an animal has, through ages of natural selection and direct adaptation, become so con siderable that a slight variation in it is of more use to the ani mal than any variation in physical structure, then such varia tions will be more and more constantly selected, while purely physical variations, being of less vital importance to the species, will be more and more neglected. Thus, while the external appearance of such an animal, and the structure of his internal nutritive and muscular apparatus, may vary but little in many ages, his cerebral structure will vary with comparative rapidity, entailing a more or less rapid variation in intellectual and emo tional attributes. Here we would seem to have the key to the singular contrast in the relations of man to contemporary anthropoid apes. We may now understand why man differs so little, in general phys ical structure and external appearance, from the chimpanzee and gorilla, while, with regard to the special point of cerebral structure and its correlative intelligence, he differs so vastly from these, his nearest living congeners, and the most sagacious of animals save himself. Coupled with what we now know concerning the immense antiquity of the human race, Mr. Wallace's brilliant suggestion goes far to bridge over the inter val, which formerly seemed so impracticable, between brute and man. If we take the thousands of centuries during which the human race has covered both the eastern and the western hemispheres, and compare with them the entire duration of re corded human history, we shall have set before us a profitable subject of reflection. Since the period during which man has possessed sufficient intelligence to leave a traditionary record of himself is but an infinitesimal fraction of the period during which he has existed upon the earth, it is but fair to conclude that, during those long ages of which none but a geologic rec ord of his existence remains, he was slowly acquiring that superior intelligence which now so widely distinguishes him from all other animals. Throughout an enormous period of time, his brain-structure and its correlated intellectual and emotional functions must have been constantly modified both by natural selection and by direct adaptation, while his out ward physical appearance has undergone few modifications ;</page><page sequence="32">282 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. and of these the most striking would seem to be directly or indirectly consequent upon the cerebral changes.* It is a corollary from the foregoing considerations, that no race of organisms can in future be produced through the agency of natural selection and direct adaptation which shall be zo ologically distinct from, and superior to, the human race. As the same causes which physically modify lower species have, for countless ages, modified man directly and greatly in intelli gence and only indirectly and slightly in physical constitution, it follows that mankind is destined to advance during future ages in psychical attributes, but is likely to undergo only slight changes in outward appearance. It is by the co-ordination of intellectual and moral relations that man maintains himself in equilibrium with the physical, intellectual, and moral relations arising in his ever-changing environment. And hence in the future, as in the recent past, the dominant fact in the career of humanity is not physical modification, but civilization. Here we are brought to the verge of that profound theory of civilization which I have elsewhere sought to elucidate.f W? have touched upon a grand truth, of which it would be difficult to overrate the importance. For we can now admit ? not as a concession to Mr. St. George Mivart, but as a legitimate re sult of our own method of inquiry ? that when " the totality * To the general observer, as to the anatomist, the most notable points of differ ence between civilized -and uncivilized man, as well as between man and the chim panzee or gorilla, are the differences in the size of the jaws and the inclination of the forehead. The latter difference is directly consequent upon increase of intelli gence ; and the former is indirectly occasioned by the same circumstance. Por the diminution of the jaws, entailed by civilization, is, no doubt, primarily due to dis use ; and the disuse is occasioned partly by difference in food, and partly by the employment of tools, and the consequent increased reliance upon the hands as pre hensile organs. All these circumstances are the result of increased intelligence. And in addition to this, it is probable that increased frontal development has directly tended, by correlation of growth, to diminish the size of the jaws, as well as to push forward the bridge of the nose. To the increased reliance upon the hands as prehensile organs ? a circumstance which we have seen to be in an espe cial degree characteristic of developing intelligence ? is probably also due the com plete attainment of the erect position of the body, already partially obtained by the anthropoid apes. Cerebral development thus accounts for all the conspicuous physical peculiarities of man except his bare skin, ? a phenomenon for which no satisfactory explanation has yet been suggested. t See " The Laws of History," North American Review, July, 18C9.</page><page sequence="33">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 283 of man's being " is taken into the account, the difference be tween ape and mushroom is less important than the difference between ape and man. And without conceding aught to that superlative nonsense known as the " doctrine of special crea tions," we may admit, with the Duke of Argyll, that the eleven cubic inches of brain-space, by which the aboriginal Hindu sur passes the gorilla, have a higher value, for purposes of classifi cation, than the sixty-eight cubic inches by which the modern Englishman surpasses the Hindu. We now see what kind of a Rubicon it was which was crossed when those eleven cubic inches of brain (or even when four or five of them) had been gained. The crossing of the Rubicon was the point at which natural selection began to confine itself chiefly to variations in psychical manifestation. The ape-like progenitor of man, in whom physical and psychical changes had gone on pari passu for countless aeons, until he had reached the grade of intelligence implied by the possession of a brain four or five cubic inches more capacious than that of the gorilla, had now, as we may suppose, obtained a brain upon which could be devolved, to a greater and greater extent, the task of maintaining relations with the environment. Then began a new chapter in the his tory of the evolution of life. Henceforward the survival of the fittest, in the line of man's ancestry, was the survival of the cerebrums best able to form representative combinations. The agencies which had hitherto been at work in producing an or ganic form endowed with rare physical capacities, now began steadfastly to labor in producing a mind capable to a greater and greater extent of ideally resuscitating and combining rela tions not present to the senses. But immense as was the step thus achieved in advance, the progress from brute to man was not yet accomplished. As we have already shown, the circumstances which by widening and diversifying experience have mainly contributed to heighten man's faculty of representativeness, have been for the most part circumstances attendant upon man's sociality, or the capacity of individuals for aggregating into communities of in creasing extent and complexity. Here we become involved in considerations relating to the emotions as well as to the intel ligence.

The task now before us, therefore, is to explain the genesis of the moral feel ings which lie at the bottom of sociality in the human race ; and with reference to this question I shall presently have a suggestion to offer, which will be found as serviceable as it is interesting and novel. Let us for the moment, however, con sider the implications of current ethical theories, and especially let us examine the scientific basis of what is too crudely desig nated as utilitarianism. II. There are two things, said Kant, which fill me with awe be cause of their sublimity, ? the starry heavens* above us, and the moral law within us. From the modern point of view there is interest as well as instruction to be found in the im plied antithesis. While in the study of the stellar universe we contemplate the process of evolution on a scale so vast that reason and imagination are alike baffled in the effort to trace out its real significance, and we are overpowered by the sense of the infinity that surrounds us ; on the other hand, in the study of the moral sense we contemplate the last and noblest product of evolution which we can ever know, ? the attribute latest to be unfolded in the development of psychical life, and by the pos session of which we have indeed become as gods, knowing the good and the evil. The theorems of astronomy and the theo rems of ethics present to us the process of evolution in its ex tremes of extension and of intension respectively. For although upon other worlds far out in space there may be modes of ex istence immeasurably transcending humanity, yet these must remain unknowable by us. And while this possibility should be allowed its due weight in restraining us from the vain en deavor to formulate the infinite and eternal Sustainer of the universe in terms of our own human nature, as if the highest</page><page sequence="35">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 285 symbols intelligible to us were in reality the highest symbols, nevertheless it can in no way influence or modify our science. To us the development of the noblest of human attributes must ever remain the last term in the stupendous series of cosmic changes, of which the development of planetary systems is the first term. And our special synthesis of the phenomena of cosmic evolution, which began by seeking to explain the genesis of the earth and its companion worlds,* will be fitly concluded when we have offered a theory of the genesis of those psy chical activities whose end is to secure to mankind the most perfect fulness of life upon this earth which is its dwelling place. The great philosopher whose remark has suggested these reflections would not, however, have been ready to assent to the interpretation here given. Though Kant was one of the chief pioneers of the doctrine of evolution, having been the first to propose and to elaborate in detail the theory of the nebular origin of planetary systems, yet the conception of a continuous development of life in all its modes, physical and psychical, was not sufficiently advanced, in Kant's day, to be adopted into philosophy. Hence in his treatment of the mind, as regards both intelligence and emotion, Kant took what I have elsewhere called a statical view of the subject ; and finding in the adult civilized mind, upon the study of which his systems of psychology and ethics were founded, a number of organized moral intuitions and an organized moral sense, which urges men to seek the right and shun the wrong, irre spective of utilitarian considerations of pleasure and pain, he proceeded to deal with these moral intuitions and this moral sense as if they were ultimate facts, incapable of being analyzed into simpler emotional elements. Now as the following expo sition may look like a defence of utilitarianism, it being really my intention to show that utilitarianism in the deepest and widest sense is the ethical philosophy imperatively required by the facts, it is well to state, at the outset, that the existence of a moral sense and moral intuitions in civilized man is fully granted. It is admitted that civilized man possesses a complex group of emotions, leading him to seek the right and avoid the * The reference is to the unpublished chapter on Planetary Evolution.</page><page sequence="36">286 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. wrong, without any reference to considerations of utility ; and I disagree entirely with those utilitarian disciples of Lockte, who would apparently refer these ethical emotions to the organization of experiences of pleasure and pain in the case of each individual. So long as the subject is contemplated from a statical point of view, so long as individual experience is studied without reference to ancestral experience, the follower of Kant can always hold his ground against the follower of Locke, in ethics as well as in psychology. When the Kantian asserts that the intuitions of right and wrong, as well as the intuitions of time and space, are independent of experience, he occupies a position which is impregnable, so long as the organ ization of experiences through successive generations is left out of the discussion. But as soon as we begin to study the subject dynamically, everything is shown up in a new light. Admitting the truth of the Kantian position, that there exists in us a moral sense, for analyzing which our individual experi ence does not afford the requisite data, and which must therefore be regarded as ultimate for each individual, it is nevertheless open to us to inquire into the emotional antecedents of this organized moral sense as exhibited in ancestral types of psychical life. The inquiry will result in the conviction that the moral sense is not ultimate, but derivative, and that it has been built up out of slowly organized experiences of pleasures and pains. But before we can proceed directly upon the course thus marked out, it is necessary that we should determine what are meant by pleasures and pains. What are the common charac teristics, on the one hand, of the states of consciousness which we call pleasures, and, on the other hand, of the states of con sciousness which we call pains ? According to Sir William Hamilton, " pleasure is a reflex of the spontaneous and unim peded exertion of a power of whose energy we are conscious ; pain is a reflex of the overstrained or repressed exertion of such a power." That this theory, which is nearly identical with that of Aristotle, is inadequate to account for all the phenomena of pleasure and pain, has been, I think, conclusively proved by Mr. Mill. With its complete adequacy, however, we need not now concern ourselves ; as we shall presently see that</page><page sequence="37">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 287 a different though somewhat allied statement will much better express the facts in the case. Hamilton's statement, however inadequate, is illustrated by a number of truths which for our present purpose are of importance. A large proportion of our painful states of consciousness are attendant upon the inaction, or what Hamilton less accurately calls the " repressed exer tion," of certain organic functions. According to the character of the functions in question, these painful states are known as cravings or yearnings. Inaction of the alimentary canal and that molecular inaction due to deficiency of water in the system are attended by feelings of hunger and thirst, which vary from slight discomfort to intense agony according as the inaction is prolonged. Of kindred character are the acquired cravings for tobacco, alcohol, and other narcotics. Inaction of the muscles causes great discomfort in children who are com pelled to sit still, and grown persons feel similar annoyance when the enforced stillness is long enough kept up. Prisoners kept in dark cells soon feel an intense craving for light, which in time becomes scarcely less intolerable than raging hunger. A similar explanation suffices for the emotional yearnings involved in home-sickness, ennui, deprivation of the approval of our fellow-creatures, or in separation from our favorite pur suits. All these painful states are due to the enforced inaction of certain feelings, social or aesthetic. And in similar wise, as Mr. Spencer observes, the bitter grief attendant upon the death of a friend results from the ideal representation of a future in which certain groups of habitual emotions must remain inactive or unsatisfied by outward expression. The objection may be made that all this is but an elaborate way of saying that certain pains result from the deprivation of certain pleasures. But since such an objection, in its very statement, recognizes that certain kinds of unimpeded activity, physical or psychical, are pleasures, it need not disturb us, or lead us to underestimate the value of Hamilton's suggestion. Let us note next that excessive action of any function, equally with deficient action, is attended by pain. Local pain results from intensified sensations of heat, light, sound, or pressure ; and though it may be in some cases true, as Mr. Spencer asserts, that sweet tastes are not rendered positively disagreeable by</page><page sequence="38">288 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. any degree of intensity,* the alleged fact seems contrary to my own experience, and to that of several other persons whom I have questioned. Other local pains, as in inflammation and sundry other forms of disease, are apparently due to increased molecular activity in the parts affected. And the feelings of pain or discomfort, both local and systemic, attendant upon over-exercise, over-eating, or excessive use of a narcotic, are to be similarly explained. Thus we may say that pleasure, generally speaking, is " the concomitant of an activity which is neither too small nor too great," and we get at the significance of the Epicurean maxim, fxnhev ayav. But this doctrine, as already hinted, is by no means complete. For, as Mr. Mill and Mr. Spencer ask, " What constitutes a medium activity ? What determines that lower limit of pleasurable action below which there is craving, and that higher limit of pleasurable action above which there is pain ? " And furthermore, " how happen there to be certain feelings (as among tastes and odors) which are disagreeable in all degrees of intensity, and others that are agreeable in all degrees of intensity ? " f The an swer, as Mr. Spencer shows, is to be sought in the study of the past conditions under which the feelings have been evolved. If the tentacles of a polyp are rudely struck by some passing or approaching body, the whole polyp contracts violently in such a manner as to throw itself slightly out of the way ; but if a fragment of assimilable food, floating by, happens to touch one of the tentacles gently, the tentacle grasps it and draws it slowly down to the polyp's* digestive sac. Now between these contrasted actions there is no such psychical difference as accom panies the similarly contrasted human actions of taking food and ducking the head to avoid a blow ; for the polyp's contractions, being simply reflex actions of the lowest sort, are unattended by states of consciousness, either agreeable or disagreeable. Nevertheless there is one respect in which the two cases per fectly agree. In both cases there is a seeking of that which is beneficial to the organism, and a shunning of that which is injurious. And while, in the case of the polyp, there is no * Spencer, Psychology, I. 276. t Ibid. 277.</page><page sequence="39">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 289 conscious pleasure or pain, we may fairly surmise that, as soon as any animal's psychical life becomes sufficiently complex to be attended by distinct states of consciousness, the presence of that which is beneficial is accompanied by a pleasurable feeling which leads to the seeking of it, while the presence of that which is injurious is accompanied by a painful feeling which leads to the shunning of it. Our surmise is strengthened as we reconsider the human actions lately enumerated, and observe that the abnormal activity of a function, either in deficiency or in excess, is injurious, while the normal activity of a function in balance with its companion functions is beneficial. As Mr. Spencer says, " in a mutually dependent set "of organs having a consensus of functions, the very existence of a special organ having its special function implies that the absence of its func tion must cause disturbance of the consensus, ? implies, too, that its function may be raised to an excess which must cause disturbance of the consensus, ? implies, therefore, that main tenance of the consensus goes along with a medium degree of its function." In accordance with this view, we may note that hunger and thirst are feelings attendant upon a kind of functional inaction which is harmful, and even fatal if prolonged; that inaction or excessive action of the muscles is injurious as well as painful; that the intense heat and cold, and the violent pressure, which cause distress, will also cause more or less injury, and may cause death; that the discomfort following repletion and narcosis is the concomitant of a state of things which, if kept up, must end in dyspepsia, or other forms of disease, entailing usually a permanent lower ing of nutrition ; and that the intense sounds and lights which distress the ear and eye also tend to produce deafness and blindness. And in like manner, the enforced inaction of the social and aesthetic feelings, which is attended by mental dis comfort, is also attended in the long run by a diminution of the fulness and completeness of psychical life, which in ex treme cases may result in consumption, insanity, or narcotic craving. It would seem, therefore, that the class of cases upon which Hamilton relied will justify an interpretation much deeper than the one which he proposed for them. They will appar</page><page sequence="40">290 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. ently justify us in asserting that pleasure is a state of conscious ness accompanying modes of activity which tend to increase the fulness of life of an organism, while pain is a state of conscious ness accompanying modes of activity which tend to diminish the fulness of life. Before considering the objections to this doctrine, ? which, though at first sight formidable, will disap pear on further analysis, ? let us note, with Mr. Spencer, that, on the theory of evolution, " races of sentient creatures could have come into existence under no other conditions." Omit ting the cases which, in human psychology, are complicated by the foresight of remote or inconspicuous consequences, Mr. Spencer observes that pleasure is " a feeling which we seek to bring into consciousness and retain there," while pain is " a feeling which we seek to get out of consciousness and to keep out." Hence it follows that " if the states of consciousness which a creature endeavors to maintain are the correlatives of injurious actions, and if the states of consciousness which it endeavors to expel are the correlatives of beneficial actions, it must quickly disappear through persistence in the injurious and avoidance of the beneficial." In other words, even sup posing a race of animals could come into existence, which should habitually seek baneful actions as pleasurable, and shun useful actions as painful, natural selection would immediately exterminate it. Our supposition is therefore a hibernicism ; under the operation of natural selection no such race could ever come into existence. Only those races can exist whose feel ings, on the average, result in actions which are in harmony with environing relations. Accordingly we may rest upon a still deeper and firmer basis our doctrine of pleasure and pain, and assert that pleasure is a state of consciousness accompany ing the relatively complete adjustment of inner to outer rela tions, while pain is a state of consciousness attendant upon the discordance between inner and outer relations. We may now consider a class of facts which at first seem inconsistent with the theory, but which in reality serve further to illustrate it. Animals now and then perform self-destruc tive actions under circumstances which make it difficult to sup pose thai the performance is not pleasurable. Though the majority of vegetable poisons are disagreeable to the taste,</page><page sequence="41">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 291 yet this is not always the case ; and hence animals have been known to perish after a greedy meal upon some noxious herb. But here, as in the case of the moth which, in Tennyson's phrase, is " shrivelled in a fruitless fire," there is a new rela tion in the environment for which there is no corresponding adjustment established in the organism. The cases are like that of the child who ignorantly drinks a sweet poison, or satisfies its desire for muscular activity by climbing out of the window. The dynamic theory of life does not imply the pre-existence of internal relations answering to all possible external relations. Were it so, life would be complete from the outset. For new emergencies there have to be new ad justments. Now manifestly if the whole race of moths could be made to live among lighted candles, one. of two things must happen : either there must be generated a tendency to avoid the candles, or the race must be exterminated. If an animal migrates to a district where poisonous herbs abound, its existence can be maintained only on one of two conditions : if it be low in intelligence, a disagreeable taste must be gener ated, so that the noxious food will be instantly rejected, or the odor must become offensive, so that the taste will be fore warned ; but if the animal be possessed of high intelligence, like a bird or mammal, it will be enough if the dangerous object is identified by smell or taste, or even by vision or touch, while along with the recognition there occurs an ideal repre sentation of danger. Hence it is not necessary to the main tenance of a race like mankind that all poisons should be bitter, or that injurious actions, newly tried, should painfully affect any of the senses. The work of making the needful adjustments is thrown largely upon the cerebrum, with its power of forming ideal sequences like those formerly experi enced, and of directing action so as to anticipate them. Here, indeed, we come suddenly upon one of the conditions of human progressiveness, as above illustrated. We can now begin to see why man finds pleasure in so many kinds of activity which are noxious to himself. In no other animal are the failures of adjustment between pleasurable and painful states, and beneficial and hurtful actions, so numerous or so conspicuous as in man. Though in the adjustments upon</page><page sequence="42">292 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. which the maintenance of life immediately depends, the cor respondence is of necessity unimpaired, yet in those less essential adjustments concerned in keeping up the greatest possible fulness of life, there is frequent and lamentable im perfection. Thus, ? to take one instance out of a hundred, ? we continually see pleasurable states of consciousness asso ciated with hurtful actions in the cases of men who ruin them selves by the abuse of narcotics. The fact that men, who are so much wiser than brutes, should often persist in conduct un worthy of brute intelligence, has long formed the theme of much sage but fruitless moralizing. By Calvinistic theologians such phenomena were formerly cited in proof of the theory that man is morally the lowest of creatures, having been ren dered thoroughly unsound by the eating of the apple in Eden. It is needless to say that science offers a very different explana tion. It follows from our inquiry into the causes of organic evolution,* that the adjustments which tend to maintain the highest fulness of life can be kept up only by natural selection or by direct equilibration. Now we have already had occasion to notice that in the human race, partly on account of the extreme complexity of its individual organization, partly on account of superadded social conditions, the action of natural selection is to a great extent checked. I do not allude to the fact that the supremely important human sympathies, which have grown up in the course of social evolution, compel us to protect the idle and intemperate, so that, instead of starving, they are " enabled to multiply at the expense of the capable and industrious." For far deeper than this lies the circum stance that " there are so many kinds of superiorities which severally enable men to survive, notwithstanding accompany ing inferiorities, that natural selection cannot by itself rectify any particular unfitness ; especially if, as usually happens, there are coexisting unfitnesses which all vary independent ly." f In a race of inferior animals a function in excess is quickly reduced by natural selection, because, owing to the universal slaughter, the highest completeness of life possible to a given grade of organization is required for the mere main tenance of life. But under the conditions surrounding human * In an unpublished chapter. t Spencer, Psychology, I. 284.</page><page sequence="43">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 293 development, a function in excess may remain in excess, pro vided its undue exercise is not such as is incompatible with life. Through countless ages, for example, the feelings which insure the maintenance of the race have been strengthened by natural selection, because of their prime importance to every race. But under the conditions of civilized life, the sexual passion has become a function in excess, which natural selec tion is powerless to reduce, because, although it is probably the source of more crime and misery than any other excessive function, and therefore detracts more from complete individua tion or the fulness of human life than any other, it is never theless but seldom incompatible with the maintenance of life. In all such cases, mankind has so many other functions, besides the excessive ones, which enable it to subsist and achieve pro gress in spite of them, that their reduction to the normal stand ard is left for the slow process of direct equilibration. The action of direct equilibration, in turn, is greatly com plicated, among the progressive races, by the rapid and exten sive change of the social environment from age to age. A new set of readjustments need to be made almost before the old ones are completed ; and the result is that there are always a number of functions somewhat out of balance. When civ ilization is rapidly progressing., each generation of men is forced intg kinds of activity to which the inherited emotional tendencies, and in some cases even the inherited physical con stitutions, are not thoroughly adapted. Hence the number and variety of pathological phenomena, both mental and phys ical, is greater in civilized than in savage communities. As might be expected, the present century, which has witnessed a far more extensive revolution in the modes of human activity than any previous age, exhibits numerous instances of these minor failures of adjustment. Xo take the most conspicuous example,?the progress of science and industry during the past three generations has raised the average standard of comfortable living so greatly and so suddenly, that to attain this standard an excessive strain is put upon men's powers. In many respects, it is harder to live to-day than it was a hun dred years ago. As a general rule we are overworked until late in life in the mere effort to secure the means of maintain</page><page sequence="44">294 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. ing life. Not only does this continual overwork entail a seri ous disturbance of the normal equilibrium between pleasures and pains and the correlative benefits and injuries, since it involves the undue exertion of certain faculties and the undue repression of others, but there is further disturbance due to the specific character of the overwork. Throughout a very large and constantly increasing portion of the community, the excessive labor is intellectual labor ; the abnormal strain comes upon the nervous system. The task of maintaining the correspondence with environing relations, which in the course of organic evolution has been intrusted more and more largely to the nervous system, and which in the course of social evolution has been thrown more and more upon the cerebrum, has during the past hundred years been thrown upon the cere brum to a formidable extent. The community, therefore, is suffering not simply from overwork, but from excessive brain work, in the shape of inordinate thinking and* planning, and inordinate anxiety. " Further, it is to be observed that many of the industrial activities which the struggle for existence has thrust on the members of modern societies, are in-door activi ties, ? activities not only unresponded to by the feelings in herited by aboriginal men, but in direct conflict with those more remotely inherited and deeply organized feelings which prompt a varied life in the open air." Hence manifold dis turbance. " A sedentary occupation pursued for years in a confined air, regardless of protesting ?ensations, brings about a degenerate physical state in which the inherited feelings are greatly out of harmony with the superinduced requirements of the body. Desired foods, originally appropriate, become indigestible. An air pleasure-giving by its freshness to those in vigor, brings colds and rheumatisms. Amounts of exertion and excitement naturally healthful and gratifying are found injurious. All which evils, due though they are to continued disregard of the guidance of inherited feelings, come eventu ally to be mistaken for proofs that the guidance of inherited feelings is worthless." * * Spencer, Psychology, I. 282, 283. Light is thus thrown upon the misuse of alcohol and tobacco, ? one of the most conspicuous of the cases in which man's physical appetites prompt to actions that are injurious. I have shown in another</page><page sequence="45">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 295 Further to pursue this interesting subject would be to con vert a set of illustrations, already too elaborately stated, into work, that in healthy persons the prudent use of these narcotics ? so interesting in many ways to the student of psychology ? is attended by an increase in vital power. As economizing nervous energy they enhance the general fulness of life, and the pleasure which accompanies the use of them is accordingly at the outset a normal pleasure. But in many cases the incautious use of these substances, and especially of alcohol (which acts directly upon the cerebrum), generates a nar cotic craving which is abnormal, as prompting to injurious actions. I do not cite this craving as peculiar to our present stage of civilization, for, like most other forms of mental disease, it has been known for many ages ; and recent researches make it somewhat doubtful whether excessive narcosis will develop it in the life time of a single individual, unless there is hereditary predisposition. Many per sons can use alcohol, and can frequently abuse it, through a long life, without ever acquiring the resistless craving known as methomania or dipsomania. It was for merly supposed that drunkenness tends to produce consumption and certain kinds of insanity, but it is now become probable that the case is just the reverse, the drunkenness being an early symptom of the other disease. Dr. Maudsley has col lected evidence which would seem to indicate that the same hereditary taint may result indifferently in dipsomania, insanity, epilepsy, neuralgia, or consumption, ? to which list dyspepsia should be added. Now consumption and dyspepsia are at bottom nervous diseases, the conspicuous pulmonary and gastric symptoms being only secondary. The former, indeed, often ends in death from exhaustion, while the lungs are still perfectly sound. Consumption is primarily an excessive lower ing of nutrition, an abnormal increase of the ratio of waste to repair, attendant upon defective nerve-stimulus ; and it agrees with the other diseases just enumer ated, in being rarely, if ever, fully developed in the course of a single generation. In organisms vitiated by the hereditary taint, the requisite lowering of nutrition may be brought about by the inflammation of a cold or fever, or it may equally well be caused by sorrow, anxiety, or overwork. Now all this is true likewise of insanity, neuralgia, and dipsomania. Whether the observed phenomenon is the softening of the brain, the molecular degeneration of a nerve-fibre, the deposit of tubercle, or the ill-understood cerebral change which attends the craving for drink, the underlying fact is the increased ratio of waste to repair ; and whatever cause diminishes repair to an extraordinary degree may also produce any of these kin dred forms of disease, wherever there is hereditary predisposition. A sudden and violent physical shock may do this. Cases are on record in which persons have immediately become hopeless drunkards after falling from a carriage or receiving a violent blow on the head ; and in the cases of this sort which I have in mind, there had been no previous signs of craving for drink, but there was hereditary taint derived from the father or grandfather. But anxiety and excessive brain work, operating slowly but surely, bring out dipsomania and other forms of insan ity much more frequently than they are brought out by physical shocks. We may now, I think, begin to discern the significance of the fact that, while in some other centuries, as the fourteenth, the prevailing diseases were typhoid in char acter, being chiefly generated by barbaric habits of uncleanness, on the other hand in the nineteenth century the prevailing diseases are those which result from excessive waste or inadequate repair of nerve-tissue. We may also begin to under stand the fact that, while further growth of the aesthetic feelings has greatly dimin</page><page sequence="46">296 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. an unmanageable digression. Summing up the results now obtained, we see that natural selection, acting less rigidly un der the limitations imposed by social evolution, fails to reduce functions that are in excess, and leaves them to be reduced by direct equilibration. The process is accordingly slow, since direct adaptation to a rapidly changing environment is at tended by the appearance of minor unfitnesses, which further complicate the emotional disturbance, and disarrange the nor mal relations between incentives and actions. We need not, therefore, be surprised at the fact that men often find pleasure in detrimental activities ; nor need we indorse the Puritanic or ascetic theory, suggested partly by the contemplation of this fact, " that painful actions are beneficial and pleasurable ac tions detrimental." For if this were to any considerable ex tent the case, sentient life would inevitably disappear from the face of the earth. . The cases which we have cited belong to ethical pathology. And just as pathologic phenomena do not invalidate the laws of physiology, just as the dynamic theory of life is not invalidated by the fact that maladjustments are continually met with, so neither do cases of moral disease invalidate the corollary which inevitably follows from the Doc trine of Evolution, "that pleasures are the incentives to life supporting acts and pains the deterrents from life-destroying acts." We are now prepared to deal with the phenomena of right and wrong, and to notice how they become distinguished from the phenomena of pleasure and pain. Though the foregoing discussion forms the basis for a general doctrine of morality, it is nevertheless an inadequate basis, until properly supple ished the gluttony and convivial drunkenness characteristic of preceding centuries, nevertheless, so far as can be ascertained, dyspepsia and dipsomania have not de creased during the present century. We can see that these diseases, along with phthisis, insanity, and general paralysis (which is the sudden breakdown of the nervous system after long-continued structural degradation) are emphatically diseases incident upon a rapid change in the social environment which the energies of the organism are strained to the utmost in meeting. And we can also see that among the minor failures of adjustment which accompany such a rapid change, there must occur cases of abnormal appetites which, owing to the great complica tion of their causes and the ability of society to exist in spite of them; are but slowly and partially checked by natural selection.</page><page sequence="47">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 297 mented. The existence of a moral sense has purposely been as far as possible unrecognized ; for I believe that in dealing with these complex subjects, little can be accomplished, save on the plan of separately cornering the various elements in the problem, and flooring them one by one. Any philosophy of ethics, therefore, which might be founded upon the preceding analysis, could be nothing more than a theory of Hedonism, recognizing no other incentive to proper action than the pleas ing of one's self. By one of the innumerable tricks which the misuse of current words plays with the understanding, the so-called utilitarian theory has been, and still is, not unfre quently identified with this kind of hedonistic philosophy, which is in truth its very antipodes. The error is much like that involved in the accusation of fatalism, commonly hurled at those who maintain the obvious and harmless assertion that moral actions conform to law. But the difference, comprising the entire difference between the noblest self-sacrifice and the meanest self-fondling, is as follows: In our theory of pleasure and pain, which if taken as ultimate would be hedonism, the well-being of the community has been as far as possible omit ted from the account. Wherever I have introduced references to social phenomena, I have considered them only in their effects upon the fulness of life of the individual. In dealing with the incentives to action in a race of brute animals, the foregoing considerations would be sufficient. But in the so called utilitarian theory as it is now to be expounded, the well-being of the community, even when incompatible with that of the individual, is the all-important consideration. While the actions deemed pleasurable are those which con duce to the fulness of life of the individual, the actions deemed right are those which conduce to the fulness of life of the community. And while the actions deemed painful are those which detract from the fulness of life of the individual, the actions deemed wrong are those which detract from the fulness of life of the community. According to utilitarianism, therefore, as ,here expounded, the conduct approved as moral is the disinterested service of the community, and the conduct stigmatized as immoral is the selfish preference of individual interests to those of the community. And bearing in mind</page><page sequence="48">298 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. that the community, which primevally comprised only the little tribe, has by long-continued social integration come to com prise the entire human race, we have the ultimate theorem of the utilitarian philosophy, as properly understood, that actions morally right are those which are beneficial to humanity, while actions morally wrong are those which are detrimental to humanity. Are we to maintain, then, that when we approve of certain actions, we do so because we consciously and deliberately rea son out, in each particular case, the conclusion that these actions are beneficial to mankind ? By no means. Not only is it that the highest science cannot always enable us to say surely of a given action that it is useful to mankind, but it is also that we do not stop to apply science to the matter at all. We approve of certain actions and disapprove of certain actions quite instinctively. We shrink from stealing or lying as we shrink from burning our fingers ; and we no more stop to frame the theorem that stealing and lying, if universally practised, must entail social dissolution and a reversion to primeval barbarism, than we stop to frame the theorem that frequent burning of the fingers must entail an incapacity for efficient manual operations. In short, there is in our psychical structure a moral sense which is as quickly and directly hurt by wrong-doing or the idea of wrong-doing as our tactile sense is hurt by stinging. Shall we, then, maintain, as a corollary from the Doctrine of Evolution, that our moral sense is due to the organic regis tration, through countless ages, of deliberate inferences that some actions benefit humanity, while others injure it ? Shall we say that the primeval savage began by reasoning his way to the conclusion that if treachery were to be generally allowed, within the limits of the tribe, then the tribe must succumb in the struggle for existence to other tribes in which treachery was forbidden ; and that, by a gradual organization of such inductions from experience, our moral sense has slowly arisen ? This position is no more tenable than the other. Mr. Rich ard Hutton and Mr. St. George Mivart have attributed to Mr. Spencer some such doctrine. But Mr, Spencer is too profound a thinker to ignore so completely the conditions under which</page><page sequence="49">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 299 permanent emotional states are generated. Our moral sense has arisen in no such way. But to understand the way in which it has arisen, we must recur to our fundamental prob lem, and seek for the conditions which first enabled social evolution, as distinguished from organic evolution, to start upon its career. It is now time to propose an answer to the question, already twice suggested and partly answered, How did social evolu tion originate ? Starting from the researches of Sir Henry Maine, which are supported by those of Messrs. Tylor, M'Len nan, and Lubbock, we have come to the conclusion that it originated when families, temporarily organized among all the higher mammals, became in the case of the highest mammal permanently organized. Starting from the deductions of Mr. Wallace, we have seen reason for believing that civilization originated when in the highest mammal variations in intelli gence became so much more important than variations in physical structure that they began to be seized upon by natural selection to the exclusion of the latter. In the permanent family we have the germ of society. In the response to outer relations by psychical changes which almost completely subor dinate physical changes, we have the germ of civilization. Let us now see what can be done by combining these two theorems, so that the permanent organization of families and the complex intelligence of the highest mammal will appear in their causal relations to each other. Many mammals are gregarious, and gregariousness implies incipient power of combination and of mutual projection. But gregariousness differs from sociality by the absence of definite family relationships, except during the brief and inter mittent periods in which there are helpless offspring to be protected. Now it might be maintained that the complex intelligence of the highest mammal led him vaguely to recog nize the advantage of associating in more and more permanent groups for the sake of mutual protection. From this point of view Mr. Darwin argues that men were originally a race of weak and mild creatures, like chimpanzees, and not a race of strong and ferocious creatures like gorillas, and were accord ingly forced to combine because unable to defend themselves vol. cxvii.?no. 241. 20</page><page sequence="50">300 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. singly. It is undeniable that man is, relatively to his size, a weak animal ; and there is much value in Mr. Darwin's sug gestion. Nevertheless, it can hardly be said to explain social ity as distinguished from gregariousness. It may also be argued that the superior sagacity even of the lowest savage makes him quite a formidable antagonist to animals much more powerful than himself. Besides, the study of savage life brings out results at variance with the notion of man's primitive gentleness. A strong case might be made in support of the statement that uncivilized man is an extremely ferocious ani mal, and that among savage races, which certainly differ very notably in natural ferocity of disposition, the most ferocious tribes are often the most likely to become dominant and assist social integration by subduing other tribes. The earliest annals of the highest of human races, the Aryan, certainly bear wit ness to extreme ferocity, checked and determined in its direc tion by a moral sense further developed than that of savages. While recognizing, therefore, the value of Mr. Darwin's sug gestion, so far as it goes, I believe that the true explanation lies much further beneath the surface. It will be remembered that, when treating of the parallel evolution of the mind and the nervous system,* it was shown that the increase of intelligence in complexity and speciality involves a lengthening of the period during which the nervous connections involved in ordinary adjustments are becoming or ganized. Even if the physical interpretation there given should turn out to be inadequate, the fact remains undeniable, that while the nervous connections accompanying a simple intelligence are already organized at birth, the nervous connections accompany ing a complex intelligence are chiefly organized-after birth. Thus there arise the phenomena of infancy, which are non-exist ent among those animals whose psychical actions are purely reflex and instinctive. Infancy, psychologically considered, is the period during which the nerve-connections and correlative ideal associations necessary for self-maintenance are becoming permanently established. Now this period, which only begins to exist when the intelligence is considerably complex, becomes longer and longer as the intelligence increases in complexity. * The reference is to the unpublished chapter on the Evolution of Mind.</page><page sequence="51">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 301 In the human race it is much longer than in any other race of mammals, and it is much longer in the civilized man than in the savage.* Indeed among the educated classes of civilized society, its average duration may be said to be rather more than a quarter of a century, since during all this time those who are to live by brain-work are simply acquiring the capacity to do so, and are usually supported upon the products of pa rental labor. It need not be said that, on the general theory of evolution, the passage from the short infancy of other primates to the relatively long infancy witnessed among the lowest contem porary savages, cannot have been a sudden one.f But a special reason may be assigned why Nature, which never makes long jumps, must have been incapable of making this par ticular jump. Throughout the animal kingdom the period of infancy is correlated with feelings of parental affection, some times confined to the mother, but often shared by the father, in the case of animals which mate. Where, as among the lower animals, there is no infancy, there is no parental affec tion. Where the infancy is very, short, the parental feeling, though intense while it lasts, presently disappears, and the off spring cease to be distinguished from strangers of the same species. And in general the duration of the feelings which insure the protection of the offspring is determined by the duration of the infancy. The agency of natural selection in maintaining this balance is too obvious to need illustration. Hence, if long infancies could have suddenly come into exist ence among a primitive race of ape-like men, the race would have quickly perished from inadequate persistence of the pa rental affections. The prolongation must therefore have been gradual, and the same increase of intelligence to which it was * Possibly there maybe a kindred implication in the fact that women attain maturity earlier than men. t In this connection it is interesting to observe that the phenomena of infancy seem to be decidedly more marked in the anthropoid apes than in other non human primates. At the age of one month the orang-outang begins to learn to walk, holding on to convenient objects of support, like a human infant. Up to this time it lies on its back, tossing about and examining its hands and feet. A monkey at the same age has reached maturity, so far as locomotion and prehension are con cerned. See Mr. Wallace's interesting experience with an infant orang-outang, in his Malay Archipelago, Vol. I. pp. 68-71.</page><page sequence="52">302 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. due must also have prolonged the correlative parental feelings, by associating them more and more with anticipations and memories. The concluding phases of this long change may be witnessed in the course of civilization. Our parental affec tions now endure through life ; and while their fundamental instinct is perhaps no stronger than in savages, they are, nevertheless, far more effectively powerful, owing to our far greater power of remembering the past and anticipating the future. I believe we have now reached a very thorough and satisfac tory explanation of the change from gregariousness to sociality. Bear in mind that I am not indulging in pure hypothesis. The prolongation of infancy accompanying the development of in telligence, and the correlative extension of parental feelings, are facts established by observation wherever observation is possible. And to maintain that the correlation of these phe nomena was kept up during an epoch which is hidden from observation, and can only be known by inference, is to make a genuine induction, involving no other assumption than that the operations of nature are uniform. To him who still believes that the human race was created by miracle in a single day, with all its attributes, physical and psychical, compounded and proportional just as they now are, the present inquiry is, of course, devoid of significance. But for the evolutionist there would seem to be no alternative but to accept, when once pro pounded, the present series of inferences. For the process here described, when long enough continued, must inevitably differentiate and integrate a herd or troop of gregarious ape-like men into a number of small family commu nities such as are now found among the lowest savages. The prolonged helplessness of the offspring nmst keep the parents together for longer and longer periods in successive epochs ; and when at last the association is so long kept up that the older children are growing mature while the younger ones still need protection, the family relations begin to become perma nent. The parents have lived so long in company, that to seek new companionships involves some' disturbance of engrained habits ; and meanwhile the older sons are more likely to con tinue their original association with each other than to estab</page><page sequence="53">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 303 lish associations with strangers, since they have common objects to achieve, and common enmities, bequeathed and acquired, with neighboring families. As the parent dies, the headship of the family thus established devolves upon the oldest, or bravest, or most sagacious male remaining. Thus the little group gradually becomes a clan, the members of which are united by ties considerably stronger than those which ally them to members of adjacent clans, with whom they may in deed combine to resist the aggressions of yet further outlying clans, or of formidable beasts, but towards whom their feelings are usually those of hostile rivalry. It remains to add, that the family groups thus constituted differ widely in many re spects from modern families, and do not afford the materials for an idyllic picture of primeval life. Though always ready to combine against the attack of a neighboring clan, the mem bers of the group are by no means indisposed to fight among themselves. The sociality is but nascent : infants are drowned, wives are beaten to death, and there are deadly quarrels be tween brothers. So in modern families evanescent barbarism shows itself in internal quarrels, while nevertheless injury offered from without is resented in common. A more con spicuous difference is the absence of monogamy in the primitive clan. It has been, I think, demonstrated, ? and for the evidence in detail I would refer to Sir John Lubbock's excellent treatise on the Origin of Civilization, and to the learned works of M'Lennan and Tylor, ? that in the primitive clan all the women are the wives of all the men. Traces of this state of things, which some of our half-educated " reformers " would fain restore, are found all over the world, both in modern savage communities and in traditional observances preserved by communities anciently civilized. There was also, as Sir Henry Maine has proved, entire community of lands and goods, and the individual possessed no personal rights as against the interests of the clan. And let us note, in conclusion, that this state of things, while chiefly brought about by the process of direct equilibration above described, is just that which natural selection must assist and maintain so long as the incipient community is small and encompassed by dangers.</page><page sequence="54">304 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. Thus we cross the chasm which divides animality from hu manity, gregariousness from sociality, hedonism from morality, the sense of pleasure and pain from the sense of right and wrong. For note that by the time integration has resulted in the establishment of a permanent family group with definite relationships between the members, the incentives to action in each member of the group have become quite different from what they were in a state of mere gregariousness. Sympathy, or the power of ideally reproducing in one's self the pleasures and pains of another person, is manifested in a rudimentary form by all gregarious animals of moderate intelligence. Not unfrequently, as Mr. Darwin shows, a baboon has been known to risk his life to save that of a comrade ; and the higher apes habitually take under their care young orphans of their own species. It is evident that this power of sympathy must be strengthened and further developed when a number of indi viduals are brought into closer and more enduring relation ships, even though these come far short of what, from our modern -ethical standard, would be termed loving. Affection in the savage clan is but partially preventive of fiendish cruelty ; yet there is an ability in the members to understand each other's feelings, and there is a desire for the approbation of fellow-clansmen. Kinship in blood, as well as community of pursuits and interests, promotes these feelings. Even to day we can usually understand the mental habits, desires, and repugnances of our own immediate kindred better than we can understand those of other people unrelated to us, e,ven though circumstances may now and then have led us to prefer the society of the latter. We can more readily admire their excellences and condone their faults, for their faults and excel lences are likely to be in a measure our own. Given this rudimentary capacity of sympathy, we can see how family integration must alter and complicate the emotion al incentives to action. While the individual may still exer cise his brute-like predatory instincts upon strangers and lower animals, and will, indeed, be more highly approved the more he does so, on the other hand there is a curb upon his exercise of them within the limits of the clan. There is a nascent pub lic opinion which lauds actions beneficial to the clan, and</page><page sequence="55">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 305 frowns upon actions detrimental to it ; though for this it is not necessary that there should be a generalization .of the effects of certain actions, any more than a generalization of the effects of hunger is needed to insure the individual's approval of eat ing. The mere present sense of collective pleasure or pain is enough to organize the complex feeling. - For example, when a marauding expedition upon a neighboring clan is defeated by the cowardice or treachery of one of the party, the offender is perhaps beaten, kicked, or killed. The present sense of col lective pain immediately prompts the actions which tend to re press the cowardice or treachery. On the other hand, the pleasurable states which result in all the members of the clan, in common, after an exhibition of successful bravery, immedi ately generate approval of the man who is brave, along with the desire to imitate him. In,short, ? to quote Mr. Spencer, ? one of the things that come to be strongly associated in the mind of the young savage, with marks of approval, " which are symbolical of pleasures in general, is courage ; and one of the things that come to be associated in his mind with frowns and other marks of enmity, which form his symbol of unhappiness, is cowardice. These feelings are not formed in him because he has reasoned his way to the truth that courage is useful to the tribe, and by implication to himself, or to the truth that cowardice is a cause of evil. In adult life he may, perhaps, see this ; but he certainly doe.s not see it at the time when bravery is thus associated in his consciousness with all that is good, and cowardice with all that is bad. Similarly there are produced in him feelings of inclination or repugnance towards other lines of conduct that have become established or inter dicted, because they are beneficial or injurious to the tribe ; though neither the young nor the adults know why they have become established or interdicted. Instance the praise worthi ness of wife-stealing and the viciousness of marrying within the tribe." * In these ways the establishment of permanent family relationships generates new incentives to action, un known in the previous epoch of mere gregariousness, which must often, and in some instances habitually, overrule the merely animal incentives comprised in personal pleasures and * Spencer, Recent Discussions, p. 23.</page><page sequence="56">306 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. pains. The good of the individual must begin to yield to the good of the community. Next in order comes the genesis of the feelings of regret and remorse, which are the fundamental ingredients of conscience. This part of the subject has been ably treated by Mr. Darwin, whose chapter on the Moral Sense is one of the most profound and suggestive chapters in his recent work on the " Descent of Man." Mr. Darwin points to the important fact, that, while the incentives to actions beneficial to the community are always steadily in operation, on the other hand the purely selfish im pulses, although frequently strong enough to acquire temporary mastery over the others, are nevertheless accompanied by pleas ures that are brief in duration and leave behind memories of comparatively slight vividness. Now, when intelligence has progressed to a point where there is some definite memory of particular past actions, the workings of the mind, with refer ence to conduct, begin to assume a more strictly moral charac ter. Though at the moment of action a man may yield to the desire of gratifying hunger, or revenge, or cupidity, at the cost of violating the rules enforced by social sanctions, yet after wards, when " past and weaker impressions are contrasted with the ever-enduring social instincts, retribution will surely come. Man will then feel dissatisfied with himself, and will resolve, with more or less force, to act differently for the future. This is conscience ; for conscience looks backward and judges past actions, inducing that kind of dissatisfaction which, if weak, we call regret, and, if severe, remorse.77 * All these varieties of incentive are next reinforced by incen tives of a mysterious and supernatural character. When intel ligence has progressed to the point where some curiosity is felt concerning the causes of phenomena, ? a point barely reached by the lowest contemporary savages, ? mythologies begin to be framed. A mythology is a rudimentary cosmic philosophy ; and let me note, in passing, that an uncivilized race must have attained considerable latent philosophic capacity before it can construct a rich mythology, ? instance the luxuriant folk-lore of Greece as contrasted with the scanty mythology of savages. Now, the earliest kind of philosophy is fetichism, by which * Descent of Man, I. 87.</page><page sequence="57">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 307 natural phenomena are attributed to the volitions of countless supernatural agencies. What are these agencies ? Recent re searches have elicited the fact that they are supposed to be the ghosts of the dead ancestors of the tribe. The dead chief, who appears to the savage in dreams, is supposed to rule the winds and floods, and to visit with his wrath those who violate the rules of action established in the tribe. When one of Mr. Dar win's companions, in Terra del Fuego, shot some birds to pre serve as specimens, a Fuegian present exclaimed, " O Mr. Bynoe, rain much, much wind, blow much ! " thus indicating his belief that the wasting of food, condemned by tribal rules, would be visited with condign punishment by the tutelar deities of the tribe. " This transfigured form of restraint," says Mr. Spencer, " differing at first but little from the original form, is capable of immense development." As the fetichistic agencies are generalized into the deities of polytheism, and these in time are summed up in a single anthropomorphic deity, there slowly grows up the theory of a hell in which actions con demned by the community will be punished. The complex conceptions of good and evil are thus so widely differentiated from the simpler conceptions of pleasure and pain, that the traces of the original kinship are obscured. This kind of re straint has not ceased to operate upon numbers of civilized men at the present day ; and theologians tell us that, if it were removed, there would ensue a moral retrogression. So doubt less there would, if it could be removed prematurely. Returning to our savage, it may be observed that these com bined agencies have enforced upon him an amount of self restraint, in view of tribal sanctions, which differentiates him widely from any gregarious animal. Savages are not unfre quently capable of extreme devotion and self-sacrifice when the interests of the tribe are at stake : instances are not rare in which they will deliberately choose to be shot rather than be tray the plans of their fellow-tribesmen. It is to such cases as these that we must attribute the discrepancies in the accounts of savage morality given by different travellers. If we do not stop to analyze the matter, such instances may seem to prove that the savage is morally on a level with us. But the analysis of countless seemingly inconsistent observations shows that</page><page sequence="58">308 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. savage virtues are, in general, confined to the clan. The same savage who will suffer torture with equanimity, rather than be tray his comrades, is also capable of the most fiendish cruelty and treachery toward the members of another clan. For the very forces which, during long ages, have brought him to the point at which he can sacrifice his own pleasure to the good of the tribe, have also been impressing upon him the meritori ousness of letting loose all his brutal instincts beyond the tribal limits. The savage has no sense of the wickedness of killing, stealing, and lying, in the abstract, or of the horrible cruelty of tying his enemy to a tree and slowly burning him to death with firebrands. To the Indians described by Mr. Parkman, such villany formed the most delightful of recrea tions. Thus, though the savage has the germ of a moral sense, which prompts him, irrespective of utilitarian considerations, to postpone his personal welfare to that of his clan, he can by no means be accredited with a fully developed moral sense. And the incentives which influence him are not what we call moral sentiments, in the strict sense of the phrase. " They are sim ply sentiments that precede and make possible those highest sentiments which do not refer either to personal benefits or evils to be expected from men, or to more remote rewards and punishments." The lower incentives have indeed continued to exert a powerful, perhaps a predominating, influence down to the present time. So long as readers are found for ethical treatises, like that of Jonathan Dymond, in which the sole ground of moral obligation is held to be the supernaturally revealed fiat of an anthropomorphic Deity ; " while sermons set forth the torments of the damned and the joys of the blessed as the chief deterrents and incentives ; and while we have pre pared for us printed instructions ' how to make the best of both worlds,'? it cannot be denied that the feelings which impel and restrain men are still largely composed of elements like those operative on the savage, ? the dread, partly vague, partly spe cific, associated with the idea of reprobation, human and divine, and the sense of satisfaction, partly vague, partly specific, as sociated with the idea of approbation, human and divine."* * Spencer, Psychology, II. 602.</page><page sequence="59">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 309 But a sound ethical philosophy regards it as degrading to per form good actions or to refrain from performing bad actions merely in order to win applause or to secure a place in heaven. Something more is needed to complete our account of the moral sense. Nevertheless, the more perilous portions of the labyrinth have been traversed, I hope, with safety, and we now need only one more clew to bring us to the light. We shall best realize the character of this additional element needed, if we consider for a moment the most general aspects of the two groups of feelings already described. While the feelings of which we first.treated under the head of pleasures and pains are purely egoistic or self-regarding feelings, on the other hand the feelings which we have lately described as underlying and forming the groundwork of the moral sense in a state of sociality have been happily characterized by Mr. Spencer as " ego-altruistic " feet ings. That is, they concern the happiness of the individual in so far as it depends- upon the feelings with which his fellow creatures regard him. The mixed feeling ordinarily known as generosity, for example, is often to a very large extent ego altruistic. " The state of consciousness which accompanies performance of an act beneficial to another is usually mixed ; and often the pleasure given is represented less vividly than are the recipient's feeling toward the giver and the approval of spectators. The sentiment of generosity proper is, however, unmixed in those cases where the benefaction is anonymous : provided, also, that there is no contemplation of a reward to be reaped hereafter. These conditions being fulfilled, the bene faction clearly implies a vivid representation of the pleasurable feelings (usually themselves representative) which the recipi ent will have." * The vivid representation of the pleasurable or painful feel ings experienced by others is sympathy ; and the additional factor to be taken into the account, in order to complete the explanation of the moral sense, is the enormous expansion of sympathy which has been due to the continued integration of communities, and to the accompanying decrease of warlike or predatory activity. A word of passing comment only is needed * Spencer, Psychology, II. 613.</page><page sequence="60">310 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. for the cynical theory that sympathy is but an ethereally refined selfishness, and that when we relieve a fellow-creature in dis tress we do it only because it pains us to see him suffer. This is true ; but when the pain occasioned by the sight of another's suffering, or by the idea of suffering and wrong when general ized and detached from the incidents of particular cases, becomes so strong as to determine our actions, then the chasm is entirely crossed which divides us psychically from the brutes. Between the Fiji, who keenly relishes the shrieks of his human victim, and Uncle Toby, who could not kill a fly and pitied even the Devil, the difference has come to be generic. And when this kind of self-pleasing is carried so far as to lead a man to risk his life in the effort to rescue a stranger, or per haps even an enemy, from fire, or drowning, it is so widely removed from what we mean when we speak of selfishness as to be antithetical to it. We do not describe the workings of Shakespeare's genius as reflex actions, though all intel ligence was originally reflex action. Neither are we justified in describing as selfish the actions which are dictated by sympathy, though all sympathy is in its origin a kind of self pleasing, . As already shown in describing the chief characteristics of the evolution of society,* the primary cause which has devel oped sympathy at the expense of the egoistic instincts has been the continued integration of communities, originally mere tribes or clails, into social aggregates of higher and higher orders of complexity. For by this long-continued process the opportunities for the exercise of the altruistic feelings have been necessarily increased in number and frequency of occur rence, while the occasions requiring the exercise of the anti social feelings have become less frequent, so that the former set of feelings have become strengthened by use, while the latter have become relatively weakened by*disuse. Along with this direct and obvious effect of social integration, another effect has been wrought, indirect and less obvious. A high development of sympathy cannot be secured without a high de velopment of representativeness, so closely interrelated are our * See, for the present, the paper on " The Laws of History," above referred to, where the case is crudely stated.</page><page sequence="61">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 311 intellectual and moral natures. A very feeble faculty of im agining objects and relations not present to sense must necessi tate an absence of active sympathetic emotion, save in its crudest form. "It is a familiar fact that many men are cruel, in word or deed, because they are incapable of adequately representing to themselves the pain, physical or mental, of which they are the cause. The validity of such an interpreta tion is confirmed by the fact that even, where there is very high representative capacity, the lack of the requisite elements of personal experience will prevent the rise of sympathetic feeling. Thus it is notoriously difficult for strong and healthy people to enter into the feelings of those who are weak and nervous. These facts show that the development of sympathy is largely determined by the development of the representative faculty and by increasing width and variety of experience. With the simplest form of sympathy, such as the painful thrill felt on seeing some one in a dangerous position, contrast such a complex sentiment as the sense of injustice, and it becomes evident that the latter feeling differs from the former mainly in degree and quantity of representativeness. In the former case there is a representation of the injury or death impending over some person immediately in sight; and it is the shrinking from this detriment to the fulness of life of another person which constitutes the sympathetic feeling. In the latter case ? supposing, for example, the kind of injustice in question to be that against which English-speaking people have made pro vision in habeas corpus acts ? there is the sympathetic excite ment of that highly representative egoistic sentiment known as the love of personal freedom. At first a mere recalculation, against whatever impedes the free action of the limbs, this egoistic feeling has, through increased power of representation, developed into a dislike and dread of whatever possible com bination of circumstances may in any way, however remotely, interfere with the fullest legitimate* exercise of all the functions of physical and psychical life. To have this complex feeling sympathetically excited for persons whom one has never seen, and who are perhaps yet unborn, ? and still more, to be so far possessed by this highly generalized and impersonal sympathy as to risk one's own liberty and life in efforts to avert the pos</page><page sequence="62">312 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. sible evils which are the objects of its dread, ? implies a power of representing absent relations such as has yet been acquired by only two or three of the most highly gifted families of man kind. And manifestly the sentiments which respond to the notions of justice and injustice in the abstract, are still more remotely representative, still more highly generalized, and still more thoroughly disengaged from the consideration of concrete instances of pleasure and pain. To this expansion of the power of sympathetically represent ing feelings detached from the incidents of particular cases, until the sphere of its exercise has become even wider than the human race, and includes all sentient existence, is due our instinctive abhorrence of actions which the organically regis tered experience of mankind has* associated with pain and evil, and our instinctive approval of actions, similarly asso ciated with pleasure and increased fulness of life. It is not that, as in intellectual progress, there has been a registration of inferences, at first conscious, but finally automatic ; but it is that there has been a registration of feelings respectively awakened by pleasure-giving and pain-giving actions. And just as men's intellectual conceptions of the causes of phenom ena become more and more impersonal as they are extended over wider and wider groups of phenomena, generating at last an abstract conception of Universal Cause, so free from the element of personality that to less cultivated minds it seems atheistic ; so in like manner as the sympathetic feelings are extended over wider and wider areas, no longer needing the stimulus of present pains and pleasures to call them forth, they generate at last an abstract moral sense, so free from the element of personality that to grosser minds it is unintelligible. The savage cannot understand the justice which he sees among Europeans, and the mercy of the white man is ascribed by him to imbecility or fear. To him some personal end seems neces sary as an incentive to action. But the philanthropist finds an adequate incentive in the contemplation of injustice in the abstract. Thus the ethical theories, as well as the psychology, of the schools of Hume and Kant, appear to be reconciled in the deeper synthesis rendered possible by the theory of evolution.</page><page sequence="63">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 313 On the one hand, it is a corollary from the laws of life that actions desired by the individual and approved by the commu nity must in the long run be those which tend to heighten the life respectively of the individual and of the community. And on the other hand, it is equally true that there is a highly complex feeling, the product of a slow emotional evolution, which prompts us to certain lines of conduct irrespective of any conscious estimate of pleasures or utilities. In no depart ment of inquiry is the grandeur of the Doctrine of Evolu tion more magnificently illustrated than in the province of ethics. Before we conclude, there are one or two further points to which it seems necessary to allude. In asserting that we pos sess an instinctive and inherited moral sense, it is not meant that we possess, anterior to education and experience, an or ganic preference for certain particular good actions, and an organic repugnance to certain particular bad actions. We do not inherit a horror of stealing, any more than the Hindu inherits the horror of killing cattle. We simply inherit a feel ing which leads us, when we are told that stealing is wrong, to shun it, without needing to be taught that it is detrimental to society. Hence there is a chance for pathological disturbances in the relations between the moral sense and the actions with which it is concerned. Imperfectly adjusted moral codes arise, and false principles of action gain temporary currency. These, nevertheless, come ultimately to outrage our sympathies, and are consequently overthrown ; while the principles of action which really tend to heighten the life of society are sustained by our sympathies ever more and more forcibly, and at last be come invested with a sacredness which is denied to the others. Hence arises the ethical distinction between mala prohibita and mala in se. Finally, it is not to be denied that, when the intelligence is very high, there is likely to arise a deliberate pursuit of moral excellence, attended by a distinct knowledge of the elements in which such excellence consists. Instead of being primeval, as the cruder utilitarianism seems to have imagined, such con scious devotion to ends conducive to the happiness of society is the latest and highest product of social evolution, and becomes</page><page sequence="64">314 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. possible only when the moral sense is extremely developed. At this stage, ethical conceptions begin to be reflected back upon the conduct of the individual where it concerns solely or chiefly himself; and the self-regarding virtues, as Mr. Darwin calls them, which are quite unknown save in a high state of civilization, come into existence. The injury of one's self, by evil thoughts, intemperate behavior, or indulgence of appetite, comes to be regarded as not only physically injurious, but morally wrong; and there arises the opinion that it is selfish and wicked for one to neglect one's own health or culture. Here we approach the limits at which morality shades off into religion. For, as I shall hereafter show,* Religion views the individual in his relations to the Infinite Power manifested in a universe of causally connected phenomena, as Morality views him in relation to his fellow-creatures. To violate the decrees of nature comes to be considered a sin, capable of awakening keen remorse ; for to him whose mental habits have been nurt ured by scientific studies, the principles of action prescribed by the need for harmonizing inner with outer relations are, in the truest sense, the decrees of God. And now, having reached the terminus of our inquiry, let us look back over the course for a moment, that we may see the character of the progress we have achieved. Such a retro spect is here especially needed, because the complexity of our subject has been so great, and the range of our illustrations so wide, that the cardinal points in our argument have perhaps run some risk of getting overlaid and concealed from view, and in particular it may not be sufficiently obvious how completely we have attained the object set before us as the goal of the present chapter, namely, to explain the genesis of the psychical forces which wrought the decisive change from animality to humanity. That we may well appreciate the solid consistency of the entire argument concerning the progress from brute to man, let us therefore contemplate in a single view its various factors. We have seen that the progress from brute to man has been but slightly characterized by change in general bodily structure in comparison with the enormous change which has been * The reference is to the unpublished chapter on Science and Keligion.</page><page sequence="65">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 315 wrought in the cerebrum, and in those highest psychical func tions which stand in correlation with the condition of the cerebrum. We have seen that the development of these high est psychical functions, in all their wondrous variety and com plexity, has. consisted at bottom in the increase of the power of mentally representing objects and relations remote from sense. By the reiterated testimony of many diverse kinds of illustrative facts, we have been convinced that in mere quantity of representative capacity, with its infinitely various conse quences, the civilized man surpasses the lowest savage by a far greater interval than that by which the lowest savage surpasses the highest ape ; just as the gulf between the cerebral capacity of the Englishman and that of the non-Aryan dweller in Hin dost?n is six times greater than the gulf which similarly divides the non-Aryan Hindu from the gorilla. And we have indicated in sundry ways how this increase in representative capacity, itself a prerequisite to any high degree of social combination, has been furthered by each advance in social combination, so that the enormous psychical progress achieved since mankind became distinctly human has been mainly dependent upon that increasing heterogeneity of experience which increasing social integration has supplied. But in spite of the fact that the psychical progress achieved since mankind became distinctly human is so much greater in quantity than that which was required to carry it from ape hood to manhood, we were led to adopt the Duke of Argyll's suggestion, that the boundary was really crossed when this preliminary and less conspicuous psychical progress had been achieved. And working out the happy thought which science owes to Mr. Wallace, we concluded that this comparatively inconspicuous but all-essential step in psychical progress was. taken when the intelligence of the progenitors of mankind had .reached the point where a slight increase in representative capacity came to be of greater utility to the species than any practicable variation in bodily structure. Here our first line of inquiry ended; So far as'the mere subordination of physical to psychical modification is concerned, the character of the progress from apehood to manhood now became intelligible. But at this point we were confronted with a new question, vol. cxvii. ? no. 241. 21</page><page sequence="66">316 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. suggested by some of the conclusions obtained on our first line of inquiry. Having perceived that the intellectual progress, or increase in representative capacity, which distinguishes man from brute, is so intimately connected with man's capacity for social combination, it became needful to search for the circum stances which begot in the progenitors of mankind the capacity for a kind of social combination more definite in the character of its relationships than that quasi-social combination, not un common among mammals, which is known as gregariousness. In other words, seeing that such thinkers as Sir Henry Maine have shown that the primordial unit of society, by the manifold compounding of which great tribes and nations have come into existence, was the aboriginal family group, with its nascently ethical relationships between the members, how shall 'we explain the genesis of these family groups, which have nothing strictly answering to them, either among non-human primates or among other gregarious mammals ? The feature by which the most rudimentary human family group is distinguished from any collocation of kindred individu als among gregarious mammals is the permanent character of the relationships between its constituent members. Enduring from birth until death, these relationships acquire a traditionary value which passes on from generation to generation, and thus there arise reciprocal necessities of behavior between parents and children, husbands and wives, brethren and sisters, in which reciprocal necessities of behavior we have discerned the requisite conditions for the genesis of those ego-altruistic im pulses which, when further modified by the expansion of the sympathetic feelings, give birth to moral sentiments. Accord ingly the phenomenon which demands explanation is the ex istence of permanent relationships, giving rise to reciprocal necessities of behavior, among a group of individuals associated for the performance of sexual and parental functions. The explanation, as I have shown, is to be found in that gradual prolongation of the period of infancy, which is one of the consequences, as yet but partially understood, of increas ing intelligence. Let us observe thccausal connections, so far as we can trace them out, repeating, in brief, some of the con clusions reached in the chapter on the Evolution of Mind.</page><page sequence="67">1873.] The Progress from Brute to Man. 317 In an animal whose relations with its environment are very simple, resulting in an experience which is but slightly varied, the combinations of acts requisite for supporting life take place with a regularity and monotony approaching the monotonous regularity with which the functions of the viscera are per formed. Hence the tendency to perform these actions is com pletely established at birth in each individual, just as the tendency of the viscera to perform their several functions is pre-established, all that is required in addition being simply the direct stimulus of outward physical opportunity. And the psychical life of such an animal we call purely instinctive or automatic. In such an animal the organized experience of the race counts for everything, the experience of the individual for nothing, save as contributing its mite toward the cumulated experience of the race. But in an animal whose relations with its environment are very complex, resulting in an experience which is necessarily varied to a considerable extent from gen eration to generation, the combinations of acts requisite for supporting life must occur severally with far less frequency than in the case of the lower animal just considered. Hence the tendency to perform any particular group of these actions will not be completely established at birth in each individual, like the tendency of the viscera to perform their several func tions. On the other hand, there will be a multitude of con flicting tendencies, and it will be left for the circumstances subsequent to birth to determine which groups of tendencies shall be carried out into action. The psychical life of such an animal is no longer purely automatic or instinctive. A portion of its life is spent in giving direction to its future career, and in thus further modifying the inherited tendencies with which its offspring start in life. In such an animal the organized experience of the race counts for much, but the special expe rience of the individual counts for something in altering the future career of the race. Such an animal is capable of psychical progress, and such an animal must begin life, not with matured faculties, but as an infant. Instead of a few actually realized capacities, it starts with a host of potential capacities, of which the play of circumstance must determine what ones shall be realizable.</page><page sequence="68">318 The Progress from Brute to Man. [Oct. Manifestly, therefore, the very state of things which made psychical variation more advantageous to the progenitors of mankind than physical variation, ? this very state of things simultaneously conspired to enhance the progressiveness of primeval man and to prolong the period of his infancy, until the plastic or malleable part of his life came to extend over several years, instead of terminating in rigidity in the course of four or five months, as with the orang-outang. Upon the consequences of this state of things, in gradually bringing about that capacity for progress which distinguishes man from all lower animals, I need not further enlarge. What we have here especially to note, amid the entanglement of all these causes conspiring to educe humanity from animality, is the fact, illustrated above, that this prolongation of infancy was manifestly the circumstance which knit those permanent re lationships, giving rise to reciprocal necessities of behavior, which distinguish the% rudest imaginable family group of men from the highest imaginable association of gregarious non human primates. In this line of inquiry, which, so far as I know, has never yet been noticed by any of the able writers who have dealt with the origin of the human race, it seems to me that we have the clew to the solution of the entire problem. In this new suggestion as to the causes and the effects of the pro longed infancy of man, it seems to me that we have a sugges tion as fruitful as the one which we owe to Mr. Wallace. And the most beautiful and striking feature in this treatment of the problem is the way in which all the suggestions hitherto made agree in helping us to the solution. That same increase in representativeness, which is at the bottom of intellectual progressiveness, is also at the bottom of sociality, since it ne cessitates that prolongation of infancy to which the genesis of sociality, as distinguished from mere gregariousness, must look for its explanation. In this phenomenon of the prolonging of the period of infancy we find the bond of connection between the problems which occupy such thinkers as Mr. Wallace and those which occupy such thinkers as Sir Henry Maine. We bridge the gulf which seems, on a superficial view, forever to divide the human from the brute world. And not least, in</page><page sequence="69">1873.] The Meaning and Causes of Value. 319 the grand result, is the profound meaning which is given to the phenomena of helpless babyhood. From of old we have heard the monition, " Except ye be as babes, ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven." The latest science now shows us ? though in a very different sense of the words ? that, unless we had been as babes, the ethical phenomena which give all its significance to the phrase "kingdom of heaven" would have been non-existent for us. Without the circumstances of infancy we might have become formidable among animals through sheer force of sharp-wittedness. But, except for these circumstances, we should never have comprehended the meaning of such phrases as " self-sacrifice " or " devotion." The phenomena of social life would have been omitted from the history of the world, and with them the phenomena of ethics and of religion. John Fiske.</page></plain_text>
