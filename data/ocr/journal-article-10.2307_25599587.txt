<plain_text><page sequence="1">A New Reading of "The World Is Too Much With Us" KARL KROEBER None of Wordsworth's more than 500 sonnets is better known than "The world is too much with us." Possibly it is too familiar. The purpose of the following paragraphs is to suggest a new reading of the poem, not in order to invalidate the traditional interpretation but to remove the veil of familiarity which obscures a beautiful and in triguing work of art. The sonnet is customarily read as a lament for modern man's fail ure to enjoy and appreciate nature. By devoting ourselves to "getting and spending" we lose sight of the solace and inspiration provided for us by the natural world. Better to be a simple pagan than a</page><page sequence="2">184 KARL KROEBER money-grubbing modern.1 This interpretation could not have per sisted did it not contain much truth. Yet one may still ask if there is not more to the poem than is suggested by the conventional reading, which, for one thing, makes the sonnet expressive of a sentimental primitivism rare in Wordsworth's verse.2 The famous opening phrase in itself is not self-explanatory. The "world" might mean the natural world. That it does not we deduce from the succeeding line: the "world" is the life of "getting and spending" where "we lay waste our powers." But "getting and spending" is obviously parallel to "late and soon," a phrase that is not limited in its reference merely to human affairs in industrial cen ters. It may be, then, that "getting and spending" refers to more gen eral interchanges than those involving money. And it is certain that Wordsworth is emphasizing not "the world" but we who live in that world, which is "too much with ws," where "we lay waste our powers." Line 3 likewise suggests possible questions: "Little we see in Na ture that is ours." Doubtless this means that men don't observe much in the natural world that belongs to them. And it is reasonable to as sume, on the evidence of the following phrase, "We have given our hearts away," that Wordsworth is asserting that we love nothing in nature, nothing in nature belongs to us in the sense of being bound to us by affection. Yet this does not exclude other possibilities. Is there, 1. Probably the best and best-known commentary on the sonnet is that of Professor Douglas Bush in Mythology and the Romantic Tradition in English Poetry (Cambridge, Mass., 1937), pp. 57-58. Professor Bush treats the sonnet as valuable not alone in itself but also as the expression of a typical attitude: "In this sonnet we may find the key note of a mass of mythological poetry of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; the old antagonism between Pan and Christ has become a contrast between the ugly materialism of our commercial and industrial civilization and the natural religion, the ideal beauty and harmony, of Hellenic life" (p. 58). Even critics of very different per suasions have seldom challenged Bush's judgment?see, for example, G. Wilson Knight, The Starlit Dome (London, 1959), p. 57. The nature of the one significant hostile interpretation of Professor Hoxie Neale Fairchild is suggested by the title of his article, "Wordsworth's Doctrine of Creative Delusion," South Atlantic Quarterly, xliv (1947), 545-555. Professor Fairchild's conclusion (p. 554) seems to me hasty and arbitrary: "No man ever gained lasting power from toying with beliefs which, rightly or wrongly, he feels in his heart to be 'a creed outworn.' " Yet Professor Fair child's analysis is often perspicuous and provocative. 2. The primary general discussion of Romantic "primitivism" is Arthur O. Love joy's "On the Discrimination of Romanticisms" incorporated now in Essays in the History of Ideas (Baltimore, 1948).</page><page sequence="3">"THE WORLD IS TOO MUCH WITH US" 185 after all, anything in the natural world that is human? What in nature might belong to us as men? That these are not irrelevant questions is shown by the conclusion of the sonnet. Triton and Proteus are not "natural" beings. They are creations of the human imagination. They are mythic beings, not natural ones. They are imposed upon or put into nature by men. Whatever the sonnet "means," its structure is dramatic in the sense that it is built upon an interplay of forces that appear to be simple but are in fact complicated. If Wordsworth's presentation of modern man's relationship to nature suggests possible ambiguities, his presen tation of modern man's relationship to the ancient mythological world view is even less simple. "I'd rather be | A Pagan," exclaims the poet, but he at once defines paganism as "a creed outworn." Wordsworth would like to be what he knows he cannot be. Any sentimentality in his yearning for the more poetic attitude of earlier days is checked by his consciousness that a revival of paganism is im possible. Nostalgia will not transform the modern age of iron into a mythological golden age. One may ask, furthermore, why the "pleasant lea" provides Wordsworth with "glimpses" that make him "forlorn." The word "pleasant" suggests that the nature he sees is in itself attractive. Let us recall that "getting and spending" do not damage the natural world. Wordsworth does not assert that natural beauty is spoiled by the en croachment of urban civilization3?the kind of nostalgic complaint voiced by eighteenth-century descriptive poets. For Wordsworth "getting and spending" lay waste "our powers." "Powers" implies to most of us something more than receptive capacities, and Words worth often used the word to denominate man's active, shaping capabilities. He regrets not our destruction of natural beauty but our loss of inner strength, the strength to transform nature, to "make something" of our natural environment. Once again, if we look to the end of the sonnet we can scarcely avoid the conclusion that mod 3. Most readers, however, find an implication that industrialized society is evil be cause it despoils natural beauty. There is such an implication, because to Wordsworth it is always nature which sustains and nourishes imaginative power (though his con ception of how nature sustains and nourishes imagination changes significantly) and urbanization is by definition a despoiling or delimiting of nature. Yet exactly because Wordsworth distrusted the spread of industrialized and commercialized civilization, it is noteworthy that he submerges his objection in "The world is too much with us," where an overt complaint would appear to be appropriate.</page><page sequence="4">186 KARL KROEBER ern man lacks the power to humanize nature, to impose upon it, to put into it, anthropomorphic beings such as Triton and Proteus. Yet paganism is "a creed outworn." Wordsworth cannot be urg ing us to revive the pagan attitude in its original form. But he drama tizes the way that man can exercise powers analogous to those by which the pagans transformed the natural world into a human land scape. In lines 5-7 Wordsworth presents the natural scene in human terms which, nevertheless, are not those of classical mythology. This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon; The winds that will be howling at all hours, And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers.4 In these lines Wordsworth humanizes natural elements without falling into the rigidity of formal personification. The sea is not a feminine figure who "stands for" the ocean but a moonlit sea whose tranquility is made precious by its association with feminine loveli ness and repose. The association of nature with human feelings and human relations is subtly extended by the suggested (but not stated) comparison of the winds to young creatures, who "will be howling at all hours." Wordsworth does not personify fully nor does he fully anthropomorphize. The winds are still only when they are upgathered "like sleeping flowers." The possible familial image of the sea mother and wind-children is not allowed to crystallize (the winds are not specifically identified as children) nor to escape from the natural reality which it makes poignant and familiar: the final com parison is not to sleeping creatures but to sleeping flowers. The "hu man" adjective blends back into the "natural" noun. The pathetic fallacy of "sleeping flowers" thus appropriately concludes a near personification which demonstrates how modern man, without re turning to an outworn attitude, may not merely observe nature and enjoy the gratifying sensations it provides but can, in a sophisticated, creative fashion, humanize his natural environment, make it belong to him, make it "ours." One must emphasize that in lines 5-7 Wordsworth does not oblit erate "external" nature. His near-personification is effective precisely because (unlike full personification) it does not absorb nature into a 4- All quotations are from The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth, ed.

What, then, is the function of the sestet? Has not the poet proved his point by line 8: "For this [i.e., the humanization demonstrated in lines 5-7] ... we are out of tune"? He has proved one point, but he is asserting that by "getting and spending" we lay waste our "powers." In the sestet his "argument" is, were I a Pagan "so might I" be able to see Proteus or to hear Triton. He deliberately avoids the indicative mood because he wishes to insist that Greek mythology is dead, "a creed outworn." But, ironically, in the sestet Wordsworth does re vive a bit of classical mythology, just as in the octet he first laments that nothing in nature is ours but then humanizes the sea and the winds. The magic of the sonnet, finally, is that the last two lines do arouse in our imagination the "sight of Proteus rising from the sea" and the sound of Triton's "wreathed horn."6 This magic is accom plished by the poet's firm and fully conscious rejection of that kind of revivalism of the antique favored by neoclassic artists. The pagan world is dead; paradoxically, only by recognizing that it is dead can we revitalize it.7 In lines 5-7 Wordsworth dramatizes how one can?even in the modern world?humanize one's natural environment. In the last lines of the poem he dramatizes how one can, as it were, humanize 5. An illuminating discussion of Wordsworth's attitude toward personification and the pathetic fallacy is to be found in Professor Meyer Abrams, The Mirror and the Lamp (New York, 1953), pp. 290-292. Professor Abrams also provides a good summary of eighteenth-century assumptions about the place and value of personification (pp. 285-289) and some pertinent suggestions as to the treatment of personification in Ro mantic critical theory (especially p. 55). 6. De Selincourt, Poetical Works of Wordsworth, m, 424, cites Colin Clout*s Come Home Again as the principal source for Proteus (though Paradise Lost, m, 603-604, is mentioned as relevant), Triton, and the "pleasant lea." Plainly Wordsworth's chief memory of Spenser's poem is to what W. L. Renwick (Edmund Spenser, London, 1925, p. 125) calls "the Ovidian horror of the sea," a passage concerned with the "natural" world become alien; yet when penetrated by the voyager, this strange familiar world becomes the source of new wonders and beauties. Bush, pp. 57-58, be sides citing the sources mentioned above, draws attention to the relevance of Proclus. 7. Professor Basil Willey, "On Wordsworth and the Locke Tradition," The Seven teenth Century Background (London, 1950), pp. 296-309, has shown how important to Wordsworth's art is his "negative" tradition, that is, the literary heritage that left him suffering from a "deprivation of mythology."</page><page sequence="6">188 KARL KROEBER time, restore vanished attitudes and accomplishments. Proteus and Triton are dead divinities. In the very act of recognizing them to be dead (surrendering the neoclassic pretense that they possess contem porary reality) we can for an evanescent moment revivify them and give them immediate reality. We can thus recapture the imaginative success of antiquity, resurrect its principal artistic attainment. This process of imaginative restoration through conscious recognition of loss is analogous to the process by which one humanizes nature. By not pretending that nature is human?the "pretense" of full personi fication, a favorite neoclassic device?and by admitting that "little we see in Nature ... is ours," we can become in "tune" with nature, can associate natural objects and human feelings. This association the ancient pagans achieved, as it were, naively. We cannot be so innocent. We must understand ourselves and our position in the natural world if we are to be anything but "forlorn." Thus Wordsworth laments not so much our separation from nature as our failure to recognize our separation from nature. He is, in short, more interested in imagination than in industrialization. The world may be too much with the natural scientist or the practitioner of neo classic poetry as well as the urban businessman. This reading, it may be observed, brings "The world is too much with us" close to the central current of Wordsworth's intellectual and artistic development. In "Peele Castle," for example, he insists that only through full recognition of what we lose and what is taken from us can we attain the mature insight which finds hope and beauty in a natural world that is not of itself beneficent to man. "The world is too much with us" should serve to remind us, in fact, how rarely Wordsworth wavered in his belief that the individual imagination is more important than the world?natural or social?in which it operates.
