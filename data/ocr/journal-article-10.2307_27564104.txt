As the last stage of this process, Hermes attaches seven strings to the newly fashioned instrument. In the text given above, that of F. Cassola, ovpL&lt;f)ojvovs is commonly interpreted as 'harmonious', or as Cassola puts it, 'concordi', 'con sonan ti', 'in armonia fra loro'.1 If the adjective is to be understood in this way, then it is best taken as proleptic: Hermes stretched the strings so as to make them well-tuned. The verse is cited in the first part of Antigonus of Carystus' Mirabilia with the variant drjXvrep v instead of ov?jl(J)ojvovs.2 The author attempts to show that there is * I would like to thank Jenny Strauss Clay, Edward Courtney, David Kovacs and Cg's anonymous reviewer for their comments on earlier drafts of this paper. Needless to say, any error of judgement or fact remains solely mine. 1 See F. Cassola, Inni omerici (Milan, 1975), 520. 2 Throughout this note I assume that the author of the Mirabilia is indeed Antigonus of Carystus, the biographer of philosophers who were his contemporaries, sculptor, and art historian associated with the court at Pergamon. Antigonus' identity is a long-standing question; see U. v. Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Antigonos von Karystos, Philologische Untersuchungen 4 (Berlin, 1891); for an overview of the problem's history, see T. Dorandi, Antigone de Caryste. Fragments (Paris, 1999), xi-xxxii, who follows Wilamowitz in identifying Antigonus the bio grapher with Antigonus the sculptor, but Musso in denying Antigonus' authorship of the Mirabilia; cf. also G. Schepens and K. Delcroix, Ancient paradoxography: origin, evolution, production, and reception', in O. Pecere and A. Stramaglia (edd.), La letteratura di consumo nel mondo greco-latino. Atti del convegno internazionale Cassino, 14-17 setiembre 1994 (Cassino, 1996), 401 with nn. 89-90. For the view that Antigonus of Carystus was not the author of the Mirabilia, already advanced by R. K?pke, De Antigono Carystio (Berlin, 1862), see O. Musso, 'Sulla struttura del Cod. Pal. Gr. 398 e deduzioni storico-letterarie', Prometheus 2 (1976), 1-10, who maintains that the collection was composed in Byzantine times as part of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus' project, and id., Mich?le Psello, Nozioniparadossali (Naples, 1977), 17, where he proposes that the genre of 'paradoxography' did not even exist in antiquity, but the collections that we have are late Byzantine with false names ascribed to them. P. Oxy. 11.218 (MP3 2184, third century A.D.), however, may belong to a paradoxographic work, see Schepens-Delcroix (above), 385-6 and 433, n. 198, while the existence of such works is attested by Gell. 9.4.1-4. For Antigonus' works on art see Dorandi (above), lxxxiii-cxx and 35-7. The most recent edition of the Mirabilia is O. Musso, [Antigonus Carystius], Rerum Mirabilium Collectio, Collana di Studi e Testi 12 (Naples, 1985); line 51 of h.

And what better proof than the words of the Poet himself!3 The only other author to mention this distinction is the so-called Paradoxographus Palatinus (ch. 20.1-4), but he does not provide an independent source for this notion.4 Editors of h.Merc. generally print the manuscript reading ovficfrcovovs, while Antigonus' 6r?XvTepojv is consigned to the apparatus criticus. Gemoll (following Baumeister and Franke) regarded 6rjXvT p v as a conjecture of Antigonus',5 but B?cheier and Guttmann considered it the genuine reading.6 H. Evelyn-White introduced it into his text,7 while Allen, Halliday and Sikes held a middle view: they printed ovpL^oovovs in their text, but in their introduction suggested that it could be an interpretation of dr)XvT p v* To be sure, both variants present difficulties. If the manuscript reading is adopted, this would be the first occurrence of ovpL(f&gt;ojvos, which does not reappear in archaic epic or elegy.9 6rjXvT p v, on the other hand, is a form that occurs only in later authors. Homer, Hesiod and the poet of h. Cer. use OrjXvrepd v for the feminine genitive plural and always at verse-end. The adjective, moreover, is reserved only for women or goddesses, not female animals. For them 6r?Xeiai is used, which in fact we meet in lines 192 and 494 of h.Merc.10 It is impossible to exclude either epithet on the basis of these arguments, for h. Merc, abounds in a-na?, Xeyopueva and words used for the first time or in a different sense than in Homer and/or Hesiod. Hence, I shall show first how meticulous Antigonus is in his quotations; and second, by examining the use of GVfjL&lt;f)covos (and cognates) of an instrument's strings, that gvjjl^ojvovs is unlikely to have been the original reading. For brevity's sake, only few cases of Antigonus' citations will be considered here. 3 This is our only indirect testimony to h. Merc. It is also our second oldest citation of any of the Homeric Hymns, the oldest being Thuc. 3.104, which cites h.Ap. 146-50 and 165-72. 4 For the Paradoxographus Palatinus, see K.

The only forms of drjXvrepos attested in archaic epic are OrjXvrep? v (1 lx, always modifying yvvaiK v and almost always at line-end), drjXvrepaL (2x), and dr?Xvr?pj]OL (3x). Both QrfXvr?p v and OrjXvrep? v are, of course, admissible in the hexameter.</page><page sequence="3">SHORTER NOTES 739 In chapter 21.1 of the Mirabilia Antigonus reports: 77 Si ?ecuva Sis ov kvlok toll' tols y?p ipi?pvoLS, cos (frrjcnv * HpoSoTos, ovveK?aXXet ras pLrjrpas. This is a reference to Hdt. 3.108.12-5, rj Si Srj Xicuva, i?v icxvporaTov Kal OpaovTCLTov, airat; iv too ?ico tlkt i iv tlktovocl y?p avveK?aXXei too t?kvoj to\s pafjTpas. It is evident that Antigonus makes an effort to keep his wording close to that of his source: he repeats Herodotus' ovveK?dXXei . . . t?s ?uqrpas, while replacing the plain sounding to} t?kvoj with the more technical sounding tols ipi?pvois. Furthermore, the overall construction is identical: the female lion is introduced in a oV-clause, which is followed by an epexegetic y?p-clause. tcv?otcerai reveals another way whereby Antigonus attempts to remain faithful to his source. The verb is surely meant to pick up 7nKv?oK o0ai 'to become doubly pregnant', that is, to conceive while still pregnant, which Herodotus uses of the rabbit a few lines earlier in the same chapter. Thus, instead of simply paraphrasing by using the common verb tlktclv or perhaps kv lv, Antigonus retains the unusual language of the text from which he is excerpting. The phrase i?v . . . OpaavraTov, however, is not included because Antigonus is not interested in scientific or other explanations of the wonders that he discusses.11 The same is true also of Antigonus' poetic quotations, as has been convincingly shown by O. Musso.12 Antigonus faithfully reproduces his poetic originals and in those cases where we can check against another branch of the tradition the mistakes are due to the transmission of Antigonus' text. The following examples should suffice. Antigonus' citation of Od. 14.31 in chapter 24 ?% to K pSoovvr?, GKr?7TTpov S? o? K7T G x iP?s agrees with the majority of the manuscripts (except G C D, which transmit e/c?aAe, clearly inappropriate in this context). In chapter 21 he cites Hes. Op. 524: rjjuart xei/xepia&gt;, 6t' olvootzos ov tt?Sol TepLvei, but Tepivei is clearly a scribal error for rcvSet. Antigonus introduces the quote with a paraphrase, which indicates that TevSei was intended.13 Similarly, Philet. fr. 16 CA, quoted in chapter 8.2, is affected by a common error, the supplanting of a word by its gloss: yrjpvoaiTo Si ve?pos ?no ?ojrjv ?Xeoaoa, / o?eirjs kclktov TvpLpua &lt;f&gt;vXa^a?jb vrj. This fragment is transmitted also by Ath. 2.71a, with ifivx^v instead of ?ojtjv, the latter being a gloss on the former.14 Antigonus' general fidelity to his sources strongly suggests that he read drjXvTepcov. It is hard to imagine that he would make a conjecture or commit a slip of memory on the specific word that constitutes the point he is making. The credibility of the type of literature in which Antigonus is engaging depends on the use of good written sources that prove the validity of the paradoxical stories he is narrating. His insistence on reliable documentation is evident throughout his work and it sometimes even leads 11 On Antigonus' avoidance of scientific explanations, see C. Jacob, 'De l'art de compiler ? la fabrication du merveilleux: sur la paradoxographie grecque', Lalies 2 (1983), 132 and, Schepens Delcroix (n. 2), 391-4-. Further examples of prose authors carefully cited can be found with the aid of Musso's apparatus fontium. 12 See O. Musso, 'Citazioni poetiche nello pseudo-Antigono', Prometheus 5 (1979), 83-90, from whom I draw my examples. 13 o Si ttoXvttovs iv r ^etjLtc?vt r?s TrXeKr?vas avrov Kareodie? rovre eoriv KrX. rivSei is indispensable in this citation, since it is precisely this word that proves the point Antigonus makes in his introduction to the quote. KareoOUiv may be used as a synonym of rivSeiv, 'to gnaw at', especially in later Greek, see LSJ, s.v. Kareodi 3 and 4. Schol. Ar. Pax 1009 transmits rivdei as a variant reading for this verse, see M.

The fact that ovpL(f&gt; vos (as also the negative aov?x&lt;^ojvos) is very rarely used of an instrument's strings provides an additional reason to suspect the manuscript reading. LSJ list only line 51 of h.Merc. for ov^ojvos used of strings, but there exist a few more cognate examples, all of which are rather late and seem to derive from technical terminology. In Comp. 11.39, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, attempting to show that everyone?even the crowds that fill the theatres?possesses a natural feeling for harmony, mentions the following example: KLdapLorr?v re ayadov a(j&gt;?bpa evSoKLpLodvra ISojv Oopv?rj?dvra vtto too ttXyjOovs, otl [ilav \ophr)v aovfji^ojvov Kpovo Kal SU(f)? Lp v to pu?Xos . . . The meaning of aov?x&lt;j&gt;ojvov must be 'not agreeing', that is, inappropriate to the particular song or tune, hence false.17 In other words, the performer simply struck the wrong string.18 Another example comes form ps.-Galen, Ad Gaurum quomodo animetur fetus 11.4.1-5: ojo-n-ep Si at avvapfjuoodeioai XopSai, KOLV pucLKpav ?AA^Acov arriyoioi, Kapcfrojv imrcOevTC?v irri re avr?s Kal r?s ttXtjolov?eorojoav 8i at TrXr?o?ov ?ovpL&lt;j&gt;ojvoL?puas r v ovpicfr vojv Kpovodeiorjs ?varraXXovTai Kal r? Kapfirj a7roaetovrat, rjpepiovo v Si r v irXiqoiojv Kal ?rraQcov 8t? rr)v ?ovfjLcfrojviav puevovoojv. In this passage the adjectives refer to strings tuned at such intervals that allow them to resonate when just one of them is plucked.19 Finally, in Arr. Epict. diss. 3.16.5 we read: e^et ris vpucov rrapaoKevrjv oiav 6 KidapioriKos rrjv Xvpav Xa?ojv, c?ot evdvs aifj?pL vos r v x?P&amp;?)v yv vai r?s ?ovpi&lt;f)OJvovs Kal appLooaadai r? b'pyavov; that is, strings 'out of tune', which a skilled musician can restore to their proper pitch. Of all the aforementioned meanings, the first two are certainly improbable in our context. 'Not harmonious' or 'not agreeing with a particular tune' is not appropriate because no tune exists yet with which the strings could accord. In fact, as Apollo observes later, the music produced by the lyre is quite novel.20 On the other hand, the 15 Cf. Mirabilia 45 (criticism of Callimachus' mistaken application of the epithet a/x^iyirr?ei?); 145-6 (adding some sources not mentioned by Callimachus); 161.2 (adding a detail which both Callimachus and Eudoxus omit). See also Wilamowitz (n. 2), 165-6 and Schepens-Delcroix (n. 2), 382-9. 16 The idea that the sound produced by a male differs from that produced by a female is found in Aristid. Quint. 3.20: ttjs y?p ?p,o?as 7rXr?yrjs otto t ?vSpos Kal yvvaiKOs TraiS?s t kol npeo?vTov yivofx?vr]s av?puoLov anoSiSoo?aL tov rjxov- The same author draws a distinction between masculine and feminine sounds in 2.12-14. The underlying assumption is that sound is the effect produced by a striking of the air, ?epos 7rXr?yrjv 1.4, and the sound's qualities must be related to the source of this striking. For parallels on this subject, see F. Duysinx, Aristide Quintilien, La musique (Geneva, 1999), 219, n. 1 and T. Mathiesen, Aristides Quintilianus, On Music in Three Books (New Haven-London, 1983), 76, n. 42. 17 Rather than 'out of tune', a possible meaning for the phrase as my third example shows. The parallelism with the aulos player in 11.41-2 (oopufiov ipLirvzvoas rj pur) iriioas to OTop,a) seems to suggest that Dionysius implies a mistake on the part of the performer rather than bad tuning or any other deficiency of the instrument. LSJ s.v. ?ovpi^ vos 1.1 gloss it as 'not harmonious'. 18 Something otherwise called Slo^cuvov ?'Xkeiv, cf. Damox. fr. 2.61 KA (ZvvTpo^oi). 19 Cf. Plot. 4.4.41.4-6, who illustrates the concept of to ovparaOis through the example of the strings. 20 Cf. h. Merc. 443-6.</page><page sequence="5">SHORTER NOTES 741 text does not offer any indication that gvjjlc/hjovovs should be taken to mean that the strings are tuned at intervals that would allow them to resonate. The third meaning, in harmony with each other, that is, 'well-tuned', although plausible,21 is attested only in a rather late source and, if I am not mistaken, does not occur in earlier texts, certainly not in archaic literature. avpb&lt;f&gt;ojvos in classical Greek refers generally to sounds, tones, songs in the sense of 'harmonious', 'melodic', 'echoing', or 'in concord'.22 Finally, further arguments from the hymn as a whole support my thesis. All the animals mentioned in h.Merc. are feminine. The tortoise is characterized as ip?eova, an epithet reserved for young women,23 and is envisioned as SaiT?s kraipr] in line 31. Furthermore, in lines 478ff. the tortoise as lyre is described in anthropomorphic terms, as a hetaira attending an aristocratic banquet. The cows that Hermes steals from Apollo are also feminine. Whereas according to Ant. Lib. 23.3, Hermes steals 112 female cows and one bull, the poet of h.Merc. makes a point of informing us thrice within a few lines that the divine babe stole only female animals while the bull was left behind.24 The bees are, of course, also feminine: in lines 552-4 they are referred to as three maiden sisters. OrjXvTepcov would, then, add another kind of female animal to this group, the ewes, and their presence would conform to the general pattern in this hymn, namely that the 'feminine' element is instrumental to Hermes' advancement. The tortoise provides the carcass necessary to build the lyre; by stealing and exchanging the cows, Hermes acquires some of his divine honours and ultimately forces his way into the Olympian order; the bee-maidens are Hermes' share to prophecy, an additional honour otherwise the domain of Apollo. The ewes would provide the young god with the strings necessary for fashioning the lyre.25 Thus, the female animals offer in this poem the material, while Hermes functions as the creative force26 that transforms this material into something useful for himself.27 21 See above p. 737. 22 See LSJ s.v. ovp,&lt;f&gt;ojvos 1.1 and 2 for relevant examples. 23 Cf. Hes. Theog. 245, 251, 357; fr. 169.1; h.Cer. 109; Emp. fr. 122.10 DK; Ibyc. fr. 282a 44-5 PMG, however, uses it of Troilus' handsomeness. 24 The version of Ant. Lib. runs: efoa 8' aneXavvei -rropTias S?SeKa Kal ckotov ?ovs aboyas Kal Tavpov o? to?s ?ovolv iiri?aive. Note too that in Ovid's account, although Hermes seems to be stealing only cows, he offers to Battus a cow along with a bull when he tests his trust worthiness (cf. Met. 2.701 iuncta suopariter dabitur tibifemina tauro). To these cf. h.Merc. 192, 195-6, 200. 25 In Apollod. 3.113 the strings are made from the intestines of the two slaughtered cows, which however does not affect the present argument. Apollod. narrates the hymn's two main events in reverse (and in what would seem a more logical) order. Furthermore, it is quite possible that he did not base his account on h. Merc, alone, as he includes details not found in the hymn (e.g. Apollo interrogating the Pylians or Hermes consuming some of the meat). 26 Hermes' creative abilities are especially emphasized in the hymn. For instance, in the episode of the cattle-theft (h. Merc. 68-86), the actual theft is merely reported in two lines, whereas the rest of the passage manifests the young god's creativity, both in the way he drives the cattle away and in his fashioning the wondrous sandals from material readily available in his surrounding. His involvement in creation is further indicated by the fact that he assumes the tutelage over the animals of pasture and oversees their reproduction, cf. h.Merc. 493^1; also Hes. Theog. 444 (where he shares the same function with Hecate); Paus. 2.3.4; and his by-name av?iSiqpLos trans mitted by Hsch. 27 A related idea, namely that the feminine provides the material while the masculine supplies the creative force, the masculine operating on the feminine as an artisan on raw material, is expressed most clearly later in Arist. Gen. an. 730a24-730b32, who uses the example of the carpenter and the wood and of the potter and the clay; cf. also Metaph. 988a 1-6.1 am well aware that this last part of my argument involves a highly controversial scholarly issue, namely the role of gender. A more detailed treatment, however, is beyond the scope of a textual note. I intend to</page><page sequence="6">742 SHORTER NOTES To conclude: Antigonus transmits the original reading of h.Merc. 51 (i.e. the one that goes back to the hymn's composer), which deserves to be adopted by editors in preference to ov?x&lt;?&gt;ojvovs. Antigonus' close adherence to both his prose and poetic sources supports this conclusion, as does the absence of any other attestation of ovpi&lt;f)ojvos (and cognates) referring to strings until later technical writing. And finally the hymn's overall emphasis on female animals as a means of Hermes' acquisition of divine honours reinforces the reading drjXvr?pojv. ov?jl(?&gt;ojvovs should be taken as a marginal intrusion that found its way into the text. In view of Antigonus' use of v&lt;f&gt;o)vos (and the Paradoxographus Palatinus' ?jl&lt;J)ojvos) vs. a&lt;/&gt;a)vos in the intro duction to this citation,28 it is not difficult to see how such a substitution may have arisen.
