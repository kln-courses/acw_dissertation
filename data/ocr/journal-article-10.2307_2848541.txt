<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EARLIEST MEDIAEVAL CHURCHES OF KIEV I BY SAMUEL H. CROSS IN COLLABORATION WITH H. V. MORGILEVSKI (KIEV) AND K. J. CONANT THOUGH the national conversion of Russia dates from Vladimir's imposition of Christianity upon both his immediate entourage and the masses after his return during the autumn of 989 from his successful attack on Kherson in the Crimea, there is also evidence that a considerable group of Christians not only existed, but had their place of worship in Kiev some forty years before this date. The lengthy commercial treaty concluded in 944 between Vladimir's grandfather, the Varangian Igor, and the Byzantine emperor Romanus Lecapenus, before the latter was deposed,' was ratified at Kiev, by such of Igor's followers as were Christians, in a certain church of St Elias, obscurely located by the old-Russian Primary Chronicle 'above the creek at the end of the Pasyn6a bese8da and the Kozarja.'2 Some scholars have believed that this church was situated in the Podol, or lower section of Kiev, beside the Dnieper on the northeastern edge of the hilly portion of the city. This is unlikely, however, since the Chronicle is clear to the effect that in the tenth century the population resided on the hills behind and south of this area.3 Furthermore, the phrase nad ru&amp;aem 'above the creek' indi- cates that the church in question was situated on an eminence, not simply on the bank of a stream (na rucae). The watercourse in question is the so-called Po- chaina, which now enters the Dnieper at the northern edge of the city, but formerly extended as a respectable stream much further south, and was separated from the Dnieper by a sandspit which continued to a point opposite the southern end of the modern Podol district. The Church of St Elias thus stood on higher ground overlooking this watercourse, and probably on the so-called Mikhailovskaya hill, where the most primitive citadel of Kiev was located. The Pasynca beseda 1 From the prominence of Romanus in the text, it is obvious that the treaty must have been nego- tiated before Romanus was dethroned (December 16-18, 944), even though ratified in Kiev later than March 1, 945, and thus after the accession of Constantine viI and his expulsion of Stephen and Constantine, the sons of Romanus, which took place on January 27, 945. 2 Laurentian Chronicle, Polnoje Sobranie Russkich Letopisei, I, 2nd ed. (Leningrad, 1926), 54: 'chrestjanuju Rus vodiga rote v cerkvi svjatago llji, jaie jestj nad rucaem konecj Pasynce bes6dy i Kozare: se bo be sbornaja cerki, mnozi bo besa Varjazi chrestjani' ('the oath of the Christian Russes was received in the church of St Elias, which is above the creek at the end of the Pas. bes. and the Koz.; for this was a parish church; for there were many Varangian Christians'). 3 Ibid., col. 55 (ad 945): 'For a stream then flowed at the foot of the hills of Kiev, and the people lived, not in the lowland, but on the hill.'</page><page sequence="2">478 Earliest Mediaeval Churches of Kiev appears to be connected with Turkish bash 'head, chief,' with an unidentified suffix in a compound meaning approximately 'garrison,' and would thus signify 'the gathering-place of the garrison,' while the Kozarja is 'the Khazar quarter.' In other words, the church of St Elias was probably situated within the old citadel formerly occupied by the Khazars' before they relinquished their hegem- ony to immigrant Varangians. It was presumably a small wooden structure of which all trace had disappeared even in the later middle ages, but it had no con- nection with the Church of St Elias the Prophet founded in the Podol in 1692 and still extant, though twice rebuilt after fires which damaged it in 1718 and 1811.2 Since there is also independent evidence dating from the middle of the tenth century that numerous Varangians had at that date been converted in Constan- tinople itself,3 it was from these converted Varangians who brought the faith back to Kiev that the Christian influence was transmitted to Vladimir's grand- mother, the princess Olga. She herself was converted and visited Byzantium in the autumn of 957. From a contemporary eyewitness account of her visit to the Greek metropolis, it is known that her suite included one Gregory, her domestic chaplain, which would indicate that she had made some formal profession of faith before her journey to Byzantium.4 It was almost exactly thirty years later that Vladimir i adopted Christianity, and by that step definitively brought the rising Kievan state into the sphere of European civilization. Prior to this date Vladimir had enjoyed abundant per- sonal relations with Christians. In his boyhood he had been brought up at Kiev under the tutelage of his grandmother Olga while his father Svyatoslav was ab- sent on his broad program of conquest on the Sea of Azov, in the Caucasus, along the Volga, and in the Balkans. His brother Yaropolk's widow, whom he subse- quently forced to join his harem, had originally been a nun in some Bulgarian convent, from which she had been removed by Svyatoslav on his first campaign south of the Danube.5 His two Czech concubines were in all likelihood Christians 1 The original of pasyn6a has obviously been contaminated in transmission by Old Russian pasynok, 'step-son.' 2 Ibid., i, i, 2d ed.

Constantine systematically calls Olga by her Scandinavian name Helga, rather than by her Christian name Helena. He is, however, concerned with ceremonial, not with religious matters. Furthermore, it was not the custom to refer to later members of the Kievan ruling house by the names of their patron saints, e.g., Vladimir (Basil), Yaroslav (George), Izyaslav (Demetrius), Svyatopolk (Michael), but rather by their native appellations. The best evidence for Olga's baptism in Constantinople is the Continuator Reginonis, ed. F. Kurze (Hanover, 1890), p. 170; ad 959: 'Constantinopoli baptizata est.' Since the continuator was in all likelihood Adalbert of Trier (ibid., pp. ix-x) who went to Russia himself and must have known Olga personally, this statement cannot be lightly disregarded. Cf. also Cedrenus, Bonn ed., ii, 329. The Kievan monk James (writing ca 1075) likewise says in his Eulogy of Vladimir (text in Golubinski, i, i, 241) that Olga was baptized in Byzantium, but (ibid., p. 242) notes that at her death on July 11, 6477 (969), she had been a Christian for fifteen years. This statement conveys the im- pression that Olga had definitely adopted Christianity before visiting Byzantium, even though she submitted to baptism there for political reasons. 5 PSRL., i, 75, 78.</page><page sequence="3">Earliest Mediaeval Churches of Kiev 479 also, since German missionaries had been active in Bohemia at least since 846 (thus prior to the arrival of Constantine and Methodius), and the faith had been firmly established there for well over a centtiry before Vladimir's conversion.' Vladimir's conquests in Volhynia also placed him in close proximity with the Poles, among whom Christianity had been introduced under the auspices of Mieszke I in 966. Though Vladimir's personal interest in religious questions is indicated by his early devotion to the pagan deities of which he is said to have caused idols to be erected at Kiev in 980,2 he was as frequently exposed to Chris- tian influences as to the vague animistic and anthropomorphic cult which pre- vailed among his Slavic subjects. Because of the close commercial relations connecting Kiev and Byzantium in the tenth century, the dignity and prestige of the Byzantine court and the splen- dor of Greek religious ceremonial were logical subjects of discussion among Varangians and Slavs who had visited the Greek capital. Now that the Khazars were no longer an important factor in Byzantine diplomacy, and since Vladimir had made himself the dominant figure in Russia, the potentate with whom he might most readily compare himself in moments of reflection was the one with whom his subjects were in most frequent material contact-the Emperor of Byzantium. The prestige which the latter derived from his association with the hierarchy was clear to all contemporary observers. But whatever may have been the motives behind Vladimir's decision to adopt Christianity, the circumstances which gave him an unparalleled opportunity to combine conversion and a close alliance with the Byzantine royal house developed in 987. Since certain phases of these events are not without bearing on the history of early Russian church architecture, it will not be amiss to rehearse them in some detail. Upon the death of the Byzantine emperor John Tzimisces in 976, he was suc- ceeded by Basil ii and Constantine VIII, the youthful sons of Romanus ii. In September, 987, a military conspiracy proclaimed as emperor Bardas Phocas, son of Nicephorus Phocas (murdered 969), and a former trusted aid of Tzimisces. Gaining control of the Asiatic themes, Bardas even occupied Chrysopolis (Sku- tari) early in 988. Bardas's military strength was formidable and the Byzantine treasury was empty. The menaced emperors during the same winter entered into negotiations with Vladimir, who contracted to supply them 6000 Varangian troops and to accept Christianity if they would give him their sister Anna in marriage. The Varangian corps arrived at Constantinople, took part in a successful com- bined naval and military engagement against Bardas's lieutenant Delphinas at Chrysopolis, and participated in the decisive action at Abydus during which Bardas lost his life on April 13, 989.3 1 Cf.

Skleros had originally planned to revolt early in 987. In spite of the fact that he was related by marriage to Bardas Phocas, the latter cut short his career as a rival by seizing and impounding him at his own castle of Tyropaeum in September of the same year.' Upon the death of Phocas, Skleros was released, gathered about him the malcontents who had followed the banners of Phocas, and proclaimed himself emperor. It was not until October, 989, that an agreement was reached with the reigning emperors whereby Skleros and his partizans were dissuaded from further revolt by the receipt of various dignities and estates.2 Faced by these dangers, the Byzantine emperors delayed in the execution of their contract with their remote Russian ally. His patience soon exhausted, Vla- dimir organized an expeditionary force for an attack on the Greek dependency of Kherson, in the Crimea three miles west of Sebastopol, which he captured in the early summer of 989.3 Thus confronted by a new fait accompli in the midst of their other pressing difficulties, the emperors capitulated, and sent Anna to Kherson. While there is some doubt as to whether Vladimir was baptized at Kiev or Kherson, the probabilities favor his formal acceptance of Christianity at this Crimean city. The Eulogy of the Monk James4 states that Vladimir captured Kherson in the third year after his baptism; this accords with the supposition that he decided to accept conversion late in 987, when diplomatic exchanges were opened by Byzantium, since the capture of Kherson in 989 actually falls within the third year thereafter. It is inevitable that the Byzantines should have insisted upon a ceremonious profession of faith by Vladimir before his marriage took place, and his assumption of the Christian name of Basil proves the domi- nance of the Greek influence at the moment of this ceremony. It is further a fact that Vladimir took no steps whatever toward converting his subjects until after he had returned from Kherson. And finally, the influence of the Khersonian clergy at Kiev during Vladimir's subsequent reign was considerable. The first church erected by Vladimir after his return to Kiev was dedicated to I Yahya, op. cit., pp. 419-423; Cedrenus, ii, 443. 2 Yahya, loc. cit., pp. 426-427. Yahya knows nothing of Cedrenus' story (ii, 447) that Skleros went blind on his way to Constantinople. He reports that Basil ii expected Skleros to accompany him on a campaign against the Bulgarians.in 990, but excused the aged rebel because of physical disability; Skleros died, in fact, on March 6, 991 (ibid., pp. 430-431). 3 The Russian annals (PSRL., i, 109) date this expedition as of 989, but that date may be cor- rected by an interesting comparison of sources. Leo Diaconus, x, 10, Bonn ed., p. 175, remarks that at this time an exceptional display of fiery pillars in the sky, i.e., aurora borealis, presaged the capture of Kherson by the Russians and of Berrhoea (Macedonia) by the Bulgars, further noting that a comet warned of a subsequent disastrous earthquake in Constantinople itself. The celestial phe- nomena are accurately dated by Yahya, who records that an auroral display was seen at Cairo on April 7, 989, and that a comet was visible for twenty days from July 29, 989 (loc. cit., pp. 432-433). Hence Vladimir's capture of Kherson took place between these two dates, and to judge both from the time necessary for communication, and from the date of Bardas' defeat and death, about the middle of the summer. 4 Cf. p. 478 n. 40 (Golubinski, i, i, 245).</page><page sequence="5">Earliest Mediaeval Churches of Kiev 481 his patron St Basil, and it was set upon the hill where his pagan idols had for- merly stood.' This edifice was probably of wood, and is generally considered to have been destroyed in the conflagration of 1017. Identifying the location of this church would be easy if it were known precisely where Vladimir's idols were set up. The Primary Chronicle states that they stood on the hill outside the teremny dvoretz, i.e. the palace with the hall.2 The same source also remarks that in Olga's day the prince's palace was inside the citadel, but adds, 'outside the citadel there was another palace, where the palace of the Cantors now is, the dvor teremny behind the [church of the] Holy Virgin, for there was a stone hall there.'3 Hence, if the dvor with the stone terem was behind the Church of the Virgin (which can only be the Desyatinnaya, built by Vladimir within the next few years, see below, pp. 483-493), and the idols were on the site of the teremnyi dvor, the primitive Church of St Basil must have stood on or near the present site of the Desyatin- naya. As far as the evidence of the Chronicle goes, the tradition which identifies the site of St Basil's with that of the modern Church of the Three Saints (Trech- svyatitelskaya, rebuilt in 1640 by Peter Mogila), further toward the edge of the hill overlooking the Podol, is erroneous, even though reference is made at the close of the twelfth century to two churches of St Basil in the immediate vicinity, one dedicated in 1184 and the other in 1198.4 Vladimir's chief architectural monument, however, was not the perishable and enigmatic chapel of St Basil, but the Church of the Virgin commonly designated as the Desyatinnaya (the Church of the Virgin of the Tithe), from the fact that Vladimir eventually endowed it with a tithe of his property. This church was begun in 991, something over a year after Vladimir's return from the raid in Kherson.5 Greek artisans w)ere especially imported, if not for its construction, at least for its decoration, and it was consecrated on May 11 or 12, 996.6 Accord- ing to the Primary Chronicle, Vladimir placed the completed church under the charge of Khersonian priests,7 and equipped it with the ecclesiastical accessories which he had acquired in the Crimea. The church was built of the so-called opus I PSRL., i, 118. 2 Ibid., col. 79. 3 Ibid., col. 55: 'i be vne grada dvor drugyi ideie estj dvor demestikov, za svjatoju Bogorodiceju dvor teremnyi, be bo tu terem kamen.' 4 PSRL., ii, 1st ed. (1843), 128, 152; both were dedicated on January 1. 5 The Eulogy of the monk James (Golubinski, op. cit., i, i, 245) states that Vladimir founded the Desyatinnaya in the fourth year after his 'baptism': 'na cetvertoe leto [po krescenii] cerkovj kamenu svjatyja Bogorodica zalozi.' We have seen (p. 480 above) that James implies Vladimir's baptism to have taken place late in the year 987, when he decided to become converted on the basis of diplomatic overtures from Basil ii and Constantine viii. D. Ainalov, Gesch. der russ. Monumentalkunst der vormoskov. Zeit (Berlin, 1932), p. 10, writes: 'Im Jahre 989 fand die Grundsteinlegung statt und schon 990 war die Kirche fertig.' The sources and chronology supply no basis for any such dating. Vladimir could not have begun this church during the early winter of 989 after his return from Kherson. 6 Makari, Ist.

Its location at the corner of the modern Korolenko St and the Street of the Victims of the Revolution (formerly Vladimirskaya and Trechsvyatitelskaya) is unques- tionable, and the remnants of the primitive structure lie under the architectur- ally undistinguished modern church demolished in 1936. From Milyeyev's dis- covery of tombs and of a wooden structure antedating the Desyatinnaya under its foundations,1 there is perhaps reason to surmise that this location was the site of a pagan shrine before the Christian period, especially since no Christian emblems were found in these early tombs. The Desyatinnaya has had an eventful history. After it had suffered seriously in the conflagration of 1017, its reconstruction was probably an element of the building program initiated by Vladimir's son and successor Yaroslav the Wise (regn. 1017-1054), since it was rededicated by the metropolitan Theopemptos in 1039.2 It was sacked by Prince Mstislav Andreyevich when he captured Kiev on March 8, 1171,3 and still more thoroughly plundered on January 2, 1203, upon the seizure of the city by Prince Rurik Rostislavich. On the latter occasion, the Laurentian Chronicle declares, the plunderers 'broke some eikons and others they seized. They also appropriated to themselves the sacred crosses, the con- secrated vessels, and the robes of the ancient princes which the latter had hung in the holy churches as a memorial to themselves.'4 Even thus despoiled, the ven- erable church was the final bulwark of Kievan resistance when the Tartars at last invested the city in 1240. A crowd of fugitives sought safety on the roof and the vaults of the Desyatinnaya, which collapsed under their weight.' During the later Middle Ages the stone of the ruins, down to most of the foundations, was largely carried away for use in other structures, so that by the time of Pefer Mo- gila, in 1635, nothing was visible of the Desyatinnaya except a fragment of the southwest corner, which Mogila caused to be included in a small stone chapel erected by him on the site. This chapel eventually fell into decay and was re- stored in 1758 by an aristocratic lady who had taken the veil in a local convent.6 'In 1820 Alexander Annenkov, a pious and wealthy retired officer of the Guards, conceived the idea of erecting a modern church on the spot. His proposal was welcomed by the metropolitan Eugenius, who in October, 1824, instigated an investigation of the extant ruins which supplied the first suggestive data on the architectural features of the primitive Desyatinnaya. The plans drawn by Stasov were accepted for the modern church, which was formally begun on August 2, I Otcety Imp. Archeologi6eskogo ObNYestva, 1908, pp. 149-151, 152-153.

The only productive modern archaeological studies conducted by means of competent excavations on the site have been those initiated by D. V. Milyeyev in 1908,1 but discon- tinued at his death. FIGUIRE 1 Plan of the Desyatinnaya, redrawn from Milyeyev The area of the church of 1828 is enclosed by a double line. While the investigators under the metropolitan Eugenius were able to work before the modern church was built, they failed to dig deep enough to secure a correct trace either of the apses or of the external walls of the east end.2 Since the foundations of the primitive edifice had to a large extent disappeared, it would have been necessary to locate the trenches in which base beams were laid in order to place these foundations exactly. As a result, the early excavators mistook a chain wall for the outside wall at the apse end and erroneously con- cluded that the central apse protruded some distance beyond the two lateral 1 OtZety Imp.

At the northwest corner also, and along the entire north side, the plan of 1826 shows a misconception of the primitive trace. Extensive fragments of mo- saic flooring and decoration were discovered in the altar-apse at this time. Bases and fragments of thick white-marble columns, as well as of capitals and moldings, were likewise found between the foundation walls of the central nave near the narthex. Milyeyev's excavations established that the southern wall of the modern church is built on the primitive foundation, while the eastern and northern walls were set upon new ones. This circumstance permitted an accurate study of the foundations of the apses and of the north side, as the primitive north wall lies 4 meters outside the modern one. But since Milyeyev was prevented by the pres- ence of the modern structure from studying more than a limited section of the periphery of the primitive edifice, his researches provide comparatively little information on which a conception of the original external aspect of Vladimir's church can be based. Milyeyev's excavations were of special interest for their determination of the unique character of the foundations of both the apses and the main walls of the Desyatinnaya. In constructing the apses, a pit was dug large enough to include the whole space they would occupy. In this pit two rows of wooden beams were laid crosswise and ballasted with yellow sandstone rubble, after which mortar was poured over the whole to form a level base. On this base was set the masonry of the apses, and the free space left in the pit was filled in to the ground level with earth mixed with large pieces of yellow sandstone. The surface level at the time the tenth-century church was built lay 1.1 meters below the modern level, and the foundations were set at a depth of 1.4 meters below the contemporary surface of the ground. Substantially the same procedure was followed in laying the base for the main walls. The base clay of the site preserved the lengthwise trenches at the bottom of which were found remnants of parallel beams laid lengthwise in four rows. Series of regularly spaced wooden pegs were driven into the base clay to hold the beams in alignment. The wood of these pegs had naturally decayed away, but the clay preserved their exact form, size, and arrangement. At the intersections with the transverse walls the beams were connected by large iron spikes which were found in the excavation. As in the case of the apses, the beams under the walls were ballasted with sandstone rubble, and the extra space in the trenches was filled in after the mortar surface was poured over. Milyeyev's excavations also show that the eastern wall extended north and south from the lateral apses at the point of their greatest diameter for a distance in each direc- tion roughly equivalent to the diameter of the altar apse, indicating that the edifice was either conceived with a nave and double aisles or else reconstructed at an early date to embody two additional aisles or arcades. Such are the facts regarding the architecture of the Desyatinnaya which may be stated with complete certainty, and the paucity of these facts has encouraged various conjectures as to its silhouette. For example, Golubinski, the most dis- tinguished modern historian of the Russian church, observes in this connection, 'We have no positive evidence, but with all probability we think that it had not one dome, but five, and that in general both in plan and in form it should be</page><page sequence="9">Earliest Mediaeval Churches of Kiev 485 imagined as more or less identical with Yaroslav's St Sophia, in which it is proper to see its reproduction." Among more recent scholars, Ainalov remarks, 'Der eigentliche Grundriss hat die Form einer Kuppelbasilika, deren Typus wir in vollstaindiger Erhaltung in Cernigov wiederfinden.'2 Ainalov is inclined to as- sociate the Cathedral of the Transfiguration in Chernigov very closely with the Desyatinnaya, though the church at Chernigov was founded ca 1034, not in 1014 (as Ainalov asserts), and is thus 40 years younger than the Kievan edifice. The distinguishing features of the Cathedral of the Transfiguration are that it is a three-naved domed basilica, but with an intermediate bay between the transept and sanctuary, which has the effect of pushing the dome forward toward the west. This church also had galleries supported not only by brick piers but also by marble columns, and in its primitive form the church probably had arcades on the north and south sides (an interesting conclusion in view of Pro- fessor Conant's restoration of the most primitive aspect of St Sophia, see p. 494 and plates ii, iII below). The most recent writer on the subject, N. B3runov, con- siders that the only parts of the Desyatinnaya belonging to the tenth century are the three middle naves, and that the church was originally a basilica, as is proved by the lack of the transverse chain-walls associated with the piers of a cruciform domed church.3 Brunov also considers that, contemporaneously with the construction of St Sophia, the Desyatinnaya was also transformed into a domed church and that two additional aisles were added.4 The problem of the primitive form of the Desyatinnaya is intimately associated with a definition of the architectural influences which governed its builders. In defining these influences, however, it is well to recall that resemblances between contemporary monuments in widely separated localities do not necessarily imply any direct connection, apart from the possibility of a common tendency, unless there is conclusive evidence of actual cultural exchanges between the localities where the monuments appear. Obviously the aspect of the first important church constructed by Vladimir was largely dependent either on such churches as he himself had seen or on the ideal of a church existing in the minds of the clergy imported at the moment of conversion. The Russian sources are clear both as to the importation of priests from Kherson and as to the presence of priests from Constantinople in the suite of the princess Anna. Furthermore, there is no reason to question the testimony of Yahya of Antioch that Basil ii sent ecclesiastical dignitaries to Kiev to aid Vladimir in the work of conversion and organization.' After all Yahya, who died in 1066, was working on his history within twenty years after the capture of Kherson, and was extremely well informed as to the course of events at Byzan- tium between 985 and 990. From the standpoint of language, it is also likely (though there is not one word of direct evidence for this supposition in any source: Greek, Russian, or Arabic) 1 UJp.'8iz., It, i,-U-96.

The language problem had been till then one of the chief difficulties in the early Bulgarian church, and the propagation of the Slavic liturgy imported by the disciples of Methodius became a cardinal element of Boris's policy. Furthermore, the transmission to Russia of Bulgarian translations from the Greek during the eleventh century offers abundant evidence as to the prevalence of cultural interchanges as long as the roads were open. Yet the gravity and extent of the early Bulgarian influence can easily be exag- gerated. While it scarcely lies within the scope of the present article to refute in extenso the ingenious hypotheses of M. D. Prisyolkov,2 who saw an alliance with Byzantium in Vladimir's campaign of 985 against the Bulgars (though modern scholars are reasonably agreed that the Bulgars referred to were on the Volga rather than in the Balkans),3 and believed that the early Russian church was subject to the patriarchate of Ochrid from the days of Vladimir to the appoint- ment of the metropolitan Theopemptos to the see of Kiev in 1037,4 it is well at least to enter a caveat against this latter theory. It is in large degree an offshoot of A. A. Shakhmatov's efforts to break down the early Russian annals into hy- pothetical elements for which the evidence is extremely tenuous, and entails a rewriting of early Russian mediaeval history on the basis of conjectures and com- binations which require the closest scrutiny one by one before they can be ac- cepted without further question. In the first place, it is impossible to divorce the conversion of Vladimir from political considerations, and therefore intrinsically inconceivable that Basil ii should have immediately turned over the church founded by his ally and brother-in-law to the control of Samuel of Bulgaria, who had been invading Thrace and Macedonia annually since 980, and whose capture of Larissa in 986 and of Berrhoea in 989 were bitter blows to Byzantine pride and prestige. In the second place, the three chrysobulls promulgated by Basil after his triumphant annexation of Bulgaria' in 1018 regulate the attributes of the former patriarchate of Ochrid (now reduced to an archbishopric) in great detail, but ascribe to it no eparchy outside Bulgaria and Serbia, giving no hint whatever of any direct connection between Ochrid and Kiev. In the light of the uncertainty regarding the existence of a metropolitanate at Kiev before 1037, it I There were Bulgarians in Kievan monasteries in the eleventh century, e.g., Mina, the friend of Nikon, who left the Crypt Monastery with him in 1061, cf.

But there is no conclusive evidence of Kievan dependence on Ochrid, and a good case might even be made for the contention that intensive cultural interchanges between mediaeval Russia and Bulgaria began only after 1018, when the autocephaly of the Bulgarian church constituted a cardinal element in Basil's policy and the free transmission of Bulgarian cultural attainments to Kiev via Byzantium thus became possible for the first time since Vladimir's conversion. As far as these considerations affect the Desyatinnaya, and even though Bulgarian priests may very well have reached Kiev simultaneously with the conversion, there is insufficient historical basis for concluding that contem- porary Bulgarian architecture was alone in providing the major motives in its construction. There are at the same time, indeed, features of tenth-century Bulgarian architecture which happen to coincide with salient characteristics of certain churches in Kherson belonging to the same epoch. Reference has already been made (p. 485 above) to Brunov's opinion that the Desyatinnaya was originally a three-nave basilica. As F. I. Schmit has remarked, the absence of piers or columns to support one or several domes or of any trace of foundations for such supports of the roof.' By this period in Constantinople, however, not only the pure basilica but also the domed basilica had been re- placed by the cruciform church.2 Yet in Bulgaria the basilica without domes is conspicuously represented by such structures as the great church at Aboba (Pliska), belonging to the late ninth or early tenth century, by St Achillas' at Prespa (late tenth or early eleventh century, hence nearly coaeval with the Desyatinnaya), and St Sophia in Ochrid (founded before 1018)..3 Not only in Bulgaria but also at Kherson, the basilica was the standard type of church at the close of the tenth century,4 and if, as the Primary Chronicle relates, Vladimir founded a church at Kherson before returning home, it must have been of this character.5 Where the Bulgarian basilicas cited all have three apses those of Kher- son for the most part have only one. There are, however, four small basilicas6 in the Crimean city which show three tangent apses of the construction exempli- fied by the Desyatinnaya, though contrary to Byzantine practice. Hence in both the areas with which the Kievan church at its origin enjoyed some contact, the basilica was the prevalent type of ecclesiastical edifice at the close of the tenth century, and the Desyatinnaya may be said with almost perfect certainty to have been originally constructed on the same plan. While it is open to doubt whether Caucasian influences played any direct r6le in the erection of the Desyatinnaya, there is of course no question but that Bulgarian relations with Armenia and Georgia had been close since the eighth century, while commercial exchanges between the Crimea and the Caucasus were traditionally intimate.

In any case, however, the Desyatinnaya is indirectly related to the great domed basilicas of the Caucasus (e.g. Pitzunda) through the areas in which the Caucasian influence was more immediately exerted. The curious character of the foundations of the Desyatinnaya, which is dupli- cated in adjacent structures of the same period, shows that the builders were unaccustomed to stone architecture, since any such wooden base would be subject to decay and produce unequal settlement of the masonry resting upon it.' The actual construction work was thus performed by native artisans, not by imported talent. To the erection by Russian workmen is doubtless also due the probability that the church was constructed with a two-sloped wooden roof, which obviated the necessity of constructing a dome, the technique of which could hardly have been known to native builders at the end of the tenth century.2 The discovery of marble columns at the rear of the edifice by the excavators of 1826 might also indicate that the church possessed a gallery. It is impossible to determine with any degree of certainty what modifications were made in the Desyatinnaya during the time of Yaroslav. If the Cathedral lost its roof in the fire of 1017, it is not unlikely that it was restored with barrel vaults like those on St Sophia (cf. p. 493 below). This supposition is justified by the remark of the Hypatian Chronicle that in their flight from the Tartars the inhabitants took refuge on the komary ('vaults') of the church (cf. n. 5, p. 482). In view of the certainty that St Sophia as first constructed had a one-story arcade on its north and south sides and the likelihood that the Cathedral of the Redeemer in Cher- nigov was similarly planned (see p. 485 above and 494 below), there is some ground for the assumption that such appendages were also added to the Desya- tinnaya, since they would favor the traditional practice of making the service visible even to spectators outside the church. These features of the Desyatinnaya cannot, however, be defined with any semblance of certainty until the whole foundation has been thoroughly and competently studied, so that in these re- spects we are limited to conjectures from the examples of better-preserved con- temporary structures. Even so, it is well to recall Arthur Kingsley Porter's cau- tion that 'excavated foundations offer, at best, a large opportunity for error.' Vladimir also erected several other churches both in Kiev and the neighboring towns. In the summer of 996 the nomad Pechenegs made a raid in the vicinity of the town of Vasiliev on the river Stugna, about 25 miles west of Kiev. Vladi- mir's troop was outnumbered, so that he was obliged to take refuge under a bridge. In gratitude for his escape, the prince made a vow to erect a Church of the Transfiguration in the town, since it was on this festival (August 6) that the event had taken place. The Chronicle reports that Vladimir celebrated for eight days and returned to Kiev on the festival of the Virgin (August 15).3 Makari 1 Cf. Schmit, loc. cit., pp. 105-106. 2 Ibid., p. 109. 8 PSRL., I, 124-125.</page><page sequence="13">Earliest Mediaeval Churches of Kiev 489 has suggested that this church was of wood and considered it the first example of a so-called 'one-day church' (obydennaya tserkov), such as were frequently built in Russia from the fourteenth century forward to execute vows for the banish- ment of plagues and epidemics.' It is also supposed, though without specific source evidence, that Vladimir was responsible for the erection of the wooden church of St Basil at Vyshgorod, a northern suburb of Kiev, beside which his two sons Boris and Gleb were buried after they had been assassinated in 1015 at the instigation of their older half-brother Svyatopolk.2 According to Nestor's Life of Boris and Gleb, this church was destroyed by fire about 1020. The relics of the sainted brethren were then exhumed and de- posited in a new wooden church on the same site dedicated to them.3 In Kiev Vladimir is likewise reported to have constructed a church of St George,4 but no information is preserved of its plan or location. The conjecture is reasonable that it was a wooden church which disappeared in the fire of 1017, to be replaced by the edifice of the same name subsequently erected by Yaroslav to the west of St Sophia. The Church of the Redeemer in Berestovo (near the Pecherskaya Lavra), sometimes attributed to Vladimir, is actually an edifice of the early twelfth century (constructed of brick instead of opus mixtum, which went out of use about 1100) erected during the principate of Vladimir Monomakh.5 The first church built in Novgorod in Vladimir's day was the wooden cathedral of St Sophia, erected ca 989 (burned 1045) and interesting for its thirteen verkhi, which seem to have supplied the motive for the same number of domes on Yaroslav's St Sophia in Kiev (see below, p. 496). Some confusion has been caused by Thietmar of Merseburg's note on Kiev to the effect that in 1017 'in magna hac civitate, que istius regni caput est, plus quam quadringintae habentur ecclesiae,'6 and an exaggerated parallel to his mention of 400 churches may be found in a a report from one of the old Russian Chronicles7 that in a fire at Kiev during 1124 'nearly 600 churches' were consumed. It is not by any means to be supposed, however, that these were parish churches: they were rather small private chapels built in the courtyards and on the grounds of private residences, and were dignified by the name of churches simply because a cross adorned their gables.8 Vladimir's building program was thus by no means an extravagant one, and it was left for his son and successor Yaroslav (regn. 1017-1054) to erect the metro- politan cathedral which remains to the present day the chief Russian mediaeval architectural monument.

He founded there also the church of St Sophia, the metropolitan church, and afterward the church of the Annunciation of the Holy Virgin on the Golden Gate, then the monastery of St George and [the convent of] St Irene. And in his day the Christian faith began to bear fruit and spread abroad, and monks began to increase, and monasteries began to exist." Of the site of this church the same source remarks that in 1036 Yaroslav's crucial engagement with the nomad Pechenegs was fought 'on the spot where now stands St Sophia, the Russian metropolitan church, for there was then an open field outside the citadel.'2 These passages combined would seem to supply conclusive evidence that St Sophia was not begun until 1037. Unfortunately, however, an early chronicle of Novgorod states briefly that 'St Sophia at Kiev was founded in 1017.'3 In spite of the fact that the laconic annuals of Novgorod at this point provide only the briefest conceivable summary of Kievan events, and regardless of the obvious likelihood that a Kievan chronicler of the close of the eleventh century had every reason to be accurately informed as to the plot of ground and the date on which the city's most important edifice was erected no further back than the previous generation, the two most recent writers on this subject, D. Ainalov and N. Brunov have both preferred to accept the dates of the Novgorod annals.4 Ainalov adopts this view in order to support his hypothesis that the same Byzan- tine architects worked on St Sophia as had been engaged by Vladimir for the Desyatinnaya. As has been pointed out, however, there is no certainty that Byzantine artisans were concerned with any features of the Desyatinnaya beyond its decoration, and such Greek artisans as were employed may equally well have come from Kherson. No mention is made in the sources of the employment of Greek architects for St Sophia (cf. Professor Conant's remarks on this subject, p. 498 below), though Greek artists were certainly engaged for its mosaics and frescos. Furthermore, Ainalov bases his hypothesis upon a forced specific inter- pretation of certain general statements in a related passage of Hilarion's Dis- course on Law and Grace, a sermon containing a panegyric to Vladimir and Yaro- slav, which was delivered between 1037 and 1050,5 and probably in the Desya- tinnaya itself. According to Ainalov, Hilarion 'ausdrticklich hervorhebt, dass Jaroslav die 1 PSRL., i, 151: 'Zaloii Jaroslav gorod velikyi, u negoie grada sutj Zlataja vrata; zaloii Ae i cerkovj svjatyja Sofija, mitropolju; i posemj cerkovj na Zolotych vorotech svjatoje Bogorodice Blagov69cenie, posemj svjatago Georgija manastyrj i svjatyja Iriny; i pri semj na&amp;a v6ra chrest- janjska ploditi sja i ragirjati, i cernorizjci po6aga mnoEiti sja, i manastyreve po6inachu byti.' 2 Ibid., 'na m6sto ideie stoit; nyn6 svjataja Sofija, mitropolja Rusjskaja, b6 bo togda pole vn6 grada.' 8 Novgorodskaja Letopis po Sinodaljnomu Spisku (Spb., 1888), p. 83. 4 Ainalov, op. cit., p. 12, Brunov-Alpatov, op. cit., p. 10. r A.

The Discourse is vaguely datable from the fact that it mentions the Church of the Annunciation on the Golden Gate, built after 1037, and refers to Yaroslav's consort Irene as alive, though she died in 1050.</page><page sequence="15">Earliest Mediaeval Churches of Kiev 491 Gebote seinesVaters erfuillt und die gr'ozsstelKirche (hl. Sophia) in nordischen Lan- den erbaut habe, iihnlich wie Salomo, der die Gebote Davids erftillte.' What Hilarion literally says in his apostrophe to Vladimir is: 'A very noble witness [to thy piety] is thy son George [i.e., Yaroslav, whose Christian name was George], whom the Lord made the heir of thy sovereignty after thee, not break- ing thy injunction, but confirming it, not belittling the creations of thy piety, but rather adding to them, not destroying, but perfecting: he who is finishing thy unfinished works, as was done for David by Solomon; he who has built in his wisdom a great and holy house of God, and it stands there for the consecra- tion and adornment of thy city; he who has adorned it with every beauty, with gold and silver and precious stones and sacred vessels; which church is wondrous and glorious to all adjacent countries, and another like it will not be found in all the land of the north from east to west." While Brunov, following Ainalov, asserts that Vladimir himself planned to erect St Sophia, I doubt whether this meaning can justifiably be read into Hilarion's words. What the orator implies is that Yaroslav has followed Vladimir's policy of promoting the welfare of the church in Russia, not neglecting it but building it up. There is, moreover, nothing specific in the expression 'finishing thy unfinished works, as David did for Solo- mon'; these works were the general tasks of promoting Christian culture and adorning Kiev. It is also unlikely that Hilarion desired to press the analogy between Vladimir and David, who was forbidden to build the Temple because of the blood he had shed (I Chron., xxii, 28). Since Hilarion refers to the Church of the Annunciation, it is more than possible that 'the great and holy house of God' which he 'built in his wisdom' is St Sophia, which must have been nearly completed in its first aspect by the close of the '40's. But when Hilarion speaks of Yaroslav's finishing his father's unfinished works, 'not destroying, but per- fecting,' the thought might well be entertained that Hilarion had in mind the reconstruction of the Desyatinnaya, which after all Yaroslav had not allowed to decay, but had completed or restored to new perfection and splendor, and that the speaker then went on to mention St Sophia as the culmination of the con- structive work which Vladimir had initiated. Subjective interpretation of a rhetorical text is at best a risky pastime, and Hilarion's phrases do not weigh heavily in evidence against the Kievan chronicle as a source. The item in the Novgorod annals to which so much importance is attached may itself rise from a confusion between the Desyatinnaya and St Sophia in connection with the fire of 1017 and the rededication of the former church in 1039.2 There are other considerations which militate against the foundation of St Sophia in 1017. Yaroslav did not reenter Kiev after his first victory over Svyato- polk until after March 1 of that year. Boleslaw Chrobry of Poland concluded the 1 Ibid., p. 74; the clause 'ie ... sozda' ('he who has built') does not refer to Solomon, but is parallel with the two other ize clauses, 'he who is finishing . . . ,' 'he who has adorned . . . ,' all referring to Yaroslav. 2 Even A. A. Shakhmatov rejected the Novgorod item, though his explanation of its origin is considerably more complicated (Razyskanija o drevneigich letopisnych svodach [Spb., 1908], pp. 228- 230).</page><page sequence="16">492 Earliest Mediaeval Churches of Kiev peace of Bautzen with the Germans on January 30, 1018, perfected his arrange- ments for the invasion of Russia in support of Svyatopolk during the spring, defeated Yaroslav at the Bug on July 22, 1018, and entered Kiev on August 14. Since the mediaeval Russian calendar year prior to the fourteenth century began on March 1, the burning of the churches mentioned in the Russian annals took place between March 1, 1017, and March 1, 1018. Yaroslav was at Novgorod till 1018, and married Irene during that year before he recaptured Kiev. The year 1021 witnessed the raid on Novgorod by Bryachislav of Polotsk: the next year Yaroslav was campaigning in the northwestern marches about Brest- Litovsk. In 1024 he was obliged to defend his position in Kiev against his brother Mstislav, with whom a modus vivendi was concluded in 1026. The Russian princes intervened in the Polish disorders after the death of Mieszko ii in 1034, and it was not until after the death of Mstislav and Yaroslav's decisive defeat of the Pechenegs within the next two years that Yaroslav could regard his own position as secure and devote himself to his building program. On the whole, then, both the best sources and strong historical probabilities preclude the assumption that St Sophia was founded before 1037.1 It is a curious fact nevertheless that, apart from the erroneous item of 1039 in the Novgorod annals, the Russian chronicles make no mention of the dedica- tion of St Sophia. This omission is related, in the first place, to the length of time which the construction of the cathedral entailed in its various campaigns (see pp. 496-498 below), and also to the phases of the game of ecclesiastical politics played out between the princes of Kiev and the Byzantine hierarchy not only during the latter part of the reign of Yaroslav but also in the days of his sons. Though the Greek Theopemptos was named metropolitan in 1037, we have the highly exceptional appointment of the Russian Hilarion as metropolitan in 1051. Yet by 1055 mention is made of a third metropolitan named Ephrem, and some three years before this date, Yaroslav's son Vsevolod had married a daughter of Constantine Monomakh. In other words, if Hilarion's appointment signalized a momentary break with Byzantium, the marriage healed it, and upon the death of Yaroslav the Greek influence was once more dominant under the leadership of Ephrem, who took over the office after Hilarion's withdrawal or removal. Ephrem occupied the see until ca 1070, when he was replaced by an- other Greek metropolitan named George.2 The Gospels of Mstislav, an old Rus- sian manuscript copied in 1115-1117 for prince Mstislav of Novgorod, contain the note that St Sophia was consecrated by the metropolitan Ephrem on November 4. It may be assumed that the ceremony occurred on a Sunday which, between 1051 and 1072, fell on November 4 only in the years 1061 and 1067. On 1 Several of these factors (apart from the historical sequence) were effectively developed by N. P. Sychov, 'Drevneisi Fragment russko-vizantiskoi Zivopisi,' Seminarium Kondakovianum, ii (1928), 91-104, esp. p. 98 f., and while Ainalov, op. cit., p. 12, n. 1, accuses Sychov of 'irrige Auslegung einiger Nachrichten der Chroniken und anderer Quellen,' I am persuaded, as I have tried to show above, that the misinterpretation is the act, not of Sychov, but of his critic. 2 In this brief summary I have omitted source indications, which may be found in detail in Prisyolkov, op. cit., pp. 95-121.</page><page sequence="17">Earliest Mediaeval Churches of Kiev 493 one or the other of these dates, then, the consecration of St Sophia took place, though Yaroslav, its builder, had passed to his reward in 1054. Such is the historical background of the largest and best preserved among the mediaeval churches of Kiev, the architectural features of which are treated in the section following.' II BY KENNETH JOHN CONANT IN COLLABORATION WITH H. V. MORGILEVSKI (KIEV) AND S. H. CROSS As a matter of artistic geography it is quite easy to believe that Prince Vladi- mir's Desyatinnaya was a church of the provincial basilican type familiar, in the tenth century, at Kherson, in Bulgaria, and on the Holy Mountain. The building tradition of those regions, being adapted to provincial conditions, was easier to transplant northward than the metropolitan style of the Byzantine capital; moreover Vladimir as an innovator could be content with a provincial architec- ture. Granting that the Desyatinnaya was basilican, it is by no means easy to set up a descriptive formula which will allow for the peculiarities of the plan re- covered by Milyeyev and the historical texts which we have, leaving at the same time a certain latitude for hypothesis and possible errors in observation. Funda- mental in any proposed chronological system is the fact that there is but a single set of foundations, although the church suffered in the conflagration of 1017 (which would indicate a building with wooden roofing) yet is known, later, as a vaulted church. The natural assumption is that from the first it was built for vaulting, even though the execution may have been delayed. Three parallel barrel vaults over a nave with a short transept is a likely scheme, actually ex- emplified in the contemporary church of St Sophia at Ochrid. Whether such vaulting was ever built over the Desyatinnaya it is not possible to determine; but it is clear that the walls of the church required lateral stays before very long; their shallow foundations and the effects of winter on the soil are the obvious explanation. The irregular layout of the lateral elements of the Desyatinnaya (figure 1) shows that buttresses were added, and added piecemeal to the building, taking the form of a single wide gallery on each side, connected by a narrower narthex at the west. The new supports were spur walls applied 1 Of the other Kievan churches included in Yaroslav's building program only scanty remnants are extant. The Annunciation on the Golden Gate is represented by a fragment of walls and vaults in a small park at the corner of Sverdlov and Korolenko Sts. The column long attributed to St Irene's has been identified as actually belonging to this structure, which was also a five-naved church (cf. Otchety Imp. Arch. Ob., [1918], pp. 167-168). Its foundations largely lie under Korolenko St and existing buildings, so that further investigation is impossible except in case of extensive demolitions. The church of St George, dedicated in 1051, was the scene of the consecration of Hilarion as metro- politan (cf. Makari, 1st. Russk. Cerkvi, I, 64). Milyeyev's report on St George's (Trudy IV Sezda russkich architektov [Spb., 1911], pp. 117 if.) is not available to me. From the plan in Alpatov-Brunov (op. cit., p. 16), it would appear that both these churches had no arcades and were built with five domes. The presence of a staircase in St George's indicates that they were provided with galleries.</page><page sequence="18">494 Earliest Mediaeval Churches of Kiev opposite the piers of the church, cut through like flying buttresses, enclosed by arcading, and roofed in wood, if we may accept analogies from St Sophia in Kiev (figure 2). The exterior walls of this neighboring church began to tilt soon after they were built and were remedied by systematic interior flying buttresses; St Sophia also had a wooden-roofed narthex at first. Thus we have the definite possibility that the galleries of the Desyatinnaya burned in 1017, and that the 'new perfection' of the church as rebuilt by Yaro- slav's workmen consisted in fireproofing the galleries, and building a high vault in the Greek manner to replace what was faulty, provisional, or damaged in the roofing of the nave and aisles. This sequence satisfies the plan established by Milyeyev, as well as the historical texts; it gives a reasonable structural history for the building; it furnishes a background and preparation for the venerable cathedral of St Sophia, undertaken in 1037. It is more than probable that the masons were transferred by Yaroslav directly to St Sophia, leaving the Desya- tinnaya in the hands of decorators for two years prior to its dedication in 1039. In the great days of Yaroslav, Kiev was an important city, and its princes attempted to give it something of the grandeur and some of the airs of the Byzantine capital-St Sophia, St Irene, and the Golden Gate are obvious re- flections. The new church-type with several domes and integral exterior galleries is quite as convincing a proof of direct influence from Constantinople, for it is based on the Nea Ecclesia, built within the palace precincts by Emperor Basil i, and dedicated by Patriarch Photios on May 1, 881. Bold and novel in design, rich and colorful in decoration, associated with two notable historical characters, it became the type monument of the Second Golden Age. Far easier to emulate and much more in harmony with mediaeval ideas of proportion and composition than the peerless patriarchal cathedral of St Sophia, it was especially associated with the emperors, and so became the model for the finest princely churches of Slavic Christendom. The Nea has all but disappeared, yet careful investigation shows that it is fairly well represented, with variations, in the former church of St Theodosia (Gul-djami, the Mosque of the Rose, dated about 900).1 St Theodosia has been so much rebuilt that its original form is not easy to imagine, and while the sketch restoration accompanying this article (Plate i) is far from being a complete study, it will be of assistance in visualizing the design. Time has clearly shown that St Theodosia was too slenderly built, and we may fairly guess that this vice was inherited from the Nea. Like St. Theodosia, the Nea has a central dome and four minor domes arranged in a quincunx appearing above the eaves. It had in addition a gallery on each flank which brought the plan of the main body of the church nearly to a square. Even though certain details of the Nea remain vague, there is good reason to believe that its bold silhouette, its subsidiary chapels, and its exterior galleries were influenced by earlier works in the Caucasus. The ex- terior galleries were used as burial places in the Caucasus, according to Pro- fessor Morgilevski; this peculiarity, although it occurs in St Sophia in Kiev, is 1 For this church see A. van Millingen, Byzantine Churches in Constantinople (London, 1912), 164, also A.

St Sophia in Kiev represented not only the Nea Ecclesia destroyed in late Byzantine times, but also the old wooden cathedral of Novgorod built by Vladimir about 989 and burned in 1045. What the layout of the cathedral in Novgorod was, no one can say. It had thir- teen verkhi-roofs, gables, spires, pinnacles, or domes would answer the specifica- tion. The oldest existing wooden churches in Russia are six hundred years younger, and more, than the first cathedral of Novgorod, but one is tempted to imagine that it was a combination of square and octagonal forms with spires, somewhat like the elaborate late church of Ninoska, or a bundle of contiguous spire-like units, such as the church of Chodorov. The possibility of influence from Scan- dinavia or Germany is altogether uncertain. In any case the old cathedral of Novgorod was a striking design, and its thirteen verkhi - one for Christ, and one for each of the apostles, - obviously supplied the reason for the augmented cathedral plan at St Sophia in Kiev. Either Yaroslav enjoined a reminiscence of Novgorod or his architect, familiar with the Nea, found in the idea a legitimate means of expressing Russian ambitions and a way to surpass the Nea. During the summer of 1935 Professor Hippolyte Valentinovich Morgilevski, who had studied St Sophia attentively for twelve years and published or fur- nished the elements for interesting articles on it' was able to uncover special areas of the old masonry of St Sophia in Kiev while the building was being trans- formed into a museum. The present writer was kindly permitted to study the problem of the sequence of constructions at the cathedral, having the advantage of the friendly advice and help of Professor Morgilevski under the cordial aus- pices of the Society for Foreign Cultural Relations (VOKS), for whose cooper- ation Professor Cross and I are greatly indebted. After this work of investigation, no possible doubt remains that the whole middle group of domes was planned in the original design. The quincunx of the Nea served as the model for the nucleus, around which lay, on three sides, an integral two-story element supporting eight domes set at or near the corners, and adjacent to the angles of the quincunx. The original design also called for vaulted open galleries on the flanks of the church, with terraces above them. At the east end of the north gallery is a marble sarcophagus, placed there perhaps for Yaro- slav: figures 2, 3; plates ii, iII. Nothing of the original eaves line is now visible, 1 'Kiev et ses Environs,' MEm. de la Section histor, de l'Academie des Sciences d'Ukraine, xxii (1926), 81; Bulletin du Comite Archeoloqique d'Ukraine i (Kiev, 1930), 247.

At first the galleries were reached, in all probability, by a wooden stairway. Paintings on the face of the narthex wall give evidence of a former exonarthex (perhaps the first of many additions) which can only have been roofed in wood. Otherwise the lower part of the fabric was built of opus mixtum, a sort of coursed rubble resembling the classical wall-work of that name, but coarser in execution and larger in scale. The facing of the walls has lines of fairly large, somewhat rounded reddish liver-colored stones set in quantities of pink mortar which was marked with a cord to simulate an accurate edge around each stone, as if it were a cut stone. The courses are brought to a level by lines of thin orange-red brick: sometimes a single brick course, more often two courses widely separated by mortar. The mouldings are in the reddish stone with profiles like contempo- rary Byzantine work. According to Professor Morgilevski, opus mixtum was superseded in ordinary twelfth-century work by a type of masonry which occurs in certain parts of St Sophia - coursed brickwork with very wide mortar joints carried over the front of the alternate courses, which are set back to make this arrangement possible. Such a wall shows wide strips of pink mortar resembling stucco, but is marked by parallel lines of narrow brick. It is a familiar Byzantine construction; it occurs in fact at St Theodosia, Constantinople, in the tenth century. In portions of St Sophia, Kiev - domes, upper parts of apses, thin piers and walls - where the heavy opus mixtum might have been awkward, this brick construction was used instead. Among the earliest additions to St Sophia were the masonry stairway near the north-west corner and an enclosed gallery above each of the terraces. The end wall of the south gallery is still preserved, and is clearly an addition to the original work. The galleries were of rather fragile construction, and have left few other traces as a result of neglect and successive reconstructions, but suffi- cient remains were found by the present writer to support the reconstruction which is presented in Plate iv (alternate possibilities indicated in Plate vii). Part of three piers and an impost block are still in position, and the general ar- rangement of the vaulting was inferred from the necessities of construction and drainage. The typical bays were covered with pendentive domes, and resembled in a general way the porch gallery of the church of the Virgin and Forty Martyrs at Thessalonica (the former Kazandjilar-djami, dated 1028).1 The Kievan cathedral thus enlarged had gained in capacity, but it had lost its old silhouette inspired by the Nea in Constantinople. Now, by further additions, it was to regain its old line, and become the handsome pile which it remained through the modifications of the Lithuanian episode and down to the extrava- gant reconstruction of the eighteenth century (Plates v, vi). An open exterior gallery was added on each flank, and a new stair tower was constructed at the south-west corner of the building. The stair tower was necessary for communica- 1 For this church see Ch. Diehl, Monuments chretiens de Salonique (Paris, 1918), 153.</page><page sequence="31">498 Earliest Mediaeval Churches of Kiev tion; the open outer galleries were necessary to prevent serious structural dis- order in the main part of the building, where they arrested a threatening move- ment of the outer supporting piers, due to thrusting vaults and insufficient foun- dations. Professor Morgilevski has cleverly worked out the arrangement of the buttresses and their transverse barrel vaults (figure 2, note 1, p. 496). The baptistry of the cathedral dates from the period of this later construction, for it lies between the south tower and one of the stout interior flying buttresses. Considerable importance may be attached to the fact that the outer open gal- leries of St Sophia are constructed in opus mixtum, for this type of construction was abandoned in the twelfth century. The main lines and the detail of this work are hardly different from the oldest parts of the cathedral, and there is consequently good reason to believe that the whole series of additions (except perhaps the octagonal parts of the two towers) was made before the end of the eleventh century. Perhaps it took as much as a generation to complete the orig- ginal design. Possibly the augmentations took another generation - certainly no more. The church was built on a Byzantine theme, but it is not the work of Byzantine architects. The present writer first saw it after visiting and studying its proto- types in the Balkans, and was instantly aware of the difference in spirit. The stouter, blockier masonry, the simplifications and interpretations in detail, the curious combination of elaborate form and massive effect, the blending of ex- uberance and austerity - all speak volumes. The architect was evidently familiar at first or second hand with Russian, Caucasian, and Byzantine work, and here he created a true work of synthesis worthy to stand as the fountain head of a noble Russian school of church architecture. It will not escape the attentive ob- server that St Sophia in its second state presents the elements so beautifully developed by the school of Vladimir, which produced the loveliest of the Russian churches. The refinement of that school, its sureness of line and proportion, its unmistakably Russian character, call for some such mother monument as St Sophia in Kiev proves to have been. This important stylistic connection, as well as the beauty of St Sophia itself, give real significance to the archaeological work at Kiev. St Sophia is now open as a museum. In view of the diminishing congregation at this most venerable of Russia's old shrines, the government took over the building and it remained closed while the interior was partly cleaned, and the exterior walls investigated and covered with whitewash, except where it was appropriate to leave the original masonry exposed. A coat of green paint was applied to the tin roofing of the domes, covering the old blue with gilded stars, and some of the pinnacles were regilded. Thus freshened, the building was opened again, but various works of improvement continue in view of the striking position reserved for the museum as a near neighbor of the gigantic projected capitol buildings of the Ukrainian Republic, which will border a vast open plaza extending to the head of the bluff above the Dnieper. The most interesting work now in progress at St Sophia is the assembling of mosaics from St Michael's there, and the uncovering of the original frescoed decoration at the hand of</page><page sequence="32">Ruins of Tombs of Latin Kings on the Haram 499 Professor Yukin of Moscow. Although the multitude of saintly figures and the dynastic portraits have suffered from time, exposure, and repainting, they are of remarkable interest and beauty, and worthily take their places beside the gorgeous old mosaics. In the end the interior will appear much as it did in the twelfth century. No attempt will be made to restore the exterior to its old con- dition: to gain an idea of its old appearance it will be necessary to have resort to reconstruction drawings like the studies which are presented here.
