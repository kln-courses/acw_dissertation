Chicago: The University of Chi- cago Press, 1969. The publication of the Critique de la raison dialectique in 1960 produced a decade of anti-exis- tentialist obituaries. Both recently converted struc- turalists and traditionally hostile Anglo-American critics considered the book verbose and ultimately disappointing. Existentialism was finished; long live L6vi-Strauss! Even the chapters from the work-in- progress on Flaubert did little to ease the sting from Steven R. Ungar is a Graduate Student in Romance Studies at Cornell University and an Editor of Diacritics. Steven R. Ungar detractors who wondered (with Jean-Pierre Faye) "Does Sartre understand Sartre?" Amid this apocalyptic rhetoric, the Sartrian critic has taken on the added burden of dealing with what amounts to a ritual burial of Sartre by those who would forcibly retire a reluctant master. As the span of Sartre's work encompasses forty years, each successive generation of readers faces an ever- growing body of texts whose understanding requires investigation of even earliest works. An evolutionary overview of the writings is necessary also when re- lating Sartre's works to their intellectual and social backgrounds. Benjamin Suhl states in his opening remarks that his Philosopher as Literary Critic is to date the only survey and appraisal of Sartre's literary criticism in any language (p. vii). The validity of his claim is secondary to the fact that his book has the flaws and virtues of an exploratory work. While Suhl does succeed in introducing his reader to Sartre's crit- icism, tentative introductions have been previously offered by Murdoch, Champigny, Jameson, Kaelin,</page><page sequence="2">33 Thody, and Manser.1 Suhl is the first to devote an entire study to the subject, but his scant references to these other critics indicate that his own study is more exploratory than it ought to be. Despite an intention to "render explicit Sartre's literary criticism from the vantage point of his phi- losophy" (p. 8), Suhl fails to resolve certain impor- tant philosophical problems. In his study of Sartre's early reviews, he notes the impossibility of discuss- ing the articles without reference to Sartre's concur- rent fiction and phenomenological studies. But hav- ing thus argued, he is unwilling to resolve the philo- sophical themes and problems of which the reviews are themselves demonstrations. Topics such as Hus- serlian "reduction" and Sartre's concept of imagina- tion are mentioned, but only as footnotes or with passing attention. Husserl is often quoted at length without interpretative comment. Even when Suhl notes correctly the relation of phenomenological method to Sartre's interest in hu- man consciousness (pp. 10-14), his analysis only skims the surface. Sartre, he writes, wants to " 'touch' reality" (p. 11), and yet Suhl fails to dem- onstrate the relation of that desire to Sartre's com- mitment to literary expression, and specifically what Husserlian phenomenology offers as a methodolog- ical base. While Suhl points out that Husserl's sys- tem involves a radical turning away from the "nat- ural world" (p. 3), he fails to emphasize the impact of this turning away on Sartre's critical method. When he acknowledges that Sartre adopted early Husserlian "reduction" and description as his own, Suhl substantiates his contention only with quotes from Husserl's Ideas and pays little attention to Sartre's deviation from Husserl in The Transcen- dence of the Ego. Husserl's most explicit description of the "nat- ural standpoint" and epoche ("abstention" or "re- duction") appears in Chapter Three of Ideas (Ed- mund Husserl, Ideas; General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology, trans. W. R. Boyce Gibson, Lon- don: Collier-MacMillan Ltd., 1962). It should be noted before presenting Husserl's argument that Sartre's later rejection of the epoche does not con- stitute a complete denial of Husserl's method. The argument in The Transcendence of the Ego is found- ed on ideological differences which led Sartre away from the scientific systematics towards which Hus- serl was working. "Bracketing" is inherent in any critical attitude and is not restricted to the phe- nomenologist's vocabulary. Husserl postulates a world endlessly spread out in space. Through sight, touch, hearing, etc., experi- ence of corporeal objects as present "for me" is pos- sible, whether or not these objects are given any spe- cial attention. Knowledge of the world at this stage is not a product of conceptual thinking: it is an awareness of a vast spatial and temporal horizon within the field of experience, a dimly apprehended depth or fringe of indeterminate reality. Continually present "for me," the world is not only an arena of facts and objects, but also one of judgments. It is a world where objects and living things have no in- herent qualities except name and function. While vagueness characterizes the world, "my" experience of men is not quite the same as "my" ex- perience of doormats. In experiencing other men, I understand them as Ego-Subjects, entities like myself, related to their individual surroundings. Despite dif- ferences in the perception, memory, and experience of others, we arrive at certain mutual agreements and set up a system of convenience-the objective fact- world, "our world," which we claim to know with certainty and to which we all belong. Doubts and rejection of data in this fact-world preserve intact the basic faith in its presence "for us," Husserl's "general thesis of the natural standpoint." The world as fact- world is continually present and it is the goal of the sciences of the "natural standpoint" to know that world more comprehensively than does the naive lore of experience. Husserl next proposes a radical alteration of the general thesis which would ideally lead to the discovery of new domains of scientific knowledge through a methodical doubting of every awareness judged as "present" or "real" from the "natural standpoint." This attempt at doubting is effected through a temporary suspension (or "disconnection") of the "natural standpoint," Husserl making the point that a permanent suspension would be unat- tainable and useless. Suspension is not a denial of the fact-world: we do not abandon the general thesis adopted, no change alters our conviction. As no new criteria of judgment are introduced (the essence of the epoche is an attempt to find the most compre- hensive criteria of judgment) the original thesis is preserved. But though preserved, it is modified. Through the epoche the general thesis is set "out of action;" it is "disconnected," "bracketed." We pre- serve it but make no use of it. In the "reduced" state, consciousness undergoes what Husserl calls a trans- valuation, an alteration which engages man's full freedom by attempting to oppose cognitive attitudes under the original thesis. Once "put out of action," it becomes "bracketed" and formerly simple judgments become "bracketed" judgments. As adapted by Sartre, Husserl's method be- comes primarily a way of grasping the world and articulating experience. Husserl's epoche is an at- tempt to suspend the epistemic commitments which tacitly support individual claims about daily events. By suspending the veridical character of common ex- perience, the phenomenologist attempts to shift at- tention so as to alter our prior apprehension of things and acts. The break from "natural" attitudes seeks to transform immersion in the objects of awareness into a reflexive concern for the nature of conscious- ness. Rather than seeing, touching, or hearing ob- jects, critical focus is turned to the phenomena of seeing, touching, and hearing objects. 1Iris Murdoch.

In Nausea Sartre deduces, in fact, a philo- sophical consequence from the contemplation of a glass of beer. Despite its jargon and the ambiguities of transcendental idealism, Husserl's phenomenology tried to return to things themselves. By suspending the "natural standpoint" which men adopt from habit and convenience, Husserl hoped to reawaken in them a fascination with the world. By learning to see the ordinary fact-world solely as experience, Sartre found in Husserl a means of returning existential value to the philosophical activity of describing life, by plac- ing human consciousness in the foreground of his investigations. Sartre applied the disconnection from the "natural standpoint" to his experience of aesthetic objects also. As a product of the imagination, the art object brings to the forefront of the reader's (or on- looker's) experience a content detached from its physical characteristics. The novel (or painting) is then not a verbal (or linear) microcosm reflecting the world (there is no longer a single fact-world for everyone), but rather an unveiling to the reader (on- looker) of the experiential foundation of an aesthetic world grasped in the apprehension of an artifact. Sartre's theories on reading and the function of lit- erature are more systematically presented in What is Literature? (1947), but the substance of those later views is present in the studies written between 1936 and 1940. The immanent weakness of Suhl's study can be traced to its hybrid nature. His basic hypothesis is valid. He notes rightly that in his literary criticism, Sartre has set forth judgments on the uses and mis- uses of language which reflect his attitudes toward literary expression in any form. However, to main- tain that a close examination of Sartre's literary crit- icism will show it to be a mediation between his phenomenology and the experiential world of his au- thor is plausible, if elementary. To attempt both an exposition and an analysis of Sartre's literary crit- icism from the early reviews to the Flaubert is her- culean. It appears to have been too demanding for Suhl. His book is both survey and appraisal-a sepa- ration questionable in itself. Had he chosen one or the other, his analysis would have been more co- herent. His reluctance to decide is likely to leave his readers, neophytes and specialists, unsatisfied. George H. Bauer's Sartre and the Artist is more original and informative than Suhl, although at first glance the studies appear similar. Both set out as presentations of Sartre's work through the crit- ical perspectives of artistic activity: those of literary critic and artist. Yet Bauer limits his subject matter so as to isolate Sartre's aesthetic theme. He makes no claim to comprehensiveness, restricting his atten- tion to Sartre's own preoccupation with artifacts, the artist, and the creative act. Bauer separates the fic- tion and the art criticism, his treatment being most adequately demonstrated in the latter. He divides them according to mode-sculpture, painting, poetry, and closes with an appendix on music. Bauer's study of Nausea, "Melancholy of the Artist," is particularly original. He begins by relat- ing the original title Melancholia to traditional ex- pressions of boredom, spleen, and ennui (in Nerval, Michelet, and Gautier) the model of which he sees in the Diirer engraving, Melancolia I. He considers it to be the novel's conscious or unconscious thematic origin. Panofsky's study of the engraving allows Bauer to argue that the last-minute change of title by Sartre's publisher hides the artistic pre- occupations of Nausea behind a philosophic veil. If we accept Roquentin's contention that nothing hap- pens while one is living, Nausea becomes the record of his failure to order the moments of his existence like those of a life remembered-an adventure. In another sense Nausea traces Roquentin's attempt to articulate the events which led to his diary. Bauer believes that the problem of articulating and evaluat- ing experience through artistic creation is central to the book's philosophical and novelistic structure. Bauer's study of Nausea is itself framed around two incidents which mark the novel's begin- ning and end. Not surprisingly, these episodes re- volve around aesthetic experiences. The crisis in Ro- quentin's life antedates the pebble incident at the book's start. His decision to return to France from the Orient has its source in the apprehension of an object which has in itself a two-fold being, a Khmer statuette, the sight of which causes Roquentin to feel as though filled with lymph or lukewarm milk. After sensing the statuette's dual nature (stone ma- terial and art object) Roquentin is left with a feel- ing of emptiness followed by growing discomfort. Roquentin, as will be seen, would be a sculpture, if this were possible, but his initial reaction is withdrawal from what he thought was a life of adventure and a return to a project which would be his creative life. The problem posed for him by the statue precipitates his return to work on a biography of M. de Rollebon (p. 19). The confronting of the statuette, in which free- dom suddenly stirs convulsively, is not immediately understood by Roquentin. At the novel's end, after abandoning Rollebon's biography and preparing to leave Bouville, he is capable of articulating his shame on hearing the jazz melody. Bauer traces the condemnation of artistic institutions throughout the novel. The official museum portraits, St. Cecilia-of- the Sea, the statue of Imp6traz, all are rejected as showpieces of the social establishment; they mean nothing to Roquentin. Only the jazz melody remains, the pure acidulated saxaphone sounds which have "saved" composer and singer by retrospectively ob- jectifying their suffering through the creative act. In La Nausde the reader follows the progressive refusal of being in stone and the temptation of imaginary being of the art object as Sartre has represented it in his philo- sophical study, L'Imaginaire [...]. Roquentin becomes aware that the nausea of the experience of life in the flesh cannot be overcome in the present by any artistic project. The writer or artist can only achieve being in connection with his own legend or myth as it becomes a part of the past (p. 43). Bauer's study allows understanding of the novel as a search for self-justification through various artistic projects confronted and rejected. Panofsky's interpretation of Diirer provides Bauer with a valid icon as point of departure, although Bauer's perspec- tive appears to be that of an art historian rather than that of a literary critic. His dual interests as teacher of literature and art historian give him a breadth miss-</page><page sequence="4">35 ing in more restricted critics even though this same diversity seems occasionally to relegate literary prob- lems to a secondary level. A passage from the discussion of Sartre's essay on Giacometti illuminates Bauer's sensitivity to the sculptor and his understanding of Sartre's sense of artistic creation in a non-literary medium: Sartre sees the source of Giacometti's stylization in painting. The imaginary space of a painting is created in sculpture by compressing the space that surrounds the figure by the stylistic device of elongation and by frag- menting the surface of the plaster. This results in the fabrication of a figure that gives up the detail of the body retained by classical sculpture. Parts of the anat- omy of the figure remain obscured and thus permit a unity of expression which cannot be fragmented by closer observation. The resulting distance from the figure creates an experience of a whole person viewed from the outside (p. 108). What Sartre calls the "indecomposable presence" of Giacometti's sculpture becomes the "indissoluble unity" of the human face in his portraits. Bauer traces Sartre's obsessive interest in human portraits in Nausea, The Psychology of the Imagination, and two little-known works, Portraits officiels and Vi- sages, originally published in 1939 and reprinted to- gether in 1948 under the title Visages. Both texts can be found in Contat's and Rybalka's encyclopedic Les Ecrits de Sartre (Paris: Gallimard, 1970). Bauer links Sartre's concern with the human face to his critical tendency to mythologize artists and artistic projects to suit his philosophical ideas. From the masks created for the original production of The Flies to the Medusa-like "look of the Other" in Being and Nothingness, Sartre has used the face as an icon representing the human condition. Sartre thus describes the expressive paintings of Andre Masson as repudiations of a stereotyped concept of man, as epitomized in official portraiture. The choice of Masson's work is an interesting one. A long-time friend of Sartre, Masson's experiments with flowing line portraits stimulated Sartre's interest in new mythologies arising through the creative process. Yet Sartre, Bauer notes, alters his material by choosing only those works that permit him to see Masson as a partisan of his own ideas; the paintings to which Sartre refers are almost exclusively anthropomorphic in character. This tendency appears also in Sartre's refusal to call Masson's work surrealist. Instead of acknowledging patently surrealist themes (dream, ambiguity, expansion, eroticism) Sartre constructs a parallel interpretation in his personal idiom. The quality of movement, Sartre himself claims, in erotic acts, brings forth not finitude, but explosion, not inertia heaped on a being that is what it is and noth- ing else, but a certain manner of being all that it isn't and never being exactly what it is (pp. 140-41). Delimitation of subject matter to substantiate critical views eventually characterizes Sartre's entire method. Bauer's study of Sartre's poetic criticism em- phasizes the subordination of verbal creativity to a fundamental search for being on the part of the poet; desire for a fixed being moves Sartre to condemn the poetry of Baudelaire, Mallarmb, Ponge, and Genet. Only in the black poets of (the former) French Africa did Sartre find poetic creation in accordance with his philosophical requirements, as an expres- sion of existence. In the black poet's preference for vegetal and organic images, Sartre perceives a de- veloping language now rising up against the fixed (mineral) vernacular of French colonialists. Black African French inverts the colonialists' linguistic practices into a vehicle of black liberation. By dis- rupting the language of racial exploitation, black French poetry embodies the open-ended project of human existence and the correct ideological aesthetics Sartre finds absent in other verse. Sartre is often criticized for his antipathy to- wards poetry. For Bauer, Sartre has reversed Mal- larme's contention that one does not make poetry with ideas, but with words. But is this really so? Sartre's attitudes toward poetry are often ambivalent, but Bauer would have been on safer ground had he stressed the metaphorical irony of black French poetry as represented by Sartre: The Negro learns to say "white as snow" for innocent, to talk about black looks, black deeds. No sooner does he open his mouth than he is accusing himself-unless he strives to reverse the scheme of values. And if he does this in French, he is already writing poetry: imagine the strange flavor for us of such phrases as the "black- ness of innocence" or "the shadows of virtue?" Bauer may have chosen to end his book with a study of Sartre's poetic criticism because poetry is the least ideational of the modes considered. But poetry is also closest to the verbal medium in which Sartre expresses his ideas. In studying Sartre's essays on poetry, Bauer does not adequately distinguish the nature of poetry from other forms of artistic expres- sion. Sartre's poetic criticism differs from his other criticism because it is expressed in a medium similar to its object. Literary criticism speaks the language of its object: it is meta-language, "discourse on a discourse" (Roland Barthes, Essais critiques, Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1964, p. 255). Bauer is best in posing the difficulties of artis- tic creation as they appear in Sartre's works and in his understanding of the works of others. He iso- lates both the peculiar problems facing the artist in his chosen medium and Sartre's evaluation of the artist's success or failure to resolve those problems. Bauer is usually careful to present faithfully the ma- terial as it appears both in Sartre's essays and in the works themselves. The insights into artistic themes that run through Sartre's works help to make up for the occasional irresolution of literary problems. Suhl cites an early statement by Sartre on the function of the critic: "to take a stand for or against and to situate himself by situating" (p. 45, from "Aller et retour"). In Suhl's argument, Sartre's lit- erary criticism mediates between his philosophy and literature. At best this conclusion is partial: it does not take account of criticism as a lived act. Sartre's criticism is a more complex mediation between the Other (as creator) and Sartre (as reader), and Sartre (as creator) and the Other (as reader). De- spite Suhl's concluding argument on "The Validity of Literature," he does not satisfactorily characterize the activity of the critic as a coming-to-girips with the Other. Although centered on the term "mediation," the weakness of Suhl's conclusion is more than a question of vocabulary or connotation, since it im- plies a spatial relation ("mediation" in the physical sense) where mediation is primarily to mean recon- diacritics/Fall 1971</page><page sequence="5">36 ciliation or communication. Suhl's argument implies a categorical differentiation between Sartre's philos- ophy, literature, and literary criticism, which destroys the unity of the works. Since he opens his introduc- tion with "It has been said that literature is latent existentialism" (p. 3), he is himself evidently un- certain about the validity of this separation. Suhl's ambiguity is not merely verbal. It reflects his failure to come to a basic understanding of Sartre's literary criticism as an activity with special significance, as an act of confrontation between Sartre and the Other. A fictional technique always relates back to the novelist's metaphysics. The critic's task is to define the latter be- fore evaluating the former. Now it is obvious that Faulk- ner's metaphysics is a metaphysics of time. (Jean-Paul Sartre, Literary Essays, trans. B. Frechtman. New York: Philosophical Library, 1957; p. 79). Suhl quotes this passage from Sartre's essay on The Sound and the Fury in arguing that Sartre's critical method takes an author's style as its point of departure (p. 46). At another point, Suhl notes that Sartre's criticism attempts to grasp an author's metaphysics (p. 268). The style-to-metaphysics con- nection is potentially enlightening, but Suhl only touches on the problem. At the very least, Sartre is making a statement on the activity of reading which requires further recognition. If we accept the act of reading (in the above example) as an entry into Faulkner's world, this entry requires a change in the reader's awareness. In his essay on John Dos Passos' 1919, Sartre describes reading as a jump into the mirror held up by the novel. Jumping into the novel is, simultaneously, a jumping away from daily-consciousness-of-the-world, Husserl's "natural standpoint," in favor of a fictional standpoint. As with Husserl's epoche, the world of the "natural standpoint" is not denied; it continues to exist. If reading is a jumping into the mirror of the imaginary, it is nonetheless true that the mirror- book exists in the "real" fact-world.2 As soon as we begin to look at any episode, it opens up to reveal behind it other episodes, all the other episodes. Nothing happens; the story does not unfold. We discover it under each word, like an obscene and obstructing presence, more or less condensed, depending on the particular case (Literary Essays, p. 79). In this passage, which directly precedes the one quoted by Suhl, Sartre describes the progressive revelation of a story which does not happen. The story (plot, tale) is hidden beyond words, beyond episodes. The stylistic ambiguities of The Sound and the Fury are thus not simple irregularities of Faulk- ner's pen: they are the signs of his metaphysics. Even if valid, Suhl's characterization certainly under- values the cognitive elements of reading. Suhl wants to claim that critical reading means grasping an author's metaphysics, but he does not show that metaphysics comes to be known by the reader. Sartre's use of the term "metaphysics" is itself un- clear. When he writes that Faulkner's metaphysics is one of time, the term cannot be taken in any larger systematic sense. As used here, "metaphysics" is given a dynamic connotation--those factors which make the work cohere or collapse. In What is Litera- ture? Sartre describes metaphysics as a living effort to embrace from within the human condition as a whole. In the Critique he connects a writer's style to his "world-view." If, as Sartre contends, Faulk- ner's metaphysics is temporal, then reading is still the necessary condition for experiencing that textual world-view from within. The metaphysics is not "in the text"; the story is not the sum of its episodes. It is revealed through the episodes, by means of the stylistic devices which form and limit the reader's experience of the fictional world-view apprehended through reading. The critic's task is not to under- stand the story (Sartre emphasizes that nothing is happening) but rather to understand how The Sound and the Fury becomes a structured entity for the reader. Sartre implies that whatever is happening in the novel happens in its language. Critical focus should then be on the author's style, which is the means of conveying the textual world-view from author to reader. Reading involves a temporary modification of consciousness in order to allow understanding of a fictional consciousness. A text can have meaning for the reader only when he interprets the fictional world-view in terms of previous experience. The modification of consciousness turns reading into a critical and reflexive act which illuminates the read- ing consciousness to itself by cutting it off from prac- tical contexts. What is most often taken for granted in the fact-world, (those epistemic assumptions which tacitly hold the fact-world together) is made explicit through the temporary inhibition of free consciousness. When the text is put down (when the reader jumps back out of the mirror) consciousness is altered, either strengthened in former convictions or opened to new ones. The way the reader grasps Faulkner's metaphysics affects the way future world- views will be grasped on both sides of the mirror. Critical reading involves questions of cognitive sig- nificance, questions dealt with as they pose them- selves. Style is intrinsic to the epistemological nature of the reading of literature. If The Sound and the Fury were merely the demonstration of a previously determined metaphysics, nothing could be gained from reading the novel. It is Frederic Jameson who has best under- stood the importance of style in the critical act of reading: Yet just as the reading of a novel is simply a very highly developed type of relationship between two people, so this center that it seems we ought to be able to locate and eventually fix turns out to be nothing more than a human being. The book, looked back at from this view- point, turns out to be simply an act among other kinds of acts in the development of a human life, and the purely literary style begins to lose its privileged status and be confounded with the style of a life, gestures among other gestures, and in this new framework yield- ing the same kind of meaning as the other more daily gestures (Sartre: The Origins of a Style, p. ix). The problems raised in Sartre's more system- atic studies and in his fiction are not essentially dif- ferent from those raised in his criticism. All are dif- 2Many critics have disagreed with Sartre's concept of the work of art as imaginary (see The Psychology of the Imagination). The art work, as an imaginary object pro- duced outside the world by a consciousness in the world, is the source of acquiring new knowledge through po- tential negation of former beliefs. As used by Sartre, "imaginary" and "real" are not mutually exclusive. The imaginary (unreal) is always constituted on the founda- tion of the world which it denies and thus modifies.</page><page sequence="6">31 ferent forms of the Sartrian attempt to understand human experience. Knowledge is slow to come by; it is reached through the synthesis of an infinite series of attempts to understand so many world- views experienced and assimilated throughout a life- time. The critical essays mark moments of that ideal synthesis which remains by definition incomplete and open to the future. What makes Sartre so interesting to follow is that his self-proclaimed mission as de- mystifier has ultimately converted his own writings into a Sartrian myth. Sartre's essays, themselves lit- erary reflections, are the basis of the studies by Suhl and Bauer, which are in turn the basis of this essay that is either three times removed from the reality of the primary texts or three times closer to it, through critical filtration. Like Roquentin's effort at self- understanding, Sartre's attempt to comprehend the world through verbal reflection cannot be definitively vindicated. There are only words and demonstra- tions, more words and future demonstrations. In theory and in practice, words have never been ends for Sartre. They have been signs of human acts, and Sartre's apparent inconsistencies in linguis- tic theory can be traced to the ever-changing sig- nificance of human acts. Sartre's early linguistic sensitivity, similar to Mallarme's and Valery's, ap- pears in the later fiction and criticism, the early problems of language having evolved into problems of communication. The urgency and frustration of interpersonal communication experienced during the German occupation has had a lifelong effect on Sartre's writings. The readership of Les Temps Mo- dernes is not that of the prewar Nouvelle Revue Frangaise. Sartre has tried to write for the masses. As Being and Nothingness came to carry the weight of his reputation, Sartre was placed in the unwanted role of spokesman. For remote reasons, crit- ics often considered Sartre's fiction and criticism diluted philosophizing which neglected literary prob- lems but wallowed in ideological flimflam. The ap- pearance of The Words was greeted with moans of academic relief for precisely the wrong reasons, a general belief that Sartre had at last returned to lit- erature. He had completed an ideological round-trip and was coming back a humanist! Relief was short- lived. Words alone have never been sufficient to contain Sartre's curiosity. When the early literary problems were pushed aside by the war, Sartre could no longer look back at them in the same way. Hav- ing survived the war, he trusted his journalistic ca- reer to the ginerosite he had come to know. His commitments to communication warned him against the self-enchantment which he condemned in Baude- laire and Valery. If he has occasionally betrayed the same temptation to linguistic self-absorption which he has attacked in others, his commitment has re- mained firm; his perseverance has vindicated his faith in words. For a long time I took my pen for a sword; I now know we're powerless. No matter, I write and will keep writ- ing books; they're needed; all the same, they do serve some purpose. Culture doesn't save anything or anyone, it doesn't justify. But it's a product of man; he projects himself into it, he recognizes himself in it; that critical mirror alone offers him his image (The Words. trans. B. Frechtman, New York: G. Braziller, 1964, pp. 254-55).</page></plain_text>
