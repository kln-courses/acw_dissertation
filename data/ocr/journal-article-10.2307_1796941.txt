<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ROLE OF INDIA IN THE DIFFUSION OF EARLY CULTURES WILLIAM KIRK During the last three decades considerable archaeological evidence has been produced for prehistoric and early historic India which demands the attention of historical geographers?particularly those interested in problems of long- term cultural diffusion. In this paper three episodes in the cultural history of south Asia are examined from a geographical point of view, viz (A) The eastward diffusion of Indus valley urban cultures c.1500 bc (B) The diffusion of Early Iron Age cultures in the first millennium bc (C) The expansion of Gangetic civilization after c.500 bc In each episode the importance of the forest frontier is noted and the function of two corridors of diffusion (the Gangetic corridor and the Deccan corridor) examined. Indian civilization is seen as a product of the interplay of desert and forest environments and south Asia as a notable area for the transformation of cultural complexes by trans-regional adaptations. 'Did all that the Harappans represented perish with them? . . . It may be that the continuity which now seems to have characterized the Saurashtrian extension of the civilization and its succession contains the explanation. Otherwise we are left with the paradox that the Indus civilization transmitted to its successors a metaphysics that endured, while it failed utterly to transmit, at any rate from its primary homeland, the physical civilization which is its present monument'. Sir Mortimer Wheeler (1968, p. 137) During the 25 years of Indian independence considerable advances have been made in establishing a chronological framework for the early cultures of the sub-continent and in elucidating connections between cultural systems that formerly appeared to be totally unrelated. Thanks to the fieldwork and exca- vations carried out by the officers of the Archaeological Survey of India, Lal, Gosh, Sankalia and others, and the systematization of findings and research by British scholars such as Wheeler, Piggott, Gordon, and Bridget and Raymond Allchin, many of the problems of Indian prehistory that looked so intractable a quarter of a century ago appear less so now, or at least have been more precisely defined in space-time contexts.1 The Indus civilization, once splendid in its isola? tion, 'without genesis or decay', is now seen to have occupied a much wider area than the Indus riverain and to have had strong cultural connections to the west at the time of its birth and powerful eastward influences during its decline. The Gangetic civilization that succeeded it in the first millennium bc is similarly not now regarded as something imported into India solely in the chariots of Aryan invaders, while careful definition of pottery sequences on intermediate sites has *For general archaeological background see e.g. Piggott, S. 1950 Prehistoric India; Wheeler, M. 1959 Early India and Pakistan; Gordon, D.

Chronological gaps still remain in the settlement and cultural history of south Asia, but they have tended to become narrower so that it is now no longer necessary to insert cartographical 'elephants for want of towns'. There is still some spatial imbalance in the work of the archaeologists but the westering tendency is no longer as strong as when the Indus valley itself lay within the provenance of the Archaeological Survey of India. By concentrating on strati? graphy and the time dimension of sites there has necessarily been some neglect of the areal arrangements and morphology of settlements; but sufficient information has been obtained in places to support the indications of literary sources, while excavation accounts have become increasingly concerned with the economic func? tions of places. In short, advances in archaeological and historical knowledge of the prehistoric and early historical chronology and spatial reach of the early cultures of south Asia have now reached a stage at which the historical geographer can find much of interest to his own discipline and perhaps can begin to make a contribution to the solution of those problems concerning the influence of contrasting environ? ments on the diffusion of cultures and the spatial behaviour of various communities of culture bearers. In this paper three episodes in the cultural history of south Asia are examined from a geographical point of view: (A) The eastward carry of materials, tech? nology and ideas derived from the Indus civilization during the later stages of its existence (i.e. c.1500 bc). (B) The diffusion of Early Iron Age cultures in south Asia in the first millennium bc. (C) The expansion of Gangetic civilization after ?.500 bc. In each case one is concerned not so much with cultural complexes in their entirety as with those elements that act as indicators of the leading margins of innovation waves and one seeks to determine the directions in which the tide flows most strongly. In so doing one must be aware of certain characteristics of long-term diffusion processes such as those being considered here. That, for example, obstacles to diffusion do not remain fixed in time but vary in efficacy according to the kind of pressures that are exerted upon them and in the light of the changing technology and perceptions of human communities. Unlike the assumed constancy of the function of obstacles in models of short-period diffusion processes, over longer periods the barriers of one generation may become the corridors of movement of the next. Similarly in longer term processes one must be aware of the phenomenon of cultural transformation whereby elements are transformed in the course of diffusion by adaptation to local physical and cultural environments through which they are passing. In such cases the end product may appear to be very different from the element at the outset of its journey and problems of identification are encountered before spatial linkages can be established. Frequently also innovation waves are characterized by irregular, jerky, forward movements. For long periods the limits of diffusion appear to be static, lacking the power of further penetration, and then?as though the system had been re-energized?there occurs a sudden leap forward to new frontiers. As will be seen, south Asia offers many illustrations of such features of diffusion theory. Episode A The Indus civilization (or Harappan culture) (Fig. 1) represents the earliest known development of large-scale urbanization in the Indian sub-continent and in so far as no immediate successor-civilization can be recognized the episode on the whole has been judged abortive?a glorious but false dawn of Indian urbanism,</page><page sequence="3">THE ROLE OF INDIA IN THE DIFFUSION OF EARLY CULTURES 21 It is true that several authors have drawn attention to the similarity between various cults and cult objects?such as Shiva figures?from the Indus and the constituents of historic Brahmanism as it arose a thousand years later in the Gangetic lowlands, but there appears to have been little transmission eastward of the material fabric of urban life. Nevertheless the picture of such an advanced civilization, known to have dominated the Indus valley for a thousand years from sophisticated cities such as Mohenjo Daro and Harappa, coming to an abrupt end (in the words of Wheeler 'as it were at four o'clock on a Wednesday afternoon'), without a trace in areas around it or without an impact on the following period, was too untrue to life to survive for long. Indeed the very event of Indian independence, by cutting off the Archaeological Survey of India from its former sites in the Indus basin and fostering work in the western terrains of the new India, was instrumental in re- vealing an eastward extension of Harappan culture that had hitherto been unsus- pected. Excavations which began in 1953 at Rangpur and were continued at Lothal, Sojanipur, Bhagatrava and other sites have demonstrated the presence of Harappan culture bearers in the area of the Gulf of Cambay from 2500 bc onwards (Rao, 1963). At Lothal, for example, five structural phases have been recognized in some 6-5 m of habitation deposits?each separated by materials indicative of flooding. In Phase 1 the site was occupied by a small village of mud-brick houses protected against the floods of the Sabarmati by a peripheral mud wall. Its harbour served a hinterland growing cotton, wheat and rice and the village did some trade in ivory and locally manufactured beads. The red, grey, and black and red, pottery characteristic of this phase is quite distinct from the Harappan, but about 2450 bc Harappan sea farers arrived at the site and in the following period Harappan pottery, metal and stone equipment are mixed with native materials. Following a destructive flood the settlement was completely rebuilt according to the Harappan model with a citadel and lower town, massive brick platforms, peripheral walls, and well laid out building blocks all with the same attention to town-drainage and sanitation as characterizes the Indus cities. Associated with the town was a sizeable dock, 247 m by 37 m, enclosed by walls of kiln-fired bricks and accessible at high tide by ships from the Gulf of Cambay, and it is clear that during Phases 2, 3 and 4 when the town achieved full Harappan culture the sea-trade of Lothal reached considerable proportions. There are indications of trade with Bahrain and other entrepot ports of the Persian Gulf and trading contacts with the Narmada valley from which semi-precious stones (agate, opal, etc) were imported for bead making.2 The craft workshops of the lower town produced large quantities of beads for export, including micro-beads of gold and steatite, fine bronze instruments, such as drills and needles, and ivory objects of a high quality. In such work there is no slavish copying of Indus valley art forms, however. The depiction of natural scenes of deer and birds on their painted pottery and the casting and engraving of metal figures of birds, dogs, rams and human beings attest the continuance and development of strong local traditions in the face of Harappan acculturation. By 2000 bc, however, there are signs that the earlier prosperity of Lothal was waning. A destructive flood about that time was not followed by customary rebuild- ing and C 14 dating of material from a breach in one of the arms of the dockyard See e.g. Bibby, T.

Some of its people appear to have moved to Rangpur, 48 km to the south-west, where a pre-pottery micro- lithic culture is superseded by Late (mature) Harappan culture 2000-1500 bc, and it is possible that at about the same time a Harappan colony was established at Bhagatrav, near modern Surat. Further extensive flooding, however, seems to have occurred about 1500 bc with widespread destruction of Harappan settlements in Gujarat, as indeed in the Indus valley, and at Rangpur there is some evidence of refugee settlements maintaining an attenuated form of Harappan culture in the following centuries until the establishment of a definitely post-Harappan culture characterized by Lustrous Red Ware ?.1000 bc Elsewhere there seem to have been population movements inland to higher, safer, but not so commercially productive sites, such as Sojanipur, on the margins of the Thar desert and possibly over the watershed into the Banas river valley and the ancient basins of the Aravalli uplands. The expansion of Harappan culture eastward to the Gulf of Cambay and the lower Narmada river is thus now well attested and a degenerative form of the cul? ture appears to have survived in the area for some four centuries after the date formerly thought to mark the end of the Harappan era (Allchin and Joshi, 1970). Similarly in the north there are now clear indications of eastward extension of the culture into the Indo-Gangetic divide area and the upper Gangetic plains (Dikshit, 1967; 1970). Field surveys in 1950-53 discovered some 30 Harappan sites located along the dried-up courses of the ancient Sarasvati (Ghaggar) and Drishadvati rivers, of which Kalibangan seems to have been the largest settlement.3 Excavations at Rupar on the Sutlej suggest a strong north-eastward movement of the Harappan frontier at the height of its cultural power and a long degenerative phase in the area after the main site at Rupar was deserted. Further eastward the site at Alamgir- pur indicates the presence of Harappans in the Jumna-Ganges Doab at a rather late (post-1500 bc) stage. With such an eastern dimension and cultural momentum established, it is thus possible to examine anew the cultures of central and eastern India for evidence of further diffusion and to facilitate this a number of regions can be delineated, based partly on environmental characteristics and partly on the observed tendency of such areas to react uniformly to external cultural stimuli at various periods (Fig. 1). Region I comprises the area between the Aravallis and the Vindhyas with distinctive tracts in the Banas river valley (a) and the Malwa plateau (b)? both areas conducive to early settlement. Region II comprises the heart of the black soil area developed on the volcanic trap rocks of the north-western Deccan plateau, with the valleys of the Narmada, Tapti and upper Godavari rivers. Region III consists of the ancient Dravidian southlands, ranging from the high plateaus of the interior and upper Krishna catchment (a) to the deltaic eastern seaboard and the Kaveri valley (b). Region IV comprises the western Himalayas, with the Vale of Kashmir affording an attraction to early settlers; Region V the western-central Gangetic lowlands with extensions southward in the Chambal and Son valleys; 3The relation of early settlements to former river courses in this dried-up area of Haryana constitutes an interesting problem in historical geography, requiring both geomorphological and archaeological study. In addition to the former courses of the ancient Sarasvati and Drishadvati rivers there is a possibility that the Yamuna (Jumna) river discharged into the system rather than following its present course to the east of the Delhi Ridge. These problems have been explored by Bhan, Suraj 1972 in Prehistoric archaeology of the Sarasvati and the Drishadvati valleys (Haryana) C.2300-C.1500 bc. Unpub. PhD.

Archaeological Congress and Seminar Papers, Nagpur, pp. 125-28.</page><page sequence="5">THE ROLE OF INDIA IN THE DIFFUSION OF EARLY CULTURES 23 and Region VI the north-eastern forests, ranging from the Vale of Assam and lower Ganges (a) to the uplands of Chota Nagpur (b) and the Orissa-Mahanadi seaboard (c). In each region a basic Neolithic culture of some antiquity can be recognized, but reacting rather differently to technological innovations emanating from the west. As described above, the Banas valley appears to have played an important role within Region I in the development and transmission of culture in late and post- Harappan times. The Banas culture as revealed by excavations at Ahar and Gilund dates from ?.1800 to 1200 bc, and is characterized by abundant copper equipment, painted black-and-red pottery, mud-brick platforms reminiscent of Harappan planning, terracotta figurines of humped cattle and equipment such as saddle querns indicative of a mixed farming economy. Similarly, sites in Malwa (e.g. Nagda) have yielded evidence of Chalcolithic settlement from ?.1600 bc, with a fine stone-blade industry concurrent with copper tools and clear indications that farming communities cultivated wheat and oilseeds, and kept cattle, sheep, goats and pigs. Decorated pottery from Nagda recalls forms from Rangpur, while painted red ware with Harappan affinities has been recovered from the earliest levels of a site at Kayatha, 24 km east of Ujjain. Thus all the evidence points to Region I having received early innovations from the main Harappan area, if not actual settlers, and to having accommodated such innovations to local cultures prior to onward transmission in post-Harappan times. Diffusion northward via the Chambal valley to the Jumna riveraine of Region V is a distinct possibility, but there are also firm indications of cultural links southward to the Narmada trough and the numerous Chalcolithic sites which have been located in the western zone of Region II by Sankalia and other workers from Deccan College, Poona. Navdatoli in the lower Narmada valley provides important links between the two regions (Sankalia, 1958). Some of its pottery, particularly in the lower levels, can be classed as Malwa ware but in later phases a new type is well represented? a fine red pottery with black painted decoration known as a Jorwe ware from a site south of Nasik. Morphologically this appears to be related to the Lustrous Red ware of Kathiawar. The type site Jorwe is one of a series of farming settlements located in the headwaters of the Godavari and Krishna drainage systems and dating from 1375 to 1050 bc (C 14 dates) (Sankalia, 1955). In addition to a stone- blade industry, copper equipment?flat axes, chisels, spear heads, fish hooks? figures prominently in the material culture of such communities and the period seems to be marked by a considerable increase in the population and wattle-and- daub settlements of the area. Cotton growing on the black (regur) soils appears to have been an important feature of the agriculture then, as it is now, but a vital pastoral element is also attested by abundant remains of cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats. To the south in Region III a pastoral economy is also well indicated on a series of excavated sites extending from Utnur, Kupgal and other locations in the Krishna valley to T. Narsipur and Hemmige in the Kaveri valley. This area has long been famed for its ground stone axes but investigations into a more precise chronology of sites were initiated by the excavations at Brahmagiri by Wheeler in 1947 (Wheeler, 1948), and since then a picture of pastoral Neolithic communities has been filled out by the work of Allchin (1963) and others (Majumdar, 1966; Krishnaswami, 1960). A primary Neolithic phase has been C 14 dated at Utnur from ?.2300 to 1800 bc, characterized by an absence of metal equipment. During this period herders of humped cattle established hill-top settlements and cattle-pens and appear to have been involved in seasonal transhumance between various plateau grasslands.</page><page sequence="6">24 THE ROLE OF INDIA IN THE DIFFUSION OF EARLY CULTURES Ground stone axes, fire and the browsing of goats were their chief means of extend? ing pasture land at the expense of the forests. Shortly after 1800 bc, however, the first copper and bronze objects begin to arrive in the area and by 1500 bc metal equipment is fairly abundant among the pastoralists (Agrawal, 1971). About 1400 bc a third phase opens with the intrusion of Jorwe-type pottery and metal goods and during the subsequent four centuries the post-Harappan cultures of Region II appear to have exerted considerable influences on the plateau folk of the south. Although there are still gaps in the cultural sequence it is thus possible to recog- nize a series of innovation waves initiated on the eastern margins of the full Harap? pan culture-province in the Gujarat-Cambay area about 2000 bc, spreading through a variety of regional contexts in peninsular India, and ending up a thousand years later on the plateau edges of the deep south. In the north, however, the evidence for such diffusion is less abundant. Although Region IV may have played a vital role in linking the planting techniques of eastern India and South-east Asia with the fruit and grain districts of Iran and Afghanistan in the first steps towards plant domestication and agriculture, in the period under review there are no indications of acculturation from the Harappan Punjab. Timber, particularly Indian cedar (deodar), was undoubtedly derived from the foothill forests and indeed deforestation of the easily eroded Siwalik ridges may have contributed towards the disturbed regimes and deposition of the Indus in the final stages of the lowland civilization, but there are no signs of plainsmen penetrating very far into the mountain forests. On the contrary, those sites, such as Burzahom, that have been studied in the Vale of Kashmir have revealed cultural affinities with central Asia and northern China rather than with the contemporary Punjab. Similarly Region VI has little to show of cultural penetration from the west. The small ground axes and shouldered adzes found in abundance in the hilly areas of this region have strong affinities with the Neolithic industries of South-east Asia and China and indeed culturally one appears to be dealing with the western frontier zone here of the great forest-culture province of South-east Asia?although there are also some similarities with the early stone industries of Region III. One or two sites, however, have yielded slight indications of post-Harappan diffusion. Thus a mound in the Burdwan district of West Bengal has produced copper objects including fish-hooks from a stratum dated to ?.1000 bc and at Mahisadal in the Birbhum district a flat copper axe, associated with black-and-red ware and charred rice grain, has been recovered from a deposit dated to between ?.1380 and ?.855 bc. Various diffusion routes are possible for the penetration of this region from the west. From Tripuri, an outlier of the Malwa province, routes eastward are available via either the Son or Mahanadi valleys. Downstream move? ment along the Godavari and Krishna to sites such as Kesarapalli and Nagarjuna- kanda would also afford access to the eastern seaboard and long-short drift ot ideas. In the case of West Bengal, however, the most likely contact at this time was with the central Gangetic area?either by river or by old routes that led across the Chota Nagpur plateau. Region V is characterized archaeologically at this time by the occurrence of the so-called Copper Hoard culture (Lal, 1972). Finds of such hoards of copper implements?including flat axes, barbed harpoons, swords with antennae hilts, and curious anthropomorphic figures?have long been known from the region, particularly from the Jumna-Ganges Doab. In the Gangetic alluvium they usually occur in association with thick, water-rolled pottery known as Ochre Coloured ware. Some of the copper objects have affinities with Chota Nagpur products in</page><page sequence="7">THE ROLE OF INDIA IN THE DIFFUSION OF EARLY CULTURES 25 both stone and copper, and there are other links with flat axe forms from Harappan and Jorwe contexts. They were believed to have been the possessions of riverside communities in the Gangetic forests or to have belonged to traders serving such communities?but in the majority of cases their precise stratigraphical provenance was unknown. Recent reports by Lal, however, of excavations at Saipai in the Doab have reduced much ofthe enigma once attached to the hoards. It is now almost certain that they are associated with riverain communities who lived on the bluffs on the edges of the flood plain in hamlets of wattle-and-daub huts, fishing and hunting in the flood plain forests and tending cattle (Bos Indicus) and growing wheat on the drier land of the doab. Thermoluminescent dating of the associated pottery produces dates of 2000-1500 BC?contemporaneous with the Harappan period in the Punjab. Empirical study of the data produced by archaeological investigations thus confirms that the Harappan culture did have substantial influences on the cultural development of areas outside the Indus basin and that the leading wave of its impact continued to flow eastward for a long time after the original cities of the Indus civilization had been destroyed. Eastward of the Gulf of Cambay and the Indo-Gangetic divide, however, there is no evidence of the establishment of cities as such?what was diffused were elements of urban technology and culture in forms which increasingly departed from the original inspiration as they were transformed by successive adaptations to various cultural and environmental sys? tems. From the data it is possible to hypothesize two main corridors within which these diffusion processes appear to have been most active?namely a northern Gangetic corridor opening eastward from the Punjab between the forested foothills of the Himalayas and the broken northern edge of the ancient crustal block of peninsular India, and a southern Deccan corridor (Daksinapath) running southward from the Narmada-Tapti area across the upper part of the plateau and the head? waters of the Godavari and Krishna rivers towards the Mysore uplands. The Aravalli-Banas-Malwa zone functions as a link between the two corridors. As is indicated in Figure 2 the environmental contexts of the two corridors differ considerably. The Gangetic corridor has a western entrance in semi-arid conditions and rainfall incidence as indicated by mean annual rainfall and the number of rainy days (2-5 mm of rain or over in 24 hrs) per year increases eastward sharply (Schweinfurth, 1970). In terms of biotic potential the 1020 mm isohyet and 45 rainy days isoline, coinciding closely in the neighbourhood of the Yamuna (Jumna) and Ganga (Ganges) confluence, are significant.4 In the eastern Punjab, the Indo-Gangetic divide, and the Doab the lower rainfall, long dry season, cool winters and substantial seasonal and diurnal temperature range provide the physical 4It should be noted, however, that there is some recent evidence that the critical arid/humid threshold lay further to the west during the Harappan period. Stratigraphic and pollen analysis, with radiocarbon dating, of salt-lake deposits in western Rajasthan, a fresh water lake deposit at Pushkar in the Aravalli Hills, and soil samples from Kalibangan (see Singh, G. et al. 1974 Late Quaternary history of vegetation and climate of the Rajasthan desert, India. Proc. Roy. Soc. London. 267. B 889: 467-501) point to a considerable fluctuation of the arid/humid boundary in this zone since 10 000 bp. After a long arid period a sudden increase in lake sedges and in tree and shrub cover appears to have occurred c.5000 bp and lasted until c.3800 bp. During this period a grassy steppe-savannah type vegetation seems to have been dominant (Phase 4 of Singh), indicative of a substantial increase of rainfall and was followed by an increasingly arid period coincident with the collapse of high Harappan culture. Before this is entirely accepted as evidence of climatic change, however, it would need to be demonstrated that these fluctuations were not due to changes in the direction of river dis? charge and seepage of ground-water into the sand-girt playas of Rajasthan,</page><page sequence="8">? ;'?;' Indus civilization o Sites influenced by diffusion t_t7T Neolithic-Chalcolithic culture regions and associated sites Fig. I.

Where the water table is low, as in the central part of the doabs or interfluves, the original forest must have been somewhat open and reasonably easily cleared?giving way to coarse grassland and scrub. Farming from early times appears to have been based on pastoralism plus the cultivation of wheat and millets. Hazards of the flood plains themselves were avoided and settlements tended to be located on the terrace edges overlooking the young allu? vium. As one moves eastward, however, climatic conditions are such as to have favoured the development of an original forest cover of greater density?in the central and eastern plains and slopes of the Chota Nagpur uplands, thick sal stands with bamboo predominate in moist deciduous forest and this in turn gives way to even denser forest in the tropical semi-evergreen forest of Assam and the Bengal- Mahanadi deltaic tracts with their fringes of Sundri (Heriteera fomes), screw pines (Pandanus spp.), and palms (Nipa fruticans). To people coming from the semi- deserts and open terrains of the west, this lower Gangetic forest with its strange flora and fearsome fauna, rice cultivation and planting techniques, strange diseases of humans and animals, and closed vistas, must have seemed an awesome place? an alien world to them and their livestock. The process of diffusion in this corridor would appear to have been an initial trade penetration by boat along the great rivers followed later by a lengthy process of forest clearance and settlement. The Deccan corridor on the other hand afforded conditions of more rapid move? ment of men and livestock. Wood specimens obtained from excavations of Harappan sites in the Gujurat area indicate a light, semi-arid forest cover with several species of Acacia, Albrizzia and Tamarix, and similar conditions were to be found in parts of the Aravallis and south-western Malwa, at the northern end of the corridor. As will be noted in Figure 2 the corridor is flanked by the high rainfall and dense forests of the Western Ghats and Malabar coast to the south-west and by the rela? tively high rainfall and moist deciduous forests of Madhya Pradesh to the north- east. Within the corridor itself, well indicated by the 45 rainy days per year isoline, rainfall is surprisingly low and comes chiefly in the form of instability storms during the summer monsoon. Its forest cover was light, ranging from tropical dry deci? duous to a zone of tropical thorn forest (with acacia, sandalwood etc) along the central axis of the corridor.5 Here there were no major natural obstacles to move? ments of pastoral communities and a close coincidence can be observed between the sites associated with the diffusion of Harappan traits and the area and alignment of the corridor. Cattle-dairying cultures have persisted within this zone from very early times?the Todas (Rivers, 1906) represent a good example of survival into modern times?and on the question of whether actual human migrations were involved rather than simple transmission of traits it is perhaps significant that human remains recovered from Neolithic graves in the zone fall within the 'Cauca- soid' or 'Mediterranean' taxonomic range. It is also clear, however, that at the southern terminus of the high Daksinapath the herders of the north-west came into contact with another world?the forests, gardenlands, deltaic estuaries and lagoons, and fisher-boatmen of the Dravidian southland of the Tamil coasts. Having established a hypothesis of diffusion and given it spatial expression in a model of two corridors it is now possible to test it against later episodes in the 5It should be noted, however, that Mujumdar, G. G., and Raja Guru, S. N. (1966 p. 54) are of the opinion, on the basis of fossil soil evidence, that in northern Mysore conditions were less arid and the vegetational cover more extensive in this zone c.2000 bc and that degeneration of the ecological conditions to their present state has resulted from human interference (e.g. overgrazing by domestic stock).</page><page sequence="11">THE ROLE OF INDIA IN THE DIFFUSION OF EARLY CULTURES 29 cultural development of the sub-continent. Two such episodes can be briefly analysed. Episode B Before the diffusion of Chalcolithic traits had quite run its course in the eastern forests a new stimulus and technology appeared on the western arid horizons of the Indian world, in the form of nomadic, horse-riding, iron-using pastoralists whose migrations had been initiated by the collapse of the Hittite empire (Fig. 3). During the period 1200-1000 bc they appear to have replaced the Chalcolithic folk in the grazing lands of Baluchistan and their Early Iron Age culture is well attested in a considerable number of cairn cemeteries in that region. In the succeeding period the impact of this culture is very apparent in the Indian lowlands and espe? cially in the two corridors we have hypothesized. In the Northern corridor the process of diffusion opens with the arrival of Aryan (Indo-European) tribes in the Punjab c.noo bc and culminates c.500 bc with the appearance of iron in sites at the eastern end of the corridor. During this period, to the evidence of archaeology is added the testimony of the Vedic literature, beginning with the Rigveda and continuing through later Vedic texts to the Brahmanas (cf. Majumdar, 1951). From internal evidence it is clear that the hymns of the Rigveda were composed in the Punjab. They give invaluable insight into the culture of the Aryan cattlemen during what may be termed the 'entrance phase' of the colonization, while the environmental context of the later documents lies much further to the east?in particular centring on the Jumna-Ganges Doab, the ancient Kurukshetra of the Mahabharata epic. Archaeologically the area and the period are well defined in terms of the occurrence of a fine, well-fired grey pottery (Painted Grey Ware), first authenticated at the ancient proto-historic sites of Ahicchatra and Hastinapura (Lal, 1956) (Fig. 3). It should be noted, however, that Painted Grey Ware has not been recovered from sites east of Kausambi, and that the characteristic pottery of this period in the central and lower Gangetic area is a Black and Red Ware derived from earlier forms. The literary and archaeological evidence is thus wholly in accord with a corridor diffusion process involving: (a) An early entrance phase when Aryan tribes moved into the grazing lands of the Punjab, encountering post-Harappan communities living in the wreckage of the earlier civilization. During this phase they were essentially rural, nomadic, pastoral folk, followers of the great sky god Indra, revelling in cattle raids, horsemanship, and simple religious ritual. (b) A colonization and consolidation phase in the western Gangetic lowlands, By this time they had developed a more sophisticated culture. In addition to wheat and barley their agriculture included millets and rice and the use of the plough. A wide variety of metal equipment was used?including iron, copper, bronze, lead and tin?and iron axes in particular facilitated more rapid clearance of the woodland. Textile, metal work, jewellery, pottery and other craft industries had developed giving rise to a measure of specialization and trade. Population had increased and settlements had grown in size and function ?often beginning as defended encampments of Aryan chiefs with adminis? trative central-place functions or as ritual centres, but later adding marketing and commercial activities. Such places, recorded in the literature and now in the main identified on the ground, were to provide the basis for the rise of India's second, Gangetic, civilization. In these localities the first steps were made in the development of the caste system as a device to stabilize the ele-</page><page sequence="12">30 THE ROLE OF INDIA IN THE DIFFUSION OF EARLY CULTURES ments of a plural society of diverse ethnic and economic components and it was here also that the complex socio-religious system known to us as Hinduism (Indianism) was developed. While it is a frequently observed fact that colonial forest frontiers have often provided the setting of vigorous cultural develop? ment, the very complexity and philosophical maturity of the Indian system argue for the presence of a powerful non-Aryan contribution from the indigenous communities of this area. (c) An exploratory phase eastward during which at first traders and then groups of adventurers and settlers began to settle along the banks of the great rivers of the forested lowlands. The coming of iron allowed, for the first time, substantial inroads to be made into the eastern forests, and it was during this phase that clearances were made on the sites of Varanasi, Vaisali, Pataliputra (Patna), Champa et al. During the same period important cultural developments also occurred along the Deccan corridor. In Malwa and the Cambay area the first occurrences of iron implements are tentatively dated to c.iooo bc and here as elsewhere in central and southern India they are associated with a dominant Black and Red Ware. Much more wo*k is required on this broad category of pottery before sub-types can be arranged in chronological series but a white-painted variety appears to have been an early form. At Hallur it occurs in horizons C 14-dated to c.1000 bc, immediately following a transitional Chalcolithic phase from which horse bones have been recovered, and it is also found in early contexts near Madurai in the far south. What indications there are from excavated sites point to a characteristically rapid diffusion of the earliest traits along this corridor, but the full development of the Early Iron Age culture is associated with a remarkable burial complex that evolved later in the southern part of the zone. The South Indian Burial Complex?usually but confusingly referred to as Megalithic?comprises a great variety of grave forms, including stone circles with urn burials, legged pottery sarcophagi, cist graves (sometimes with porthole entrances), stone alignments, and rock-cut chambers.6 Although widely dispersed across the granitic and gneissic plateaus of the south and representative of con? siderable diversity of local traditions, they have certain things in common. The abundant grave pottery is predominantly Black and Red Ware, of a type known from the settlements, and, in addition to a variety of beads, small gold ornaments, and objects of bronze or copper, iron implements are universally represented among the grave goods. The latter include flat iron axes, sickles, spades, chisels, knives, tripods, lamp-pendants, tridents, horse-furniture, daggers and swords, all of so similar manufacturing techniques as to indicate a closely organized com? munity (or caste) of smiths serving the local pastoral population. That some of the cultural traits represented in this complex were transmitted from central Asia and Iran by Indo-European migrants is generally accepted, as is the proposition that others were developed from traditions already extant among the Neolithic- Chalcolithic population of the area. There are elements present, however, that cannot be entirely explained in this way and to me represent strong evidence of maritime contacts with the Red Sea, Yemen and the Persian Gulf during the first millennium bc?but that is another story. In the present context it is sufficient to There is a considerable literature on this but see e.g. Krishnaswami, V. D. 1949 Megalithic types of South India. Ancient India 5: 35-45, and Thapar, B. K. 1957 Maski 1954. Ancient India 13: 4-142. For its general cultural provenance and chronology, however, I consider the account by Allchin, B. and R. (1968) to be the most convincing.</page><page sequence="13">THE ROLE OF INDIA IN THE DIFFUSION OF EARLY CULTURES 31 remark that at the southern end of the Deccan corridor a regional personality of considerable persistence develops that cannot be entirely accounted for by the diffusion of innovations along the corridor from the north. In the convergence of cultures that appear to lie at the foundations of the cultural individuality of Dravida, seaways as well as landways must be taken into account and it should not be for- gotten that by the time the Early Iron Age developments of which we have been speaking had run their course in the south, seafarers from the Roman world were sailing to the southern ports and establishing trading bases such as Arikamedu on the Coromandel coast (Wheeler, 1946; 1954). Episode C Figure 4 depicts India in the process of achieving urbanization for the second time, a thousand years later than the first abortive Harappan occasion. The heart of this transformation was located in the Gangetic corridor where by c.6oo bc several settlements of the forest frontier described above had achieved the size, social character, functions and morphology worthy of the title of towns. Forest clearance had proceeded apace bringing into agricultural production extensive tracts of fresh alluvial soils and the possibility of rice cultivation. Population had increased in the village terrains and provided the food and labour base on which urban communities could grow, and the process of colonization had produced a political system of small kingdoms with administrative centres that took on the character of city states. As wealth grew from the land the timber stockades of the earlier centres were replaced by earthen ramparts revetted externally with baked bricks, and defences strengthened by bastions at regular intervals. Kausambi, capital of the Vatsa kingdom of the Puranas, had ramparts 9 m high and a circuit of 6-5 km. Old Rajgir, associated in the sixth century bc with the Buddha and Mavira during the formative time ofthe Buddhist and Jaina faiths, had massive dry- stone walls 40 km long (Gosh, 1951). Pataliputra, which was probably founded c.500 bc as a border fortress town of Magadha, is known to have had massive forti- fications but the presence of the modern city of Patna and the problems of excava- tion in the water-logged alluvium has prevented the tracing of their full extent. Other notable sites include Ahicchatra, capital of Pancala, mentioned in the Mahabharata as being at war with the Kurus; Varanasi, with its long traditions as a religious centre; and Tamralipti, the outport of the civilization in West Bengal. It was in towns such as these that the cultural forms of a widespread Gangetic civilization evolved, encouraged by river and road communications and the growth of commerce and a monetary system. They provided the milieu for the development of Hindu urban castes, the spread of new sophisticated philosophies such as Budd- hism, and the evolution of a common technology. By the fourth century bc the centralization of political power on cities also facilitated the creation of the Mauryan empire centred on Pataliputra and the Magadha core area. On many of the sites in the north the transformation to full civilization is con- veniently associated with a break in pottery styles?Painted Grey Ware in the western Gangetic plains and Black and Red Ware in the eastern lowlands giving way to a very distinctive, wheel-made, thin, hard, lustrous black pottery known as Northern Black Polished Ware. Its distribution, as shown on Figure 4, gives a useful indication of the direction and timing of the diffusion of Gangetic urban culture. It will be noted that once more Malwa (Avanti) plays an important role as the link zone between the Gangetic corridor and the Deccan corridor, with Ujjain as one of the most important early city sites. Ujjain appears to have achieved city</page><page sequence="14">32 THE ROLE OF INDIA IN THE DIFFUSION OF EARLY CULTURES status ?.500 bc when a great clay rampart and ditch system was built to enclose an urban area about a mile long and three-quarters of a mile wide. Within the city, brick buildings with tiled roofs flanked streets of clay-bound rubble. The drainage system included soak pits built of pottery-rings or pierced pots and excavations have produced large quantities of Northern Black Polished Ware as well as other indicators of Gangetic culture. By the Mauryan period it had become a powerful regional capital and commercial centre on the imperial highway running south from Kausambi to Bharukaccha (Broach) on the Gulf of Cambay?a route associated with early Buddhist sites such as Sanchi, Vidisa (Bhilsa) and Bharhut. South of Ujjain the crossing of the Vindhyas and Narmada river was effected from Mahismati into the territory of the Satavahanas and the northern entrance to the Deccan corridor. Bahal, Nasik and Brahmapuri have yielded Northern Black Polished Ware and evidence of the beginnings of urbanization in the third century bc. The stimulus for this may have been commercial expansion into this zone, long renowned for its cotton growing, or the extension southward of the Mauryan empire under Bindusara and Ashoka. It was accompanied by the spread of Budd? hism, and Dutt (1962, p. 112) has argued in favour of the existence of an old high? way to Pratishthana (capital of the Satavahanas) and beyond as an axis for the diffusion of early Buddhist culture. Access by this route to the Krishna valley may account for the appearance of several early Buddhist sites in this area and the diffusion of Gangetic culture eastward to the country of the Andhras. Amaravati became a great centre of Buddhism and remained so for almost a thousand years. The full development of urban culture, however, awaited the political unification of the Godavari and Krishna basins by the Satavahanas and the establishment of their empire from sea to sea in the period 78 bc?ad 218. Within its bounds, under condi? tions of peace and prosperity, considerable cultural unity was achieved and in a cultural sense it became heir in the Deccan to the Mauryan empire in the north. Although none of the Satavahana kings was Buddhist they did not resist the development of Buddhist communities from the cave groups of the Western Ghats to the great monastic complexes such as Nagarjunakonda (Sarkar, 1960) in the east. The movements of pilgrims, as well as traders and imperial officials and armies, did much to facilitate the diffusion of urban culture. In the far south cultural innovations from the north arrived by the Daksinapath ahead of the Mauryan expansion, but diffusion by seaways became increasingly significant. The early Indian colonization of the dry zone of Ceylon and the estab? lishment of an irrigation civilization centred on the city of Anuradhapura is an example of cultural leap-frogging by sea, but certainly by the beginning of the Christian era port cities had grown up oii the Tamil coastlands and the landways had been extended southward to Mysore and ultimately Madurai. Documentary evidence such as the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea1 and archaeological evidence such as that obtained from Arikamedu givt a picture of thriving commerce both by sea and land and the presence of considerable communities of native and foreign merchants, including Greeks and Romans, in bustling southern towns. The trans? formation was virtually completed by the first century ad and although northern cultural elements are powerfully present at the base of such urban cultures it is clear that they were absorbed and adapted to the local Dravidian way of life. Northern empires never embraced this area and local Red Wares and Rouletted Ware provide the pottery indicator of urban cultures in the south as Northern Black Polished Ware did earlier in the north. 7If a late first century date for it is accepted.</page><page sequence="15">THE ROLE OF INDIA IN THE DIFFUSION OF EARLY CULTURES 33 In applying the two-corridor model to processes of cultural diffusion during various episodes in early Indian history it becomes apparent that although the tempo of diffusion in the two corridors varies considerably from episode to episode as a result of different environmental conditions?with the Gangetic corridor tend? ing initially to lag behind?in the long view there is a general similarity between them. Both lead from arid areas on the margins of south-west Asia and end in forest-and-sea environments on the margins of the very different world of South- east Asia. During the episodes we have been considering the cultural set was strongly from west to east, from dry to wet, and this was to be repeated on many later occasions also. The influence of central Asian, Persian, Mesopotamian, Islamic and other south-west Asian cultures is clearly discernible during much of the early history of India. But one should not underestimate the power of Indian innovation. Ideas and cultural systems from the west?whether one is discussing architectural traits, town planning, metallurgy, or agricultural techniques?rarely remain unmodified for long. They are absorbed, reorganized and transformed in India to meet the needs of forest environments, and the cultural package ultimately transmitted eastward to South-east Asia is often hardly recognizable as one re? ceived earlier from the west. In this respect India has functioned as a great selective filter in cultural diffusion. Nor should one underestimate the ability of India to preserve a cultural element, virtually in a state of suspended animation, for long periods of time until conditions and the time are appropriate for its rejuvenation. Thus, for example, the strange phenomenon that although, as we have seen, the springs of the second urbanization of Episode C were very different from those of the Indus civilization, and separated by a thousand years, the morphology of the cities that eventually arose in the second phase and the ideals of town-planning as they were developed in the Manasara Silpa Sastras of the early centuries ad have so many features in common with the cities of Harappan times that the similarities cannot be ascribed to chance.8 The cosmological principles applied in both have a common base and the only place in which they could have survived is within the forest cultures of India, as part of a wider behavioural complex of the ritual occupation of land. This raises the issue of how many other ideas of this great forest culture have survived, or indeed been transformed and transmitted westward to south-west Asia in other guises. How much of Arab culture for example is 'Indian' culture going west? What happened to the monastic organization and ideas of Buddhism when they were diffused to south-west Asia and the desert margins of the Roman world in the last centuries before the birth of Christ ? Corridors are two-way avenues and there is no reason to suppose that the corridors of diffusion of which we have been speaking operated in only one direction. The answer to many fundamental problems such as these in the early history of man rests on the evidence which can only be produced by the archaeologists and historical geographers of India.
