<plain_text><page sequence="1">1466 REVIEWS Ecology, Vol. 56, No. 6 QUANTITATIVE BIOMETEOROLOGY: UPDATED This text1 is an expanded second edition aimed toward advanced undergraduate and graduate students in "en- vironmental physiology." The subject is defined as "the study of animal-environment relationships with particular attention to the effects upon the animal of changes and extremes of the physical environment . . . emphasis is upon the analysis of the methods whereby the animal tries to correct by homeostatic mechanisms any harmful changes in physiological status." This theme, established in the introductory chapter, guides this useful synthesis of ideas and research in stress physiology. The ten chapters deal with biological rhythms, tem- perature regulation, responses to cold and hot environ- ments, hibernation, low pressure from terrestrial alti- tude (including winged and rocket flight), high pressure from air and water and a new concluding chapter en- titled "Apemen, resources and pollution." Each chapter of the previous edition has been substantially increased by incorporating new subject matter and revising old topics to include more examples and new areas of re- search. The total volume of the book has increased over 50% (308 vs. 465 pages). Folk introduces most chapters with environmental diagrams which visually orient the reader to physiological parameters covered in later discussions. The author's past research emphasis is clear in the extensive discussion of animal responses to cold environments; this chapter covers over 20% of the text. Thus, with the chapter on hibernation, cold environments dominate the discussions of what are con- sidered "extremes of the physical environment." Chapters are generally divided to include discussion of the animal's adaptive reaction to specific environmental stimuli, fol- lowed by examples and analysis of the mechanisms which produce appropriate and necessary responses. Folk's narrative is spiced with thought-provoking questions on as yet unexplained aspects of animal behavior under physiological stress, and he has made extensive use of the literature to qualify statements on theory or sug- gested hypotheses-the bibliography lists 1045 references. Mammals, including man, are used in most examples and important points are well defined and easily under- stood. Copious illustrations (232 in total) aid in grasp- ing the significance and relationships of various topics and concepts. Chapter 2 focuses on the influence of visible light radiations and photoperiodicity on animals. A short chapter, it introduces the interplay between photo- periodism and physiological responses such as the con- trol and timing of reproduction and the effects of length and intensity of illumination (Aschoff's Rule). Morpho- logical responses (e.g., coat color) to this stimulus are only briefly mentioned. These discussions essentially preface the detailed treatment of biological rhythms found in the next chapter. Here Folk has selected an impressive number of case studies to illustrate the in- teresting variety and complexity in circadian patterns of activity and the difficulties in selecting a physiological function to monitor these rhythms. Folk also touches briefly on such items as the current theories of rhythm- causation (conditioning theory, inherited clock theory and cosmic receiving-station theory). This chapter pro- vides the student with several areas of suggested research and offers valuable information on experimental design. ' Folk, G. E. 1974. Textbook of environtmental phiysi- olUogy. (Second edition). Lea &amp; Febiger, Philadelphia, PA. 465 p. $17.50. Temperature regulation is used as an example of the principle of homeostasis. This chapter, expanded to three times its previous length, stresses mechanisms by which the organism is able to maintain body temperature con- stancy. I found the sections on heat balance and thermal neutrality particularly interesting and well presented. Although discussions incorporate both classic and modern interpretations of thermoregulatory mechanisms, little is stated on the evolutionary implications of these adaptations. No book, however, can cover in detail all aspects of a topic and those interested in additional coverage can consult other recent books on this subject (e.g., Swann, H. 1974. Tlhermnoregulation and bio- energetics. American Elsevier Publ. Co., Inc., NY). In chapter 5, "Responses to a Cold Environment," attention is captured by an absorbing account of human experiences in low temperatures (and it is interesting to speculate on the amount of new data that will be avail- able for analysis with the current construction of the Alaska pipeline!). The descriptive and informative text guides the reader through such topics as Fourier's Law of Heat Flow, responses to acute and chronic cold exposure, acclimation and acclimatization, experimental hypothermia and fat metabolism (a new topic). This chapter and the next on "Responses to a Hot Environ- ment," undoubtedly form the core of the textbook. Care has been taken to provide information and detail without the "clutter of nomenclature" normally asso- ciated with such descriptions in medical physiology texts. Far from being mere chronicles of data, the chapters emphasize and compare the unique physiological adap- tations of animals in extreme climates. Energy costs, water balance and other measures of climatic tolerance are graphically illustrated and both chapters include sections on case histories documenting specific adapta- tions of individual species. The special issue of hiber- nation is treated in a separate chapter. Here, sometimes confusing or subtle differences in terms (e.g., estivation, dormancy, permissive-, seasonal- and obligate hiberna- tions, torpor, winter lethargy) are clarified and aptly described by selected species accounts. Effects of low pressure from terrestrial altitudes above 7500 ft. are emphasized with regard to circulatory and respiratory systems (chapter 8). Ecologists will be pleased to note the comparison of alpine and arctic environments and the specific adaptations of their dis- tinctive fauna. Folk's brief paragraphs on the physio- logical control of the distribution of mammals unfor- tunately only whet the appetite; I would like to have seen this section expanded, particularly in light of cur- rent ideas on factors important in the geologically recent oscillation of species ranges. The chapter concludes with a short amended section on winged and rocket flight, including a one page table summarizing the early history of manned space flights, something which seems unduly elaborate for the cursory text. The penultimate chapter discusses the physiological consequences of high pressure from air and water and, except for the addition of several illustrations, it remains essentially unchanged from the earlier edition. The stresses imposed on diving animals still elude complete explanation but the author has used well selected and interesting sets of data in discussing the problems of carbon dioxide buildup, requirements for atmospheric oxygen, and the effects of decompression. Diving adap- tations, such as reduced metabolism, altered or reduced blood flow and oxygen storage are highlighted.</page><page sequence="2">Autumn 1975 REVIEWS 1467 The concluding chapter in this revised edition concerns the influence of the city environment and agricultural areas upon man." It is a succinct account of man's historical development in relation to the en- vironment, from the adaptative response of primitive man to modern man and his influence by modification of the environment. Apocalyptic, it centers on man's capability to perturb and transform the environment (e.g., pollution, climatic change) creating new or in- tensified problems of physiological stress, problems which may prove beyond the adaptative capacity of certain species. It is an appropriate concluding subject for an "environmental" physiology textbook. Errors are minor but numerous. The text in general suffers from poor proofreading; more time devoted to this task would have greatly added to the book's at- tractiveness. For example, occasional checks of refer- ences found more than two dozen incorrectly numbered; author's names (e.g., Armatich for Armitage), sequence or publication dates of articles were often erroneous. The quality of some figures was below standard (e.g., pp. 47, 67), others were incompletely labeled (p. 121) or had missing units (p. 115). Problems with scientific versus indefinite vernacular names pointed out in a review of the first edition (1967, Science 155:1660) remain (e.g., 'a rat-sized rodent related to guinea pigs"). Similarly, some taxonomic revisions have not been made (Citellus vs. Spermnoplhilus; Eptesicus serotinus vs. E. fuscus). Folk vacillates between metric and English systems in his units of measurement. Some discussions are anthropomorphic (p. 276). The 18 pages of appen- dices include an assortment of topics, several seemingly disjunct in relation to the text. For example, the utility of a list of biotic communities of North America (Appendix A) or the medical uses of the electromag- netic spectrum (Appendix F) is questionable. Appendix G on biometeorological or ecogeographic rules repeats definitions given elsewhere in the text (p. 129). These criticisms do not negate the importance and usefulness of this text. For the investigator beginning research in environmental physiology this book will pro- vide valuable assistance in the design and methodology of experiments; for the student and teacher it is an in- teresting and concise synthesis of the major concepts in stress physiology. Other new, related books (e.g., In- gram, D. L. and L. E. Mount, 1975. Man and Animials in Hot Einvironmients. Springer-Verlag, NY) indicate the interest and increasing attention being given to this area of physiology. Although eight years have passed between editions of this text, its lucid bridging of the gap between ecology and biometeorology still makes it one of the more important and reasonably priced texts available to students interested in physiological responses of animals to extreme environments.
