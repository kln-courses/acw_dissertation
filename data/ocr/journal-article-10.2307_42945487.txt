In the opening of Beautiful Theories (1982) Elizabeth Brass brilliantly assesses the reasons for "Suddenly, an Age of Theory." I will describe one cause which she treats briefly and add another not treated, to employ as the basis for appraisal of the book under review. Two main origins of the crisis which many perceive in the study and teaching of literature in the United States are the two chief institutional instruments of the past: the New Criticism and traditional literary history. Both have tended to isolate and thereby tri- vialize the literary enterprise. The New Critics, Brass explains, stressed the autonomy of literature- the unique ontological and autotelic status of a literary work, its independence</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 115 from the cultural context in which it originated. A work of literature became an object for analysis and appreciation by a process of exclusion of "extrinsic" contexts and by close attention to the particulars of the work. The result was an isolation of literature and English departments which threatened to render literature and English departments ever more vacuous and socially and polit- ically impotent. But no better was the traditional literary history the New Critics had opposed. Long ago in The Idea of a University John Henry Newman com- plained of the abuse of students inherent in directionless accumulation of information: "Those ill-used persons, who are forced to load their minds with a score of subjects against an examination," with little glimpse of mutual relationships or grasps of wholes. Newman anticipated but perhaps underes- timated the ferocious positivism which consumed at least graduate literary studies in the twentieth century, with its consequent exaltation of memory over coherence or imagination. René Wellek in 1963 described literary re- searchers and teachers as petty antiquarians accumulating unrelated facts about "the minutest details of the lives and quarrels of authors, parallel hunting, and source digging ... on the vague belief that all these bricks will sometime be used in a great pyramid of learning" ( Concepts of Criticism, p. 256). Although increasingly divided into sub-disciplines for research on increasingly insignif- icant subjects with even the centenary or multi-centenary surveys seeming to lead merely to fragmented, factual exams, professors and students pretended to share significant purpose through the chronologically ordered curricular requirements. The serious and responsible approach to the history of literature, to draw upon Newman again, is one which seeks principles by which one can take "a connected view of old and new, past and present, far and near . . . without which there is no whole and no centre." But how make connection? "There is no enlargement," continued Newman, "unless there be a comparison of ideas one with another . . . and a systematization of them," an approach which can avoid becoming dogmatic by emphasizing comparison. Suddenly during the last two decades a demand for theory as a corrective to the isolated and fragmentary has been heard throughout Western centers of literary study. In England Trevor Eaton in his Theoretical Semics suggests part of the way. Language as a chief phenomenon of human behavior can be studied systematically; literature as a subset of human language can fit this systematic study. In the United States Karl Kroeber in Styles in Fictional Structure calls for an "aesthetic" history of literature, the building up of a "cumulatively rewarding discipline of studies in fictional style" upon "estab- lished principles by which one can objectively and systematically compare and contrast the stylistic coherence of different novels." Other critics, such as Rob- ert Weimann in Structure and Society in Literary History, place this needed "aesthetic" history in cultural history. Their approach would ground the study</page><page sequence="3">116 Book Reviews of language and literary history within substantive issues of social and political history. For what is needed is a coordinated study of the linguistic constituents of literature within authorial and cultural history, the scattered and fragmen- tary rendered assimilable and contemplale as part of larger wholes through principles and systematic methods. Does Sharma provide such a clarifying foundation? Does he offer a sys- tematic conception of Frost through comprehensive linguistic and historical theory and methodology (without ruling out other theoretical and methodo- logical ways of explaining the author)? Is his knowledge principled and whole? And does the book provide the coordination of language, author, and culture requisite to wholeness, or does it discuss only limited aspects of the language and thought of the poet? Sharma's study of Frost "is concerned primarily" with "the figures of thought such as metonymy, synecdoche and metaphor." He proposes to dem- onstrate Frost's place in the discursive tradition of clear, matter of fact state- ment mainly via literal objects in contiguous association, clear syntax, and simple metaphors. The discursive tradition (Hardy) out of which Frost arose and the non-discursive contrast (Hopkins) are very briefly explained and il- lustrated. He makes his definition of style explicit, and he defines his chief critical terms briefly with reference to I. A. Richards and Roman Jakobson. He relates these few basic techniques to Frost's central concerns and ideas. And he employs all of this analytical foundation for evaluations of the quality of Frost's poetry. Oddly, for a book which undertakes to generalize about the features of a writer whose over 300 poems require 521 pages in the Lathem edition, Sharma offers little quantitative data. Frost relies on verbs and prefers tran- sitive sentences, yet no data beyond a few examples are presented (an no comparative data). Frost is overwhelmingly métonymie, Sharma assures us with convincing examples, yet one must ask about quantity: in how many poems, how many Unes, compared to what other poets? (Admittedly, data about other poets are lacking, a need yet to be filled, but Sharma could have provided selective data, and more recent scholarship, his latest reference being 1971.) And is Sharma's understanding truly based upon Jakobson's metonymy/ metaphor schema, or on the traditional, classical trope? He gives little attention to the nuances of the essay by Jakobson and Halle which he cites. Again, even if Frost's use of personification is "legion" and does reveal a clear link between metonymy and anthropomorphic locutions (a link not firmly established), Sharma refers only to a few passages in support of these beliefs. Frost's me- tonymy-contiguity predilection "favors" traditional, specifically hypotactic syntax, a "literary" syntax over colloquial, and he prefers simple metaphor and especially similes over "interactive" metaphors, but very few examples support these essential claims. (Sharma could have referred to William Baker's</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 117 Syntax in English Poetry, 1870-1930 [1976], which suggests how traditionally regular are Frost's sentences.) Nor is Sharma always analytically careful, notably in his treatment of the colloquial in Frost's poetry. Of the four characteristics of the so-called "colloquial" style proposed by Richard Bridgman in The Colloquial Style in America, Sharma first focuses on fragmentation of syntax. Frost does not em- ploy fragmented syntax, but writes in traditional, subordinated syntax favoring "the constant use" of hypotaxis. Later the issue is confused by Bridgman's non-linguistic fourth criterion, the "colloquial" narrator, defined by an equally non-denotative term, "conversational." Nor are the "colloquial idiom and rhythm" of "Fire and Ice" adequately explained. It is a jumbled analysis of an admittedly difficult problem with few adequate guidelines. Sharma could not have read John Childs' excellent introduction to the bibliography on col- loquial as a stylistic term (Style 14, Spring 1980), but he could have checked more of the criticism than Bridgman. So long as we keep in mind the brevity and simplicity of Sharma's study, its inflated title, and the absence of a truly comprehensive theory and com- mensurate method, we will not end the book with an exaggerated sense of achievement. Sharma could have profited by reading more on metaphor and metonymy (for example, Rhétorique générale, 1970) and books like his own which examine a writer's figures and syntax in a context of his ideas (for example, Roger Murray's Wordsworth's Style: Figures and Themes in the "Lyr- ical Ballads" of 1800 [1967], though, like Sharma, Murray is deficient in cul- tural contexts). But the book can be welcomed for its contribution to the literary history of poetry. James R. Bennett</page></plain_text>
