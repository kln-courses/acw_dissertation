Hardcover $65 The arduous journey of the Buddhist pilgrim was inspired by devotion and the possibility of divine communication and spiritual or earthly betterment (fig. 1). The Sanskrit term for a pilgrimage site, tirtha, meaning a shallow body of water, came to be used in the Jain and Hindu traditions for holy places on the riverbank or near other bodies of water. The Buddhist pilgrim seeks to pass over a metaphorical river that divides the worldly and divine realm; ultimately, she or he may cross the river of samsara , the earthly cycle of rebirth and suffering. In a splendid eighteenth-century painting from Nepal (cat. no. 29), owned by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, male and female pilgrims clothed in diverse regional costumes scale peaks, pass cities and cross streams until - at the far right of over 171 inches of painting - they are purified in the waters of Lake Gosainkund, nearly fifteen thousand feet above sea level (fig. 2). They go readily into the icy waters, in which resides their devo- tional goal, a manifestation of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, shown lying face-up in the lake. Another colorful depiction of pilgrims in a landscape setting is the stun- ning, if schematic, Japanese painting Nacht Pilgrimage Mandala, in the collection of Vassar College's Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center (cat. no. 72). It shows the same wet fortitude: two pilgrims can be seen immersed in the Kumano River, while the tall white column of Nachi Falls, a destina- tion for pilgrim purification and visual synechdoche for the nearby shrine, fills the upper right of the hanging scroll of 59 by 59% inches, and shows a monk (Mongaku) aided by two divinities in his austerities. In the fore- ground of the painting is the ocean. Devotees reenacting the crossing of the southern ocean to the island "mountain" paradise of Avalokiteshvara (called Potalaka in Sanskrit, Putuoshan in Chinese, Botarakgasan in Korean and Fudarakasan or Fudarakusan in Japanese) paddle in two boats alongside a sailboat. The skipperless craft carries the chief priest of the coastal temple Fudaraku, who is fulfilling the temple mandate for every head priest who reaches sixty-one years of age: to drift to the island paradise shut up within 180 REVIEW : PILGRIMAGE AND BUDDHIST ART</page><page sequence="2">a wooden box nailed to the hull. Such paintings were destined to travel, too, as they were carried about by Kumano nuns to preach, entice pilgrims and raise funds for the shrines. Buddhist pilgrimage has been investigated by scholars of religion with increasing frequency over the past decade. The artistic legacy and the historical and contemporary activities of South Asian pilgrimage sites asso- ciated with the Buddha have received generous attention, although cultural interaction along the "Silk Road" across the deserts of west and east Asia has been given the lions share of publications. Asia Society Museums "Pilgrimage and Buddhist Art" is the first exhibition in memory in the United States or Europe to take up the broader theme of pilgrimage. The laudable result, if dizzying in its array of cultures and objects, is grounded by a careful selection of artifacts to explore the theme. In the eponymous catalogue, eight essays map the conceptual and historical contexts of pilgrimage in India, Central Asia, China, South Asia and Japan. Two maps (placed at the end, when they should be at the beginning) locate Buddhist pilgrimage sites mentioned in the text, and chart the major trade routes conducive to the transmission of Buddhism - welcome inclusions, as many place names in the catalogue will be unfamiliar to the nonspecialist. The glossary and index are useful tools for navigating the book; the chronology less so, precisely because it cleaves too closely to the catalogue contents. The bibliography is helpful for subsequent reading. The exhibition was presented by the Asia Society in New York from March 16 to June 20, 2010. Some four years in the making, it was supported by major grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities; the E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Foundation; Lisina M. Hoch; the Mary Livingston Griggs &amp; Mary Griggs Burke Foundation; Asia: Ideas and Images, endowed by Harold and Ruth Newman; and the Ellen Bayard Weedon Foundation, among other familiar cultural institutions and indi- viduals. The exhibition displayed objects from more than a dozen ancient cultures and eleven modern countries: India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar/Burma, Tibet, China, Japan and Korea. The ninety-three pieces illustrated in the catalogue range from very ordi- nary to familiar to uncommonly charming. The catalogue begins with eight succinct essays, none more than five pages, on pilgrimage, presented in an order that reflects both cultural regions and themes. One hundred and forty pages of catalogue entries follow, each with at least one full- or half-page color illustration (of excellent quality) and, typically, 175-300 words of commentary. Each of the three exhibition and catalogue sections - "The Buddha and the Sacred Site," "The Journey" and "Merit, Mementos, and Sacred Bonds" - is introduced by the exhibition curator and catalogue editor, Adriana Proser, John H. Foster Curator of Traditional Asian Art at the Asia Society Museum. Proser also contributed to the entries, along with eleven other scholars: Terese Tse Bartholomew, Sherry Fowler, Jacqueline Ganem, Julia Meech, D. Max Moerman, Katherine Anne Paul, Ariane Perrin, Robert T. Singer, Janet Lee Spurgeon, Daisy Yiyou Wang and Hiram Woodward. IMPRESSIONS 32 181</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2. Anonymous.

The first, "The Geography of Buddhist Pilgrimage in Asia," is by Robert H. Stoddard, an emeritus professor of Anthropology and Geography at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the only author who is neither an art historian nor scholar of religion. In a few pages, it is as fine an introduction to pilgrimage and to sites in South Asia as one can imagine. He points out that the importance of a pilgrim- age site to contemporary pilgrims has little to do with its fame, UNESCO designation or notable artworks associated with it. Stoddards essay is followed by D. Max Moermans "Outward and Inward Journeys: An Introduction to Buddhist Pilgrimage." The discussion begins with a pas- sage from the canonical account of the Buddhas passing, the Mahapari- nirvana Sutra, in which the Buddha assures his devotees that anyone who dies while making the pilgrimage to the sites related to the main events of his life shall be reborn in a heavenly world. Moerman explains that in the Sanskrit version of the sutra, the worshipper "recollects" ( anusmaraniya ) the sites, whereas in the Pali text, he or she is asked to visit in person (, dassaniyani samvejaniyani, literally, "see and be moved by") - the contrast between virtual and actual pilgrimage that is the focus of his essay. He gives the example of the Japanese priest Myõe, who experienced pilgrim- age to India internally, through a meditative journey. The South Asian sites of the Buddhas birth, enlightenment, first teaching and death (Lumbini, Bodh Gaya, Sarnath and Kushinagara, respectively) declared their sanctity with the presence of a stupa reliquary. Recreations of stupas or fragments of the narrative reliefs that decorated their original exteriors and surrounds are well represented in the catalogue. A relief from Gandhara that was probably placed at the false gable of a stupa dome (cat. no. 10) shows the Buddha in meditation flanked by haloed figures, hands clasped in supplication, who "see and are moved by" the Buddha (fig. 3). The remains of the physical body of the historical Buddha did not stay in India and Nepal, but were miraculously transported and replicated in holy places as far flung as Japan. Moerman points out that it is through REVIEW : PILGRIMAGE AND BUDDHIST ART</page><page sequence="4">texts, mandalas, sculpture and relics such as those in the catalogue that the Buddha is made manifest. He also mentions the necessity of converting deities residing in the locality selected for a Buddhist pilgrimage site. "The Significance of Bodh Gaya," by Janice Leoshko, deals with frag- mented proofs for the history of what is arguably the most sacred of all pilgrimage sites. This holy place of Buddhas enlightenment is represented in the catalogue by statues and reliefs (cat. nos. i, 3, 4, 75 and 78), showing the Buddha in the "earth-touching" mudra, and a contemporary photograph of saffron-robed monks seated under the sacred bodhi tree (cat. no. 7), among other works. Leoshko offers historical and documentary evidence for the power of Bodh Gaya, and looks at the difficulty of reconstituting the "original" significance of this important devotional site, especially in light of excavations and restorations during a time when Buddhism was no longer flourishing in India. Katherine Anne Paul brings deep historical knowledge to bear on temples and pilgrimage destinations in the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau in "Bhutans Tigers Nest: A Tibetan Buddhist Pilgrimage and Popular Media." We learn that a seventh-century Tibetan king, Songsten Gampo, built one hundred and eight temples to pin down an ogress who was preventing the spread of the faith - a temple for every point of her body. Other local deities had to be quelled as well. Much of this recasting, Paul writes, was accomplished through popular media - imagery, narrative, votive objects, dance, theater - that popularized deities and sites and promoted pilgrimage. She centers her discussion on the legends surround- ing the cave at Taktsang (literally, "tigers nest"), where the exorcist Padmasambhava meditated for three months, converting the local deties and consecrating the area as holy Buddhist destinations. The portable shrines and devotional imagery of Bhutan and Tibet in the catalogue are intro- duced within a fascinating survey of the regions sacred sites.

Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, The Avery Brundage Collection, B60S255 Donald K. Swearer features Southeast Asian pilgrimage practices and traditions in "The Temple on Mount Suthep and Pilgrimage in Northern Thailand." He ex- plains that among numerous sacred sites, those removed from the activities of town life, those situated in mountainous for- est terrain, are among the most venerated. Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep is one of the twelve traditional Thai pilgrimage centers, each of which is associated with an animal in a twelve-year cycle. As in Bhutan, local- ized elements, especially those related to pre-Buddhist traditions, distinguish the establishment of Buddhism: for example, the Buddha encounters two cannibal- istic Lawa guardians of the foothill of Mount Suthep and converts them with a sermon on the Dharma. Swearer also touches on the important underpinnings of political power in pilgrimage- site narratives in northern Thailand. Two essays on China follow. In "Buddhist Pilgrimage and Mountains in China," Chün-fan Yü outlines the sacred place of mountains in Chinese religious life, early pilgrimage and the veneration of stupas ( ta ), beginning around 300 CE. As Buddhism took root in China, mythical places cel- ebrated in the sutras were recreated domestically, notably the Four Sacred Mountains of Buddhism in the Tang dynasty (618-907). Yü proposes that a dialectic relationship is established between pilgrims and sites as the devotee, attracted to the efficacy of the site, contributes to its fame through his or her journey there, talismans and memories of the trip. She concludes that pilgrimage is a fluid dynamic in China, one that is not required in the religious tradition, but one that encourages the media that perpetuate it. Even Chinese literati, she argues, can be considered a type of pilgrim when they visit a mountain site, record it in an ink landscape and commemorate the experience with a poem. In "The Sacred Topography of Mount Wutai at Dunhuang," Susan L. Beningson takes us to the tenth-century cave-chapels of Dunhuang along one of the trade routes through Central Asia. The west wall of Cave num- ber 61 is covered with emerald green, red and white panels of the mythic landscapes, pilgrimage routes, personages and apparitions associated with Mount Wutai, one of the Four Sacred Mountains of China. A circuit of the paintings, Beningson remarks, offers the pilgrim an alternative to the exacting climb up Mount Wutai. The visitor must pass through a long cor- ridor to reach the west wall and must literally walk around the cave-chapel to see the work. Three detailed illustrations show arriving pilgrims, temples and flaming lamps on Mount Wutai and a vision of Manjushri. The color- ful wall paintings stimulate other senses, too, with bells, ponds, greenery and fragrant flowers. The paintings also underscore the crucial element of 184 REVIEW: PILGRIMAGE AND BUDDHIST ART</page><page sequence="6">patronage at pilgrimage sites, here in portraits of the intermarriages and political alliances among local rulers, the Cao family and nobility from the kingdom of Khotan in Central Asia, who provided financial support for the construction of the cave and its embellishment. The catalogue section ends with the excellent historical and contemporary insights of Ian Reader in "Buddhist Pilgrimages in Japan." He notes that although pilgrimage routes like those for Kumano or Mount Fuji are im- portant, Buddhist temples form the heart of Japanese pilgrimage. Shikoku Islands eighty-eight temple route transforms the island "from a merely physical topography into a spiritual arena in which the realms of the sacred may be accessed" (Reader, 31). Here and elsewhere in Japan, the master Kõbõ Daishi is said to have founded the pilgrimage such that any who perform it follow in his steps. Mini-routes based on longer famous pilgrim- ages were created around the country, even using soil from the mother site. Figure 22a shows people stopping at birdhouse-scale replicas of the eighty- eight Shikoku temples. Modern pilgrims have spiritual goals, as well as a deep interest in the heritage of Japan; many carry modern guidebooks that outline the artistic treasures and cultural history of the places they will visit. The first section of twenty catalogue entries, "The Buddha and the Sacred Site," is dominated by the image or idea of the stupa. Few readers will fail to be charmed by the Thai manuscript pages illustrating the monk Phra Malai and a stupa in the Trayastrimsha Heaven (cat. no. 8), where he will converse with the Hindu god Indra and the future Buddha Maitreya; or to wish to have seen the actual huge Japanese woodblock-printed map of Jambudvipa, the southernmost of four continents surrounding the swirling cosmic Mount Meru (cat. no. 9). The largest of the three thematic catalogue sections, "The Journey," pre- sents fifty- two works symbolic of the inner and outward pilgrim journey: mandalas, diagrams of sacred space, which the worshipper uses in medi- tation, and accoutrements for the physical journey, such as prayer wheels and amulets. The section opens with a completely captivating devotional banner from a Dunhuang cave chapel depicting a female and a male do- nor on either side of an oversized Avalokiteshvara floating above the red plumes of their incense offering (cat. no. 21). The commentary tells us that in Chinese, "to go on a pilgrimage," chaoshan jinxiang, has the literal mean- ing of "paying ones respects to a mountain" and "presenting incense." Here, it illustrates a favored method of making direct contact with the deity through offerings. The final nineteen items under the heading "Merit, Mementos, and Sacred Bonds," are mainly votive tablets and mementos of the places experienced by the pilgrim. As Proser notes in her introduction, the pilgrim may also accrue merit and leave a reminder of his or her wishes by depositing one of these objects at the pilgrimage site. A Tibetan clay votive plaque, or tsha-tsha , was transported from a sacred site in India and treasured within the interior of a Tibetan metal image (cat. no. 83). Although the three catalogue theme/sections are somewhat arbitrary, any attempt to characterize aspects of pilgrimage would be equally so. The IMPRESSIONS 32 185</page><page sequence="7">short introductions to each section sufficiently set the stage for understand- ing the material and artistic production that was not only stimulated by the act of pilgrimage, but was mutually constituting. The catalogue would do well to make this point clearer, and to balance more forcefully the excellent presentation of the spiritual goals of pilgrimage and ostensibly mundane contributory factors such as politics, economy, individual gain or contested territory - which are nonetheless at the core of Buddhism on the ground. Material and artistic evidence of pilgrims or their destinations are of great interest to the historian, art historian and scholar of religion, but we are reminded by the diverse forms of pilgrimage presented by the authors and the catalogue entries that their value is not a modern construction. The many devotional paintings, amulets and other portable votive items (cat. nos. 55-61, 74-87), special jacket (cat. no. 92), ritual cabinet cum backpack (cat. no. 62), prayer wheels (cat. nos. 52, 53), maps (cat. nos. 9, 36, 38, 42) and other goods demonstrate the value that the physical and artistic structure of the journey held for devotees (fig. 4). Upon reaching their destination, they welcomed not only spiritual benefits, but also visual and material reinforce- ment, as the demarcation of the sacred sites with stupas, the placing of relics within embellished containers and the profuse decoration of sacred sites - especially stupas - with narrative sculptural reliefs of the Buddhas life all relate. These objects commemorate, legitimate, reinforce, recall, em- bellish, document and sanctify the act of the pilgrimage. Here and there, the great variety of viewpoints and cultures represented by the works threatens to crowd the theme. It is tempting to quibble with the juxtaposition of popular with more orthodox works. I do not find successful the pairing of the Gandharan schist sculpture of the Buddhas first sermon at Sarnath (cat. no. 6) with the Matthieu Ricard photograph of the monks beneath the Bodhi Tree (cat. no. 7) - although a painted Tibetan Thangka of a Monastery Complex (cat. no. 32) is perfect with a C-print photograph of Drepung Monastery y Tibet , by Nancy Jo Johnson (cat. no. 34), on contigu- ous obverse pages. Katsushika Hokusais (1760-1849) woodcut of pilgrims climbing or meditating, heads shaved, in a cave on Mount Fuji, is awkward opposite Kim Hongdos (1745-1806) delicate rendering of the Alms-Bowl Pond in the Diamond Mountains (cat. nos. 41, 40). Yet, it is this cornucopia of familiar, mass-produced, common, self-consciously artistic, fragmented, representational, symbolic, ephemeral, craft, precious and personal works, each with its own story and imprint on the pilgrim or the pilgrimage site, that makes the catalogue so fascinating. Like Hokusais pilgrims, tired yet determined, or the ubiquitous mold-cast clay amulet, so worn yet so mean- ingful, the various works, succincdy described in typically half-page entries, are brought to life through the personal connection that we can imagine between the place and the pilgrim, the image and the activity, the object and its owner. Even when the catalogue entry fails to clearly articulate the relationship of the work to pilgrimage, as it does in at least a dozen cases, the essays or the catalogue themes usually provide sufficient context. There is much to be learned and inferred from the catalogue, especially by studying the images of the works along with the short entries. There are one or two curious omissions, most notably, any reference to a remarkable 186 REVIEW : PILGRIMAGE AMD BUDDHIST ART</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 4. Buddhakshetra Votive Plaque and Mold.

Holton Collection, 36.325a, b exchange between art historians Susan Huntington and Vidhya Dehejia (missing from the text and the catalogues bibliography) concerning the signifying or epistemological function of representations of the important places of the Buddhas life.1 They address aspects of the Buddha, such as footprints or stupas, representations that have traditionally been called "aniconic." Their discussion is relevant in light of the representations of stupas and sacred place in several South Asian narrative scenes in the exhibition and in the broader discussion of those who "see and are moved by" the site of the Buddhas activities. Vidhya Dehejia offers that a visual narra- tion of an event in the Buddhas life frequently implies a subtext referring to the site of that event, or, conversely, to the person whose thoughts or actions converted the given object into a religious emblem. Because the three Gandharan narrative relief scenes in the exhi- bition with early dates (cat. nos. 5, 6 and 10) clearly represent the Buddha in anthropomorphic form, the debate between Huntington and Dehejia may not seem relevant. But the fact that the gist of Huntingtons argument concerns the practice of pilgrimage and the representation of sacred sites as a way of revising the so-called 4 aniconic" theory of images and their links to the biography of Sakyamuni Buddha means that there are implications for all representations of sacred sites, whether or not the Buddha is depicted.2 Dehejia counters, "a variety of emblems, including footprints, a seat or throne, a parasol, and a pillar of radiance, were frequently used, singly or in combination, to represent the person of the Buddha in a narrative art that was primarily concerned with the biography of the Buddha," but that these "emblems" have multiple aspects of meaning.3 They constitute the Buddhas presence as "absent signifier."4 The exhibition catalogue takes the narrative scenes of the Buddhas life literally, but also notes that the pilgrimage tradition at stupa sites in areas such as Gandhara, distant from the sites associated with the Buddha in the Ganges River basin, were instrumental in spreading the Buddhist teachings and practices (cat. no. 6). The significance of these representations far from the actual sites of the Buddhas life events can be extended by the debate on emblems. Namely, do such scenes principally represent the sites of the Buddhas life or do they make a multivalent visual reference to the devotional pilgrimage act of the Gandharan viewer as well as to the events at the actual site depicted in the relief? One might also have wished to see more on the syncretic nature of the "Buddhist" sites and objects in Pilgrimage and Buddhist Art, It has become fashionable to eschew terms like "syncretic" (instead, accepting as self- evident that Buddhism is not a monolithic body of beliefs), but for many readers, explication of mixed beliefs would have been both engaging and enlightening. Many works in the show demonstrate mixed beliefs, and several essays touch on this fact as part of Buddhist praxis, but greater em- phasis is needed. This was not a luxurious exhibition, nor is the catalogue remarkable in its design or presentation. The physical book is unnecessarily large, and the endpapers, cover material and design and overall layout are unimpressive. IMPRESSIONS 32 187</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 5.

What counts most, however - the quality of the illustrations - is fine. The presence of the Buddha is evoked everywhere in this catalogue. As we travel through its pages, we gain a sense of sacred place and time not un- like that experienced by the pilgrim. We make our own pilgrimage through its pages. We learn that pilgrimages can be physical, contemplative, picto- rial, devotional and otherwise - but their aspiration is always qualified by belief that the goal can be realized. The editor and authors of this useful and interesting volume have achieved the goal of simplifying and edify- ing a vast range of examples and cultural contexts for the reader interested in pilgrimage in Asia, and the artifacts associated with the practice. It is a soaring achievement, as the final illustration (cat. no. 93) of Mount Kailash in Tibet, glowing white in the morning light above fields of pilgrims' prayer stones, seems to reinforce (fig. 5).
