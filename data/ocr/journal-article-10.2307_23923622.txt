<plain_text><page sequence="1">(RE)FACING PROSOPOPEIA AND ALLEGORY IN CONTEMPORARY THEORY AND ICONOGRAPHY James J. Paxson The theorization of personification (or prosopopeia) and allegory still finds spotty representation in the scholarly publication record. This is especially so for literary or cultural theory, and it is so for iconography and art history as well. Never unimportant subjects in the criticism of literature and art—especially postmodern literature and art—these two closely connected devices or modes nonetheless have received spurts of theoretical attention. The 1960s and 1970s gave us Angus Fletcher's still unsurpassed Allegory: The Theory of a Symbolic Mode ( 1964) along with the conceptually climactic work of deconstructionist Paul de Man—such as his 1967 essay "The Rhetoric of Temporality" and his 1979 Allegories of Reading— which at times seemed to expand allegory and personification or prosopopeia to include all forms of representation or cognition.1 That effect had in fact often ren dered the two terms non-useful for traditional literary criticism—or iconography, to say the least. If there was a capstone study on prosopopeia itself, it was probably Steven Knapp's Personification and the Sublime (1985), a book that sought to wrestle in a limited way with postmodern developments in allegory theory as it reexamined Romanticist poetics, the modern crossroads of these ancient aesthetic phenomena.2 Such various splittings in the broad critical consciousness of literary studies therefore exacerbated a rift with iconography and art history, for which allegory and personification had never been as problematic in the first place. Land mark and inimitable books such as Erwin Panofsky's Studies in Iconology (1939) and E. H. Gombrich's Symbolic Images (1972) provided durable frameworks for the study of allegorical or symbolic visual art that still serve us today.3 So from the start, theory coming out of literary and cultural studies must open a dialogue with this more isolated and durable tradition in the study of allegory and personification. Yet very recently, as the twentieth century drew to a close, whole books dedi cated to these subjects in literary and cultural studies have been hard to find. Perhaps the wane of high theory, the incursion of subjects fraught with contention for many—such as identity politics, personalist criticism, queerness, post Studies in Iconography 22 — 2001 1</page><page sequence="2">coloniality—and a return of very traditional historicism in the study of pre-modern representational forms have helped curb direct interest in allegory and personi fication. One must look hard for the occasional book wholly dedicated to them or for new books that perhaps "euphemistically" place these modes (or tropes) at their theoretical and topical centers. Here would be likely ground for better intersections among literary or cultural and iconographie theory. Four recent books—Gordon Teskey's Allegory and Violence (1996), Vicki Kirby's Telling Flesh: The Substance of the Corporeal (1997), Tom Cohen's Ideol ogy and Inscription: Cultural Studies After Benjamin, De Man, andBakhtin (1998), and Michael Camille's Mirror in Parchment: The Luttrell Psalter and the Making of Medieval England (1998)—treat allegory and personification as central topics, making important contributions to literary theory as well as to iconography and art history.4 One book, Kirby's, sets out as a document in feminist theory and semiotics without at all directly bothering to take up such old labels as allegory; here is a study that I find treats this essay's subjects euphemistically. Teskey's book, I believe, tries to function for the 1990s as Fletcher's book did for the 1960s; it provides the most penetrating insights about visual allegory in the Renaissance in some decades, all in the context of some carefully chosen paintings—both Renaissance and modern—exactly as Fletcher's study had done. Camille's Mirror in Parchment, an art history book proper and the latest installment in the author's marvelous chain of sequelae treating errant or "marginal" images in the illuminated manuscript tradition of late medieval Europe, not only historicizes the documentary status of Geoffrey Luttrell's personal objet d'art and sacred text, but makes all sorts of innovative though often implicit findings about allegorical and iconographie enfacement, the phenomenological motor or armature of rhetorical prosopopeia, while it maps the late medieval ideology of agricultural production, domestic consumption, and feudal patronage. Cohen's dense and difficult study thinks together the theoretical heritages of America's "father of deconstruction," Paul de Man; German critic, philosopher, and one-time Warburg School manqué, Walter Benjamin; and Russian cultural critic, Mikhail Bakhtin (an effort that suitably places Cohen's project along side of Camille's recurrent forays into Bakhtinian cultural analysis). Cohen's work marks, since the research of de Man himself or of J. Hillis Miller and Barbara Johnson,5 the literary academy's most sustained attention to the poetics of proso popeia and allegory. Cohen takes no interest in pre-modern culture or literary and artistic forms as do Camille and Teskey; but his approach ultimately hinges on visual iconography—specifically of a cinema of the repressed and traumatic. As a preview of his theoretical program in his earlier book Antimimesis (1994) con cludes, the visual invention of things such as the personification of memory or the 2 Paxson: Prosopopeia and Allegory</page><page sequence="3">cinematic staging of one's maternal origins and traumatic biographical fissures proclaim the apostrophe of nothingness, that is, the rhetorical calling upon the nothingness (recall that apostrophe or ecphonesis is the trope of calling upon and thus personifying the non-human) that lies at the brink of human being or consciousness and deep within its partly erased traumas.6 These findings about the liminality of human language, consciousness, and the function of the cinema as a "rhetorical unconscious," as it were, program Cohen's subsequent discussions on subjectivity in Ideology and Inscription, making this newer work indispensable to current theorization of the coded, self-reflexive representational forms that enable the artistic exploration, especially through cinema and other visual modes, of em bodiment, materiality, symbolic displacement, iconicity, and the energies of erotics, sensuous desire, and physical dread. A postmodern and para-psychoanalytical investment in sexual desire, violence, intense pleasure and pain, bodily execration, abjection, and dismemberment (as well as re-memberment/ing), characterizes all four of these recent books. If allegory once connoted ethereality, transcendence, or the expression of Platonic idealism to many students of the mode, it has come of age in the theoretical domain of body theory, an effect forcefully seen in this handful of provocative and, I hope, representative studies. The four books treated as case subjects in this essay champion a new materiality or enhanced materialism of allegory which I believe can help resuscitate interest in one of art and literature's most important pre-modern modes of representation. This revitalizing "new materialism of allegory," as we might call it, seems symptomatic of late 1990s thought, as directly evinced even in some of the productions of popular cinema it self.7 It may be just such a new materialism, one which owes its materiality to rhetoricalist protocols, that holds even further promise for a field that has already made strong interdisciplinary strides. The brisk, foregoing introductory overview of my four case subject studies has, I hope, also brought out the Bakhtinian cast to my assemblage of titles: as Bakhtin urged our articulation of the "dialogical" energies inside literary works (in which, say, early novels or romances revealed the stratified layers of discourse rep resentative of social classes or orders that seemed to echo off or be in conversation with one another),8 so I see the four titles I treat here developing ideas about personification and allegory in very productive, felicitously dialogical ways. None of these books stands as a deliberate effort in rhetorical theory; but all help us in the revival of the stock in trade of classical and medieval rhetoric. In The Poetics of Personification (1994) I tried to reconcile or synthesize the classical rhetorical tradition ofprosopopeia—tracing its medieval genealogy through the great didactic or satirical allegories largely in the Middle English tradition Studies in Iconography 22 — 2001 3</page><page sequence="4">(Chaucer's dream poems and Langland's Piers Plowman)—with the contemporary and pyrotechnic instantiation of the figure or trope in deconstructive writing. My efforts largely showed how poetic use of personification, and metanarrative elements about personification in allegoiy, recorded self-reflexive images of the trope—images of containment, enfacement and defacement, concealment and corollary penetration. Paul de Man showed how poetically presented images offace in theory signalled the rhetorical framework of prosopopeia as a mechanism of subjectivization or formal operation. The rhetorical obsession with face had always taken the central ground in deconstructive thought about subjectivity and in research on prosopopeia.9 Compounding this drift in my project was the need to somehow reconcile the two, often antithetical, understandings of allegory in the modern critical scene. On the one hand, for medieval and Renaissance scholars in large, allegory still means the difficult formal expression of some transcendent or ineffable meaning; this is the track taken likewise by traditional scholarship following Panofsky or Gombrich. On the other hand, for poststructuralists working in the wake of de Man, allegory was either the inscription of "sheer anteriority," as he declared in his famous essay "The Rhetoric of Temporality"—it was the mechanical pointing of allegorical signs to prior ones in a regressive, temporal system—or it was the expansive synonym for all human cognition signaled in any act of human reading in general; thus de Man's broad aphorism, "All allegories are always allegories ... of the impossibility of reading.'"0 This conflicting set of definitions—the traditional versus the decon structive or deManian—has helped stall real progress in allegory theory, while per sonification theory often falls off the table completely. Although espoused with conviction by writers like myself, the rhetorically self-conscious semiotics of allegory and personification (that is, allegory and per sonification understood as structuralized sign-systems that record the lacunae or aporias of their own logical and rhetorical fabrics) has made for an attenuated tra dition in theoretical work on the two modes or tropes. For instance, a signally placed, very recent essay on personification published in a respected and technically minded journal of literary criticism seeks to reconstruct the history of how "mainstream personification" has been addressed in many theoretical models." But the essay's authoritative picture entirely leaves aside deconstructive achievements as if they'd never happened. The essay's "reconstruction" sets out to sort classical texts (Quintilian serves as ground zero for the discussion) as well as climactic, eighteenth-century pronouncements about the diffuse sort of personification (i. e., personification as local "animate metaphor") favored in lyrical poetry; it then dwells on neoclassical poetics and ignores far too much else—both medieval and postmodern. And incidentally, the centering of personification theory in eighteenth 4 Paxson: Prosopopeia and Allegory</page><page sequence="5">century writings has also fostered the insistent separation of allegory from personification, a counterintuitive move (for medievalists) that yields another con ceptual fissure in rhetorical work in the field.12 Work that insists on vital links between personification (or prosopopeia) and allegory and that takes up the postmodern, poststructural line of theorization— investing in semiotic aporia, abjection, violence, fragmentation, actual bodies, and philosophical materials alternative to the normative tradition of classical rhetoric as well as classical, patristic, and neoclassical formulas—therefore refreshes and energizes current theory and criticism (if even by kicking the fragmentation that stigmatizes the academy's business status quo up a notch). I have always insisted that the relinking of allegory and prosopopeia is the key to revitalizing allegory theory for literary criticism and art history. The recent books by Teskey, Kirby, Camille, and Cohen clearly serve prominently in this small, energizing vanguard. Teskey's Allegory and Violence is unmatched by any book in allegory theory, I think, since Fletcher's great study of nearly forty years ago. Less a recognition of the continued promise of psychoanalysis for literary theory than was Fletcher's Allegory, Teskey's book does operationally proceed like Fletcher's: texts in classi cal philosophy and literature, medieval allegory, Renaissance painting and poetry, early modern history and philosophy, and modern literary theory punctuate an im mensely erudite and synthetic attempt to give some basic definitions of allegory as well as a small list of systematically clarified, related concepts. A select gallery of paintings governs the book's procession. Teskey's cryptically brief title bespeaks its debt to anthropological thinking in general and to René Girard's famous study of violence and the sacred in particular.13 The Girardian slant indicates a struc turalist tendency in Teskey's sense of organizing such concepts (which I'll detail more in a moment), although his whole conceptual edifice, his very tone of writing and vocabulary, must be branded Nietzschean, perhaps even existential. Like virtually all theorists of allegory, Teskey begins at a philological ground zero: allegory means "to say other" or "other speak," from alios agourein in classi cal Greek (1). But from that minimal point, the Nietzschean ethos and vocabulary take over quickly. Allegory crystallizes the violence of thought, as Teskey makes clear again and again in authoritative, sweeping generalizations dominated by a rhetoric that is unmistakably—as Neil Hertz has said of deManian writing—lurid.14 Allegory, and one of its chief subcomponents, cognitive "capture," involve the taking hold, seizing, consumption, and digestion of prior image or sign systems to create something new. The "otherness" (alios) of allegory serves as the object in an energetic process the conceptual framework of which, as I've suggested, seems cobbled together from Nietzschean, Heideggerean, and materialist sentiments: Studies in Iconography 22 — 2001</page><page sequence="6">At the root of the motives for allegorical expression is... instrumental meaning, meaning not as a representation of what already is but as the creative exertion of force. We saw that meaning exerts force by driving a wedge into some part of nature in order to make two opposed things, two "others," or by yoking heterogenous things together so that one may be thought to refer to the other or both may be thought to refer to different aspects of a single, invisible truth. In every case, however, the object on which the force is exerted belongs to a realm that is intolerably "other" before it is raised to the position of the transcendental "other." This archaic, negative other marks the point at which instru mental meaning exerts force on what is to that meaning a chaos." For the remainder of the book, Teskey develops this provocative insight—one rhetorically founded on the displaced language of Nietzschean elementary power philosophy as well as the language of modem energy physics and Darwinian biology. "Capture" is the particular aspect of allegorical thought whereby the "other" is taken in and transformed into a higher metaphysical quality (in Platonic traditions), especially an abstract signified (of which ethical personifications often serve as the most recognizable narrative actants). Since Teskey's book deals in his own pro fessional trade—Renaissance politics and Spenserian mythopoesis—the formulation of this philosophical concept is not far from the requisite images of mythological violence with which we are all familiar. "In my opinion," Teskey writes, "allegory has its origin in that process of hierarchical ordering which is in reaction to the chaos of Saturnian, allelophagic desire."16 Here, too, is another key concept and the book's paramount neologism: allelophagy ("other-eating"), which means the reductive process itself in allegorical thought whereby "others" must be eaten by— or themselves consume—their mutual counterparts. Teskey claims, "Allelophagy is the political expression of the confrontation, implied in the word allegory, of opposite others.'"7 The image of the tyrannical Titan devouring his children is only the most lurid mythographic version of this cognitive and materialist struggle em bedded in all human thought, all human activity. Renaissance art—the monumentalist or triumphalist painting of Piero della Francesca, Pietro da Cortona, or Tiepolo—thematizes the allegorical tenor of both Dante and Spenser. Hierarchical systems of order must be visualized and drama tized by showing intransigent elements being brought under domination; and so pageant-processions, celestialized court scenes, and theophanies abound. The mod ernist analogues to these Renaissance philosophical and social representations— political repression, torture, the monolithic state, the abuses of the body politic, the panopticon—materialize in works ranging from the fiction of Conrad to the Orwellian or Kafkaesque political paintings of Max Beckmann (whose disturbing 1938 Birds' Hell actually serves as the book's dustcover illustration; and indeed Max Beckmann serves Teskey as Max Ernst or Giorgio de Chirico served Fletcher 6 Paxson: Prosopopeia and Allegory</page><page sequence="7">in Allegory). But the processes of hierarchization, repression, and ordering—both political and hermeneutical—always can be reduced by Teskey to the materialist dicta of capture, allelophagy, digestion or atomization, and anagogy. The inevita bility of such processes, and resistances to them (Dante's Francesca da Rimini stands as paramount exemplum of a human figure resisting mere reduction to personi ficational stuff), makes for the allure of allegory: "What excites interest in alle gorical agents is their seeming to be built up out of the material remains of the past in a manner that violates the original state of those remains."18 Teskey's Nietzschean language reminds one too of the words of a police detective, a city coroner, or a paleontologist. Or, in making explicit use of the quasi Marxian theory of allegory pioneered by Walter Benjamin (and consequently en shrined by the deManian legacy in allegory theory—this, to repeat, is the theory which sees "allegory" merely as a linear sequence of signs pointing back to one another and thereby delineating only "anteriority" or "sheer temporality"), Teskey writes further: "The basis of allegory ... has become a theory of history in which persons are reduced to an indifferent substance—the masses—in which abstractions (tendencies, classes, forces) inhere."19 Or, giving this process its requisite classical mythographic turn, Teskey declares: "It is therefore imperative for me to state that by 'metaphysical decay' in late antiquity I do not mean the suppression of pagan forms of worship [but] ... the rotting of the classical gods."20 Mount Olympus becomes a cosmic compost heap. The gods in Christian hermeneutical frameworks, the political enemies of Cesare de Borgia who suffer butchery in the dux's intrigues, the citizens of the Hobbesian body politic, all of nature itself in the "anagogical" paradigm delineated by Northrop Frye in Anatomy of Criticism21—all of these "others" must be consumed and absorbed by the mechanism of human cognition itself, which is violent and irresistible. Teskey's materialism sounds ruthlessly reductive; but it does manage to redefine allegory in ways that interest me the most: the reappropriation of per sonification or prosopopeia as the mode of allegory's most important trope via the foregrounding of the body or figura, classical rhetoric's phenomenological locus, as Quintilian himself emphasized in the Institutio oratoria (9.1.10-11).22 The allelophagic designation, although often cast as a nightmarish version of biological Darwinism, can reconfigure prosopopeia—the rhetorical mechanism whereby rhetorical and physical bodies get "made" in the first place and fictional charac ters get "elevated" to metaphysical abstractions or "reduced for that purpose to substance" (25)—as a perfect, structural corollary or binary counterpart to "capture" within a larger system called "allegory." Teskey's paradigm thus reinvigorates the language of structural spectra or continua once elucidated by Roman Jakobson Studies in Iconography 22 — 2001 7</page><page sequence="8">and Ferdinand de Saussure,23 while it pays tacit heed to the ur-tradition of Quintilian. Teskey writes: [T]he figure of personification is a superficial manifestation of what is happening in an allegory, having been thrown up from below by forces obscurely at work in the struggle at the rift. As for capture, it is not so much a literary figure as it is a moment of revelation in which the origin of figures may be seen. To distribute personification and capture at opposite ends of a continuous field within which allegory functions as a system ... is to conceal the disorder with which and out of which allegory works.24 Capture marks a marginating process par excellence—"a moment of revelation in which the origin of figures may be seen." This explicitly deManian formulation, which regards a category putatively outside of language and figure and that records the coming into being of figure, stands in common too with the neo-deManian poetics of allegory and personification proffered by Tom Cohen in Ideology and Inscrip tion. I will return to this notion shortly. But the notion of a structural continuum charts not personification and allegory as binary opposites, but rather personification and capture—both devices, as Teskey writes, that are "superficial" or minimal in semiotic functionality. Yet the implicit Saussurean foundations of Teskey's scheme speak strongly to the struc turalist turn that allegory theory has never been able to get away from. It is the enshrinement of Saussure, in fact, that launches Vicki Kirby's feminist study of corporeality and metaphysical language in Telling Flesh, a book not at all explicitly about allegory or personification but one that occults and then uncovers the rhetor ical motors that inhabit Teskey's literary-historical or art-historical project in Allegory and Violence. Kirby devotes her first chapter, "Corporeal Complexity," to exploring the "slash" or "bar" that marks Saussure's influential distinction between signifier and signified. (Recall Saussure's little diagram containing a picture of a tree standing next to the word arbor.25) The Swiss linguist's metaphysical act of making that distinction, and even the purportedly poststructural attempts to inter rogate the same distinction (including even Derrida's career-long project), never come completely to grips with the materiality of signification as a cognitive and "enfleshed" process. The matter of Saussure's signified and the linguistic aspect of his signifier collude in a way that theory has never fully accounted for: "As a pro ductive force with constitutive power, language does more than provide a passive and neutral medium through which matter passes. Language is now a process of 'making matter,"' as Kirby concludes early on.26 Kirby self-consciously treats the Saussurean conceptualization of signs using the scientistic imagery of electromagnetism (semiotic difference "plays across a 8 Paxson: Prosopopeia and Allegory</page><page sequence="9">generalized force field") and lurid physiology or clinical anatomy ("the body of the sign is never not engorged with the whole of the language system"). The effect is to foreground for us "Saussure's active repression of the body of the signifier [which] reiterates the somatophobia (phallocentrism) of Western metaphysics that renders matter [ironically] immaterial."27 The putting together of these notions—matter's ironic immateriality, body-fear, and phallocentrism—will remind one of Judith Butler's prolonged critique in the neo-Derridean vein,28 a critique that Kirby spends her entire fourth chapter ("Substance Abuse") responding to carefully. But it is of significance to note initially that Kirby's trope of the sign-body evokes an incipient anthropomorphism or prosopopeia, faithful motors of allegory, as she tries to trace the marginal life of human cognition's semiotic capacity itself as a material business. Kirby then discusses three preternatural phenomena to capture the notion of non- or prelinguistic sign-making at a literal and dramatic level: dermigraphism (the exhibiting by hysteria patients of scratches or actual writing spontaneously on their body surfaces), as it had been studied by Freud's own Doktorvater, the great Jean Martin Charcot at Paris's Salpêtrière; synaesthesia and the production of music by deaf persons such as Evelyn Glennie; and hologrammy, in which laser photography produces an entire image of an object even in the smallest of broken shards yielded by a shattered hologram plate. These uncanny phenomena help Kirby to merely dra matize quotidian cognitive experiences; they show how "it is as if the very tissue of substance, the ground of Being, is [a] mutable intertext—a 'writing,' that both circumscribes and exceeds the conventional divisions of nature and culture,"29 the greatest of structuralism's binaries. Taking this discussion through contemporary feminism's critiques of struc turalism and deconstruction, Kirby addresses even quantum theory30 in order to, one might say, remysticalize analytical language (a move familiar to those of us who have admired medieval mystical writers like Hildegard of Bingen) and to rethink poststructuralism from the inside, but an inside made again aware of the life of matter, flesh, bodies. Kirby, in a word, subscribes to a marvelous (and convincing) sort of universal animism in her attempt to recombine matter and mind; her project hinges on a latent though universal prosopopeia, allegorical engine par excellence, to be sure. And like Teskey, she places much emphasis on a powerful coinage: "Through the neologism, 'corporeography,' I tried to suggest that representation is 'sensible' in that biology is not a supplementary ingredient to be included or excluded. The body is more than a mere visitor to the scene of writing: the body is the drama of its own re-markability."31 Kirby's dense philosophical discussion remedies Derrida's dictum that "there is nothing outside the text"32 (that is, outside language or consciousness) by Studies in Iconography 22 — 2001 9</page><page sequence="10">reinstalling the body, flesh, matter in the fundamental process of cognition. Yet this uncanny or mystical approach fantasizes the enabling mechanisms of sign-pro duction and representation always as a sort of prelinguistic, proto-figural capacity of matter itself. The fantasized capacity, as I've just noted, marks a latent discursive prosopopeia. And it marks too a point of intersection with the high-deconstructive theoretical writing of Tom Cohen. We had seen this conceptual impulse in Teskey's theory of the violent origins of allegory: the allelophagic urge, proto-action of sign making or representation, comes out of the physical fact of bodies unleashing or absorbing energies. (Yet Teskey's violent picture will shape up for feminist readers as an almost archetypally masculist rendering of the energies or tendencies visible in all bodies; Kirby's ecologically sensitive picture also locates the animist buzz "deep down things," as Hopkins would say,33 but in violence-pruned feminist, nurturing chords.) In Kirby and Cohen, prosopopeia stands as the name or concept of some prelinguistic, purely material domain of phenomenality that metaphysical thought wishes to push outside of language and figuration but which enables and founds language. Kirby, as I've noted, does not use the key terms from allegory theory; but Cohen, being the last unrecanted deManian in literary theory today, revels in de Man's own lurid and periphrastic rhetoric. Cohen's Ideology and Inscription, on the face of things, provides a long medi tation on the institutional usurpation of cultural studies in today's academy. With its fetishized archivism, the historicism of cultural studies and other current critical approaches erases or forgets the progress made during the brief tenure of decon struction, with its intensive and liberating rhetorical self-reflexivity. "What the 'story' of Bakhtin's production now suggests," Cohen declares, "is that aspects of the politically progressive trends of the 1980s . . . must return to interrogate prob lematics of figuration and linguistic materiality to recalibrate the tasks of cultural criticism ... ,"34 Cohen enlists the thought of Benjamin, de Man, and Bakhtin in order to show how each ultimately erodes the totalizing power of historicism, a process that Cohen audaciously shows held a kind of equivalence in Benjamin's later thinking (ca. 1930s) to Euro-fascism (107)! Via a series of sophisticated readings of Hitchcock films—and it is this ocular deployment of deconstructive theory cum the Lacanian psychoanalysis of film theorist Slavoj 2izek35 that animates Cohen's whole enterprise as a radical project in deconstructive iconography—Cohen centers the "alternative" vision of mimetic deconstruction within his theoretical source writers on, of course, allegory. This most preferred topic of Benjamin and de Man, how ever, transforms in Cohen's hands into yet another coinage (as it had for Teskey): As a means of conjuring this alternative site, 1 defer proposing merely to modify the term allegory—a self-canceling, or depleted term, as we will see, all but unusable today— 10 Paxson: Prosopopeia and Allegory</page><page sequence="11">with a simplification like allography.... Keeping something in play of what Benjamin terms "materialistic historiography," allography suggests the shifting mechanics of a certain technology of inscription implied. . . . Such a task might be preceded by iden tifying where, if at all, the term "allegory" in Benjamin was recirculated, that is, not as a modified trope of literary aesthetics, but as a techne of historial intervention as such.36 Like Teskey, Cohen rehabilitates allegory into a means of "historial intervention," or, following de Man, as a paradigm for human cognition itself. Prosopopeia, conse quently, is the "prelinguistic" or préfigurai process of this mode, and it often as sumes the guise, in cinematic iconography (Hitchcock's), of the pre-cognitive Thing evident in Lacanian analysis—the reservoir of the unconscious, source of being, "expressible" only through lurid symbols or actants such as the empty, psychotic gaze of killer Norman Bates or his mummified mother, "personified undead sub ject" as well as "gothic prosopopeia of the inanimate,"37 in the 1960 film Psycho. This is expressly Cohen's take on configuring the work of Bakhtin/Voloshinov (Voloshinov being either a low-key collaborator of the man Bakhtin or an early alias for him) as a rhetoric. Following de Man, who argued that Bakhtin's conceptual edifice of dialogics and heteroglossia was built on fundamental rhetorical tropes (a realization that Bakhtin often resisted himself),38 Cohen pursues the phantasmatic quality in deManian master tropes by which Bakhtin formulates subjectivity. Focal again is the apostrophe/prosopopeia juncture: "For de Man the labor of a figure like prosopopeia (Voloshinov's 'apostrophe') appears less that of a trope to be identified here and there than a technique for preceding representation."39 Prosopopeia, once taken in classical rhetoric as one of many figures of thought, transforms into a quasi-non-form, a para- or proto-linguistic tendency or power that enables repre sentation itself just as it does in the service of Teskey's model of allegory. We can see from Cohen's pronouncements on allegory and prosopopeia that the postmodem trajectory of the philosophy of language parallels closely a more traditionalist project such as Teskey's: the former rereads Benjamin, de Man, Bakhtin, Lacan, and Èizek to demonstrate the limits of language and semiotics in film iconography; the latter traces classical rhetoric and Renaissance poetics along with Nietzsche, Heidegger, and a panoply of current art historians and literary critics to arrive at similar grounds.40 And like Kirby, both Cohen and Teskey raid the larder of rhetorical terms in order to resuscitate, via the use of radical neologisms, fundamental models of consciousness, text, and language in an exhausted age of poststructuralism. (In light of "allelophagy," "corporeography," and "allography," might we need to recalibrate "iconography"? If so, we are brought full circle to Panofsky's still important coinage, "iconology"—a neologistic attempt of his time to maximize the transdisciplinary forces that the great German iconographer suspected would Studies in Iconography 22 — 2001 11</page><page sequence="12">transform his discipline.) For Kirby and Cohen especially, theoretical cognizance of a "prehuman space or gap precedent to any letteration" and of "transmorphed conceptions of the non-human or time" stands as the preeminent responsibility in current theoretical writing.41 Once the human subject and the myth of interiority have been displaced from the philosophical picture (which was poststructuralism's project), the non-human must be ready to fill that space. Still, the championing of radical theorization of the sort proffered by Kirby and Cohen might seem out of place in an iconography journal that depends on archivism and traditional methods of study. I insist on their usefulness to readers of Studies in Iconography owing to Kirby's and Cohen's reanimating of one of ico nography's oldest and most dependable properties—allegorical personification or prosopopeia. Here, again, the direct non-discussion of prosopopeia organizes a still more important document in contemporary art history and iconography—Michael Camille's Mirror in Parchment: The Luttrell Psalter and the Making of Medieval England. This is a book deliberately tuned to medieval topics which cannot avoid, I believe, configuring the important mid-fourteenth-century psalter of Geoffrey Luttrell in terms that resonate with Teskey's, Kirby's, and Cohen's theoretical accounts of an underlying, préfigurai, "prosopopoetic" state of materiality in representation. The link between Cohen's dense and arcane study of life in the age of cultural studies and Camille's breathtaking recent book also involves Bakhtin's dialogical theory. Camille, doubtless, has been the single most important Bakhtinian theorist of medieval visual imagery. His impressive list of big books—The Gothic Idol, Image on the Edge, Master of Death, and Mirror in Parchment—revisit a central thesis: illuminated manuscripts reveal a dialogic relation between the "sacred centers of pages" and the chaotic borders, home to fantastic marginalia, of many a medieval folio.42 Mirror in Parchment presents the most concentrated version of this thesis, while it serves, I believe, as a dialogic response in its own right, a true sequel, to Master of Death f Camille shows how the official mentality of the book's com missioner, wealthy English patron Lord Geoffrey Luttrell, would be at odds with the astonishing array of creatures that Camille calls "babewyns" or "grylli," monstrous hybrids and zoological theriomorphs that crowd the edges of the book's beautiful leaves of parchment. (The conservative Eric Millar, early-twentieth-century author ity on the psalter, often branded such things "nondescripts.") Most important is this fact: the illuminations are not representations of either actual or noetic creatures (that is, creatures called up in the mind). Rather, they might be representations of manufactured objects that Camille demonstrates would have been seen in public spectacles. Following Lucy Freeman Sandler, Camille attends to the covered sutures that join unlikely heads with bodies;44 these no doubt imitate the materially-required 12 Paxson: Prosopopeia and Allegory</page><page sequence="13">features of staged processional figures made of painted leather, cloth, or parchment— monsters, dragons, demons—in craft-sponsored parades and pageants. Yet Camille's central contribution to theorizing the semiotic life of the Luttrell Psalter images comes in his designation that they function most significantly as masks (and his most significant chapter, coming after a couple-hundred pages of diligent and painstaking biographical, historical, and codicological materials, is titled "The Lord's Folk: Masks, Mummers and Monsters"). Considering both Bakhtin's model of carnivalesque spectacle during sacred season and Franz Boas's theories of the "split" image in primitive art, Camille concludes emphatically that "the culture that produced ... the Luttrell Psalter was also one in which making, using and depicting masks was a way of structuring histoiy and subjectivity."45 This I take to be the most theoretically laden if portentous statement in the entire book. Masks (personae, larvae) of painted parchment or leather get manufactured and used at the public level of ritual spectacle; they then find re-presentation on the inked and painted surfaces of parchment pages in sacred texts. Above all, they become the prime cultural markers in the making of subjectivity itself, the process most central and singular to allegorical poetics—the pre-modem technology of subject formation par excellence—without a doubt. Camille's program uncannily parallels the articu lation of a préfigurai category in the formation or invention of subjectivity, discourse, language: prosopopeia, from Greekprosopon poiein—" to make a face or a mask"—serves fourteenth-century English culture as the self-identifying mech anism of subjecthood and universal being itself. But such universality finds con finement to the margins, the borders of sacred pages, indicating a Bakhtinian as well as Lacanian spatial unconscious or preconscious. Camille's loaded theoretical resolutions have centrifugal import for other monuments in fourteenth-century art and poetics. The enigmatic description of Anima in Piers Plowman B, passus 15, takes on new and clarified significance: and in jjat folie I raued Til reson hadde rufje on me and rokked me aslepe, Til I seij, as it sorcerie were, a sotil j&gt;yng wij) alle. Oon wijiouten tonge and teej&gt; tolde me whider I sholde And whereof J cam (B. 15.12-13).46 The emphatic phrase steered by an indefinite pronoun, "one without tongue or teeth," implies other ones who customarily might have or might not have tongues and teeth; and so we might be reminded of the psalter's many tusked and toothy creatures as well as other babewyns or characteristic mask-faces sporting small, empty, hole-like mouths. To be sure, Camille reproduces and discusses Luttrell Studies in Iconography 22 — 2001 13</page><page sequence="14">Psalter images of tongue extractions (fol. 97v, 142) and the toothless St. Apollonia (fol. 59v, 337), to whom the Luttrell Master had emphatically given "a gash of crimson for her lips" to represent "her toothless, chaste mouth."47 But perhaps more important, the winged death's-head on a stick, as Camille designates it (fol. 213r, 343), might be exactly what Langland's Anima is supposed to "look like." It is a mask with a simple hole for its mouth—tongueless and toothless with a vengeance! It is a double prosopopeia: one of Quintilian's personified abstractions so understood in conventional medieval allegory; and a liminal marker of the préfigurai, prosopo poetic conditions which registers the sheer materiality of fourteenth-century cultural practice in large (here, dramatic staging, costume making, limning, manuscript inscription, and the topical reality, reflected in all the little illuminations concerning the peasant's task to transform raw matter into agricultural life and nourishment). The Luttrell Psalter, as Michael Camille shows so well, celebrates prosopopeia as its master though tacitly recognized trope. Camille's favorite or most tellingprosopon from the Luttrell Psalter, in turn, functions for him directly in the Èizekian terms harnessed by Cohen in his pro nouncements on préfigurai prosopopeia: Mirror in Parchment's, penultimate page actually gives its last theoretical word to 2izek, whose modified Lacanian formula of modes of fantasy and repression of the Real buttresses the book's general Bakh tinian slant about the stabilizing versus destabilizing uses of marginal and carnival esque forms in sacred contexts.48 However, Camille's appreciation of the iconically central death's-head prosopopeia—the most significant of allegorical personages in baroque aesthetics for Benjamin49—parallels with equal freight Teskey's lurid materialist language. Camille concludes: Is [the winged death's-head on a stick of fol. 213r] to be seen as a representation of the real, the most terrifying of all the singing mouths in the psalter? Certainly, such a totem like head was visible early in the strife-tom fourteenth century. William Wallace was publicly disembowelled at the Elms in Smithfield in 1305 while a psalter which he always carried was held before his eyes and ... his body was cut into four displayable parts. His head, like that of many traitors, was left to rot on its spike on London Bridge. ... Had such a rotting, skeletal memory of political horror entered the imaginary of the artist and become mixed up with the mumming and masking that seem to be his obses sion, to become just another face among the hundreds of others?50 The "rotting, skeletal memory of political horror" evokes the very image from Renaissance culture that Teskey takes to be main icon of the absolutist despot's Sa turnian, allelophagic power to turn political or historical subjects into allegorical workpieces—that is, into sheer substance "captured" by allegorical due process and rendered into their constitutive matter, i.e., mere meat. (Here indeed stands the 14 Paxson: Prosopopeia and Allegory</page><page sequence="15">demonic version of Kirby's "telling flesh," for it is flesh-as-meat that has been allegorically robbed of speech, as Teskey would affirm.) The instructive narrative for Teskey of this conversion, of course, is Machiavelli's famous segment from The Prince concerning Cesare Borgia's order to have his underboss Remirro de Orca "cut in two pieces" and placed in the market square of Cesena.51 Although Teskey's book represents a strong historicism (he would never attribute to "medieval alle gorical method" the early modern turns that I would), one can't help thinking that the iconography of death, the "inscrutable menace" of tyrants, and the meta physically violent energies of allegorical thought that Teskey accounts for so well had been presaged in the historically remarkable English fourteenth century— though the attribution goes not just for England, since Camille had already painted a Teskeyan picture of Death personified in his closing pronouncements about a hypothetical and fictional "encounter" between that hideous (though "female") allegorical despot and the dying French illuminator Pierre Remiet on the final page of Master of Death.52 The Death of Camille/Remiet/Luttrell Master, Teskey's Saturnian Death, Benjamin's baroque Death, and Cohen's Hitchcockian Mother Death really do seem to be one and the same ontological being, the same rhetorical enfacement. And they resemble very closely Kirby's enfaced, voiced, electric, cellular Flesh or Substance. This essay has proceeded by highlighting the need for increased interdisci plinary consciousness in both literary and iconographical research. Such has, of course, been a trend in cultural studies as well as in iconography; but those pro gressive trends have tended to leave behind in the dust traditional, nuts-and-bolts subjects like allegory and personification. If deManian deconstruction expanded allegory to a universal, at times almost unusable status, New Historicism has flung the term about—along with the catch-all expression "trope" to mean anything from a "theme" to a rhetorical figure—in a way that has anaesthetized it, thereby calling for its terrible diminution in, or even ejection from, theory's main con ceptual repertoire. The four symptomatic books treated in this essay53 can help revitalize the theorization of allegory and personification in philosophy, literary criticism, and art history owing to their aggressive, direct attention to either allegory's traditional vocabularies or its truly radical meanings in a number of scholarly lexicons. And we may productively think of the joint achievement as the symptom or sign of a decisive turn in fin de siècle culture. In the wake of high theory, with its pre dispositions for deconstruction, Marxism, and feminism, the four books I've been discussing bring the needed language of a new materialism, a more self-aware Studies in Iconography 22 — 2001 15</page><page sequence="16">rhetorical materialism, to a subject that had been too long dominated by idealist vocabularies and sentiments. Although Teskey's book alone directly takes on allegory theory's traditional legacy, the other three also successfully take allegory and personification beyond the status of "modified trope" and to the status of "techne of historial intervention."54 This achievement—probably the single most significant result of Paul de Man's career efforts—can, I think, help keep alive the link between literary and cultural theory and the research of modern iconography and art history.

Although Teskey makes productive use of de Man's theorization on irony and allegory, providing one of the best commentaries on "The Rhetoric of Temporality" that I've encountered (59-60), he also marches in step with English studies and art history by maximizing likewise the efforts of important scholars on literary or artistic allegory.

Whereas Master of Death: The Lifeless Art of Pierre Remiet, Illuminator (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996) could be said to be Camille's poetics of the death industry in fourteenth century French culture and art, Mirror in Parchment, though tapping the semiotics of death and privation evident in that semi-fictional study of Pierre Remiet's life (see my essay's antepenultimate paragraph below for direct appraisal of Remiet's "Teskeyan" figure Death), serves to celebrate the agricultural process of life on the English manor. Camille can't resist giving pride of place to a death's head in his last illustration; but his favorite image is an obscene gryllus (illus. 35 from fol. 62v), which images sexuality, social freedom, and even ethnic issues (see 336-39). The Luttrell Psalter can be thought of as a sacred iconography of the substances that give and produce life; plenitude, less so privation, is its phenomenological icon. But then again, we're splitting hairs: the compost heap of Mount Olympus nourishes the farmer's fields. 44. Camille, Mirror in Parchment, 246.

Ibid., 349.1 should add that Camille's project does not often pursue theoretical materials aggres sively; it rather uses them for convenience. This is even more evident in Master of Death, where, along with the fictional narrative vignettes of Remiet's reconstructed life, Camille does no more than furnish epigrammatic quotes from the likes of Foucault, Lacan, or 2iiek at the headings of his chapters. For a review of Master of Death, see Leslie Abend Callahan, "Three Recent Books on Death in/and the Middle Ages," Studies in Iconography 19 (1998): 211-22. 49. See Benjamin, Origins of German Tragic Drama, 166: "Everything about history that, from the beginning, has been untimely, sorrowful, unsuccessful, is expressed in a face—or rather in a death's head" (my emphasis). 50.

See Master of Death, 247: "Suddenly out of the comer of his eye, as if appearing on the very margins of his consciousness, he saw Death, just as he had pictured her at the end of the great Studies in Iconography 22 — 2001 19</page><page sequence="20">pilgrimage of life. She was no longer wielding the sharp curling scythe but something that looked more like the smooth curved end of a finely cut quill, a pen that could inscribe and delineate anything, drawing him unto her .... Ah, yes, he knew it, she was a painter all along! As she drew him, he felt a marvelous turning over of his faded flesh, remaking what had become as brittle and crackled as old parchment." Camille's fantasy of the dying Remiet's "marginal" Death resembles Teskey's allelo phagic, anagogic, allegorical tyrant—destroyer and (re)maker in one—in uncanny terms. It also fur nishes Cohen's picture of a programmatic prosopopeia as a figure of the (literalized) margins of representation, semiotics, materiality, consciousness, cognition; here is Norman Bates's own crackling, dried-up mother that is both source and tomb of Norman's psychotic quasi-subjectivity. 53.
