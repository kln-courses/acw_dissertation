Relief with iwo ducks, Sorrento, XIth or XIIth century. I. The Dumbarton Oaks Collection. i. RELIEF WITH TWO DUCKS. Sorrento. XIth or XIIth century. Marble H. 19 3/4", W. I6 1 /2" No. 36.51. Purchased from Cassirer. Fig. z. The panel depicts two addorsed ducks within a circle formed by an astragal which, in turn, is squared by four palmettes with pine-cones at their centers. The Dum- barton Oaks panel is one of a group of twelve all having a similar format and the same dimensions; hippogriffs, eagles, and winged horses complete the animal repertory. The panels are now dispersed among the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin (one panel) (W. F. Volbach, Mittel- alterliche Bildwerke aus Italien und Byzanz, 2nd ed., Berlin-Leipzig, 1930, p. 58, no. 6683), the Museo Barracco, Rome, (two panels) (C. Pietrangeli, Museo Barracco di scultura antica, 3rd ed., Rome, 1963, p. 121 f., no. 207-8), and the Museo Correale in Sorrento (eight panels) (M. T. Tozzi, Sculture medioevale dell'antico Duomo di Sorrento, Rome, I93I; A. Quintavalle, "Plutei e frammenti d'ambone nel Museo Correale a Sorrento," Rivista del R. Istituto d'Archeologia e Storia dell'Arte, III, I93I, pp. 160-83). Indentations and projections along the vertical sides of the panels suggest that they were originally fitted into a framework which probably formed the side of an ambo or part of a choir screen. The decorative motifs of the twelve panels are clearly related to both Byzantine and Sassanid textiles, but their distinctive style does not easily find a place within the hazy, and largely undocumented, chronology of southern Italian Romanesque sculpture. Lacking comparative material, the panels have been attributed to either the rebuilding of the cathedral at Sorrento (1024-33) or dated a century later.

RELIEF WITH BIRD, VASE AND FOLIAGE Southern Italy (Apulia?) Marble. Late XIth or early XIIth century. H. 243 /8", W. 17 5/8" No. 36.I9. Purchased from Stora, Paris. Fig. 2 The relief is carved on what appears to be a slice of an Ionic capital turned so that the neck and volutes are vertical rather than horizontal. The original function of the stone is suggested by the rear of the panel on which an incised line defines the shape of each volute. The bird, pecking at foliage, faces a cantharus on which are carved two griffins separated by a chalice. An oenochoe rests beneath the branch supporting the bird's claws. A pendant piece, formerly in the collection of Dr. Kurt Cassirer, was lent to the Warburg Institute in I958. It has the same Ionic format and carved foliage, but the bird is of a dif- ferent species and an amphora is substituted for the oenochoe. 46</page><page sequence="2">The choice of decorative motifs and the sculptor's familiarity with antiquity, as evidenced by the archaeo- logical exactitude of the vase shapes, suggests that the relief was carved in southern Italy during the early years of the revival of interest in sculpture in that region, an era characterized by the crypt capitals in both S. Nicola, Bari and the cathedral at Bitonto, as well as by the episcopal thrones at Canosa, Bari, Monte S. Angelo, Calvi Vecchia, and Montevergine. Moreover, the motif of two griffins facing a chalice occurs in southern Italy and can be seen, for example, on the episcopal throne at Canosa (M. Wackernagel, Die Plastik des XI. und XII. rahrhunderts in Apulien, Leipzig, 1911, pl. Ia), and on an eighth or ninth century Italo-Byzantine transenna, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (J. J. Rorimer, "An Italo-Byzantine Marble Relief," Bulletin of the Metro- politan Museum of Art, 25, 1930, pp. 98-o00). The scallops defining the feathers on the breast, neck, and upper wing of the bird, as well as the straight lines delineating the lower part of the wing, should be compared to the pea- cocks on a crypt capital in S. Nicola, Bari (F. Schettini, La Basilica di San Nicola di Bari, Bari, I967, fig. 69). The carving may also be compared to the base of a font decorated with the Evangelist symbols attributable to the late eleventh century in the Duomo at Capua.

The crowning of Roger II on Christmas Day, I I30 officially created the Norman kingdom of Sicily and, with it, the Norman monarchy. Basing his operations in Palermo and Cefal'i, Roger II, while seeking to avoid conflict with the Comnenian dynasty in the East, con- tinued his seemingly incessant struggle with the papacy. The grandeur of the early Norman empire is witnessed by the magnificient cathedrals of Palermo and CefalU. But, for Roger II, art was not only an enhancement, but also an instrument for the propagation of his governmental policies. This union of art and politics brought forth a vital interest in the monuments and materials of ancient Rome. The creation of a large number of porphyry objects, based on antique models, was one aspect of the Norman predilection for things Roman. For, the Egyptian por- phyry quarries were closed after the Arab conquest and Rome, having acquired booty in prior expeditions, became the prime supplier of porphyry throughout the Middle Ages. Roger II, who well knew the significance of the imperial and ecclesiastical display of porphry in both East and West, used it lavishly in attempting to compete with the papal powers. Employing the Pierleone family as agents, Roger obtained porphyry, knowledge of antique FIGURE 2.

(For a thorough discussion of the use, significance, and sources of porphyry cf. R. Delbrueck, Antike Porphyrwerke, Berlin-Leipzig, I932, passim; and, J. Deer, The Dynastic Porphyry Tombs of the Norman Period in Sicily, (Dum- barton Oaks Studies V), Harvard University Press, I959, pp. I 7-65). a. LION HEAD. Palermo.

The two lion heads, modelled on the pair of lions formerly in front of the Pantheon and now in the Museo Egiziano in the Vatican (Deer, op. cit., p. io6f), are particularly notable for their anthropomorphic style. The holes in the mouths, probably denoting water spouts, were carved at a later date and doubtless caused the cracks beginning at the mouths and continuing toward the backs of the heads (Ibid., p. II2). A consideration of the style, which is closely related to the tomb of Henry VI in the cathedral of Palermo, and the subject matter of the heads led Deer to suggest that the lions originally decorated a royal throne, possibly that of Roger II (Ibid., p. 116). FIGURE 4. Lion head. Palermo, second quarter of the XIIth century. 48</page><page sequence="4">The two masks, based on antique sarcophagi, are striking characterizations of a youth and a rather rotund older man. The former is best compared with the head of a supporting figure on the marble base of the sarcophagus of Roger II (Ibid., fig. 76) and the latter with a mask on the north side of Frederick II's sarcophagus (Ibid., fig. 80). Indeed, since the Dumbarton Oaks masks have the same dimensions as the masks on the aedicula of Frederick II's tomb, they, too, may have come from a no longer extant tomb canopy. The Norman tombs to which the lion heads and masks are stylistically related all follow the same general format: a trough supported by lions, human figures, or curved, fluted legs and surmounted by a canopy borne upon columns. The tombs of Frederick II and Henry VI, key monuments in any proposed chronology of South Italian Romanesque sculpture, have been dated as early as the years shortly before 1145 (Ibid., passim.) and as late as the first (L. Cochetti Pratesi, "In margine ad alcuni recenti studi sulla scultura medievale nell'Italia merid- ionale: I," Commentari, XVI, 1965, pp. I86-203) or the FIGURE 5. Mask of an old man. Palermo, second quarter of the XIIth century. second half of the thirteenth century (S. Bottari, "La Tomba di Federico II," Commentari, II, I95I, pp. 62-68). Deer, after a rigorous study of the documents, has con- vincingly argued that the two porphyry tombs given to Cefalu by Roger II in the donation charter of April, I I45 are the tombs in which the remains of Frederick II and Henry VI now rest; the tombs were thus probably made shortly before 1145. Otto Demus (Kunstchronik, 13, I960, pp. II-I9) concurs with Deer. Although Roger II originally expressed a desire to be buried in Cefalu, he was entombed in another sarcophagus in Palermo. e.

Deer (op. cit., pp. 167-70) has compared the capital to those still in the outer window arches on the north wall of the Martorana in Palermo. Indeed, he suggests that the Dumbarton Oaks capital comes from that very church and would thus be securely dated between II43, the date of the founding of the Martorana, and 1150, the date of its completion.

A cross, with a rosette at its base, is behind the lamb. The relief is high, FIGURE 8. Paschal Lamb. Burgundy, second quarter of the XIIth century. ten inches at the head, and the carving of the lamb's coat is vigorous, if somewhat stiff. The rectangular solidity of the rear part of the lamb is counteracted by the twisting motion of the forequarters. The Dumbarton Oaks lamb finds its closest parallel in a somewhat more loosely carved lamb in high relief over the tympanum of the main portal of the abbey of Charlieu (F. Thiollier, L'art roman a Charlieu et en Brionnais, Montbrison, I892, pl. I). The Charlieu lamb is not framed but rests against a border of rosettes in beaded, circular frames. The rosette at the foot of the cross on the Dumbarton Oaks relief is closely related to the rosettes on the door jambs at Charlieu. The cross-hatched border also argues convincingly for Burgundy as it appears on the tympanum of the west portal at St.-Julien-de-Jonzy where it forms a mandorla around Christ (A. K. Porter, Romanesque Sculpture of the Pilgrimage Roads, Boston, 1923, Vol. II, pl. II), as well as surrounding a Virgin of undetermined (but certainly Burgundian) provenance now in Roanne. (I am indebted to R. C. Moeller III for this comparison). For the stylistic character of this group of monuments and its connections, cf. most recently W. Sauerlander, "Eine trauernde Maria des 2. Jahrhunderts aus dem Mittleren Rhonetal," Berliner Museen. Berichte aus den Staatlichen Museen der Stiftung Preussicher Kulturbesitz, xiv, I964, pp. 2-8. 5o</page><page sequence="6">FIGURE IO. Cloister or triforium capital. Southern Italy, Apulia (?), middle of the XIIth century. FIGURE 9. St. Michael. Burgundy (?), middle of the XIIth century. 5. ST. MICHAEL. Burgundy (?) Middle of the XIIth century. Limestone. H. 38 3 /8" No. 36.21. Purchased from Arnold Seligman, Paris, 1936. Fig. 9. This problematic statue which carries Seligman's fanciful attribution to Saint-Maur-des-Fosses, is broken into four parts: the lower half, including the supporting column; the upper part of the column with attached wings; a narrow segment comprising the waist; and, the upper part of the body and the head. Although the entire statue is carved from the same kind of limestone, a type common throughout France and the Mediterranean basin, at least the upper half is patently a modern forgery. The clumsy right hand and arm, the inorganic surface carving on the bodice, the over-refined physiognomy, and limp, massed hair are tell-tale signs suggesting a post-medieval hand. The slightly elongated lower half of the St. Michael is less subject to doubt. The supporting left leg is obscured by heavy drapery. Below the right knee, a series of catenary loops sweep upward and are met by a series of equally spaced, parallel, downward curving folds defining the upper leg and thigh. The latter motif is found in Burgundy as seen, for example, on the tympanum of the north portal at La Charite-sur-Loire (Porter, op. cit., Vol. II, pl. I20). The closest comparison to the St. Michael drapery pattern is the figure of Bathsheba on a nave capital at Vezelay (Ibid., Vol. II, pl. 44); here, a series of downward curving folds meets the catenaries and the knee is defined only by the unarticulated space left at the juncture of the two series of folds. The small size of the St. Michael, scarcely over three feet, suggests that it may have been part of a cloister or possibly have decorated the front of a chapter house, such as the one at Saint-Georges-de-Boscherville (Art Bulletin, 46, I964, fig. 5, opp. p. 70). II. The Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore. I. CLOISTER OR TRIFORIUM CAPITAL. Southern Italy, Apulia (?) Middle of the XIIth century. Marble H. 12 1/4", W. 17 3 /4", D. 5 1 /2" No. 27.567. Bequest of Mrs. Breckenridge Long, I959. Fig. Io. One face of the capital consists of two lions, each of which grasps one of the horns of a centrally placed bull; the other face has a similar motif, save that the animal head in the center lacks the large horns of a bull and has a protruding snout. It is perhaps meant to represent a cow. The ends of the capital are thus formed by a pair of lions each of whom leans away from the horns (or ears) it is grasping on either side of the capital. The lions' heads point outward and their tails are wrapped around their bodies so that the ends are contiguous. The upper border is dentilated and the neck of the capital is deco- rated with circles each of which has an inner motif com- posed of four semicircular segments forming a diamond which, in turn, is centered by a small circle in protruding relief. Capitals of similar type, though with different motifs, may be found in Apulia at the cloister of S. Benedetto in 5I</page><page sequence="7">Brindisi (late XIth century) (C. A. Willemsen and D. Odenthal, Apulia, New York, 1959, fig. 217) and in the exterior triforium arcade of the south nave of the cathedral at Bitonto (first half of the XIIIth century) (A. Petrucci, Cattedrali di Puglia, 2nd ed., Rome, I964, fig. I40). The lion heads are very similar to the decorative reliefs on the side panels of the episcopal throne at Canosa (H. Torp, "Monumentum Resurrectionis: Studio sulla forma e sul significato del candelabro per il cero pasquale in Santa Maria della Pieta di Cori," Acta ad Archaeologiam, I, 1962, pl. VId). The Walters capital is less linear and patterned than the S. Benedetto cloister capitals, but more contained within its block than the Bitonto arcade capitals. It most likely falls in the mid-twelfth century. Bibliography: Art of the Romanesque, University of Notre Dame, Festival of the Arts, 1960, No. 37. 2. DECORATIVE RELIEF. Southern Italy, Apulia (?) Early XIIth century. Marble H. 34", W. I 3 /6", D. 5 3 /6" No. 27.249. Purchasedfrom Brummer (?), i925. Fig. l. The upper part of the relief is occupied by an eagle whose outstretched wings span the width of the slab and whose claws rest upon the top of a sinuous floral and vine motif, the leafy base of which fills the lower part of the relief. Three birds are perched amidst .the foliage. The outer border, with the exception of the space occupied by the eagle's wings, is formed by an unusual twisted rope motif. The lower section is broken off and incorrectly replaced. It is purplish under ultra-violet light, but this may be due to over-cleaning. _ FIGURE ii. Decorative relief. Southern Italy, Apulia (?), early XIIth century. FIGURE 12. Column with Cosmatesque inlay. Central Italy, late XIIth or early XIIIth century. The original function as well as the provenance of the Walters relief are unknown. The fact that the enclosing rope motif appears at both the top and the bottom of the motif suggests that it is a complete rather than a frag- mentary piece, in which case it is certainly too short to have flanked the entire height of a portal as seen, for example, at S. Nicola, Bari. It is even more unlikely that such a relief would have been incorporated into a piece of ecclesiastical furniture. The smoothly finished back of the relief casts further doubt upon its original function. The relief is related to some aspects of South Italian art, most particularly late eleventh and twelfth century Apulia. For example, similar eagles appear on the bishop's throne in the cathedral of Canosa (M. Wackernagel, Die Plastik des XI. und XII. Jahrhunderts in Apulien, Leipzig, I91I, pl. Ia); vegetal motifs interwoven with birds appear on the decorative pilasters on the facade of S. Nicola, Bari (Ibid., pl. XXIVa-b). 3. a. COLUMN WITH COSMATESQUE INLAY. Central Italy, late XIIth or early XIIIth century Marble. (Lion has been repaired). H. 433/8" No. 27.38i. Purchasedfrom Brummer. Fig. 12. The base supporting the twisted Cosmatesque column consists of a damaged hexagonal slab on top of which is a 52</page><page sequence="8">smaller, higher hexagon turned so that its sides are not aligned with the lower base. Three faces of the second hexagon are decorated with Cosmatesque inlay; they alternate with marble faces, from one of which the head, front paws, and upper body of a lion project onto the lower, flat hexagon. The other two marble faces are now blank, but their rough, uneven surface suggests that they, too, may once have been decorated with lions or similar figures. The Cosmatesque column is topped by a composite Corinthian-Ionic capital. The side of the capital parallel to the left side of the lion is unfinished and lacks interior definition of the volutes, a rosette between the volutes, and the drill holes on the leaves. The original function of the column with lion base is unclear. The unfinished side of the capital, which is parallel to one of the damaged sides of the low, hexagonal base, suggests that the entire structure may once have been adossed to a choir screen as seen, for example, at Civita Castellana (E. Hutton, The Cosmati, London, I850, pl. 47). But, the hexagonal base and the possible existence of two more projecting lions casts doubt upon this hypothesis. The column is too short to have served as a paschal candelabrum, although lions do support the paschal candelabrum at the Badia di Cava dei Tirreni (Campania, Attraverso l'Italia, n.s. I0, Touring Club Italiano, Milan, 1962, fig. 176). The exact provenance of the column with lion support is also a conundrum. The composite Ionic-Corinthian capital is not common in Italian medieval art. Capitals FIGURE 13. Two Cosmatesque columns. Campania (?), XIIth century. of similar general type, though more elaborate and loosely woven than the Walters example, appear on thirteenth century monuments such as the ciborium in S. Maria in Cosmedin, Rome (G. B. Giovenale, La Basilica di S. Maria in Cosmedin, Rome, 1927, pl. XVII) and supporting the ambo in S. Nicola at Prata d'Ansidonia in the Abruzzi (E. Bertaux, L'art dans l'Italie meridionale, Paris, 1904, pl. XXV). The lion, characterized by its unwieldly (and partially restored) paws and the abbreviated carving of its mane, is not easily identified with any other lion. The lack of secure documentary evidence besetting all aspects of Cosmatesque art forbids a precise date. b. TWO COSMATESQUE COLUMNS. Campania (?) XIIth century. Marble with mosaic inlay. Columns: H. 50 5/8". Capitals: H. 9 3/4" Nos. 27. 379 A. B, C and 27.380 A, B, C. Purchased in I925. Fig. 13. Each column with its capital was purchased as a unit, but it is evident that the capitals do not fit the columns. Both bases are modern. The columns, inlaid with small bits of mosaic in spiral bands, are unusual in that their diameters are virtually equal throughout their entire length; nor- mally, Cosmatesque columns are twisted so that some of the bands bulge outward (cf. the previous entry). To my knowledge, the only other examples of straight, inlaid columns are the two supporting the front of the ambo in La Badia di Cava dei Tirreni and the adjacent paschal candelabrum in that church (Campania, op. cit., fig. 176). The Cava dei Tirreni ambo was reconstructed from frag- ments in I880 and visual evidence would seem to indicate that the columns are modern, although perhaps based on antique models. The capitals have flower-like scrolls growing from their bases and spreading diagonally to the corners and vertically about two-thirds the height of the capitals. The circular form of the top of the capitals, between the diagonal scrolls, is filled in by a series of parallel tongue shaped flutings. Comparisons for this unusual type of capital seem to occur only in Campania: a capital from the arch of Frederick II, now in the Museo Campano, Capua and, one of the four capitals supporting the thirteenth century ambo in the cathedral of Teano (A. di Lella, "Un monumento dell'arte neo-campana nella basilica cristiana di Teano," L'Arte, VII, I904, pp. 174-5). The two Campanian capitals differ from the Walters capital in that the shorter, curved foliage appears not only on the vertical axes of the capitals, but is also superimposed upon the longer leaves decorating the diagonal axes. 4. Reliefs with animal motifs were the predominant form of architectural decoration in the Veneto from the late eleventh through the thirteenth century. Of diverse origins and insecure chronology, they have not yet been completely collated and analyzed.

The birds are perched so that they face outwards, but the twist of their severed necks suggests two possible formats for the missing part of the relief: (I) the relief was enclosed by another dentilated border at the right and the peacocks were surmounted by a second set of birds flanking a floral motif as seen on the west facade of S. Marco, Venice (O. Demus, The Church of S. Marco in Venice, Dumbarton Oaks Studies VI, Harvard University Press, I960, pl. 24); or, (2) the two peacocks comprise only the left side of a relief, in which case there would have been two more birds and, perhaps, a floral motif separating the two pairs.

Red marble. H. 29. 7/16" (each). No. 27.433-36. Former collection or dealer unknown. Figs. i8a, b, c, d. The group of two columns and two pilasters is character- ized by the simplicity of the carving. Essentially, each capital consists of two superimposed rows of slightly curved leaves lacking interior definition. The upper leaves, immediately below the square abacus, are separated by unusual bulbous motifs, perhaps meant to represent flowers. The uncommon style of the capitals defies specific comparison, but the slightly curved lower leaves are related to a capital in the campanile of S. Zeno, Verona (E. Arslan, L'architettura romanica veronese, Verona, I939, pl. CXXVII, 2), while the bulbous floral motif is loosely related to the side of a capital from S. Tommaso, Genoa and now in the Museo Agostino in the city (C. Dufour Bozzo, La Diocesi di Genova, Corpus della scultura altomedievale IV, Spoleto, I966, pl. XLVII). The original function of the pilasters and columns is open to speculation. Their small size, only two-and-one- half feet, suggests that they were not structural members, but may, rather, have decorated the base of a tomb or a pontile, such as that in the cathedral of Modena. In any case, the pilasters would have rested against some form of architectural support. c d FIGURES I8a and b. Two pilasters. Northern Italy, first half of the XIIth century. FIGURES i8c and d.

The Last Supper begins to the right of the Washing of the Feet with an apostle seated behind a table and another apostle turning the corner to the right side of the capital where a third seated apostle is now scarcely visible. Remains of leaves with drill-work appear above Christ's back and surrounding the neck of the right side, where a small pine-cone is discernible amidst the damaged foliage. The capital is so severely mutilated that it virtually forbids stylistic comparison. The evidence must, of necessity, rest almost entirely upon the apostle seated behind the table on the face of the capital although, even here, the drapery folds are illegible. Nevertheless, the drill holes forming the collar of the garment are similar to those on the relief of St. Thomas from St. Etienne, Toulouse (P. Mesple, Toulouse. Musee des Augustins. Les sculptures romanes, Paris, 1961, No. 5). The facial planes, general proportions, and the delineation of the eyes, beard, and moustache of the seated apostle should also be compared to the right side of a double capital from St. Paul de Narbonne (Ibid., No. 263). Moreover, the use of drill holes arranged in a line and of pine cones to decorate foliate motifs is common in the area of Tou- louse as seen, for example, at La Daurade (Ibid., No. 78), and St. Sernin (Ibid., No. 226-29). The Walters capital is unusual in that it represents both the Washing of the Feet and the Last Supper. The two subjects do not appear together in earlier versions and their joint illustration begins only in the mid-twelfth century. Other examples appear on the capitals in the cathedral of St. Maurice at Vienne and at Chauriat Peter touching his head to indicate to Christ that he also wishes his head washed (7ohn 13:9) is common in Byzan- tine representations, but occurs for the first time in the West in the Hartker Antiphonary from St. Gall (shortly before I Ioo). Giess further suggests that the depiction of the apostle holding the cloth and attending Christ develops in the eleventh and twelfth century under the influence of liturgical drama. (H.

Daguerre, 1927. Fig. 20. The severely damaged wooden Virgin and Child is now undergoing cleaning and restoration at the Walters. The figure, hollowed out in back, is impassively serene, almost</page><page sequence="12">severe, in her hieratic, self-contained frontality. She clasps the crowned Christ child with both hands and He, too, confronts us directly, so that His head is immediately below that of the Virgin. Although attempts have been made to classify the vast number of wooden Madonnas still extant (cf. Ilene E. Haering, Cult Statues of the Madonna in the Early Middle Ages, Columbia Diss., I960), the style of the Walters madonna does not easily find its place within any par- ticular family group. One of its closest relatives appears to be the cult statue formerly in Saint-Martin-des-Champs, Paris and now in St. Denis. Probably dating from the last years of the twelfth century, the St. Denis statue shares with the Walters Virgin the same narrow pro- portions, the general disposition of the garment over the shoulders, and the same flat pleats forming the head of the garment (M. Vloberg, La Vierge et l'enfant dans l'artfranfais, Paris, I954, p. II 5). More distant relatives of the Walters Madonna include the Madonna from the Ile-de-France, now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (H. Swarzenski, "A Vierge d'Or&amp;e," Bulletin of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, LVIII, I960, pp. 64-82) and a Madonna on loan to the Philadelphia Museum of Art from the Pitcairn Collection (No. I50-I93I. 24). The small number of relevant comparative pieces would thus seem to suggest that the Walters Madonna was perhaps made in the Ile-de-France around the year I200. 8. TWO CAPITALS. Palencia.

Figs. 22a and b. The two capitals, companion pieces, present complex iconographical problems which, despite previous in- vestigations, cannot be totally solved. On a very general level, both capitals appear to be concerned with the administration of justice. No. 27.304 shows two men taking an oath by putting their hands in the mouth of a lion mask. The legend, made famous by the Bocca della Verita on the porch of S. Maria in Cosmedin, Rome, warns that the mask will close upon the hands of those who swear falsely. (For a thorough study of the significance of lion masks, cf. H. Hahnloser, "Urkunden zur Bedeutung des Tiirrings," Festschrift fiir Erich Aleyer, Hamburg, I957, pp. I25-46). The other two faces of the capital are occupied by two men, one of whom is masked, and by two clean-shaven men clasping hands. The face of No. 27.305 shows two warriors engaged in combat. On the left face of the capital, a coiffed female figure holds the hand of a bearded man who appears to be FIGURE 20. Madonna and Child. Ile de France, late XIIth or early XIIIth century. FIGURE 2Ia. Capital. Palencia, late XIIth century. (front) 57</page><page sequence="13">FIGURE 2Ib. Capital. Palencia, late XIIth century (side) gesturing toward the warriors. The right face of the capital is occupied by a male figure of uncertain identity; the garments suggest a deacon. The subject matter of the capital cannot be exactly identified. As has been previously pointed out, it certainly falls within the realm of combats which undertake to prove or disprove the virtue of a woman accused of adultery. This type of literature was exceedingly popular in Spain and is re- flected in the Cantigas of Alfonso X of Castile (il Sabio) (I22I-84), the Libro de Buen Amor of Juan Ruiz, and the renowned play Celestina. The seventh Cantiga of Alfonso X, for example, relates the tale of the unchaste abbess; it is elaborately illustrated in the Escorial manuscript of the Cantigas (Lib. Real. Biblioteca T.I.I.). The Walters capital appears to have all the necessary elements for this type of narrative. Although the iconography of the Walters capitals presents a problem, their style is comparatively well documented. The figures are characterized by their pro- portionally large heads, hawk-like noses, and bulging eyes. The drapery is thick and its surface is broken by deep gashes indicating folds; a rather soft pattern of concentric circles at the knee seems to be characteristic. The Walters capitals demand comparison with the two large capitals from the monastery of S. Maria de Alabanza in Palencia which are now to be seen at the Fogg Museum. Although the Fogg capitals are somewhat smoother and more elaborate, they observe the same disporportionate relationship of head to body, as well as similar facial configurations and drapery conventions. Fortunately, the Fogg capitals are securely dated by inscription to the FIGURE 22a. Capital. Palencia, late XIIth century (front) year I 185. It is within this period, in the region of Palencia that the Walters capitals were carved. Bibliography: The Walters Art Gallery, Handbook of the Col- lection, Baltimore, I936, p. 63.

Palencia, late XIIth century (side) FIGURE 23. Head of a man. Saint-Gilles, middle of the XIIth century (?) suggested that the head may be more closely related to the fragmentary tympanum from the church of St. Martin, in the same town. Indeed, it would appear that the soft, volumetric, almost classicizing approach, so evident in the Phillips head, is related to both St. Gilles and St. Martin. A particularly close comparison at St. Gilles is the head of St. Michael in the niche to the left of the north portal (R. Hamann, Die Abteikirche von St. Gilles und ihre kiinstler- ische Nachfolge, Berlin, I955, pl. 8). Yet, the Phillips head also bears some similarities to the soft, round physi- ognomies of the St. Martin tympanum. Although it may be said with some confidence that the provenance of the Phillips head is St.-Gilles-du-Gard, its date is totally insecure, for both the abbey church and St. Martin have been the object of much scholarly contro- versy. The fa,ade of St. Gilles is thought to have been carved as early as the first three decades of the twelfth century (Hamann, op. cit.) and as late as the third quarter of that century (M. Gouron, "Saint-Gilles-du-Gard," Congre's archeologique, io8, I95I, pp. I04-II9; R. de Lasteyrie, "Etudes sur la sculpture fran$aise au moyen age," Fondation Eugene Piot. Monuments et memoires, VIII, I9o02, pp. 8o-II5). Meyer Schapiro, on the other hand, has suggested the thirties and forties of the twelfth century ("New Documents on St. Gilles," Art Bulletin, 17, I935, PP. 415-30). The same sort of chronological confusion surrounds the St. Martin tympanum fragment. Gouron, the first to publish it, suggests the years II83-90 ("Decouverte du tympan de l'eglise Saint-Martin a Saint-Gilles," Annales du Midi, LXII, I950, pp. II5-I20), while Hamann favors a date around II52 (op. cit., pp. 25 I-54). Gouron's proposed date, unbolstered by secure documentary evidence, appears somewhat late. It is evident that a secure date for the Phillips head cannot be offered until the various ateliers working in St.-Gilles-du-Gard can be sorted out and a more rigorous chronology established.
