<plain_text><page sequence="1">OIKOS 2:1 1950 THE CHOICE OF PREY AND MODES OF HUNTING OF PREDATORY BIRDS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THEIR SELECTIVE EFFECT BY GUSTAF RUDEBECK (Zoological Institute, Lund.) The literature on the food of the North-European birds of prey is at present fairly extensive. Among older works should be mentioned RORIG, 1909, among more recent publications GROEBBELS, 1932, and especially UTTENDORFER, 1930, 1931, and 1939. FERDINAND (1923) has made a contribution from Denmark, and HAGEN (1948) has lately published an investigation from Norway. In recent years fairly comprehensive studies of the hunting methods of predatory birds have also been made in connection with the increased interest in ecological questions. TINBERGEN (1946) has thus described the hunting methods and choice of prey of the sparrow-hawk (Accipiter nisus) at some length. He has also investigated the significance of this bird as a mortality factor (regulator) for certain species of small birds. - Good descriptions of the modes of hunting of birds of prey are also found in many modern ornitho- logical handbooks (NIETHAMMER, 1938; TuCKER in WITHERBY et al., 1945; ROSENBERG in HOLMSTROM et al., 1944, among others). Much remains, however, to be done in this field. Only very few species have been subjected to close investigation, and I am firmly convinced that thorough observations, cor- rectly interpreted, of the behaviour of living animals will always yield valuable results even when zoological science has become more advanced than it is today. Present day research on population dynamics carried out so intensively (see, for example, ELTON, 1942 and KALELA, 1949), obviously has points in common with the investigations on the selection of prey of predatory birds. LACK (1946) has discussed the competition among various species of birds of prey for food. Finally, some authors have directly studied the question of "the relationship between predator and prey", for instance BODENHEIMER, 1938, OMER-COOPER, 1948, and others. It would be very easy to enlarge the list of publications which, like those 5 - Oikos</page><page sequence="2">66 Gustaf Rudebeck cited above, treat the relationship between predator and prey from a quantitative point of view. If, as in this paper, we instead lay the main stress on the qualitative point of view and seek a possible selective effect of the choice of prey of predatory birds, the literature on that subject is comparatively sparse. The question could hardly be raised at all until the doctrine of evolution had been accepted and the struggle for existence and selection were introduced as explanations of the development. Nor could an answer to the question be expected until a thorough investigation of the ecology of both predators and their prey had been made, and particularly of the mutual ecological relationships between these two groups of animals. During the last fifty years the problem has been treated with interest in many different connections, but the lack of applicable primary material seems to have been universal and is largely responsible for the limited debate on this subject. Formulation of the problem The question of whether the choice of prey of predatory birds has a selective effect can also be expressed as follows: Are the individuals selected by predatory birds chosen at random from the population? In other words: when a bird of prey attacks a certain quarry, why is that particular in- dividual pursued and killed? Did it possess any special quality in which it differed from other members of its own kind? If so, what was that quality? Thus, the problem is not which speci e s of animals serve as food to the various birds of prey, but which individuals that are killed. The qualitative viewpoint and not the quantitative one should be emphasized, although these two sides of the matter are not completely independent of each other (cf. the selective effect in populations of various size, WRIGHT, 1931, 1940). The answers to the questions formulated cannot be obtained from analyses of remains of the quarry, pellets, and the like, at least not by such methods alone. We must also have a great number of observations on the hunting of predatory birds, not only their modes of hunting but also the percentage of successful hunts, the normal reactions of the various species to predators, the behaviour of the chased animals, possible deviations in some respect or other from normal behaviour, etc. Of particular interest is the question whether the specimens which are abnormal in any respect fall a victim to predatory birds comparatively often. Accidental occurrences and false deductions due to insufficient material must be avoided. Since individual specimens of birds of prey may specialize on a certain quarry (prey) or mode of hunting (NIETHAMMER, 1938; UTTENDORFER, 1939; TINBERGEN, 1946; my own observations) it is desirable that observations are gathered from as many</page><page sequence="3">The choice of prey and modes of hunting of predatory birds 67 specimens of hunting birds as possible. The investigations, therefore, cannot be based solely on a study of a few pairs of breeding birds of prey. If any conclusions are to be drawn, the hunting of the bird of prey must be followed closely, preferably from the beginning to the end, and the behaviour of both predator and prey must be studied and noted. Extremely divergent opinions are known to have been advanced as to the function of the bird of prey in nature. Man's primitive hostile attitude towards these animals still survives in wide circles, not only among primitive people but also among hunters who belong to the so-called civilized peoples. This attitude is, of course, very interesting from many points of view but has very little to do with scientific research and will therefore not be discussed here. The question has been treated previously in another con- nection (RUDEBECK, 1949). * The discussion of the selective effect of birds of prey started in the decades when the idea of their "destructiveness" was most deeply rooted and the birds were pursued with frantic energy. It is interesting to review the arguments presented against the ruling opinion in the beginning of the twentieth century. OBERLANDER (1907), for example, considers that the extirpation of predators had disastrous effects on wild game. He says inter alia: "Sick or crippled birds are of far more interest to predators than healthy animals. If a goshawk or peregrine falcon swoops down upon a flock of game birds, one of which is crippled, the latter is taken first. I have observed this to happen so often that there can be no question of coincidence. Predatory birds know from experience that a sick bird is their easiest prey and they notice the sick animals at once from their movements, carriage, and ruffled feathers." (Orig. German.) SCHAFER (1938) who evidently had a wide experience from the field, says of the Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus barbatus): "Kranke Herdentiere kann er mit Sicherheit von gesunden Stiicken unterscheiden". The same author gives also several examples on how specimens of Aquila rapax with extraordinary swiftness attack and seize wounded birds which are just falling down. In his opinion this is "another proof that the large raptorial birds immediately and infallibly attack and kill sick game, while healthy animals usually escape". DURANGO (1948) on three occasions has seen sparrow-hawks (Accipiter nisus) seize, out of large flocks of small birds, the particular specimen that he knew was physically defective. He draws the conclusion that this cannot be mere coincidence.</page><page sequence="4">68 Gustaf Rudebeck KRAMER, one of UTTENDORFER'S co-workers (see UTTENDORFER, 1931) was able to demonstrate that the racing pigeons that had fallen victims to peregrine falcons, largely consisted of stray individuals. UTTENDORFER sur- mises, probably quite correctly, that such specimens are particularly easy to catch. BRINKMANN (1923, 1927) has maintained with acerbity and exhaustive argumentation the significance of predatory birds as "sanitary police". He discusses the question in connection with his wellknown studies of coccidiosis in willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus) in Norway. He argues as follows (1927, p. 47-49): "It is justifiable to assume that a predatory bird seeks its prey where it is most easily taken. Birds of prey do not hunt for sport. Since we know that sick grouse do not take cover or fly very far, it is legitimate to conclude that birds of prey prefer to seize sick animals. They will thereby have a sanitary effect on the stock." This theory is strongly supported by I. B. BARTH (1.894) who is quoted by BRINKMANN. BARTH says he has observed on many occasions that gyrfalcons and peregrine falcons notice at once if there is a crippled individual among frightened grouse; this specimen is then always selected. BRINKMANN's account (1. c. p. 62-63) of the consequences of the *energetic persecution of birds of prey is very interesting: "The result of the decim- ation of birds of prey was a perfectly enormous increase in the stock of willow grouse, which culminated in 1911. It was then larger than it had ever been before. But as no attempt had been made to preserve the. stock by having game keepers to collect sick and dead game and to cleanse ... infected areas ..., the result was a complete collapse of the stock, which became the prey of a violent epizootic (coccidiosis), which, because the coveys in the large stock lay very close together in the summer, had quite exceptionally favourable conditions for development. The epizootic has continued year after year with small deviations, and it is obvious that it was not checked until the stock was very much reduced. The coveys then lay so far apart during the breeding season that the danger of infection was reduced considerably thereby." An essential contribution to the question of selection is also LORENZ' highly interesting and astute treatise "Die angeborenen Formen moglicher Erfah- rung" (1943). LORENZ discusses at some length the consequences of domestic- ation for domestic animals and stresses strongly the degeneration, both psychic and physical, which results when a species through domestication is withdrawn from the effects of natural selection. LORENZ worked with wild and tame specimens of several species including the greylag (Anser anser (L)). These two stocks showed very great differences in survival capacity when placed in the same environment. The figures may</page><page sequence="5">The choice of prey and modes of hunting of predatory birds 69 be quoted: During the winter of 1939-40 the author had in his research station 41 greylags, of which 27 were of pure wild stock and 14 cross-breeds between wild and tame birds. "Als nun die Ganse durch voriibergehenden Futtermangel, Zufrieren des Teiches und den Einbruch von FUchsen ge- zwungen wurden, fortzuziehen und kurze Zeit das Leben wilder Grauglinse zu fiihren, verloren die Reinbliter (= the wild stock) nur 5 Vogel, alles dies- jahrige unerfahrene Junge ..., wahrend von den Mischbluttern (= the cross production between wild and tame birds) 8 Tiere zugrunde gingen." In other words, the mortality rate for wild birds was 18.5 and for tame birds 57. LORENZ concludes that "die Wildform gegen die feindlichen Einwirkungen der ausserartgenossischen Umwelt umr ein Vielfaches widerstandsfahiger ist als das stumpfsinnige, mit Ausnahme von Fressen und Begattung in allen seinen Verhaltensweisen reaktions~schwache Haustier". When the animals were kept enclosed and breeding was free the tame greylags and the progeny of tame X wild birds increased much more rapidly than the pure wild stock. The conclusion is naturally that the tame greylags are "unendlich viel durch- schlagskraftiger als die Wildform, wenn nicht dussere Umwelteinfhisse, sondern die Raumkonkurrenz der Artgenossen der einzige zu tberwindende, die Yermehrung hindernde Faktor ist. Im Stalleben kommt es eben nicht darauf an, feinsinnig den Feind auf grosse Entfernung wahrzunehmen, seine Kinder mutig zu beschtitzen oder einen Gatten zu wahlen, der diese Reak- tionen in vollem Ausmass besitzt, ;sondern ausschliesslich darauf, mit mog- lichst grossem Appetit und moglichst geringer Selektivitat wahllols und masslos zu freshen und zu zeugen! Deshalb entwickeln begreiflicherweise alle jene Verfallserscheinungen, die eine derartige Vereinfachung und 'Ver- rohung' des arteigenen Verhaltens bewirken, unter den Bedingungen des Haustierlebens einen stark positiven Auslesewert." In summarizing one might say that many zoologists and geneticists are inclined to believe in the selective effect of predatory birds although they cannot often. substantiate their opinion. Many authors (e. g. WESENBERG-LUND 1929, JAGERSKIOLD 19405) do not even try to confirm their views. Even the examples given above show the weak points in the argument. Those who have studied the predators in the field have generally not made any detailed records but have given general impressions and rules without being able to confirm them. LORENZ is one of the few who have published quantitative studies, but of course he could not report the causes of death in the various flocks of greylags. BRINKMANN'S investigation is undoubtedly important but his views on the part played by predatory birds were largely based on indirect evidence and some bird-watchers quoted by him were, for various reasons, unreliable. Another weak point is that the various species of birds of prey are generally treated as a group instead of individually.</page><page sequence="6">70 Gustaf Rudebeck It also appears as if in recent years a more sceptical attitude towards the selective effect of predators has gained ground among geneticists and research workers on game. This is probably due partly to theoretical reflect- ions on other causes of death in the stocks of game, chiefly the competition within the same species, and perhaps partly to the difficulties encountered in proving the other point of view. SVARDSON'S comprehensive paper (1949) is a good example of this more sceptical attitude. The influence of predators on game stocks has naturally been a common subject of discussion in game literature. The problem, if visualized clearly, has usually been formulated as follows: Do predatory birds preferably seize sick, injured or in other ways inferior game? Do birds of prey, in other words, serve as a kind of "sanitary police" for the game? In Swedish game literature these questions are often treated with open irony, which must be considered as hardly an adequate position, particularly in consideration of the standard of knowledge of the writers. Among sportsmen the answer is most often negative. In another connection (RUDEBECK, 1949) I have discussed briefly the attitude of recent Swedish game literature towards the problem of predators. The main impression is that little new has been added from this quarter and that biased views, lack of objectivity, and lack of desire for objective treatment still flourish there. In recent years, however, several positive con- tributions have been published. The modern Svenskt Jaktlexikon [- Swedish Hunting Dictionary] (19147) shows remarkably often an evident unwilling- ness to make a declaration in the heated discussion concerning predators. It is quite objective with regard to some species; towards others, however, the old bitter attitude still exists and in order to justify this attitude even obviously misleading data are submitted, as in the case of the goshawk. Concerning some species of raptorial birds, it is "left to the individual hunter to decide whether he wishes to permit them on his grounds". The attitude of the sportsmen towards pertinent problems, as well, as the game research which is carried out under the direction of the hunting clubs, seems to be in a period of transition. Finally, a few words about the attitude of the conservationists towards these questions. They have, as a rule, defended predatory animals, believing them to have a beneficial effect, even from the stand-point of game pre- servation. Their main argument has been based on the classic Darwinian conception of "the survival of the fittest". The weak point of this reasoning is the lack of direct evidence due to insufficient observations. In my view, the opinion that no animal species should be outlawed, which ins maintained by those interested in the protection of all organisms, should be treated with great respect. For purely scientific reasons, every animal species is of interest,</page><page sequence="7">The choice of prey and modes of hunting of predatory birds 71 whether it is considered useful, injurious, or indifferent. It is utterly in- excusable simply to condemn any one animal species or - at best - to do so on the basis of our extremely imperfect knowledge of the gynecology of the animals concerned. In so doing we greatly overestimate our present level of knowledge. My own observations. When LOWE in 1940 formed the question: "How do larger raptorial birds hunt their prey?", MEINERTZHAGEN (1940) made the following comment: "Mr Willoughby Lowe ... has raised a question about which very little is known, mainly because no single person has been fortunate enough to witness more than a few instances". This fact probably explains why a large number of observations on the hunts of birds of prey have never been collected or, at least to my knowledge, never been published. I have, therefore, thought it justifiable to publish my own observations on this subject. They were col- lected and taken down during comprehensive ornithological field studies in southern Sweden during the period of 1935 to 1947; some notes date still further back. The observations from earlier years are, however, sparse and the annotations incomplete, particularly regarding unsuccessful hunts of predatory birds. Most observations - as well as the most thoroughly annotated ones - are for the years 1942-1945, when I resided in Falsterbo in the southwestern part of Sweden, about 550 23' N and 120 48' E, to study the autumn migration of birds. Field observations were also carried out in 1946 and 1947, at various places in Scania and Blekinge, and Ottenby on the southern point of Oland [where the bird observatory of the Ornithological Society of Sweden is located]. It should be pointed out that large numbers of migrating birds pass over southern Sweden every autumn, flying in a south-westerly direction. For bird migration at Ottenby, Oland, see SVARDSON 1948, 1949, 1950. In SkAne [Scanial, especially at FaIsterbo, the migrating birds are still more numerous, the most prominent groups being Corvidae, starling, finches, woodlaxks, pipits, wagtails, pigeons, and birds of prey. The very marked concentration of migrating birds in Falsterbo in autumn is due to the form of the coast line where guiding lines converge towards Falsterbo [for the idea of guiding lines, see GEYR VON SCOWEPPENBURG 1929, 1933, 1936; for the autumn migration at Falsterbo, see VEDEL TANING 1931, RUDEBECK 1943, 1947, and 1950 (in press)]. I am fully aware that my observations are by no means perfect. They have, for instance, been made chiefly in Scania during autumn and winter. It would naturally be desirable to study the birds also in another environ-</page><page sequence="8">72 Gustaf Rudebeck ment and during other parts of the year, particularly in the breeding season. The area, however, had distinct advantages, and the observations collected have their merits, too. In many respects it is advisable to study the feeding habits of predatory birds during the autumnal migration. At that time of the year the supply of prey is largest; this is particularly true of the inexperienced young birds. It is evident from the ring-markings that the juvenile birds show a strikingly high mortality. One might therefore safely assume that predatory birds find it particularly easy to catch their prey during the autumnal migration. It should be kept in mind, however, that yearlings among the predators are also inexperienced and exposed to very great perils during their first year. As mentioned before, many predatory birds specialize on a certain sort of prey, *either because this quarry is especially abundant or because the individual bird has learned a particular mode of hunting which it has tried with success on one or more species of birds. The prey must naturally occur in a certain minimal frequency in order to become "favorised prey". One might therefore introduce a great source of error if only a small number of breeding pairs of predatory birds are studied. This source of error is avoided in observations of predatory birds on migration. Most specimens of predators, whose hunting methods and choice of prey I have investigated, have been migrants. I have only seen them hunt once or twice, and the next time both the bird of prey and its quarry have been new. In other words: from this point of view the material can be regarded as samples taken from an enormous population, which naturally is a great advantage. The species examined Since every animal species has its own ecological requirements the modes of hunting and the selective effect, if there is one, must obviously be examined for every species separately. For several species of predatory birds, however, I do not possess a sufficient number of observations. Only in the case of four species is the material large enough to give significant results. The discussion will, there- fore, only deal with these four species, namely: Sparrow-hawk Accipiter nisus (L.) Merlin Falco columbarius L. Peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus TUNST. Sea-eagle Haliaeetus albicilla (L.) The three genera represent entirely different types of predatory birds. Even the two species of the genus Falco are not very closely related, be-</page><page sequence="9">The choice of prey and modes of hunting of predatory birds 73 longing to different sub-genera and showing great differences in structure, size, and manner of living; they resemble each other in so far as they both prey mainly upon birds in flight. All four species of predatory birds discussed in this paper have a very wide distribution (PETERS, 1931). Accipiter nisus occurs in the greater part of the palaearctic region, extending in winter into the adjacent southern regions. The species is divided into a number of subspecies: PETERS recog- nizes 10 forms, NIETHAMMER and WITHERBY only 6. In Sweden only Accipiter nisus nisus breeds; it occurs throughout most of the country. - The 'sparrow- hawks which occur as passage-migrants in southern Sweden and undoubtedly breed in Finland and North Scandinavia, also belong exclusively to the nominate form, as far as is known (FPrteckning 6ver Sveriges faglar 1949). Very closely related species exist in North and Central America. Falco columbarius is a circumpolar and north-palaearctic species, breeding also in the arctic regions. It is a migratory bird and can be seen in winter as far south as the Caucasus, India, and Central America. Of its approxim- ately 11 recognized forms only one occurs in Sweden, viz., Falco' columbarius aesalon TUNSTALL; it breeds mainly in the northern and middle parts of the country (Forteckning over Sveriiges faglar 1949). Falco peregrinus is practically cosmopolitan, breeding in all continents. Its geographical variation is considerable: PETERS recognizes 16 subspecies in all. As a rule (HARTERT, 1912-21; PETERS, 1931; SCHIOLER, 1931; STEIN- BACHER in HARTERT-STEINBACHER 1932-1938; WITHERBY et al., 1945) the entire population of northern Europe is considered to belong to the nominate form, Falco peregrinus peregrinus TUNSTALL. The FDirteckning over Sveriges fAglar (1949) mentions only this form for Sweden. Some authors, however, recognize slightly different subspecies in Great Britain, Germany, and Scandinavia (KLEINSCHMIDT 1913, 1916, and see discussion in HARTERT-STEINBACHER 1. C.). Haliaeetus albicilla, finally, is widely distributed in the palaearctic region and breeds also in the arctic zone. It has not been able to adapt itself to civilization to the same degree as the other three species mentioned, and has recently been exterminated by man in many countries and has become very rare in other countries, among them Sweden. The sea-eagle shows only slight geographic variation. SCHIOLER (1931) considered it possible to separate a larger form from Greenland, but HARTERT (1912-21, p. 1178) and PETERS (1931) do not recognize any subspecies. The North-American Haiiaeetus leucocephalus is very closely related, however, and, according to HARTERT and STEINBACHER (1932-38, p. 422), it can quite naturally be grouped to- ,ether with albicilla in one "Rassenkreis". From the foregoing it is evident that my observations refer to the nominate form except in the case of Falco columbarius aesalon TUNSTALL.</page><page sequence="10">74 Gustaf Rudebeck All four species of predatory birds in question have a very wide breeding area and are in some respects very slightly specialized, viz., they are not restricted to a certain kind of prey. With regard to structure, general ecology, and choice of prey they are very different, but all of them are obviously successful types. The reactions of the predatory bird to its prey and vice versa. Before proceeding to an examination of the various hunting methods and choice of prey of the different species, it is necessary to investigate the manner in which the predatory bird reacts towards its quarry and vice versa. I shall limit my discussion to the reactions between predatory birds and other birds, since most of my observations concern such cases. - Further it is essential to define a few terms concerning the hunting, attacking and search for prey of predatory birds. a) On the sudden appearance of a predatory bird, other birds act in different ways. Those species which are quite out of the question as prey show no fright reaction whatsoever, or if they do, very soon calm down again. On the other hand, birds, for which the predatory bird is a potential danger, naturally try to escape the danger. In doing so they employ very different methods. Various species may behave in almost the same manner but specific reactions are also observed. The behaviour naturally varies with the type of predatory bird concerned, and also with the environment, season, distance to the bird, etc. A flight reaction of some kind is perhaps the most common occurrence. In some cases, however, the birds sit close together and in flying flocks they bunch together (literature and discussion by LORENZ, 1943, pp. 251-255; TINBERGEN, 1939). It is important to establish that the threatened animals usually observe the approaching raptorial bird in time and react in such a way as to make it impossible for the latter to seize a quarry; in most cases the predatory bird does not even make any attempt to attack, simply because it was discovered in time. This is undoubtedly the usual course of events. In suitable localities, where migrating birds concentrate in large numbers and where many birds of prey also pass, it happens so often that one cannot record every instance. If the bird does not hunt any specially selected individual (or flock of game), the case can naturally not be put down as hunting or attempted hunting. b) Frequently a bird of prey is seen in flight, searching for quarry or at least prepared to attack if any quarry should appear. Since the bird is not hunting a certain individual, these cases, therefore, cannot be considered as instances of hunting. We proceed now to the cases when a predatory bird really chases a certain</page><page sequence="11">The choice of prey and modes of hunting of predatory birds 75 quarry or a flock, at least for a short moment. I have not investigated the problem from a psychological point of view, but it may be assumed that the bird of prey attacks when the quarry has a certain position in relation to the bird of prey. Perhaps one can also assume that the attack is released most surely and automatically, i. e., that the "desire to attack is strongest" at the moment when the quarry is in such a position that the chances of successful hunting are maximal. Birds of prey very often turn from migration flight to hunting if a suitable opportunity presents itself. This is particularly true of the sparrow-hawk, merlin, and peregrine falcon, but can also be said of sea-eagles, marsh harriers, and others. Buzzards (Buteo and Pernis), on the other hand, rarely break off their migratory flight in order to hunt, probably because they usually fly at great heights and therefore have few favourable opportunities for hunting. Moreover, the gliding and soaring is very energy-saving, and the most pronounced gliders therefore have only little need of nourishment during migration. c) Birds of prey are sometimes seen to pursue a quarry but to break off the chase before catching up with the potential prey. There may also be only a slight attempt at pursuit: the bird suddenly changes its course and speeds towards the intended quarry but gives up after only a few metres of flight, resuming its original course. Predatory birds, especially sparrow- hawks, can also be observed to "start" when another bird passes close by; there is no pursuit but the short moment of "uncertainty" or "hesitation" indicates that the bird of prey was on the verge of giving way to another impulse. There are other instances when regular hunting takes place but the bird of prey slows down or turns away from the fleeing quarry before the latter comes within reach. I call this behaviour "incompleted attempts at hunting". As the predatory birds never actually tried to seize the quarry, these cases have not been included in the hunts reported below. d) There remains now only those cases which should really be called hunting, viz., when a bird of prey makes one or more completed attempts to kill or seize a specially selected quarry. One hunt may consist of one or several stoops. If the first fails the birds often give up the hunt completely. Often, however, they continue the attempt, in many cases with amazing energy, striking repeatedly and violently, ten to twenty times or more, at the same quarry. After every unsuccessful stoop the raptorial bird is in an unfavourable position in relation to the prey and must therefore regain a good initial position before striking again. When calculating the percentage of successful hunts one might therefore be justified in considering each stoop, each new attack, as a hunt, that is to say, as a new number in the statistics. However, every new stoop in such a prolonged hunt is nearly always directed against the same individual, which has thus never eluded</page><page sequence="12">76 Gustaf Rudebeck the pursuer in spite of its efforts. If a predatory bird thus strikes many times in succession I have counted the whole course as only one hunt. If I have recorded, however, that the bird after one or more unsuccessful stoops began to pursue another quarry, this would be counted as two hunts. Such cases are rare, however, and are of no great consequence for the statistics. e) It struck me very early how often the hunting of a predatory bird failed. For every successful hunt there are 10, 20, even 30 unsuccessful ones. During my earlier years of observations, I did not always note unsuccessful hunts which I witnessed, but all successful ones were naturally recorded. From 1942 this source of error has been greatly reduced. On certain days, how- ever, when the flight of migratory birds has been very heavy, I have not had time to write down all unsuccessful hunts. f) Finally, it should be pointed out that it is not always clear from the wording in my diaries whether a certain bird of prey has been actually hunting or only on the look-out for quarry. Such doubtful cases have not been included in the material submitted below. What has been said on the previous pages, especially in section (e) and (f), shows on statistical treatment of the material the same tendency, i. e., that the percentage of successful hunts is too high. The first source of error can be eliminated if the percentage of successful hunts is calculated only on the observations from the years 1942 to 1947. It is naturally desirable, on the other hand, that all the successful hunts are taken into account in the discussion of the hunting methods of the various species of predatory birds. The treatment of the material, influence of the sources of error, etc., are discussed for each separate species. No attempt has been made in this paper at a detailed mathematical analysis of the material. I am not in a position to judge whether anything essentially new can be obtained through such an analysis. Many factors in the hunting and selection of prey of predatory birds cannot be expressed in figures, however, and a purely biological treatment will therefore always play an important part. Sparrow-hawk (Accipiter nisus (L.)) The sparrow-hawk is largely a short-distance hunter. It is rarely successful in catching a bird flying in open air and is often seen to pass close to migrating flocks of small birds without attempting to chase them. If, how- ever, it should come vyer y close to a small bird in flight, it is always ready to strike, accelerates with lightning swiftness, and displays remarkable skill in manoeuvring. Apparently it prefers to attack birds which are surprised when rising or in other situations when they lack their full freedom of movement.</page><page sequence="13">The choice of prey and modes of hunting of predatory birds 77 Because of the situation of my observation stations I often observed the hunting of the sparrow-hawk in more or less open country. I suspected that my observations were not entirely representative with regard to this species since it is known to have a preference for hunting in woods and copses where it is less readily observed. The percentage of successful hunts might not be the same in woodland as in open country. My apprehensions seem to be unfounded, however. L. TINBERGEN (1946, p. 193-197) has found that the Dutch sparrow-hawks hunt in very varying terrain. During the breeding period they seem to avoid the open fields but "after fledging time their interest seems to be directed to the neighbouring fields as well ... The preference for woods only exists in early spring .. ." The sparrow-hawk is undoubtedly very skilful at taking cover even on open ground. In Falsterbo where I have seen many thousands of sparrow-hawks pass they are often observed "to fly very low,. on a combined hunting and migration flight. They approach with moderate speed, glide smoothly in among the bushes and dense saplings; they even follow the contours of every knoll and have an incredible ability to hide behind the smallest irregularity. They are always prepared to attack" (RUDEBECK, 1947, orig. Swedish). The sparrow- hawks migrating over Scania, the majority of which no doubt consist of Swedish and Finnish breeding birds, are observed to hunt in terrains of very different character. Although they come from very well-wooded countries they show no aversion to hunting in fields and meadows; on the contrary, they are often seen to attack various small birds resting on such ground. Discussion of the observations In my diaries I have records of 190 hunts by sparrow-hawks on non- predatory birds. I have been able to follow these hunts from beginning to end or at least sufficiently to study the hunting method and decide the final result. They gave a total of 23 victims altogether. (See table 1. The tables are placed at the end of the paper.) The fact that many unsuccessful hunts have not been annotated is; especially true of the sparrow-hawk. The percentage of successful hunts is thus considerably lower than indicated by the table. This fact is further discussed below. I have also recorded 23 hunts and completed attacks by sparrow-hawks against other predatory birds (table 2). None of these were successful. I have been in a quandary as to whether to include the attacks against other predatory birds in the hunting statistics or not. It is obvious that birds of prey are only rarely caught by the sparrow-hawk. It is not always easy to decide whether the attack of a predatory bird against large, "inadequate" animals has the character of real hunting or only of mobbing, undertaken</page><page sequence="14">78 Gustaf Rudcbleck for other reasons. A sparrow-hawk that attacks such birds as kites (Milvus) or marsh-harriers (Circus aeruginosus) can hardly be successful! The same is probably the case with crows. I have hesitated to include such "hopeless" cases in the statistics. On the other hand, there is no doubt that a sparrow- hawk c an kill smaller birds of prey, and it is not at all certain that the attacks of the sparrow-hawk against, for instance, kestrels and merlins should be excluded from the discussion. Many species of birds constitute the diet of the sparrow-hawk; some are taken in great numbers, some only to a small extent, and some only exceptionally. Many species are inconceiv- able as prey. The limits between these categories are, however, indistinct, and attacks may evidently occur also against inadequate objects. The latter must react in some way, however, either by flight or counter-attack, other- wise we get examples of atypical prey. For instance: wood-pigeons (Columba palumbus) are not usually attacked by sparrow-hawks - large migrating flocks often pass quite near the sparrow-hawks without being attacked. I have seen this phenomenon many hundreds of times since both species are very easily observed when migrating over Scania. Only once have I observed a sparrow-hawk forcibly attack a wood-pigeon in a small migrating flock. The pigeon reacted remarkably late; it veered aside at the very last moment, otherwise it probably would have been killed. Perhaps the same thing would happen if, for example, a kestrel did not dodge or defend itself in time? It is, on the whole, hardly possible to draw a distinct boundary-line between real hunts and attacks against inadequate objects. It should also be borne in mind that a specialization on rare prey or an aberrant mode of hunting is of fairly great interest from a theoretical point of view, whether a selective effect is found or not. One type of hunting, however, has been consistently excluded from the statistics, viz., hunting or chasing of birds of the same species. It is not always possible for an observer to determine whether two sparrow-hawks which have a scuffle together in the air, are actually fighting or only "playing". According to LORENZ (1. c. p. 372-373), most predatory animals have inhibitions which prevent the killing of their own species. NIETHAMMER (1938) says, however, "je nach den Nahrungsbedingungen reguliert sich der Sperberbestand von selbst, notfalls durch Kannibalismus". I do not know on what NIETHAMMER bases his statement. Although LORENZ' theory is not always applicable I am of the opinion that the "attacks" made by the sparrow- hawks against each other, as a r u 1 e, do not have the character of real hunting and that the error would be increased if such cases were included in the statistics. If the material is added up in conformity with the above principles one finds that 23 hunts of 213 gave results, i. e., 10.8 per cent. If hunting of</page><page sequence="15">The choice of prey and modes of hunting of predatory birds 79 predatory birds are excluded the figures are 23 out of 190, i.e., 12.1 per cent. On account of the incompleteness of the diaries with regard to un- successful hunts before 1942, it would be more correct to calculate the percentage only on the material collected during the years 1942 to 1947. The figures will then be 20/203 and 201180, respectively, i. e., 9.9 and 11.1 per cent. There are several contributory factors, however, that make even these figures too high: a) Even during the years 19,42 to 1947 many unsuccessful hunts were not recorded. b) All dubious cases are excluded from the hunting statistics. c) The definition of the concept of hunting as adopted here is a narrow one (cf. p. 74). d) Observations were chiefly made during the autumnal migration in Falsterbo, that is to say in a place where birds are abundant. This is true both for sparrow-hawk and suitable prey of various kinds. The percentage number of successful hunts is therefore probably com- paratively large. On certain occasions this is definitely the case, see for instance October 13, 1942. Compare. also DROST, 1930, for a similar case. It should also be mentioned that my most comprehensive annotations and most detailed observations are from 1944, when I was in Falsterbo from August 1, to November 13. It appears from table 3 that the number of successful hunts that year was only about 5 per cent of the total amount. I am of the opinion that the hunting of the sparrow-hawk is successful in one case out of twenty, or perhaps still less frequently. Of the 190 hunts on non-predatory birds, at least 163 consisted of attacks made from a short distance. 13 other cases which are noted down less care- fully, can also be added to this group. The mode of hunting showed some variation, of course: some hunts were of very short duration, others could be characterized as eager pursuit, others consisted of repeated stoops against one and the same prey. The total number of completed attacks and attempts at seizure probably amounts to about 500. A total of 22 victims was taken during these hunts. The remaining 14 hunts were all attacks from a great distance but varied in other respects. In a few cases the sparrow-hawk made an extremely rapid attack in an almost horizontal course towards the prey. A song-thrush, which was quite easily observed in a leafless hedge, was taken in this man- ner (case no. 9 below). I have seen a few other instances when sparrow- hawks used a hunting method similar to that employed by the peregrine falcon: a rapid and powerful stoop in a long, straight course, slanting down</page><page sequence="16">80 Gustaf Rudebeck towards birds in mid-air. However, all such attempts failed. In its extreme form this hunting method appears to be very rare. Sometimes, especially during the migration seasons, sparrow-hawks may practise a peculiar mode of hunting, which seems to have been given little attention so far. Sparrow-hawks at a very great height, often 200-400 metres, suddenly plunge downwards in a very steep course. Sometimes, they dive almost vertically, other times at an angle of perhaps 65? to 750, in a steep, but not always quite straight, course all the way to the ground. During the dive they fold their wings, the wing tips are directed backwards, the alulae are stretched strongly forwards and the legs downwards, preparatory to seizing the prey - a most remarkable sight. Obviously they are striking at a prey on the ground or very close to the ground. I did not become more closely acquainted with this mode of hunting until late in the summer of 1945. Since then I have seen it used many times, almost exclusively by birds on migration. I have never observed them capture a quarry during these hunts; the final outcome is, however, often unknown to the observer. I am, therefore, not in a position to give any opinion as to the effectiveness of the method. The technique has, however, one disadvantage: Although the prospective victim is selected from afar and under circumstances which allow the bird to approach very rapidly because the prey is on the ground, the hawk must brake abruptly before reaching its quarry. The advantages of this technique are thereby largely eliminated, in contrast to the mode of hunting employed by the peregrine and the merlin. Nevertheless, short-distance hunting is by far the most common hunting method of the sparrow-hawk. I agree, therefore, on the whole with TINBERGEN (1946, p. 97, 194) when he says: "Generally speaking, there seems to be little individual variation in the hunting technique." Successful hunts of the sparrow-hawk The following list includes my observations on the successful hunts of the sparro~w- hawk, together with comments. Case 1 was observed in Halsingborg, nos. 2 and 31 in the Krankesjb-area, previously well-known for its abundant birdlife, approximately 20 kilometers east of Lund. All' the other hunts were observed in Falsterbo. 1. February, 1929, during a very cold and snowy winter. A great number of bramblings (Fringilla montifringilla), some greenfinches (Chloris chloris), and other finches as well as a blackbird (Turdus merula), which lacked several tail-feathers, were at a feeding-place for small birds outside my window. I had observed the blackbird at the same place for some time. Suddenly a sparrow-hawk made a surprise attack and seized the blackbird, the only specimen present which to my knowledge was abnormal. It may, however.</page><page sequence="17">The choice of prey and modes of hunting of predatory birds 81 have been taken not on account of its defectiveness but because it was easily noticed. 2. October 17, 1937. A female sparrow-hawk was flying quite low over a sandy stubble- field. Suddenly it wheeled around rapidly, alighted, and almost disappeared, although the ground was flat and the vegetation very low. Two starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) flew up where the hawk alighted. After some minutes the hawk arose again with a starling in its claws, but settled in a bush surrounded by tall grass. Frightened, the sparrow-hawk flew up from the ground near by without its quarry. The starling was soon found sitting in the grass. It had been plucked on a small portion of the upper back but was otherwise uninjured. There was no sign of blood on the bird, and the legs and wings where unbroken. When released, the starling uttered a faint "tirrrr" and flew off. This was a surprise attack from a short distance. The sparrow-hawk was, flying low but did not otherwise take cover. Apparently it discovered the starlings rather late - but before any one of the three birds noticed the danger. The flock of starlings, consisting of only three individuals, was remarkably small. The sparrow- hawk appeared probably at a moment when the three starlings' happened to be in such a position that they did not observe the danger. Such a coincidence must be practically out of the question for large flocks of starlings. 3. December 19, 1937. A large flock of yellow-hammers (Emberiza citrinella) in a court-yard were suddenly alarmed and all the birds flew up into surrounding trees. Suddenly an old male sparrow-hawk appeared, flying low with a male yellow- hammer in its claws. This is another example of a surprise attack from a short distance. Although the actual moment of seizure was not noticed the observation has been included since the manner of capture was evident from the circumstances. 4. August 15, 1942. 0360. Five sparrow-hawks were seen together over quite flat and treeless meadow-ground. One of them seized an indeterminable small bird, the other 4 hawks started on migration flight and disappeared over the sea. Unfortunately my annotations' of the case are scanty but apparently this' was another example of short distance hunting. It is p o ss'i b l e that the small bird was in a very difficult situation as five sparrow-hawks appeared at the same! time, but this is by no means clear. D. August 27, 1942. 0549. A sparrow-hawk pursued and seized a wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe). The wheatear was surprised while rising but was not captured until 6i after a rapid pursuit in swerves and zigzags. 7 October 13, 1942. 1200-1300. Both sparrow-hawks and song-thrushes (Turdus 8 ericetorum philomelos) were extremely common in Falsterbo. I witnessed many hunts, approximatively 10, at least 3 of which were successful. During the night of October 12-13, an unprecedented number of song-thrushes had arrived at Falsterbo on autumnal migration. Gardens, parks, and brushwood overflowed with song-thrushes. They did not keep together in definite flocks but were present everywhere. At the same time sparrow-hawks were extremely com- mon. The total number of sparrow-hawks in Falsterbo during this afternoon was at least 400, perhaps as many as 600. The observations made in Skanor and Falsterbo at noon on October 13, were extremely interesting. On several occasions I saw sparrow-hawks chasing song- thrushes; they attacked from short distance among the trees and pursued' their prey with frenzy. I had a definite impression that on that day the number of 6 - Oikos</page><page sequence="18">82 Gustaf Rudebeck successful hunts was much greater than normally. This is. quite natural too, for hunted or frightened song-thrushes that had just avoided one danger were often attacked by other sparrow-hawks which appeared unexpectedly. Many times, more- over, song-thrushes were attacked from several directions simultaneously. - Many remains of chaffinches, blackbirds, and song-thrushes which had been eaten were found in the brushwood. Most of them had quite obviously been caught by sparrow-hawks. Never before or afterwards I have experienced such a great concentration of predatory birds and suitable prey in such a limited area. My colleague, K. G. WINGSTRAND, assistant at the Zoological Institute of Lund, had a similar experience in Falsterbo on September 30, 1946. The number of sparrow-hawks was enormous; the species of small birds dominating on that occasion were robins (Erithacus rubecula) and song-thrushes. WINGSTRAND on that evening saw great quantities of sparrow-hawks which "leapt in the bushes in pursuit of robins and song-thrushes". He considered the number of successful hunts to have been strikingly great on that day. Cases like those described above are probably very rare, only occurring during migration periods and in localities where, for some reason or other, the migrating birds concentrate. They are thus special cases. But when they occur they are likely to cause a marked decimation of the number of prey present. 9. October 13, 1942. 1600. An adult male sparrow-hawk attacked a song-thrush which was sitting quite conspicuously in an open hedge. The sparrow-hawk came at a furious speed, simply seizing the song-thrush in the first attempt. This, was a surprise attack in an almost horizontal course of flight and from a comparatively great distance. - It should be noted that this observation was made on the same day as nos. 6, 7, and 8. 10. October 20, 1943. 0745. Two sparrow-hawks were flying along the coast-line in Falsterbo. They were "playing" with each other. Finally one of them disappeared; the other settled but rose soon again and started in pursuit of a goldcrest (Regulus regulus). The latter was finally seized in a swift turning movement less. than one metre above the sandy shore. The sparrow-hawk alighted on a wrack bank with its prey. During migration seasons, golderests are seen fairly often in such terrain, which actually is not at all suitable for them. Moreover, the behaviour of the golderest when faced with acute danger seems to differ considerably from that of other small birds. SVARDSON (1939) has aptly said, that panic is absolutely unknown in gold- crests. Panic in itself is of course no desirable quality, but a suitable, swift reaction of fear must be of the utmost importance, as far as one can judge. Many times I have observed golderests in exposed situations, where they did not seem to show any such reactions. The percentage loss is therefore probably unusually high for migrating gol:dcrests. 11. October 25, 1948. 0705. A sparrow-hawk approached, flying low. Suddenly it was seen to pursue an indeterminable small bird which it seized in the air with an elegant sweeping movement. 12. October 27, 1943. 0955. A flock of approximately 200 starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) approached at a moderate altitude on migration flight. They were openly attacked by a sparrow-hawk. I did not believe it would be successful, as attacks on flying birds which can manoeuvre f r e e 1 y, rarely succeed. However, this sparrow-hawk was extraordinarily intensive in its pursuit, made several very powerful attacks and</page><page sequence="19">The choice of prey and modes of hunting of predatory birds 83 finally dived straight down into the flock, seizing one starling. The sparrow-hawk, a fine old male, immediately settled with its prey. When frightened it moved only short distances at a time and seemed altogether unwilling to move. Perhaps it was exhausted from the chase? I maintain that this manner of seizing a quarry is very unusual. Sparrow- hawks are often observed to attack freely flying birds but these hunts are practic- ally always unsuccessful. The small birds attacked in this way do not react until the danger becomes imminent. 13. August 22, 1944. 0519. Two smaller flocks of starlings of 50 and 30 specimens, respectively, were seen over the open coast. They were simultaneously attacked by three sparrow-hawks. One of these seized a starling which happened to leave the flock. The starling was flying low, settling towards the ground when it was caught. The wording of my annotations indicates that this starling left the flock without being particularly eagerly pursued. Then a sparrow-hawk at once attacked and seized the solitary bird. This would then be a striking example of atypical be- haviour in a gregarious bird like the starling. In this particular case, however, several sparrow-hawks were pursuing the same flock simultaneously. When such instances occur, the position of the hunted animal is naturally much aggravated.. It is doubtful, therefore, whether one is justified in this case in speaking of atypical behaviour on the part of the hunted starling. 14. September 14, 1944. 0620. A merlin (Falco columbarius) was chasing a young swallow (Hirundo rustica) flying quite low. The swallow made swift, long zig-zags in different directions, every time avoiding the falcon very gracefully. Suddenly a sparrow-hawk appeared at a tremendous speed flying only one or two feet above the ground, then rising a little it directly seized the swallow. The sparrow- hawk alighted with its prey. The age of the swallow was later determined from the remains of feathers. The swallow could evidently manage the merlin but did not observe the sparrow- hawk until too late. Two predatory birds with different modes of hunting, which attack the same quarry simultaneously, naturally constitute a great danger. How- ever, such cases are rare. 5a. November 2, 1944. 1600. A sparrow-hawk pursued, a small bird over ground covered with heather, bushes and small trees. The hunt was unsuccessful. The small bird alighted on the top of a small, thin birch where it was fully visible. The sparrow- hawk settled in the same tree, about 2 metres nearer the ground. When the sparrow- hawk rose, the small bird also took flight and passed ov e r the sparrow-hawk. The latter made a rapid swerve and seized the bird. This its a very curious, incident, studied from close quarters. It is particularly remarkable that a small bird, which has been pursued' by a sparrow-hawk and escaped, perched quite openly in the top of a small tree, all the more so as the terrain offered good protection. - The almost "impudent" manner in which the sparrow-hawk watched its prey is also curious. Finally, it is noteworthy that the small bird, which rose in fairly good time, should manoeuvre in such a way as to pass close above the sparrow-hawk! Unfortunately I could not determine the species of the small bird. but it was probably a meadow-pipit (Anthus pratensis). 16. September 3, 1945. 0615. A sparrow-hawk flying extremely low over the open</page><page sequence="20">84 Gustaf Rudebeck grassy shore seized a bird in flight and alighted with it. From the remains of the feathers it could be established that the birds was a starling. The hunt concerned one single bird. No flock of starlings is mentioned on this occasion. The species of the prey could not be determined while the hunt was in progress. I was surprised to find that it was a starling as solitary starling are not common during migration periods. Such individuals are almost certainly defective in one way or other. 17. September 19, 1945. 0725. A merlin (Falco columbarius) was observed chasing a small bird over the grassy shore. The bird escaped, however, but a sparrow-hawk approached and seized it at the water's edge. Afterwards the sparrow-hawk flew away over the sea with its quarry, pursued by the merlin. This is still another case of two predatory birds of different species attacking one and the same prey. As in the preceding instance (no. 14), the sparrow- hawk won. 18. September 27, 1945. 1456. While standing on "Ljungen", the heath near Falsterbo I observed with field-glasses a hen-harrier (Circus cyaneus) and a peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) tumbling together in the air. The ground in front of me was absolutely flat and there were no bushes for a distance of several hundred metres. Approximately 20 metres behind me there were some birch bushes, and behind these there was a vegetation of birch, willow, and bramble. - I stood still for a long time with the glasses before my eyes. Suddenly I felt a hard blow on the field-glasses which were pushed into my face. I turned around rapidly, catching sight of a sparrow-hawk diving into a birch bush. It reappeared immediately with a small bird in its claws, flew about 50 metres and settled in a thicket with its prey. After a-bout 15 minutes I went there and found remains of the prey, a redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus). This is an interesting and instructive case. Standing motionless there on the heath I was the only high object which could give cover to the sparrow-hawk. The hawk took advantage of this fact. It came from the large treeless region flying towards the birch bushes behind me. When doing so it took the only course which enabled it to approach unseen the bush in which the quarry was sitting. The sparrow-hawk thus flew straight towards me, passing so close over my head that it touched the field-glasses, dived into the bush behind me, and took the redstart by surprise. 19. October 1, 1945. 1025. A sparrow-hawk seized a freely flying song-thrush in a very swift attack at a comparatively great height - approximately 10 metres - over the flat grassy shore. The hawk alighted at once with its prey among some small pine bushes. This case is quite remarkable. The song-thrush, as is known, is decidedly a night migrant and is rarely seen flying freely over the heaths, meadowlands, and shores in Falsterbo during day-time. When this does occur, it holds good only for isolated individuals which show evident signs of Emigration restlessness", and the song-thrush in question behaved in this manner. In addition it may be mentioned that the song-thrush avoids appearing in the open except during the singing period in spring. HORTLING (192 9) has appropriately characterized its behaviour with the following anthropomorphic expression "The song-thrush lives in aristocratic seclusion and seems almost afraid to show him- self". His words are especially true of populations in northern and eastern Europe. In western Europe, as is well known, the ecology of the species has changed and</page><page sequence="21">The choice of prey and modes of hunting of predatory birds 85 the birds have become inhabitants of gardens and parks. This procedure ha~s been going on in S~cania for about 15 years. 20. October 16, 1945. 0740. A sparrow-hawk was pursuing a thrush over the sandy shore. The thrush was hard pressed but settled in a thick vegetation of Atriplex and became invisible. The sparrow-hawk alighted at the top of an Atriplex plant and remained motionless for several minutes. Finally the sparrow-hawk made a slight movement and the thrush took flight. (It should be pointed out, however, that it was impossible to determine with certainty which bird moved first. The thrush was in among the plants, invisible to me and probably also to the sparrow- hawk. It may thus be possible that the thrush moved first, whereupon the sparrow- hawk chanced its position.) A new wild hunt followed quite close to the ground with rapid zig-zagging at very high speed. The distance between the birds was only a few centimeters. On one occasion the thrush lost some feathers but wa's not seized. The hunt continued and after a few metres, more of intense pursuit the thrush was caught. The sparrow-hawk settled quite openly but in a shallow depres- sion in the ground where it could not be seen. The hunt took place near to the observer. The prey was found to be a redwing (Turdus musicus). - I collected also the small feathers which were knocked off the thrush in the first, unsuccessful attack. These feathers were from the back of the bird. This hunt was of uncommon intensity. Both birds evidenced a manoeuvring skill and a swiftness that were almost incredible. 21. October 27, 1945. 1435. A flock of exactly 15 chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs) on migration flight approached over the small dense pine grove near the light-house at Falsterbo. A sparrow-hawk made a swift attack and almost certainly seized one chaffinch. Fourteen specimens continued their migration. 22. October 31, 1946. 1130. A sparrow-hawk seized a chaffinch from a resting flock which was perched on telephone wires in a clearing in wooded terrain. This was a surprise attack from a short distance. 23. October 1, 1946. 0a562. A sparrow-hawk seized a small bird, probably a goldcrest, while hunting over the open grassy shore. The small bird was flying low but rose slightly; the sparrow-hawk came in pursuit and caught the bird in a graceful ascending sweep. (This case was reported to me by K. G. Wingstrand.) As pointed out above, my observations have chiefly been made in autumn. The successful hunts are distributed as follows: February 1, August 3, September 4, October 13), November 1, December 1. In two cases observed in October and in the December case I have expressly mentioned that the sparrow-hawk was an adult bird. Otherwise age and sex is usually not noted. I have noticed, however, when observing migrating birds, that only juvenile sparrow-hawks migrate in August and the first half of September; later, older birds also migrate but they do not become numerous and dominant until the middle of October. One can, therefore, be certain that the hunts prior to September 15 are performed solely by juvenile birds, the hunts after about Oetober 15, on the other hand, largely by old birds. Regarding the interval from September 15 to October 15, it is difficult to express a definite opinion. Discussion of the hunts It is easy to recognize a sparrow-hawk in the field. It is often much more difficult to determine the species of small bird that is chased by a sparrow-</page><page sequence="22">86 Gustaf Rudebeck hawk, not because the small bird in itself is difficult to recognize but simply because many hunts take place at such a distance that the sparrow-hawk is still easily recognized but the small bird difficult or impossible to determine with certainty. Another factor that complicates the determination of the hunted animal is the general hunting technique of the sparrow-hawk, for many attacks occur at very low altitudes, often more or less hidden by vegetation etc. Since even a determination. of the species of the prey often proves comparatively difficult it is naturally almost impossible to notice abnormalities in them, such as discoloring, injuries, or such. A noteworthy or deviating behaviour is easier to discover if observational conditions are favourable and the normal behaviour of the various species are known. Often the sparrow-hawk seizes its prey so rapidly that the latter hardly has time to react but is caught where it is, or when taking wing, or at least before gaining enough speed to manoeuvre freely. Examples are cases nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 1.8, 21, and 22. A few of the special cases mentioned below can also be assigned to this category. Sometimes, but not as often, the prey is seized after a prolonged chase (nos. 5, 10, 16, 20, and 23), which may be either in the form of an unbroken pursuit or divided more or less clearly into several stoops. In the latter case the sparrow-hawk seeks every time a favourable position of attack. This method, however, is far more distinctly and typically developed in the merlin and still more so in the peregrine. The sparrow-hawk often attacks birds flying in mid-air but usually only from a short distance and when a surprise attack is possible. These hunts, however, almost always fail. Some of my observations are probably not typical as they were made during migration periods in a place where very great numbers of predatory birds and prey were assembled. I have thus in two instances (nos. 14 and 17) seen a sparrow-hawk strike down a small bird which was already pursued by a merlin, and in another case (no. 13) three sparrow-hawks were observed to attack two smaller flocks of starling during which one of the hawks seized a bird. A comparatively great number of successful hunts occurred during the course of one day when an extreme concentration of sparrow- hawk and song-thrush occurred in the same place (nos. 6, 7, 8, and 9, dis- cussed above). Sparrow-hawks with untypical hunting methods have been observed in a few cases; no. 9 exemplifies a successful long stoop, no. 12 showed amazing swiftness, power, and tenacity in its attacks on a, flock of starlings. Only in one case (no. 1) was abnormal appearance, damage, illness, or anything of that kind noted in the prey. On account of the mode of hunting</page><page sequence="23">The choice of prey and modes of hunting of predatory birds 87 such deficiencies must necessarily be difficult to observe even if they occur quite frequently. I observed, however, also some instances of deviating behaviour in the prey: No. 9 (song-thrush perched unusually openly) No. 10 goldcrestt in unusual environment) No. 13 (probably wrong behaviour in starling) No. 15 (extremely remarkable behaviour of pursued small bird) No. 16 (solitary starling) No. 19 (song-thrush which showed migration restlessness in the daytime and appeared in a very unusual environment) Nos. 2 and 23 may perhaps also be included in this group. I am quite aware that these observations alone cannot be made the basis of categorical statements. Certain cases are slightly ambiguous or may perhaps represent a special case (no. 10). On the other hand, it is obvious that the blackbird in no. 1 was defective and that nos. 9, 15, 16, and 19 displayed unusual behaviour. Consequently, in five cases out of 23 atypical qualities in the prey could be established. This is a high frequency, at least of an entirely different order of magnitude than that obtained when studying defects and abnormalities of birds in the field. It indicates that the sparrow-hawk seizes first of all those animals that are defective in some respect or show less suitable reactions, etc. This assumption is naturally borne out by the fact that the sparrow-hawk so often misses its quarry. The attacks of sparrow-hawks against flocks of birds must be discussed separately. Such attacks are very common during migration periods and in the winter; at least 60 of the 190 hunts were directed at flocks, and prey was seized in 5 cases (nos. 3, 12, 13, 21, and 23). It was impossible to decide whether the hawk from the beginning concentrated upon any particular individual in the flock or if it attacked the flock as a whole, selecting its prey only when the result of the fright reaction became evident. Sometimes, however, it seized a. bird before any individual in the flock had had time to react appreciably. It is difficult to believe in, a selective effect in such cases, except in such instances when one individual differs from the others in colour, position, movements, or so on. Predatory birds are sometimes seen with recently captured quarry although the hunt itself or the moment of seizure was not witnessed. I have recorded about 15 of these cases as far as the sparrow-hawk is concerned. In most of these instances it is, of course, impossible to draw any conclusions as to the condition of the killed animals. I experienced one interesting exception to this rule. In October, 1944, a solitary dunlin (Calidris alpna) was observed at the so-called Nabben, i. e., the most southwestern point in Falsterbo,</page><page sequence="24">88 Gustaf Rudebeck where the Sound and the Baltic Sea meet. In spite of the fact that several small flocks of dunlins passed and sometimes alighted for a while this bird never joined a flock but kept to itself all the time. This is particularly remarkable as the dunlin is a very social bird during migration. The be- haviour of the dunlin was in other words entirely atypical and it was easy to see that it was not well; most of the time it stood still and was not at all as lively in its movements as a normal dunlin, but no external injury could be observed. On October 12, it was quite alone on Nabben the entire morning but was then seized by a sparrow-hawk. I did not see the actual hunt but arrived shortly afterwards when the sparrow-hawk was devouring its prey. (To be continued)</page></plain_text>
