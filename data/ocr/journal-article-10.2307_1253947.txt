<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EUROPEAN SKY-GOD. III: THE ITALIANS. BY ARTHUR BERNARD COOK. THE Latin language bears witness to an early animistic conception of the sky. For the common expression sub divo, "under the open sky," stands in an obvious relation to the doublets divus and deus, which are the ordinary terms for "god."' Of kindred origin were the names Iu-piter (with its variant forms Dius, Diovis, lovis, etc.), Dies-piter (with dies, etc.), and certain others to be mentioned later.2 This whole group of words springs ultimately from a root div-, meaning "to shine" ;3 and it is probable that divum originally denoted the sky as "bright," divus or deus a god who dwelt in the " bright" sky, lu-piter the "Bright" One as "Father." The close interconnexion of the said words, satisfactorily demon- strated by modern philologists, was already appreciated in the first century B.C. by M. Terentius Varro, who writes in his great treatise On the Latin Tongue:4 "Jupiter 1 W. M. Lindsay The Latin Language p. 244- 2See Aust in W. H.

After him his children were called dei. Hence too the names dius and divus, which gave rise to the phrases sub divo and Dius Fidius. Consequently the roof of his temple has a hole in it so that the divum or sky may be seen. And certain persons affirm that no oath by this god' ought to be taken under cover of a roof." In the sequel Varro definitely identifies Jupiter with the sky,2 as Ennius had done more than a century before him. Cicero3 quotes from the latter a couple of detached lines, which may be rendered- C" aspice hoc sublime candens, quem invocant omnes Iovem." Look at yonder Brilliance o'er us, whom the world invokes as Jove. and- "Cqui, quod in me est, exsecrabor hoc, quod lucet, quidquid est." Wherefore with all my might I'll curse yon Light, whate'er it be. There can be little doubt that in these passages the poet has caught and made permanent for us the religious thought of the Italians in the moment of its transition from an animistic to an anthropomorphic stage. Behind him lay the divine sky: in front stood the sky-god Jupiter. As a bright sky-god Jupiter bore the title Lucetius, the "Light-bringer." Servius4 in his commentary on the Aeneid says: "In the Oscan language Lucetius means " This god" means Dius Fidius. Scaliger cited from Nonius Marcellus s.v. " rituis" a fragment of Varro's Cato, a treatise on the education of children, in which we read: " And so our domestic practice is that whoever wishes to swear by Dius Fidius is wont to step beneath the opening in the roof." Scaliger also compared Plut. quaestt. Rom. 28, where we are told that boys who swore by Hercules were not allowed to do so under a roof, but had to go out of doors for the purpose. 2Varr. de ling.

Macrobius 1 observes: "We hold that Jupiter is the author of light (lucis), whence also the Salii sing of him in their songs as Lucetius." His remark is borne out by a scrap of Salian verse quoted in a Latin grammar2 dating from the reign of Hadrian: When thou thunderest, Lzght-bringer (Leucesie), before thee quail all men and gods and the broad sea. A. Gellius3 in the second century of our era writes of Jupiter: "He was called Diovis and Lucetius, because he furnished us and helped us with day (die) and light (luce), as it were with life itself. Jupiter is termed Lucetius by Cn. Naevius in his Punic War." Paulus Diaconus,4 whose glossary goes back to an important work written by M. Verrius Flaccus in the reign of Augustus, similarly states that "Lucetius was a name once given to Jupiter because men believed him to be the cause of light (lucis)." Lastly, C. Marius Victorinus,5 a grammarian of the fourth century, has preserved the older form Loucetius.6 The Latin scholars who discuss the word Lucetius commonly couple with it a second lingua Oscorum dictus a luce, quam hominibus praestare putatur, Iuppiter Lucceius, a Latinis vero Diespiter, id est diei pater vocatur. A different corruption is found in a gloss cited by J. J. Pontanus (ad Macrob. Sat. r. 15. 14): Lucerius, Zet6, and in another cited by Fulvius Ursinus (ad Paul. exc. Fest. Io. s.v.

Diespiter, "Day-Father." On a Praenestine cistaI of the fifth or sixth century B.C a bearded male figure standing next to Juno (Ivno) is called Diespiter (Diesptr); and thenceforward the name is used by Latin authors as a synonym of lupiter.2 As Jupiter was Lucetius, so his consort Juno was Lucetia or Lucina.3 In their capacity of light-god and light- goddess they not only brought daylight to men, but also controlled the changes of the moon. The Ides of all the months, i.e. the days of the full moon, were sacred to Jupiter; the Kalends, i.e. the days of the new moon, to Juno.4 And the day on which the full moon occurred was known as "the Pledge of Jupiter" (Iovis fiducia),5 because the night being as bright as day gave as it were a promise of day's renewal. From Jupiter as sky-god to Jupiter as weather-god was not a far cry. For the old popular phrase sub divo, " under the open sky," poets of the Augustan age wrote 1 Monumenti dall' Inst. vi. pl. 54, Annali dell' Inst. Arch. I86I p. 151 ff. 2So in an old formula ap. Liv. I. 24. 8 (with variants dies Zuppiter, Diesiuppiter, etc.), also in Plaut. capt. 909, Poen. 740, 869, Hor. od. 1. 34- 5, 3. 2. 29, and often in post-Augustan writers. Seneca (ludus de morte Claudii 9. 4) distinguishes Diespiter from Jupiter and describes him as "the son of Vica Pota." This goddess, whose name was by some thought to signify conquest and possession (Cic. de legg. 2. 28 vincendi. .. potiundi), by others eating and drinking (Arnob. adv. nat. 3. 25 Vita et Potua, cp. Varro ap. Aug. de civ. Dei 4. II Potina... Educa and ap. Non. Marc. p. io8 Mere. Edusae. . . Potinae), was perhaps an Italian Aor-rowa (? *Vici-pota cp. *6eo?-rrdTrls). If so, her son, like the offspring of Zeus and Persephone (Clem. Alex. protr. 2. 16 p. 14 Potter, Arnob. adv. nat. 5. 20 f.), would be chthonian in character. Should we therefore restore Dis pater for Diespiter in Senec. lud. 9. 4?

Ovid says of the early Arcadians: 'Neath Jupiter they would endure, and bare of limb they went, To face the downpour of the sky or blustering South content.1 So of the Romans at the festival of Anna Perenna: Some must endure 'neath Jupiter, and some must pitch a booth.2 Demeter in search of Persephone- Steadfast 'neath Jupiter endured for many a weary day, And patient marked the moonlight fall or rain-storm on its way.3 While of Clytie, who fell in love with the Sun, we read: 'Neath Jupiter by night and day she sat upon the ground.4 The same author elsewhere tells how Juno was jealous of- 7he nymphs who 'neath her upiter lay on the mountain-side." Horace too can write: The hunter still 'neath freezing Jupiter Must tarry heedless of his loving wife.6 Such expressions, however illogical, had a certain poetic value. So had the rhetorical, though sometimes far- fetched, use of the word Iupiter to denote "the sky" or " the weather." The author of the poem Aetna,7 wrongly ascribed to Virgil, writes: " quamvis caeruleo siccus Iove fulgeat aether." Though the dry air should shine with sky-blue Jove. 1 Ov. fast. 2. 299 f. 2 Ov. fast. 3. 527. Ov. fast. 4. 505 f. 40v. met. 4. 260. 50v. met. 3. 363- 6 Hor. od. I. I. 25 f. Cp. Stat.

Furius Bibaculus for his line- " Iuppiter hibernas cana nive conspuit Alpes." Jove on the wintry Alps spits the white snow.1 But Horace himself in describing an inclement climate speaks of "clouds and a sorry Jupiter." 2 Virgil in his Georgics has: For ripe grapes you may well dread Jupiter.3 Again he calls a rainy atmosphere, "Jupiter wet with South winds," or "Jupiter shivering with South winds,"'4 and in a famous passage concerning the spring-time says: Then the almighty Father of the sky Into the bosom of his joyous bride With fostering showers falls.5 Petronius, not unmindful of his Virgil, in a list of portents includes the following: Sudden fell Jupiter in a shower of blood." This in turn was imitated by Claudian, who in the course of a similar list writes: Jupiter, threatening, flushed with a cloud of blood.7 1 Hor. sat. 2. 5. 41, with Porphyrio, Acro, and schol. Cruq. ad loc. : see Biihrens Frag. poet. Rom. p. 319. The demerit of Furius' unlucky line (which is quoted by Quint. inst. orat. 8. 6. 17) of course lies in the metaphor conspuit, not in the metonymy Iuppiter. 2 Hor. od. I. 22. 19 f. Cp. Stat.

Valerius Flaccus and Statius, in describing a storm at sea, both speak of "wintry Jupiter":1 the latter also of " cloudy Jupiter."'2 Martial has not only "the shower of Jove," but also "the rains and soaking Jove." ' And, finally, in a line of Juvenal we hear of: The vernal Jupiter hissing with pitiless hail.4 The prose writers, even in the silver age of Latin litera- ture, refrain from such venturesome expressions, though Arnobius makes the defenders of the old mythology interpret Jupiter as "the rain,"''5 and Augustine men- tions that Jupiter was sometimes identified with "the sky." " But the conception of Jupiter as a weather-god was by no means confined to men of letters. As the Greeks had their Poseidon or " Zeus-in-the-rain-water " (iroreL- Aaq),7 so the Italians recognized a watery Jupiter.

The bearded head of Jupiter on a denarius of L.

Aurelius was rescued from the surrounding Quadi by the interposition of a god, who refreshed the fainting legionaries with a down- pour of rain, while he blasted their opponents with hail and thunderbolts.'

The cult of Jupiter as a rain-god can be traced back to a remote antiquity. Petronius1 says: "Formerly the women wearing stoles used to go bare-foot to the Capitol, with dishevelled hair but pure hearts, and would implore Jupiter for water. Presto! it came down in bucketsful. Now or never was the word: and they all got home like drowned rats!" Tertullian2 refers to the same rite: "Since summer and winter depend on the rains and the seasons must be considered . . . you offer water-charms (aquilicia) to Jupiter, you proclaim bare-foot processions (nudipedalia) to the populace, you seek your sky on the Capitol and look for clouds from the ceiling, turning your backs upon the true God and the true Heaven." Some further details of the ceremony are known.3 "The water-charm (aqua- eliciumn)," says Paulus Diaconus,4 "is the name given to certain means of extracting rain-water (quum aqua pluvialis remediis quibusdam elicitur), for instance, if we may believe it, to the old custom of drawing the streaming-stone (manali 'lapide) into the City." Varro,5 too, has a word on the subject: "We call a small-sized pitcher a water- jug (aquae manale) because by means of it water is poured into the basin. Hence the streaming-stone (manalis lapis) of the priestly ceremonies, which is moved when rains are required, gets its name. Again, we all know that in very ancient times men spoke of the streaming-rite (manale sacrum): this explains its name." These passages make it probable that the stone, which may have been a baetyl 1 Petr. sat. 44. 2Tert. apol. 40o. 3The sources and literature are cited e.g. by Wissowa in Roscher Lex. ii. 2308 f. and Pauly-Wissowa ii. 310. 4Paul. exc.

The stone normally stood outside the Porta Capena, near the temple of Mars ;2 but, for reasons which will subse- quently appear,3 this circumstance does not militate against its connexion with Jupiter. It has been plausibly maintained 4 that the Jupiter worshipped when the rain was charmed forth (elicitur) was Jupiter Elicius, who had an altar on the Aventine.6 If so, it may have been thought that Jupiter himself came down in the form of a shower-a conception voiced by Virgil in a passage already quoted.6 But Jupiter Elicius was a thunder-god as well as a rain-god; for it was he who, when the people was panic-stricken by continual lightnings and rain, showed King Numa how the storms might be stayed,7 and at a later date slew with a thunderbolt Numa's successor, Tullus Hostilius.8 We have, therefore, also to reckon with the belief that Jupiter might fall as a lightning-flash or a thunderbolt,9 appropriate manifestations 1So Serv. in Verg.

More than one extant inscription1 records the due burial of a "bright" or "divine lightning-flash," as though it were a thing instinct with mysterious life. Such flashes occurring by day were regarded as exhibitions of Jupiter Fulgur,2 i.e. Jupiter identified with his own flash. According to Vitruvius,3 " Hypaethral buildings will be erected under the clear sky (sub diu) to Jupiter the Lightning (Iovi Fulguri), to Caelus, to Sol, and to Luna; for we see the forms and effects of these divinities before our eyes in the open and shining vault of heaven." One such building or precinct dedicated to Jupiter Fulgur stood in the Campus Martius at Rome.4 Jupiter is further identified with the thunderbolt in an inscription 5 found near Vienna, which reads: IOVI FVLGVRI * FVLMINI To ufpiter the Lightning and the Thunderbolt: perhaps also in dedications6 to Jupiter Flagius, Flazius, or Flazzus, i.e. the "Flashing" Jupiter. A later stage of religious thought is marked by another dedication 7 from Anguillara on the Lago di Bracciano: SACR * IOVI ? TONANTI - FVLMINANTI Sacred to Jupiter who sends the Thunder and the Thunderbolt.- for here the god is more plainly anthropomorphic. 1 H.

The rain-storm goes to swell the streams or pools ; and it is interesting to find that Juturna, an ancient Latin goddess of "lakes and sounding rivers," 4 bore a name akin to that of Jupiter.5 Moreover, Virgil and Ovid make Juturna beloved by Jupiter, who rewarded her with sovereignty over the waters.6 It should also be noticed on the one hand that Juturna was the name of a spring close to the river Numicius in Latium,7 on the other that there was a famous cult of Jupiter Indiges on the bank of the same river.8 The inscription on the sanctuary of Jupiter Indiges spoke of him as "presiding over the stream of the river Numicius."9 At Rome too Juturna may have been associated with Jupiter; for at the bottom of her well was 1E.g.

Of Jupiter as a sea-god there are but scanty traces. At Beneventum is a dedication 2 IOVI - TVTATORI - MARis To Jupiter who makes the Sea safe. Claudian calls Neptune " the watery Jupiter" 3 and even "our Jupiter " :4 but it is probable that he is using Iupiter merely in the sense of "a sovereign deity." Other evidence will be considered later.5 Jupiter was identified with the sun by late writers 6 and inscriptions : 7 but there is no reason to think that this identification was old."

At Iguvium the man who swore by Jupater Sancius held a similar wheel (urfeta =orbita) in his hand (Wissowa Rel. u. Kult. d. Rom. p. 121, n. 6). Cakes called summanalia and presumably sacred to Summanus, the nightly Jupiter, were made in the shape of a wheel (Fest. p. 267 Lindemann). The wheel was also a common symbol on the coinage of ancient Italy (A.

They named him Vediovis, Vedius, or Veiovis, and regarded him as in some sort an anti-Jove. Thus on the summit of the Alban Mount there was a cult of Jupiter Latiaris,3 in Bovillae at its base a cult of Vediovis:4 on the Capitol at Rome Jupiter Feretrius was worshipped,' in the hollow of the same hill Vediovis.6 The chthonian character of the latter deity is well attested. The ancient formula of devotion used by dictators and generals was addressed to Dis pater, Veiovis, Manes,7 i.e. to a group of chthonian powers. A law, attributed to Romulus, ordained that a patron or client who neglected his duties " might be put to death by any man, as a victim devoted to the chthonian Jupiter,"'8 i.e. to Vediovis.9 And Martianus Capella expressly identifies Vediovis with Pluto and Dis.1o There was, then, an early cult of a chthonian Jupiter, which justified the poets in calling the underground god Jupiter Stygius,"l Tartareus,12 infernus,13 niger,14 etc.15 1 Dessau 3057, 3058- 2Wissowa Rel. u.

As Ovid 2 puts it,- fupiter Rules heaven's height and the realms o' the threefold world. Several extant works of art represent him in this triple capacity. A chalcedony scarab of Etruscan workmanship, formerly in the Dehn collection,3 shows a naked male deity with a himation over his left arm in the act of stepping into a chariot. He grasps a thunderbolt in his right hand, a trident in his left; while at his feet is a dog. We can hardly be mistaken in regarding this singular figure as Jupiter in his threefold r6le: the thunderbolt marks him as a sky-god, the trident as a water-god, the dog (Cerberus ?) and the chariot as an earth-god.4 Again, at Albano was found a broken bas-relief of archaistic style thus described by Brunn :5 "The central figure is a god, bearded and crowned, who by the attributes of a thunder- bolt and a trident on his right, and a cornucopia sur- mounted by an eagle on his left side is shown to be Jupiter conceived as lord of the sky, the sea, and the underworld."

The title lutor and certain black strokes, which have been taken to denote an architectural cornice,' show that we have here to do with an actual cult. It is obviously that of the triple Jupiter: the thunderbolt belongs to him as a sky-god; the trident and dolphin as a sea-god; the fork as an earth- god. Lastly, it is significant that Vediovis, the chthonian Jupiter, is represented on coins of the Roman gentes with a thunderbolt 2 or a trident:3 in other words, the earth-god has the attributes of the sky-god and the sea-god. We might almost say with the author of the Asclepius:4 "Jupiter Plutonius is lord alike of land and sea." In dealing with the Greeks I 5 showed that superhuman power was at first expressed by various grotesque or monstrous forms with a plurality of heads, arms, legs, etc.; that a convenient substitute for this plurality, and one strictly in accordance with primitive thought, was found in a three-bodied or three-headed or three-eyed shape; and that another such suggestion of manifold activity was conveyed by double or Janiform figures. For example, Argus, the Argive Zeus, had a hundred eyes, or else had three eyes, or else had a Janiform head." We have next to see whether the multiple, the triple, and the dual types of divinity are equally applicable to Jupiter. It may be at once admitted that they are not. On the contrary, there are very few traces indeed of abnormal 1 Annali dell Instituto Arck. lii. 63. 2E.

Jupiters. Augustine1 speaks of a Jupiter Centumpeda, "the Hundred-footed," and explains the title as denoting ability to establish things or set them on foot (stabiliendi). Rather it was a survival from the grotesque or monstrous stage of Jupiter worship. Of the triple Jupiter there is not a trace on Italian soil; though the Sicilians, as I have argued elsewhere,2 had in their three-eyed Cyclops a real parallel to the three-eyed Zeus of Argos. One or two Janiform Jupiters exist: there is a double bust of the god in the Palazzo Spada at Rome; 3 and a coin of Geta exhibits a double-headed Jupiter (perhaps Jupiter Quirinus 4) holding a spear in his right hand, a thunderbolt in his left.5 But such representations may be, after all, only late accommodations to the well-known type of Janus.6 In general, the Italian conception of Jupiter was singularly free from distortion or deformity. At this point, however, it must be remembered that Janus was in all probability only the older form of Jupiter.7 Corssen8 and other philologists have proved that, from the etymological point of view, the following pairs of deities should be equated: ZEv's (Zwv) and AAinyv. Dianus (Janus) and Diana (Jana). Jupiter and Juno. 1Aug. de civ. Dei 7. II dixerunt eum (sc.

Several titles of Janus recall those of Jupiter. Thus the oldest hymns of the Salii saluted him as "deorum deus," 2 and he was often invoked as lanus pater or Ianuspater.3 Conversely Jupiter was actually surnamed Janus; for an inscription from Aquileia records a dedication lovi Diano.4 Again, according to one version Janus, not Jupiter, was the mate of Juturna ;5 and the title Janus Junonius implies a similar relation to Juno.6 On certain occasions joint offerings were made to Janus and Jupiter, or to Janus and Juno, or to Janus and Jupiter and Juno.7 Janus alone took precedence of Jupiter in the divine hierarchy;8 and the rex sacrorum or priestly king at Rome, who seems to have been in a sense his special ministrant, took similar precedence of the flamen Dialis or priest of Jupiter.9 These facts 1 Supra p. 260. Corssen loc. cit. wrongly derived the group from the root div- of dividere, divisio. Its connexion with dius, dium, "the shining sky," was already grasped by Buttmann Mythologus ii. 72, Schwegler Rdmische Geschichte i. 218 f., Preller Rbimische Mythologie i. 168. Indeed, P. Nigidius Figulus, a Pythagorean of the first century B.c., long since declared that Janus was a sun-god and Diana (Jana) his partner (Macrob. Sat. 1. 9. 8), while the opinion that he was a sky-god of some sort was very general in antiquity (see Roscher Lex. ii. 44). 2 Macrob. Sat. I. 9. 14, 16. Varro de ling. Lat. 7. 27 quotes a Salian line in which the phrase "divom deo" occurs. He has also (ib. 26) preserved five lines of a Salian hymn which, if we could be sure of the reading o Zeu (Lindsay Latin Language p. 5), would prove that the Salii identified Janus with Zeus.

Herodian 2 calls Janus " the oldest god native to the country of Italy "; Labeo says that he was termed " Patricius in the sense of an autochthon "; and Septimius Serenus4 addresses him in the following verse- "tibi vetus ara caluit Aborigineo sacello." For thee the ancient altar burned in Aboriginal shrine. Now, if Jupiter did not conform to the multiple, triple, and dual types of divinity, Janus did. An ancient image of Janus with four faces was brought from Falerii to Rome and set up in the Forum Transitorium. Hence he was called quadrzfrons, quadriformis, -erpi-pop0 o.5 On a common middle-brass of Hadrian he is portrayed with three faces :6 he stands looking towards us, a bearded figure with one hand resting on his hip and the other holding a sceptre, while his three visages are distinctly 1 See W. Ridgeway The Early Age of Greece i. 254 ff., who concludes that "the two main elements in the population of early Rome were the aboriginal Ligurians, who formed the Plebs, and the Umbrian Sabines, who formed the aristocracy." The statements of Dionysius cited by Prof. Ridgeway in support of his contention are, however, as Prof. J. S. Reid informs me, viewed with much suspicion by all modern critical historians. For my present purpose, it makes no difference whether the early inhabitants of Rome were called Aborigines or not. I only postulate that there was an early population of some sort and that its chief deity was Janus, not Jupiter. 2 Herodian hist. I. 49. 3 Labeo af. lo.

The existence of a triple Janus is further supported by the fact that his consort Diana or Jana was likewise triceps, triformis, triplex, tergemina.1 The usual type of Janus was, however, two-headed, or rather two-faced; and his customary epithets are biceps, biformis, bifrons, geminus.2 It would seem, therefore, that in Italy, as in Greece, the sky-god was at an early date conceived as of manifold, threefold, and twofold formation; though, so far as we know, no attempt was here made to equate the three faces of the god with the three provinces of nature over which he ruled.3 Jupiter, like Zeus, had the oak as his sacred tree.4 And probably for the same reason, viz. that it was the world- tree of southern Europe.5 This indeed must remain a mere conjecture since no description of an Italian world- tree has come down to us;6 but it may stand till a more convincing explanation is forthcoming.

I have collected the available evidence of this practice in the Classical Review for October 1904 ; and I shall here confine myself to citing a few typical cases of it. The earliest temple at Rome was that which Romulus himself planned for Jupiter Feretrius on the Capitol, where grew "an oak held sacred by the shepherds."'2 Vediovis, the chthonian Jupiter worshipped in the dip of the same hill, appears on coins of the Fonteii, Gargilii, and Ogulnii wearing a wreath of oak.3 Juno too, whose temple stood on the adjoining Arx, like Jupiter, had the oak as her sacred crown.4 On the Caelian, which in ancient times was covered with oak-woods and known as the Mons Querquetulanus,5 there was a Sacred Tree,6 presumably the tree of Jupiter Caelius who is represented on a bas-relief as standing beside his oak-tree.' Tibur worshipped Jupiter under the titles Custos, Praestes, Territor,8 and pointed to a clump of three ancient oaks as the spot where its eponym Tiburnus or Tiburtus had been inaugurated.9 At Praeneste, where oaks were so abundant that Servius1o derives the name of the town from them ('7rpivoq!), Fortuna Primigeniall had an oracular shrine close to the temple of Jupiter Arcanus :12 the famous sortes Praenestinae were graven in Aen. 4. 445 f. ipsa (sc. quercus) haeret scopulis, et, quantum vertice ad auras I aetherias, tantum radice in Tartara tendit. Another possible remini- scence of the Yggdrasill-tree occurs in connexion with Jupiter Tigillus, i.e. Jupiter "the Beam," who, according to Aug. de civ. Dei 7. 11, was so called "quod tamquam tigillus mundum contineret ac sustineret." 1 Class. Rev. xviii. 360 ff. 2 Liv. I. IO. 5. 3 Babelon monn. de la Rdp. i. 507, 532, ii. 266. 4 Plut. quaestt.

Indeed, the common cult of the Latins, that of Jupiter Latiaris, was carried on in a grove of oaks2 on the summit of the Alban Mount. As Jupiter and Juno had their oaks, so had Janus and Diana (Jana) before them. Pliny3 states that "on the Vatican is an oak-tree (ilex) older than Rome itself, bearing a bronze inscription in Etruscan letters, which proves that even in those early days the tree was thought worthy of religious veneration." This tree was probably sacred to Tina or Tinia, the Etruscan Jupiter,' though the proximity of the Janiculum, an ancient seat of Janus, makes it possible that it was a Janus-oak. Virgil5 speaks of an oak sacred to Father Tiber, who was regarded as the son of Janus." When the Plebs seceded to the Janiculum, it was in a grove of oaks by the Tiber-side that Q. Hortensius the dictator passed the law which induced them to return.7 Further, the title Quirinus, which was borne alike by Janus 8 and by Jupiter,9 I take to mean "the Oak-god," quiris being " the oaken spear" and Quirites "the men of the oaken spear."'10 Juno also was entitled Quiris or Quiritis."1 Diana, the original 1 Cic. de div. 2. 85. 2 Liv.

One of her most famous cults was that on Mount Tifata near Capua; and tifata meant "oak-groves."1 Another was on the oak-clad Mount Algidus; 2 propos of which it should be observed that, when in 458 B.c. Roman envoys were sent to complain of a treaty broken by the Aequians, they were bidden to make their complaint to a huge oak- tree on Mount Algidus, under the shade of whose branches the Aequian commander had his quarters.3 The chief temple of Diana at Rome was on the Aventine,4 whose slopes were covered in early days with the oak-wood of Picus and Faunus.5 A "very great and venerable sanctuary of Diana " was on the Caeliolus,6 which formed part of the Mons Querquetulanus.' Lastly, a relief in the Palazzo Colonna 8 shows a statue of Diana standing beside an old but fruitful oak. Substitutes for the oak are sometimes found in the cults of Italy, as in those of Greece.9 It is well known that the Greek word oryd7, "oak," appears in Latin as fagus, "beech." 10 The beech was in fact a religious as well as a verbal equivalent of the oak. Varro11 in his account of the Esquiline mentions the view that the hill derived its name from the oak-trees (aesculi) with which 1 Paul. exc. Fest. p. 156 Lindemann: Tifata iliceta. 2Hor. od.

Elsewhere.' he connects the name Fagutal with fagus, and speaks of a shrine of Jupiter Fagutalis as existing on the spot. There was also an ancient Dianium on the Fagutal.2 It seems clear, therefore, that Jupiter, and perhaps Diana before him, was worshipped on the Esqui- line as a beech-wood deity.3 Similarly on a hill called Corne near Tusculum there was an ancient cult of Diana in a grove of beech-trees.4 And, when Numa consulted Faunus in the oak-wood already mentioned, he bound his brows twice with a wreath of beech-leaves.5 Of the poplar as a surrogate for the oak 6 there are few, if any, traces in Italian cult. Egeria, the goddess-wife of Numa, bore a name which was once spelt Aegeria,7 and should probably be connected with a'tyetpor, " a poplar."8 But a''yelpog, as we have seen, originally denoted "an oak," and Egeria is described as an oak- 11 b. 152.

But in place of "Arcanumque Iovem " various scholars have read "Aegeriumque Iovem."'3 If this reading is sound, it affords an excellent parallel to &amp;Egeria, "the oak-goddess," since Jupiter at Praeneste was an oak-god." The nut-tree too, since like the oak and the beech it bore edible fruit, was connected with Jupiter in popular parlance. " Nuts," says Servius,5 "are under the protec- tion of Jupiter: wherefore also they are called iuglandes, that is Jupiter's acorns (lovis glandes)." It is probable that the Italians, like the Greeks,6 regarded oak-mistletoe as the quintessence of the oak, and so con- nected it with the most brilliant manifestation of the sky-god, i.e. with the sun. The sun seems to figure in Italian religion as the wheel or orb of Fortuna,7 who 1 Plut. de fort. Rom. 9 vvu/O^ov la'v 5pvd8wv. 2 Corp. inscrr. Lat. xiv. 2852, BUicheler Carm.

Now in Greece the solar wheel was referred to a special mistletoe-god, Ixion.2 When, therefore, at Rome we find a cult of Fortuna Viscata,3 Fortuna "of the Mistletoe," it becomes pro- bable that here too the sun was connected with oak- mistletoe. Again, Fortuna was a very ancient goddess of fertility,4 who is sometimes called the daughter of Jupiter.5 Fortuna with her wheel would thus be the Italian counterpart of Persephone with her wheel in the vase-paintings of the Greeks.6 Virgil, therefore, knew what he was about when he described the famous "golden bough" first as sacred to Juno of the nether world, whom in the context he calls Proserpina, and secondly as growing on an evergreen oak like mistletoe.7 I have next to show that in Italy, as in Greece,8 the reigning monarch was regarded as representative and vice- gerent of the sky-god. To begin with, two or three temple of Fors Fortuna was June 24 (Roscher Lex. i. 150I), i.e. the summer solstice, and concluded that Fortuna may be traced back to a solar deity (Etudes de Myth.

Several symbols of the goddess, the cornucopia, the modius or grain-measure, and the ears of corn (Roscher Lex. i. 1503 ff., 15O6), belong to one who was originally no mere personification of luck, but rather the bountiful spirit who brought to birth (Fortuna connected with fero) the offspring of all living things. 5Dessau 3684, 3685. 6 Preller-Robert, p. 805 n.

Thus Festus' says of Latinus, the eponymous king of the Latins, that "he vanished in a battle with Mezentius king of Caere, and was thought to have become Jupiter Latiaris." So too Aeneas, the founder of the Alban dynasty, disappeared in a battle with Mezentius or with Turnus, and was thenceforward worshipped under the title Jupiter Indiges.2 Romulus, according to the usual tradition, was caught up to heaven in a thunderstorm, but subsequently appeared in more than mortal beauty to Proculus Julius, and announced that he had become the god Quirinus,3 i.e. "the oak-god." Nor was it only after death that the early Italian king claimed the attri- butes of divinity. Ascanius, the son of Aeneas, who fortified Alba Longa, was surnamed lulus; 4 and Iulus means "young Jupiter." 5 The bright, but harmless flame, which is said to have played about his head, was appropriate to a representative of the sky-god: his grand- father on seeing it at once recognised the sign, and offered a prayer to Jupiter of the sky." Ascanius at his death left a son also called Iulus;7 and the poets speak of 1Fest. p. 193 Lindemann, cp. schol. Bob. in Cic. pro Planc. p. 256 Orelli. S Liv.

According to tradition, his son disputed the succession with Silvius, the son of Aeneas by Lavinia, "and to Iulus in place of the sovereignty a certain holy power and honour was given, preferable to the royal dignity both for security and for ease; and this his posterity enjoy down to the present time, being called Julii for him." 5 These words of Dionysius seem to record a genuine separation of the sacred from the secular functions of the Alban dynasty. Note, however, that Silvius and the line of Silvii who succeeded him,6 retained a cognomen suitable to representatives of a tree- god : Silvius means "he of the Forest." Moreover, since Virgil introduces them one and all as crowned with "civic oak,"' this tree-god must have been an oak-Jupiter.8 Romulus Silvius, the eleventh in descent, claimed the powers of Jupiter in a very practical way. Ovid 9 describes him as " Remulus ... mimick o' the thunderbolt"; and 1 Aus. epist. I6. 85 ff. ut quondam in Albae moenibus I supremus Aenea satus I Silvios lulis miscuit. 2Val. Flacc.

Dionysius,1 who calls him Alladius, says that "in con- tempt of the gods he contrived mock thunderbolts and noises like thunder, wherewith he thought to frighten men as though he were a god. But a storm fraught with rain and lightning falling upon his house, and the lake near which it stood swelling in an unusual manner, he was drowned with his whole family." Caeculus, the founder of Praeneste, where there was an oak-cult of Jupiter and Fortuna,2 had been conceived by his mother from a spark off the hearth, and proved his divine origin to an incredulous crowd by enveloping them with flame.3 Probably both Alladius and Caeculus, like Salmoneus in the Greek myth,4 claimed to be Jupiter incarnate. In the first edition of his Golden Bough Dr. Frazer suggested that the rex Nemorensis or king of Diana's Wood at Nemi personated an oak-Jupiter.5 This sugges- tion, I confess, at the time failed to convince me. But by way of support for it I pointed out," in a review of Dr. Frazer's second edition, that at Aquileia Jupiter actually bore the title Dianus; and at Aquileia, I may add, there was also a cult of Imperial Diana.8 Partly on the strength of this Jupiter Dianus Dr. Frazer amended his original suggestion, and towards the close of 1903 told me that, according to his revised theory, the partner of Diana at Nemi must have been Dianus or Janus, a collateral form of Jupiter. I am now satisfied that he was from the outset on the right track, and that a Dianus or Janus 1 Dionys. ant. Rom. I. 71. 2SSupra p. 280 f. 3 Serv. in Verg. Aen. 7. 678. 'Folk-lore xv. 300, 312.

The worship of a Jupiter Dianus (Janus) appears not only from an unfinished marble bust "probably intended to represent Jupiter,"1 which was found by Lord Savile in one of the shrines on the spot, but also from a very remarkable Janiform stele discovered in the same precinct. This stele, which is inscribed SACR DIAN (presumably " Sacred to Diana," though conceivably "Sacred to Dianus"), is described as follows in the official Catalogue2: it "consists of the head of a beardless young man, and of an elderly man with a flowing beard. Both have on their foreheads fishes' fins, looking like small wings, aquatic plants cover the neck and chest, and scales cover the cheeks of both heads; the head of the young man has a small fin at each angle of the mouth, the beard of the elder head seems saturated with water, and the long damp hair of both heads seems to be blown about in the wind. Etc." I take it that this stele portrays Dianus (Janus) as a water-god. Diana beside the lake of Nemi, which was called her " Mirror,"3 may well have been, as Th. Birt 4 conjectured, not only a goddess of the bright sky,5 but also a goddess of the bright reflecting water. And Dianus (Janus), whom Nigidius Figulus held 1G. H.

He was, it will be remembered, the mate of Juturna, the old Latin goddess of lakes and rivers.2 He was the father of Fontus,3 the god of springs and wells, whose Janiform head appears on coins of the gens Fonteia.4 He was the father also of the river Tiber, whose sacred oak is mentioned by Virgil,5 and of Canens the water-nymph, whom King Picus preferred to the Naiads of Nemi.6 It was said that, when the Sabines on one occasion attempted to force their way into Rome, a raging flood of waters burst out from the temple of Janus and drove them back.' All this and more8 goes to prove that an aquatic bust of Janus is far from being incredible.9 Moreover, that this god was 1 Supra p. 277 n.

I. 291. 8 Roscher Lex. ii. 41. 9In what relation to this watery Janus, it may be asked, did Diana's favourite Virbius stand ? Virbius is an ancient name of unknown origin, which appears on both sides of the Adriatic. According to Vibius Sequester (p. 20, 5 Oberlin) there was a river Virbius in Laconia and (ib. p. 22, 15) a spring Virvinus also in Laconia. These statements are supported by the name Ippos, which occurs as that of a mythical person connected with the cult of Artemis at Sparta (Paus. 3. 16. 9). Perhaps, then, Virbius in Italy, as in Greece, was an aboriginal stream-god, identified with the watery form of Janus. Note that Irbos was son of Amphisthenes and grandson of Amphicles (Paus. 3. 16. 9)-a pedigree well suited to a Janiform god; and that Janiform gods were not unknown in Laconia (Folk-lore xv. 284). The notion that Virbius meant "the man with two lives" (vir bis: Serv. in Verg. Aen. 7. 761) might easily arise from his representation with a Janiform head; and the statement that certain persons took Virbius to be the Sun (Serv. in. Verg. Aen. 7. 776) is intelligible in view of the fact that Janus as the partner of Diana was sometimes identified with that luminary (supra p. 277. n. I, Roscher Lex. ii. 44). A list of temple property found at Nemi includes a head of the Sun ; but this was probably a head of Jupiter Sol Sarapis (cp. Dessau 4395 if.), since the temples in question seem to have been those of Isis (Dessau 4423). In the Class. Rev. xvi. 373 I proposed to regard the Janiform head from Nemi as that of a river-god Virbius : I still think that view possible, provided</page><page sequence="32">The European Sky-God. 291 incarnate in the rex Nemorensis I should infer from the following considerations. Nemi was the religious centre of a Latin federation. When, therefore, we find that a certain Manius Aegerius 1 or Egerius Laevius of Tusculum, a Latin dictator at the head of this federation, dedicated a grove to Diana at Nemi,2 it becomes highly probable that the rex Nemorensis discharged the religious duties of the early Latin king, whose secular functions descended to the Latin dictator. In fact, I surmise that the separa- tion of divine and human offices, which took place at Alba, had taken place at Nemi also; and that, just as Iulus obtained "a certain holy power and honour .. . preferable to the royal dignity both for security and for ease,"3 so Virbius, the first king of the Wood, was "to live at his ease in the grove of Diana."4 Again, as the secular king of Alba retained the name Silvius, "he of the Forest," so the secular dictator that we identify Virbius with the water-Janus. Ov. met. 15. 539 f. makes Hippolytus say that when Diana transformed him into Virbius, she "added years to mine age and left me not a face that could be recognized." This description suits well the union of a youthful with an elderly head in our bust, and also the curious treatment of the two visages. If it be thought that the authority of Vibius Sequester, an uncritical compiler, is not enough to justify the foregoing conclusions, I should prefer (with Dr. Frazer) to connect Virbius and verbena. Verbena could denote the branch (ramus) of a sacred tree (Serv. in Verg. ecl. 8. 65, Aen. 12. 120), so that Virbius may have been ' He of the sacred branch.' Dr. Postgate has suggested to me that verber, if it meant originally ' switch,' belongs to the same group of words, referable to the root of viridis. The i of Virbius (sometimes written Verbius in the MSS. : see Class. Rev. xvi. 380 n. 3) might, he thinks, come in through the influence of vir and virgo. Which of these two theories is right, it is hard to say. We shall perhaps reach decisive considerations when we come to deal with the Celtic belief in vervain. 1Fest. p. 169 Lindemann. 2 Cato origg. 2. frag. 58 Peter. 3Dionys. ant. Rom.

I conceive that the Diana and Dianus, who, on Dr. Frazer's amended hypothesis, had a joint cult in an oak-grove beside the Lake of Nemi, may have been surnamed respectively Aegeria, "the oak-goddess," and Aegerius, "the oak-god": the former epithet, split off from Diana by a process familiar to students of ancient mythology, developed into the separate personality of Aegeria or Egeria, the oak-nymph; the latter epithet, borne by the Latin dictator, marks him as the temporal representative of Janus. Nay, more; for the man's name was also Manius, and from him arose a long line of illustrious Manii, a fact which occasioned the proverb multi Mani A riciae, "There is many a Manius at Aricia."1 Now an extant fragment of a Salian hymn 2 says of Janus: " duondis cerds es odnus " Thou alone art a good creator- and we have it on the authority of Festus3 that in a Salian hymn the phrase Cerus manus meant "good creator." Whether these translations are right or wrong,4 1 Fest. p. 169 Lindemann. 2Varr. de ling. Lat. 7. 26. I follow the text of Biihrens Frag. poet. Rom. p. 30. 8Paul. exc.

Zimmermann in Bezzenberger's Beitrdge zur Kunde der indogermanischen Sprachen 1899 xxv. 30 f. refers the praenomen Manius, the nomen Manius, the cognomen Manianus, and many other Latin names to mdnus, "good." W. M. Lindsay The Latin language p. 183 accepts "good" as the root-meaning of a whole group of words from the parallel stems maino- and mani- (mdnus, Mines, im-mdnis ? mane); and this was the view of Varr. de ling. Lat. 6. 4 and Macrob. Sat. I. 3. 13. On the other hand, if mane "morning" is to be dissociated from this group, and if Manius means " morning-born," as several ancient authorities declare (Varr. de ling. Lat. 9. 38, Paul. exc. Fest. p. 102 Lindemann, Auct. de praenominib. 6), it was still a suitable name for a representative of Janus, who bore the title "Morning Father" (Matutinus Pater) as a god of the brightening sky (Hor. sat. 2. 6. 2o and Acro ad loc.).</page><page sequence="34">The European Sky-God. 293 it is clear that manus was a ceremonial epithet of Janus. But if so, Manius may well be a derivative of the same applied to the Manii of Aricia' as the representatives of the old divine kings, who were in their day and generation reverenced as Janus incarnate.2 This con- jecture is materially strengthened by the fact that the first rex sacrorum at Rome was Manius Papirius.3 At this point I may be pardoned for a brief digression, which will help to clear up one of the most familiar but at the same time least intelligible of Italian beliefs. If the Man ii of Aricia were once regarded as successive incarnations of the sky-god called manus, and if we are to recognize the same word in Manes, the Latin term for ancestral ghosts or spirits,4 it seems probable that origin- ally the forefather of each clan was reverenced as a Jupiter and thought to be reincarnated in his descendants. This explains at once the use of the plural Manes as per- taining to an individual and the belief that these Manes were gods (di Manes). A man's Manes were, it would seem, the whole series of his ancestors who had each in 1It may be objected that the name Manius should have been borne by the rex Nemorensis rather than by the dictator of Aricia. I conceive that originally the two were one and the same; and that, when the division between sacred and profane duties took place, the name Manius was given to the secular leader in token of the religious position occupied by his predecessors. It is perhaps significant that the names Manlius, Manlia, which appear to be cognate with Manius (so Zimmermann loc. cit.) were borne by several persons in a like position elsewhere. Thus a rex sacrorum at Bovillae was named Manlius (Dessau 4942), a regina sacrorum at Rome Manlia (Dessau 3941, 3941 a), and probably another regina sacrorum at Tibur Manlia (Dessau 1043). 2 If I am right in equating Virbius with Janus (supra p. 29o n. 9), we obtain an additional argument for regarding the rex Nemorensis as an embodiment of Janus; for the first king of the Wood was named Virbius, as was also his son (Verg. Aen. 7. 761 ff.). 3Dionys. ant. Rom. 5. I. 4 Steuding in Roscher Lex. ii. 2318 ft. shows that the di Manes of Roman tombstones were "not the souls of the persons there buried, but ancestral spirits in general or the ancestral spirits of that family in particular."</page><page sequence="35">294 The European Sky-God. turn been regarded as Jupiter incarnate. To this series, when he came to die, he added his own genius or birth- god, the divine spirit transmitted to him at the moment of conception on the lectus genialis or bridal-bed. This appears not only from such dedications as a tombstone1 at Pola inscribed- MANIBVS I ET GENIO I P. VATRI * SEVERI To the Manes and Genius of P. Vatrius Severus, or a funeral lamp2 in the Museo Kircheriano painted with the words- Helenus : suom genio M(a)nib inferis I mandat ? stipem * strenam - lumen suom - secum * defert * ne quis ? eum I solvat nisi. nos - qui . legamus. Helenus commends his Genius to the Manes below. He brings down with him as contribution and gift his light. Let no man loose him but we who hind. but also from definite statements made by various classical authors. Thus Martianus Capella3 says: " Inasmuch as the Manes are assigned to bodies at the moment of con- ception, when life is over they still delight in these bodies and haunting them are called Lemures. If they are supported by the virtue of their past life, they become the Lares of households and towns. But if they are depraved by the body, they are spoken of as Larvae and Maniae." We are here told that the Manes are embodied at conception; in other words, that the ancestral spirits are reincarnated in their descendants, presumably as genii. Servius4 says much the same: "Some hold that the Manes are identical with the genii of antiquity; and that, as soon as the body is conceived, two Manes are assigned to it, which do not desert it even in death, but on the consumption of the body still inhabit its 1 Wilmanns Exemnpla inscrr.

But if the Manes before birth become genii, conversely the genii after death become Manes, who are further identified with the Lares or Larvae. According to Arnobius,l "Varro declares at one time that the Lares are Manes, and that consequently the mother of the Lares was named Mania, at another that they are the so-called gods of the air and heroes; or again, following ancient authorities, he says that the Lares are Larvae, being as it were the genii of the departed2 or souls of the dead." This identification of the genius with the Lar, i.e. with the Lar familiaris, who appears to have been the forefather of the family3 buried under the hearth,4 is indeed fairly well attested. Censorinus5 in- forms us that Granius Flaccus, a contemporary of Caesar, and many other writers held the genius and the Lar to be one and the same. Ausonius6 speaks of "the genius of our homes, to wit the Lar sprung from Larunda." And Ovid 7 describes December, the month of the Laren- talia, as " welcome to the genii." Lastly, Servius8 quotes 1Arnob. adv. nat. 3. 41. 2 The MSS. have " quasi quosdam genios effunctorum animas mortuorum." We should perhaps read "quasi quosdam genios defunctorum [animas mortu- orum]," the last two words being a gloss. For other emendations see Oehler ad loc. 3 Plaut. merc. 834 familiai Lar pater, cp.

A perusal of the foregoing passages certainly confirms us in the belief that the genius or birth-god comes from the Manes and returns to the Manes; in fact, that the genius of every man is but the reincarnation of an ancestor's genius. Moreover, it is highly probable that this genius was a Jupiter. To begin with, there is the important fact that in the case of a woman it was called her Juno.' Secondly, Caesius,2 who professed to follow Etruscan authorities, declared that the Penates were Fortuna, Ceres, the genius lovialis, and the masculine Pales: this genius lovialis is evidently a family god of some kind, and must not be confused with the genius Iovis of literature and inscrip- tions,3 who was merely the genius of an anthropomorphic Jupiter. Thirdly, Augustine4 expressly identifies the genius with Jupiter-a conclusion based on the general similarity between the functions of the genius and those of Jupiter progenitor. Fourthly, the nearest analogy to the word genius is offered by Fortuna Primigenia, the oak-goddess of Praeneste. The meaning of her title is disputed. Some5 take it to denote " Eldest-born"; and this is supported by two inscriptions, which certainly call 1 Roscher Lex. ii. 615 ff. 2Caesius ap. Arnob. adv. nat. 3. 40. A little further on (ib. 43) we read : "Ceres, Pales, Fortuna, Iovialis aut Genius." The Etruscan Tages is described as Genii filius, nepos lovis (Fest. s.v. "Tages" p. 273 Lind.). 3 Minuc. Fel.

The cult was singular, not to say unique. " Italy," says Mr. Warde Fowler,4 "presents us with no real parallel to this child-Jupiter"; and that he should have been conceived not only as a child but also as a father is still more mystifying. If, however, we may venture to interpret Primigenia as "First of the genii or birth-gods," we go some way towards reading the riddle, because every genius is from one point of view a father, from another a son. The infants Jupiter and Juno on the lap of Fortuna would, on this showing, be the typical male and female genii. The suggestion is strengthened by the constant coupling and occasional identification of Fortuna and Genius, or of Fortuna and Tutela (=female Genius), in inscriptions.5 Fifthly, there were but very few festivals in the Roman calendar sacred to Jupiter. One of these few was the Larentalia on December 23, which Ovid described as "welcome to the genii."6 Macrobius explains the connexion as follows: on this day the flamen (Quirinalis8) offered a solemn sacrifice to the Manes of Acca Larentia (the Mother of the Lares 9), and the occasion was sacred to Jupiter because "the ancients held that souls were given 1 Dessau 3684, 3685. 2See J.

Junius Brutus, the consul of 138 B.C., used to perform his family parentatio or funeral offerings not, as all other Romans did, in February, but in December.1 May not this have been the older system kept up in the family of one who claimed descent from Jupiter 2 ? Sixthly, the common representation of the genius as a snake3 suits Jupiter, who was known to appear as a snake on the lectus genialis.4 Seventhly, it explains the belief in a two-fold genius5; for, as Jupiter was the god now of the bright sky, now of the dark sky (Jupiter Summanus), so the genius was "changeable of aspect, white or black."6 But to all this it may be objected: if the genius was Jupiter, why is he never, except in the quasi-philosophic Augustine, called Jupiter? I suspect that the Romans refrained from mentioning their personal Jupiter from a fear lest others should work mischief with the name. The name of the tutelary god of Rome was never uttered for that reason, and Q. Valerius Soranus who divulged it came to a bad end.7 Servius8 mentions in this connexion that on the Capitol at Rome was a shield inscribed " To the Genius of the city of Rome, whether male or female," 1Cic. de leg. 2. 54, Plut. quaestt.

Serv. in Verg. Aen. I. 277, Plin. nat. hist. 3. 65 and Solin. I. 5 say that Valerius Soranus divulged the forbidden name of Rome; and Solinus explains (ib. I. I) that the name in question was Valentia. Lyd. de mens. p. 125, 5 Wiinsch asserts that the mystic name was "Epws, i.e. Amor. But both must be late inventions: Valentia is but a Latinized form of 'P T r1, and Amor is a palindrome for Roma. Macrob. Sat. 3. 9. 3 states that both the tutelary god of Rome and the Latin name of Rome itself were kept profound secrets, but does not attempt to disclose them. 8Serv. in Verg. Aen. 2. 351.</page><page sequence="40">The European Sky-God. 299 and that the pontiffs used to pray "Jupiter Optimus Maximus, or by what other name thou wouldst be called." This raises a suspicion that the Genius of Rome was the Capitoline Jupiter. And it is noteworthy that Augustine' quotes from Varro the one surviving couplet of the imprudent Valerius Soranus- " luppiter omnipotens regum rerumque deumque progenitor genetrixque deum, deus unus et omnes." Almighty Jupiter, father of kings and things And gods, yea mother of gods, whole god and sole.- the very couplet, it will be observed, which Augustine cited in support of his contention that the genius was Jupiter.2 However that may be, we are, I believe, justified in maintaining that the family genius, the godhead incar- nate in the founder of the clan, and passed on from father to son, was none other than Jupiter. Appuleius 3 speaks of "prayers addressed to Genius and Genita ": the former he describes as Manium deum4; the latter reappears in Plutarch 5 and Pliny6 as Genita Mana, a birth-goddess to whom dogs (the offering appropriate to the Lares Praestites7) were sacrificed in order that none of those born in the house might become manus, i.e. might die. In both cases the epithet adds weight to my conclusion that the deity incarnate was the sky-god who bore the old religious title manus.8 But it is time to resume the thread of our main argu- ment. At Rome too, as throughout Latium, there are 1 Aug. de civ. Dei 7. 9. 2Supra p. 296. 3Appul. de deo Socr. 687. 41d. ib. 689 nomine Manium deum nuncupant.

In the first place, Janus is said to have reigned as a king on the Janiculum,' which probably implies that the local king personated Janus and bore his name. A very ancient hymn of the Salii2 saluted Janus as "first and foremost of divine kings." And just as lulus, the human Jupiter of Alba Longa, founded the gens Julia, so the human Janus of the Janiculum may have founded the gens Diania and the gens Dianidia mentioned in Roman inscriptions.3 Now, a double Janus would be represented better by two kings than by one. It is, therefore, I venture to think, highly significant that there was a marked and persistent tendency towards a dual kingship both at Rome and elsewhere in Italy. My suggestion is that the two kings, twins if possible, were regarded as the most fitting embodiment of the two-fold sky-god.4 Procas, king of Alba, left his kingdom to his two sons Amulius and Numitor on condition that they should take it in turns to reign for a year 6-a rule that recalls on the one hand the alternate life of the Dioscuri,6 on the other the alternate office of the consuls.7 Romulus and Remus on coins of Rome,8 like the Dioscuri on coins of Greece,9 1Arnob. adv. nat. 3. 29, Macrob.

When the Tarquins were driven out, the same ancient principle reasserted itself and produced that characteristically Roman institution, the double consulship. There was a certain dramatic fitness in the legend that the battle of lake Regillus, at which the tyrant was finally beaten, was won for the consuls by the help of the great twin brethren Castor and Pollux. The duo- viri or highest magistrates in colonies and municipal towns throughout Italy, who sometimes bore the name of praetors,3 and once at least that of dictators,4 may have been in every case the political outcome of a concep- tion which was in its origin religious. The same belief possibly contributed to the later duplication of the Caesars: it is to be observed that the bisellium or honorary "seat for two" belonged to them in virtue of their divinity.5 The god thus represented by the Roman kings and by their republican and imperial successors was, we 1 Tradition called them the sons of Mars by Rhea Silvia: but this, as we shall see later (infra p. 320 f.), does not conflict with their relation to Jupiter. For the moment it may suffice to point out that they were found under the ficus Ruminalis or Rumina, and that the Romans worshipped a Jupiter Ruminus (Aug. de civ. Dei 7. II). On the fig-tree as a substitute for the oak of Jupiter see Folk-lore xv. 299 (Zeus XvKdatLo etc.). 2Serv. in Verg. Aen. I. 276. 3 Daremberg-Saglio Dict. des Ant. ii. 416 s.v.

Thus it was from Egeria, the oak-nymph, that Numa learnt how to control the thunderstorms of Jupiter Elicius.' Numa, the priestly king, husband of Egeria, may indeed have been looked upon as Jupiter incarnate. One of his earliest acts was to establish the cult of Jupiter Termi- nalis2: and M. Babelon remarks the close resemblance between the bust of Jupiter Terminalis on coins of the gens Terentia and the bust of Numa on coins of the gens Calpurnia-"c'est 6videmment la m~me tete et les memes traits."3 But the best proof that a Roman king was regarded as an oak-Jupiter lies in the nature of his regalia. A large gold crown of oak-leaves enriched with acorns of precious stones and golden ribands was worn by him4 as viceroy of the oak-god, while an ivory sceptre with an eagle perched upon it5 proclaimed the human Jupiter." His throne was hollowed out of a tree stump.y The fasces borne before him by the lictors consisted in each case of an axe bound up in a bundle of rods and fastened with a strap of red leather.8 It is probable that the axe was the symbol of Jupiter,9 and that the rods were used for purposes of divination10: both, no doubt, came to be regarded as means of punishment, but their primary significance appears to have been religious, not secular. The first Roman consuls were doubtless chosen with the utmost care, in order that the kings as representatives 1Supra p. 269. 2Plut. vit. Num. I6, Dionys. ant.

The two candidates selected were L. Junius Brutus and L. Tar- quinius Collatinus. Apart from their other qualifications, these two bore well-omened names. For Junius means "the son of Jupiter,"' and his colleague was the son of Egerius, "the oak-man." 2 It is also noteworthy that, when Junius had fallen in battle the same year, the consul elected in his room was Sp. Lucretius Tricipitinus, whose name suggests the god of light (lux, cp. Lucetius) in his early three-headed (triceps) form. Other members of the same family succeeded him: T. Lucretius Tricipi- tinus was consul in 508 B.C. and again in 504 B.c.; L. Lucretius Tricipitinus, in 462 B.C.; Hostus Lucretius Tricipitinus, in 429 B.c. Further, L. Tarquinius Colla- tinus, though he was the son of Egerius, yet bore the ill-starred name Tarquinius; and it was, according to Livy,3 precisely on account of his name that he was forced to abdicate and go into exile. In his place the people elected P. Valerius, who bore a well-omened name, and came of a family which, as Niebuhr4 suggests, may have exercised kingly power over the Sabines at an early date. Time after time during the republican era Rome witnessed a recrudescence of this desire to find a Jupiter in her popular heroes. The most remarkable case of it is perhaps that of P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major. The people were anxious to make him "perpetual consul 1C.

Indeed, it appears that a portrait of Scipio was actually set up in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and fetched thence whenever it was needed for a funeral procession of the gens Cornelia.2 Scipio never undertook any business, whether public or private, without first resorting to this temple, where he remained for long sunk in contempla- tion: hence the populace came to believe that he was in reality of divine origin.3 Denarii of the gens Cornelia 4 represent on the obverse a helmeted head of Scipio sur- mounted by a star-a symbol of divinity which we have met with already: the reverse shows Jupiter with sceptre and thunderbolt standing between Juno, who has a sceptre, and Minerva, who is placing a wreath or crown upon his head. The latter design is meaningless, unless we assume that Jupiter stands for the victorious Scipio. Another denarius of the same gens 6 has Jupiter with sceptre and uplifted thunderbolt driving a four-horse chariot over a snaky giant, the blank spaces of the sky being filled with the sun, moon, and a couple of stars. M. Babelon, following Cavedoni, holds that Jupiter here denotes Scipio's brother, L. Cornelius Scipio Asiagenus triumph- ing over Antiochus the Great, King of Syria. A denarius 6 struck half-a-century later by another L. Cornelius Scipio 1 Liv. 38. 56. 12 f., Val. Max. 4. I. 6. 2Val. Max. 8. 15. I, App. de reb. Hisp. 23.

Babelon, refers to the same event. When Cicero1 speaks of Gnaeus and Publius Scipio, who fell in Spain, as " the two thunderbolts of our empire "; when Lucretius 2 terms Scipio Major "a thunderbolt of war"; when Virgil and Silius, in imitation of him, call Scipio Major and Scipio Minor " the two thunderbolts of war " and "the thunder- bolts of our race" ; 3 when Valerius Maximus,4 recording the degeneracy of Scipio's son, exclaims "Gracious gods! Ye suffered this thunderbolt to issue in utter obscurity! ", they may be, as Mr. H. A. J. Munro5 conjectured, taking the name Scipio to mean "a thunderbolt" (a-Kr7T4r-d), but they may also have been appealing to the primitive senti- ment of the Roman people, which identified the hero of the moment with Jupiter himself. Again, Manius Acilius Glabrio, who as consul in 191 B.c. had won a great victory over Antiochus III., not only celebrated the customary triumph on his return to Rome, but was subsequently honoured as more than a mere man. For his son erected a statue of him covered with gold, the first of its kind in Italy.6 Another member of the same family, Manius Acilius Balbus, took part in the defeat of Perseus, king of Macedonia-an exploit commemorated on coins7 of his son, which show him standing as Jupiter in a four- horse chariot. He holds a sceptre in his left hand, and a thunderbolt in his right; while his chariot is driven 1 Cic. pro. Balb. 34. 2Lucr. 3. 1034- 3Verg. Aen. 6. 842 f., Sil. 7. io6 f. 4Val. Max. 3. 5.

Possibly the name Manius, which constantly occurs in this ancient family, implies that its members regarded themselves as incarnations of Janus or Jupiter. The populace dubbed Marius after his victory over the Cimbrians in 10I B.C. the third founder of Rome, erected statues to him wholesale, and in their private rejoicings offered incense and libations " to the gods and Marius." 1 He fell in with their humour, and subsequently made a point of using a cantharus for his drinking-vessel in order that he might be compared with Father Liber,2 i.e. Jupiter Liber.3 Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius, when he once gained a victory over Sertorius in Spain, was proclaimed imperator and received with altars and sacrifices wherever he went. He accepted sumptuous entertainments, at which he sat drinking in triumphal robes, i.e. in the costume of Jupiter.4 Suddenly a mechanical figure of Victory would descend from the ceiling amid the sound of rolling thunder, bring- ing a golden trophy or a crown for his "celestial head," while choruses of women and children chanted epinician hymns.5 Nor must we hastily accuse Metellus of blas- phemy: indeed he was pontifex maximus in 65 B.C., and retained the office till his death. It was but another example of the great man claiming to be a greater than man. Pompey in like manner was marked as a hero by his surname Magnus: but, perhaps because his family was of plebeian origin, we find him identified with Janus, not Jupiter. On a first-brass of his son Sex. Pompeius Magnus6 occurs a laureated head of Janus with the features of Pompey the Triumvir. It may be surmised that these sporadic examples of 1 Plut. vit.

For instance, the gens Iuventia of Tusculum, Ioventia' or Iuentia2 as it was sometimes spelt,-must have traced its descent from a Jupiter.3 Moreover, in Campania a whole series of [uvilas or heraldic columns has been found, one of them expressly dedicated to Jupiter Flagius and many others erected within a precinct of Juno Lucina.4 These columns, marked with the armorial bearings of this or that family, represent -if I am right in my conjectures--the ancestor of the family in his character as a human Jupiter. However that may be, it is certain that the Roman who so dis- tinguished himself in war as to deserve the honour of a triumph acted for the time being the part of Jupiter Capitolinus. "The general," says Mr. G. Mc. Neile Rushforth,6 "appeared in the procession in the character of the god. His dress was the same, and it was the property of the temple, and brought thence for the occasion. So, too, the golden crown [of oak-leaves] and the sceptre with its eagle belonged to the god; the body of the general was, in early times at least, painted red like that of the image in the temple; and the white chariot horses used by the emperors, and earlier by Camillus, recalled the white steeds of Jupiter and the Sun." Another crown of oak-leaves and acorns was the corona civica given to the man who had slain an enemy and rescued a fellow-citizen from him. It was originally of holm-oak (ilex), but later of evergreen-oak (aesculus)- that being the tree specially sacred to Jupiter-or of 1Bull. epigraph. 1884 p. 112 loventia Victoria. 2G.

Once won, it might be always worn; and it conferred various rights on the wearer- e.g. at the public games even senators stood up to do him honour.1 Probably the citizen who wore the oak-crown of Jupiter2 was, like the triumphator, regarded as in some sort a Jupiter incarnate. Again, a Roman magistrate who contracted a treaty seems to have posed as Jupiter. "The reason," says Servius,3 " why the sceptre is used when a treaty has to be made is this. Our forefathers on all such occasions were wont to produce an image of Jupiter. This was difficult, especially when the treaty was made with a distant tribe. A way out of the difficulty was for them to hold a sceptre and so copy, as it were, the image of Jupiter; for the sceptre is peculiar to himself." It would seem, then, that even in republican times the latent belief in a human Jupiter made itself felt on various occasions and in various ways. When the republic passed into an empire, this belief gathered fresh force from the altered political circumstances of the day. More and more the emperor came to be looked upon as the one human Jupiter-indeed, as the one Jupiter worthy of the name, whether on earth or elsewhere. The whole subject of emperor-worship has been so carefully studied by M. I'Abbd Beurlier 4 that I shall content myself with indicat- ing those cases in which the emperor was definitely identified with Jupiter in particular. First and foremost is the case of Julius Caesar, who claimed descent from Iulus and was probably aware that the blood of Jupiter ran in his veins. At least, as early as 68 B.C., when he was a simple quaestor, he proclaimed in the course of a funeral oration that on his father's 1 Plin. nat. hist. 16. II ff. 2 Plut. quaestt. Rom. 92, vii.

Twenty years later, after the victory of Pharsalus, the senate decreed that Caesar's chariot should be set up on the Capitol opposite to that of Jupiter, and that a statue of him standing upon a globe should bear the inscription-" He is a demigod" (qpl[8eoI).2 Caesar at first disapproved of these flatteries, and even had the obnoxious word effaced.3 But not long afterwards an ivory statue of him, and subsequently a complete chariot, was carried in procession along with the statues of the gods, while another statue of him inscribed deo invicto (O8e aVIwK7r-p) was set up in the temple of Quirinus, and a third on the Capitol beside the old kings of Rome.4 Soon he was actually worshipped under the title of Jupiter Julius and provided with M. Antonius as his priest (flamen Dialis)5--a most singular instance of history repeating itself; for we have seen that the Julii of yore were human Jupiters. Caesar was, as a later tragedian 6 puts it, "become the peer of Jove." The honours decreed to him were recorded in letters of gold on tablets of silver and deposited beneath the feet of Jupiter Capitolinus.7 How far he believed in them himself, it is hard to say. When Antonius saluted him as King and placed a laurelled diadem on his head, Caesar replied that Jupiter alone was king of Rome and sent the diadem to the Capitol:8 but this may have been a matter of policy.

The great comet (Halley's), which for seven nights after Caesar's death glittered in the sky,2 contributed not a little to confirm the official apotheosis in the minds of the people at large. Octavius set up a bronze statue of Caesar with a star above his head in the temple of Venus.3 The temple of Divus Julius appears on a coin with a star affixed to its pediment.4 Numismatic busts, bas-reliefs, and statues were all distinguished by the same emblem, till the lulium sidus or Caesaris astrum passed into a poetic commonplace.5 Caesar had shown the way: Augustus, though with some apparent hesitation, followed it. Since the r61le of Jupiter had already been taken by Caesar, he took that of Apollo. A statue of him under the guise of this god was erected in the famous Library of the Palatine Apollo.6 Popular report said that he gave private banquets at which a dozen diners appeared dressed as the twelve gods and goddesses, the costume of Apollo being reserved for him.7 Hence in time of famine people spoke of him as Apollo Tortor, "Apollo the Torturer."8 Augustus did more to foster the cult of Apollo than any Roman before or after him; and it has been suggested 9 that in so doing he 1 Dessau 72 Genio deivi Iuli parentis patriae, quem senatus populus- que Romanus in deorum numerum rettulit, 6343 M.

Horace 3 speaks of Jove as thundering in heaven, of Augustus as his visible vicegerent on earth.

After this one does not wonder that a bronze medallion of Tiberius struck at Turiaso in Spain shows Augustus with radiated head grasping a thunderbolt as though he were Jupiter."

An eagle hovering round his head in the Campus Martius was regarded by him as an omen; 2 and when his body was burnt in the same Campus an eagle was let loose from the pyre to carry his soul heaven- wards,3 and an old praetor declared on oath that he had seen the soul of Augustus rise into the sky.4 The great sardonyx cameo of La Sainte Chapelle shows Augustus with a veil and rayed crown on his head, a sceptre in his hand, upborne by a figure in Phrygian attire, perhaps representing Ascanius Iulus: enthroned below him is the emperor Tiberius, identified with Jupiter by means of the aegis spread upon his lap.5 On the yet finer cameo at Vienna known as the " gemma Augustea" Augustus with sceptre, eagle, etc., is enthroned as Jupiter, while a female figure, probably Oecumene, the " World," holds an oak- wreath above his head." Augustus' wife Livia, who long survived him, is called on Greek coins " the goddess Livia " or " Livia Juno "; ~ and Prudentius8 speaks of Juno the wife of Jupiter and Livia as " the two Junos." But, since Juno was sister as well as wife of Jupiter, the author of the tragedy Octavia 9, addresses his heroine as " second Juno, sister and spouse of Augustus." Caligula translated the poetic fiction into fact, committed incest with his sisters, and called himself Jupiter on the strength of it.lo He assumed the title Optimus Maximus, 1 Suet.

He had a famous Greek statue of Olympian Zeus brought to Italy, intending to replace its head by a head of himself.1 When the ship conveying it perished in a thunderstorm, Caligula resolved to have thunder of his own. He had a bolt constructed, which could be launched by artificial means,2 and used to brandish his toy, calling himself Jupiter and giving oracles from an elevated throne.3 He was also saluted as Jupiter Latiaris.4 His downfall was predicted by various prodigies. A statue of Jupiter at Olympia, which he had meant to convey to Rome, burst into a sudden laugh and scared away the workmen: whereupon a certain Cassius came up and declared that he had been warned by a dream to sacrifice a bull to Jupiter. Caligula himself, the night before Cassius Chaerea stabbed him, "dreamed that he stood in heaven before the throne of Jupiter, and that, kicked by the toe of his right foot, he was hurled down to earth."" Almost the last word he spoke was when one of the conspirators asked him for his watchword and he replied "Jupiter."' Other emperors may be dismissed more shortly. A cameo in the Marlborough cabinet shows Claudius as Jupiter with thunderbolt, sceptre, and eagle all complete.7 L. Junius Silanus was done to death, if we may believe Seneca,s simply because he dubbed his sister Juno, and so presumably might be regarded as a rival of the emperor.

He adopted the name Iovius, which, to judge from contemporary literature and inscriptions, was popularly applied to him as the representative of Jove. " He specially adored this divinity," says Duruy,2 "whose name was the beginning of his own [sc. Dio-cletianus]; he placed the figure of Jupiter upon his coins; . . he built him a temple in the palace of Salona, and made it his study to appear in public ceremonies with the calm majesty of the father of gods and men." I need not cite further details. It must be already clear that from Julius Caesar onwards the emperors of Rome were constantly treated as Jupiter incarnate. One notice- able symbol of their godhead was the oak-wreath. Coins of the gens Julia3 show the head of Pietas crowned with oak; and Pietas was equivalent to Julius Caesar, as we see from a gold coin of the same gens, which portrays a veiled head of Pietas with the features of Caesar.4 Over the door of Augustus and his successors an oak-wreath was regularly suspended by decree of the Senate.5 And the general impression produced on the public by the sight of the emperor's palace may be gathered from Ovid'so couplet: " This is the house of Jupiter," quoth I, Taking my cue from yonder wreath of oak.

Now the early Greek king, in his office as human Zeus, controlled the sun, the rain, and the crops. The same is true of his Italian counterpart. Every year on the 2Ist of April the Romans celebrated the festival of the Parilia,1 at which they leaped over bonfires probably as a charm to procure sunshine.2 The day was regarded as the birthday of Rome itself, and it was said that Romulus had offered the original sacrifice and arranged the details of the ritual.3 Mr. Warde Fowler4 infers that the sacrificing priest at the urban Parilia was the rex sacrorum, a religious representative of the old Roman king. Certainly it was he who on the kalends of each month, as soon as the new moon was observed in the sky, offered a sacrifice to Juno and summoned the people to the Curia Calabra adjoining the hut of Romulus on the Capitol in order to announce to them when the nones would fall due.5 He thus appears to have furnished the people with both sunshine and moonshine. The ruins of his house, the Regia, show in the centre of the main apartment a circular base of grey tufa,6 which may have been the royal hearth. And close to the Regia stood the temple of Vesta, where the Vestal virgins watched their undying flame. The perpetual fire thus maintained under the eye of the king was, if I am right,7 simply a means of keeping up the sun's heat by mimetic magic. The human Jupiter was responsible for the sunlight. When Romulus vanished, the sun was 1 W. Warde Fowler The Roman Festivals p. 79 ff. 2W. Mannhardt Wald- und Feldkulte p. 517. 3Dionys. ant. Rom. I. 88. 4W. Warde Fowler op. cit. p. 83, n. I. 5 Macrob.

The rayed crown worn by Augustus and Claudius after death, by Nero and his successors during their lifetime, was the visible emblem of the sun-god, and was certainly borrowed from representa- tions of that deity.3 Before the birth of Augustus his father Octavius dreamt that a sunbeam issued from the womb of his mother Atia. At a later date he dreamt again that he saw his son in a laurelled chariot drawn by twelve white horses: he was of superhuman size and adorned with a rayed crown, a thunderbolt, a sceptre, and the garments of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. One night the infant Augustus vanished, and next day was found on the top of a high tower over against the sunrise.4 Commodus too aped the sun-god. "His hair," says Herodian,5 "was by nature yellow and curly, so that whenever he walked in the sunlight there flashed from it a gleam as of fire, and some supposed that he was powdered with gold dust on his way, while others regarded him as a god, affirming that a heavenly light shone about his head." A small bronze coin of Carus shows face to face the radiate head of the emperor and the radiate head of the sun-god.6 This conception of the emperor as a solar power may account for the fact that the Antonines and their successors used to have perpetual fire carried in front of them wherever they went.' 1Cic. de rep.

The early Italian king was also a rain-maker. Alladius made his mock-thunderstorms till he was destroyed by a real one.' Aeneas, according to one authority,2 disappeared in a thunderstorm, as did Romulus after him.3 Numa learnt from Jupiter Elicius how to control thunderstorms : Tullus Hostilius, who had imperfectly mastered Numa's formulae, attempted to do the same, but was thunderstruck himself by Jupiter.4 The pretensions of later Romans to wield the thunderbolt we have already considered. The king, who provided the weather, was presumably responsible for the crops. His palace, the Regia, con- tained a shrine of Ops,5 an ancient goddess of fertility; and modern excavations have brought to light a large silo or corn-pit in the king's courtyard.6 Possibly the corn- distributions of which we hear so much in republican and imperial times had their origin in a long-standing right of the people to be fed by their king. In Italy, as in Greece,7 the judicial and military duties of the king were closely bound up with his position as representative of the sky-god. The king, like Jupiter, was allowed to ride in a chariot within the walls of Rome; and from the chariot he appears to have pronounced his judg- ments. A denarius of the gens Vettia shows a man holding a sceptre, who stands in a two-horse chariot : he is inscribed IVDEX, the "judge," and behind him is placed a large ear of corn. Cavedoni and Mommsen took this personage to be king Numa engaged in distributing corn- fields: Babelon sees in him Sp. Vettius, who was interrex or temporary king after the death of Romulus.8 In any case it is probable that he delivered his verdicts from a chariot as the vice-gerent of Jupiter.

The king or general, if successful in battle, erected on the spot a trophy, i.e. an 1 Cp. Gell. 3. 18. 3 f., Paul. exc. Fest. s.v . " currules" p. 38 Lind., Isid. origg. 20. I I.

A remarkable analogy to the early Roman eagle is afforded by the later labarum, i.e. the military standard adorned with the Constantinian monogram. There can be little doubt that this monogram was an adaptation of an older solar symbol, and that it was as acceptable to the Mithraic worshippers as to the Christians (W. Lowrie Christian Art and Archaeology p. 238 ff.). It is at least possible that the much-disputed word labarum should be connected with Xd3pvs, the " double-axe," which symbolised the sky-god in the Aegean area from a very remote past (E. Conybeare Roman Britain p. 228 n. 2). 9 Pauly-Wissowa ii. 317.</page><page sequence="61">320 The European Sky-God. oak-trunk covered with votive armour,1 and on his return to Rome triumphed in the character of the oak-Jupiter.2 A difficulty here occurs. For the trophy, which the Greeks describe as " an image of Zeus,"3 was by the Romans connected with Mars rather than with Jupiter ;4 and the sacred spear kept in the Regia was deemed " an image of Mars" and addressed as "Mars." 5 This diffi- culty, however, is only apparent. I have elsewhere6 maintained that Mars was but a specialised form of Jupiter. His name Mars or Ma-vors means, according to Corssen, Bezzenberger, and Solmsen,7 the " Battle-turner," so that he would correspond in function to the Greek Zeus Tropaios8 or the Oscan Jupiter Versor.9 As Jupiter Stator was the god who "stayed" the Romans from flight,xo so Jupiter Mavors may have been the god who "routed" their foes. The evolution of Mavors as a separate deity can be precisely paralleled by that of Ares, a Thracian development of Zeus Areios.11 Some of the most important cult-titles of Mars were born by Jupiter also. Thus throughout the Celtic area Mars is surnamed Loucetius or Leucetius; 12 and we have already seen that Loucetius or Lucetius was an ancient Italian synonym of Jupiter." Again, Mars was identified with Quirinus,4 the "oak "-god; and Jupiter himself was sometimes called 1Verg. Aen. 11. 5 ff. 2 Supra p. 307. 3 Folk-Lore xv. 373 n. 25. 4 Verg. Aen.

The wood- pecker, associated with Zeus on Greek soil4 and with Jupiter in Italy,5 was more commonly regarded as the bird of Mars.6 These are among the reasons which have led me to suppose that Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus, the great triad of gods standing at the head of Roman religion and served by the "major priests" (flamines maiores), were but differentiated forms of one and the same deity- the sky-god who was at once the "Bright-father," the " Battle-turner," and the "Oak "-god. When the Salii are described as being "under the protection of Jupiter Mars Quirinus";7 when Decius devotes himself to death with a solemn prayer commencing "Janus, Jupiter, Mars pater, Quirinus"8; when Numa ordains that the first spolia opima should be presented to Jupiter Feretrius, the second to Mars, the third to Quirinus,9-we seem to witness successive stages in the evolution of this divine triad. The king who personated the warlike oak-Jupiter must needs be a great warrior. Some of the ancients, who saw a little way but not very far into their own past, held that Romulus was called Quirinus because he had been presented with a quiris or oaken spear on account of his valour in war.'0 The custom of thus rewarding martial prowess deserves more attention than it has received. It was, I believe, no mere decoration like those of modern times, but rather the bestowing of the sceptre in which the godhead was believed to reside: the man who so I Supra p. 281 n. 9. 21b. n. 8. 3 Preller-Jordan, i. 335. 4Folk-Lore xv. 387 n. 88, Class.

In favour of this surmise is the fact that the spear awarded for valour was called hasta pura and had no head to it. As represented on coins of the gens Arria it draws from M. Beurlier1 the exclamation: "It is more like a sceptre than a weapon." Virgil with equal art and lore makes Silvius, the "wood- land" king, son of Ascanius Iulus, the " oak-Jupiter," lean on a headless spear.2 Now in dealing with the Greeks I took occasion to illustrate Dr. Frazer's thesis that the divine king must be put to death as soon as his physical strength decays." The best Italian example is of course that upon which Dr. Frazer himself has laid stress, the case of the king of Nemi, who reigned as a strong man armed till a stronger than he came and slew him. But it may not be amiss to point out that there are other traces of the same custom to be detected here and there in Latin literature. In the Casina of Plautus Olympio,4 a country slave, thus accosts his master, Lysidamus: Ol. Your love-intrigue means hate galore for me.

The passage gains immensely in point if, as I cannot but think probable, it refers to the slave who reigned as human Jupiter at Nemi or to others of his class. What the bad end was to which they came, we do not exactly know; but we should gather from analogy that they were beheaded and their heads hanged on the sacred oak.' The decapitation of a would-be immortal was a subject not unsuited to ancient satire; and we have it on the authority of Tertullian that "Varro, the Roman Cynic, introduces scores of Joves or Jupiters minus their heads " and that Roman audiences laughed aloud when in the course of a mime " the last will and testament of a defunct Jupiter was read." 2 Varro's notion of a Jupiter minus his head may serve to explain a somewhat difficult passage in Seneca's brilliant satire The Pumpkinzfication of the divine Claudius.3 The scene is laid in heaven, and the gods are debating what sort of divinity shall be conferred upon Claudius, who has just issued a public order for the beheading of Febris, and demanded apotheosis for himself. One of them, apparently Jupiter, says: " He can't be the Epicurean god who 'troubleth no man and is himself untroubled of any.' The Stoic god, then? But how can he be 'rotund,' as Varro puts it,' minus his head, minus his tail' ? Ah, I see, 1 See Class. Rev. xvii. 269 ff. The heads of unsuccessful combatants were hanged on the oak of king Phorbas (Philostr. imagg. 2. 19. 2) and decorated the palaces of king Sitho (Nonn. Dion. 48. 224 f.) and king Oenomaus (Apollod. epit. 2. 5, Philostr. jun. imagg. 9. 3), both of whom were probably oak-kings. On Italian soil we have the myth of the "heads and a man" demanded from the Pelasgians by the oak-Zeus of Dodona (Dionys. ant. Rom. I. 19), and of the "heads" required from king Numa in the oak-wood by Jupiter Elicius (Plut. vit. Num. 15, cp. Class. Rev. xvii. 270, xviii. 369). The practice of hanging human faces (oscilla) on sacred trees points in the same direction. A Lucanian vase shows one suspended from a tree, beneath which two men with swords are engaged in a mortal combat (S. Reinach Rdq. des vases peints i. 486). 2Tert. apol. 14, 15. 3 Sen. apocoloc. 8.

Assuredly, if he had craved this boon (of divinity) from Saturn, whose festive month he kept going the whole year round, our Saturnalian prince, he wouldn't have got it; and he certainly shall not from Jupiter, whom to the best of his ability he condemned on a charge of incest." Now Dr. Frazer has shown that originally the king of the Saturnalia, after personating Saturn for a month, was put to death in this capacity, and that the Christian soldier Dasius, who refused to play the part of the heathen god, was actually beheaded at Duros- tolum as late as 303 A.D.1 The foregoing extract from Seneca not only contains a manifest allusion (the one in Latin literature) to the slaying of the Saturnalian king, but also describes the enfeebled Claudius' pretensions to be Jupiter2 with a sly reference to Varro's "Jupiters minus their heads," and so raises a presumption that the human Jupiter was normally beheaded in his dotage. Doubtless there were other methods of superannuating the effete king. Livy,3 after giving the usual tradition that Romulus disappeared in a thunderstorm, mentions the "very obscure tale" that he was torn to pieces by the hands of the fathers. Plutarch4 too, though persuaded that Romulus was caught up to heaven, records the belief that the senators had fallen upon him in the temple of Vulcan and divided his body between them, every man carrying away a portion of it in his robe. Dionysius 5 says much the same, though he makes the senate-house the scene of the murder, and adds that those who carried away the king's flesh in their garments buried every man his fragment in the earth. This singular variant recalls 1Frazer Golden Bough 2 iii. 140 ff. 2Supra p. 313. 3Liv. I. 16. 4. 4 Plut. vit. Rom. 27. 5 Dionys. ant.

In such cases it is, of course, the crude and ugly tale that is the better founded; and I sadly fear that the story of Romulus being rapt away in a thunderstorm was a pious fiction designed to conceal a far more horrible fate. Two other early kings, Aeneas and Latinus, vanished in like manner; and it is highly significant that each of them was identified after his death with Jupiter.2 In the case of Aeneas, side by side with the euphemistic statement that he had been translated heavenwards in a thunderstorm, there was a substantial tradition that he had been drowned in the river Numicius, on whose banks he was offering a sacrifice.3 Very possibly the sacrifice in question was the sacrifice of himself. Again, Titus Tatius was said to have gone with Romulus to Lavinium, in order to attend a certain sacrifice incumbent upon the kings, and there to have been set upon by the comrades and relatives of some murdered Laviniate envoys and slain by them "upon the altar with the sacrificial knives and spits."4 It would seem, then, that the Italians, no less than the Greeks, safeguarded the physical competence of their 1 Pind.

Pelias too was cut to pieces and boiled by his daughters, who had been told by Medea that they might thus restore to their father his youthful vigour (Roscher Lex. iii. 1848 ff.)-a circumstance which throws a flood of light on the motive of all these ritual murders and well accords with the theory propounded by Dr. Frazer (Golden Bough 2 ii. 5 f.). 2Supra p. 286. 3Tib. 2. 5. 43 f., Serv. in Verg.

Dr. Frazer kindly drew my attention to this passage; and further suggests that the death of Metius Fuffetius, the dictator of Alba, who at the bidding of Tullus Hostilius was torn asunder by a couple of two-horse chariots (ib. 3. 30), bears some resemblance to the death of Hippolytus-Virbius, who was "furiis direptus equorum" (Ov. fast. 3. 265).</page><page sequence="67">326 The European Sky-God. human Jupiters by putting them to death on the approach of old age. This custom furnishes a clue to the curious ritual of the argei at Rome.' On May 15 every year bundles of rushes resembling men bound hand and foot were taken down to the old Sublician Bridge by the pontiffs and praetors, and were thence cast into the river by the Vestal virgins. Tradition explained the rite by saying that old men, sixty years of age, used to be flung from the bridge as a sacrifice-witness the proverb sezagenarios de ponte-though authorities differed as to the god thereby propitiated: some thought Saturn,2 some Dis Pater.3 Now one of the most remarkable features of the occasion is that the flaminica Dialis, or priestess of Jupiter, who usually wore bridal attire, had to be present with dishevelled hair and signs of mourning.4 But, as Mr. Warde Fowler points out, no mention is made of the flamen, her husband-a significant omission! I conclude that the sezagenarius originally thrown from the bridge5 was the superannuated flamen Dialis, who during the years of his vigour and maturity had been a worthy representative of Jupiter, but on reaching the age of sixty must be done to death lest by his bodily decline he should imperil the divine potency resident in him. Like Aeneas he must be drowned in the river before reaching senility.6 Indeed, it is not improbable that the office of flamen Dialis was instituted precisely in order that the said flamen might take upon himself the numerous taboos and unpleasant restrictions7 (death by drowning 1 See Warde Fowler Roman Festivals p. IIi ff. 2 Ov. fast. 5. 627, though he ascribes the institution of the rite to " oracular Jupiter " (ib. 626) ; Dionys. ant. Rom. I. 38. 3 Fest. s.v. " sexagenarios " p. 259 Lind. 4 Gell. 10.

It is to be noted that Romulus and Titus Tatius are the only Roman kings of whose sacri- ficial death there is any evidence; and that the first appointment of a flamen Dialis is commonly ascribed to their immediate successor Numa, who provided that he should wear magnificent apparel and sit on the royal seat.' He was thus an obvious substitute for the king himself, and at a banquet none save the rex sacrorum, or priestly king, might take precedence of him.2 Romulus and Titus Tatius stand for the old r6gime which was mitigated and modified by degrees.3 At first the king seems to have been liable to an attack at any moment: the king at Nemi, for example, went about with a drawn sword in his hand and the thought of death always before him. Next, such murderous assaults were limited to one day in the year. It is probable that the Roman king ruled as it were on sufferance from year to year, and that -once in the twelvemonth he had to prove his powers undiminished by defending himself or being prepared to defend himself against a personal assailant. This can be inferred with much likelihood from a later usage. Once a year the Vestal virgins came to the rex sacrorum and addressed him in words of solemn significance: "Art thou watching, king? Watch! "4 Lastly, the fitness of the king to reign was yet more carefully ensured, when his tenure of office was reduced to a single year5 and his person duplicated by the creation of a second consul. If in times of emergency the consuls were superseded and the 1 Liv. I. 20. 2, Dionys. ant. Rom. 2. 64. 2Gell. 10. 15. 21, Fest. s.v. " ordo " p. 189 Lind. 3 Cp. Folk-Lore xv. 392 ff. 4 Serv. in.

" The election," says Mr. A. H. Greenidge,3 "was regarded as free in a far wider sense than the election of the higher magistrates at Rome; since, if we are to trust the traditional accounts, Roman citizenship was not a necessary qualification for the monarchy. Thus the non-burgess Numa, the foreigner Tarquin, the slave's son Servius, are all represented as having been elected kings of Rome." There is, indeed, only one principle wide enough to cover these very diverse claimants, viz. that of physical superiority. And it was precisely on that principle that king succeeded to king at Nemi: as Ovid puts it- regna tenent fortes manibus pedibusque fugaces.4 The strong of hand, the fleet of foot there rezign. Can the same custom be traced at Rome? On July 5 every year the Romans celebrated the old and obscure festival called the Poplifugia. It must have been at one time a festival of great importance, since, as Mr. Warde Fowler points out, no other festival falling before the Nones of the month is marked in large capitals on the Roman calendars. Two stories were told to account for the name. One of these connected it with the flight of the Roman army from the men of Fidenae after the retirement of the Gauls from Rome; but this Mr. Fowler at once dismisses on the ground that the Poplifugia must have been far older than 390 B.c. There remains the other explanation, which interprets the festival as a memorial of the flight of the people after the disappearance of 1The first dictator, according to Mommsen, was Manius Valerius (Liv. 2. 18. 6), who bore a doubly well-omened name (supra pp. 293, 303)- 2 Smith-Wayte-Marindin Dict.

That the rites of the two days were not unconnected appears also from the fact that July 5 was a festival of Jupiter, July 7 a festival of Juno. Note too that the former festival was associated with the fate of Romulus at the Caprae palus in the Campus Martius,5 while the latter festival included a sacrifice to Juno Caprotina at the same Caprae palus.6 With regard to the rites themselves, we are told by Varro that on July 5 there were "certain traces of a flight" (aliquot vestigia fugae); and, if we may venture with Merkel to identify the Pophifugia with the Fugalia, it was a time of much license.7 That certainly was the character of July 7, when the handmaids of Rome wore their mistresses' robes, jibed at the passers-by, had a free fight among themselves with fisticuffs and stones, and sat down to a banquet under the boughs of a fig-tree, while the mob in general thronged forth from the city- gates with shouts of "Gaius," "Marcus," "Lucius," etc. Some took all this to be a mimic flight or rout; others, a sign of energy and haste.8 On the whole, it seems pro- bable that the proceedings of both days were a survival of the primitive mode of electing the Roman king. The people had a foot-race (Poplifugia) to determine who was 1 Plut. vit. Rom. 29, Dionys. ant. Rom. 2. 56. 2Cic. de rep. I. 16, Plut. vit.

It is impossible to discuss the Poplifugia without also considering the Regifugium, another ancient festival cele- brated yearly at Rome on February 24. It was popularly supposed to commemorate the expulsion of the Tarquins ; 1 but a mutilated gloss in Festus rejects this explanation, and refers to "a sacrifice in [the Comitium] performed by [the king] and the Salii on [February] 24." 2 Plutarch 3 further states: "There is a certain ancestral sacrifice in the Forum at the Comitium, as it is called, which the king offers, and having offered flees with all haste from the Forum." Plutarch, however, need not be alluding to the Regifugium of February 24; for there are two other days in the year, viz. March 24 and May 24, which in the stone calendars are marked Q.R.C.F. These letters probably denote, as Varro4 says, quando rex comitiavit fas, or 'business may be transacted when the king has been to the Comitium." But Varro goes on to say that on such days the priestly king sacrificed at the Comitium. And a note appended to March 24 in the Praenestine calendar5 runs: "Most persons wrongly hold that this day is described as Q.R.C.F. because on it the king fled from the Comitium. But Tarquin did not depart from the Comitium, and the same rites take place in another month also." It is, then, highly probable that on February 24, and quite possible that on March 24 and May 24, the 10Ov. fast. 2. 685 ff., Paul. exc.

I incline to accept Dr. Frazer's1 conjecture "that he was originally one of those divine kings who are either put to death after a fixed period or allowed to prove by the strong hand or the fleet foot that their divinity is vigorous and unim- paired." 2 If on the same day of February, March, and May he was expected to run his race, it is possible that in early times his probation was a monthly affair. The Etruscans, we know, were even more solicitous about the health of their king, who likewise personated the sky-god3; for, says Macrobius,4 "the Etruscans observed several Nones, inasmuch as every ninth day they used to bid their king all hail and to consult about their own business." The same principle perhaps underlies the Roman system of Nones and Nundinae. On the Nones, according to Varro,5 "the folk used to come into town from the country to their king"; and he adds that a trace of the gathering still exists in the sacra Nonalia, when the priestly king proclaims to the people on the Arx the chief festivals of the month. No doubt these gatherings of country-folk occasioned the regular Nundinae or market-days of Rome. But their origin was religious rather than secular: Granius Licinianus declared that all Nundinae were festivals of Jupiter, because on them the flaminica in the old Palace sacrificed a ram to that deity.6 Servius Tullius was said to have been born on the Nones; but, since the month was uncertain, all Nones alike were regarded as his birthday, and celebrated by 1 Frazer Golden Bough 2 ii. 67. 2 [May not the flight of the king from the altar have been due to the need of escaping before the descent of the deity to partake of the sacrifice ? The idea that it would be dangerous to see the face of a supernatural being is widely- spread, and in the case of a Lightning-god such a dread would be mere -common-sense. -ED.] 3 Class.

After the kings had been driven out there was a danger lest these crowds should demand a fresh king on one of the Nones,2 and consequently the Nundinae were severed from the Nonae.3 If the Nones were, as I suppose, a critical day for the king, we can understand not only the belief that all the Nones were birthdays of Servius Tullius, but also the tradition that Romulus vanished on the Nones, and perhaps even Augustus' superstitious avoidance of serious business on that day.4 In eight months of the year the Nones fell on the fifth day, according to Roman reckoning, from the Kalends; and we have seen that even in July, when the Nones fell on the seventh, the fifth was the Poplifugia, a red-letter day for the king. Moreover, the day after the Kalends, Nones, or Ides was called a "black day," and it was not lawful on it to utter the name of Janus or Jupiter,5 while the fifth day before every such "black day" was also avoided as a day of evil omen.6 It is just possible that the importance thus attached to the fifth day corresponds to a halving of the nine-day period. If so, the singular republican system of interreges or temporary kings, each of whom reigned for five days and then appointed his successor, on one occasion7 as many as fourteen being so nomi- nated,-this system may have been a reversion to monarchy of the most jealously guarded kind. ARTHUR BERNARD COOK. 1Another account (Fest. s.v. "servorum dies" p. 262 Lind., Plut. quaestt. Rom.
