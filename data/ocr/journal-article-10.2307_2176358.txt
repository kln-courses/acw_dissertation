<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS. Naturalism and Agnzosticism. The Gifford Lectures delivered before the University of Aberdeen in the years I896-98. By JAMES WARD, Sc. D. New York, The Macmillan Co.; London, Mac- millan &amp; Co. I899.-Vo1. I, PP. XViii, 302; Vo1. II, Pp. XiV, 294. Dr. Ward's Gifford Lectures possess a two-fold interest. The work, considered in itself, is a deliberate and careful contribution to philosophical literature by one of the most scholarly and courageous of English thinkers, whose widely read article on Psychology in the Encyc/op&amp;cedca Britannica has made many students of the subject de- sirous of a more complete pronouncement of his philosophy. But these lectures have also an importance as constituting a distinct stage in that curious and instructive reactionary movement in English thought, which has followed on the spring-tide of enthusiasm for science, which set in half a century ago with the publication of The Orig-in of Species. And it may at once be asserted that, if compared with any of the recent books in which the real or supposed interests of theology have been championed as against the authority of ' Natural- ism,' the volumes before us must be given a high place. Although in the opening words of his preface the author describes his lectures as "popular," the general reader who is thereby led to expect the rhetorical flights of Mr. Balfour's Foundazions of Belief, or the cheerful commonplaces of Mr. Drummond's Ascent of Mfan, will be disappointed. The style is solid and sometimes a little heavy, and the argument is occasionally rather difficult to follow, but the student's attention is repaid by the author's sober and thoughtful treatment of great subjects. Moreover, Dr. Ward has to a preeminent degree the courage of his convictions, and even those who find his reasoning paradoxical, and are compelled to reject many of his conclusions, may admire the skill and boldness with which he attacks positions usually regarded as impregnable, and the originality and foresight with which he has drawn up his own line of defense. The ground covered in the course of these volumes is very extensive. After the first introductory lecture, the author discusses and criticises those beliefs which he regards as constitutive of, or as auxiliary to, naturalism-the mechanical theory, the theory of evolution, and the theory of psychophysical parallelism. It may be noticed in passing</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 71 that it is ' naturalism' rather than ' agnosticism' which has to bear the brunt of Dr. Ward's attack. He then offers a refutation of dualism, the source, he holds, of many of the errors of men of science; and in the last three lectures we have the constructive part of his treatise-a statement and defense of spiritualistic monism, in that form mainly following the lines of Lotze's Metaphysic, in which Dr. Ward holds the doctrine. Many readers, perhaps, will wish that his design had per- mitted him to develop the latter portion of his work at greater length, even if it had been at the expense of some of his polemic against Spencer and Huxley. There is no part of the volumes which is not worth careful study and discussion, and none, in the present writer's opinion, which is not susceptible to grave criticism, but it may be well to leave Dr. Ward's account of the theories involved in physics and dynamics for the consideration of specialists on those subjects, and to direct the attention of readers of THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW more particularly to his treatment of epistemological and ontological problems. One point, however, may be noted in regard to his earlier lectures. The general trend of the argument is as follows. The sciences which conceive of the world as mechanical lead us to conceptions which can never be brought directly into our sense-experience. " Atoms," "centers of force," Lord Kelvin's "primitive fluid," being con- fessedly hypothetical, and it being forever impossible for our perceptive faculties to reach them, have no claim whatever to be regarded as con- stitutive of the real world. They are merely " fictions," " descrip- tive symbols," "Ihelpful analogies" -though indeed, if Dr. Ward be correct, they describe falsely and are hindrances rather than helps to the seeker after truth. They can yield no knowledge of real things; for the real is always concrete, and therefore the abstractions by which men of science have endeavored to render the world explicable from their point of view have nothing to do with reality. Modern science, according to Dr. Ward, is thus not even Dichtung und Wahrheit but Di/ch/ung pure and simple. Without going into detail it may not be difficult to indicate the fallacy underlying this contention. Scientific investigators are indeed careful to admit the hypothetical character of the representations they offer of the physical basis of the phenomenal world, but a scientific hypothesis is not an arbitrary fiction; if legitimate at all, it is the nearest approximation to the truth that can be made at the time. No doubt, when a theory which has had practical value in assisting in the correlation and coordination of facts has been found by an extension of knowledge to be incom- patible with experience, it may still retain a place in exposition as a</page><page sequence="3">72 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IX. helpful analogy, but it is then no longer accepted as representative of what actually exists, and a more adequate conception becomes at once an object of search. Nor is the abstractness of such notions as ' center of force,' ' atom,' and the rest, a legitimate ground of complaint. No one of these conceptions indeed gives us the rich fulness of the real world. As Hegel so loved to teach, the real is the concrete, and the abstract, just in proportion to its abstractness, is bare and void; but, on the other hand, the concrete is not exclusive of the abstract, but rather is its full explication and development, and, for the due apprehending of the real, its resolution into its component factors is necessary. Dr. Ward's quarrel with the representatives of modern science is not that they do not fully enough carry out the implications of their own conceptions; but rather that these conceptions are me- chanical, that is, non-spiritualistic. Put, were they to abandon this method, is it not evident that all science, all " ordered knowledge " must cease to make progress? If we are to believe that the emer- gence of any event may be due to the spontaneity of a spirit whose action is " free" and unconditioned, are we not asked to abandon our cosmos for a chaos ? Passing over our author's criticism of the theory of evolution- which might have been more satisfactory if he had not directed his polemic so exclusively, and sometimes with an unnecessary fierceness, against Mr. Spencer, whose occasional inconsistencies and vagueness of statement have been often enough animadverted upon-let us look at his discussion of the theory of psychophysical parallelism. He has no difficulty in showing that there is often at the present day a pro- fessed acceptance of the complete equivalence of the mental and phys- ical series, while yet the stress is so constantly and so insistently laid upon the importance of the physical, that, in thought as well as in language, the result has been a materialism utterly unsupported by, and at variance with, the theory of concomitance or parallelism. Against the doctrine, so widespread among those who endeavor to popularize the results of scientific investigation, that the psychical event is but a 'by-product ' of physical forces, the reasoning here used is sound and effective. But nothing is gained to idealism by confusing the issue. Whenever primacy is so given to the material aspect of reality, except it be frankly for temporary convenience in investigation or exposition, there is a departure from the theory of psychophysical parallelism. Spinoza, its true founder, never made this mistake. And as against the theory in its legitimate form the argument of Dr. Ward has little weight. The concomitance of</page><page sequence="4">No. i.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 73 certain physical changes with psychical processes is matter of experience, and it is well for the reader to remind himself how numerous, how varied, and how well-established such correspond- ences are, for Dr. Ward passes very lightly over this part of his sub- ject. Of course these cases might be interpreted as indicative of the mutual interaction of the mental and the bodily; but ' spiritualism,' as an ontological system, utterly rejects this view. Spontaneity belongs to the psychical alone, according to our author. If we are to abandon the belief that we are justified in regarding the psychical and the ma- terial as disparate phenomenal series, the changes in each being ex- plicable only in its own terms, we are not to substitute for it the dual- ism of interacting substances. We are required to find a spiritualistic interpretation for all physical events, and to regard all the objective world, not only in its totality, but in every detail, as the outcome of the originating activity of mind. These are the alternatives really before us; that the modern psychologist and physiologist often use language more suited to a crude materialism than to the theory of psychophysical parallelism is true and is regrettable; but if spiritualistic monism is to establish the claim its defender makes for it, the true rival must be overcome. It must be shown that spiritualism offers a view of the world more intelligible, more self-tonsistent, more in har- mony with ascertained facts, than that which, recognizing within the sphere of our experience two aspects under which reality is presented, regards each event in the physical series as conditioned by preexist- ing and coexisting physical facts, and the processes of consciousness as in themselves similarly conditioned by mental factors, however dif- ficult or in many cases impossible it may be to discover them later. Dr. Ward objects to the theory of concomitance that it implies an abandonment of the subjective standpoint, since "psychical then means not my experience as it is for me, but my experience as it is for the physiologist who is studying my brain and my organs of sense and movement." And it is true that, when we speak of the world as pos- sessing both psychical and physical aspects, we are considering it in relation to ontology, not to psychology-the psychologist as such deals only with experience as forming the psychological series, he has to do with states of consciousness, just as the physicist is concerned only with the series which we regard as constituting the material world. But surely there is nothing illegitimate in investigating the nature and significance of conscious experience as an objective fact, since the psychical means not alone my consciousness, but all consciousness; the thoughts, feelings, and emotions of others being possible objects of</page><page sequence="5">74 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IX. knowledge, although only known indirectly. If, then, I have reason to believe that such and such brain-changes go on concurrently with such and such conscious processes, why may I not observe the coordi- nation, and recognize it as significant when I attempt to understand the nature of what I experience ? It is true that mental and physical facts alike are only known to the individual as they enter into, and are constitutive of, his experience; but, while this individualistic point of view may suffice for an epistemology, we may well hesitate to accept it as providing us with an ontology. To do so would be to make the Ego creative of the universe, and would give rise to a mere parody of Fichteanism. Such, of course, is not the doctrine of the work before us. Ideal- ism, if it is to enter upon the service of natural theology, must make the perilous leap from the finite to the infinite, from the consciousness of the individual to a universal consciousness. Dr. Ward's point of departure is epistemological. Knowledge, it is asserted, is a unity involving both subject and object. But subject and object are not en- tities per se. Either apart from its correlate is an unintelligible ab- straction. The unity of the two is an ultimate, and therefore an inexplicable, fact. The relation between them is not a causal one, because causality implies reality, and the real is constituted by the synthesis of these two factors. So far the subjective and objective elements in consciousness are treated as coequal, but Dr. Ward does not long continue to keep the balance true. We find that the subject which we have been forbidden to think of save as correlate to the object, is active and " chooses " its object. The primary fact in ex- perience is conation, not cognition, hence it is from the activity of the subject that reality emerges. Individual experience is thus made up of subject plus object, in which synthesis the subject is the active element, the object is the world as present to the individual conscious- ness. If we ask what the real world is more than this individual ex- perience, we are referred to a " universal experience " which, like that of the individual, consists of subject and object; the object is " the sun, the earth, and the rest of what we call nature "; the subject we are led to infer is the Divine Spirit on whose activity the natural world depends. This line of argument is perfectly familiar to all students of modern philosophy. The crucial question is: What proof is offered of the existence of such universal experience? That of Dr. Ward is based on the belief we have that the object presented to the sense perception of one man, is identical with that perceived by his neigh- bours. The sun one man is looking at is ' the same thing' that nine</page><page sequence="6">No. i.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 75 other men simultaneously are looking at. He does not seem to recog- nize that this belief is based on the very dualism he deprecates as un- philosophical. The observer regards the sun he sees as identical with that his fellows see because he inevitably regards the sun, not as a factor existing in combination with his own ego, and only so consti- tuting the real, but just as a 'thing ' apart from himself. A very unsophisticated and uncritical opinion no doubt, but just so soon as the idealistic philosopher shall convince him that his experience is just subject plus object, each term existing only in relation to the other, must he be logically forced to admit that his assumption of an object common to himself and others was unwarranted-the sun he sees will no longer be ' the same' as the sun others see. It seems impossible by any mere analysis of the data of individual knowledge to reach a conception of reality wider than the circle of individual experience. The monad, in Leibniz's well-known phrase, has no windows. If space permitted, it would be interesting to examine Dr. Ward's teleology. He is bolder than most modern idealists and rejects the notion of a teleological theory that shall be consistent with, though in some sort, transcending, a mechanical view of the natural world. He will make no terms with the enemy, and declares the two systems to be wholly incompatible. It would, however, have been welcome to his readers if he had shown more fully and clearly in what way he conceives purpose and reason to be present in the universe. Whether it is a theistic or a pantheistic theology to which his philosophy offers support, is left in doubt. So also there seems to be a deliberate vague- ness in regard to the ' freedom' which his spiritualism implies. He admits that by his system " contingency is let into the very heart of things," but " the contingency is not that of chance but of free- dom, as far as everything that is is a law to itself, has an end for itself, and seeks the good." Surely, when no justification is offered for the use of terms so purely anthropomorphic as ' law,' ' end' and ' good' in what professes to be an ontological system, such a sentence comes dangerously near to sound without sense. And it is for such " airy nothings " that we are asked to abandon the conception of na- ture that guided Descartes and Leibniz, Darwin and Kelvin and Helmholtz. E. RITCHIE.</page></plain_text>
