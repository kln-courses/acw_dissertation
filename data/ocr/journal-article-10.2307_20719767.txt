<plain_text><page sequence="1">Utopianism from Orientation to Agency: What Are We Intellectuals Under Post-Fordism To Do?1 DARKO SUVIN To the memory of Bob Elliott, Herbert Marcuse and Louis Marin, and to Predrag Matvejevic, the Utopian of "ex." Monsieur est Persan? Comment peut-on etre Persan? ? Montesquieu (You are a Marxist/utopian/activist? How can one be a Marxist/utopian/activist? ? PoMo translation) "Bring your knowledge of disaster" (telegram summoning Ch. Beard to Tokyo after the great earthquake) 0. "The Dark Now" (free after Bloch) We literally do not want to be what we are. ? Kierkegaard 0.1. What is to be done by an intellectual wedded to utopianism in what H?lderlin, suffering from the breakdown of the great French Revolution, called the d?rftige Zeit (forgetting the misinterpretation by Heidegger, this can be rendered as penurious, indigent, shabby, needy, mean, paltry, poor times)? How do we find the proper "point of attack" to begin articulating the lay of this wasted land and the ways that might be found out of it? I shall start with a little known lecture by Foucault (discussed in Macherey, "Natural" 181-84), who poses the question: "What then is this present to which I belong? . .. and (what is more) [what is the thinker's] role in this process where he [sic] finds himself both an element and an actor." I inter pret this to mean that, as opposed to the individualist Me, there is no subjec tivity which does not centrally include belonging to what Sartre would call a situation, out of which her projects are elaborated. Foucault goes on to com ment that such questioning no longer asks (or I would say, does not only ask) about "his belonging to a doctrine or to a tradition," but about "his belonging to a certain 'us\ ..." This "us," I'd further update Foucault, participates in a given cultural as well as politico-economical ensemble of</page><page sequence="2">Utopianism from Orientation to Agency 163 synchronic relationships, "present" in all senses of that term. In the vein of Spinoza, all of us are pars naturae rather than simply a disembodied gaze standing over and above it, and we are constantly interpellated by various necessities of our constitutive situation. The thinker's only alternative is whether to respond by going on to think to some purpose, of finding his freedom (as Engels almost said) in facing the interpellating necessity, or to respond as Dostoevsky's childishly resentful Underground Man by saying "just because of that, I won't respond." In other words, as the good old reac tionary Chesterton once remarked, you may be free to draw a camel without humps, but then you'll find out that you haven't been free to draw a camel. . . If we decide that a thinker or intellectual is, by definition, the one who responds, who is responsive and responsible, then I shall supplement my point of attack by attempting to build upon a great ancestor who is a much less dubious role-model than Foucault, since he was not desperately react ing against the Communist Party, leftwing phenomenology, and Marxism but maintaining a fruitful dialog with them?Walter Benjamin. In the highly endangered Jetztzeit of the 1930s he concluded that an intellectual work should be judged not only by what is its relation toward the relations of pro duction but before all, by what is its position within them. It is in and because of this position, Benjamin held, that an intellectual producer is impelled by his professional or class interest to exercise solidarity with the producing workers. I shall go on to discuss how we must today (as Marx already did) add the relations of consumption as closing the circle of com modity fetishism and re-enchanting it, but also return to Benjamin's realistic central thrust. How does this hold for the writing, criticizing or indeed actu alizing of Utopias? Is it pragmatically appropriate or pertinent to the demands of the situation, is it oriented toward its nodal points, is it what Brecht called an intervening or meshing thinking {eingreifendes Denken? cf. also Macherey, "Materialist" 145^6)? 0.2. But this general orientation is not enough. One of the major lessons of the "short 20th Century" has been, I feel, the dethroning of the nuclear, indi vidualist or billiard-ball interior Self (I attempted an orientation in this field in "Polity"). This means raising the Subject into a problem and concomi tantly the Body into a (sometimes fetishized) litmus paper for and final line of defense against the alienation of labour, reification of people's mutual relationships, and hegemonically created massification. The Marxian and Nietzschean recognition that agential praxis is the end-all of understanding also spells the death-knell of the neat scientistic division between looking subject and looked-at object. What then is this particular Darko Suvin able to contribute as a valid stance under the stars in the not quite Blochian Dunkles Jetzt! What is he/ am I supposed to say of note to a gathering of people seriously (and usually joyously) concerned with Utopian ideas/fictions/colonies? Am I supposed to either further buttress or abandon my (in)famous sundering of the latter two, or my even more professionally transgressive refusal to sunder Utopia and</page><page sequence="3">164 UTOPIAN STUDIES SF, both dating back to MOSF? I assume I've been punished enough for the latter by the (so far as I can see) unanimous refusal of the SF people to get aboard a discussion of utopianism unless written by women after Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and of the utopological people to even take into serious consideration what I wrote about More, Lucian, Swift, Blake, Percy Shelley, never mind the Frenchmen and Italians?in fact anything in the 120 pages between the theory and Wells, since it is in a book that has SF in its title; so that I can simply shrug my shoulders and say "transgressing the slots by which one lives in academe doesn't pay, sed salvavi animam meant" Or am I to turn to what are, to my mind, essential entries on the agenda of utopol ogy today??such as: ? the already mentioned Body; ? the already mentioned Subject, the multiply fragmented and malleable yet holistic Subject so overwhelming on today's collectivized horizons; ? futures that are not simply exponential take-offs from the past, so that breaks in experience mask continuity in augmentation of profits, but whose point is to think the incorporation and revival for the memory of losses and victims: frame-altering, bifurcating endangered futures; ? or finally (which is maybe the same in other words: but then all these entries are aspects of one another) the Dead, in Benjamin's sense that even they are not safe if the enemy goes on winning, if the break mas querading as extrapolation swallows our past.2 But I've written about the Subject, the Body and its so-called emotions, and death as presupposition of life in a number of other places, and connect ing it with the Utopian hub from which they spring and/or to which they tend demands a book I don't have money to write. So that I choose rather to incorporate Subject and Collective Bodies in an investigation which I think of as the continuation of the hint I gave in my essay "Locus, Horizon, and Orientation," namely that a fuller discussion demands providing a focus on the oriented agents able or failing to dynamize any?but most clearly the Utopian?locus against certain horizons. This is a discussion which is in our present, no doubt tainted, terms political in both the most pragmatic daily sense and yet only if this sense is infused with the classical sense within which we humans were rightly defined as zoa politika, living beings of the city-state, communal animals. This might also be the most useful way to define my place not only towards but also within the Post-Fordist Deluge, and to ostend it to you as an articulation, a "polemical sketch of the salient activities and claims" (Ross 13), proposed for a debate we cannot live without. 1. Living in Fantasyland (Dystopia, also Fake Utopia and Anti-Utopia) So long as there is still one beggar, so long myth still goes on. ? Benjamin 1.1. I shall enter into the thick of the matter by means of two apparently unrelated but I think revealing bits or bytes from the flood of informations that so efficiently hides the constellations of extremist reality transforma</page><page sequence="4">Utopianism from Orientation to Agency 165 tions from us today. One is the estimate of what I take to be the most trust worthy international source in the mid-80s that some 40 million people die from hunger each year, which is equal to 300 jumbo jet crashes per day every day with total loss of lives; or (I don't know which is worse) the UN report that in 1996 "[njearly 800 million people do not get enough food, and about 500 million are chronically malnourished" (Dreze-Sen Hunger 35 and Human 20; cf. also the too optimistic World Bank Poverty). The second is press reports according to which the ex-Mouseketeer ms. Billie Jean Matay unsuccessfully sued Disneyland not only for a holdup of her family in the parking lot but also for the emotional trauma her grandchildren, aged 5, 7, and 11, suffered when they were taken backstage and saw Mickey Mouse and the Lion King removing the heads of their costumes (Gazette C15 and "Next"; I resist the temptation to linger at the Disney corporation's emblem atic progress from mouse to lion in order to follow the broad picture). Now, I very much doubt the starving hundreds of millions or the couple of billion people eking out a living, at the periphery of the world system or dossing down in the center of the affluent cities of the North, would have time for the Matay family's Disneyland trauma. They are absorbed by sur viving the fallout from the civil and overt wars waged by the big corpora tions, and which with poetic justice migrate from their "hot" foci also into the "Third World inside the metropolis," the creeping war in all our slums so far best described in hip-hop and in the post-Dischian and post-Dickian dystopian SF of Piercy, Butler (Octavia, not Judith), Gibson, Spinrad or Cadigan. Nonetheless I submit to you there is a deep subterranean bond between, on the one hand, the starving bellies and bacterial epidemics among the masses of the South, and on the other hand, the starving minds and brainwashing epidemics moulding all of us in the North: a bond between misery and drugging, best incarnated by the AIDS pandemic, where the collapse of the bodies' immune system is an almost too pat alle gory of PoMo capitalism. For, the ideological Disneyfication (and I shall return to the fact that the Disney corporation is by now one of the biggest "vertical" monopolists in movies, media, and book publishing) is a drug of the brainwashing variety. What is perhaps worst?and we intellectuals should know why?is that this drug functions by channelling the imagina tion rather than by chemical stimulation or inhibition: it uses the brain's imaginative powers to create empathetic images which are a fake Novum or what Louis Marin called a degenerate Utopia. As the old theologians knew, the corruption of the best creates the worst, preempting and preventing any radical Novum or Utopia?the indispensable precondition for altering the lot of ms. Matay's grandchildren as well as the millions upon millions of kids of (for ex.) Salaam Bombay. 1.2. As all opiates and fake utopianisms, Disneyfication is predicated upon alienated labour so that people crave satisfaction in "leisure time" consump tion (Ewen). But a further turn of the screw specific of our times is that in a Debordian "society of the spectacle" each person that could be a citizen</page><page sequence="5">166 UTOPIAN STUDIES viewer is both cut off from the producing of (or in) the media and posi tioned within a mass of atomized fellow-viewers, where a dynamic "desire to consume . .. [is] the only permissible participation in the social process" (Bukatman 36-37). The abiding political disempowerment is channelled into a rage for addictive consuming that shapes a collective unanimity where, paradoxically, the fake Utopia is felt as personal. It has eaten into ms. Matay's brain so deeply that she sobbed uncontrollably in court at the loss of "the happy feeling" she had known in Disneyland and on the Mickey Mouse Club TV show in the 1950s. This is, as Marin taught us precisely on the example of Disneyland, Utopia eaten up by the very ideology which it was its original Morean and Morrisian function to fictionally unveil?in order, I would add, to rob ideology of its absolutizing and indisputable power, in order to deliver it to the critique of practical reason. The slogans of this alienation are "comfort, affluence, consumerdom, unlimited scientifico technical progress, omnipotence and good conscience,. . .values assumed by violence and exploitation appearing disguised as law and order."3 I shall not follow up here the whole subtle, sometimes perhaps over subtle, rhetoric of Marin's book about neutralization etc.; it may be of inter est to you if I report that in a discussion we had before his untimely death, he admitted that his basic approach was still too dependent on Engels's by now untenable split between Utopia and science. For our present pressing purposes, I shall focus only on a few generalizable foci of Marin's astute dissection of Disneyland, whose features can be discerned best, I shall argue, if we see it in terms of dystopia masquerading as Utopia. This argu ment comprises two points. First, Marin quite rightly seized on what I'd call reproductive empathy, the fact that "the Disneyland visitor is on the stage, an actor of the play being performed, caught by his role like the rat by the trap, and alienated into the ideological character he plays without knowing it. . . .'Performing' Disney's Utopia, the visitor 'realizes' the ideology of the ruling class as the mythic legend of origins for the society in which he lives" (298-99). Marin thus reactualized the founding insight Benjamin reached looking at movies and advertizing, that "the commercial glance into the heart of things . . . demolishes the space for the free play of viewing" by abolishing any critical distance (GS 4/1: 131-21). Second, Disneyland?here functioning as a privileged, because pioneering, topologically accessible, and even mappable,/??rs pro toto of the capitalist and especially US admass brainwash?is a "degenerated Utopia" in two reinforcing ways, which I shall label transfer ideologizing and substitution commodifying (the analogy to Freud's account of dreamwork as removal and condensation, Verdichtung und Verschiebung, is striking). Transfer ideologizing, the first achievement of Disneyland, performs a "Mickey Mouse" version of ideology: the continually reinforced empa thizing immersion, the "thick," topologically and figurally concrete, and seamless false consciousness, injects the hegemonic bourgeois version of US history into people's neurons by twisting into a different semantics? thus "naturalizing" and neutralizing?three imaginative fields: historical</page><page sequence="6">Utopianism from Orientation to Agency 167 time as the space of alternative choices; the foreign/ers; and the natural world. Marin does not focus much on historical time, except to suggest that it is turned into ideology, into the myth of technological progress (316 and 320-21). He does not fully conceptualize either?Marin proceeds rather by a kind of rhetorical mimicry of Disneyland alienation?how the foreign and nature are denied, how that same Social Darwinism turns them into the primitive, the savage, and the monstrous (321), but I think this can be fol lowed by means of a number of his chemin faisant analyses. This holds in particular for the discussion immediately following the spatial and perform ative "central access" to Disneyland and dealing with the phantasmatic Fan tasyland, which is the PR "sign of Disneyland, the trade-mark of the Utopia itself... the privileged Utopian locus of Disneyland" (305-06; I'm adapt ing these pages in the following account). The very aptly named Fantasyland is constituted by personalized and impersonating images (themselves second-degree empathetic citations of Disney's comics, cartoons, etc.). Reality becomes the double or twin of the image in Marin's earlier and better?though not flashier?version of Bau drillard's simulacra. (The great ancestor here was Philip Dick's SF from the 1960s on.) This doubling is itself double: first, the image is turned into a mate rial reality by figures of stone, plastic, plaster or rubber, but most empatheti cally and emphatically by human representers disguised into such fantasy characters. The representer (le figurant) has become an embodied, flesh and-blood represented (le figure) and signified?the unmasking of which as fake when faced with the no doubt sweaty faces of Disney corporation's tired employees then quite rightly shocked the Matays. But second and sym metrically inverse, reality is transformed into image: insofar as the visitor is caught up in Disneyland, there is no other reality but that of the figure or representation into which (as Brecht would say) you creep in an act of psy chic vampirism. This is also the proceeding of magic, which elevates its images to the ontological status of another, underlying reality (and it is logi cal that the Disney World NBA basketball team is the Orlando Magic). Any alternative non-narcissistic imaginary, imagination as consciousness of the possibility of non-drugged radical otherness or indeed simply as fertile pos sibility of shuttling in and out of myth (Mannoni), is being neutralized here: "while you believe you're enjoying yourself, you're absorbing the ideology needed for the reproduction of the relations of production. Historical reality is being concealed from you, it is camouflaged underneath a stylized and fascinating verisimilitude. . . .You're given a prefabricated dream: ... a homegrown unconscious (un inconscient maison), perfectly ideologized" (Mikel Dufrenne, cited in Guattari 96-97) . As Marin established, Disneyland first neutralizes external reality by means of the car and the dollars that got the spectator to enter it. But it then substitutes a transmogrified reality produced by the hallucinatory chan nelling of desire in Fantasyland, which is itself a terror: "the violence exer cised upon the imaginary by the phantasm of that Disneyland district. . . ." When "another" reality appears, it is "as the reality of the banalized, routine</page><page sequence="7">168 UTOPIAN STUDIES images of Walt Disney movies, poor signs of an imagination homogenized by the mass media." This fake Other is a trap for desire, its caricatural col lective image. Disneyland's careful and most efficacious organization of desires installs the imprinted repetition of the familiar as the supreme good and demonizes the radically different Other. I find it lamentable that ms. Matay could not hold Disneyland accountable for transgressing this basic ideological contract with the brainwashed, for not policing its parking lot bet ter, not sufficiently occulting that drugging is necessary for life in PoMo capi talism as gangsterism, the inescapable obverse of Disneyland's business coin. This allows the too immediate, destabilizing shock of the sordid lifeworld violence and insecurity?a reality which the unanimous media make visible only for the relatively small or at best medium gangsters, from the holdup for the next fix to Saddam Hussein, while the arms merchants, the starvers of hun dreds of millions, and the druggers of billions of people remain invisible. The second achievement of Disneyland is, however, a new twist on age-old ideology-mongering and constitution of graven images. The Golden Calf is capillarized in the psychic bloodstream as commodity. This perva sive upshot is introduced by "Main Street USA": "commodities are signifi cations and significations are commodities" (Marin 317). It is confirmed at the centre as "life is a permanent exchange and perpetual consuming" (319, Marin's italics). By giving an infantilized connotation of "security blanket" to images, which Debord famously defined as the final form of commodity reification (ch. 1), Disneyland produces constantly repeated demand to match the constantly recycled offer: it commodifies desire, and in particular the desire for signification or meaningfulness (cf. Attali 259 and passim, and Schickel). Walt Disney himself stated to Parade in 1972 his object was to sell happiness (cited at second hand in Dorfman 29). Disneyfication, then, centrally means the pursuit of happiness, twisted from its Jeffersonian ori gins to a permanent readiness for re-enchanted commodification: "the pur suit of happiness becomes a lifetime of shopping" (Lummis 48). The dynamic and sanitized empathizing into the pursuit of commodity is ideologically allegorized as anthropomorphic animals who stand for various affects that make up this pursuit. The affects and stances are strictly confined to the petty-bourgeois "positive" range: so that, roughly, Mickey introduces good cheer, the Lion King courage and persistence, etc. "Just try to get [things such as hunger, lack of shelter, cold or disease] past the turnstiles at Disney land sometime!" (Dorfman 60)?shades of the Matay family! This Disney infantilization marks and displaces a double rejection. First, of an active intervention into the real world which would make the pursuit of happiness collectively attainable: it is a debilitating daydream which appeals to the same mechanism as empathizing performances and publicity (see Berger et al. 146-49). Second and obversely, it rejects any reality constriction of one's desire, however shallow. While Disneyland is wedded to consumer dynamics, to an ever expanding market (Dorfman 202), it remains deeply inimical to knowledge, which crucially includes an understanding of limits for any endeavour?and in particular of the final personal limit of death.</page><page sequence="8">Utopianism from Orientation to Agency 169 Disneyfication denies death (see Benjamin, GS V: 121); Snow White?and so many other cartoon villains, for ex. Coyote?must always be magically resuscitated: "Life is dreamt without death; . . . knowledge is dreamt as consumption and not production" (Dorfman 170-71 and cf. 199-204). It is thus a degenerate form of ideology in comparison to religion and other beliefs whose strategic object is to give meaning to death (cf. Suvin Lessons, ch. 5). While Disneyfication is thus a displacement in Freud's sense, it is also more; and it might be more precisely identified as a shaping of affectual invest ment into commodifying?a metonymy of what Jameson has penetratingly discussed as the PoMo "consumption of the very process of consumption" (Postmodernism 276), say in TV. 1.3. So my first thesis submitted to your discussion is (as seems only proper for a Gramscian, see 164) double-pronged, epistemological and political. la: while I have little doubt that collective realities exist (see more in 1.4 below), it is dubious that empirical entities can be neatly disjoined from imaginary ones; in other words, it is dubious?though still perhaps not only useful but unavoidable for pedagogical purposes?that empirical or existent societies can be neatly disjoined from imaginary or non-existent ones. I'll argue in a moment that there is no identification of any token or sample existent without an imaginary type which permits the identifier to recognize it as such, say the sample Mickey Mouse as type of "Disney's comforting being" (Geborgenheit), lb: we live today in dystopia as well as in anti utopia?perhaps because the dystopia is an anti-utopia, a deliberate project for subalternity. This was dimly adumbrated in the flash of horror (Gewor fenheit) the fatherless Matay family had at the backstage divestment. Is it only professional idiocy to conclude that we desperately need (at least to begin with) some semantic hygiene as to what we are speaking about? Is it only intellectualist expert doodling? Not, I firmly believe, if we are doing this as a link in an ongoing praxis culminating in action; if Rosa Luxemburg, in the midst of World War 1, before the admass efficiency, was possibly too optimistic in believing that "to speak the truth is already a rev olution," we must inherit her optimism of knowledge and will, and say that to articulate a categorial hygiene is the precondition for any salvational rev olution. I do not therefore see any break in the continuity of my discussion if I immediately segue from politico-economic data and ideological emo tions into epistemological discussions of the proper vocabulary and articula tion we need in order to see sufficiently steadily the ground upon which we unstably stand, and to see it sufficiently whole?though I shall come back to the complex and indispensable mediations and in particular to ourselves as (potential) intellectuals. Allow me therefore a very brief and compressed epistemic reminder: All conscious thinking involves a subjunctive and imaginative component, imagining what would happen if something were other than the way it is (Ellis 1997). Even for the infant consciousness, identifying an object involves imagining how it could be manipulated: there is no "perceptual conscious</page><page sequence="9">170 UTOPIAN STUDIES ness" without imagination and subjunctivity, that is, without an implied counterfactuality (cf. for ex. Piaget 1928 and 1969). Conscious seeing, as opposed to staring, occurs only when we attend to (look for) the object on which we are to focus, that is, when we ask "Is my imaginative/ry type instan tiated by the token in my visual field right now?" In it, the imaginative act precedes the perceptual one (Bruner 1986); there is no formulation of ques tions that does not spring from feelings of desire or interest (Luriia 1973), which entail imaginations. It is this source which is being captured and channelled into infantilism by Disneyland. And I propose we can make sense of this by seeing it with Marin as a fake Utopia, which we according to our interests decipher as a dystopia and therefore also as anti-utopia. Map-making and naming are after all the founding gestures, the seed or root (etymon) of any Utopian venture?narrativized in fiction, empirically localized in colonies. Baudrillard's consciously outrageous claim that the map precedes the territory is quite one-sided, though up to a point salutary as a goad to thinking: for no territory can be constituted as territory (instead of a lot of terrains) unless a drawn and/or verbal map delimits it as such. While obversely (as is neatly proved by contraries in an ironic story by Borges) the map is not the territory, it is both a model of the territory and the territory seen through a grid of epistemic conventions, seen as an overview instead of as a bodily experience or indeed a buzzing confusion of random phenomena. 1.4. Thus, what is anti-utopia? And what dystopia? They are incompletely stabilized neologisms, but to use them as efficient cognitive tools we should try to stabilize them for collective manipulation. Some years ago I made such a disambiguating proposal to my student Ron Zajac, and it is briefly sketched in his M.A. (2; I note with pleasure that it tallies with Lyman Sar gent's [188], though his definition insists on objectively "non-existent soci eties," and I've mentioned that I reject commonsense objectivism?see Suvin, "Cognitive"). Mr Zajac and I decided to call "dystopia" a community where sociopolitical institutions, norms, and relationships between its individuals are organized in a significantly less perfect way than in the author's commu nity. Accepting the objection (by Wittgenstein or Brecht) that nothing is seen without being "seen as X" because it is "seen from the stance Y," I'd today add to my original MOSF-derived, somewhat formalist or objectivist definition something like "significantly less perfect, as seen by a representa tive of a discontented social class or fraction, whose value-system defines 'perfection.'" As a secondary recomplication, there is a special case of a sociopolitically different locus which finally also turns out to be a dystopia, but which is explicitly designed to refute a fictional and/or otherwise imag ined Utopia; and I hope we were following the bent of the English language when we proposed to call it "anti-utopia," evacuating the uneconomical use of this term as a synonym of dystopia. "Anti-utopia" thus designates a pre tended Utopia, a community whose hegemonic principles pretend to its being more perfectly organized than any thinkable alternative, while our representative "camera eye" and value-monger finds out it is significantly</page><page sequence="10">Utopianism from Orientation to Agency 171 less perfect than an alternative. Finally, it becomes logically inescapable to invent a name for those dystopias which are not also anti-utopias, but in order not to abet the Babylonian confusion of languages around us, I shall simply call it the "simple" dystopia. Since we have here a somewhat complex state of affairs, I believe it might be clarified by a minimal amount of formalization in terms of inter textual Possible Worlds. Let me call PWq the describer's and evaluator's empirical world (or better?the dominant ideas or encyclopedia thereof), and PWU the imaginative Other (utopian/ dystopian) world. In that case, the intertext of "simple" dystopia (that is, of that cluster of dystopias which is not also anti-utopia, say Pohl-Kornbluth's Space Merchants or other "new maps of hell") is PWq, and what is "inter" or shared here are some strategi cally central tendencies of the author's empirical world. The intertext or ref erential (Eco would say inferential) foil of anti-utopia, however, is PWU: a non-empirical PW intended to be significantly better than PWq but failing to be such: ANTI-UT. "SIMPLE" DYST. "SIMPLE" DYSTOPIA: PWd PW0 ANTI-UTOPIA: PWau &lt; &gt; PWU The purpose of PWd is an awful warning against things going on as they do in the original empirical world PWqi, sometimes wedded to a hope that it may be changed?"if others will but see it as I do" (Morris)?into a less dangerous and happier PW02. The purpose of PWau is an awful warning against a new PWU, as a rule wedded to a hope that we can get rid of that novel delusion and return to the original PW0i. Seeing Disneyland?stand ing in for Post-Fordism?as a fake Utopia consubstantial with (deciphered as) anti-utopia is a move analogous to those utopographer opponents of Bel lamy who have Julian West waking up to the fact he was being hoodwinked by an evil empire. Seeing Disneyland then simultaneously as a dystopia pre vents us from regressive nostalgia for the good old days of (say) the 60s or of the antifascist coalition, the lessons of which we must nonetheless sublate if we are to have a chance of getting at any happier PW02. This little mental exercise does not at all claim to work out a full sys tem of Utopian sub-genres or facets. Still, I wish to add a further important caveat I did begin by saying these distinctions are tricky. I've been arguing that there is strictly speaking no objective "empirical world" out there with out its simultaneously and co-constitutively "being seen as" such, and indeed as such-and-such. (This doesn't at all mean "there's nothing out there" interacting with anybody's gaze or action, as the P0M0 vulgate, though not its best people, claimed: try jumping off a skyscraper without a parachute . . .) But I'd defend my operative distinction between empirical and Utopian world by saying that there was?and is!?a strong, ideologi cally dominant illusion of such an empirical world, seen at one glance by DYSTOPIA {</page><page sequence="11">172 UTOPIAN STUDIES God or asymptotically by Science or Mankind, in that modern scientism which impinges deeply on and largely determines our experiential world. The distinction depends on the bourgeois or capitalist utopianism, beginning with Jules Verne, having denied that it is Utopian and instead being predom inantly "naturalized"?presenting the ideology of progress and Social Dar winism as natural (see MOSF ch. 7 and both titles by Barthes) and not needing explicit, ideologically foregrounded figuration. Up to?say?the 1950s-70s, the Powers-That-Be rightly refused?because they did not need it?the stroke of genius with which Thomas More endowed his King Uto pus: cutting off the ideal topology of Utopia from the experiential continent. No Disneyland is imaginable before Fordism. Then, it was mainly opposi tionists (socialist or anarchists on the Left, reactionaries on the Right, with some technocrats ? la Skinner?and indeed much Wells?in between) who carried on with topologically and/or conceptually explicit, let me call them ruptural Utopias. It should be added that the dominant ideological horizon of anti-utopia is in any historical monad determined by opposition to the dominant idea/s/ of Utopia, to the dominant imaginary PWU. In the Modernist "short 20th C" (Hobsbawm dates it ca. 1917-73, thus underlining its crucial but probably not exclusive parallels with Leninism), this dominant idea was either some kind of socialist?usually perverted or pseudo-socialist?imaginative topol ogy, or technocratic etatism with few if any socialist traits. Thus, as a rule, only the "simple dystopian" horizon applied to high capitalism while the anti-utopian one applied to rotting pseudo-socialism. It seems to me signifi cant for the social class/es of intellectuals which articulated such anti utopias that at any rate the best examples thereof (for ex. the Holy Trinity of Zamiatin-Huxley-Orwell) subsumed both capitalist and Stalinist etatism into its foil PWU, and yet did not envisage this resulting in a radically better PW02 However, the unprecedented Post-Fordist mobilization and colonization of people's desires and of all the remaining non-capitalized spaces (making Huxley's Pala in Island today possibly more important than Brave New World) now requires masqued, infantile fantasies. In that light, Asada's playful proposition that our period should not be called mature or late but "infantile capitalism" (631) is quite correct if taken as a kind of infantilized, g?teuse senescence which cannot mature further: the dusk creature on three rather than four legs in the Sphinx's riddle. Desire, images, "culture" can no longer be disjoined from economics: rather, it is their interpenetration which constitutes the new mode of production's corrupt strength, that is?source of major profits (and a counter-force can only be found in a sane interpene tration). This has been brilliantly argued by Stuart Hall (for ex. 243), while Fredric Jameson has even remarked that "everything in our social life? from economic value and state power to practices and to the very structure of the psyche itself?can be said to have become 'cultural' in some original and as yet untheorized sense" {Postmodernism 48) and developed this at length throughout that book. Culture began supplying authoritative frame works and foci for agency and meaning after "belief became polluted, like</page><page sequence="12">Utopianism from Orientation to Agency 173 the air or the water" (de Certeau 147), so that orthodox religions (including scientism and liberalism) rightly devolved to just another, if more privileged sect?yet religiosity was more in demand than ever amid physical and psychic indigence. Culture co-opted by capitalism is today no longer a fully distinct sphere of activities but a colonization of the "service" or consumption focussed society in the twin guise of information and esthetics: information intensive production in working time (the best example is biotechnology, whose output is information inscribed in living matter, so that the engineer ing involved is the processing or "reading" of this information), and "esthetic" consumption in leisure time (cf. Haug Critique, and Kamper et al. 55-58 and 64ff.). The new orthodoxy of belief proceeds thus "camouflaged as facts, data and events" (de Certeau 151)?or as "culture industry" images. An exemplary (bad) case of the latter are the edulcorated fables and fairy-tales of Disneyland. Disneyland's first move is analogous to King Utopus's cutting off Uto pia from the everyday continent: a spatial rupture (splendidly analyzed by Marin's account of the Disneyland layout). Yet this is only a mimicry, insect not twig, which by reason of its pervasive and invading ideological continu ity with the everyday hegemony functions as harbinger and accelerator of mega-corporate capitalism. At this point?more or less contemporaneous with the exhaustion of Leninist and Social-Democratic socialism, of the Welfare State?a new monster has appeared that must be understood as topologically opposed but axiologically intensificatory?rather than opposi tional as in the More to Morris canon. Thus it not only mimics a ruptural genre (the classical Utopia, PWU) but it also appropriates a Wellsian dynamic, invasive subversion of empirical reality (PW0). Furthermore, if we take the Disney enterprise as an allegorical exemplum, its pervasiveness is not only intensionally total (in all fields of life) but also extensionally total (global) as none before (cf. Jameson's Political, but his whole work bears on this point): Disneylands brainwash impartially and without discrimination (non olet) consumers of all social classes and in the whole Tripartite Commission world, including Europe and Japan. All of us live in a dynamically aggres sive fake Utopia whose "degeneracy" we nonetheless absolutely have to? upon pain of brain rot?decipher as anti-utopia. This was most stimulatingly seen in Philip Dick's ubiquitously invading stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, whose prescient articulation merits a longer consideration?thus to my impenitent mind confirming that it is sterile to cut off "pure Utopian lit." texts from SF. I'd today go further and argue that confining Utopia to fiction only or small colonies only, not to speak of pure ideas, is equally sterile, channelling it away from praxis.4 More than ever, we need as clear as possible distinctions and delimitations of concepts; but only if their articulation "cuts reality at its joints," that is, performs as good an approximation as possible to the increasingly complex bastardry and impurity of experience. For one example, the Disneyland experience feels all which is not being turned into exchange-value for and by corporations, all use-values not subject to the bottom line of "profit this year" and "as much profit as possible and the</page><page sequence="13">174 UTOPIAN STUDIES devil take the hindmost," as alien and savage: pollution finds the Amazon basin dirty. Let me mention only two further glimpses of invaded mega fields which happen to be preying on my mind these years: molecular genet ica and copyright. Alice Sheldon once complained about our world "where the raising of children yields no profit (except to television salesmen)" (45): this has been superseded by the politically shaped technology of Post Fordism. For it is politics, no doubt in tandem with atomizing possessive individualism, that enables molecular genetics businesses to patent DNA units and companies to copyright trademarks, so that one day we might have to pay royalties for having children5 as well as for using nouns and verbs such as xerox. It is inside this world-whale all of us Jonahs, Sindbads, and Nemos today live, cultivating our kale. 2. We Intellectuals in Post-Fordism You may back off from the world's woes, you're free to do so and it lies in your nature, but perhaps this backing away is precisely the only woe that you might avoid. ? Kafka, "Reflections on Sin, Woe, Hope, and the Way" "It's the economy, stupid!" ? Anon., first Clinton campaign 2.0. "Let us go then, you and I / When the evening is spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon a table / . . . like a tedious argument / Of insidious intent / To lead you to an overwhelming question ..." (T.S. Eliot) ?the question being first, "Why do we live so badly?" and second, "What orientation may get us out of it?" To restate at different level the initial question I adapted from Foucault: pragmatically, in the present to which all of us belong, "What is this present?" and "Who are we?" My working hypotheses for a first delimitation, without the ifs and buts no doubt neces sary for further understanding, are: The what is Post-Fordism; the we is intellectuals. I take the "economy, stupid!" slogan from Clinton's co-opting and obfuscatory Tweedledum campaign; but "thank thee for teaching me the word" (Shakespeare). Its salutary action-orientedness may be supplemented with the second thesis I submit to you: The barrier between so-called "cul ture" and citizenship, which today means economically based macro- and micro-politics, has been wiped out in practice by our dystopian rulers. It is time we recognized this in our laggard theory or we shall be naked unto our enemies, forced to accept them as overwhelming Destiny (that is: to shift from dystopia to horror apocalypse). There is no longer any believable Utopian social movement which we could entrust with the task of economic politics, in which we then participate as citizens but not as professionals. The comforting economic and psychic roofs (Bellamy's and Bai Ju-yi's col lective umbrella or blanket covering an entire city or province) holding us warm against the blasts of a then disputable Destiny have been torn down.</page><page sequence="14">Utopianism from Orientation to Agency 175 Therefore, Formalism?an enclave of playful creativity amid the material necessities that create consciousness, or Kantian esthetics within a Hegelo Marxist politico-economical horizon?can today only be useful as the pre liminary to a more comprehensive civic analysis, to politics in the Aristotelian and a critique of political economy in the Marxian sense. It is imperative that we realize?as the feminists have?epistemology does not function with out asking the political question "what for?" or cut bono. It is not simply that there is no useful politics without clear perception: much more intimately, interests and values decisively shape all perception. So if we grasp that the barrier between such "cultural" discussions and politics-cum-economics is simply sterile categorization and blindness, our politically and epistemologi cally corrected theory would then be only following, 15 if not 30 years late, two generational waves of SF and utopianism, from Russ and Piercy to Stan Robinson. The time for isolated formal poetics is over when the Geist has been colonized and our debates can no longer presume movements for the liberation of labour?an "existing community of praxis"?as the ground for their figures (cf. Ahmad 70, 2, and passim); I must respectfully posit as known my theoretical arguments from the first part of MOSF and most importantly from the "News" as well as the "Locus" essay, and pass on. 2.1: Post-Fordism. In a long position paper for a Luton University confer ence on SF, only a bit more than half of which has been lately printed in Foundation ("News"), I attempted an overview of Post-Fordism to which I must refer you for more detailed support. I summarize and partly develop it here. The argument is that we are at the descending part of the boom-and bust cycle. Its ascending part, that began in the 1930s, found in Fordism and Keynesianism the remedies to the dangerous 1920s' bust. These strategies effected a limited but real redistribution of wealth: Fordism through higher wages rendered possible by mass production of goods but neutralized by total production alienation and consumerist PR, Keynesianism through higher taxation neutralized by bourgeois control of the State. They functioned in feedback with the rise of production and consumption 1938-73, itself inex tricably enmeshed with imperial extraction of surplus-value, armament pro duction, and the warfare State. In class terms, Soviet pseudo-Leninism and Rooseveltian Liberalism?as well as some important aspects of fascism? were compromises with and co-optations of the pressures and revolts by plebeian or labouring classes. In economic terms they meant the institution of a modest but real "security floor" to the lowermost classes of selected "Northern" countries as well as a great expansion of middle classes, includ ing all those hearing or reading this, with a fairly comfortable financial status and an appreciable margin of maneuver for ideologico-political inde pendence. Wallerstein somewhat optimistically numbers these "[sharers] in the surplus value"?us?as 10-15% of the world population, of course dis proportionately concentrated in the richer North (Historical 123). However, the shock of 1973, when we entered upon the "bust" part of the cycle that began with the 1930s-40s boom (the oil crisis, debt crisis,</page><page sequence="15">176 UTOPIAN STUDIES global domination of the World Bank and then of the corporate credit sys tem, etc.), revealed that our planet Earth, a finite system, cannot expand indefinitely to bear 6 or 10 or 20 billion people up to the immensely waste ful "Northern" standards (see for ex. Lummis 60-74). This real emergency was seized upon and twisted by the ruling capitalists into revoking both the Keynesian compromise with the metropolitan lower classes and the Wilson ian promise to the peripheric "South." In a fierce class war from above, through a series of hidden or overt putsches by the Right wing (hidden in the "North," from Britain to the USSR, overt in the "South"?China being the pivot between the two), all protective barriers and mitigating bumpers are dismantled, so that what Marx called "the extraction of absolute surplus value" may be sharply increased: the security floor is abolished, the perma nent Fordist class of chronically poor is now enlarged beyond one third even in the rich North, while the "middle" group of classes is squeezed back into full dependency by abolishing financial security (there is a wealth of uncoordinated data on this, cf. for ex. Lash and Urry 160-68). This leads to increased world concentration of capital now dominated by cartels of "multinationals."6 Closest to home, control of the major US media had passed from 50 corporations in 1983 to 20 in 1992, so that four movie stu dios (including Disney's Buena Vista Films), five giant book publishers, and seven cable TV companies?all interlocked with major banks?produce more than half of the revenue in their field (Bagdikian ix-xii and 20-26). The dazzling surface array of diversity hides bland uniformity: there are 11,000 magazines but two /!/ magazine publishers dominate the field. . . The people running these 20 media monopolies and their bankers "consti tute a new Private Ministry of Information and Culture" (Bagdikian xxviii). Rocketing indigence and aimlessness provide the ideal breeding ground not only for petty and organized criminality?business by other means?but also for its legitimization in discrimination and ethnic hatred (for ex. in India or Yugoslavia). The warfare state had a little hiccup after the end of Cold War but it has recovered nicely (the best estimate seems to show that 2/3 of US citizens' taxes go to pay for military technology and wars, cf. Ross 4). The welfare-state transfer of wealth from one class to another goes on in spades but for the rich. The latest report to have percolated into public domain tells of the US Congress and FCC handing $70,000,000,000,000 (yes, seventybilliondollars) to the TV conglomerates in free space on public airwaves ("Bandwidth"). No wonder the number of US-dollar millionaires has from 1980 to '88 risen from 574,000 to ca. 1,300,000 (Phillips 9-10) and of billionaires 1982-96 from 13 to 149, so that the "global billionaires' club" of 450 members has a total wealth much larger than that of a group of low income countries comprising 56% of the world population {Forbes Magazine 1997, cited in Chossudovsky "Global"). Not to forget the Walt Disney corporation, its CEO Michael Eisner's salary is US$ 750,000 plus huge bonuses and stock options, while a Haitian worker is paid 6tf (six cents) for one "101 Dalmatians" children's garment ("Globaldygook")? such as probably worn by the happy Matay grandchildren. Whole genera</page><page sequence="16">Utopianism from Orientation to Agency 177 tions, as well as the planetary environment for centuries into the future, are being mortgaged to an arrogant fraction of 1% on the top and a faceless world money market. The gap between the rich "North" and the poor "South" of the world system has doubled from 1960 to 1992, with the poor "transfer ring more than $21 billion a year into the coffers of the rich" (The Econo mist, see Chomsky 62). Lowering "the cost of labour," the ultimate wisdom of capitalism, means impoverishing everybody who lives from her work and enriching top-level managers and the upper mercenaries (ranking politi cians, cops, engineers, lawyers, administrators . ..). The dire poverty gap is turning all societies into "two nations," with good services for the small minority of the rich and shoddy ones or none for the dispensable poor. Compared to Dickens, we'll have more computers, more (or at least more talk about) sex, and more cynicism for the upper classes. Human groups divide into resentful islands who do not hear the bell tolling; Marx's "abso lute general law of capitalist accumulation: accumulation of wealth is at the same time accumulation of misery, agony of toil, slavery, ignorance, brutal ity" (Selected 483), has been confirmed in spades. What then is the balance sheet of the capitalist social formation (cf . Waller stein, Historical 99-105 and 117-37)? Let me take the two most undoubted material achievements: production and length of life. As to the first, it is clear that human domination over nature has mightily increased: per unit of labour-time, the output of products is considerably greater. In other words, technological productivity under capitalism has finally created the presup positions for rendering our globe habitable for all. But the habitability has been hijacked: is the required labour-time for production and reproduction per one person, per one lifetime or in the aggregate smaller? Certainly, in comparison to precapitalist formations the working classes "work much harder in order to merely scrape by; they may eat less, but they surely buy more" (ibidem 124): Paul Lafargue's right to creative laziness is nowhere on the horizon. In the last 30 years, at the same time that a fake decoloniza tion redrew political borders outside the metropolitan countries, from Ghana to the Ucraine, "the world proletariat has almost doubled . . . [much of it] working under conditions of gross exploitation and political oppression" (Harvey 423). There is a serious possibility that the classical Marxist thesis of the absolute immiseration of the proletariat as compared to 500 or 200 years ago may after all be correct, if we look at the 85% or more of the working people in the world economy rather than only at the industrial workers of the metropolitan countries; and there is no doubt of the huge rel ative immiseration in comparison to the dominant classes and nations. Obviously, even the latter is politically quite explosive and morally unac ceptable: it demoralizes and alienates all classes, if in different ways. As to the second, infant mortality has been strongly reduced in peace time: but have the pollutions of air, water, and food as well as the psychic stresses and unceasing compulsion and insecurity lengthened life for those who survived beyond cared-for infancy? The jury is out on this: but the quality and ease of life has surely fallen sharply within my lifetime, and it is</page><page sequence="17">178 UTOPIAN STUDIES bound to fall exponentially with structural long-term unemployment. The amount of social waste and cruelty is larger than ever before in the century beginning with the great capitalist world wars (1914). "[CJapitalism cannot deliver world peace" (Wood 265): we'll be very lucky if we have no further ABC wars after the Gulf Oil one. Capitalism is positively dependent on eco logical devastation, condensing geological change into historical time. True, "really existing socialism" also badly failed at this (not at keeping peace); but ecological vandalism is a measure of capitalism's success, not failure: the more vandalism the more short-term profit (look at Amazonia). So I asked in "News": is our overheated society better than the "colder" one of (say) Tang China or the Iroquois Confederation? There's more of us but do we have more space or more trees, per person? Many of us have less back breaking toil, but all have more mind-destroying aimlessness resulting in person-killing by drug and gun; we have WCs but also cancer and AIDS. . . . Most probably, even quantitatively?and with greater certainty qualita tively?the achievements of the bourgeoisie celebrated in The Communist Manifesto have been overbalanced by what it has suppressed. One example of the very ambiguous balance sheet would be universal ism and science. I discuss the latter in some detail in my Luton study, and can here only telegraphically note that, while I wish to keep its cognitive orientation toward the systematic and testable understanding of material processes, it is also an institution both legitimating and disciplining the world's cadres, and its subsumption under profit-oriented rationalism has caused a horrified massive reaction into irrationalism. And the destruction of local communities, knowledges, and living species from Columbus on is irreparable. For Homo sapiens and the planet, the price of drug, gun, and profits is too high. 2.2: Intellectuals. Post-Fordism is, then, the apparently final moulting of capitalism from individual into corporate. Where Fordism was characterized by "hard" technology, semi-automation, State planning, and the rise of mass media and advertising, Post-Fordism brings "soft" technology, automation, mega-corporations and world market regulation, as well as the integration of the media with the computer under total domination of marketing. In both cases, more "software" or "human engineering" people were needed to ensure not only production but also supervision and ideological updating of the ruling hegemony. One of the 20th Century's earmarks is therefore the enormous multiplication and enormous institutionalization or collectiviza tion of the earlier "petty bourgeoisie," the independent artisan and small entrepreneur?"not all justified by the social necessities of production [but] by the political necessities of the dominant [class]" (Gramsci 13). These "new middle classes" comprise roughly everybody who works largely sitting down but does not employ other people: it is in fact a congerie of social classes including teachers, office workers, salespeople, the so-called "free" profes sions, etc. Often classified as part of a "service" sector, they could be prop erly called "the salaried classes." Their non-managerial core is constituted</page><page sequence="18">Utopianism from Orientation to Agency 179 by "intellectuals," largely university graduates (but cf. more precisely the pioneering Mills book, Noble, and the Ehrenreichs), people who work mainly with images and/or concepts and, among other functions, "produce, distrib ute and preserve distinct forms of consciousness" (Mills 142). Hobsbawm calculates that two thirds of the GNP in the societies of the capitalist North are now derived from their labour, though their proportion within the popu lation is much inferior, globally perhaps 10-15%. Politically, they (we) may be very roughly divided into servants of the capitalist and/or bureaucratic state, of large corporations, self-proclaimedly "apolitical" or "esthetic" free floaters, and radicals taking the plebeian side; the alliance of the first and fourth group with some non-"intellectual" classes determined both the origi nal Leninism and New Deal. In the Fordist dispensation, liberal ideology claimed that the world is composed of inner-directed atomic individuals within atomic national States, all of which can and will achieve infinite progress in riches by means of technology in a competitive market. It is actually this intermediate class congerie in the world, the Ehrenreichs' "professional-managerial class" (a nomination that usefully underlines their two wings), that has beyond doubt been materially better off than their earlier historical counterparts: but the price has been very high. The new collectivism, while mouthing Liberal slo gans stripped of the State worship, needs other-directed intellectuals. Post Fordism has had quite some success in making intellectual "services" more marketable, a simulacrum of profit-making. This was always the case in sci ences and engineering: industrial production since ca. the 1880s is the story of how "the capitalist, having expropriated the worker's property, gradually expropriated his technical knowledge as well" (Lasch xi, and see Noble). In the age of World Wars this sucks in law, medicine, and "soft-science" con sulting in the swarms of "professional expertise" mercenaries. Now, in the polarized and non-Keynesian situation, those who buck the market better get themselves to a nunnery. The class aggressions by big corporations against the immediate producers, corporeal and intellectual, means that Jack London's dystopian division of workers under the Iron Heel into a minority of indispensable Mercenaries and a mass of downtrodden proletarians (updated, say, by Piercy in He, She and It) has a good chance of being real ized. The PoMo variant, where the proles buy in the local supermarket the hand-me-down Guccis they've seen on the idiot box model-parades while the mercenaries live in Aspen and commute through cyberspace, does not invalidate this early Modernist diagnosis ("labour aristocracy" in Lenin's language), rather it incorporates all the talk about status. This is where it might be useful to delve further into the Faustian two souls of us intellectuals. It would require complex adaptations of Marxian class theory (cf. to begin with Gramsci, the Ehrenreichs, Poulantzas, Resnick Wolff, Guillory, and Robbins ed.) which would take into account a group's relation to both economics and to power and cultural positioning; I can only hope to identify the problem. On the one hand, as Marx famously chided, "the bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured</page><page sequence="19">180 UTOPIAN STUDIES and looked up to with reverent awe. It has turned the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the scientist, into its paid wage-labourers" (The Commu nist Manifesto). On the other hand, the constitution of the intellectuals into professions is impossible without a measure of autonomy: of corporative self-government and, most important, control over one's work. No doubt, this constitution was enabled by the fact that salaried men and women are "the assistants of authority" (Mills 74), but no authority can abide without their assistance. The socialist tradition from Marx through Lenin to Buk harin, Gramsci, and Brecht has therefore always oscillated between praising the intelligentsia?for example the students?as the conscious interpreter of social contradictions and chastizing it with scorpions as the producer of fake consciousness; the Marxists rightly?if as a rule rather schematically?saw in this a homology to the intellectuals' ambiguous status of limited auton omy (cf. for one example Lenin's polemic with Bernstein, 208-09). We share to an exasperated degree the tug-of-war between wage-labour and self-determination: "[the middle class] individuals live or attempt to live an elite life, evading through 'culture,' while their knowledge serves capital ism. . . .They live a double life . . ., inside the 'system' but with alibis, ... in a jouissance half real and half illusionary" (Lefebvre 32-33). Even the poorest intellectual participates in privilege through her "educational capital"; even the richest manager may not be able to rid himself of the uncomfortable itch of thinking. The increasingly marginalized and pauper ized humanists and teachers are disproportionately constituted by women and non-"Whites," a sure index of subalternity. To the contrary, what Debray calls the reproductive or distributive intellectuals (95 and passim)?the engineers of material and human resources, the admen and "design" profes sionals, the new bishops and cardinals of the media clerisy, most lawyers, as well as the teeming swarms of supervisors (we teachers are increasingly adjunct policemen keeping the kids off the streets)?are the Post-Fordist "organic" mercenaries, whom PoMo cynicism has dispensed from alibis. Bourdieu has intriguingly described intellectuals as "a dominated frac tion of the dominant class" ("Intellectual" 145 and Other 319ff.; cf. Guillory 118ff.). Such semi-Foucauldian brilliancies are too monolithic and undialec tical for my taste, but it is true that the funds for this whole congerie of "cadre" classes?"administrators, technicians, scientists, educators. . . . have been drawn from the global surplus" (Wallerstein, Historical 83-84): as Sartre would say, none of us has clean hands. (I myself seem to be paid through loans to Quebec by German banks, or ultimately by the exploitation of my ex-compatriots in Eastern Europe.) It is also true that the welfare and-warfare State epoch saw the culmination of the "cut" from the global surplus we "middle" 10-15% were getting; and "the shouts of triumph of this 'middle' sector over the reduction of their gap with the upper one per cent have masked the realities of the growing gap between them and the other [85-90] per cent" (ibidem 104-05). So Bourdieu is getting at our oxy moronic position of a living contradiction: we are essential to the encadre ment and policing of workers, but we are ourselves workers?a position</page><page sequence="20">Utopianism from Orientation to Agency 181 memorably encapsulated by Brecht's "Song of the [Tame] Eighth Elephant" helping to subdue his recalcitrant natural brethren in The Good Person of Setzuan. Excogitating ever new ways to sell our expertise as "services" in producing and enforcing marketing images of happiness, we decisively con tribute to the decline of people's self-determination and non-professional ized expertise (cf. Fox and Lears 9 and passim). We are essential to the production of new knowledge and ideology, but we are totally kept out of establishing the framework into which, and mostly kept from directing the uses to which, the production and the producers are put. Our professional ization secured for some of us sufficient income to turn high wage into min uscule capital. We cannot function without a good deal of self-government in our classes or artefacts, but we do not control the strategic decisions about universities or dissemination of artefacts. The list of such variants to Dr. Dolittle's twoheaded Pushme-Pullyou beast, between self-management and servitude, could be extended indefinitely. 3. The Bifurcations and the Alliances The starting-point in critical elaboration is the consciousness of what one really is ... as a product of the historical process to date, which has deposited in you an infinity of traces, without leaving an inventory. Therefore, it is imperative at the outset to compile an inventory. ? Gramsci, Prison Notebooks 3.1. The main realization dawning from the preceding subsections is for me, following arguments such as Wallerstein's, that the hope for an eventual bridging of the poverty gap is now over, and it is very improbable the Key nesian class compromise can be dismantled without burying under its fall out capitalism as a whole. Will this happen explosively, for example in a quite possible Third World War, or by a slow "crumbling away" which would generate massive breakdowns of civil and civilized relations, on the model of the present "cold civil war" smouldering in the US, which are (as Disch's forgotten masterpiece 334 rightly saw) only comparable to daily life in the late Roman Empire? And what kind of successor formation will then be coming about? The age of individualism and free market is over, the pres ent is already highly collectivized, and demographics as well as insecurity will make the future even more so: the alternative lies between the models of the oligarchic (that is centrally Fascist) warcamp and an open plebeian democratic commune (cf. Wagner 38ff. and passim). In this realistically grim perspective, a strong argument could be made that facing a dangerous series of "cascading bifurcations" (Wallerstein, His torical 155-56) our liberatory corporate or class interests as intellectuals are twofold and interlocking. First, they consist in securing a high degree of self-management, to begin with in the workplace. But second, they also con sist in working for such strategic alliances with other fractions and classes as would consent us to fight the current toward militarized browbeating.</page><page sequence="21">182 UTOPIAN STUDIES This may be most visible in "Confucian capitalism" from Japan to Malaya, for example in the concentration-camp fate of the locked-in young women in industries of Mainland China, but it is well represented in all our sweat shops and fortress neighbourhoods (see the US example in Harvey). It can only be counteracted by ceaseless insisting on meaningful democratic par ticipation in the control not only of production but also of distribution of our own work, as well as of our neighbourhoods. Here the boundary between our as it were dissident interests within the intellectual field of production and the overall liberation of labour as their only guarantee becomes perme able. True, history has shown that alliance-building is only more painful than base organizing: any Mannheimian dream about the intelligentsia as Utopian arbiter was unrealistic to begin with. But at least we know it can only be done by bringing into the marriage our honest interests and uncertain ties, by eschewing like the plague the PoMo certainty and apodictic terroriz ing, adapted in a bizarre mimicry of their two rivals, admass and Stalinism, as the newest variant of the intellectuals' illusion that they do not suffer from illusions (as Bourdieu somewhere said). Our immediate interests are oppositional because capitalism without a human face is obviously engaged in large scale "structural declassing" of intellectual work, of our "cultural capital" (Bourdieu, and cf. Guillory 134ff.). There is nothing more humiliating, short of physical injury, than the experi ence of being pushed to the periphery of social values?measured by the only yardstick capitalism knows, our financing?which all of us have under gone in the last quarter century. Our graduate students are by now predomi nantly denied Keynesian employment, condemned to part-time piecework without security. As Poulantzas observes, capitalism has now adjoined to the permanent reserve army of industrial labour that of intellectual labour (321-23). The new contract enforced on the "downsized" generation is: "Workers undertake to find new occupations where they can be exploited in the cleverest and most efficient way possible" (Lipietz 77). If the degree of autonomy within the "middle class" is inversely proportional to a given fraction's domination over workers, so that managers have little autonomy but great powers over workers (including intellectual workers), then univer sity teachers never had any power over productive relations, but now we are bit by bit losing our relatively large autonomy. The difference between intel lectuals and managers is analogous to that of monks to territorial priests in the medieval Catholic Church. The best we can today expect from capital ism is the shrinking and proletarianized plastic-tower autonomy of a beg ging order: the badly supplied but relatively undisturbed monastery of Thomas of Aquinas?certainly not the Abbey of Theleme, beset as it is by an unholy alliance of barbaric businessmen and what Gayatri C. Spivak (in Robbins ed. 167) calls "corporate feminists" (or corporate ethnics). This is not good enough. 3.2. In this bind, we can at any rate say to the supposed realists (Haug, Ver such 88-89): Look where you've landed us! There's no more realism with</page><page sequence="22">Utopianism from Orientation to Agency 183 out Utopia! (Your reality itself works toward a negative Utopia.) But what does this practically mean? A number of things. First, I must be the bearer of painful news: the professionalism of which we were up to a point justly proud has been overwhelmingly corrupted?by outright bribery where it matters, by self-willed marginality in the humani ties. The ivory of our towers has been largely ground into powder as aphro disiac for the corporate bosses and enchantment for the elder Matay sibs. Looking at our class position soberly, we shall have to redefine profession alism as including?rather than complementing?self-managing political citizenship or we shall be political by selling our brains to the highest bid der. This follows necessarily from the above discussions of epistemology and our class position, which are now revealed as two ways of envisaging the same thing. On the one hand, in our classes we shall have to redefine, with Nietzsche, philology not simply as the art of reading rightly (what is there) but the art of reading well (what we may get from it). And outside the class it may mean anything from picketing the University Board or the Fac ulty of Business Management to lying down on the railway tracks (to use an improbable 60s' parallel). It certainly means striving for activist unioniza tion, at a time when corporations are corrupting academic administrators by making them into well-paid CEOs in exchange for downsizing teachers (see Soley 24-32 and Guillory). Like publishers vs. artistic cognition, universi ties vs. teaching cognition are now "the swine ... in charge of the pearls" (Anthony). As Benjamin put it, in the permanent part of an essay which was alas written in a more hopeful situation: .. . only by transcending the specialization in the process of production that, in the bourgeois view, constitutes its order can one make this production politi cally useful; and the barriers imposed by specialization must be breached jointly by the productive forces that they were set up to divide. The author as producer discovers?in discovering his solidarity with the proletariat?simulta neously his solidarity with certain other producers who earlier seemed scarcely to concern him. (230) Only this can, in his wonderful polysemy, unfetter die Produktion der Intel ligenz: the production of us intellectuals, but also the productivity of intel ligence or reason. And if we at the moment don't find many proletarian organizations to meet us in the middle of the tunnel, we can start by doing Utopian cross-pollinations of at least the cultural with the philosophic, eco nomic, political, and other history studies. To wax unabashedly autobiograph ical, this is one of the reasons why I'm a member of the Society for Utopian Studies; or why I consider Attali's book on the political economy of music (the age of repetitive evacuation of meaning and big centralized apparati determining production and listening as commodified time, best fore grounded in muzak) as one of the most enlightening diagnoses of Post Fordism; or why my latest book interlards seven essays and seven sequences of poetry. But I'm afraid we'll have to relearn the tradition of persecution ranging, say, from Cyrano and Spinoza, through Marx's and Benjamin's exile from universities and many countries, to the Pope's treatment of Lib</page><page sequence="23">184 UTOPIAN STUDIES eration Theology: such ecumenic professionalism will entail less reading of papers and much more civic conflictuality. For, on the citizenship end of the same continuous spectrum it means beginning to fight two even more difficult long revolutions. One is to mas ter what we might call, adapting Said, critical worldliness: Brecht called it the art of thinking also in other people's heads. Though we partly become intellectuals in order to get far from the madding crowd, our class and often even personal survival requires us then (now)?without surrendering either our bearings or the clarity of our arguments' articulation!? to get out of the elite ghetto of writing, theatre, etc., into the mass media. The most impor tant politico-cultural position today is obviously the TV station, secondly the radio station, and thirdly the cinema and the video production. This is why they are also, in descending order, the most firmly controlled by mil lions and laws. Nonetheless, there may be limited chinks in the system, as proved by the stories of the three-kilometer-radius Japanese radio stations, or of the movie producing units at the end of "real socialism" in East Cen tral Europe?both successfully used by small self-governing groups. Video production, and in particular computerization and the Internet offer many possibilities, so far used by the Rightwing subversives much more efficiently than by the Left. The second long struggle might be called global solidarity: it consists in fighting what would be a Fascist geopolitical involution, turn ing our privileged Northern continents into an insular Festung Amerika and Festung West-Europa. The Japanese dissident Muto Ichiyo called it perhaps more precisely "transborder participatory democracy," and Douglas Lum mis argues on his tracks that it is a necessity of our time when "imperial power is incarnated in three bodies: pseudo-democracy at home, vast mili tary organizations, and the transnational corporations ..." (Lummis 138). Its furthest Utopian horizon, absolutely necessary if we wish to avoid obliv ion or caste society, is the long revolution of achieving "democratic forms of 'social control' of financial markets" (Chossudovsky "IMF"). In sum, the Modernist oases for exiles (the Left Bank, Bloomsbury, lower Manhattan, major US campuses) are gone the way of a Tahiti polluted by nuclear fallout and venereal pandemic: some affluent or starving writers ? la Pynchon or Joyce may still be possible, but not as a statistically signifi cant option for us. Adapting Tsvetaeva's great line "All poets are Jews" (Vse poety zhidy), we can say that fortunately all intellectuals are partly exiles from the Disneyland and/or starvation dystopia, but we are an "inner emigration" for whom resistance was always possible and is now growing mandatory. The only resistance to Disneyland brainwashing is "the inven tion of the desire called Utopia in the first place, along with new rules for the fantasizing or daydreaming of such a thing?a set of narrative protocols with no precedent in our previous literary institutions ..." (Jameson, Seeds 90). This would be a collective production of meanings, whose efficacy is measured by "[how many] consumers it is able to turn into producers" (Ben jamin, "Author" 233, and cf. Attali): that is, to begin with, critical and not empathetic thinkers. And the only chance to do this is "[to keep] in touch</page><page sequence="24">Utopianism from Orientation to Agency 185 with all kinds of streams of protest and dissent so as to know what's impor tant to say" (Ehrenreich 177-78, and cf. passim). And a final piece of pain ful news: this means "doing things we're not used to, like saying things that 'everybody' (meaning everybody in one wing of the profession) 'already knows'" (Berube 171, and cf. the whole section 164-78, esp. 176). The gentle reader will notice I haven't quite managed to follow this prescription . . . 3.3. Mindful of my Marxian roots, I shall not venture into prophecies about the next generation or two. You can find it better in the dystopian SF I've already alluded to. But I wish to report that I find two of the best "concep tual" people, Raymond Williams from the humanities and Immanuel Waller stein from the social sciences (Historical 162-63), quite independently (such is our bourgeois division of labour that even they, on the same politi cal side in the same language, appear not to have read each other!) coming to a practically identical view of alternatives to capitalist commercialism. They are: Platonic Fascism (authoritarianism), the Guardians being maybe half or less of the affluent 10-20% in the North of the globe; Neo-feudalism (paternalism), distinguished from the former by a significant breakdown in globalization and division into local satrapies of different kinds; and finally, federated self-governing communes and work-groups (participatory democ racy), a technologized Morrisian Nowhere as the nearest approximation to classless society we may today dream of. And we also have a good yardstick for measuring any change as it occurs: does it increase or reduce the exploi tation of labour, of production in the widest sense (that includes art and love, cf. Suvin, "Brecht"). Again, against the horizon of these blue distances the production of goods and the production of meanings grows indistinguishable. To conclude: we have no choice but to propose the most daring Utopia, which is today, to begin with, not Earthly Paradise but the prevention of Hell on Earth. May the Earth remain our habitable mother, rather than being pushed by greedy class and imbecilitated masses (as today) the way of eco logical catastrophe, and the ensuing great Migration of Peoples, the bitter State and corporation wars, the civil wars of constructed racism and ethnic ity! But paradoxically, I am persuaded that finally?which is not at all opposed to other medium-range horizons?only the most radical counter poise, a flexible system of what Marx called the free association of direct producers, the horizon of a global self-sustaining and self-managing soci ety?which is socialism?, has a chance: only mobilizing Paradise or Utopia can Hell or Fascism be defeated. Fuller's slogan "utopia or oblivion" can be interpreted to mean the threatening loss of historical memory for almost all that distinguishes our horizons from a caste society. Yet, of course, when the status quo collapses, the bifurcations are unforeseeable. Behind the alternative between Utopia and disastrous being there lurks Utopia vs. non-being. The alternative to a habitable planet is not only the present creeping death of the mind and values but sweeping and totally non-metaphoric death. At any rate, as Brecht wrote in the dark little poem on reading Horace's account of the Great Deluge:</page><page sequence="25">186 UTOPIAN STUDIES Even the Deluge Did not last for ever. At some point The black waters receded. And yet, how few people Lasted that long! (GW 10:1014) So: having arrived within hailing distance of the end of our species and per haps of vertebrate life on Earth, the wonderful but possibly somewhat elite form of the scholarly essay begins at the end to fail me. I shall therefore try to encapsulate what I had to say here in five slogans (aided by Haug, Ver such 89 and 498, and Moylan): No way out of dystopia except as orientation to Utopia?and viceversa. No epistemology (perceiving, understanding, culture) without politics?and viceversa. No social liberation without self-management (in workplace as well as all other places)?and viceversa. No democracy without (the best from) socialism, ecology, and feminism?and triply viceversa. "And if you think this is Utopian, please think why is it such." (Brecht) And the one-but-last slogan above leads me to say, in parting, that in my experience to have either Marxists or Marxians is not enough for socialism, and to have socialism is not enough for self-management. Not even the slo gan's Holy Quaternity is enough: our Utopian pantheon of Supreme Goods should be flexibly polytheistic. But: there is no full and sustainable self management without socialism?"the primary 'active Utopia'" not only "of modern times" (Goodwin and Taylor 149), but with due modifications the inescapable spouse of any consistent, radical Utopia; and no full and sustain able socialism without the fundamental Utopian and critically anti-dystopian insights of Karl Marx. Utopia as static goal has been dead since the 19th Century, even if its putrefying cadaver poisoned the 20th. Marx's critique of Cabet's project of emigrating to found a colony as desertion from class struggles (and I find it rather significant that Marx did not focus on criticizing Cabet's earlier? rather poor?Utopian novel), could have taught us that "the place of Utopia is not elsewhere, but here and now, as other" (Marin 346). As Calvino's "city which cannot be founded by us but can found itself within us, can build itself bit by bit in our capacity to imagine it, to think it through" (252), Utopia cannot die. But its latent rebirth depends on us. I give you what I have learned in this truncated half century, through hope and terror and finally compassionate solidarity (the karuna of Huxley's Buddhist mynah birds, the ironic tenderness of Brecht): Do not expect from Utopia more than from yourselves.</page><page sequence="26">Utopianism from Orientation to Agency 187 NOTES 1. My thanks go to Peter Fitting and Lyman Tower Sargent for generously organizing a ses sion devoted to discussing this, and to the latter for help with sources on hunger statistics. Also to Farah Mendlesohn and Tom Moylan for comments on a first draft, and to David Mclnerney for reawakening my interest in Macherey. All translations from non-English titles in the Works Cited are mine. Since I did my survey on at least the definitional aspect of Utopia a quarter of century ago, there has come about a huge amount of secondary literature both directly and indirectly (methodologically) dealing with Utopia?not only in English but also (to mention the richest European traditions) German, Italian, and French. It is well-known to most of us, but I wish today to exercise a creative forgetfulness in regard to it. For, my project is to focus not so much on a "horizontally" self-enclosed tradition (which is in part operative as generic mem ory and in good part constructed by us formalizing critics) as it is, primarily and perhaps right now even exclusively, to concentrate on the "vertical" interplay of Utopian horizons, existents, and events with the "thick" experience of endangered living together in Post-Fordism. None theless it ought to be apparent that my thinking is centrally stimulated and modified not only by the "indirect" masters such as Barthes, Hall, Jameson or Williams, but also by the "direct" critics from (say) Bauman to Zamyatin (I find it interesting that most of the first category have also committed some direct writing on utopia/nism). 2. A theme I wish I had spacetime to develop here is on intellectuals as the memory bump of society. I find obscene the phrase by Agnes Heller, born out of anti-utopian panic: "The his tory of the dead is dead history" (A Philosophy of History in Fragments, Oxford: Blackwell, 1993, 40). On the contrary, all sense of history is consubstantial with the actuality or fear of death (of the past, but also of the future), the longing in "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem ... !" 3. Marin 298; cf. also some shrewd observations on the representativity of Disneyland by Baudrillard, Eco, and by the PoMo architect Venturi who however feels much more at home in it. The first and probably still the shrewdest critic of the "pleasure industry," its rise in the world expositions and fairs, its induction of the dream-world of mass culture and affinities to fascism, as well as its connection with the salaried employee class that produces information/ entertainment/persuasion, was Walter Benjamin; cf. on Mickey Mouse as a "figure of the col lective dream" the still much too optimistic first version of "The Work of Art. ..," GS 1: 462, and the excellent overview in Buck-Morss, esp. 83-99, 253-84, 303-17, and 322-27. 4. Is it necessary to say that I find much to interest and delight me in utopological writing, and that I have, of course, no objection to pragmatic delimitation of any field according to the delimiters' interest, but only wish then to reserve the right to judge that interest? Yet in fact nowadays we not only meet a "pure Utopia" as often as an okapi, but also (because?) to isolate the (or a) political organization from the rest of world seems self-defeating. 5. Cf. Chomsky 112-13. This hyperbole is likely to be literally true if we specify "healthy" or even "normal life-expectancy" children. This whole matter of so-called TRIPS (Trade-related Intellectual Property Rights) is an extremely important, threatening, and neglected spearhead of corporate aggression into the most intimate areas of everybody's life-world, which is? through extension of patent-law logic (for genetically engineered food, seeds, micro-organ isms, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals) to copyright laws, including trademarks?also sucking in language. 6. As I add this note in January 1998, the newest such case, the IMF "bailout" of South Korea, means in practice a cut in half in wages expressed in US$, huge unemployment of employees and bankruptcies of small businesses, opening the door to takeover of Korean banks by foreign finance, strong reduction in government spending on social programs, infras tructure, and credits to business, fracturing of the large domestic conglomerates?in brief, a whole thriving "high tech and manufacturing economy up for grabs" (Chossudovsky "IMF").</page><page sequence="27">188 UTOPIAN STUDIES REFERENCES Ahmad, Aijaz.
