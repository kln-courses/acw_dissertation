Several Church Fathers tell of a Jewish-Christian sect whose members settled in Pella, east of the Jordan, a few years before the capture of Jerusalem, where they had formerly dwelt. They are called variously Ebionites or Nazoreans, sometimes by other names. The extensive researches on this sect by modern scholars are summarized in this learned work, which carries the inquiry forward to a more advanced stage. In addition to the incomplete and sometimes con- tradictory reports in patristic sources, the author has utilized the extant frag- ments of Symmachus the Bible translator (who was the outstanding Ebionite scholar), pertinent Rabbinic passages, and the enigmatic writings known as the clementina. These last present a complicated and controversial critical problem. The view of the "Tiibingen school" that they are early writings of the Jewish- Christian church is untenable; but Schoeps strongly supports those who hold that one of the sources of the Clementines is a second century Ebionite document, large portions of which can be identified. Prof. Schoeps' conclusions (in brief and sketchy summary) are as follows: The conflict between Paul and the Church of Jerusalem headed by James the brother of Jesus-as recorded in the New Testament-was an early stage of the struggle which ultimately led the Jewish-Christian group to withdraw from the developing Catholic Church. But not all the doctrines of the second century Ebionites were necessarily held by their great heroes, James and Simon Peter. The Ebionites regarded Jesus as the Messiah, the "Son of Man" of the apocalypses, above all as the true prophet, the new Moses. They denied his divinity and rejected the virgin birth. His Messiahship dated from his baptism. His basic function was to teach: he restored the Torah of the true prophets Adam, Abraham, Moses (who foretold his coming in Denit. 18:15). His death had no metaphysical consequences. The Ebionites rejected vehemently the doctrines of the "apostate" Paul. Jesus, they insisted, came not to abolish but to fulfill the Law. But the Torah in its present form contains later additions which are not according to God's will. These include the entire sacrificial legislation, all anthropomorphic passages, all narratives which cast aspersions on the character of the patriarchs or Moses. But the "genuine" portions of the law, such as the commandment of cir- cumcision, were rigidly observed. The Ebionites were much more stringent than the Pharisees. They practiced vegetarianism, glorified poverty, and were fanati- cally meticulous in maintaining ceremonial purity. They laid great stress on baptism. Prof. Schoeps carefully distinguishes between Ebionites and Elkesaites, sects which have been confused both by ancient and modern writers. The Elkesaites</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 255 were a Gnostic group which adopted certain Ebionite doctrines. But the genuine Ebionites were not Gnostic; they bitterly opposed Marcion, though their doctrine that sections of the Torah are later interpolations may have been called forth by his criticism. The Ebionites are also to be distinguished from such Jewish- Christians as the author of the Epistle of James, who did not withdraw from the main bbdy of the Church. The Ebionites sought to convert the pagans; but they required circumcision and the acceptance of their modified Torah for admission to their community. Estranged from both Judaism and the Christian Church, they ceased to exist as a separate sect after a few centuries. But their ideas were transmitted by other heretical groups, and some of them were eventually incorporated into Islam. Readers of this journal may be particularly interested in the author's use of Rabbinic material bearing on minim and poshe's yisrael, terms which at least sometimes refer to Jewish-Christians. Schoeps here follows the lead of earlier investigators, notably Marmorstein. His own suggestions in this area are frequently plausible, though many remain at best ingenious conjecture. Indeed, he himself emphasizes throughout the study that the paucity of source material compels the investigator to propose many hypotheses that cannot at present be proved. The book is extremely thorough, carefully documented, and provided with indices and with several supplementary sections. It is worth noting that it is the work of a Jew, the only important Jewish scholar now working in Germany. He is interested not only in the historical, but also in the systematic and contem- porary relationships between Christianity and Judaism (see Commentary, February 1950). New York City. BERNARD J.
