JANE YOUNG Images of Power and the Power of Images The Significance of Rock Art for Contemporary Zunis FOR THE CONTEMPORARY ZUNI1 INDIANS of New Mexico verbal and visual arts constitute interrelated communicative codes. This interrelationship is revealed in the way that these codes are used to "re-create" and structure the world- particularly the world of myth time-and to provide frameworks for the trans- formation of meanings. Here, I explore the ways that some of the rock art im- ages in the environs of Zuni Pueblo are perceived as meaningful and powerful, both because of qualities inherent in those visual images themselves and also because of their relationships to other aspects of the Zuni world. Certain im- ages, generally quite representational and produced in more recent times, depict beings that the Zunis associate with vital aspects of the physical world and call upon for aid in achieving various desired ends. Other images are often seen as relating to events in the Zuni origin myth which describes the emergence of the people from the four underworlds and their search for the center. These images, generally somewhat older and more ambiguous in design, have the power to evoke traditional narratives about the events depicted or, more generally, about the "time of the beginning." Still other images consist of geometric designs and other relatively older, amorphous figures. Though the latter are unintelligible to contemporary Zunis, they are still considered powerful, meaningful, and important. The Zunis regard these images as messages from the ancestors, which, though no longer decipherable, remain "signs from the past." This paper focuses on the ways in which rock art images, like other features of the Zuni landscape, are drawn into the net- work of symbolic associations that serves to make their environment meaning- ful to the Zunis. Continuity and Change: The Ethnographic Perspective Over the past one hundred years or so, a number of anthropologists have described the "ways" of the Zuni people, their rituals, and beliefs (e.g., Benedict 1935; Bunzel 1929, 1932; Cushing 1882, 1883, 1896, 1920; Fewkes 1891; Parsons 1917, 1923, 1939; M. Stevenson 1887, 1898, 1904; D. Tedlock Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 98, No. 387, 1985 Copyright ? 1985 by the Americain Folklore Society 0021-8715/85/3870003-46$5.10/1</page><page sequence="2">M. JANE YOUNG 1979).2 This ethnographic record shows that despite much contact with the Anglo- or Euro-American culture during the recent past, Zuni demonstrates considerable continuity between its past and present. The pueblo today has a population of over 7000, most of whom describe themselves as full-blooded Zuni Indians. Though many, particularly those of middle-age or younger, are fluent in English, Zuni is still the language of social discourse. Zuni social, religious, economic, and political systems are all closely intertwined (Ladd 1979). According to Eggan, the "outstanding feature of social life" for all of the western Pueblo groups, Zuni included, is their division into matrilineal clans, each named or given a totem "after some object or aspect of nature" (1950:62).3 Despite the harsh and sometimes desert-like climate of this region, agricul- ture played a central role historically in the subsistence economy at Zuni, and religious activities came to focus primarily on ensuring sufficient rain for the crops. Thus, one of the principal duties and responsibilities of the Zuni priest- hoods and religious societies has been to act as mediators between the Zuni people and those beings, especially kachinas, who have the power to bring rain and, more generally, to confer prosperity in all areas of life. While many Zunis are affiliated with one or another Christian group, this generally does not preclude their continued membership in the traditional Zuni religious societies nor their participation in the ceremonies of those societies. The largest of these societies is the Kachina Society into which most males are initiated at or about the time of puberty. The members of this society, divided into six kiva groups, are responsible for impersonating the kachinas (masked gods) and conducting the ceremonies that implore these powerful beings to help the Zunis achieve their desired ends. The most visible aspect of the complex cycle of Zuni ritual ceremonies, the part that "outsiders" are allowed to view, consists of the public performances of the sacred kachina dances by masked dancers in the pueblo's plazas. Much of our remaining knowledge about the Zuni socio- religious system is based on the work of such early anthropologists at Zuni as Frank H. Cushing (1882) and Matilda C. Stevenson (1904). These anthropol- ogists witnessed ceremonies that are inaccessible to us today and even drew and photographed many of these ceremonies and the sacred ritual items associated with them, such as the altars, wall murals, and sand paintings of kivas and medicine society rooms. Anthropologists have also studied other, more accessible items of material culture at Zuni, including pottery (Bunzel 1929; Cushing 1886; J. Stevenson 1883, 1884), jewelry (Adair 1944), paintings (Tanner 1973:290-300), fetishes (Cushing 1883; Kirk 1943), masks (Bunzel 1932:837-1086; M. Stevenson 1898), and ceremonial paraphernalia (Bunzel 1932:837-1086), the latter two in the context of their use in ceremonies open to outsiders. More recently, scholars have focused on "aesthetic activities" rather than on isolated items of material culture, studying kachina songs and dances and ritual poetry and nar- ratives (B. Tedlock 1973, 1980; D. Tedlock 1972; Young 1978) as part of an overall system of Zuni aesthetics and world view. 4</page><page sequence="3">IMAGES OF POWER Prior to my own work, however, no study of Zuni material culture or of their aesthetic system more generally has taken a serious look at the rock art surrounding the pueblo or at what the Zunis say about it.4 Early anthropol- ogists and archaeologists scarcely mention the rock art, and scholars have only recently begun to include it in the ethnographic record. My own fieldwork at Zuni, however, has convinced me that rock art remains an important part of Zuni culture and that the investigation of Zuni perceptions of the rock art im- ages and their attitudes toward and treatment of the rock art sites surrounding the pueblo can help us gain some understanding of Zuni aesthetics and world view. Rock Art in the Zuni Environs The Pueblo of Zuni, located in western New Mexico, is situated in an open valley surrounded on three sides by cliffs. For over a thousand years the sharply rising mottled and banded walls of these cliffs have formed natural "canvases" for rock art images.5 Such images are, in general, created by means of two basic techniques: engraving (petroglyphs) and painting (pictographs). Specific engraving techniques include: (1) pecking-striking the stone with a sharp piece of harder rock or using a hammerstone and rock chisel (Figure 1); (2) in- cising, gouging, and scratching-carving lines of varying depth in the rock with a sharp object (Figure 2); (3) abrading-rubbing or scraping with a harder stone in order to create a smooth surface (Figure 2); and (4) drilling-the rotational movement of an object, often metal, to produce small round holes in the rock surface. Pictographs are made by using many kinds of brushes and drawing im- plements, including fingers or hands. The splatter or "negative" design created by spraying paint or pigment around an object is also common (Figure 12B). Most of the rock art at Zuni, especially that dating from the earliest periods, consists of engraved figures. Painted images, in contrast,.appear infre- quently. Perhaps because they have suffered the effects of weathering, the earliest ones have long since disappeared. Although much of the rock art at Zuni has distinctively Zuni attributes, like modern Zuni culture it reflects the influence of the numerous prehistoric and historic groups that have lived in or passed through the Zuni-Cibola region.6 On the basis of changes in style, technique, and content, I have established the following general temporal framework for the rock art of the Zuni-Cibola region.7 The first period, prior to A.D. 400, is primarily represented by elements that are abstract in style, including masks, wavy lines, circle chains, rakes, and rec- tangular forms enclosing circles, lines, and zigzags. This rock art, which in- cludes perhaps the earliest depictions of masks in this region (Figure 3), occurs in part of a mile-long canyon west of the Zuni Pueblo in Arizona's Hardscrab- ble Wash district. The site itself plays an important role in Zuni mythology and has been linked to Zuni by archaeological studies of the area. The period from A.D. 400-1325 (Basketmaker III-Pueblo III) is often divid- 5</page><page sequence="4">M. JANE YOUNG Figure 1. Pecked lizard or anthropomorphic figure, 20 cm x 14 cm, Site 17.

Most of the figures dating from this time are solidly pecked and usually form panel groupings on cliff faces (Figure 4).8 Characteristic anthropomorphic figures are stick figures with slightly rectangular bodies, small heads, and sometimes "feathered" headdresses. The fluteplayer is a common design element, appear- ing in human, animal, and insect form. Deer, mountain sheep, and animals with long tails bent over their bodies (often identified as mountain lions) are the most frequently portrayed animals. Animal tracks, human hand- and foot- prints, and abstract designs such as spirals, concentric circles, wavy lines, and elaborate pottery and blanket designs also characterize this rock art. From around A.D. 1325 to the present, the Rio Grande style had a consid- erable impact on the rock art of the Zuni-Cibola region, although elements of the older Anasazi influence remained.9 This new artistic tradition brought with it increasingly representational human and animal forms, as well as kachina figures, masks, and shields (Figure 2). In contrast to the deep pecking of earlier periods, the predominant techniques of this period are incising, abrading, and drilling, as well as some lighter pecking. Tribal members and others continue to create rock paintings and engravings around Zuni Pueblo. The rock art produced in the past one hundred years or so reflects both a continuation of earlier styles and the impact of Western graphic art as, for example, in the use of three-quarter frontal perspective, foreshorten- ing, and shading to create the illusion of three-dimensional dynamic form (see, for example, Figure 11D). Thus, the engravings and paintings on cliff faces surrounding Zuni Pueblo represent a tradition that dates from before A.D. 400 and continues to the present day (Schaafsma and Young 1983). This rock art displays consid- erable variation in style, technique, and subject matter, ranging from the elaborate shields, masks, deer, insects, kachina dancers, and geometric designs depicted on rock outcrops near old occupation sites to the more recent spray- painted names, dates, and initials on boulders along Highway 53. My par- ticular focus here will be on those images in the rock art that appear in other artistic forms as well. Such images are often linked with the predominant theme of Zuni ritual life: the desire for increase, whether it be rain for the crops, success in the hunt, many children, or a long life. Contemporary Zuni Perceptions of Rock Art Because tribal members and archaeologists regard rock art as an important part of the Zuni cultural heritage that should be documented, the Zuni Tribal Council and Zuni Archaeology Program invited me to come to Zuni during the summers of 1979-1981 to record the rock art surrounding the pueblo. They also hoped that my work would emphasize the importance of rock art in such a way as to decrease vandalism. In carrying out this project, I not only documented the actual images but also began seeking Zuni commentary on these images and their possible meanings.10 The men and women with whom I</page><page sequence="7">IMAGES OF POWER talked, including recognized religious leaders, painters, fetish makers, and pot- ters, ranged in age from 16 to 80, had diverse occupations, and varied in their involvement in, and knowledge of, Zuni religious life. I included women in this study even though rock art production appears to be a predominantly male activity. I did so because women are the principal producers of pottery and, to a lesser extent, of fetishes, both of which use images similar to some of those appearing in the rock art. The settings for these discussions ranged from infor- mal conversations and direct observations to formal interviews. The latter were often carried on in the context of a card-sorting "experiment" aimed at eliciting categories of related images. In some cases, I was able to show Zunis slides and prints of additional rock art images as well as entire rock art panels. I would have preferred to conduct interviews at actual rock art sites so that peo- ple could view the images in their total context, but with a few exceptions, this was impossible given the difficulties involved in getting to most sites. The card-sorting experiment, devised in collaboration with John M. Roberts of the University of Pittsburgh (see Young 1982), required infor- mants11 to sort a stack of 60 four-by-six-inch cards, each bearing one rock art image or cluster of images hand-copied from a color slide, into two or more groups such that the images in each seemed to "go together." I asked each in- formant to perform this task twice, with two different stacks. One stack con- sisted of images chosen randomly from a collection of what I believed to be representations of humans, and the other consisted of animal and bird images. These are the two largest categories of image types in the rock art of this area. A computer-assisted distributional analysis of the data derived from these sortings will be the subject of a separate forthcoming article (Young and Roberts 1985). When the sorting was finished, I asked my informants to identify the in- dividual images and to label each group or to explain why they had put together those particular images. In response, they often referred to distinguishing features also associated with the graphic depiction of these same images in such other media as fetishes and pottery designs. Mountain lions, for example, were the animals with tails bent over their bodies; turkeys had clustered tail feathers; and the kachinas wore dance kilts and had feathers on their heads. Agreement on some images, especially those identified as deer, mountain sheep, and certain specific kachinas, was almost unanimous. Identifications of others were much more varied, and most informants found some images they simply couldn't identify. Even my categories of "human" and "animal" were not inviolable. Occasionally a "human" image was identified as an "animal" or vice versa, and infrequently some image in one or the other category was identified as a plant, insect, prayer stick, altar, or design. Informants tended to group animals according to "content," (e.g., there were groups of deer, mountain sheep, birds, Beast Gods, and "animals which go on pottery"). However, with certain exceptions they grouped human figures on the basis of "form" (e.g., round bodies, simple bodies, solid figures, and outlined 9</page><page sequence="8">M. JANE YOUNG figures). This may reflect the fact that with the exception of kachinas, human figures, unlike animal figures, rarely appear in any of the other Zuni art forms. Consequently, they may be less recognizable as specific beings.12 It might, therefore, be more accurate to say that while informants grouped and labeled known images by content, they grouped unknowns by form. It appears, further- more, on the basis of the chronological framework I developed, that many of the unknown images are from the older Anasazi rock art tradition, prior to A.D. 1325. The known images, on the other hand, tend to be from the more recent Rio Grande tradition characterized by more representational animal and human figures as well as kachina figures and masks. With the exception of cer- tain highly representational figures such as fluteplayers, deer, and mountain sheep, Zunis were generally unable to identify older Anasazi images. In the card-sorting experiment these images often constituted a residual category of unknowns. Of most interest was the way that the Zunis often related rock art images to various facets of their religious practice and/or to the myths describ- ing the emergence of the Zuni people into this world. Evocation of Myth Many of the rock art images in the landscape surrounding the pueblo are regarded by contemporary Zunis as meaningful "signs from the past" that were made by "the ancestors." For example, one man told me that many Zunis believe the images were drawn on the rocks during the time when the rocks were still soft-back in the time of the beginning, before the earth was hardened. He described the earth at that time as awitelin kapin, meaning "raw earth."13 Certain images-generally among the more ambiguous in design and dating from the earliest time periods-stimulated the narration of excerpts of Zuni myths, and tales about creatures or events called to mind by these images.14 Especially frequent were those stories about the mythic period when animals and people did not look or act the way they do now. As one informant described it, "all the animals and bugs used to speak way back then." These narratives or narrative segments were generally not prefaced by any introduc- tion such as "I will explain it this way," or "it means this." Rather, they were simply begun as a direct response to particular images. Thus, in a sense, these graven images were transformed into narrative events; products were transformed into process. In his book The Art of the Festival, Robert Smith defines "metonyms of nar- rative" as "portions of the narrative which stand for the whole story" (1975:98), then expands this notion to include visual images when they have the same power to symbolize and recall the entire story. So, for example, when human figures in a festival procession have been "captured by the nar- rative . . . it is impossible from that moment on to see them except as repre- sentatives of the story. . . . Once a figure becomes 'captured' by a narrative, it stands for it and sums it up" (1975:98). Smith suggests that in situations like this, the term "story" is more appropriate than the term "narrative" because 10</page><page sequence="9">IMAGES OF POWER it implies "a narrative which is structured affectively" (1975:98). Thus, Zuni rock art images serve as metonyms of narrative because they have the power to evoke parts of tales and myths and, furthermore, they do so in an affective manner.15 The rock art images not only evoke these stories about "the time of the beginning" but also the emotions associated with them. The older Zunis among my informants were those who most frequently re- ferred to certain images as linked with the "time of the beginning," perhaps because they and people of their generation know most about the mythical world and most readily find its presence in such visual imagery. Younger Zunis, especially when they did not know something themselves, indicated that it was the more elderly members of the tribe who knew most about myths, tales, and the meanings of things in general; it is the "old people who are the experts" about such matters. For instance, one man in his late 50s said that he only knew a few of the rock art images and did not recognize the others but added, "they used to tell us that a long time ago they were made to represent clans and stuff like that-but, most of them I couldn't say that I know. I'm not that old." Zunis relate the imagery of other material forms to the time of "the ancestors" as well. In her study of Zuni fetishes, Kirk suggests that the Zunis have a real need to link themselves and their more important fetishes with the time of the myth (1943:154-155). While this may be a means for Zunis to validate their beliefs and ritual practices, it also reveals much about the Zuni at- titude toward time. Although a myth may be introduced as having occurred a "long time ago" or "in the beginning," the events described are not regarded as over and done with, situated at a single point in a linear flow of time. Rather, they are ever-present, informing the here and now.16 Much as the past coexists with the present when evoked by rock art images, so too as Smith suggests more generally, do "metonyms of narrative" func- tion "to convert diachrony into synchrony." Consequently, "there is a tremendous compression of both emotion and concepts in the metonym" (1975:99). It is, I believe, this compression of emotion that accounts for the af- fect and, hence, the power of these images. Indeed, such rock art images fit Robert P. Armstrong's description of "affecting presences": works with "indwelling" power "which own some kind of ability-of efficacy of affect" (1981:14, 15). Affecting objects, according to Armstrong, must be regarded in a dynamic way, as "both 'things' and 'events' " (1981:27). Such objects are those in any culture that are accepted by its participants "as being purposefully concerned with potency, emotions, values, and states of being or experience- all, in a clear sense, powers" (1971:4). For the Zunis the power of certain visual images, their affecting presence, lies in their ability to evoke stories of the myth time and consequently to make the past coexistent with the present. One such group of images consisted of varieties of "lizard men," which are lizard-like, anthropomorphic figures prevalent in the rock art of the Zuni- Cibola region (Figures 1 and 8A). Several Zunis identified these figures as "the way the Zunis looked at the time of the beginning" or "in the fourth under- 11</page><page sequence="10">M. JANE YOUNG world," often adding "when we still had tails." A few people even launched into telling the part of their origin myth in which these creatures, "moss peo- ple," are described as having tails and webbed hands and feet.17 Matilda Stevenson reports a similar response by her Zuni guide to one such figure she found and photographed near Zuni in 1879 (1904:42, Plate VII). As Bunzel cautions in the preface to her collection of Zuni origin myths, "there is no single origin myth but a long series of separate myths" (1932:547). Nor, she adds, is there a single template for all the others because, though "the main outlines of the origin myths are known to all, and great delight is found in recounting them . . . no mind in Zuni encompasses all knowledge" (1932:548). Thus, she suggests, just as the origin myths told by different narrators will vary, so also will those collected by different eth- nographers. Various scholars have now published a number of versions of "the Zuni origin myth" which, in their differences, support this claim by Bunzel. The parts of this myth that follow are conflated from origin myths recorded by Bunzel (1932:547-609), Cushing (1896:321-447), Parsons (1923:135-162), M. Stevenson (1904:20-61), and D. Tedlock(1972:225-298). I also incor- porate portions that I recorded from several Zuni informants, told in my words and, in some places, including my own extended commentary. I make no at- tempt to relate the entire myth, but have instead included only those parts necessary to my discussion of narrative-evoking images and, in some cases, the meaning and functions of those and other images within the Zuni cultural con- text. According to most versions of the Zuni origin myth, the people did not behave in a properly "human" manner at the time of the beginning but did the reverse of what they should have done. They were dirty beings, somewhat similar in appearance to the salamander (D. Tedlock 1975:268-269), who did not worship their father the sun and in other ways did not behave correctly. They were not "finished," "ripe," or "human" beings but rather "raw" or "non-human" beings (Cushing 1883:9-11; D. Tedlock 1975:264-270; 1979: 499-508; Young 1978).18 In the underworld there was neither linear time nor geographic location, for the people did not yet have a "center." Taking pity on these poor creatures and also wanting their prayer offerings, the Sun Father sent his sons, the Twin War Gods, to lead the people to the surface of the earth. When the people reached this surface after having traveled through the four underworlds, they were dazzled by the light of the sun and were made human by the Twins. They were washed, their tails were cut off, their webbed digits were separated, and the testicles were removed from the tops of their heads. They were also hardened or finished in the same fire with which the Twins had hardened the soft surface of the earth. Thus, the myth describes the existence of the Zuni people in the underworld as a period of in- version that ended when they reached the surface of the earth. As portrayed in rock art, these lizard-like figures, part reptile, part human, are quite ambiguous, perhaps intentionally so. Ambiguity is certainly charac- teristic of Zuni verbal art, which abounds with word play and metaphor 12</page><page sequence="11">IMAGES OF POWER (Bunzel 1932:617-620; Young 1978). It is not surprising, therefore, to find similar ambiguity in Zuni visual art as well. In fact, as I elaborate below, this ability to operate at different levels of meaning is partially responsible for the power of such images. In any case, younger Zunis, especially those involved in pottery making, generally tended to see these images as lizards, frogs, and toads rather than as anthropomorphic figures, grouping them with other similar images as "things which go on pottery." Such animals are considered to be "raw beings" with special powers whose origins are also described in the Zuni emergence myth. After the people had emerged from the underworlds and were wandering the earth looking for the middle place, a brother and sister committed incest near the place that later became Kachina Village (which, according to Zuni belief, is where their dead go and where they become kachinas who have the power to send rain). As a result of their trans- gression, the brother and sister were transformed into beings of hideous ap- pearance. The brother and nine of the offspring of this incestuous union became the Koyemshi who, in Zuni ritual, are represented as grotesque clowns, the "mudheads" (Bahr 1977:329; Bunzel 1932:521; Gushing 1882:4-5; Fewkes 1891:22-24; Parsons 1917:229-237). Furthermore, the sister was so outraged that she created a river dividing a mountain to separate herself from her brother (Cushing 1896:400). One Zuni man described the subsequent events as follows: As the people were searching for the center place, they had to cross a river near the Kachina Village. Although the mothers held tightly to their children, they turned into water beings in their mothers' arms-and, many of the mothers dropped their children into the water. Those who were dropped swam to Kachina Village and joined the kachinas there. These animals are water beings both in a literal and a metaphoric sense. Not only are they creatures who live in or near the water, but their images are used in several ritual activities aimed at bringing water to Zuni in the form of rain. Images of frogs, toads, and tadpoles are painted on pottery water jars so that they will fill with water. These images are used in kiva murals and on the backs of kachina masks to ensure that there will be rain for the crops (Harlow 1977:87-89; M. Stevenson 1904: Plate III, Plate XXXVI)-examples of what Ruth Bunzel has called "compulsive magic" (1929:23-24, 69-71; 1932: 491-493). The animals depicted by these images and, through them, the im- ages themselves, derive their power from their association with certain "vital" aspects of the physical world such as water and rain. Because toads live near the water, and an image of a toad can "represent" it, the production of this image is an important part of those ritual activities aimed at encouraging rainfall. This associational power is not, however, limited to images. Living turtles, for example, are carried in the hands of some of the kachina impersonators as they perform the summer rain dances. With the emergence of the ancestors from the underworlds and the begin- ning of their journey in search of the middle place, the origin myth takes on a 13</page><page sequence="12">M. JANE YOUNG more "historical" character involving notions of linear time (though clearly still mythic)19 and travels to places the Zunis identify with actual geographic locations. For instance, they say that a river in Arizona is the site of the act of incest that created the Koyemshi, and they identify a nearby lake as the loca- tion of Kachina Village. Several Zunis told me that the actual place of the ancestors' emergence from the underworlds to the surface of this earth was located "somewhere in the Grand Canyon" and that later in those travels, the second set of Twin War Gods, often called the diminutive war gods, were created and the clans were given their names at Hantlipinkia, a place in Arizona near the reservation (M. Stevenson 1904:34-35, 40; Young, 1979-1981). In fact, several Zunis claimed that the images on one very large and densely covered panel of rock art at this site were those clan symbols, although identifications of the specific images were not usually offered. Describing that mythic event, Stevenson writes, "Each name was chosen from some object seen at the time, and the totem of each clan was cut on the rocky walls; many of them are to be seen at the present time" (M. Stevenson 1904: 40). Such places have, in some instances, even been incorporated into Zuni rituals. For example, Kachina Village in Arizona is the destination of an im- portant pilgrimage undertaken every four years. Some Zunis regard their ability to identify points named in the myth with actual geographical locations as a validation of the myth. One man expressed this in the following way: Our so-called legends and stories are all based on actual facts. The migration happened as it is told in the stories. White men don't understand that, but Cushing found the ruins where the people had stopped, just where the Zunis said they were in their so-called legends. They're fact. [Chamberlain 1978] Yet the actual geographic location of mythic places may not be as important as their location within the time and space of the myth. For instance, although most tribal members are familiar with the name "Hantlipinkia" and consider it to be a shrine area that should be visited by certain religious groups, many do not know its precise location. On one occasion when I visited the site with an elderly religious leader he commented, somewhat noncommitally, "maybe this is where I should have been bringing those prayer sticks." Not all events within the myth are said to have happened at places some distance from Zuni. In and about the pueblo too, a number of places with distinctive physical features are often identified as the locations of various mythic events. For instance, I have heard some Zunis describe certain lopsided boulders just east of the village as marking the path of Salt Old Woman when the people desecrated her and she fled in anger. They associate the mesa called Corn Mountain with the time of the flood, partly because they attribute the banding of the sandstone to the different water levels as the water receded. They also say that the two stone pillars at its base represent the children who were sacrificed to the Horned Water Serpent so that the waters would dry up. 14</page><page sequence="13">IMAGES OF POWER Furthermore, they describe certain oddly shaped rocks as the monsters that were solidified into rock in the fire the Twin War Gods used to harden the surface of the earth after the emergence. All of these features of the present-day landscape evoke and are identified with events that took place at the "time of the beginning." Hence, like rock art images, these features of the landscape can also serve as metonyms of narrative: "Mountains, springs, trees, anything in the landscape may serve as such once it has been identified with a narrative. This fact explains the difference in meaningfulness of a landscape to people who live in an area and to those who are only passing through" (Smith 1975:98). A similar linking of sacred locations and other features to mytholog- ical events has been described by Hudson and Lee in a paper that focuses on the function and symbolism of Chumash rock art. The authors state: Such locations were not only given placenames, but many quite probably also received some form of visual identity-a prominent symbol or symbols . . . linked to specific myths and First People, and recognized by the community. Such sites must clearly have served to connect the greater community with its sacred past. Their specific location within the community served as a "story display" of their past and present within the total realm of the universe. [1981:25] The relationship between visual forms and traditional narratives is not one- sided, however. Narratives themselves can evoke the image of a visual form. For example, the mention of a place name in reciting a portion of the Zuni origin myth can evoke an image of the place named, both as an important point in the ancestors' quest for the center and also as a known place in the physical world. Kachina Village, the home of the masked gods, not only has mythic existence in the past but physical existence in the present at the specific lake in Arizona to which the Zunis make a pilgrimage every four years. Thus, once again, past and present coexist; the time of the myth is one with everyday existence. In a discussion of narrative presuppositions in the performance of Eastern Pomo myth, Sally McLendon suggests similarly that the reference to "real geographical areas functions to call forth an image of the area itself," ad- ding that "the assertion of locational and directional detail involves the presup- position that the myths are true" (1977:161, 162). At Zuni, such areas often have well-recognized markers, for example, the skewed boulders identifying the path of Salt Old Woman. In other instances no such marker, nor even a place name, exists to specify or recall the purported site of an event. Never- theless, the location of the site is "known" with no less certainty. In a discus- sion of the conflict the Twin War Gods had with a monstrous snake that whipped them with its tail, one old man told me, "It happened over there, just beyond the place where the elementary school is now." Certainly, this ability to locate an episode from a myth, despite the lack of an obvious physical marker, serves to validate the myth. Here, too, McLendon's work is relevant. She describes driving around with an Eastern Pomo myth teller who pointed out to her the specific locations where episodes in a myth took place, "despite 15</page><page sequence="14">M. JANE YOUNG the fact that none of the significant landmarks remained!" (1977:163). Thus, the merging of present with past at Zuni is a validation both of everyday ex- perience and of the myths, linked in some instances to visual features and in others to verbal formulae. The origin myth is "centered" in Zuni ritual both spatially and temporally. The myth itself is the story of their search for the "center," the middle place. Spiral images in the rock art, especially the more elaborate ones (Figure 4), have been described to me as visual representations of this search. Further- more, the myth is recited in a ritual context at the "center" of the Zuni year: the winter solstice. In this instance, the Zuni do not use the word "center" to mean middle, but rather, in a more spiritual sense, to mean a beginning (Bunzel 1932:534; Young 1978). The winter solstice marks the beginning of the Zuni year, the time when the sun appears to "stand still" for four days and then "turns around" in its journey and starts back along the horizon.20 The number four is both sacred and ubiquitous in Zuni ritual and mythol- ogy.21 The people traveled through four underworlds and then spent four years (or, in some versions, four days) searching for the center. And, as just noted, Zunis perceive the sun as "standing still" at the solstices for four days rather than three or five. One informant even suggested that handprints in the rock art represented the forecasting of some event four days hence, and several handprints together referred to a predicated event four times that number of days hence. Such an interpretation ignores the thumb and counts only the four fingers. In Zuni ritual practice, too, this number is significant. For instance, Zunis scatter sacred corn meal in the direction of the four solstice points, that is, the four points on the horizon approximating the semi-cardinal directions of northwest, southwest, southeast, and northeast (their usual ritual order) where the winter and summer solstice suns rise and set and appear to "stand still."22 According to the origin myth, the "center" was finally found when the water skate, given magical powers of extension by the Sun Father, stretched out his four legs to those same four solstice points. The place where his heart and navel then rested marked the center, the heart, and navel of the Earth Mother. This, according to the myth, is the place where the present-day Zuni was built (Bunzel 1932:601-602; Cushing 1896:428-429; M. Stevenson 1904:46; D. Tedlock 1972:278-280; Young 1979-1981). Stretched thus, limbs extending to the solstice points, the water skate appears to form a figure X (Figure 5), with his body as the center. Any X, therefore, can be seen to symbolize this. One informant saw a representation of the story of the water skate finding the middle place in an image of a mask with feathers across the top (Figure 6), perhaps by ignoring most of the image and focusing on the X made by the lines representing the long sides of the outermost feathers. Like the number four, the number six is ever-present in Zuni ritual. Its origins lie in the Zuni recognition of the three-dimensional nature of the world in which they live. Thus, the zenith and nadir are added to the four solstice points located on the horizon which, in a sense, form the seemingly planar sur- 16</page><page sequence="15">IMAGES OF POWER Summer Solstice Sunrise -- NE SE -- Winter Solstice Sunrise Summer Solstice Sunset -- NW SW - Winter Solstice Sunset Figure 5. Schematic drawing of circle of earth's horizon with solstice rise and set points marked (the inner circle and dotted lines could repre- sent the heart and legs of the water strider described in part of the Zuni origin myth). face of the earth. There are, for instance, six sacred kivas, each associated with one of these directions. Associated, in turn, with the kivas are the six Shalako kachinas (major figures in the "coming of the gods" ceremony which occurs prior to the winter solstice), accompanied by six pairs of Salimobia ("warrior" kachinas who accompany the Shalako kachinas). When these kachinas come to the pueblo at the time of the Shalako ceremony, they dedicate the six houses (called Shalako houses) that have been built or remodeled in the past year. There are rain priests of the six directions "who take the form of clouds, rainstorms, fog and dew when they leave their homes" (D. Tedlock 1979: 499), six bow priests who make lightning and thunder (M. Stevenson Figure 6. Incised and abraded mask, 25 cm x 35 cm, Site 16. Drawing from slide by Murray Callahan. 17</page><page sequence="16">M. JANE YOUNG 1904:22; D. Tedlock 1979:499), and six different varieties of "water bringing birds" (M. Stevenson 1915:89; D. Tedlock 1979:499-500). Also associated with each direction and symbolizing it is a color. Animals, too, are drawn into this network of symbolic relations. According to Zuni mythology, the world is guarded by six Beast Gods, wemawe. Each wemawe is positioned at one of the four solstice points as well as above and below, and is colored accordingly. These are the yellow mountain lion of the northwest, the blue bear of the southwest, the red badger of the southeast, the white wolf of the northeast, the speckled or all-colored eagle of the zenith, and the black mole of the nadir. Sometimes it is Knife-Wing, the mythic being with wings and tail of knives, rather than eagle who is associated with the zenith (Bunzel 1932:784; D. Tedlock 1979:500). As described earlier, Zunis believe that when their ancestors emerged from the four underworlds onto the surface of this world, they were transformed from the "raw" beings they had been into "made," "finished," or "ripe" beings. According to Zuni belief, moreover, all inhabitants of the world vary along this rawness-completeness continuum and, furthermore, one's power is directly correlated with one's degree of "rawness." Raw beings, such as the kachinas, have more power than others, and all beings are ranged along a hierarchy with respect to rawness and power. Rawness, here, seems to imply closeness to the world of the myth and the events that transpired then, and it is those beings for whom this rawness is an attribute who appear to have the ability to effect change in the physical world. The "moss people" were infused with a particular kind of power that was lost when humans became "finished beings." Since then, humans, the most "finished" of all creatures, have also been the least powerful, located at the very bottom of the taxonomy (Cushing 1883:9; Young 1979-1981). Having little power themselves, humans have had to rely on more powerful raw beings to act as mediators between themselves and the most powerful beings, especially the kachinas, and to convey to the latter their prayers for rain.23 Such mediation is often effected by means of visual representations of the mediators in a variety of forms including masks, fetishes, images on pottery, and, perhaps, rock art as well (e.g., the previously mentioned uses of images of various water creatures). Another such group of powerful (raw) mediating begins often called upon to carry the spirit of Zuni prayers to the kachinas are the aforementioned Beast Gods of the six directions. They are located at the solstice points, and Zunis believe them to have the power to send rain- and snow-bearing winds from these directions. Images of the Beast Gods are painted on the walls and altars of the kivas and medicine society rooms. Generally, all six beings are painted, for, as one Zuni man said, "It would not be right to leave any one out." They are an important component of the ceremonies that take place in these rooms, and Zunis refer to them in the words of their prayers and in the act of scattering sacred corn meal to the six directions. In sorting the stack of "animal" cards, many of my Zuni informants found images they identified as the various Beast Gods, often describing their asso- 18</page><page sequence="17">IMAGES OF POWER ciations with specific colors and directions. Owing, perhaps, to their close association with the directions, in more than one instance a description of the Beast Gods occasioned the telling of the story of the Water Skate who, by stretching his legs to the solstice points, helps the people find the center. Because all six Beast Gods go together in many other contexts, some Zunis were perplexed if they could not find images of all of them while sorting the cards; others seemed to make a point of finding them, going back over the cards until they found something "close enough." The six Beast Gods, however, rarely appear together in rock art. Only those identified as the mountain lion (Figure 7A), Knife-Wing or eagle (Figure 7B, 7C), and the bear track (Figure 13A) commonly occur, and even these three rarely appear together on the same rock face. This also appears to be true with respect to Beast God fetishes, perhaps for the same reason. Because the Beast Gods are all animals of prey, Zunis believe that their fetishes have great power in bringing success in the hunt (Cushing 1883:11-12), and nearly everyone at Zuni has a fetish of one or another of these beings.24 Since the power of these fetishes is derived by analogy from the power their animal counterparts have in the "natural" world, each fetish has greatest power with respect to the par- ticular game animals that are its prey. Thus, a hunter usually takes with him only the fetish that has the most power over the game he wishes to hunt (Cushing 1883:21-24; D. Tedlock 1979:500-501). In the rock art too, images of a Beast God and the animal over which it has power, such as the mountain lion and the deer (Young 1982, Figure 48), or the eagle (or Knife-Wing) and rabbit (Young 1982, Figure 49), are frequently found near one another on the same rock face. Of related interest, the division between game animals (deer and mountain sheep) and prey animals (Beast Gods or wemawe) appears to have been an important conceptual distinction in the card-sorting process for at least some Zunis.25 Although other animals are the subject of fetishes and their images were also often grouped together, only the Beast Gods evoked stories and descriptions, perhaps because of their significant role in Zuni mythology and ceremonialism. In the myth, the Beast Gods were among those animals of prey that the Twin War Gods changed into stone. Cushing, describing the origin of animal fetishes, states it thus: ... .it happens that we find, here and there throughout the world, their forms, sometimes large like the beings themselves, sometimes shriveled and distorted. And we often see among the rocks the forms of many beings that live no longer, which shows us that all was different in the "days of the new." [Cushing 1883:14-15] Many informants associated the Beast Gods with a group of images labeled "snakes," including Kolowisi, the plumed or horned water serpent, an impor- tant figure in Zuni mythology, fetishes of which, like those of the Beast Gods, are among the most powerful. In much of Zuni ceremonialism, prayers are of- fered not only to the Beast Gods of the six directions but also to the snakes 19</page><page sequence="18">M. JANE YOUNG Figure 7.

Tedlock 1979:500). According to Stevenson, some of the medicine men who came to this world from the fourth underworld were converted into the six Beast Gods, and "the others were converted into rattlesnakes and ants to preside with wisdom over the earth" (M. Stevenson 1904:49). A picture in Stevenson's report of a mural in the meeting place of the Wood Society shows, in addition to all six Beast Gods, six snakes colored in the hues associated with the six directions (1904: 453, Plate CVIII). There is also a connection between Kolowisi and the rat- tlesnake. In rock art, pottery, and fetishes, images of Kolowisi (distinguishable by the horn and/or feathers on the head of its serpentine body) often depict as well the rattle of the rattlesnake at the tip of its tail (Bunzel 1929:93, Figure 2; M. Stevenson 1904:94, Plate XIII; Young 1979-1981). At one pictograph site, in addition to images of six Shalako kachinas and the Council of the Gods, there are also six painted Kolowisi, again one in each of the colors associated with the six directions.26 Thus, like the Beast Gods, the Kolowisi are drawn 20</page><page sequence="19">IMAGES OF POWER into a complex system of symbolic relations associating them with each other as well as with particular colors, directions, and segments of society. It is this network of symbolic associations, involving both verbal formulae and visual forms, that makes the physical environment as a whole, and the elements within it, meaningful to the Zunis.27 Citing an event from Zuni mythology, one informant identified Kolowisi in the following manner: . . .the great water serpent which caused the flood in ancient times, forcing the people to flee to the top of Corn Mountain. The children of the high priest saved the people by going into the water. The serpent was satisfied and the waters went away, leaving marks on the sides of the mesa. Two stone pillars came into being where the children went into the water. One is a woman and the other is a man. They are used in the fertility rites of the Zunis.28 Others provided similar descriptions, also acknowledging Kolowisi as the guardian of spring areas. Once again, an image, long ago fixed in stone, had the power to "evoke" a story, in which information is passed on about that image and its relationship to the Zuni world. For the images I labeled "anthropomorphs," many of which were grouped as "unknowns," there was less general agreement on identifications, and few such images evoked stories or descriptions (Young 1982: Young and Roberts 1985). One major exception was the group of images labeled "kachinas" (see e.g., Figures 8B, 8C, 8D). The identification of individual kachinas was generally agreed upon, but such images tended to evoke descriptions of the particular ceremonies in which they take part, rather than stories of the "time of the beginning." Other images that also evoked descriptions of rituals were those labeled as "humpbacked fluteplayers" (Figure 9, Figure 4-far right) and "clowns" (Figure 8F).29 Although geometric designs were not a category in the card-sorting proce- dure, photographs of them, as well as visits to actual sites where they were depicted, elicited comments that linked these figures to "the time of the beginning." Such comments did not generally involve specific identifications; instead, the most elaborate geometric designs (e.g., the design to the right of the panel in Figure 4) were frequently described as having been "done by our ancestors" and as conveying "some sort of message which we no longer understand." One may say, in fact, that these images, too, are metonymic but in a broader sense than was true of the rock art images and other landscape features discussed earlier. Zunis describe them not only as the creations of "the ancestors" but as images bearing some special, if undecipherable, message from them to the contemporary Zuni people; they are "signs from the ancestors." Rather than recalling any specific event of the myth, these images represent or recall the time of the myth in its entirety. These are the kinds of images that were most often referred to as "hieroglyphs," both by the Zunis and by early ethnographers (Harrington n.d.30; Hodge and Cushing n.d.; McNitt 1964:120-142; Young 1979-1981).31 Many Zunis regard such images 21</page><page sequence="20">M.

They see these mysterious signs, carved by their ancestors but now unintelligible, as impor- tant messages demonstrating the direct involvement of the ancestors in the present day, even if that involvement cannot be precisely articulated. One might contrast this view with that of Westerners who see Stonehenge in 22</page><page sequence="21">IMAGES OF POWER C Figure 9. Fluteplayers. All pecked and from Site 17.

England as the work of ancestors, mysterious and powerful, but having no particular meaning for the present day. Power of Image and Place The previous discussion has centered on certain rock art images and environ- mental features that were evocative of, or perceived as formed in, the time of the myth. I now wish to explore the related issues of why rock art images are produced, and the function of certain rock art sites at Zuni in the present day 23</page><page sequence="22">M. JANE YOUNG or the recent past. Underlying both concerns is the concept of power, whether it be the power evoked by certain images that recall the "time of the begin- ning" or the power associated with the depiction of certain images as a means to a desired end. Certain categories of "powerful" rock art images, such as Beast Gods and water creatures, appear in other graphic forms at Zuni as well. Perhaps this is because the Zunis would most naturally surround themselves with precisely those images regarded as potentially powerful and capable of bringing benefits to them, whatever the artistic mode. The use of such imagery may be an in- stance of what Bunzel has called "compulsive magic" (1932:489-492), that is, the attempt to attain certain desired events or outcomes by their ritual depic- tion, either in the form of graphic illustrations or by means of their dramatic enactment. Previously mentioned examples include painting images of water- related creatures on bowls so that they would be filled with water (Bunzel 1929:23-24, 69-71) and carrying the fetish of a Beast God while hunting its natural prey (Cushing 1883:11-12). Likewise, Bunzel reports that Zuni pot- ters often painted images of deer enclosed in a "house" on their pottery so that their husbands would have good luck in hunting (1929:94-95). It is quite possible that some rock art images were produced for similar reasons. For instance, I was told that images identified as "insects" had been carved on the rocks so they would either make Zunis invisible to the enemy in battle (as protective coloring and shape render such insects "invisible" to their predators) or so these insects would sting the enemy. Similarly, images of game animals, especially the many carved images of mountain sheep struck with spears and deer with arrows projecting from their bodies (Figure 10), may have been made in the hopes of assuring good luck in the hunt. Although most of the rather numerous depictions of such animals in rock art of the Zuni- Cibola region are not so explicitly related to hunting, many of them may, in fact, have been produced for this reason (Young 1982, Figure 55). In any case, whatever the original motive for their production, such images, once made, might very well have been used in ritual activities aimed at ensuring the success of the hunt. For example, in her major work on Zuni published at the turn of the century, Stevenson states that rock art images of game animals, especially deer, were sometimes shot with arrows before the men set out to hunt (M. Stevenson 1904:439). Some evidence suggests that suitable rock art images may still be used in this way, at least on a limited scale, although the weapons are now guns rather than arrows, spears, or atlatls. Whether shooting at rock art images is motivated by a belief in the efficacy of ritual activity to ensure a successful hunt or by a simple desire for target practice, the bullet holes and disfigured images are mute testimony to the fact that it is done. When I initially undertook the project of recording rock art at Zuni, I assumed that bullet holes, like spray-painted, chalked, and carved graffiti, were examples of vandalism. Now I have come to believe that, at least in some cases, the bullet holes are the visible remains of the modern version of the sort of ritual activity described by Stevenson, rather than being the result of vandal- ism. The choice of targets, generally game animals such as mountain sheep and 24</page><page sequence="23">IMAGES OF POWER Figure 10. Incised and gouged deer with arrows, 50 cm x 35 cm, Site 2. Photo by Nancy L. Bartman, 1979. deer, would seem to support such a conclusion (Figure 10; Young 1982, Figure 56). Reexamination of two panels of painted masks and animal figures at a site called the Village of the Great Kivas on the Zuni reservation has shown that while none of the other kachina masks had been used as targets, some masks and images of game animals had been disfigured by bullet holes.32 In Figure 15 the deer figure to the far right is riddled with bullet holes, as are the bear (also identified as coyote) and buffalo masks.33 The only image marked by bullet holes in the second panel of masks (Figure 11) is the deer (this is most obvious in Figure 17). Overall, only the masks and figures of the buffalo, bear, and deer have been damaged in this way. It would appear, then, that some Zunis, at least, are less concerned with the preservation of these images as "art" than with their use towards more practical ends. This is quite in keep- 25</page><page sequence="24">M. JANE YOUNG Figure 11. Panel of painted masks and figures, 1.5 m x 8 m, Site 1. Photo by M. Jane Young, 1980. Images from left to right are: (A) Atoshle-Male Scare Kachina; (B) Kumance-Comanche; (C) Hehe'a; (D) Shalako; (E) Suyuki-Female Scare Kachina; (F) Wo'latana; (G) Wilatsukwe-Apache; (H) Wa:kashi-Cow, or Anshe-Bear; (I) Kumance-Comanche. ing with the numerous accounts in the ethnographic literature describing the purposeful "destruction" by Zunis of pottery, baskets, sand paintings, and kiva murals in rites of cleansing, renewal, and purification (Bunzel 1932:506; M. Stevenson 1904:97, 141, 146, 564; Young 1979-1981). While an outsider might consider the destruction of such material culture items to be a deplorable loss to the scientific community which seeks to preserve and study such things, the Zunis place a high value on "newness" and do not necessarily value their "old things" as others do.34 Barbara Tedlock points out this emphasis on change and newness in her description of kachina dance songs, many of which are made new for every dance. Although these songs are tape-recorded by many Zunis, they are not "preserved" for posterity but taped over and re- placed by "newer" songs when they have become "old" (1973:90-92; Young 1979-1981). This attitude may change with increased emphasis on the preser- vation of the "old ways" by many tribal agencies and individuals, but for the present it certainly remains. At the same time, it should be clear from the previous section that many Zunis do value "old" rock art because of its presumed great antiquity, related to their perception of it as having been made by "the ancestors." This is a somewhat different situation from that of the rain dance songs created last week or last year or even pots made 50 to 100 years ago. Nor are all songs created for particular rain dances and then forgotten. For example, Barbara 26</page><page sequence="25">IMAGES OF POWER Tedlock distinguishes between songs that should be new each time and those most sacred prayers and ritual activities that should never be changed but must be learned word for word and carried out in the same manner from year to year (1973:92). Finally, though some Zunis may shoot at rock art images, others are dis- turbed by this practice, stating that it is "a shame" and attributing it to "young kids who don't know any better." Figure 15 illustrates this point. Whatever the reason for the shooting of the bear mask (third mask from the left), it is apparent that since the time of the shooting someone has tried to repair the damage that was created. The lines of the mouth have been re- painted over the bullet holes. Although I have made use of Bunzel's term "compulsive magic," I dislike the sense of causality and legerdemain it seems to imply. The relationship be- tween an action and the desired result is not conceived by Zunis as causal in the Western scientific sense of the term. As already noted, Zunis do not believe themselves to be so endowed with power that they themselves can make things happen. Instead, they consider themselves to be relatively weak beings who must consequently depend on the aid of more powerful mediators to gain their desired ends. In return for this help, Zunis make appropriate offerings both to these mediators and those even more powerful beings to whom such mediators convey their prayers. Zuni religious belief is thus based, not on a no- tion of the ability of humans to cause things to happen, but on one of reciprocity between humans and other more powerful beings who do have this ability to effect change in the physical world. This is particularly evident in the texts of ritual prayers, which often describe in great detail all of the ritual ac- tivities carried out during the year and conclude with a "request" section, which implies that because the people have done their part, the higher powers should reciprocate in kind and grant their request (Bunzel 1932:615-620; Young 1978). Conversely, activities intended to ensure the success of the hunt, such as the painting of a deer enclosed in his "house" on a piece of pot- tery or the carving on rocks of deer with arrows through their bodies, are not simply magical acts, believed to be sufficient to produce the desired outcome. Rather, such depictions are only one part of the ritual activity believed necessary to achieve the desired end, albeit the most explicitly communicative of what is being asked for. To be effective, such depictions must be accom- panied by the appropriate prayers and offerings, and the entire ritual must be carried out by one who has a "good heart" (Bunzel 1932:492, 505-506, 522; Parsons 1917:238-241; M. Stevenson 1904:166, 252). When such prayers are not answered-if, for example, the dry spell continues despite the rain dances-this is attributed to the involvement in the ceremony of someone who has a "bad heart" (M. Stevenson 1904:166). Thus, the core of Zuni religion may be said to be a belief, not in magic, but in the efficacy of reciprocal rela- tions, the belief that if ritual activities are carried out in the proper manner, with a "good heart," the desired result will be obtained. The central issue here, then, is the power of ritual activity and related visual imagery, but only as they exist within this framework of reciprocity. 27</page><page sequence="26">M. JANE YOUNG The aim or request of most such activity is traditionally expressed in terms of a number of related goals, such as rain for the crops, success in the hunt, many children, and a long life. These, however, are often metaphors for the broader goals of increase and prosperity in general or for the satisfaction of a variety of specific needs relating to particular situations. The metaphoric, rather than directly literal, nature of such requests is underlined by the interest- ing adaptation to modern circumstances reported by Tedlock (1973:69-70). Traditionally, summer rain dancers have carried corn kernels and seeds of im- portant crops in their belts as the "heart" of their request (Bunzel 1932: 873-874). As the economy of Zuni has shifted from a reliance on farming to a heavy dependence on the sale of jewelry and pottery, many dancers now carry a lump of turquoise instead of the seeds in their belts. Although the song text is couched in terms of the traditional request for rain, it is clear that rain is used here as a metaphor for prosperity in general and the increased sales of jewelry in particular. Another example of such metaphoric activity is the ritual smoking during the ceremonies in kivas and medicine society rooms in which one sends smoke to the six directions so that the gods of those regions may, in return, send their "smoke" in the form of clouds, and hence, rain. In the text of the prayer, the same word, cipololon, is used to denote "smoke," "mist," and "rain," a sort of intentional ambiguity that is characteristic of Zuni verbal art (Bunzel 1932: 619; Young 1978). If rock art images, such as those mentioned earlier (water beings which can bring rain, insects which can render one invisible or sting the enemy, and game animals and their predators), may be regarded as powerful or capable of invoking power, then so too is the place where they are found. In fact, many early anthropologists and archaeologists suggested that rock art images were often used to mark shrine areas (Fewkes 1891:9-10; M. Stevenson 1904:40, 43, 294). But what exactly is a shrine area? Can a clustering of rock art images be sacred in itself? Can it make the place where it is found powerful? It may be impossible to separate in this manner the power of the place and the power of the images found there or to distinguish one or the other as being prior or prime. This is because rock art characteristically brings together both the power of place and the power of imagery, juxtaposing the natural world with the human creative world. Nevertheless, a discussion of certain places where rock art occurs in the Zuni-Cibola region will be useful at this point. Rock art is found beyond the confines of the pueblo proper, beyond the cen- tral dwelling place, and, hence, in potentially "dangerous" areas less con- trolled by the people, areas in which raw, powerful beings dwell. Pictograph and petroglyph sites include cliff walls and caves, places where game animals and prey animals roam, and places where Zunis say even the powerful kachinas sometimes assume animal form and walk about (M. Stevenson 1898:38). Perhaps inaccessibility itself may be a power-producing attribute of such sites. Rock art sites are often located near sacred shrine areas such as mesa tops and spring areas where prayer sticks are deposited during the yearly round of ritual 28</page><page sequence="27">IMAGES OF POWER activities. In his recitation of all the ceremonial duties he has performed that year to ensure rain for the crops, Sayatasha (the Long Horn Kachina) mentions the names of 29 spring areas where he left prayer sticks; several of these places are rock art sites (Bunzel 1932:717; Young 1978). One such spring-shrine area is the previously mentioned Hantlipinkia. The name of another of these spring areas, Atsinakwi, translates as "the place of the writing." Zunis told me that "writing," in this case, referred specifically to the rock art images located there (Bunzel 1932:717; M. Stevenson 1904:85, 87; Young 1979-1981). As noted earlier, features in the landscape around the pueblo are perceived as powerful because of their relationship to mythical events and beings. In this situation, too, one might expect that the location of powerful rock art images at or near such areas would increase the power-invoking potential of both. Certainly rock art occurs at areas such as Hantlipinkia where, although the rock art is not itself responsible for the sacredness of the place, it may add to this sacredness, having supposedly been created by the ancestors. Still, Hant- lipinkia derives its sacredness first and foremost from the metonymic quality linking it with myth time and events. It is identified as the place where the people stopped in their journey to find the center and were given their clan names and as the spot where the Twin War Gods were created. Another such location that derives its importance primarily from its initial association with mythic events, although it includes rock art images associated with ritual activity, is the site of the stone pillars described earlier as the boy and girl who were sacrificed to Kolowisi, the Horned Water Serpent. Accord- ing to the accounts of some ethnographers, these pillars are shrines visited by parents seeking to ensure the gender of a future child (Fewkes 1891:9-10; Kirk 1943:237; M. Stevenson 1887:539-540; 1904:294-295). Thus, couples who want a boy go to the stone said to represent the boy; those who want a girl go to the shrine representing the girl. The latter, which received most of the early ethnographers' attention, seems also to function more generally as a fertility shrine for women who have been childless. I have little to add from personal observation because I was told that during my first fieldwork at Zuni this shrine was still in use and warned not to go near it. I was, however, told its general location so that I could avoid it, since it was near a rock art site I was permitted to record. Both Stevenson and Fewkes describe the female fertility shrine as consisting of the large stone pillar, surrounded by boulders on which hundreds of female fertility symbols (vagina-like oblongs and triangles) have been carved (Fewkes 1891:9-10; M. Stevenson 1887:539-540; 1904:294-295). Stevenson includes a photograph of this area, which she labels "mother rock," in her major work on Zuni (M. Stevenson 1904: Plate XII). Although I never saw them in such concentration in my fieldwork, I was able to recognize these symbols from Stevenson's photograph and found them to be common elements in most of the rock art of the region surrounding the pueblo. There is evidence to suggest that Zunis do indeed regard some rock art sites as sacred because of the rock art there and not because of any other factors ex- trinsic or prior to the rock art. That is, the power of the site is derived solely 29</page><page sequence="28">M. JANE YOUNG from the image or cluster of images found there. The types of images at such sites may include, of course, those described earlier as myth-evoking. Another site that I was not allowed to see since it is regarded as sacred because of its rock art was described to me as being a cave on the walls of which was painted a Kolowisi, the Plumed Water Serpent, a particularly dangerous and powerful being in Zuni mythology. When I asked to see the cave, the sheepherder35 who used that land said, "You shouldn't see that because Kolowisi is part of our religion." On the other hand, although he did ask me not to take photographs, one religious leader had no apparent reserva- tions about leading me to another site and permitting me to see the images of six Kolowisi painted in the colors of the six directions. This site also contained figures and masks of the most powerful kachinas in the Zuni pantheon: the six Shalako and the Council of the Gods. As I shall discuss in greater detail later, power seems to accrue particularly to painted images of masks in the rock art. Interestingly, this power seems to belong to the painted images of masks but not particularly to carved images of the same, suggesting, perhaps, that there is power in the paint itself (Bunzel 1932:519). If rock art images have power, a power that can be imparted to the places where they are made, then several images placed in close proximity to one another might make that place even more powerful.36 For example, published pictures of the "fertility shrine" mentioned above show a surface covered with hundreds of female fertility symbols. The repetition of images on single panels or on several surfaces in a small area, often executed at different time periods, is not an uncommon phenomenon although rarely as extensive as in the example cited above. Panels with multiple handprints or footprints, rows of mountain sheep, deer, birds, animal tracks, geometric designs, or strikingly similar masks and kachina figures are found recurring at single sites, or even throughout the entire region. Such sites seem to be characterized by specific dominant themes related, perhaps, to ritual activity and power or, in some cases, to the demarcation of clan areas. Handprints, footprints, and animal tracks (Figures 12 and 13) are of par- ticular significance because they are often regarded as "signatures," both in the rock art of this region and in many other areas as well. For example, Schaafsma states that the handprint in rock art of the southwestern Indians "served as a means of identification," dating from extremely early times (i.e., the Basketmaker period) up to the present (1980:119). Another source sug- gests that handprints were often used to mark a sacred place, a practice that, according to Ellis and Hammack, is still carried on by modern Pueblo Indians: Tracing one's hand on the wall of a sacred place brings a blessing into one's self, like "taking the breath" from any sacred object. Moreover, at completion of a ceremony, the leader may whiten his hand and press it against the kiva or other wall to signify that he has carried out his religious duty. [1968:35] In the rock art of the Zuni-Cibola region, handprints are most frequently executed in red paint although one spectacular site includes such prints in 30</page><page sequence="29">IMAGES OF POWER Figure 12.

These prints are quite faded and do not appear to have been made with modern pastel paints (Young 1982:68-69). As with pictographic images of masks, much of the power of painted handprints may derive from the very fact that they are painted. Seemingly related is the practice, described in the ethnographic literature, of marking a house, room, or kiva with a handprint after its plastering, a task traditionally done by women (M. Stevenson 1904:349-350). Stevenson describes one such print found at a site excavated near Santa Fe: "An impres- sion of a hand and arm in color, probably of a maiden, was found on the wall. Such evidences of maidenly vanity are still to be seen in pueblo houses of the present time" (M. Stevenson 1904:15-16). Although I would not describe such "signatures" in Stevenson's somewhat biased terms, I, too, have seen handprints on the ceilings of houses I visited at Zuni. Human footprints occur in the rock art of the Zuni-Cibola region with 31 A-.-14 -...,. -r--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~r-:~*</page><page sequence="30">M. JANE YOUNG almost the same frequency as handprints (Figure 12), although rarely as pic- tographs. Perhaps they too, like handprints, mark sacred areas or serve as in- dividual signatures. In fact, as the following suggests, the footprint can even be used in certain contexts to embody the essence of an individual. In describ- ing the mudheads or Koyemshi at Zuni, Parsons states that, "Into the knobs of the masks are put bits of soil from the people's tracks about the town. This device gives the koyemshi power over the people and it is probably the prime reason for the great reverence in which the koyemshi are held" (1917:167). Rock art images of animal and bird tracks (Figure 13) were most frequently those of the deer, the bear, the wolf, the turkey, and the crane. Most of these animals are conceived of either as predators or prey and, as with the carvings of full images of these same animals, these tracks may have been depicted on the rocks to ensure success in the hunt. However, such tracks were also identified by many Zunis as symbols of the particular clans associated with these birds or animals. This identification of some images as clan symbols,37 including those ^ r q' g ? .-:.:^ 7 ? _* cm. z* 4 ,{Ull}"~i~-~" ' 4 '3X Figure 13. Animal tracks. All pecked and from Site 17.

Informants who suggested that some of these oft-repeated images were clan symbols or clan signatures based their opinion not only on oral traditions and scholarly writings associating clan sym- bols with certain sites (Parsons 1939:359; M. Stevenson 1904:40-42) but also on their expressed opinion that "it is good to have pictures of your clan animal around you."38 Not surprisingly, people were delighted to receive photo- graphs of rock art depictions of their clan animal which they could hang in their houses. The carving of clan symbols by Hopi participants in the extremely dangerous annual salt gathering pilgrimage has been described by Michaelis (1981) among others (Simmons 1942:234; Titiev 1937:244-258; Wellmann 1979:6). According to Michaelis: On the way, the participants stopped and engraved their clan emblems on a Rock Shrine they named Tuteveni (Writing). On subsequent trips, the same man would repeat his signature to the left of the original sign. This explains the series of identical signs carved one next to the other. [1981:9] Pilgrimages are central events in Zuni ceremonial life as well (Bunzel 1932: 520n, 538; Parsons 1939:478; M. Stevenson 1904:153-162), and it is quite possible that the repeated symbols on certain individual rocks or at certain sites are the clan emblems of participants in such pilgrimages produced in com- memoration of these journeys. Some rock art scholars have suggested that pictographs and petroglyphs of clan and similar symbols may have also served to mark tribe, family, and clan territories, especially those used for hunting, farming, and grazing (Wellmann 1979:9-10; Forde 1931:368; Voth 1905:23). More specifically, Wellmann has stated that "in Arizona, a number of Hopi clan symbols were apparently carved on rocks in order to delineate communal lands" (1979:10). At Zuni, too, single images repeated over and over again on one or more panels at given sites may have been created for this reason. Such repetition is not, of course, always a signature marking a clan area. As already noted, repeated images may be related to ritual activity at that site, and their repetition may have been intend- ed to give power to the place or to augment its already existing power. Identical or similar motifs are repeated on single rock surfaces or at par- ticular sites and even throughout several different sites, especially when those sites are all relatively close together. Among the repeated motifs I found are nearly identical geometric designs, bird figures, and kachina masks. At Hant- lipinkia, for example (Figure 3), there is a "circle-line-zigzag" mask complex consisting of 13 strikingly similar images all located in the same enclosed and fairly inaccessible area at the head of the canyon (Schaafsma and Young 1983). At another rock art site near the pueblo, there are 11 almost identical bird-like figures, some placed at considerable distances from one another but all still within the same site. Very similar images are also found at other sites near the 33</page><page sequence="32">M. JANE YOUNG pueblo and even at one site 57 miles away in Arizona. One informant, an ar- tist, suggested that extensive repetition of a single element throughout some area or region may reflect the use of that land by certain clans and family groups who had developed "their own style and type of art" (see also Cushing 1920:153). It is possible also that such a repeated image may have been made by several unrelated individuals over a period of time, either because of its par- ticular meaning, known to them but not to us, or because individuals some- times chose, for whatever reason, to repeat and continue earlier, already- present themes. In any case, it is difficult to believe that the many similar im- ages at some of the more extensive sites were all created by a single person. Of course, not all images appearing together were produced at the same time. There is, perhaps, an unsuspected dynamic aspect to rock art. Old im- ages erode with time or may be purposely altered or destroyed. New images may be made around them, thus altering the context in which they are viewed and, perhaps, their power as well. Older sites often contain images clearly made at several distinct time periods as well as particular images that have been subjected to later modifications. New images are sometimes even produced on top of older images (Figure 3B). Superimposition is, in fact, relatively common in rock art throughout the Southwest and has often been of great value in establishing the relative dates of particular styles and techniques. The frequen- cy with which such superimposition occurs, despite the availability of nearby suitable unused surfaces, and the often reduced clarity of the resulting images suggest that the decision to use such places is not random but quite purposeful. Perhaps this is because the superimposition of a second image over the first in- creases the power of the second image and, in addition, of the place as well. Sometimes new images are placed, not on top of older images, but next to these images in a way that suggests a meaningful relationship. Two photo- graphs taken 50 years apart, of a panel containing several painted masks at the site called the Village of the Great Kivas, clearly indicate this dynamic aspect while simultaneously demonstrating that rock art remains a continuing art form at Zuni. To see the changes that occurred during a 50-year period, com- pare Figure 14, taken in 1930 by Frank H. H. Roberts, with Figure 15, taken from the same angle in the summer of 1980. Many of the older images have been partially worn away; a few have disappeared entirely. New images have been added, sometimes on top of the older, worn images. Most of the kachina images added since the time of Roberts's photograph have been placed near those with which they have a ceremonial relationship. For example, the figures of the Council of the Gods are all placed as close to one another on this rock art panel as possible without obliterating the earlier painted masks.39 The white- painted masks of Sayatasha, Hututu (Sayatasha's assistant), and one of the Salimobia have all been added since Roberts's photograph was taken (see figure caption for identifications). Significantly, the masks of Hututu and the new Salimobia were both placed near the already-present Salimobia mask, the color of which was changed from white to red. Thus, there are now two Salimobia masks present, the red mask of the Salimobia of the south and the white mask 34</page><page sequence="33">IMAGES OF POWER Figure 14.

JANE YOUNG of the Salimobia of the east.40 Most of the other masks and figures on this panel are those that appear in the mixed kachina dance.41 The juxtaposition of images in a way that reflects their ceremonial relation- ships is best illustrated, perhaps, by the recent addition of an image to the other panel of masks at this site. Figure 16 is a photograph of the end of this panel taken in the summer of 1980; note the empty space next to the deer mask. Figure 17 was taken in the summer of 1981; note the new image. Despite the differences in style and coloring, there was an evident attempt to place the new image on the rock face in such a manner as to make it appear to have been done at the same time as the deer. Several Zunis identified this added image as a wild ram, an animal having a status similar to that of the deer. In the past, the two comprised the most important game animals for the Zunis. These are the animal figures that appear most commonly with spears or arrows through their bodies in early rock art. Their relationship is also made very clear in Zuni oral tradition. The deer and ram "go together" at the mixed kachina dance. They dance close to one another and are led away together from the other dancers when they are to be "fed" in one of the ceremonial rooms. The masks of these animals painted on the cliff walls at the Village of the Great Kivas are almost identical to those worn in the dance. All the participants in the mixed kachina dance are males who must have been initiated into the Hunters' Society. In fact, the impersonation of game animals by members of the Hunters' Society in the mixed dance is regarded as giving these hunters the power to attract the animals when hunting; the impersonation may be said to draw the animals to the hunters. This again emphasizes the importance at- tached to the visual depiction of game animals as a means to achieve success in the hunt and is, perhaps, another instance of the invocation of power. This rock art site is powerful not only because of the juxtaposition and superimposition of images through time, but also because of the images themselves-the numerous painted kachina masks-represented here (Figures 11, 14-17). The power of the mask is so great that even the Zuni gods or kachinas themselves wear such masks (M. Stevenson 1898:36). Zunis regard masks as having the power of transformation; when the dancers don their masks, they become the kachinas, taking on their names and personalities (Bunzel 1932:844, 862, 902; M. Stevenson 1904:88, 252). In this way, the mask compels the presence of the god. Owing to their power, masks may also be dangerous. A dancer who does not observe the proper taboos may, for ex- ample, be killed by his mask. Bunzel recounts a Zuni story of one such instance in which the mask stuck to a man's face and suffocated him (Bunzel 1932:845). Like a mask itself, the image of that mask may also be powerful, particularly when that image is painted; the masks at the Village of the Great Kivas are all painted primarily in those colors that are associated with the direc- tions, that is, yellow, blue, red, white, speckled, and black. It would appear, furthermore, that just as a real mask can be both powerful and dangerous, so too can the rock art depiction of such a mask if it is abused. I was told, for in- stance, that a well-known Zuni potter probably would not want to talk to me 36</page><page sequence="35">IMAGES OF POWER Figure 16.

JANE YOUNG about rock art imagery because the death of her son the year before was at- tributed to the fact that he had "copied" the Comanche mask at this site. It must be added, however, that the word "copied" was not explained, and that, further, the idea of accidental death is not accepted at Zuni-there must always be a reason-and such reasons may not be truly intended as causal ex- planations (D. Tedlock 1975:253-260). Bunzel has suggested that it is the paint on the mask, more than its overall form, that gives it its power (Bunzel 1932:862). She adds that when the dancers are inside the kiva and no masks are being used, the same magical power resides in the paint that is applied to their faces and bodies. This paint is always applied, even when a costume and mask are to be worn over it (Bunzel 1932:519). That power may be attributed to the paint itself is further supported by the comment one Zuni elder made to me that when new images are to be painted on kiva walls, the old ones are scraped off and the paint fragments are buried in a sacred place outside the pueblo. Finally, it may be of some significance that the images at this site, with the ex- ception of the one painted since the summer of 1980, are generally attributed by Zunis to one or another well-known mask painter of the 1920s and 1930s, for only special officers of the kiva are permitted to paint the masks. Further- more, the painting of the new mask, the wild ram, is attributed by some Zunis to the son of one of these earlier mask painters. Not all rock art images surrounding the pueblo are regarded by Zunis as ' d i m Figure 18. Incised dancer, attributed to Roger Tsabetsaye, 30 cm x 17 cm, Site 7. Drawing from slide by Murray Callahan. 38</page><page sequence="37">IMAGES OF POWER powerful, however. One man, a recognized artist, looked through my photo- graphs and picked out several images (all from the same rock art site but not all together in my stack of photographs) that he had carved when he was a young sheepherder. He asked for copies of these photographs so that he could hang them in his store alongside his other artwork. Next to one of these images he had also carved his first name and last initial (Figure 18). This is one of the few examples of rock art I have seen that has been signed by the artist. Other Zunis to whom I showed a photograph of this image readily identified the artist, perhaps because of his name but also, they said, because "he does paintings like that." When I asked this man his reason for doing the carving, he replied, "looking at other rock carvings inspires you to do your own." He added, moreover, that in his opinion rock art is done today at Zuni "for the sake of art, not religious significance." This comment from a well-known artist il- lustrates a somewhat different perspective from that of the religious leaders who tended to see certain rock art images as powerful and linked to the time of the myth. Because this artist is in his early 40s, it may also illustrate the differ- ing attitudes of the elders and the younger, more acculturated members of the tribe. Some of the other men remembered having created rock art when they were younger as a way of passing time while sheepherding. One of them said: .. we were just young boys with nothing to do. We'd go up on the rocks after school and on weekends, just go walking around and sometimes carve things on the rocks. He especially remembered having carved, from memory, a map of the pueblo which he now wished he could find in order to see how things have changed. When I asked him for his thoughts on why rock art was done in the past, he responded: They've seen something like this-strange figures; They carved this to remember what it was like, just to remember ... They carved kachinas and stuff like that because they were always thinking about them and didn't want to forget how they were dressed.42 But as he was sorting the cards and came to some of those images of "anthro- pomorphs" that seemed so perplexing to most of my informants and were commonly categorized as "unknowns," he suggested that they might have some kind of hidden meaning and mused, "I wonder what these really repre- sent. " Rock art images were sometimes interpreted by my informants in a rather mundane way. The same man who interpreted a concentric circle design as "a 39</page><page sequence="38">M. JANE YOUNG Figure 19. Incised deer, 15 cm x 15 cm, Site 7. Photo by Nancy L. Bartman, 1979. big old car tire" was very interested in rock art and sometimes took me to sites he thought I would like to photograph. At one site he said, "Watch out for snakes. There are lots of snakes in this area. That's why there are so many snakes carved on the rocks here." Furthermore, many of the square and rec- tangular fringed designs carved or pecked on the rocks were said to be rug, blanket, or pottery designs put there for "practice." Some Zuni informants also discussed the aesthetics of individual images. For example, many of the most recent images were regarded as beautiful because of their bright colors or excellence of form. Most of these images are small, quite detailed, carved with a metal tool such as a pen knife, and highly representa- tional (Figures 18 and 19, for example). I was often asked for copies of my photographs of these images. Some of these photographs now adorn the walls of a number of Zuni homes; others have served as design patterns for pottery. Among the older images those regarded as beautiful were the "designs," the same geometric or extremely nonrepresentational figures that were thought by some to embody undecipherable messages. Conclusion My interest in contemporary Zunis' perceptions of the rock art about them arose initially from a desire to get at the meaning and function of that rock art. Too often, studies of rock art have ignored the context in which such art is in- itially produced and in which it continues to exist as an almost permanent part 40</page><page sequence="39">IMAGES OF POWER of the landscape. Frequently, of course, little or no such data are available. The rock art at Zuni, however, offers a corpus of material that is located in close proximity to a group of people who have lived in that locale for hundreds of years and who, furthermore, have demonstrated a high degree of cultural con- tinuity. Although influences from other, neighboring cultures are in clear evidence, and some images are the products of non-Zunis, most of the rock art in that area probably was produced by ancestors of the Zunis, both recent and distant. Furthermore, it continues to be produced to this day by some tribal members. In such a context, it seemed reasonable and possible to seek for clues to the meanings and functions of these petroglyphs and pictographs, not only in the archaeology of the area but also in the extensive ethnographic material col- lected over the past 100 years and in the comments of contemporary Zunis con- cerning their perceptions of what these figures were and to what they might refer. But the limitations inherent in this approach had to be recognized and kept in mind at all times. First of all, traditional forms of expressive culture have certainly been affected by the widespread consequences of the social and cultural changes that have occurred since many of these ethnographies were written. Still, despite such changes, the form, meaning, and function of Zuni verbal and visual arts give evidence of striking continuities over that period, and the core of Zuni social organization and religious activity seems to have re- mained fundamentally constant. Thus, it seemed reasonable to use this material to supplement and add depth to the data I gathered through my work with contemporary Zunis. Secondly, the rock art produced in prehistoric times was most likely produced for entirely different reasons than it is today. Moreover, specific design elements may have changed through time, or, where they haven't, their meanings may have. For these reasons, the identifications of specific rock art images and the explanations of their meanings I elicited from contemporary Zunis probably proved most informative with respect to those more representationally drawn images of relatively recent date (post-A.D. 1325) that are similar to those found in other forms of Zuni visual art, especially those still used in a religious context with respect to which they have symbolic meanings still known and understood by many Zunis. Nor can one assume that contemporary interpretations necessarily reflect traditional Zuni ideas concerning these images. The Zuni area has been the subject of con- siderable anthropological and archaeological study, and the Zuni culture has been influenced by the written records thus created. Such documents have been read by many Zunis and have sometimes given greater status and broader distribution to idiosyncratic Zuni interpretations than they might otherwise have had. In some instances, contemporary Zuni interpretations demonstrably reflect the influence of such "distorting feedback"; likewise, in other in- stances, their interpretations clearly derive from ideas to which they have been recently introduced by sources outside the culture (Young 1982:150-157). For all these reasons, contemporary interpretations must be projected onto prehistory or even onto recent history only with the greatest caution and with 41</page><page sequence="40">M. JANE YOUNG a full recognition of the dynamic aspects of tradition, the change as well as the continuity. Whatever they can tell one about the past, however, such interpretations can clearly serve to illuminate the present. On the one hand, contemporary in- terpretations of the older, more ambiguous images in the rock art quite likely had very little to do with the "original" meanings or functions of these im- ages. On the other hand, the manner in which they were related to events described in the Zuni origin myth or, in the case of some of the most amor- phous images at least, to the time of the myth, was extremely revealing of the process by which Zunis make these images meaningful to themselves by draw- ing them into their network of symbolic relations. Perhaps the most revealing statement concerning the contemporary attitude toward these images was made by an elderly religious leader who spent three hours, mostly in silence, looking at an extensive rock art site. During this time, he often approached a figure and gently traced its outline with his finger- tips. Finally he said, "I don't know what it means, but I know it is impor- tant.

Leibman, and Joan Lidoff for their critical comments and suggestions on earlier drafts of this paper. 1 The term "Zuni" is used to refer to the people, the place, and the language. As is clear from my bibliography, early anthropologists at Zuni wrote the word as "Zufii," but that pronunciation and spell- ing are not used by the tribe today, simply "Zuni." The Zunis generally refer to themselves as A:shiwi, which translates into English as "the people." 2 An excellent bibliographic essay by Barbara and Dennis Tedlock (included in Woodbury 1979) delineates the most important works on Zuni ceremonialism, household activities, legal system, kinship, attitudes toward witchcraft, and verbal and graphic arts. 3 Ladd (1979) provides a list of contemporary Zuni clans. 4 I thank Simon Bronner for pointing out to me that Stewart Culin did discuss Zuni art, including "pictures on rocks," in one of his earlier articles (1927). Culin's treatment of both rock art and Zuni aesthetics is very general, however, and he refers to rock art as "painted or pecked by children on the rocks" (1927:48). 5 The various rock art sites in the Zuni locale that have been documented and placed in a tentative tem- poral framework are described in Young (1982:31-92). 42</page><page sequence="41">IMAGES OF POWER 6 For a detailed discussion of the archaeology of the Zuni-Cibola region, including the various interac- tional spheres of prehistoric and historic groups, see Eggan and Pandey (1979), Rinaldo (1964), and Woodbury (1979). 7 See Young (1982:49-63) and Young and Bartman (1981) for a more thorough treatment of style and chronology for rock art of the Zuni-Cibola region. 8 As used here and throughout this paper, "panel" refers to an expanse of image-bearing rock, general- ly a single rock face, treated as a unit. 9 Schaafsma (1980:105-162, 243-289) discusses these styles and their spheres of influence in rock art of the American Southwest. 10 Except where otherwise noted, the Zuni commentary referenced in this paper is from fieldwork con- ducted at Zuni Pueblo during the summers of 1979-1981 and 1983-1984. I have omitted the names of Zuni individuals largely because opinions within the community toward giving aid to outsiders vary con- siderably. Since my project did not involve the documentation of shrine areas, and people generally did not regard rock art as a subject that should not be discussed, I have no reason to suspect that people told me tribal secrets. I do feel, however, that it is important to maintain the privacy of those with whom I talked. 11 "Informant" is hardly even the appropriate word for those with whom I worked. "Colleagues in the field," "consultants," or simply "friends" would be more accurate, but the use of such terms might be confusing or awkward in this context. 12 See Lewis-Williams's account (1981:36) of a similar situation. Lewis-Williams showed photographs of animal and human figures to his South African informants and found that they identified animal images "with ease" but had difficulty with human figures. 13 For a discussion that outlines the relationship between myth and artifact in similar terms see Glassie (1977:1-49). 14 In general, this division into such time periods in the card-sorting experiment is my own synthesis, based on my establishment of a temporal framework for the rock art of this area and was not a distinction made by my informants with the exception of two individuals who divided images into groups of "old" and "contemporary." 15 I am grateful to Richard Bauman for suggesting that I pursue this idea. 16 My thinking on this subject has been greatly influenced by Dell H. Hymes. Particularly influential was a colloquium in which he described a similar conception of myth time and space for Chinookan peoples (1979). See also Hymes (1977:446) for a discussion of "the eternal presence for the myth world" in Chinookan culture. 17 For similar accounts recorded in the ethnographic literature on Zuni see Benedict (1935:3-5), Bunzel (1932:584-591), Cushing (1896:383-384), M. Stevenson (1904:28) and D. Tedlock (1972:264; 1975: 268). 18 The terminology I use here, although similar to that used by other scholars, is from my own transla- tions of Zuni materials, especially Young (1978). For subsequent discussion of the finished/raw contrast, I rely most heavily on my own translations and on Zuni commentary about these terms I recorded during my fieldwork. 19 Both Bunzel (1932:592) and D. Tedlock (1981:45-64) cite instances of a narration of the origin myth during which the narrator recites that the people journeyed for four days. The narrator then adds (either as an aside or part of the narration) that it was four years. Tedlock suggests that this is due to the special way that time is perceived in this context. For a more general discussion of myth as explaining "the present and the past as well as the future," see Claude Levi-Strauss (1955:84-85). 20 For more detail about how the Zunis and, more generally, the Pueblo Indians perceive astronomical phenomena such as the apparent motion of the sun, moon, and stars as well as less "regular" occurrences such as eclipses and meteor showers, see Young (1985). 21 In addition to the previously noted versions of the Zuni origin myth, all of which emphasize the ceremonial importance of the number four, Hymes (1980:7-51) demonstrates that the number four is also central in the repetition and patterning of Zuni narrative verse. 22 This description of the semi-cardinal directions as the "ritual" directions and counter-clockwise as the ritual order is a generalization. I am grateful to Barbara and Dennis Tedlock for pointing out to me that at Zuni the use of cardinal versus semi-cardinal directions, as well as the use of clockwise versus counter-clockwise, depends on the particular ceremonial context. 23 Hallowell suggests that the Northern Ojibwa Indians regard power and mediation in a similar man- 43</page><page sequence="42">M. JANE YOUNG ner: "Human beings are conceived of as intrinsically weak and helpless. . . . Consequently, it is essential that assistance be secured from other-than-human selves" (1955:104). He adds that for the Ojibwa in- dividual, the "fundamental differentiation of primary concern to the self is how other selves rank in order of power" (1955:181). 24 According to Cushing, the Prey God fetishes used in hunting are the same animals as the Beast Gods with these exceptions: the coyote replaces the bear of the west; the wild cat replaces the badger of the south; and the red-tailed hawk is added to the eagle of the zenith (1883:20-30). 25 Although some Zunis identified these animals as "Beast Gods," most used the term uemaule. Because I have some knowledge of the Zuni language, I was able to follow and translate such terms. Often, particularly for the "animal" category, my informants gave only the Zuni name, in accord with one man who repeatedly said, "I don't know what it is in English." See Kirk (1943:235) for the descrip- tion of a similar situation, i.e., "In Zuni it would be easy to explain, but hard to tell it in English." 26 Although an informant who went with me to this site described these as "the Kolowisi of the six directions," references in the ethnographic literature usually mention Kolowisi only in relation to the four directions; see D. Tedlock (1979:499). For a discussion of Kolowisi as both individual and multiple in Zuni thought, see Bunzel (1932:515-516). 27 Hallowell cites a similar "build-up of associations" of the directions with symbolic and mythological meanings for the Northern Ojibwa Indians, asserting that it is such associations that make the directions "meaningful places" (1955:201). 28 Note in this quotation the reference to the marks of the flood as an "explanation" of the banded sandstone comprising the mesa of Corn Mountain. For the association of Kolowisi with the flood see Benedict (1935:10-11), Bunzel (1932:516), Chamberlain (1978), and M. Stevenson (1904:84, note f). Kirk (1943:237) gives a rendition of this story similar to the one Chamberlain taped, including the description of the resultant two stone pillars as related to fertility shrines. However, she does not mention Kolowisi in relation to the flood story. 29 See Young (1982:143-150) for more detail concerning descriptions of ceremonies evoked by images in the "anthropomorph" category. I don't include such detail in this paper because my purpose here is to discuss narrative-evoking images. 30 Although it is the practice of this journal to discourage the use of the designation "n.d.," I have been forced to retain this term in referring to the ethnographic material of Harrington, Hodge and Cushing, and Roberts, both in the paper proper and the references cited, because these works consist of unpublished notes and manuscripts covering an undated and, sometimes, undefined span of years. The in- stitutions that house these works use the term n.d., and it would be inappropriate and inaccurate for me to deviate from their practice by assigning estimated dates to these extensive materials. 31 The terms, "hieroglyphs" and "designs," were often used by my informants to describe rock art, especially geometric figures. This may relate to the present-day idea that rock art constitutes a "message" from the ancestors although it is in no way a suggestion that each image literally represents a Zuni word. 32 Occupied during the early part of the 11th century, this area contains the ruins of a large, multi- roomed living complex that included two large and several smaller circular kivas. For a discussion of the rock art here, see Young (1982:66). Roberts (1932) describes the archaeological work conducted at this site. 33 Zunis made these and the following identifications as well as those listed in the captions for Figures 11 and 14-17. 34 Glassie (1973:344) deals with the selective acceptance of the new in a changing society and the "evolution from old things to new things," providing useful parallels to the situation at Zuni. 35 The Zunis with whom I worked never called themselves "shepherds," but used the term "sheepherders" instead. 36 For an analysis of the relationship of power to the juxtaposition and superimposition of images, see Armstrong (1981:95-96). 37 See Ladd (1979:487, Table 2) for the list of current Zuni clans. 38 For a description of clan symbols painted on the backs of runners in ceremonial foot races, see M. Stevenson (1904:322). 39 See Bunzel (1932:941-946, 969-975) and M. Stevenson (1904:33, 227-241) for a description of this group of kachinas and their role in Zuni ritual life. 40 There are six pairs of Salimobia, one pair for each of the six directions, which are painted in the col- ors associated with those directions. 44</page><page sequence="43">IMAGES OF POWER 41 Members of the Hunters' Society are involved in ceremonial hunts and are called upon to dance in the mixed kachina dance in which animals are impersonated. See especially Kirk (1943:195-198) for men- tion of the importance of the deer and mountain sheep impersonators who participate in this dance, in a sense as representatives of the other wild animals this dance will bring to the Zuni hunters. Bunzel describes the mixed dance, wotemlha, as being performed to draw wild animals to the hunters of the pueblo. See Bunzel (1932:906-907, 1025-1026, 1030-1031) for this description, including a list of animals that are impersonated. M. Stevenson (1904:438-441) notes that the Zuni Hunters' Fraternity is made up of huntsmen who, on special occasions, imitate the game they wish to catch. 42 The reader may have noticed that the text on this page is the only one in this paper in which I have attempted to show the poetic structure of the narrative segment by setting it off into poetic lines. Although I expected more Zuni commentary to reveal an internal poetic pattern, the lack of such pattern for the other Zuni quotations used in this paper is probably due to the fact that many of the Zunis with whom I worked did not speak English with the same facility as they do Zuni. Thus, their narratives in English would not reveal the patterning that they may have had if spoken in Zuni. The one man who seemed to "break into performance" was a good friend, at ease with both me and my assistant, and ac- customed to expressing himself in the English language.
