<plain_text><page sequence="1">ASPECTS OF THE RABBINIC CONCEPT OF ISRAEL1 A STUDY IN THE MEKILTA2 By MAX KADUSHIN, New York City I.I. The Concept of Israel5 ISRAEL designates in rabbinic literature, and to us, a specific people, the Jews. It is the concept which expressed and evoked throughout all the stages of this people's history its sense of nationhood. "Scripture," say the Rabbis, "designates them as a a nation, as it says 'And who is like Thy people Israel, a nation one in the earth' (I Chron. 17.21),"•* the Rabbis thus adducing sound Scriptural warrant for their own national self-conscious ness. In whatever respects the rabbinic concept of Israel may differ from its biblical antecedent, the core of the concept, the awareness of nationhood, remains the same. Without the con cept of Israel, or some other equivalent, there would have been no Jewish people, no Bible, no rabbinic literature. It is an excel lent example of the way in which an organic concept interprets, organizes and oft-times creates the facts of experience. The rabbinic concept of Israel, however, has an individuality of its own, certain qualities which distinguish it from its biblical antecedent.5 The Rabbis' high regard for the dignity of Israel, 11 wish to thank Professor Louis Ginzberg for his annotations to these pages; like his annotations to my books The Theology of Seder Eliahu and Organic Organic Thinking, they are marked here with his initials. The Theology of Seder Seder Eliahu is referred to hereafter as TE and Organic Thinking as OT. 1 1 References by volume and page are to Mekilta de Rabbi Ishmael, ed. Jacob Z.

IV, section V. 57</page><page sequence="2">[2] 58 MAX KADUSH1N for instance, results in a kind of equalitarianism that practically nullifies the biblical institution of the Hebrew slave. Menial personal services by the Hebrew slave, such as washing the feet of the master, or helping the latter with his shoes, or carrying him in a litter, are forbidden, though the master's son or pupil, significantly enough, are permitted to do these things.6 The master may not even change the trade of the Hebrew slave, let alone force him to engage in any sort of "humiliating" work.7 The Rabbis interpret "Because he (the slave) fareth well with thee" (Deut. 15.16) to mean that he must fare equally as well as the master, and this interpretation is then applied to the matters of food and drink and bed.8 Indeed, the question is raised whether he should be called "slave" at all, since it is a term of opprobrium.' Again, to the Rabbis, love for one another is implicit in the very term "Israel" itself. "Thine enemy" (Ex. 23.4), they say therefore, cannot really apply to an Israelite at all, and if it does the enmity is such as between a father and son who have quarreled, fleeting and temporary.10 Let us present but one more indication that the rabbinic concept differs, in certain respects, from the biblical concept of Israel. The tre mendous importance of Israel, in the eyes of the Rabbis, renders significant every detail of its history, and so the Rabbis endeavor to make definite and specific what may be indefinite and blurred 6 III, 5-6• 7 III, 6. The passage also discusses other conditions of labor for the Hebrew slave. 8 III, 14. The master must also provide food for the Hebrew slave's wife and children — III, 9-10. י III, 4. In these statements concerning the Hebrew slave, we have an illustration of the manner in which rabbinic theology is imbedded in the Halakah. "On the Hebrew slave see my lectures on קדושין where I show that the tannaitic tradition had no longer any 'facts' about the institution of Hebrew slavery. The tannaitic statements about the עבד עברי prove nothing but that later generations tried to explain from their point of view conditions of the past" — L. G. We have been endeavoring to present "the point of view" of the "later generations" — the rabbinic — arid to indicate that that point of view differed differed from the one which governed and made possible "the conditions of the past," namely, the biblical institution of the Hebrew slave. 10 III, 163-4.</page><page sequence="3">[3] RABBINIC CONCEPT OF ISRAEL 59 in the biblical account. The year in which Israel went out of Egypt did not have to be intercalated;" they went out in the day-time;" they went out armed;13 and, the biblical "six hundred thousand. . . beside children" (Ex. 12.37) means, according to one authority, exclusive of women, children and infants whilst another takes it to be exclusive of women, children and old men.14 The rabbinic concept of Israel has a distinct individuality of its own, then, differs from the biblical concept, despite the unbroken continuity of national self-consciousness. In the pre ceding paragraph, we did no more than to suggest this difference, only touching on a few of the distinctive qualities of the rabbinic concept. The national self-consciousness of Israel in the rabbinic period is, however, like a texture woven of many strands, each with its own rich color yet blending harmoniously with all the rest. In other words, Israel is an organic concept. Its significance is manifold, for it takes on meanings, shadings, connotations, from the other concepts interwoven with it in the rabbinic com plex of thought. More, Israel is a fundamental organic concept. It possesses, therefore, a number of aspects varied and definite enough in their own right to be crystallized into terms, which we characterize as sub-concepts.15 Only by tracing the pattern made by the interrelation of Israel and its sub-concepts with all the other concepts can we begin to grasp the meaning of the concept; but that alone is not sufficient. We must also study the leit-motifs leit-motifs running through the complex as à whole and which affect Israel as they do all the other concepts. These leit-motifs, or emphatic trends as we have called them elsewhere, account, among other things, for such differences between the biblical and the rabbinic concepts of Israel as we have noticed above. In sum, there can be no succinct definition of the concept of Israel. We can merely indicate its relationships and depict its qualities, arid by doing this shed light on the manner of its effectiveness. 111, 14•74 '1 מ •ז ני I, 174• 141&gt; 1°9• 15 On the relation of the fundamental concept to its sub-concepts, see OT, pp. 181-4.</page><page sequence="4">60 MAX KADUSHIN [4] Nationality went hand-in-hand with universality in rabbinic thought, as the modern authorities have noticed.16 What made this "two-fold character" of rabbinic thought possible was not only the universal quality of certain rabbinic concepts but the fact that all the rabbinic concepts, including the concept of Israel, were organically interrelated. Rabbinic thought is a uni tary complex. If, therefore, we recognize certain concepts such as God's love, His justice, Man, Derek Ereç, to be patently uni versai in scope we may be sure that this universal quality is not confined to these concepts alone but affects the other concepts as well. We shall learn that Israel, the very concept expressive of nationality, is strongly affected by the quality of universality. The latter frequently acts as a check upon the former. The or ganic complex of rabbinic thought is extremely flexible, allowing now one concept to be stressed, now another, particularly in the case of the fundamental concepts. Thus, there are occasions when Torah, or God's love, or God's justice are stressed rather than Israel. A concept may then bq so heavily accented, so dis tinctly individualized, that it is entirely dissociated, for the time being, from Israel. Sometimes Israel is even subordinated to another fundamental concept, or vice versa. But universality does more than act as a check upon nationality in rabbinic thought. It combines with nationality in the concept of Gerim, Proselytes, which is a sub-concept of Israel. Rabbinic thought, hence, owes its "two-fold character" to the organic coherence of the concepts as well as to the specific qualities exhibited by the individual concepts. The national self-consciousness, ex pressed through the concept of Israel, itself had the two-fold character of nationality and universality. Broad enough to take universal humanity into its orbit, it also possessed the inestimable advantages of being focussed in the common life and daily ex perience of a living people, the advantages, in other words, of an organic concept. Israel is one of the four fundamental concepts of rabbinic thought, the others being Torah, God's loving-kindness and 16 See G. F. Moore, Judaism, Vol. I, pp. 219 ff. Cf. the references cited ibid., p. 219, note I.</page><page sequence="5">[5] RABBINIC CONCEPT OF ISRAEL 61 God's justice. They àre not fundamental in the sense of being more essential to the rabbinic outlook than the other rabbinic concepts. In an organic complex of thought, all the concepts are equally essential, for the pattern would not be the same were a single concept missing. We have called them fundamental, however, because by tracing the relationships or connections of these four concepts with each other and with the rest of the rabbinic concepts, we can demonstrate the organic interconnect edness of all the concepts in the complex. The four fundamental concepts are constitutive of each other and of all the remaining concepts as well. Since all the concepts are thus interrelated by reason of their common constitutive elements, any concept can combine with any other concept. This interrelation of concepts makes a full analysis of our topic a very long and arduous task. The interweaving of the concept of Israel with the universal concept of God's love, for example, draws into the pattern the concepts of Shekinah, the righteous, the Nations of the World, God's justice — in fact all the concepts of the complex. In this essay, however, we are not offering a full treatment of the topic. We wish merely to suggest the manner in which the concept of Israel, apart from any of its sub-concepts, is affected by the quality of universality in rabbinic thought. For that purpose it is enough to demonstrate the interweaving of Israel only with the other three fundamental concepts. II.II. Torah and Israel The Torah was given to Israel. All the other matters involv ing Torah and Israel flow from this essential relationship. This relationship looms large enough, indeed, to be included on its own accord in another rabbinic concept — the concept of מתן תורה, the giving of Torah. The entire Torah, except for certain specific commandments first given to Adam and "the sons of Noah,"17 was given to Israel. 1ז II, 211. For the six commandments given Adam and the seven given Noah see Genesis R. 16.6 (ed. Theodor, p. 149) and ibid., 26.5 (ed. Theodor, p. 244). Cf. also the references cited by Theodor. Cf. also II, 235/"The ז' מצות</page><page sequence="6">62 MAX KADUSHIN [6] It was not given them at one time. Besides the revelation at Sinai, there were other occasions, both before and after Sinai, when Israel received definite laws and even religious lore. The revelation at Sinai occurred on the sixth day of the third month. The Rabbis declare, however, that "And he took the book of the covenant and read in the hearing of the people" (Ex. 24.7) refers to the fifth day, that is, to the day before the revelation.18 There was, then a "book of the covenant" before the Ten Com mandments were promulgated; and in the different opinions of what this book contained, all brought forward in the same pas sage, we have both a summary of what the Rabbis regarded as earlier revelations and a good illustration of the non-dogmatic character of rabbinic thought. According to one authority, Moses read to Israel "from the beginning of Genesis up to here," whilst another, R. Ishmael, proves from Lev. 26.46 that the book from which Moses read contained the laws concerning "the sabbatical years and the jubilees" as well as "the blessings and the com minations."1' The third opinion, second in order in the passage, is that of Rabbi Judah, the Prince, who says, "He read to them the mizwot (commandments) commanded to Adam and the miz wot wot commanded to the sons of Noah, and the mizwot given Israel in Egypt and at Marah, and (all the rest of the mizwot})."20 As בני נוח is an old tradition and a very important one while that concerning the commandments given to Adam is a later Haggadah (not known to the authorities of the Mishnah) of very little consequence"—L. G. 18II, 210-11. ■' Ibid., 211. 30 Ibid. This opinion is rightly placed second in the passage because it represents a midway position. Like the first in following the textual order of the Bible, it is nevertheless like that of R. Ishmael in its selection of the laws and exclusion, apparently, of the lore. "The text has ושאר כל הסצות כלן, which cannot mean the mizwot which 'had already been given' (as rendered by Lauterbach). Comp. Horovitz {Mechilta{Mechilta d'Rabbi Ismael, ed. Horovitz-Rabin, Frankfurt-am-Main, 1928-31, p. 211) who calls attention to Midrash Tannaim where the reading is מבראשית עד לעיני כל ישראל. Hoffman's emendation is not acceptable since chap. 24 of Exodus narrates that that took place after the revelation on Sinai (v. 18) and there can be no doubt that according to רבי the Torah was completely known to the Patriarchs and Moses before it was revealed — but it was not given up to a later day"—L. g. But see Horovitz-Rabin, ibid., note 13.</page><page sequence="7">[7] RABBINIC CONCEPT OF ISRAEL 63 to the nature of the mizwot given in Egypt21 and at Marah,22 — at Marah "He made for them a statute and an ordinance" (Ex. 15.25)—, there was again no consensus. But besides the laws given before the revelation at Sinai, there were also laws given in "the tent of meeting," after Sinai, and these are also char acterized as diberot, the very term used to designate the Ten Commandments.23 Similarly, "the giving of Torah," an expression usually reserved for the Sinaitic revelation, is also employed to describe the imposition of the Sabbath before that revelation.24 The occasions, both before and after Sinai, when Israel received Torah were thus, in rabbinic thought, of the same nature as the revelation at Sinai — were, indeed, regarded as so many re vela tions. That these revelations could be subject to widely differ ing opinions is of no little significance. It emphasizes that we have to do here not with religious dogmas but with a pattern of religious thought which encouraged differences of opinion. How did the Rabbis regard the revelation at Sinai? We have just learned that it was by no means regarded as the only reve lation of Torah to Israel. This conclusion is confirmed by a closer examination of the term, "the giving of Torah." True, this term (with the necessary grammatical variations) ordinarily refers to the Sinaitic revelation. Jethro heard of "the giving of Torah" and thereupon came to Israel in the Wilderness;25 the earth trembled, and the kings of the Nations of the World were greatly frightened until Balaam assured them God was bringing upon the world neither a flood of water nor a flood of fire but was simply "giving Torah to His people Israel";26 it was on the sixth " I. 33-4 and 36-8. 22 II, 94• According to R. Joshua, the Sabbath was among the command ments imposed upon Israel at Marah (cf. also II, 121). An anonymous opinion has it, however, that it was first imposed on the twenty-second day of Iyyar and after Marah though before the revelation at Sinai. ננ II, 215. Ibid.,'*Ibid., 99 — שנתנה להם תורה לישראל. "Reading very doubtful and Lauter bach had no right to put it into the text." — L. G. MI, 162 — פתן תורה; ibid., 174 — שנתן תורה לעפו ישראל. See Zebaljim 116a for the opinions as to whether Jethro came before or after the revelation at Sinai. Cf. also Ibn Ezra and Naljmanides on Ex. 18.1. 26II, 233-34 — נותן תורה לעמו ישראל; ibid., 162-3 — תורה נותן לעמו; cf. also ibid., 198.</page><page sequence="8">64 MAX KADUSHIN [8] day of the third month, Siwan, which fell on a Friday, that "Torah was given to Israel."27 In these and in other passages28 the term refers to the revelation on Sinai ; indeed, in the passages concerning Jethro the term actually stands for, without any additional hint, that revelation. We must not fail to notice, how ever, that our term does'not read "the giving of the Torah" but just "the giving of Torah," that the word "Torah" is not preceded by the definite article.29 It is a general term, not the designation of a single, particular event. Even when standing for the Sinaitic revelation, the term implies, then, that this revelation is only one of a number of revelations of Torah to Israel.30 There was a distinction, nevertheless, between the revelation at Sinai and all the other revelations. At Sinai, according to both the Bible and rabbinic theology, Torah was not only revealed to Israel but in the presence of Israel; the revelation was thus experienced by the entire people. The Rabbis, as usual, enlarge upon the biblical narrative. The earth shook, and all the Nations of the World were frightened.31 The people of Israel, too, stand 27 Ibid., 99 — ניתנה חורה לישראל. "The day of the giving of Torah" — יום מתן תורה — ibid., 202. 28II, 198, 236. 2י See the term as given in the preceding references. Lauterbach, reflect ing the common conception, always translates the term as "the giving of the Torah." The Rabbis use the definite article התורה (the Torah), ■only when they wish to convey the idea of the Torah as a whole. Examples: "They will neglect the Torah" (בטלים מן ההורה) — I, 171; "they will absorb the Torah" (והתורה נבללת בגופן)—ibid.; R. Simon ben Yohai's statement — ibid.; "will you accept the Torah" (מקבלים אתם את התורה) — II, 234 (bis). I do not think that there is any violation of the rule in the phrase "for the purpose of giving them the Torah" (נד' ל'תן להם את התורה) — I, !74• This phrase does not have ref erence to the Sinaitic revelation only but to all the other revelations in the Wilderness, as well. R. Joshua, its author, insists that the commandments to observe the Sabbath and to honor one's parents were given at Marah, a revelation that preceded the one on Sinai — II, 94. 30 "Comp. however: אמרה תורה — without the definite article though it means Scripture. This shows that תורה is sometimes treated as personified, and hence no article is added." — l. g. But is it found here as a personification? Is it active in any way? When the Rabbis wish to convey the idea of the Torah as a whole; they do employ the article, as demonstrated in the previous note. 31 See above.</page><page sequence="9">[9] RABBINIC CONCEPT OF ISRAEL 65 ing huddled together, were terrified by the earthquakes, thunder and lightning.32 The thunder and lightning were not of the ordi nary kind but were heard by each Israelite according to his own powers.33 The people stood literally "below the mount" (Ex. 19. 17), for "the mount was pulled up from its place and the people came near and stood under it."34 Again, "stood afar off" (Ex. 20. 18) is to be taken literally, for they moved backward twelve miles and then forward again twelve miles as each Commandment was pronounced.35 So overpowering was the whole experience that more than the Ten Commandments — given in ten sounds "mouth to mouth"36—the people simply had not the strength to receive.37 Conceived as the great spiritual experience in which the entire people shared and hence depicted in the most vivid and dramatic imagery, the revelation at Sinai was the most memorable of all the revelations. In contrast to all other reve lations, says Ginzberg, it was a direct revelation.38 All this implies, obviously, that the Sinaitic revelation possessed, for the Rabbis, a significance greater than that of the other revelations of Torah;39 and that wtmld account for the fact that when the term "the giving of Torah" is used it ordinarily refers to the Sinaitic revelation. The term is essentially, however, of a general character, inclusive of all the occasions when, according to the Rabbis, there were revelations of Torah to Israel.40 2נ II, 219• 33 Ibid., 266-67. 34 Ibid., 219. 3s Ibid., 269; cf. also ibid., 202. 3' Ibid., 95. 3' Ibid., 269-70. 38"The revelation on Sinai was, in contrast to all other revelations, a direct direct one. The Rabbis insisted that this revelation was not through an angel; comp. my remarks in Eine unbekannte jiidische Sekte (New York, 1922), p. 246 f." — L. G. 39 This bears out the analysis of the relation of significance to the emphatic trends in OT pp. 246-7. Here there is a combination of emphatic trends. 4° ר' צבי ה' חיות in his (אלה המצות (זלקווא, תקצ"ו, Chap. 11, seeks to demon strate the thesis that all the mizwot previously revealed were again confirmed on Sinai. Even according to Chajes' reasoning, however, the revelation at Marah apparently possessed a character similar to that of the revelation on</page><page sequence="10">66 MAX KADUSHIN [10] Israel accepted the commandments of God, again not at one time but on the various occasions when these were revealed. They accepted the Sabbath when it was given them sometime before the revelation at Sinai.41 When Moses finished reading the book of the covenant to them, on the day before the revela tion on Sinai, the people declared, "We accept upon ourselves." Thereupon, Moses sprinkled on the people from the blood of the sacrifice and uttered the formula, "Now. you are bound, held and tied," and told them to come on the morrow and receive "all the mizwot."*2 The people accepted the Ten Commandments by responding to each one as it was given.43 The whole-hearted acceptance of Torah by Israel is contrasted with rejections just as positive by the Nations of the World, none of them being willing to obey any of the Ten Commandments that forbade their ordinary mode of living.44 Logically, of course, the accept ance of God's decrees or commandments presupposes the aware ness or acceptance of God's sovereignty, and this logical procedure is, in fact, attributed by the Rabbis to Israel.4s Obviously, having accepted the Torah, Israel was henceforth committed to the practice of it. "The words of Torah are obligatory upon you."46 The revelations of' Torah but gave Israel the possibility, afforded the people the opportunity, to acquire Torah. Actual acquisition of Torah was achieved only through the process of laborious and painstaking study. Moses was told by God that Sinai, for, as Chajes points out, the Rabbis say that at Marah certain mizwot previously given were confirmed again. Chajes' approach to the entire question is decidedly rationalistic. The corner-stone of his argument is the view of Maimonides, and he utilizes again and again the latter's statement that the Patriarchs and the others vouch safed divine commandments prior to the revelation on Sinai, attempted to impart these mizwot to mankind, not on the basis that they were divine com mands, but by means of argumentation, teaching, reason. ■1י II, 122-3; cf. II, 119. ^ II, 210—11. "נעשה ונשמע (Ex. 24.7) means according to the Rabbis: We shall do what we shall hear" — l. g. 45 II, 229.

Nor was this sufficient: they must not only learn the Torah but must be able to repeat it. Nor was even this sufficient: they must be taught until everything is clear to them, orderly, "like a set table."47 It was that Israel might absorb the Torah that God had them take a circuitous route in the Wilderness. "God said: If I bring Israel into the Land now, every man will immediately take hold of his field or his vineyard and neglect the Torah. But I will make them go round about in the Wilderness forty years so that, having the manna to eat and the water of the well to drink, they will absorb the Torah."48 In the Wilderness, the study of Torah by Israel followed, apparently, each revelation. At Elim (Ex. 15.27), before reaching Sinai, they were occupied, according to R. Eleazar, with the words of the Torah which had been given them at Marah.49 Only by the study and practice of the Torah can Israel re main a spiritual people. The Torah is the covenant between God and Israel, annulled when all the commandments are broken or idolatry practiced.50 To be God's people means to be altogether absorbed with the Torah. "Then ye shall be Mine" (Ex. 19.5) means according to the Rabbis, "you shall be turned to Me and be occupied with the words of the Torah and not be occupied with other matters."51 Israel's acceptance of the Torah is, there fore, linked with their love of God "with all their heart and with &lt;47ד HI,47 HI, I. *8I, 171.

Several individual commandments and practices are also described by the term "covenant": "The covenant of the Sabbath," "The covenant of circumcision" and the injunction against idolatry — II, 204. The Sabbath is, of course, also "a sign" between God and Israel (Ex. 30.13), and the Rabbis add the comment, "But not between Me and the Nations of the World"—■ III, 199 and 204. According to R. Ishmael, God made three covenants with Israel: one at Horeb (Sinai), one in the plains of Moa"b and one on Mt. Gerizim and Mt. Ebal —III, 187. 5' II, 204.</page><page sequence="12">68 MAX KADUSHIN [12] all their soul,"52 for it is the concrete evidence of that love. Israel is God's people only if they are holy. "If you are holy then you are Mine." But what confers holiness upon Israel? "With every new mizwah which God issues to Israel He adds holiness to them."53 This involves, of course, the practice of these command ments. The observance of the Sabbath, for example, "adds holi ness to Israel."54 On the other hand, when Israel cease to engage in Torah, they tend to lose their spiritual character. They be came rebellious soon after they left Egypt, "'because they had been without words of Torah for three days."55 In fact, unless they occupy themselves with the words of the Torah, Israel cannot exist as a people at all.56 When the Rabbis extol Israel they frequently do so in terms of Israel's relation to Torah. Thus, the generation that went out of Egypt loved the Torah and the mizwot, according to the Rabbis. Upon leaving Egypt, the people took the unleavened dough, "their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders" (Ex. 12.34) despite their having with them many beasts of burden. This indicates, says R. Nathan, that "Israel cherished the mizwot."57 Although elsewhere the people journeyed with dissension and encamped with dissension, this was not true when they encamped before Mt. Sinai. Here, as inferred from the word vayyifyan, a singular form, all the people were united, of one accord concerning the acceptance of Torah.58 Before the giving of the Ten Commandments, "all the people answered together and said, 'All that the Lord hath spoken we will will do' (Ex. 19.8)." The Rabbis add: "They did not give this answer with hypocrisy, nor did they get it one from the other, but all of them made up their minds alike."59 God, Himself, ex " II, 53• The term for God here is דשם.

"Happy the people whose words God has approved!"61 We have already seen how the Rabbis depict Israel as accepting the laws on every occasion these have been revealed and how they contrast Israel's acceptance with the Nations' rejection of the Torah. The people or generation that received the Torah were not an ordinary people, in the Rabbis' view. Standing before Mt. Sinai, Israel possessed marked "excellence" : They interpreted the divine word as soon as they heard it, and there were neither blind nor dumb nor deaf nor lame nor fools among them.62 At that time, hon oring the Torah, Israel was "the most beautiful among the nations."63 There can be wide differences of opinion in rabbinic thought, due largely to the different emphasis on one or another of the organic concepts. The following statements, when placed side by side, contradict each other no doubt, but the "contradiction" is merely an instance of the flexibility of organic thinking. Is there a necessary, exclusive, inherent relationship between Torah and Israel? The Rabbis express the idea that there is an inherent relationship between four things, among them Torah and Israel, by observing that Scripture designates each of them by the same term, the common term being "possession" according to one passage64 and "inheritance" according to a kindred passage.65 Again, in contradistinction, say the Rabbis, to the things given Israel conditionally — such as the Temple, for example, which was later destroyed — the Torah was one of the things given unconditionally.66 This statement, too, can only mean that a necessary, inherent bond unites Torah and Israel, and that even 60 II, 229• 61 61 II, 270-1. The same biblical verse (Deut. 5.17) is used as warrant in both midrashim. 6262 II, 267. ®נ II, 270. "Sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely" (Song of Songs 2.14), refers to Israel when engaged in Torah — II, 219 and I, 211. 64II, 75-6. 65 Ibid., 77-8. ®®II, 188-9.</page><page sequence="14">70 MAX KADUSHIN [14] a temporary rupture between them, comparable to the tempo rary loss of the Temple,67 is impossible. The opposite view, how ever, is implied by other passages. "When I gave it (i. e., the Torah) from the very start, I gave it not in the place of a land of darkness, not in a secret place, not in an obscure place. 'I said not: It is unto the seed of Jacob' (Isa. 45.19)— that is, to these only only will I give it."68 "To three things is the Torah likened: To the desert, to fire and to water. This is to tell you that just as these three things are free to all who come into the world, so also are the words of the Torah free to all who come into the world."69 Do such statements imply that Torah and Israel are inherently related? We have before us, manifestly, two opin ions, each the antithesis of the other, and the organic complex is flexible enough to leave room for both. The opinion affirming that there is an inherent bond between Israel and Torah empha sizes the concept of Israel, whilst in the contrary opinion the concept of Torah is accented in such a way as to be dissociated from Israel.70 In the former, the element of nationality comes to the fore; in the latter, the element of universality. The "contra diction" presented by these two opinions goes back, very likely, to differences in temperament between two individuals, or per haps even to the differences in mood of a single individual. Either Israel or Torah may be emphasized also in such man ner as to render one subordinate to the other. When Amalek came to attack Israel, says R. Joshua, Moses' plea to God was that if Israel is destroyed, "who then will read that Book of the Torah which Thou hast given them?"71 In this plea Torah is definitely emphasized, Israel's very existence being justified on the ground of its service in behalf of Torah. The same is obviously 47 The Rabbis believed that the Temple would be ultimately restored. 48II, 199.

See, ibid., Lauterbach's note §12. 70 Commenting on Ex. 12.26, the Rabbis say "Evil tidings were announced to Israel at that time, namely, that the Torah would ultimately be forgotten" — I, 94. Here the meaning is that knowledge of the Torah would be rare among Israel, but not that it would disappear for then there would be nobody even to tell of the law. "Comp. Shabbat 138b." — L.

The organic complex allows emphasis now on this and now on that concept of the complex. In this section we have demonstrated how the concepts of Israel and Torah interweave in rabbinic thought. The Rabbis tell of a number of revelations of Torah to Israel, though the one at Sinai possessed for them the greatest significance. The Rabbis say further that Israel accepted the various command ments on these occasions and that the actual acquisition of Torah was achieved only by painstaking study. Through study and practice of Torah, they declare, does Israel remain a spiritual, holy people; and, when they wish to extol Israel, do so in terms of Israel's relation to Torah. We also found that Torah and Israel can each be accented over the other at different times, thus allowing, on occasion, the element of universality to come to the fore. III. God's Loving-kindness74 and Israel God loves Israel. He is their "Father who is in heaven,"75 and they are "His children"76 or "His sons."77 Parental love is but one form, however, taken by God's all-embracing love for Israel, מ II, 70. 73 III, 199 and 198. "The contrast is not between the Sabbath and Israel but between thf commandment and the instrument (man!) to fulfill it."—L.G.

God is also Israel's Brother'8 and Israel God's loving friends.79 Once, when speaking to Moses, according to the Midrash, God fondly designates Israel as the "congregation of holy men."80 This desig nation is reflective of Israel's religious status and function; of like character are the references to Israel as God's "servants"81 and "ministers."82 For most of these terms there is good biblical warrant; and the following list occurring as a single block is unequivocally biblical: "Thy people, Thy herd, Thy flock, the flock of Thy pasture, the seed of Abraham Thy friend, the chil dren of Isaac Thine only one, the congregation of Jacob, Thy first-born son, the vine which Thou didst pluck up out of Egypt and the stock which Thy right hand hath planted."83 When the Rabbis depict God's love for Israel by means of such terms of endearment they have, therefore, sound biblical authority, al though a certain tender, personal quality is rather more pro nounced in the rabbinic terms. We must keep in mind, however, that in the rabbinic view God's love is not limited to Israel. It extends to all men: "Thy right hand is stretched forth to all those who come into the world."84 Israel is precious to God, even as a treasure is precious to a man.85 Not only is the people as a whole dear to God but every individual in Israel. When Israel stood before Mt. Sinai, God told Moses to warn the people "lest they break through. . . and many of them perish" (Ex. 19.21). The Rabbis interpret the word rab in that verse to mean that "every one of them that might be taken away is of as great account to Me as the whole אח — 221 ,81י. ™ III, 139 — אוהבים. 801, 216 — עדת קדושים. 81 III, 138 — עבדים; ibid., 23 — מקום V2d עבדיי הם. 82 III, 139• 83II, 80. The passage as given both here and in Horovitz-Rabin, op. cit., p. 150, is textually corrupt, but Horovitz-Rabin calls attention to the parallel in the Mechilta de R. Simon the text of which is certainly iriore reasonable. The terms of endearment, however, remain the same. 84II, 39• 8* II, 204.</page><page sequence="17">[17] RABBINIC CONCEPT OF ISRAEL 73 work of creation."86 God's profound love, tender and personal, as felt by the Rabbis, is here portrayed in the strongest manner possible. Israel is God's especially beloved people. God is "The Lord, the God of all flesh" (Jer. 32.27), the Rabbis point out, but add with emphasis that "He associated His name particularly with Israel."87 "I am God for all those who come into the world, nevertheless I have associated My name particularly with My people Israel."88 "The whole world is Thine, and yet Thou hast no other people than Israel," say the Rabbis, offering sound proof from the Bible.85 Israel is designated as God's "possession" and as God's "inheritance," sharing that distinction only with the Land of Israel, the Temple and the Torah, things which are themselves bound up with Israel.50 Of special significance is the word "nevertheless" (אף על פי כן) which occurs in one of the passages just quoted. It indicates that, although the Rabbis rec ognized the anomaly of the God of the universe making one particular people for His own, this anomaly was to them only astounding evidence of God's love for Israel. The exalted place of Israel was both deserved and established in the very nature of the universe. It was deserved: "He has proclaimed me of spe cial distinction and I (Israel) have proclaimed Him of special distinction."51 And it has been ordained from the beginning: "Have they not already from the time of the six days of creation been designated to be before Me? For it says, 'If these ordinances depart from before Me, saith the Lord, then the seed of Israel 86II, 225. The biblical proof-text is "For the Lord's is the eye of man and all the tribes of Israel" (Zech. 9.1), "the eye of man" apparently being taken to mean the world in general which man sees. 8' III, 184 — ייחד שמו ביותר. u Ibid.,u Ibid., 185. 89II, 69, 75. The proof-texts are: "The people that Thou hast redeemed" (Ex. 15.13), "The people that Thou hast gotten" (Ex. 15.16), "The people which I formed for Myself" (Isa. 43.21). "But were they not God's people?"— II, 4; the proof-text here is: "Yet they are Thy people and Thine inheritance" (Deut. 9.29). '0II, 75-6, 77-8. " II, 23.</page><page sequence="18">74 MAX KADUSHIN [18j also shall cease from being a nation before Me forever' (Jer. 31. 35)■"'2 God identifies Himself with Israel, in a sense. Israel's troubles, are as it were, His troubles and their joys His joys.93 So strongly did the Rabbis feel God's close sympathy with Israel that, on the basis of it, they not only reinterpret but actually reconstruct a biblical text. R. Judah declares, though with circumspection, that Zech. 2.12 originally read: "Surely he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of Mine eye."'4 Israel's enemies are thus God's enemies. "And who are they that rose up against Thee? They that rose up against Thy children."95 And the midrash goes on to say that as to him who helps Israel it is as though "he helps Him who spake and the world came to be."96 In these mid rashim the Rabbis ascribe to God attitudes which they also ascribe to Shekinah. The same is true of many of the deeds in behalf of Israel depicted in the following paragraphs. God, in His loving-kindness, protects and helps Israel. To portray this phase of God's love, the Rabbis tell a parable of a man who was walking in the way with his son in front of him. Let robbers, who seek to capture the lad, attack in front, the father acts as shield by placing the son behind him; let a wolf attack from behind, the father again acts as shield by placing the lad once more before him; let robbers attack in front and wolves behind, the father takes the son up in his arms.97 Repeated in another section, this parable is introduced there with the fol lowing poignant image: " 'And how I bore you on eagles' wings' (Ex. 19.4) — How is the eagle distinguished from all other birds? The rest of the birds carry their young between their feet, being גי I, 222; compare also the statement 01' R. Simon the son of Yohai, ibid., 217-18. « II, 160. 94 II, 43. See Lauterbach, ibid., note #1. R. Judah employs circumlocu tion so as not to make the actual change in text. The change from the original reading would be out of regard for the majesty of God, not because of fear of anthropomorphism. "I have no doubt that עיני was the original reading."—L. G. « II, 42, 45. '6II, 45• « I, 224-5.</page><page sequence="19">[19] RABBINIC CONCEPT OF ISRAEL 75 afraid of other birds flying higher above them. The eagle, how ever, is afraid only of men who might shoot at him. His intention, therefore, is to let (the arrow) lodge in him rather than in his children."98 God indeed protects Israel and always fights for them against their enemies.99 Israel's troubles are manifold and "later troubles cause the former ones to be forgotten," but God delivers them from all evil.100 He caused the sea to be divided before them, declaring on that occasion, "I am a Brother to Israel when they are in trouble."101 Not only did He cause them to pass over the sea but in the same way over the Jordan and also, apparently, over the rivers of Arnon.102 He led them un harmed through such places as the Wilderness of Kub, a long and dreadful territory, full of serpents and scorpions.103 "You call in secret and I answer you in the open and cause the whole world to be shaken on your account."101' The Bible speaks of "the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night" (Ex. 13.22), by means of which God led Israel in the Wilderness. The pillar of fire began to gleam, say the Rab bis, while the pillar of cloud was still there.105 More frequently the Rabbis refer to the biblical "pillar of cloud" by their term "clouds of glory." Thus the idea of Sukkot, which may be taken to mean "canopies," suggests to R. Akiba "the clouds of glory."106 The "clouds of glory" literally enveloped and protected Israel: There were four on the four sides of them, one above and one beneath them, "and one that advanced before them, raising the »' II, 202—3.

According to this statement, there were seven "clouds of glory;" another opinion sets them at thirteen, still another at four and still another at two.107 God's protection of Israel in this wise presents to the Rabbis an anomaly similar to the one we noticed above, and once more because of their recognition of the universality of God. " 'And the Lord went before them by day' etc. (Ex. 13.21) — Is it possible to say so? Has it not already been said, 'Do I not fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord' (Jer. 23.24)?" The answer here, too, is that this anomaly is but astounding evidence of God's love for Israel, an answer illus trated by the parable of Antoninus himself lighting the way for his sons although the courtiers, the great men of the Empire, expressed their eagerness to do so.108 God is the Redeemer of Israel. He redeemed them from the bondage of Egypt. "Through the strength (of God) did Israel go out of Egypt."10» The Exodus could not have taken place save for direct divine intervention; never had a slave, it was said, been able to run away from Egypt, yet on this occasion God brought out six hundred thousand people.110 The final redemption of Israel "from the hand of Egypt" resembled the escape of a bird from out of a man's hand when only a slight pressure could have choked the bird, and the drawing out of a new-born calf from a cow's womb.111 Indeed the deliverance from Egypt "is equal to all the miracles and mighty deeds which God has done for Israel."1" God's love for Israel was also manifest in the details and circumstances of the redemption.

While Israel was in Egypt, a woman would give birth to six children at one delivery,"5 no doubt to offset the cruel decimation of Israel by the Egyptians. And God encouraged the people at the brink of the redemption by announcing the good tidings that "they were destined to see children and children's children.""6 According to one authority, "God skipped over the houses of his children in Egypt" (when the last plague was visited upon Egypt),Egypt), and this action was a further manifestation of His love — "Hark! my Beloved! behold, He cometh leaping upon the mountains . . . behold, He standeth behind our wall," etc. (Song of Songs 2.87".(9־ God is the salvation of Israel.

Nahmanides uses this example among a number of others to prove this very point; and he insists that it is true not only of rabbinic but also of biblical times for, although all of his examples are rabbinic, he brings them as proof that the עוים (Deut. 2.23) were the חוים.

"י Ibid.</page><page sequence="22">78 MAX KADUSHIN [22] The universality of God's love and His especial concern with Israel are once more linked by the Rabbis when depicting God's providence. "Thou àrt Helper and Supporter of all who come into the world but of me (Israel) especially."120 In that parable referred to above wherein the father protects his son with his own body, the father also attends to each of the lad's needs. When the lad begins to suffer from the sun, his father spreads his cloak over him; when the lad is hungry, he feeds him, thirsty, he gives him to drink. "So, (too), did the Holy One blessed be He do (to Israel) "He spread a cloud for a screen" (Ps. 105.39) &gt; He fed them bread (Ex. 16.4) ; He gave them water to drink (Ps. 78.16).121 After the many years of servitude, the Israelites did not leave Egypt empty-handed, but "the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians" (Ex. 12.36). The Rabbis offer various comments on this verse, all of them illustrating the willingness of the Egyptians to part with their gold and silver and raiment; in fact, according to one comment, the Egyptians let them have things for which they did not even ask.122 "There was not a.single Israelite," says another authority, "who did not bring up with him (from Egypt) ninety asses laden with gold and silver."123 The "plunder" at the Red Sea was, however, even greater than that taken out of Egypt.124 After leaving Egypt, God provided Israel with food and drink during their long so journ in the Wilderness. "On the day the Holy One blessed be He created His world He created there (at Elim) twelve springs, corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel, and seventy palm trees, corresponding to the seventy elders."125 He gave them the manna because of His love, not because it was due them.126 He brought Israel not by the straight road in order that the Canaa 120II, 23• 1211, 225. 1221, 105-6. "With great substance" (Gen. 15.4) — God's promise to Abraham — is interpreted to mean "I will fill them with silver and gold" (I, 109). 12ג II, 139. 12" I, 106. 2« II, 98. 226 II, 102.</page><page sequence="23">[23] RABBINIC CONCEPT OF ISRAEL 79 nites might arise and repair all the damage they had done to the seeds, trees, buildings and wells upon hearing that Israel was about to enter the land; and thus Israel came not "to a desolate land but to a land full of all good things."127 And when He brought them to the Land, He gave each tribe its proper place and portion so that Israel was "like a vineyard that is planted in rows."128 God's love for Israel is also manifested in the moral sphere. "Thou hast shown us loving-kindness (חסד) for we possessed no (meritorious) deeds . . . And the world from its very begin ning was created only by loving-kindness."12' Here, it is worth noticing, though God's universal love and Israel are again linked, there is no greater emphasis on Israel than on "the world" in general. God's mercy alone enabled Israel to leave Egypt, not their own virtue. "They were rebellious but He dealt with them charitably."1'0 He exercised His mercy and forgave them when they repented after having angered Him — this both at Rephi dim and in the Wilderness of Sinai.1'1 God's love is enduring and compassionate, and needs must be in the face of human frailty and weakness. It was revealed before Him that they would deal falsely with Him in the future; "yet He helped them — was their Saviour — not as people who would in the future provoke Him but as people who would never prove faithless to Him."1'2 In this section, we have described, to some degree, how the concept of God's loving-kindness intertwines with the concept of Israel. God loves Israel, and Israel is precious to Him. Israel is God's especially beloved people and He identifies Himself, in a sense, with that people. He protects and helps Israel and is the Redeemer of Israel. His providence sustains them. His mercy and forgiveness never fail them. These aspects of God's love for "71, 171-2. 128II, 77• The ark was a means of blessing, of invoking God's providence, the Rab bis emphasize, not as the people were wont to say, after the incidents of Uzzah and the men of Beth-Shemesh, a means of punishment — II, 132.

When we shall take up combinations of three or more concepts, there will emerge a somewhat fuller description of these as well as of other aspects of God's love for Israel. We have, hence, thus far not told the complete story. It is important to bear this in mind when evaluating the effect upon the national consciousness of linking the universality of God with His special relation to the people of Israel. The people felt that Israel alone, in a largely pagan world, were the bearers of the Word of God; God's special relation to Israel was therefore vin dicated both by the Bible and by their own experience. This view, moreover, gave them stregnth to withstand the buffeting and persecution which was so often their lot. Nevertheless, had this view not been checked, continuously, by other elements in the organic complex, it would doubtless have led to arrant chauvin ism. One of these checks was the concept of God's justice. Its interplay with the concept of Israel is the theme of the following section. IV. God's Justice1" and Israel The justice of God, like His loving-kindness, is universal in scope.134־ It is manifested toward Israel, as toward all nations and individuals, both in reward and in punishment. Thus, if the people of Israel act according to the will of God, they are re warded; if not, they are punished. When they do God's will, "they make His left hand to be like a right hand" (a symbol for strength and protection), but when they do not, "they make His right hand to be like a left" (a symbol for withdrawal of protection); when they do God's will, "there is no sleep before Him, as it says 'Behold, He that keepeth Israel doth neither slumber nor sleep' (Ps. 121.4)," but when they do not, "there is, as it were, sleep before Him, as it says 'Then the Lord awaked 1מדת הדיןגג — II, 28. For this term, cf. TE, pp. 163-6. See TE, Chap. VI, for an analysis of the concepts of God's justice.</page><page sequence="25">[25] RABBINIC CONCEPT OF ISRAEL 81 as one asleep' (Ps. 78.65);" when they do God's will, "there is no anger before Him," but when they do not, "there is, as it were, anger before Him;" and when they do God's will, "He fights for them," but when they do not, "He fights against them, — and not that alone but they even make the Merciful One cruel."1" Here God's protection of Israel is associated with His justice, whereas in the preceding section we saw that it was integrated with God's love. We can begin to perceive, therefore, how the organic quality of rabbinic thought acts as a check upon any development of complacent nationalism. For in this midrash the national welfare is made dependent upon Israel's acting according to the will of God, and on that alone. God's justice decides Israel's economic welfare; national pros perity depends upon Israel's "doing God's will." When Israel do God's will, says R. Ishmael, they have to observe only the Sabbatical year required by the law (Ex. 23.10-11 and Lev. 25. 2-4), but when they do not, adverse conditions force upon them four such "Sabbatical" years in a septennate.136 Another midrash has it that ease, or freedom from work, apparently regarded a symbol of national prosperity, is Israel's reward for doing God's will, and exploitation by others Israel's punishment for not doing it. "When Israel do God's will. . . their work is done for them by others . . . but when Israel do not God's will. . . they themselves must do their own work, and not only that but even the work of others is done by them, as it is said, 'Thou shalt serve thine enemy' (Deut. 28.48)."137 Now above we saw that national pros perity — food, shelter, riches — was a gift of God's love, a mani festation of His providence. Here we find it to be contingent upon Israel's deeds and a manifestation of God's justice. We thus have 13י II, 4!2־• The terms לפניו, "before Him," and כביכול, "as it were," mitigate the anthropomorphisms. But we ought to notice that the anthro pomorphism of right and left hand is not so mitigated, and that כביכול is em ployed here to soften only the anthropomorphisms expressing punishment. See the remarks on the use of these precautionary terms in OT, p. 217. These terms, as we have pointed out there, do not imply a philosophic approach to God. 136 III, 173. 1לג III, 202 and 206-7. There is a slight difference between the two versions.</page><page sequence="26">[26] 82 MAX KADUSHIN another example of that "inconsistency"— more properly, that flexibility — to which attention was called in the preceding para graph. Matters interpreted by means of the concept of God's love could be — and also were — interpreted by means of the concept of God's justice. This check upon the development of a complacent nationalism is, therefore, not sporadic but inherent in the organic nature of rabbinic thought. Reward is promised Israel for moral sensitiveness and punish ment for the lack of it. " 'And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord, and all the ordinances' (Ex. 24.3) — he told them: If you will accept with joy the stipulated penalties, you will obtain reward ; but if not, you receive punishment. And they accepted with joy the stipulated penalties."158 This passage does have■ for its subject moral sensitiveness, despite the threat involved. Joy cannot be coerced. The term employed in the midrash above for reward is sakar and for punishment puranut.15« More often these sub-concepts are referred to as midat ha-tovah and midat ha-puranut.14° God rewards Israel as a people, and the tribes individually, for doing His will or for exhibiting zeal. Regarding Ex. 15.1 — "The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea"—- the Rabbis ask, "But was there only one horse and one rider?" And they answer, "When Israel do the will of God, their enemies are before them as but one horse and one rider."141 On that same memorable occasion at the Red sea, but before the waters were divided, the tribes wrangled with one another in their zeal to be the first to enter the sea, each one saying, "I will go down into the sea first." The tribe of Benjamin did not wait for a deci sion, however, but jumped into the sea first, whereupon the princes of Judah, in sore disappointment, began hurling stones at them. Since it was nought but zeal for God that caused this '38 II, 208-9• II, 209 — שכר and פורענות. 140 Cf., e. g., I, 55, 103 — מרת הטובה and פורענות" .מדת הפורענות is a neutral term: the payment one receives for his deeds — reward for the good and pun ishment for the evil."— L. G. Nevertheless, in all the instances to be found in this text, puranut carries with it always the connotation of punishment. 141II, 19.</page><page sequence="27">[27] RABBINIC CONCEPT OF ISRAEL 83 quarrel, both tribes were rewarded: The Shekinah (referring here to the Divine Presence in the Temple in Jerusalem) rested in the portion of the tribe of Benjamin, and royalty (referring to David and his dynasty) was given the tribe of Judah for its merit.142 God's justice is visited upon Israel not only in reward but also, and apparently more frequently, in punishment. And the Rabbis discern the manifestation of God's punitive justice in the times close to them and in the events of their own day no less than in the distant past of Israel, as we shall soon learn. Being a commentary on a portion of the Book of Exodus, our Midrash depicts God's punishment of Israel whilst they were in Egypt and in the Wilderness. Even according to a conservative opinion, only one out of five Israelites went out of Egypt, the rest being slain by God during the Three Days of Darkness.143 Because "the sons of Ephraim" took matters in their own hand and went forth out of Egypt without waiting for "the end"— that is, the time set by God — the Philistines were enabled to slay them all, two hundred thousand strong.144 Before the Red Sea was divided, Israel were placed in judgment as to whether or no they should be destroyed together with the Egyptians.145 There is certainly a suggestion here that Israel were not without guilt, perhaps only less so than the Egyptians. Israel and the Egyptians are not on totally different planes. Indeed, one of the punishments meted out to the Egyptians was later to be visited on Israel as well.

They had asked for bread and it was granted them, since it is not possible for man to live without bread. "But now you turn around," God tells Moses to say to Israel, "and, out of a full stomach, you ask for meat. Behold, I shall give it to you. . . But though I am giving it to you, I shall later punish you. 'And ye shall know that I am the Lord your God' (Ex. 16.12) — I am a judge to exact punishment of you."147 According to some authorities, Amalek's attack upon Israel was a punishment for the ingratitude of Israel: "Let Amalek the ungrateful come and punish the people who were ungrateful."148 It would seem, how ever, that the severest penalty of all was meted out to Israel for the sin of making the golden calf, for the penalty consisted of a permanent change in the status of the mass of the people. Before they made the golden calf, the entire people were designated as 'a holy nation" (Ex. 19.6). This leads the Rabbis to say, "(The whole people of) Israel, before they made the (golden) calf, were eligible to eat of the holy things; but after they made the (golden) calf these were taken from them and given to the priests (exclu sively)."145 There was thus, originally, no distinction between 14י II, 107-8. "Your God" is a form of Elohim. See above, note 145. We are thus confirmed in our statement that the passage to which that note refers, I, 225-6, implies guilt on Israel's part. R. Eleazar of Modi'im interprets the phrase "Come near" (Ex. 16.9) to refer to the incident of the quail and to mean, "Come near, to give account" — II, 106. 148II, 137. 145II, 205. I had thought to question Lauterbach's interpretation of להיות לו בנים כיוצאי מצרים. "The commentators whom Lauterbach follows are quite correct in interpreting כיוצאי מצרים as referring to the large number and not to their holy character. Not only has Midrash Tehillim XLV, end, explicitly explained ביוצאי מצרים by ששים רבוא (comp. also Tanljuma, Toledot 9), but the remark in the Mekilta יכול דווים וסגופים has no sense if כיוצאי מצרים means holy, as they — holy people — are not 'wretched and afflicted.' It is, however, possible that in the Mekilta the meaning is: as many children as were procre ated by those who went out of Egypt — and not, as understood by the later Midrashim, as many (600,000) as those who left Egypt.

The demarcation between priests and people, with the reduction in status for the mass which this en tailed, came only as penalty for the sin of making the golden calf.150 But God's punitive justice is manifest throughout Israel's history, not alone in the remote past. The Rabbis find occasion, even in this commentary on the Book of Exodus, to interpret later events and those of their own day in the light of God's uni versai justice. Three things—the Land of Israel, the Temple, and the kingship of the House of David — were given condi tionally, they assert, and were taken away when the conditions, consisting of loyalty to God and His commandments, were not fulfilled.151 All the disasters that came upon Israel were justified, according to the Rabbis, were, in fact, punishments inflicted by God. He punished the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, they say, apparently referring to the First Exile, and he also punished the Ten Tribes, scattering them abroad.152 Israel's wickedness brought about the destruction of the Temple, so that they were obliged to count from its destruction instead of from its construe tion; it likewise brought about foreign domination, so that they were obliged to count according to the era of others instead of their own.155 Interpretations in like vein gave significance to the tragic circumstances of the Rabbis' own times. In a passage fol lowing immediately upon the one last cited, we are told of how R. Joljanan ben Zakkai once justified Israel's dire poverty and their degrading servitude to Rome and to other, inferior, nations. 1s» "The rabbinic concept of Israel widens the biblical ideal of Israel as a priest-people until the demarcation between the priest-class and the rest of Israel is all but eliminated"—OT, p. 222. See ibid, for other examples. The rabbinic concepts, as that section demonstrates, are much wider in appli cation than their biblical antecedents. 1s1 II, 188. The conditions were, respectively, those given in Deut. 11.16 f., I Ki. 6.12 and 9.8, and Ps. 132.12 together with ibid., 89.33. IS* I, 230. The juxtaposition of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin with the scattering of the Ten Tribes leaves no doubt that the punishment of the former was the First Exile. The scattering of the Ten Tribes is adduced from the proof-text (Jer. 18.17). II, 193.</page><page sequence="30">86 MAX KADUSHIN [30] He was going up to Emmaus in Judea when he saw a Jewish girl picking barley-corn out of the excrements of a horse that, he was told, belonged to an Arab. The scene was symbolic to him of the state of all Israel, and he declared, "You are unwilling to be sub ject to Heaven (God), behold now you are subjected to the most inferior of the nations, the Arabs; you were unwilling to pay the head-tax of Heaven, 'a beka a head.' (Ex. 38.26), behold now you are paying a head-tax of fifteen shekels under a government of your enemies ; you were unwilling to repair the roads and streets leading up to the Temple, behold now you have to keep in repair the posts and stations on the roads to the royal cities." God's stern justice is further emphasized by the close of the passage in a lesson drawn from Deut. 28.47-48: " 'Because thou dist not serve the Lord thy God' with love, 'therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy' with hatred ; 'because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God' when thou hadst plenty, 'therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy' 'in hunger and in thirst'; 'because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God' when thou wast well-clothed,,'therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy' 'in nakedness' ; 'because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God' by reason of the abundance Of all things: 'therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy' 'in want of all things.' "IS4 The Rabbis thus attribute the general state of Israel to God's punitive justice. Nor do they refrain from interpreting by means of the same concept specific national catastrophes of their own day, such as the disastrous revolt under Trajan.153 God punishes Israel for the sins committed by the nation as a whole. The concept of God's justice also includes, however, the aspect of corporate justice whereby the whole group is held ac countable, and therefore punished, for the sins of the individual.156 This aspect of God's justice, the Rabbis feel, is applied in all its rigorousness especially to the people of Israel: " 'A nation one ■si II, 193-5. '55 I, 213-14. Other things mentioned here are trafficking with Egypt dur ing the period of Sennacherib and in the days of Joljanan the son of Kareah. For the revolt under Trajan, see the references given by Horovitz-Rabin, p. 95. 1s6 For corporate justice, see OT, pp. 10-ll,and TE, pp. 179-184. The group, conversely, is also rewarded for the good deeds performed by the individual.</page><page sequence="31">[31] RABBINIC CONCEPT OF ISRAEL 87 in the earth' (I Chron. 17.21) — One of them commits a sin and all of them are punished."157 The concept of God's justice interweaves with the concept of Israel. The people of Israel are rewarded or punished, accord ing as they do God's will. Moral sensitiveness and zeal are re warded. But the history of Israel, as the Rabbis view it, is replete with instances of God's punitive justice. Moreover, the Rabbis interpret numerous events and circumstances of their own day as so many punishments for wrong-doing on the part of Israel. Indeed, the more rigorous application of God's punitive justice is particularly the burden of Israel. Thus interwoven with the concept of God's justice, the concept of Israel could not have made, with any degree of consistency, for a complacent national ism. This interplay of concepts demonstrates, in other words, how the element of universality acts as a check upon the element of nationality whilst both are given simultaneous expression. V. Integration of the Fundamental Concepts The fundamental concepts interweave with one another, as has been demonstrated in the sections above. But this intégra tion is even more thorough-going than we have as yet had the opportunity to perceive. We have noticed, thus far, how any one fundamental concept can combine with any other, the funda mental concepts in any combination being only two. Frequently, however, three fundamental concepts are interlaced with each other in a single passage, and sometimes even all four. God's love, His justice, and Israel are the fundamental con cepts woven together in each of the midrashim now to be consid ered. The Rabbis interpret the words "My God (Eli) . . . my father's God" (Ex. 15.2) to mean that Israel declared, "With me He dealt according to the rule (or quality) of mercy, while with my fathers He dealt according to the rule (or quality) of 1" II, 205-6. The text here is obviously corrupt, although the sentence ],אחד מהן חוטא וכולן נענש is clear enough. Lauterbach is forced into an ambig uous translation by the rest of the text as given here. I have taken the passage as it occurs in Mechilla de Rabbi Simon, ed. Hoffman, p. 95, which offers no difficulty.</page><page sequence="32">88 MAX KADUSHIN [32] justice."158 In this interpretation of a verse from the song at the Red Sea, the people of Israel give thanks to God and contrast God's mercy toward themselves, undeserved and thus simply a manifestation of His loving-kindness, with God's strict justice toward their ancestors.159 God, out of His love, provided Israel with manna during the period of the Wilderness; but, though He also gave them the meat for which they asked, that request was uncalled for and brought punishment. "The manna was given Israel with 'a bright countenance': the quail, because they asked for it out of a full stomach, was given them with 'a frowning countenance.' "16° The same agency employed by God on one occasion as the instrument of His punitive justice is also em ployed by Him on another occasion iri the manifestation of His love. For, unlike man, "the Holy One Blessed be He. . . heals with the very same thing with which He smites." When he exiled Israel, He exiled them by means of clouds (Lam. 2.1), and when He assembles them again, He will assemble them by means of clouds (Isa. 60.8); when He scattered them, He scattered them like doves (Ezek. 7.16), and when He brings them back, He will bring them back like doves (Isa. 60.8).ï&lt;!1 In each of these mid rashim, the fundamental concepts of God's love, His justice, and Israel are in combination. We must also mark, however, that although they combine, the individual concepts here stand out rather boldly, quite clear and distinct: God manifested His mercy toward Israel at the Red Sea whereas He acted toward their ancestors with punitive justice; God provided Israel with manna, a a manifestation of His love, and He punished them for asking for the quail, a manifestation of His justice; God exiled Israel by means of clouds and scattered them like doves, manifestations "י II, 28. The word El, as this midrash goes on to explain, always refers to God's mercy. Contrasted with El in the proof-text, according to the rab binic interpretation, is Elohim, or rather its genitive, which, as we have noticed above, note 145, stands for God's justice. "This refers to the suffering of the Patriarchs because of 'slight' sins they had committed."— L. G. 160II, 105 (twice); cf. ibid108 ". The midrash also says that Israel was justified in asking for the manna. 1611, 239-40.</page><page sequence="33">[33] RABBINIC CONCEPT OF ISRAEL 89 of His justice, and He will assemble them by means of clouds and bring them back like doves, future manifestations of His love. But the individuality of each of the fundamental concepts is not always so definite and clear-cut when the concepts are in combination. Sometimes concepts blend into one another, so thorough-going is their integration. This is true of God's love and His justice in the following midrashim, each of which again presents the fundamental concepts of God's love, His justjce, and Israel in combination. " 'Ye are standing this day all of you . . . your little ones' etc. (Deut. 29.9-10) — Now what do the little ones know about distinguishing between 'good' and 'evil' (Deut. 30.15)? It was but to give the parents reward for bringing their children, thus increasing the reward of those who do His win.62■" The people of Israel are to be given additional reward for bringing their children to the assemblage, but it was God's love that made for the inclusion of the children in the assemblage at all. Two fundamental concepts are thus mingled: God's love here makes for the occasion of the exercise of His rewarding justice. The homily concludes with a statement, immediately following on the section already quoted, that practically says this in so many words. "This confirms what has been said: 'the Lord was pleased for His love's sakç' etc. (Isa. 42.21)."163 When God issues decrees concerning Israel, says another midrash, the execution is reported back to Him if it be for good and is not reported back to Him if it be for evil.164 This distinction obviously proceeds out of God's love; again the two concepts are mingled. The promised redemption of Israel is to come at the end of four hundred years, according to one verse (Gen. 15.13). and accord ing to another {ibid., 15.16) "in the fourth generation." "How 1621, 132. Lauterbach does not in his translation hold to the text he gives — ליתן שכר בנים לאבות — which is the reading of the MSS, but offers the sense rather of the reading in the printed editions, לסביאיהם. Horovitz-Rabin prefers the latter. 16נ Ibid. We translate צדקו as "His love." The whole context is additional proof that the larger meaning of צדקה in rabbinic literature is love; cf. OT, pp: 132-3 and 303, notes 193 and 194. 16*Ibid., 11-13. Proof is given from Ezek. 9.2-7 and 11.</page><page sequence="34">90 MAX KADUSHIN [34] can both these passages be maintained?" asks Rabbi Judah the Prince. And he answers, "The Hofy One blessed be He said: If they repent I will redeem them after the number of generations, and if not, I will redeem them after the number of years."165 Israel's redemption, whenever it comes, is a manifestation of God's love, as we saw above, but the redemption will neverthe" less be hastened in reward for repentance. Thus once more the concepts of God's love and His justice are mingled. Another combination of fundamental concepts consists of God's love, Torah, and Israel. At Sinai, when the Ten Command ments were given, "God came forth to receive Israel as a bride־ groom comes forth to meet the bride."166 God spoke to Israel at that time, according to the Rabbis, in the tender phrases of the Song of Songs: "Let me hear thy voice" (Song of Songs 2.14) that is, when responding to the Ten Commandments; "for sweet is thy voice" {ibid.) — after having received the Ten Command ments; "and thy countenance is comely" {ibid.) — when "all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord" (Lev. 9.5).167 There was a purpose to the revelation which again indi cates God's love for Israel — "God has come in order to make you (Israel) great among the Nations."168 This combination of God's love, Torah, and Israel does not always make for interpretations which glorify Israel. When Israel stood at Sinai, they sought to deceive God by saying "All that the Lord hath spoken we will do and obey" (Ex. 24.7), and God was silent and forgave them. " 'They beguiled Him. . . for their heart was not steadfast with Him' (Ps. 78.36-7) and yet 'He, being full of compassion, forgiveth iniquity' etc. {ibid., 78.38)."16' Here God's love is stressed as it manifests itself in forgiveness of Israel's iniquity. Another midrash contrasts God's love for Israel, expressed in various ways, with Israel's utter ingratitude, demonstrated in their refusal to obey the laws.

Perhaps you will say that I have imposed upon you many commandments. I have imposed upon you the observance of this (commandment of the) Sabbath since Marah, and you have not kept it."170 The combination of God's justice, Torah, and Israel occurs frequently, God's justice having the aspects of reward and pun ishment, and Torah the aspect of mizwot, or conduct, and study. The great deeds done in Israel's behalf by God were deserved, and were rewards for the observance of definite mizwot. When the first-born of Egypt were slain, the people of Israel were spared. R. Ishmael declares that they were spared "in reward for the mizwah"mizwah" performed when they struck the lintel and the two side posts with the blood, as they had been commanded to do.171 Until the last Israelite had finished his paschal sacrifice, R. Jose the Galilean says, the whole people were in danger of being destroyed in Egypt;172 the observance of this commandment, then, saved Israel. For adhering to the rite of circumcision, according to one opinion, God brought Israel out of Egypt;173 according to another, that adherence earned for them the division of the Red Sea.17'' Various other reasons, however, are also assigned for the divi sion of the Red Sea, among them Israel's observance of the mezu zahzah and of the tefillin.17s And Israel received not only physical but spiritual rewards, as well, for observing mizwot. Moses told Israel, says R. Joshua, that if they would succeed in keeping the 170 II, 121. 1711, 56, 87.

On p. 247, another reason given is Israel's future acceptance of the Torah and Israel's prayer. "The assumption is that Israel observed the commandments before they were revealed on Sinai"— L. G.</page><page sequence="36">92 MAX KADUSHIN [36] Sabbath, God would give them the festivals of Pesah, Shabuot and Sukkot, whilst according to R. Eleazar of Modi'im, the re ward will consist of six good portions— the Land of Israel, the World to Come, the "New World," the kingdom of the House of David, the priesthood, and the Levites' offices.176 Anything for which Israel laid down their lives — for example, the Sabbath, circumcision, the study of Torah and the ritual of immersion — was preserved among them; but anything for which they did not lay down their lives — for example, the Temple, civil courts, the Sabbatical and jubilee years — was not preserved among them.177 In this paragraph, we have seen that the Rabbis inter preted the events in Egypt and on the Red Sea by means of the concepts of God's justice, Torah, and Israel whereas previously we noticed that they interpreted the same events by means of the concepts of God's love and Israel. God rewards Israel when they study Torah. "The words of the Torah which I have given you are life unto you. . . they are health unto you."178 The prophet Jeremiah conveyed to his gen eration a similar idea by using as a reminder the jar of manna, kept since the days of the Wilderness. Jeremiah had rebuked Israel for not occupying themselves with Torah, and the people had replied, "If we occupy ourselves with the words of the Torah, how will we get our sustenance?" Jeremiah thereupon brought forth the jar of manna, saying, "See with what your forefathers, who occupied themselves with the words of the Torah, were pro vided! You, too, if you will occupy yourselves with the words of the Torah — God will provide you, too, with sustenance of this sort."17' 176 II, 119-20, 122. As to the term the "New World": "Comp. Isa. 66.22 הארץ החדשה, and hence עולם חדש."—l. g. 177177 III, 204-5. See Lauterbach, ibid., note #8. In view of the heroic de fense of the Temple, it is curious that this institution was looked upon by the Rabbis as one for which Israel did not lay down their lives. "The reference is to Israel's sacrifices at the time of שמד — comp. Shabbat 130a: בשעת גוירת המלכות; and after the destruction of the Temple only one serious attempt was made to reestablish the Temple."— l. g. 178II, 96. . "» II, 125-6.</page><page sequence="37">[37] RABBINIC CONCEPT OF ISRAEL 93 God also punishes Israel for not studying Torah or for not observing mizwot. "Is it possible for the rush to grow without mire and without water? ... So also is it impossible for Israel to exist unless they occupy themselves with words of Torah. And because they separated themselves from words of Torah, the enemy came upon them, for the enemy comes only because of sin and transgression; therefore it says, 'Then came Amalek,' (Ex. 17.8)."18° The attack by Amalek is but one instance of the general rule that "the enemy comes (upon Israel) only because of (their) relinquishing their hold on the Torah."181 Another in stance given is the attack by Shishak, king of Egypt (I Ki. 14. 25-26), for at that time Rehoboam "forsook the law of the Lord and Israel with him" (II Chron. 12.1).182 Some authorities, hold ing that "And he feared not God" (Deut. 25.18) refers not to Amalek but to Israel, interpret that verse to "mean that Amalek's attack was a punishment for Israel's lack of mizwot.183 The gen eral idea that the enemy comes upon Israel because of Israel's deficiency in Torah is here made more specific by the depiction of Israel as lacking in mizwot, as deficient in conduct. The same general idea is also made more specific by describing the defi ciency in Torah as deficiency in study. " 'Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy ... in want of all things' (Deut. 28.48) — 'in want of all things': They were deficient in the study of Torah."184 God's justice in its aspect of corporate justice combines with the concepts of Torah and Israel. We learned above that this 180II, 135• Similarly, ibid., 139, 129. See the following note. 1Sr II, 139. The general rule is drawn from the word רפידים, the name of the place where Amalek attacked Israel. The Rabbis interpret the word רפידים to be רפיון ידים, which Lauterbach wrongly translates as "feebleness of hands." This rabbinic interpretation is implied on II, 135, though it is not given there. The full derashah can be seen from the parallel on II, 129, where the verse is given, "And . . . Israel journeyed from the Wilderness of Sin . .. and encamped in Rephidim" (Ex. 17.9). The Rabbis take "Sin" to be Sinai, thus Torah, and the verse is given the meaning that they left the Torah, and this meaning is corroborated, according to them, by the phrase "encamped at Rephidim," which is taken to be רפיון ידים. 188 II, 139• 188II, 136. 184II, 195.</page><page sequence="38">[38] 94 MAX KADUSHIN aspect of God's justice, the Rabbis felt, is applied in all its rigor ousness especially to the people of Israel. When the people stood before Mt. Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments, had one person defied the warning not to "break through unto the Lord" (Ex. 19.21) he would have brought disaster upon all. "This teaches that even one individual can impair the whole group."18s Cor porate justice, however, is not necessarily punitive in its char acter for it also underlies concepts of corporate reward. The two aspects of God's justice — reward and punishment — are occasionally found both together in combination with the concepts of Torah and Israel. "Israel stood up before Mt. Sinai," says R. Jose, "on condition that the Angel of Death should have no power over them— 'I said: Ye are godlike beings,' etc. (Ps. 82.6). (But) you corrupted your conduct— 'Surely ye shall die like men' (ibid., 82.7)."186 As reward for accepting the Torah, this midrash states, Israel was to be granted eternal life, but their conduct later was so corrupt that it brought upon them the pun ishment of death. Similarly, the observance of the mizwah of the mezuzahmezuzah should have prevented "the destroyer" (i. e., death) from entering their homes; "but what caused it to be otherwise? Our sins."187 The reward for the observance of this mizwah was to have been eternal life; the punishment meted out instead, in view of the actual sins committed, was death. Early death is the punishment with which the husbands and fathers in Israel are threatened when they violate justice, and longevity is to be their reward when they execute it. "If for merely refraining from violating justice your reward will be that your wives will not become widows and your children will not be fatherless, how much more so when you actually execute justice. . . your days will will be lengthened in this world and you will live to see children and grandchildren and you will merit the life of the World to Come."188 185 II, 225• The text offers difficulties. See Horovitz-Rabin, p. 217. 186II, 272. "Ye are godlike beings" means that like the angels Israel would have been immortal. 18ל I, 88-9. 188 III, 144-6.</page><page sequence="39">[39] RABBINIC CONCEPT OF ISRAEL 95 All four fundamental concepts are sometimes combined, inex tricably interwoven in a single midrash. When this occurs, the concepts of God's love and His justice usually flow into each other, blend, as in the following instances. Why did Scripture require that Israel purchase the paschal lamb four days prior to its slaughtering? Because, says one authority, the time had arrived, in accordance with God's oath to Abraham, for Israel's redemption, yet they were without mizwot by virtue of which they might be redeemed from Egypt. "The Holy One blessed be He therefore gave them two mizwot — the mizwah of the paschal sacrifice and the miçwah of circumcision — which they should perform that they might be redeemed. . . For one cannot obtain reward except for the deed."189 The granting of the mizwot (Torah) necessary for Israel's redemption was a manifestation of God's love toward Israel, for the redemption itself could only be in reward for the performance of mizwot, a manifestation of God's justice. All the four fundamental concepts are present here but there is a blending of the concepts of God's love and His justice. Again, because of God's love, reward for mizwot, which is a manifestation of His justice, at times precedes actual per formance by Israel of these mizwot. "Even before I (God) gave them the mizwot I advanced them the rewards for them (i. e., for the mizwot)." Thus, before Israel observed the Sabbath, they received a double portion of manna on the day preceding; and before the Sabbatical year, the sixth year was blessed; and " 'He gave them the lands of the nations' (Ps. 105.44) — what for? 'That they might keep His statutes and observe His laws' {ibid., 105.45). 105.45)."19° In this midrash, God's love and His justice blend once more, whilst the other two fundamental concepts also figure. A third instance involves the aspect, or sub-concept, of corporate justice. According to an anonymous opinion, Israel would have 185 If 33~4• The verse from which the interpretation is drawn is Ezek. 16.8. 190II, 199. The emphatic note in this passage is God's loving-kindness to Israel, all the instances cited demonstrating how God advanced His reward for the mizwot before Israel performed them. Now this passage is introduced by the biblical verse אני די דובר צדק וכוי (Isa. 459!')• We have here, therefore, another proof that zedakah has the connotation of love in rabbinic theology.

Jose, it would have been sufficient had only twenty-two thousand been present.1'1 R. Jose's statement follows immediately upon the anonymous opinion, and contains a mitigation of the latter's extreme appli cation of corporate justice. The concepts involved in R. Jose's statement, then, are Torah, Israel, and God's justice as it is mitigated by God's love. The concept of Israel is thoroughly integrated with all of the other fundamental concepts. It combines with all of the other fundamental concepts, be the combination that of two, or three, or even of all four fundamental concepts. Such intertwining can only mean that the fundamental concepts act almost as a unit; indeed, two concepts, God's love and His justice, sometimes actually blend into one another. The fundamental concepts have, (herefore, the tendency to act as checks upon each other, a tend ency which allows no one concept, Israel included, to be perm anently stressed. Israel may thus be stressed on occasion within any given combination of concepts, such as God's love, Torah and Israel ; properly so, too, since it is one of the fundamental concepts. By the same token, however, it may, on other occasions, be subordinated, and this within the very same combination of concepts. The national self-consciousness acted in concert with factors, just as powerful, that were broad and universal. 1" II, 212-13• See Lauterbach, ibid., note</page></plain_text>
