INTRODUCTION The tenth season of excavations at Shahr-i Sokhta started on 27 October 2007 and continued until 26 January 2008. During this campaign, excavations continued in the Graveyard and Craftsman s areas. What follows are a series of related reports outlining the results of these excavations, including a summary of the excavations in the Graveyard, a discussion of an artificial eye discovered in one of the graves, an analysis of human teeth from the site, a review of the excavations in the Craftsmen s Zone, and an introduction to the collabora tive archaeobotanical project being undertaken. II. GRAVEYARD In the Graveyard area (see Fig. 1), a total of 12 trenches of different sizes were opened. Of these, six squares, CMW, HLC, LEI, MIE, NHG and NKP, contained no graves or cultural items. The other six, MJN, NAM, NAW, NFM, NFR and LGL, revealed a total of 54 separate graves, containing a total of 56 human skeletons and 270 grave objects. The number of graves per trench, their type and a breakdown of the number of skeletons and number of objects is shown in Table 1. The majority of the graves, 33 in all, were of bipartite type, 18 were simple pits and 2 were of catacomb form. Trenches were dug on the northern, southern and eastern parts of the graveyard, and the largest number of graves was found in the eastern section. Most of trenches of the southern section were empty. ILL Square MM 6700 (Fig. 2) This trench was 100 sq. m. and is located 60 m. from the eastern section of the central part of the graveyard. Excavations yielded 11 new graves, two simple pit graves and 9 bipartite graves (Table 2). Two graves (Nos. 6701 and 6702) were void of human skeletons and objects, while the remainder yielded 10 human skeleton and 134 grave objects. Grave no. 6704 contained two human bodies, one female and one new born. Graves 6703 and 6701, respectively with 41 and 30 grave objects, were the richest graves of this trench (Fig. 6b). Grave 6705 contained a unique object that will be discussed below (Section III). A distinctive feature of the graves in this trench was that two skeletons belonged to children and the remaining skeletons were of adult females. IL2. Square NGL.6800 (Fig. 3) This trench of 100 sq. m. is located in the north-eastern part of the central section of the graveyard (Table 3).

In the southern section only one grave was discovered, while on the northern side, there were 8 graves. None of the 9 skeletons were female, but there were four children, two males and three unidentified individuals. The condition of preser vation of the graves was very poor and most of the objects and human skeletons were fragmentary. Only 35 grave objects were found, placing the graves of this trench among the "poor" tombs, according to the standards of Shahr-i Sokhta. II. 3.

Fragments of Buff Ware and Red Ware pottery vessels were visible on the surface, and a concentration of pottery sherds was recovered in one corner of the trench, suggesting the presence of a pit. A vast number of broken vessels were also found at different depths and in different parts of the trench, but they could not be attributed to any specific tomb. Of these piles, Collection A consisted of two Buff Ware bowls; Collection B consisted of three painted Buff Ware, pear shaped beakers; and Collection C consisted of nine different vessels. A total number of 19 graves were found, 9 pits, 9 bipartite graves and one grave that was possibly the burial of a new born placed inside a pot. A total of 20 human skeletons and 62 grave objects were found. The preservation of both human skeletons and goods was poor and we were able to distinguish the gender of only 4 skeletons. Grave Nos. 7817 and 7809, respectively with 13 and 9 grave goods, are the best furnished tombs, while some of the graves, such as No. 7800, were completely void of cultural materials. S.M.S. Sajjadi.

AN ARTIFICIAL EYE FROM SHAHR-I SOKHTA GRAVE MJN. 6705 The earliest attestation of artificial eyes in the ancient Near East has long been believed to be represented by art eyes and artificial eyes found with mummies, sarcophagus lids and statues, dating back to the third-second millennia B.C. Recent excavations at Shahr i Sokhta, in the Iranian region of Sistan-Baluchistan, have produced new evidence that could question this view. The excavations carried out in square MJN (Fig. 2) revealed one grave (No. 6705) containing a well preserved skeleton of a young woman (Fig. 7). The grave is 218 cm. long, 105 cm. wide and 152-66 cm. deep, the</page><page sequence="10">316 S.M.S. SAJJADI, M. CASANOVA, L. COSTANTINI, AND K.O. LORENTZ V, ^m n Fig. 7. Plan of bipartite grave MJN 6705 showing distribution of skeletal remains and grave objects. general shape is an oval, and structurally it is of bipartite type. The skeleton is laid on a N-S axis, on its right-hand side in a crouched position, facing east. The skeleton belongs to a female of about 28-32 years of age who had a hyper-dolicocefal skull, and who at about 180 cm. is the tallest woman ever found at Shahr-i Sokhta. A total of 30 objects were found in this grave, 25 pottery vessels (Fig. 8), 1 copper/bronze mirror, 10 lapis lazuli or turquoise beads, 1 decayed mat basket and 1 small leather bag (Fig. 9). From the remains of textile fragments attached to the bones, it seems that the skeleton was wrapped in fabric. Traces of burning are evident on the ankle of the skeleton in keeping with Shahr-i Sokhta's burial customs. The skull appeared to be partially damaged on the left side and the cleaning revealed the presence of an artificial artefact inserted in the left eye socket (Fig. 10). This artefact has a diameter of c. 3 cm. and is very well preserved (Fig. 11). It is made of a lightweight material, probably derived from bitumen and animal (pig?) paste. Its surface is meticulously engraved with a pattern consisting of a central circle for the iris and silver/gold rays departing from it (Figs. 11-12a). On the surface, very tiny traces of white colour are also visible. The golden/silver lines were applied in a very thin layer over the surface and they are still remarkably visible (Fig. 12b). On either side of the half-sphere, two tiny holes have been drilled, through which a fine thread was presumably tied to keep the artefact in place (Fig. 12c). Microscopic examinations of the skull found marks left on the eye socket by the prolonged contact with the artificial eye. The socket also bore the marks of the thread, further proving that the owner of the artificial eye wore it when alive as well as in death. In addition, a very preliminary analysis suggested that the woman may have suffered from an abscess on her eyelid because of long-term contact with the artificial eye-ball as an ocular prosthesis. Chronologically, this artificial eye ball could be dated to the Phase 9 of the occupation at Shahr-i Sokhta; i.e. 3000-2900 B.C. S.M.S Sajjadi and L. Costantini (with the collaboration of M.

ACTIVITY INDUCED PATTERNS OF DENTAL ABRASION AND ANTE-MORTEM TOOTH LOSS AT THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. SHAHR-E SOKHTE (IRAN): PRELIMINARY RESULTS IV. 1. Introduction This short report has three objectives: 1) to review the current status of analyses of the Shahr-i Sokhta human skeletal remains; 2) to present new evidence on ante mortem tooth loss and activity induced dental wear at Shahr-i Sokhta (third millennium B.C.); and 3) to interpret these patterns and their implications for understanding life ways at Shahr-i Sokhta. The presentation and discussion of results is necessarily short due to space limitations. Previous studies on human skeletal remains from Shahr-i Sokhta have been published by Pardini et al.,1 Mannucci et al.,2 Macchiarelli and Passarello,3 and Foruzanfar.4 Pardini and collaborators published descriptive craniometric studies on the adult skeletal remains excavated by the Italian mission. Macchiarelli and Passarello5 began the problem oriented study of Shahr-i Sokhta human remains with their publication on palaeodemography based on the 289 individuals excavated by the Italian mission. Foruzanfar has published preliminary reports on the human skeletal remains excavated by the Iranian mission.6 This paper concentrates on problem oriented approaches to the human remains from Shahr-i Sokhta in order to throw light on health, disease, nutrition,7 and cultural practices i Pardini 1977a; 1977b; 1979-80; Pardini and Sarvari Negahban 1976; Pardini and Lombardi Pardini 1988; 1990; Lombardi Pardini and Pardini 1992. 2 Mannucci etal 1985. 3 Macchiarelli and Passarello 1988. 4 Foruzanfar 2004; Sajjadi and Foruzanfar 2001. 5 Macchiarelli and Passarello 1988. 6 Foruzanfar 2004; Sajjadi and Foruzanfar 2001. 7 Nutrition at Shahr-i Sokhta has been previously discussed by Ligabue (1977), based on data other than human remains. Analyses of human remains, including bone and hair are, however, the only direct measures of nutrition in the past.</page><page sequence="14">320 S.M.S. SAJJADI, M. CASANOVA, L. COSTANTINI, AND K.O.

The human skeletal material discussed below derives from the excavations of the Iranian mission.8 IV.2 Materials and methods A pilot study of 37 adult dentitions from the skeletal series excavated by the Iranian mission was undertaken during the study season of2006 to investigate patterns of ante-mortem tooth loss (AMTL) and dental wear. Table 8 lists the individuals included in this pilot study, and provides information on age and sex. A total of974 tooth positions were analysed. AMTL was recorded when a tooth socket showed evidence of alveolar bone absorption.9 Frequencies were calculated based on the number of tooth positions affected. Eshed et al.10 advocate the use of simple and robust methods for recording AMTL and other dental pathologies, in order to maximise sample size while minimising inter-observer error. Periodontal disease and caries are two major factors associated with AMTL in archaeological populations.11 AMTL due to periodontal disease is usually symmetrical.12 In order to investigate the patterning as to side, data by jaw, side and tooth type was produced. Tooth wear is a normal biomechanical process involving frictional contact with other teeth (dental attrition) or with food, foreign particles contained in food, or non-food items (dental abrasion). The dental abrasion patterns produced by variations in the consistency of food, food preparation methods, and grit contained in food are consistent with well documented patterns of attrition that reflect the biomechanics of mastication,13 while the dental abrasion patterns resulting from the use of teeth as "tools" (as a manipulative device, or a "third hand") or from the placement of non-food items (such as drills, pins, leather, pipes) in the oral cavity are diffuse and irregular in direction, severity and distribution.14 In order to investigate potential non alimentary use of dentition at Shahr-i Sokhta, patterns of dental abrasion were investigated macroscopically. 8 I am grateful for the director of the excavations at Shahr-i Sokhta, Dr M. Sajjadi, and my colleague Mr F. Foruzanfar for their kind invitation to join the project. I would also like to acknowledge the competent and kind assistance I have received from ICAR and ICHHO during my research visits to Iran. 9 After Eshed et al. 2006; Frayer 1989; Ortner and Putschar 1985:22-23, 28. 10 Eshed etal 2006. 11 Clarke and Hirsch 1991; Hillson 1986; Beckett and Lovell 1994; Cook 1984; Lukacs 1992. 12 Hillson 1996. 13 Lukacs and Pastor 1990: 80. 14 Blakely and Beck 1984; Schultz 1977; Lous 1970; Lukacs and Pastor 1990; Merbs 1968; 1983; Turner and Cadien 1969.</page><page sequence="16">322 S.M.S.

Percentage of AMTL by jaw and tooth type in a sample of Shahr-i Sokhta population (N=37, with 974 observable tooth positions). Instrumental methods of analysis will be applied to the material during future study seasons. Age was estimated using the pubic symphysis of the skelton and auricular surface morphology where available.15 Where these regions were not available for observation, the eruption of M3 was taken to indicate adult age. Sex was estimated using the sexual dimorphism of os coxa16 where available, and the mandible and cranium17 where the os coxa was not available for observation. IV. 3. Preliminary results Within the sample of 37 individuals studied, AMTL affects all tooth types, including the incisors and canines (Fig. 13). The AMTL rate for first, second and third molars ranges from 24-28%, while the rates for first and second premolars are 9% and 13% respectively, and for canines 5%. The AMTL rate for lateral incisors is 8% and central incisors 9%. The overall AMTL rate at Shahr-i Sokhta is 15% (N=974). In general, both maxillary and mandibular dentitions seem equally affected, although the mandibular incisors, canines and first premolars are less often lost ante-mortem than their maxillary counterparts (Fig. 14). The patterning of AMTL as to jaw and side is symmetrical (bilateral involvement) overall (Fig. 15), although the rates of AMTL for the maxillary and mandibular incisors and canines show a more uneven distribution. The dentition of skeleton IUS 4404 shows a particu larly interesting AMTL pattern, with only the mandibular lateral and central incisors lost ante-mortem, while the canines and posterior teeth are still intact. The dentition also displays an asymmetrical pattern of extreme dental wear affecting the left maxillary and right mandibular molars. The maxillary incisors have been worn unevenly, with the incisive edges acquiring differential outlines: left 12 is concave, left II convex, right II concave, right 12 convex. This dentition and others within the sample show dental abrasion that is diffuse and irregular in direction, severity and distribution.

The dental wear pattern of individual HYI 4309 (Figs. 17-18) is worth describing in more detail. The left mandibular molars (Ml and M2) have been worn down to root, with only two-thirds of the roots remaining, and the left mandibular M3 has been lost ante-mortem, while corresponding maxillary teeth still have approximately half of their crowns intact. The right mandibular II and 12 canine and premolars have been worn down to root (with only two-thirds of the roots remaining), while corresponding maxillary teeth have approximately half of their crowns still intact. The right maxillary Ml and M2 also have been worn down to root, with extreme continuous eruption (at the time of death these teeth were about to be lost). The right maxillary M3 still has some of its crown intact, as do the right mandibular molars. There is thus uneven, asymmetrical wear with differential involvement of jaws and sides of jaws. Further, the right maxillary PM1 shows a notch worn onto its mesio-labial aspect (Fig. 19). IVA. Discussion The overall AMTL rate within this Shahr-i Sokhta sample is very high: 15% of all tooth positions (N=974) are affected. Eshed et al.ls found much lower rates of AMTL in the Natufian and Neolithic populations of the Levant (3.7% and 4.5% respectively), and Lorentz19 reports an overall AMTL rate for the Chalcolithic Cypriot populations ranging between 3 to 7%. Further, the AMTL rate for incisors (9% for central incisors and 9% for lateral incisors) and canines (5%) within the Shahr-i Sokhta sample is very high when compared, for lack of closer parallels, with the Neolithic populations of Levant (between 0-1 %)20 and the Chalcolithic populations of Cyprus (0%; no involvement of incisors or canines in either maxilla or mandible).21 AMTL due to periodontal disease is usually symmetrical.22 Molars and premolars are the teeth most often affected initially (e.g. the Chalcolithic populations of Cyprus)23 Ante-mortem tooth loss at Shahr-i Sokhta is, however, often asymmetrical, and in some individuals involves only the loss of incisors and canines (rather than molars). As to caries, another common cause of AMTL, singular carious lesions are present in only very few dentitions and none of the carious lesions at this Shahr-i Sokhta sample exceed 3.5 mm. in diameter. Caries do not seem to be a major player in AMTL at Shahr-i Sokhta, 18 Eshed et al 2006. 19 Lorentz2006. 20 Eshed et al 2006. 21 See Lorentz 2006; fig. 4. 22 Hillsonl996. 23 Lorentz 2006: fig. 4.</page><page sequence="19">SISTAN AND BALUCHISTAN PROJECT 325 ^^^^^^^^Ht^B[^^^^^^^S^^||^sH^^H^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H ^ 7.

The general pattern of AMTL (Figs. 13-15) at this Shahr-i Sokhta sample cannot thus be fully explained by reference to periodontal disease or caries. The Shahr-i Sokhta sample studied contains nine individuals (31% of the 29 individuals with complete enough dentitions for assessment), including both males and females, with dental wear that is diffuse and irregular in direction, severity and distribution, and is most likely caused by activities employing the teeth as tools. Further, the attrition severity in anterior teeth compared to posterior teeth observed in the Shahr-i Sokhta population, may be attributed to the anterior teeth functioning as tools. Incisors and canine teeth more frequently serve the dual purposes of food processing and manipulation, while the function of post-canine teeth (premolars and molars) is primarily masticatory.24 Merbs25 has summarised the activities in which the anterior teeth are used as tools among the Inuit Eskimos, including grasping (use of teeth as "pliers"), crushing, holding the bit of a bow drill in the teeth preparing skins for clothing, softening boot soles, tearing sinew for thread, and extracting blubber for lamps.

LORENTZ Fig. 19. The right maxillary PM1 of individual HYI 4309, labial view. Note the notch worn onto the mesio-labial aspect of the crown, hypercementosis of the root, and calculus deposits. (Photograph by Lorentz). masticatory activities of the anterior teeth result in con siderable stress in the form of dental abrasion and chipping of enamel, fracture of anterior teeth, and a high incidence of ante-mortem tooth loss.26 The pattern of dental wear in individual HYI 4309 (described above) may relate to drawing materials diagonally through clenched teeth, over the right mandibular incisors, canine and premolars, and left mandibular molars. This wear pattern may relate to processing of fibres (hands holding material over the teeth and pulling sideways and downwards). The notch worn onto the mesio-labial aspect of the right maxillary PM1 further supports this hypothesis. When the pattern and high prevalence of AMTL at Shahr-i Sokhta is coupled with the evidence for extreme asymmetrical and irregular dental wear, it points to the use of teeth in non-alimentary activities, as tools or as "a third hand". These patterns will be explored more fully during future study seasons. IV.5. Conclusion The preliminary results of analyses of AMTL and dental wear within a sample of Shahr-e Sokhta populations indicate unusually high rates of AMTL, involving not only the posterior teeth but also incisors and canines, and asymmetrical dental wear that is diffuse and irregular in direction, severity and distribution. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the human dentition was used as a tool, a "third hand" at Shahr-i Sokhta. The varied types of craft activities attested through contextual studies of material culture at Shahr-i Sokhta would have provided multiple opportunities for long term use of the dentition as a tool. The patterns of dental abrasion and AMTL will be investigated further during future study seasons, to allow inferences on the whole skeletal population of Shahr-i Sokhta excavated to date. This is of interest in the context of exploring the location of the human body between biology and culture, shaped by both genetic and environmental factors, including culturally specific activity patterns (Lorentz in press). Other ongoing studies by the author include the study of skeletal growth at Shahr-i Sokhta, isotopic analyses of human hair (in order to make inferences on diet), and comprehensive palaeopathological analyses of the skeletal remains excavated by the Iranian mission (in collaboration with Mr Foruzanfar). The sub-adult skeletal remains from Shahr-e Sokhta have so far not received the attention they deserve. Pardini excluded all sub-adult remains from his metric and morphological analyses. Studies of sub-adult skeletal growth (correlating sub-adult longbone diaphyseal lengths with dental calcification stages) show, however, that this data can be usefully employed in making inferences about general population health.27 During the 2006 study season growth data on all the skeletally immature individuals (N=81) from Shahr-i Sokhta within the skeletal series excavated by the Iranian mission was collected. In order to provide a more com prehensive view of skeletal growth at Shahr-i Sokhta the sub-adult skeletal remains excavated by the Italian mission should also be analysed. The data collection and analyses of this material will be undertaken during future study seasons. The unique preservation status of the human remains at Shahr-e Sokhte allows for comprehen sive studies of paleopathology and nutrition.

JOINT ARCHAEOBOTANICAL PROJECT AT SHAHR-I SOKHTA The third season of the Joint Archaeobotanical Project at Shahr-i Sokhta lasted from 13 January to 3 February 2005. The National Museum of Oriental Art and the Italian Institute for Africa and the Orient (IsIAO) sponsor the project for the Italian side, and the Iranian Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization (ICHTO) for the Iranian one. The work was mainly focused on the recovery, analysis and study of plant material from the tombs excavated by the Iranian team directed and co ordinated by Dr S.M.S. Sajjadi. Members of the mission were Dr Sirio Strika, archaeoenthomologist, Dr Matteo Delle Donne, archaeobotanist, and Mr Giuseppe Lami, computer and image analysis specialist. Telespazio Company gave great support to the Italian team offering international communication facilities. V.l. Field archaeobotanical laboratory An archaeobotanical field laboratory was established at the permanent camp of the Iranian Archaeological Mission. The laboratory, equipped with one stereomicro scope with digital camera, one microscope with digital camera and four computers, received all soil samples, plant materials, textiles, charcoals, wood remains and artefacts, and any other sample for preliminary investiga tion and micro-photographical documentation. The laboratory provides both temporary and long-term storage for botanical items, and maintained a comput erised system for the tracking of all received materials. At least minimal artefact processing takes place in the laboratory, including the sorting of items by material class and provenience unit, cleaning, labelling, and packaging artefacts in appropriate protective materials, and stabilising and preserving cultural and organic materials as necessary. The analysis of artefacts and samples was decided in accordance with archaeologists, and included, but were not limited to, the following categories: seeds and other macro-remains, charcoals, woods, and textiles. V2. Seeds and other macro-remains The analysis of archaeobotanical samples was conducted by the Italian team to identify the plant resources utilised by ancient inhabitants for food, building materials, rituals, and other uses. The samples were collected both in the course of the site and graveyard excavations by Dr Sajjadi in both 2002 and 2003. The archaeobotanical samples included flotation samples and dry residue samples mainly gathered from pottery vessels and similar containers found in the tombs. The results of plant identifications thus far are based on 56 samples from tomb vessels of 18 different graves. The list of identified species includes Triticum dicoccum, Triticum compactum, Triticum aestivum, Hordeum vulgare, Lens culinaris, Vitis vinifera, Coriandrum sativum, Cuminus cyminum, Pistacia cf. atlantica/khinjuk, Lolium sp. Polygonum sp. Phalaris sp. In 6 of the vessels the plant material was partially destroyed by insects of the Dermestidae, Anoibidae and Formicidae families. Lumps of organic remains, found in tomb no. 1413 pot no. 4, tomb no. 1414 pot no. 4 and tomb no. 3200 pot no. 6, were identified as bread remains. V.3. Wood remains and artefacts One of the most important characteristics of Shahr-i Sokhta is the preservation of wood in the form of raw material and artefacts. During the past two excavation seasons more than 200 wooden objects were found, 74 of which were investigated for botanical identification. Their study was carried out in two stages, analysis and interpretation. During analysis, the taxa of wood remains were determined and spatial and temporal patterns in their distribution were sought. Taxa identifications were made on the basis of wood anatomy and were usually assignable to the genus level. During the interpretation stage, the spatial and temporal patterns were studied to gain an understanding of past wood-working techniques and environments in order to answer the sorts of questions concerning the progress of ancient knowledge and the evolution of the arboreal vegetation. The wood remains and artefacts investigated during the three weeks of work included 11 combs, 12 artefacts/objects, 10 slivers and 41 pieces of braches, the great part of which partially charred. The results of wood analysis allowed us to identify six different genus: Populus sp., Tamarix sp., Dalbergia sp., Fraxinus sp.,</page><page sequence="22">328 S.M.S. SAJJADI, M. CASANOVA, L. COSTANTINI, AND K.O. LORENTZ Pistacia sp., and Haloxilon sp. This new set of analysis improved our knowledge on the technological development of the ancient craftsmen. Very often then standard reached a high level, considering the period to which they belonged. The wooden objects show a careful selection of material, based clearly on detailed experience and skilled preparation of the wood for the given forms. VA. Textiles Like other organic artefacts, textiles decay rapidly under most environmental conditions, but the dry and salt-laden environment of the desert all around the site of Shahr-i Sokhta, in which minimal bacterial activity is present, permitted their survival. At Shahr-i Sokhta, we have been fortunate to have hundreds of surviving pieces, ranging from very decorative and coloured clothes to the plainest of fabrics. These fragmentary remnants can shed light on a broad range of archaeological questions, and they can give very important information about the people who produced and used them. A total of 50 textile remains was included in the research program. Each artefact was documented and investigated following three main lines of research: first, a general examination to recognise/classify the typologies of fabric production; second, a more detailed analysis of the structure of the textile, using a steroemicroscope, to know the threads and their production; third, a preliminary microscopic analysis to identify the raw material (fibres) used to produce the artefact. Fibre samples for scanning electron microscope (SEM) investi gation were taken during the examination of the textiles. The studies were undertaken to obtain information about fibres and their preparation, spinning, weaver's work, non-woven fabrics, needlework and dyeing. The preliminary results of the studies and analysis carried out on the textiles collection evidenced that two main binding systems (weaves) were used in the examined materials: plain weave (1/1), the simplest form of interlacing warp and weft, and the weft- or warp-faced plain (rib) weave, an important special form of plain weave. Yarns were spun both in the S- and Z- direction and examples of Z-spun warp combined with S-spun weft were found. Sheep's wool and goat hair were identified but more analysis will be done to obtain detailed information about the different types of sheep's wool. Finally, particular attention was put into the study of a single textile made with a crochet-like technique, because the contemporary presence of two wooden crochet-like hooks could represent one of the most ancient pieces of evidence of this way of textile production.

SECTOR 7, CRAFTSMEN'S ZONE During this season, the French team, Dr M. Casanova (director; University Rennes 2), Ms M. Cotty, Mr B. Mutin, Ms C. Theiller (archaeologists), Ms Z. Shirazi (archaeobotanist), Ms C. Populaire (archaeologist, surveyor), conducted its operations in Sector 7, the Western edge of the Craftsmen's Zone (Western Industrial Zone). Dr E. Fouache (geomorphologist; University Paris XII) and Dr C. Cosandey (hydrologist; CNRS) began a preliminary investigation for the study of the ancient environment. Their project will complement the excavations and the archaeological surveys with a classic geoarchaeological methodology proceeding from the regional to the local, bringing the morpho-structural context to the study of environmental dynamics. Archaeological operations continued in the sounding of2005, which was enlarged to 22 x 10 m. (Figs. 20-21). Three principal architectural levels were established: I (latest)-III (earliest). More recent structures once existed, but erosion has rendered an analysis impossible. Traces of two different mud-brick structures were all that could be recognised from the final two phases of Level I. A large wall was discovered in 2005, locating what Tosi suggested might have been a "City Wall", based on aerial photos. Situated on the W edge of the sounding (where the site slopes steeply), and oriented N-S, this 1 m. wide wall has thus far been exposed over a distance of 17 m. This imposing wall (UF 29) is significantly larger than the walls of the other structures. Only Levels I and II are undoubtedly related to the "City Wall". VIA. "The City Wall" The extension of the excavation of the "City Wall" to the N and S, as well as the soundings sunk against its W side revealed that it was not uniformly well preserved, and that it had a complex construction. We identified three</page><page sequence="23">SISTAN AND BALUCHISTAN PROJECT 329 ^ ^ ; |^ ^-^ j SOUNDING _L,"'^ il | i :'L&amp; &lt;d ^~~r^L*- JL^c^ UF10 I ! ^ SOUNDING f I JL;l U _ ClJh I | j K^p3IXffl j j UF 122 1 ^ |^ j i J | SOUNDING wUJ J i-1 !

The central part (UF 29), uncovered in 2005, was four bricks or 1 m. wide, with a preserved height of 4 courses. In 2006 a sounding made against its W face revealed an additional 4 courses, below those exposed in the initial sounding. The lowest layer of bricks lies on a foundation of compact clay mortar, beneath which appears an earlier layer of occupation. The extension of the sounding to the S revealed a break?possibly a threshold?marked by two bricks (UF 121), to the S of which the "City Wall" assumes the same form identified in the central section, both in terms of the width and the size of the bricks (UF 122). Only one or two courses of bricks were conserved.</page><page sequence="24">330 S.M.S. SAJJADI, M. CASANOVA, L. COSTANTINI, AND K.O. LORENTZ r__ _r j_ !

The "City Wall" extends further S beyond our sounding. Its N part (UF 41) is similar to the other parts (UF 122, 29). A turn to an E-W orientation was observed (UF 109), as was an enlargement, possibly related to this turn. At the corner (UF 109-UF 41) was a destruction level composed of fragmentary mud bricks (UF 110). This will be examined during coming seasons in order to understand the stratigraphic position and relationships of the various architectural elements. Aside from some elements from the N section of the excavation, little has been found along the W side of this "City Wall". The most important material has been found in the occupa tional deposits on the E side, where two successive occu pational levels (I, II) were linked to this wall.</page><page sequence="25">SISTAN AND BALUCHISTAN PROJECT 331 The remains of the badly preserved Level I are char acterised by two areas directly backed by the eastern side of the "City Wall" (UF 29), defined by narrow walls of mud brick (Fig. 1). The first space is delimited by three walls (UF 15, UF 16 and UF 6, built atop wall UF 87 of Level II). A brick structure (UF 71) belonging to a later construction phase of this room was noted in the SW corner, against walls UF 15 and UF 29. Some structures with traces of burning uncovered in 2005 are probably related to this occupation. The wall UF 6, upon which a vase was found in 2005, continues to the E (UF 10). Unfortunately, we found nothing more of this occupation, as it was eroded away. A second, slightly smaller, space to the S of the first is defined by walls UF 16 and UF 117, built against UF 26 and UF 54 of Level II. A small hearth (UF 80) was built on the wall UF 117. Observed to the S, beyond these two groups, was a very badly preserved architectural structure of mudbrick dating to Level I (UF 118). The other elements of this Level, some still recognizable others less so, have for the most part disappeared, contributing to the thick clayey layer of eroded brick which covers a good part of the S part of our sounding. Level II is bettef preserved than Level I, and is the first occupation linked to the "City Wall". Our first space backed by the E side of the "City Wall" (UF 29) is defined by three walls (UF 54, UF 87, UF 73), each with its own foundation trench sunk into the levels of fill and the floors of Level III. The room was entered from the S, through the parallel walls UF 54 and UF 26, all arranged in a terrace above the layers of Level III. To the E, the layers of fill were heavily eroded; in the NW was a small hearth (UF 69). To the E, against this room, was a second area, badly eroded, defined by the walls UF 73 and UF 101, and characterised by a sequence of hearths, one of which (UF 116) was excavated, and a zone with domestic rubbish including potshards, animal bones and a piece of textile (UF 119). Further N was another E-W mud-brick wall (UF 7), with three courses preserved, built against the "City Wall" (UF 41). No architecture was exposed in the S part of the sounding?except for a very badly eroded E-W wall (UF 102) abutting wall UF 122. It is attributed to Level II as it post-dates the compact layer of Level III (UF 83), itself cut by wall UF 54 (Level II). Level III is represented only by some occupational traces found at the end of the campaign. In the N part of the sounding, wasters (UF 114), associated with a hearth (UF 115), were recovered as well as pottery, including complete piriform goblets, as well as animal bones and a scrap of textile. The associated architecture includes traces of an E-W mud-brick wall (UF 124), to which can be added some other, even less clear, mud-brick wall (UF 123), a hearth (UF 84) and various pockets of burnt earth and ashes to the E and S. The remains of Level III in the N part of the sounding appear to ante-date the N section of the "City Wall" (UF 41). In the central part of the sounding was a quadrangular hearth (UF 89) surrounded by other similar installations (UF 85, UF 106), as well as several layers of fill and floors which included pottery and animal bones. Only marginally exposed, a few crumbling bricks (UF 58) confirmed that there was an occupational level with mud-brick architecture in Level III in this area. To the S, elements linked to Level III consisted of layers of fill, including sherds and a few animal bones. Near the middle of the sounding was another layer, distinguished by its sedimentation which was gravely with abundant sherds and animal bones as well as figurines and organic remains. Belonging to a later phase of Level III, this gravel was cut and served as a foundation for the walls UF 26 and UF 54 of Level II. A layer of compact clay (UF 83) found at the end of the season probably belongs to a phase preceding the S part of the "City Wall" (UF 122). It was certainly cut by wall UF 54, and probably by wall UF 102 of Level II, but no architecture related to the era was actually found here. VI. 2. Cultural Material The pottery is generally uniform in all three occupation al levels. Most of it can be divided into two wares: sherds of fine, medium and coarse ware of a light hue (yellow to cream) or of a brown to light orange hue. Aside from these are a few carefully burnished sherds of finer ware, some grey and others light-brown to orange; both are probably imports. Many of the sherds are blackened, probably linked to kitchen use. The finest pottery, of light-coloured ware and frequently painted, consists for the most part of pear-shaped beakers, bowls, and also bowls and fragments of pots and jars (Fig. 22). Potters' marks are sometimes painted, sometimes incised on the base of the goblets. Amongst the other clay objects are anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines (bulls), as well as balls (Fig. 23). A few micro blades, some chips of flint, quartz, agate and lapis-lazuli, five sherds of calcite stone vases, 15 metal fragments and a bone awl were also collected. The finds of this sequence resemble forms from the Central Quarters assigned to phase 5B.

Further soundings on the W side of the site, and particularly to the N where erosion was less important, will likewise reveal both the nature of the "City Wall"?or if there are additional similar structures?as well as exposing additional occupational remains. We will also sink a trench into the ravine just north of the sounding to gain additional information about the sequence. Our goal in these proposed soundings is to develop a better understanding of the Craftsman s Zone. M. Casanova, University Rennes 2. Bibliography Acsadi, Gy. and Nemeskeri, J. 1970.
