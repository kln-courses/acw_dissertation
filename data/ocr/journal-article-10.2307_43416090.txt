<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vol. XLIV JULY, 1956 No. 175 SCIENCE PROGRESS TIME IN BIOLOGY* By J. B. S. HALDANE, M.A., D.Sc., F.R.S. Weldon Professor of Jiio?netry in the University of London, University College When I was a student at Oxford, forty-five years ago, Herbert Spencer was but little read, and he is probably still less read today. Yet we have only to study the works of such men as Darwin, Clifford, and the pioneer of animal ethology, Spalding, to see how powerful in his own day was his influence over men whose works are still read widely. Does this mean that our grandfathers and great-grandfathers were taken in by a man whose thought was after all worthless ? Far from it. Spencer took the science of his time, and tried to produce a coherent picture of the world. Much of his thinking was extremely original. But it was based on data which we now know were often very inadequate, as of course are the scientific data of our generation. Spencer succeeded in showing the connections between the different branches of science, and was thus of enormous help to the scientists of his time. Just for this reason his work dates. But I doubt if it dates as completely as the speeches and writings of his contemporary politicians and theologians. His terminology has largely fallen into desuetude, but it is still a stimulus to thought. Let me give a simple example. I open his Principles of Biology , and find a chapter headed " Indirect équilibration.'' I find that by this phrase Spencer meant approximately what Darwin described as natural selection. Organisms become adapted to their environment either directly, for example by changing their colour during a lifetime, as when men become suntanned, or indirectly, as when natural selection picks out the darkest individuals, and their progeny is on the average darker than the previous generation. " Selection " is a metaphor, though a good one. Romanes preferred the metaphor " winnowing." Spencer's phrase is more accurate, though less clear in its meaning. If Herbert Spencer were living today he might be undertaking the stupendous task of writing a synthetic philosophy embracing the results of scientific research up to the present moment. I am a biologist, but I am certainly incapable of writing a book with the * Part of the Herbert Spencer Lecture, Oxford, 1955. c c</page><page sequence="2">386 SCIENCE PROGRESS scope of his Principies of Biology. My humble tribute to Spencer this evening will be to read what might, perhaps, be a single chapter of such a book. Science is becoming more and more concerned with processes rather than objects, as Engels emphasised that it should be. But biologists are more particularly so. A crystallographer may be, and should be, interested in crystal growth. But usually he or she hopes that a crystal will not have changed appreciably while he or she studies it. He may even cool it down to very low tem- peratures to inhibit internal changes in it; and this technique, as I need not tell you, is very successfully practised at Oxford. But if you prevent internal changes in many, though not all, living things, they die. They are still suited for anatomical studies, but the anatomist asks how an organ was used, how it developed, how it evolved. He cannot escape this obsession with processes which is inevitable since life, the characteristic of living organisms, is not a substance or a quality, but a process or rather a set of processes. All that I shall do today is to mention some of the different processes which a biologist may study, and to make some rather obvious remarks about them. I shall not propound a theory of life or of time. If there are any philosophers in the narrow sense of that word in my audience I shall, at best, convince them that some of what they had regarded as differences of quality are better thought of as quantitative differences. Biologists must consider processes of which the most nearly instantaneous is perhaps the transformation of a molecule of living substance, and the most prolonged is the evolution of living beings. Within this immense range we can perhaps classify our events into five classes. The distinctions between them are in no way sharp. The classification which I shall give is relevant to the biology of my time. A century hence it may appear as archaic as some of Herbert Spencer's classifications do to ourselves. I propose to classify the processes which concern biologists as molecular, physiological, ontogenetical, historical, and evolutionary. I give a few examples of each. Typical molecular processes are the transformation of a molecule of lactose (milk sugar) and one of water into a molecule of glucose and one of galactose, or the union of a molecule of haemoglobin with from one to four molecules of oxygen to give oxy haemoglobin. These processes are completed in times which may be as short as a hundred thousandth of a second, though they may be as long as a second. Typical physiological processes are the contraction of a muscle or the contraction and relaxation of numerous muscles in such a process as walking. The</page><page sequence="3">TIME IN BIOLOGY 387 time scale of such processes is of the order of a hundredth of a second to an hour. Ontogenetic or developmental processes, which often occur only once in a lifetime, may be typified by the develop- ment of a limb, or the gradual acquisition of the instincts concerned in nest-building in the life of a bird. Ontogenetic processes all occupy an appreciable fraction of a life cycle, and cannot last for longer than a lifetime. I shall use the term historical processes for processes lasting through a number of lifetimes and involving thousands or millions of individuals, but not necessarily involving evolutionary changes large enough for biologists to detect. Typical of them are the colonisation of Britain in recent years by the fulmar, and the domestication of the golden hamster. Finally evolutionary changes " Vaster than empires, and more slow " are those by which the descendants of a group of organisms come to differ radically from their ancestors in morphology, physiology, and psychology. Ex- amples are the evolution of modern horses and related animals from many-toed, short-toothed ancestors, and the much more rapid evolution of the bread wheats from simpler wheats, and grasses of the genus Mgilops which were hybridised with them. Some molecular processes appear to be complete in a few millionths of a second. The whole evolutionary process on our planet has lasted more than five hundred million years, and almost certainly less than four thousand million. So our largest time interval is over 1022 times our smallest. Physicists tell us of processes enormously more rapid than molecular processes. If biologists were concerned with them they would perhaps need two more time scales. Some cosmologists hold that the age of the universe is not many times greater than that of life on our planet. Others think that the universe had no begin- ning. If so of course the evolution of life on our planet is an incident in an eternal sequence, and there is an infinity of processes slower than the evolutionary process. Each of the processes considered is built up of very great numbers of the processes quicker than itself. A muscular contraction is the resultant of thousands of millions of molecular transformations. The growth of a limb is the resultant of thousands of millions of cellular divisions, and the acquisition of a skill is the resultant of millions of muscular contractions guided by the nervous system. A historical process is the outcome of millions of lives. An evolu- tionary process is the resultant of many historical processes. One of these sets of processes, the physiological, is peculiarly privileged. It has the same time scale as the shortest events in</page><page sequence="4">388 SCIENCE PROGRESS our consciousness. And I personally hold that these events are physiological processes. To be concrete, I hold that a certain change in my brain and my will to speak are the same process. Whether or not this is so, we are much more directly aware of physiological processes both in ourselves and in other organisms than of those with shorter or longer time scales. We are just beginning to study molecular processes. To find out even that a caterpillar develops into a butterfly may take some weeks or months. Evolution can rarely be observed in a human lifetime. It is a deduction from a series of facts. It may be that as Thaïes, Heraclitus, Schopenhauer, and Royce, to mention no more, held, processes other than the physiological have mind-like correlates. It may be that their correlates are, in Spinoza's phrase, other modes of being, or that only nervous systems have this peculiar property. I personally incline to Spinozism, but perhaps on aesthetic rather than rational grounds. What I have said may appear obvious, or even trivial. But it is not completely trivial. If you ask a biologist a question such as " Why does the male chaffinch sing in spring as he does," he can give six different answers, which I shall proceed to enumerate. 1. A set of muscles contract as the result of transformations of adenosine triphosphate and other substances. These force air through his syrinx which vibrates in a characteristic manner. 2 a. A singing centre in his brain is active and sends a pattern of impulses down nerves to various muscles, producing a pattern of song. 26. He sings because he wants to, his emotions being comparable with some human emotions. 3. He sings because he is a male, and his testes have grown under the influence of the longer spring days, and produced hormones which act on his brain. 4. He sings because the song which he sings is traditional in British chaffinches, and he learned it. 5. He sings because it is advantageous that small birds should sing before and during the breeding season to repel other males, and attract unmarried females, of their own species, and hence that each species should have a distinctive song. Of course this list is not exhaustive. But all these answers are, in my opinion, true. We see that, in this example at least, the dis- tinction between efficient, material, formal, and final causes, which our forefathers took so seriously, turns out to depend on the tem- poral scale of the processes among which we look for causation. I would also lay particular emphasis on the penultimate answer, the</page><page sequence="5">TIME IN BIOLOGY 389 historical one. The songs of chaffinches vary in different parts of the world. Those of the Thames valley have a more complicated song than those of Moscow, the Urals, the Azores, or even the Lake district, but probably on an average less so than those of the Scottish Highlands. Hand-reared chaffinches sing a song rather like that of the greenfinch, and learn the local song dialect, if they learn it at all, when just under a year old. I lay some stress on this fact because I recently read a paper by a philosopher from this city in which it was asserted that animals had no history. On the contrary, many social animals have a good deal of tradition, often with local variations. The science of cultural ornithology was founded by Pernau and Barrington in the eigh- teenth century. It was apparently forgotten in the nineteenth. So far as I know Herbert Spencer, though a polymath, ignored it. In this century it was revived by Promptoff in the Soviet Union, and is being vigorously studied by Thorpe and his colleagues, especially Marler (1952), at Cambridge. I shall now deal in rather more detail with our five groups of processes. Life, said Engels, is the mode of existence of proteins. Certainly other large molecules, such as nucleic acids, are almost, if not quite, as essential to life as proteins. Engels' statement is, of course, one-sided. So was Aristotle's statement that history, or politics, is the mode of existence of men. It may be that if we knew enough about large molecules we could deduce the nature of the organisms of which they are parts. It may be that if we knew enough human psychology we could deduce the general pattern of human history. But we do not know enough to do so in either case. The attempt to deduce the behaviour of complex systems from the properties of their components is sometimes described as crass materialism. In Europe it goes back to Pythagoras through Plato, especially in the curious myth of the triangles in the Timaeus. In India, if I understand the summaries of his teaching correctly, it goes back to Kanada and the Vaisesika school. It is at least one of the major tendencies of human thought. It is probably often sterile if the components are as simple as they appear when we first discover them. But this apparent simplicity is misleading. A hydrogen atom consists, we say, of two simple separable parts, a proton and an electron. Nevertheless it can emit a series of radiations considerably more complicated than the series of notes emitted by a piano. Quantum mechanics enable us to calculate the properties of a hydrogen atom. It has an extremely complex mode of being, or rather becoming, which we can describe mathe- matically, but not in terms of spatial and temporal relations. Nor</page><page sequence="6">390 SCIENCE PROGRESS does this mode of being suggest that a mind is associated with it. To me, at least, it suggests one of the other modes of being at which Spinoza guessed. But I am trespassing on the territory of physicists. Let me return to the molecular level to describe some simple types of spirit. I use the word spirit as it was used by many mediaeval thinkers, by Descartes, and by Milton. According to Descartes, animal spirits descended the motor nerves, entered the muscles, and caused them to contract. We now know, thanks in particular to Katz, that what passes from a nerve ending to a muscle is acetyl-choline. Nachmanssohn believes that it also plays a part in nervous con- duction, but this is disputed. The amounts needed are extremely small. A milligram would probably keep your biceps muscle in contraction for several weeks. If you still regard its identification with spirit as crass materialism, let me cite a passage from the Archangel Raphael's speech in Book V of " Paradise Lost." " So from the root Springs lighter the green branch, from thence the leaf More aërie, next the bright consummat flour Spirits odorous breathes. Flours and thir fruit, Man's nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd To vital spirits aspire, to animal, To intellectual, give both life and sense, Fansie and understanding." I suppose Raphael and I are crass materialists. However acetyl- choline is not, as in Descartes' concept, directly responsible for muscular contraction. The source of the energy of this process appears to be adenosine-triphosphate, which shares with acetyl- choline the attributes that Descartes applied to animal spirits. A molecule of this kind of animal spirit weighs as much as about 360 hydrogen atoms, and consists of 44 atoms of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus. One part of the molecule, consisting of an atom of phosphorus, two of oxygen, and one of hydrogen, is readily detachable, and in a living cell this part is constantly being transferred to other molecules, which are then excited to perform various actions such as muscular contraction, luminescence, secretion, and the formation of larger molecules. In muscular contraction there is certainly at least one intermediate step. The depleted spirit molecule can replenish this part from other molecules such as phosphopyruvic acid, which have gained internal energy as the result of oxidation. Indeed the main bio- logical function of oxidation in our bodies now appears to be the</page><page sequence="7">TIME IN BIOLOGY 391 production of animal spirit in its excited form of adenosine-triphos- phate from the relatively inert form, adenosine-diphosphate. I apologise for the anthropomorphic term excitation. However, physicists speak of excited atoms, and I prefer to use this phrase rather than a circumlocution which would be equally metaphorical. Animal spirit thus has something resembling the metabolism of an animal. After a meal it can do some work. It also has a property comparable to sexuality. Two molecules of adenosine-diphosphate, or animal spirit in its unexcited form, can interact to yield one molecule of excited animal spirit, and one of adenylic acid, which, in a living cell, is then usually destroyed by enzymes. The hormones correspond very well to the Cartesian conception of vital spirits, being concocted or, as we now prefer to say, syn- thesised in one organ, and regulating the vital processes of others to which they are carried by the blood stream. From different parts of the brain no less than eight substances have been isolated (Vogt, 1954) which, in very small concentrations, act on other cells. Since they are most concentrated in the hypothalamus, the part of the brain believed to be particularly concerned with the control of visceral processes and with instinctive activities, they are prob- ably not to be identified with Raphael's intellectual spirits. As I have argued elsewhere (Haldane, 1954) they are perhaps identical with what certain psychological schools describe as " drives." However, such a provisional identification seems to arouse almost equal opposition among materialists, who too often wish to ignore consciousness, and idealists, many of whom believe that various objects such as idols, books, and wafers, have supernatural properties. We know too little about the structures of the larger molecules in living beings, such as the proteins and nucleic acids, to say much about the transformations which they undergo. But we do know, thanks to the discovery of transamination by Braunstein and Kritzmann in the Soviet Union, and its development by the use of isotopes mainly in the United States, that protein molecules in living cells, whilst preserving their form, are constantly exchanging atoms with their environments. It is, I think, too early even to guess at the biological significance of this process. We can only say that these molecules, though they can be preserved in a static condition, are showing in their normal environment some of the characteristics of living organisms. On the other hand, desoxy- ribonucleic acid, which is the physical basis of heredity, is far more stable, and exchanges very few atoms with neighbouring molecules. You will notice that I have deliberately used terms appropriate to the physiological and psychological time scale to describe events</page><page sequence="8">392 SCIENCE PROGRESS on the molecular level. This is, in my opinion, as legitimate as the converse process, sometimes called materialistic interpretation. The biological processes which have been the particular study of physiologists, and many of which, such as muscular movement, secretion, heat production, and so on, are familiar to all of us, are the resultants of millions of molecular processes, co-ordinated to a certain extent, but by no means completely, by nervous and other agencies. The amount of variation which occurs is a little sur- prising. In fact the molecular processes are regulated statistically, but not individually. For example, the oxygen supply to an organ is partly regulated by the vasomotor nervous system, which controls the rate at which blood flows through it, but the various molecules which can unite with oxygen seem to compete for it in a manner best described statistically. On the other hand, quite a small number of molecular processes, or even a single one, may start off a physiological process. When the human eye is as well adapted to darkness as possible, the absorp- tion of about five quanta of light, that is to say the transformation of five molecules of the light-sensitive pigment rhodopsin, may be enough to cause a sensation of light, and to induce a man to perform some muscular action whose consequences may go on indefinitely, as when an astronomer discovers a previously unknown asteroid. This principle holds throughout biology. A single muscular con- traction may make the difference between life and death. Great men in the past founded religions and empires ; others, like Marx " O'erthrew them with prophesying To the old of the new world's worth." * From the point of view of an observer of the slower process these key events on a shorter time scale appear fortuitous. If those who carry them out are conscious beings they can only say " For this cause came I into the world." The ontogenetic processes are studied by embryologists, physio- logists, geneticists, and psychologists, including ethologists. They introduce the notion of development. During its lifetime the morphology and physiology of an organism change, usually slowly, but occasionally by dramatic and irreversible processes such as birth, emergence from a pupa, and death. This notion has coloured our views of other processes. We talk of old and young cultures, the birth and death of states and species, and so on. Such analogies * If this quotation is considered out of place in a biological lecture, I can reply that O'Shaughnessy was not one of the " world-losers and world - forsakers " but curator of insects in the Natural History Museum.</page><page sequence="9">TIME IN BIOLOGY 393 may be useful didactically. Spencer began his discussion of evolu- tion by pointing out that each individual man developed from something far less like a man than is a reptile or even a fish. He argued from this that the evolution of man from animals was not incredible. But the analogy, which he took seriously, between development and evolution is at best a half truth, and may be seri- ously misleading. He did, however, give English the word evolu- tion, in its accepted meaning. No such word exists in French, where " l'évolution " means both changes in an individual and in a species, though the French have the useful word " transformisme " meaning the doctrine of evolution. The Germans, unless they are prepared to use the word " Evolution " which is of Latin origin and therefore taboo in some sections of their society, have no word either, though again they have the very useful word " Abstam- mungslehre " with no precise English equivalent. The Sanskrit " parinama " is more nearly equivalent to " evolution," but applies also to physical processes. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that individual development, historical change, and evolutionary change are quite separate processes. The position of genetics is exceptional in the biological sciences, for a curious reason. Some of the differences between individuals are due to differences in a single gene in each nucleus. Genes may be single molecules or areas of very large molecules. They are certainly of molecular dimensions, and a gene can be changed by the action of a single particle of high energy. Apart from these rare changes, or mutations, most genes are reproduced very accur- ately at most nuclear divisions. Consequently a single molecular change can affect the development of a large number of plants or animals. So can an infection with a single molecule of a molecular virus. Now genes are only recognised by the differences produced when one is substituted for another, for example the difference between a black and a tabby cat, or a peach and a nectarine. So they are naturally called after the characters in whose determination they play a part. Further, like genes in different cells and different individuals are called by the same name. Applied to common objects such terminological inexactitudes are usually harmless. If I say that I have got Caesar and Cleopatra in my pocket, you will hardly expect either that the first emperor and the last Lagid will emerge from it, or that I shall produce Shaw's original manuscript of the play. But many geneticists, and most popularisers of genetics, have become the dupes of their vocabulary, and Lysenko, while pointing out some of their paralogisms, has used them to discredit genetical theory in general, and to put forward a theory</page><page sequence="10">394 SCIENCE PROGRESS with far less scientific basis than Mendelism. I do not deny that he and his colleagues have discovered some important genetical phenomena which have nothing particular to do with genes. Cor- rens, one of the original discoverers of Mendelism, did so in 1902, as did Bateson, its protagonist in Britain, in 1926 and earlier. Today, however, it is not safe to discover such phenomena in certain countries. Rutman, who did so in Philadelphia, lost his job, as Mendelians lost their jobs in the Soviet Union. The current con- troversies in genetics are largely due to the extreme difficulty of thinking simultaneously on the molecular and ontogenetic levels, which involves at least some thought on the physiological level which lies between them. Modes of behaviour develop during a lifetime just as do organs. The maturation of a process may or may not depend on learning. Thus a blackbird reared by human beings from the egg sings a song which is perfect, at least to human ears. A skylark must learn its song. Its art is no more unpremeditated than was Shelley's. There seems to be a fairly complete series of intermediates between these two extremes. The same is true throughout the field of animal behaviour. American workers have attended particularly to learned activities. Western European workers, for example Tinbergen at Oxford, have concentrated their attention on instinctive or unlearned activities. Soviet workers have studied both, but have tended to describe them in the rather rigid terminology of Pavlov as con- ditioned and unconditioned reflexes. Spurway (1955a) has recently pointed out that these activities can be described in the terminology which the Swedish botanist Turesson (1922) invented to describe the responses of plants to their environments. If this were done we should at least be able to jettison the word instinct. To me at least it seems ridiculous to say that the pattern of song is an instinct in blackbirds and a tradition in skylarks, if only because in the huge majority of bird species we do not know to which category it should be referred. The song is an event on the physiological time scale. I do not see why it should be named in terms of events on the ontogenetical scale. There is, however, a much more serious reason against such a dichotomy. Most, but certainly not all, activities which are now instinctive in a species were probably learned in its ancestors. And in human evolution at least the contrary process has probably been at work. Our behaviour depends more on learning and is less instinctive than that of most animals. The possibility is thus at least open that someone will find a blackbird which has to learn its song, or a lark which sings it untaught. Many books have been written on the history of the domestic</page><page sequence="11">TIME IN BIOLOGY 395 animals. One, Lefebvre de Noëttes' L'attelage et le cheval de selle à travers les âges , is also a major contribution to human history. The first history of a wild animal species was published in 1952. This is James Fisher's The Fulmar , in its conception perhaps the most original book published during my lifetime. It describes the slow spread of the Atlantic fulmar southward from the Arctic. It was first recorded as nesting in Iceland about 1640, though it may have done so much earlier, and gradually colonised its coasts. In 1839 the first fulmars are recorded as nesting in the Faeroes, and had spread all round them by 1900. They had already occupied St. Kilda by 1697, but did not spread thence to Britain. In 1878 they were breeding on one of the Shetland Islands. The first nests in the Orkneys were seen in 1900. About 1904 they first bred on the mainland of Scotland. By 1949 they had established breeding colonies on the cliffs of Norfolk and in 1945 they were breeding at Land's End, whence they had reached South Devon by 1950. They had been seen prospecting the Kentish cliffs in 1949, and may by now be breeding there, or even in France. The most surprising fact is perhaps that the fulmars did not colonise Britain from St. Kilda during two centuries, apparently because its human inhabi- tants kept their numbers down by eating their eggs and young, at an average rate of 1 15 fulmars per human being per year. Clearly the St. Kilda fulmars had not the spirit of the Phocseans or the Pilgrim Fathers. But perhaps this materialistic interpretation is not the whole story, and the birds which colonised Britain may have differed from some of their contemporaries in instincts, tradi- tions, or both. Fisher's book is a work of scholarship ; the works consulted range from the Icelandic sagas to New Zealand bird notes. Like any other historical work which tried to be comprehensive, it is not very easy reading. But it is, I believe, unique. We have gone a long way since Alkaios asked opndeç ríveç óíô ' á&gt;Keávco yoLÇ t' anv neppároov 9¡X6ov navèloneç noixiXóòeppoi ravvaínrepoi ; (" What are these birds, geese (or possibly ducks) with variegated necks and spreading wings, which have come from the ocean and the ends of the earth ? ") My own guess is Branta ruficollis , but possibly Histrionicus histrionicus . We know less about cultural changes in wild animals, but we know that they happen, for example that the great tits, both in England and Holland, are taking to opening milk bottles, that the robin, which in Germany a generation since was a shy forest bird, is now becoming as fearless of men as the English robin. In the</page><page sequence="12">396 SCIENCE PROGRESS latter the change may in part be genetic. But there is no evidence for this hypothesis. In a century or so we should know something about changes in the songs of such birds as the chaffinch. The interest of such studies for human philologists is obvious. Evolutionary change is usually an extremely slow process. I was perhaps the first to estimate its rate for a quantitative char- acter, though Simpson (1953) has improved my estimate. We have good data on the teeth of species ancestral, or close to the ancestral line, of the modern horses, asses, and zebras. These have been lengthening fairly steadily for about fifty million years, as an adaptation to eating grass, which would wear down short teeth. Some of this lengthening is merely due to the general increase in the size of the animals. If we concentrate on a ratio of lengths, which is a measure of the tooth's shape, the average change was about 2 per cent, per million years. Some dinosaurs became gigantic. But in the best studied lineages the average increase in length was about 4 per cent, per million years. If men were evolving at a thousand times this rate, which seems highly improbable, we might look for a 4 per cent, change in the average of some important character since the reign of King Canute. For this very simple reason I am little impressed by arguments either that the human race is evolving in an undesirable direction or that it will evolve in a desirable one if certain steps are taken. One of Hitler's minor errors was a confusion of the historical and evolutionary time scales. For the same reason I am critical of the attempts made by some contemporary British biologists to use evolution as an ethical criterion. Until human evolution has been observed, it is unlikely that we shall learn how to control it or even to influence it, still less to use it as a norm for our moral conduct. There are, of course, evolutionary events which occur in a human lifetime. One such has been the replacement of light moths by darker forms in the smoky industrial areas of England in the nine- teenth and twentieth centuries. Kettle well is at last proving what had long been guessed, that their colour protects them from pre- datory birds. Such rapid events are of course part of evolution, as the decapitation of Charles I, a physiological event which took a fraction of a second, is a part of history. But they are exceptional, as the palaeontological record shows. The simplest unit in which to measure the evolutionary process would be the origin of a species, if Darwin had not shown that this term is a convenience and little more. Species, we now believe, can originate abruptly or gradually. Some species of higher plants have, it seems, originated abruptly by hybridisation followed by a</page><page sequence="13">TIME IN BIOLOGY 397 doubling of the chromosome number. The sea-grass Spartina Townsendii originated in this way in Southampton water about 1870, and in the last ten years several new plant species have been made artificially in California, and are now standing trial by natural selection. However, this process, if it occurs at all (as I think it does in a few insect groups), is certainly rare among higher animals. Mayr (1942) has made out a very strong case that new species of higher animals usually arise by the complete or partial separation of a former species by geographical barriers, and the slow diver- gence of the two populations, until they no longer interbreed freely if they meet. That is to say species arise as the result of two historical processes, the spread of a species to areas where the different races are subjected to different natural selections, and sometimes the coming together of species so formed to give rise to new hybrid types. However, the evolutionary changes which occur in the different areas are largely due to molecular processes in genes and chromosomes. These molecular processes give rise to physiological and ontogenetic processes on whose success or failure in the struggle for life, or rather for progeny, natural selection depends. Callan and Spurway (see Spurway, 1953) have studied the pro- cess of speciation in the European newts. Within the species called the Great Crested Newt, Triturus cristatus , the process of species formation has gone so far that, although newts from London and Naples give vigorous hybrids of which about 80 per cent, survive to maturity, yet only about 4 per cent, of their progeny survive. These hybrids are thus effectively almost sterile. The high larval mortality is at least partly due to quite a few chromosomal changes which have apparently occurred in single individuals of these species who happened to colonise new habitats. For in a large population chromosomes of an unusual type are eliminated by natural selection. That is to say a peculiar combination of molecular and historical events has been necessary. Such combinations, like the birth of a great man at the particular moment of history when a Cromwell has the opportunity not to be guiltless, will certainly occur given sufficient time. They have their causes. But to an observer who is using the evolutionary time scale they appear to be the effects of chance. This merely means that he cannot predict them. Natural selection, however, eliminates this apparent randomness, as we saw that physiological regulation tempered the apparent randomness of molecular events of another type. It is conceivable that there are mind-like " emergents," or other modes of being, related to the historical and evolutionary processes</page><page sequence="14">398 SCIENCE PROGRESS as our minds are related to our physiological processes. I think this rather unlikely, since history and evolution seem to me less integrated than physiology. But if such beings exist, I see no reason why we should bow down and worship them, as for example Comte wished us to do, and very good reasons why we should not. It seems to me that Jung's " collective unconscious " is the reification of some remarkable facts. Human beings, or many of them, find certain ideas emotionally exciting, as for example many birds prefer the song of their own species to that of others, even if they have never heard it before. This can hardly be due to " racial memory," as worker bees, without learning, exchange information by a code of dances which are not danced by their ancestors, the queens and drones. In Lorenz's terminology, which I find unduly mechanistic, certain sensory patterns, for example, patterns of colour or sound, operate " innate releasing mechanisms " in the brains of animals, which release particular patterns of behaviour such as flight, court- ship, aggression, or feeding. It may be that a pattern conforming to one of Jung's archetypes operates an innate releasing mechanism in the human brain. I do not think that the facts marshalled by Jung call for any more metaphysical explanation and am inclined to support Lorenz's (1951) claim to have discovered their etiology. If, however, the collective unconscious has being in its own right, so far from conforming to it, we should be on our guard against irrational conduct induced by it. It is clear that the different time scales used in biology require different types of thought. Further, our knowledge about the events on these scales is based on different sets of facts. My own contributions to biology have mostly been on the molecular, physio- logical, and evolutionary scales. A geneticist must try to bridge the huge range between these scales, as an astrophysicist must think of stars and atoms, but rather less of objects of intermediate size. I do not believe that fruitful thought with such a range is possible without the aid of mathematics. This does not mean that biology must be reduced to mathematics. I am no Pythagorean. It simply means that without the aid of mathematics we cannot determine whether a given process will have a noticeable effect after a hundred years, or only after a thousand million. There is, however, a discipline of mathematical biology, or more accurately of mathematics applicable to biology, and it is notable that it is applicable to biological phenomena on several different levels. Let us consider a very simple mathematical tool, a life table. The first life tables were made by Graunt in the seventeenth century. They are now made by actuaries for the use of insurance</page><page sequence="15">TIME IN BIOLOGY 399 companies. A human life table traces the fate of a cohort of men or women born in a given year. So many survive one year, fewer survive ten, and so on. Physical chemists are concerned with life tables of molecules. The molecular species A is transformed into B, and we can observe what fraction of A remains after a given time. If the death rate is constant we speak of a unimolecular or pseudo -unimolecular reaction, and so on. We can do just the same with cells. We know for example that the red corpuscles of a normal man mostly last about three months, after which their death rate rather suddenly becomes very high. We can do it for wild animals. Lack has compiled life tables for a number of birds, and in fact we know more about the survival of starlings in England than about that of men in China. A quantitative study of for- getting, or of the extinction of a conditioned reflex, may be regarded as a life table on the ontogenetic scale. Simpson (1953) has drawn up several life tables for genera from the fossil record. He deals with genera rather than species because palaeontologists are clearer as to distinctions between genera than between species. However, Small (1946) has done the same for certain species. A genus can cease to be, either because all its members have died without issue, or because all its surviving descendants have changed so much as to be classified as members of one or more new genera. Simpson concludes that all mammalian genera are relatively short-lived. The average life of a genus of carnivores is about 6-8 million years. A mammal must evolve or perish. Most molluscan genera are fairly short-lived, but a few are struldbrugs, having begun in the Palaeo- zoic but, unlike the struldbrugs, showing no signs of senility. Small makes an even sharper distinction between persistent and evanescent species. I have published work on the life tables of enzyme molecules and of lapwings. The mathematics required are sufficiently different to be interesting, but both are based on New- tonian ideas. Philologists are beginning to publish life tables of words, but their transformations are so great and numerous that it is hard to say when a word has become obsolete. Here then is an example of a mathematical description applicable on all of our five time scales. To sum up, many of the difficulties of biology arise from the need of thinking simultaneously in several time scales. If we think too exclusively on the molecular time scale we shall be led to mech- anistic materialism. If we think too exclusively on the evolutionary scale we shall be led into an exaggerated teleology. We shall always ask what is the function of an organ, rather than how it works or how it develops in the life of an individual. When thinking on our</page><page sequence="16">400 SCIENCE PROGRESS favourite time scale no longer helps us, we shall begin to talk of insoluble mysteries. The different time scales correspond to different levels of organi- sation, of which Needham in particular has emphasised the import- ance ; and much of what I have said could have been said in terms of levels of organisation. My own approach to biology has perhaps been too quantitative. If so I must blame the Oxford school of Litterae Humaniores for introducing me to Plato and Aristotle with their emphasis on geometry and tò / ietqiov . No doubt the time scale with which an investigator concerns himself depends on the type of organisation which interests him. I have not exhausted my subject, but only the time at my disposal. I might have given the whole lecture on the orientation of biological thought to the past, present, or future. It is trivial that orientation of a biologist to the present leads to description, orientation to the past to a mechanical account of biological events, orientation to the future to a teleological account. It is not trivial, and was first said by Bateson, that the consideration of an organism's descendants leads to a better understanding of heredity than does that of its ancestors. Nor is Spurway's (19556) remark on taxonomy trivial. Species were at first taken for granted as timeless. They are still defined, as they should be etymologically, mainly by their visual appearances. Gilbert White (1784) was the first to use a non-visual criterion when he separated the chiffchaff from the warblers on the basis of their songs. Linnaeus defined them by the past when he wrote that they had been separately created. Darwin (1878) was equally orientated to the past when he wrote ( Origin of Species, final chapter), " Our classifications will come to be, as far as they can be so made, genealogies ; and will then truly give what may be called the plan of creation." But where experiment is possible, modern biologists tend to place organisms in different species if they give no hybrids, or sterile hybrids, in other words if they will have no common descendants. Species are thus defined in terms of future events. I am convinced that taxonomists, like the three Norns, should concern themselves with past, present, and future. The concrete consideration of time cannot fail to affect one's emotional attitude to the universe. The simplest reaction is one of sorrow and even terror " Tempus nos auidum deuorat et chaos " * Kali dances on the body even of Siva. Such emotions are * Seneca, Troades. This is perhaps the earliest enunciation of the ineluctable increase of entropy.</page><page sequence="17">TIME IN BIOLOGY 401 particularly strong in a time like the present, when institutions to which we are prepared to devote our lives prove as mortal as individual men and women. One can escape from this gloom in two different ways. One can hold with Plato, or with some of the interpreters of the Christian doctrine of eternal life, that individual human beings can somehow transcend time. Or one can accept the concrete account of time which science is beginning to give us. Only the Hindus among pre -scientific thinkers had dared to postulate stretches of time comparable to those revealed by geology, and for this reason if no other the emotional attitude to the universe result- ing from such an acceptance will in some respects resemble the Hindu attitude. On this ground, and I think on other grounds also, Warren Hastings, in his preface to the first English translation of the Bhagavad Gita , was justified in prophesying that the Hindu writings in which this attitude is recorded " will survive when the British dominion in India shall have long ceased to exist, and when the sources which it once yielded of wealth and power are lost to remembrance." The unconquered sun has shone for some four thousand million years, and may shine for a yet greater time in the future. Life on our planet has probably only just begun. We are the first living beings to realise this fact. We cannot tell what its realisation will mean for future generations. But I think they will gradually begin to realise what the great religious teachers have been speaking in parables to the blind, namely, that you and I are extremely un- important as individuals, but that our efforts are not necessarily futile, even though they rarely lead to the results which we intend. If one takes a sufficiently long view in time, the world appears better than our ancestors had dared to hope. References Bateson, W. (1926). Segregation. J. Genet., 16, 219-221. Darwin, C. (1878).
