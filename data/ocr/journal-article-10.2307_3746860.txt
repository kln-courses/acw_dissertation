<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE STATUS OF PHYSICAL CONCEPTS.' JOHN C. BEGG, F.R.A.S. CONTEMPLATING certain residual mists, the net proceeds of a material world exploded and disintegrated by the relentless pene- tration of scientific intellect, the more advanced physicist has been led in recent times to co-operate with the philosopher on a common plane. Not so long ago, and not always without reason, the philo- sopher was regarded somewhat askance. It is the old antithesis between the practical man and the theorist, the scientific man himself having been regarded for long as a dreamer. All depends upon the level of action. Operating in the wilds the black tracker has nothing to gain by pausing for the slow, if sure, dictum of the scientist; and if a Mercator projection of the world, or a sextant, were offered to a primitive navigator of well-known home waters, these important aids to the sailor of longer voyages would probably be thrown in a corner, if not overboard. The launching forth on to wide oceans created the occasion for, and proved the value of, such products of exact thought. Thus, in his highest abstractions, the physicist must perforce become a philosopher. At the very least, the need of review and evaluation from a more general standpoint will be conceded. Physical concepts have to do with Nature considered as objective; and, in the more simple form, they comprise the ordinary naive view of the world (sticks, stones, etc.), a view which will continue to possess its value and importance. Logic and inductive science, however, seek an interpretation less beset with anomalies and inadequacies; although the cynic might plausibly question the present success of this quest! However, the naive picture of a world I This essay (with but slight variation) was read at the Auckland meeting of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science, in January 1937. It outlines and illustrates a doctrine that leaves unprejudiced a place for the "real" as transcendent, metaphysical, or mystical. The "real" of ordinary or scientific discourse, however, bears a relative signi- ficance, and is subject to degrees, the fluctuating boundaries of its denotation depending upon subjective organization, both sensory and intellectual, and being affected by instinct and purpose. iThis does not by any means negate objectivity, but affords an analysis of its conditioning circumstances. It is worthy of note that, at the same meeting, Dr. S. Moore, of Dunedin, propounded a psycho-analytic theory of knowledge in which similar con- clusions emerged. He substitutes "mass feeling" for Freud's "unconscious" as the source which, guided by purpose, articulates varying fields of objectivity.-J. C. B. 68</page><page sequence="2">THE STATUS OF PHYSICAL CONCEPTS of objects disposed here and there throughout space, each with its detached quasi-personality (probably derived from primitive animism) received a severe set-back with the advent of "field" theories. It was Ernst Mach, a German physicist of last century, and regarded by his contemporaries as somewhat erratic, who met the difficulty of transmission of influence through empty space, such as the gravitational pull of the sun upon the earth, by denying the presence of any real difficulty. How can a thing act where it is not ? But, said Mach, "it is WHERE IT ACTS." That is, a so-called indi- vidual object may pervade the environment, or, indeed, the Uni- verse. Along this line also came the work of Faraday and Clerk- Maxwell, and later that of Einstein. Mach showed further that ideas used in ordinary explanation are just as inexplicable ultimately as recognized mysteries. That the sun should move the earth by gravitational action across the great gulf of empty space is no whit more wonderful than contact phenomena, as when one ball pushes another; for contact is not coincidence, nor yet separation, but something wholly indefinite. This mystery has grown familiar, and our minds, said Mach, are satisfied if we can somehow reduce un- common unintelligibilities to common unintelligibilities. In the last analysis physics must simply accept the fact, and not search for the metaphysical "why." An important question for philosophy arises when we ask whether Nature, as we look out upon it, is a detached, independent realm, or, on the other hand, a reflexion in some measure of the observing mind. The history of thought has exhibited an oscillation of opinion concerning the objective and the subjective. Indeed, this matter has been deemed so vital that a philosopher is largely characterized, by his views upon it. In this rapid survey we may set out with an assertion that is little more than a truism; namely, that all intellectual life, both of common sense and of the scientific order, develops in individual experience. If we could think of the pure experience of a single person at one time and one place, the objective world would merge in the subjective, but they would not be quite coincident, because will and emotion both contain a phase which defies objectification. Pure static experience is however an ideal. As soon as time intrudes (as is inevitable), and we move about, there commences a panorama which composes our minds. It comprises, not merely orthodox perceptions, but illusions, dream images, pleasure, and pain. We have here the primary, individual world. If, leaving the single personal standpoint, we step out among our fellows and live in the common domain of Nature, we are com- pelled to shed off a great deal of this primary train of experience, because there is so much that is evanescent and irrelevant to any- body but ourselves. To the things that assert themselves obtru- 69</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY sively and consistently in the common domain of Nature we assign the abode of a single space and time system in which our bodies move. A rather more abstract Nature now emerges-the world of common sense. Still, a great deal that in ordinary life we find objective and common property, although IN space and time, are not OF them- colours, odours, and, perhaps more ambiguously, tastes, etc. While we include all these in the common-sense world, physical science, which does not shy at a further step away from actual experience, finds many such things unsuited to be inhabitants of its more puri- fied realm, and has, in fact, progressively endeavoured to confine its objectivity to space and time themselves, eked out by a content the mode of which tends to become merely formal, approaching pure number. So emerges in the third phase still another Nature, with radical departures from the two previously described worlds. Sir Arthur Eddington, in developing his physical philosophy, has made much use of a sharp distinction between the familiar world of common objects-tables, etc.-and the scientific world of electric particles, waves, and mathematical functions. This twofold division, while doubtless serving Eddington's purposes in exposi- tion, would seem to suffer from omitting the very important dis- tinctions which differentiate the individual world from the familiar common world. A headache, for example, is an unquestionable citizen of the former, but, to say the least, is not fully naturalized in the latter. Again, setting the familiar and scientific worlds in sharp contrast is apt to obscure the continuity of ideas which unites them, diverse as they undoubtedly are. The threefold division here suggested is not intended to imply definite boundaries or complete diversity in the world as apprehended from different standpoints. On the contrary, similar notions are to be found in all three worlds, with, however, radically changing emphasis, as will be further illustrated presently. Meantime, it may be asserted that the individual world of an impossible paragon of knowledge, who would require also to be ubiquitous, would include both the familiar common-sense world and that of science. On the other hand, neither of the latter could contain the world of the individual in all its fullness. Before proceeding farther along this train of thought, a few reflexions must be devoted to meeting an inevitable question. Which of these differing worlds is the real one? First, it is necessary to point out that the term "real" is commonly used in a trans- cendental or metaphysical sense to which we cannot assign any empirical meaning. Something is postulated within the veil, not only in abstruse metaphysics or theology, but also by materialism. It appears as unobservable "substratum" in Locke's philosophy, 70</page><page sequence="4">THE STATUS OF PHYSICAL CONCEPTS and as "thing-in-itself" in Kant. It may probably be true that the power of the metaphysical 'real' to invade popular thought is based upon the supposition of a vague potentiality of manifestation some- where or somewhen. Although physics has endeavoured to abandon transcendental notions, which have often played the role of stop- gaps, it must be remembered that such notions play a necessary part in ordinary life. When Laplace told Napoleon that his science had no need of the God hypothesis, he might have added truthfully that it had no need of the fellow-man hypothesis, the beauty hypothesis, the goodness hypothesis, the free-will hypothesis; and now we could add even the time hypothesis as formerly understood, for modem scientific interpretations of Nature have robbed time of its stability and character, substituting something variable and purely symbolic, in which past, present, and future have no absolute significance. But the human mind cannot easily place these things entirely to one side even in scientific activities. Mathematical physics indeed can scarcely escape entirely from metaphysics. Philosophical physicists emphasize over and over again that we cannot express "things in themselves," but knowledge or, at least, explicit know- ledge, must be confined to relations. Nevertheless, the symbols by which the terms of these relations are expressed must mean some- thing, or, as Bertrand Russell has said, they would be only marks on paper. The idea of entity is not easily exorcised. It seems doubtful if the line separating physics from metaphysics can ever be clearly drawn, leaving no margin of overlap; but a valid distinction remains. In regard to the concept "real," it must, if used by physics, have some empirical import-perhaps not so crude as that indicated by Dr. Johnson when he refuted the idealism of Berkeley by thumping his stick against the ground, but based essentially on that principle. It would be a comparative term, like "tall," the degree varying with the importance and consistency (rather than the violence) of the appearance under consideration. The thump of Dr. Johnson's stick may carry a very significant tale: possibly the hammer of activity meeting the anvil of resistance generates the sparks (to speak metaphorically) which shape them- selves into the objective world. However, this present discourse must not desert the cognitive level. We have spoken of the similarities and disparities which charac- terize the three worlds in which each of us may, in a measure, hold our discourse, namely, the individual world, the common-sense world, and the scientific world. Taking these admittedly over- lapping domains in the order named, we shall find that in moving out from intimate individual perceptions, and the cruder concepts which accompany them, and considering the series as it leads to the abstract universe depicted by mathematical physics, we encounter 7I</page><page sequence="5">P HILOSOPHY regions progressively poorer in intrinsic content. The Nature of common sense no longer contains the myriad images, emotions, and fantasies that parade in and constitute the individual world. Yet it contains colours, sounds, etc., the significance of which, in the consensus of the generality of mankind, is sufficiently unambiguous to bestow upon them an unquestioned objective status. This is so despite the fact that there are blind and deaf people who cannot in themselves apprehend such objectivity. Physical science, con- sidering colours and sounds in their actual character as subjective, will have nothing to do, except by structural function, with the red glow of the sunset or the feel of the velvet (to use Whitehead's illustrations), or any of those aesthetic experiences which we en- counter in daily life. All such things are discarded in favour of a spatio-temporal or mathematical domain. Multi-phased Nature, as it throbs in harmony with the senses and inner responses of the spirit, becomes but a boisterous scene of electrons, protons, positrons, neutrons-a field of wave functions, or a chart of world-lines! Why this slaughter? It simply means that the pursuit of science involves a temporary abstraction from that aspect of Nature which holds the ordinary amenities. It does not destroy the validity of these amenities. But our present inquiry concerns the principles of procedure. Let it be said again that science does not come in like a foreign dictator and impose entirely new principles, but it selects from, emphasizes, and makes consistent certain concrete elements and elements of procedure that are implicit in, and necessary to, all objectivizing, even in our individual world. Science is certainly thorough and drastic. A dominant principle employed is generality. The degree of objectivity is always dependent upon the number of viewpoints that are concerned with, and cohere in, the object in question. Thus, as was pointed out, differentiation of subjectivity from objectivity commences when a single mind moves away from a single point of outlook. It is then that a succession of aspects are consolidated in the notion of an external object. The greater the number of consistently sustained aspects, the surer and more stead- fast the object becomes. For example, bodily pains have an un- doubted measure of objectivity to the individual, but they are deemed subjective because their occurrences and recurrences are not consistently related to the more insistent environment of the perceptive domain: they are occasional intruders rather than members of a stable system. There are thus degrees of objectivity, and borderland cases occur. The rainbow is barely rescued from being an illusion by the fact that a contiguous crowd of people agree more or less as to its position, but the man who seeks the pot of gold at its terminal point is apt to explode the objective theory. A constellation, like 72</page><page sequence="6">THE STATUS OF PHYSICAL CONCEPTS the Southern Cross, has a much better status, for it is there for inspection by all mankind when the view is unobstructed by the solid earth, clouds, or competitive glares. Yet to inhabitants of a distant star system it would be non-existent as a cross even if the individual stars could be seen. These uncertainties are not dependent upon mere ambiguities of speech. The same principle applies all through the world of objectivity. From the viewpoint of an electron a brick, with its galaxy of atoms floating in space, would be much of the same character as a constellation to us: inversely, to a being of cosmic proportions, our Milky Way might be a very definite con- cretion. Again, to a blind or colour-blind population, what would become of the red glow of the sunset? We see then that while objec- tivity in some form is inherent in all worlds, the form it assumes is contingent upon viewpoint and instruments of perception. Another principle, which is yet but an extension of the striving towards generality, is that of conservation or invariance. To show that this conception is related to the larger one of generality it is necessary to bring in the analogy between space and time, which has exercised so much the minds of modern physicists. An object is constituted by the generality of its appearances; that is to say, if all observers are agreed upon the occurrence of a certain appearance, universal testimony will insist on its objectivity, and such verdict is difficult to assail. Science requires a generality in time standpoint as well as a generality in space standpoint, and objects which dis- solve away have not fundamental relevance. A block of ice in the ordinary interpretation is undoubtedly an object, with spatial boundaries sharply defined for all observers at the given time. But, as it melts away along the time line, there is a very fuzzy termina- tion to its existence. So in greater or less degree with all material objects that we see or handle. Not only a block of ice but a block of wood, a piece of glass, the pyramids, the earth, the sun, our galaxy of stars itself, would appear to a group of observers strung along the time dimension as variable indeterminate objects, fading away in the extremities to non-entities. Science, therefore, must find a set of objects which better withstand the test of time. It has sought such in the atom, but scarcely found it. Clerk-Maxwell, in a famous passage which reads strangely in the light of modern knowledge, wrote concerning the atom: Natural causes, we know, are at work, which tend to modify, if they do not at length destroy, all the arrangements and dimensions of the earth and the whole solar system. But though in the course of ages catastrophes have occurred and may yet occur in the heavens, though ancient systems may be dissolved and new systems evolved out of their ruins, the molecules out of which these systems are built-the foundation stones of the material universe -remain unbroken and unworn. 73</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY Hence arose the law of the conservation of matter and later the conservation of energy. Can such laws be called empirical, or are they man-imposed? Bertrand Russell has said that the great generalities of physics are much of the character of the "great law" that there are three feet in every yard! Conservation is a notion, essential to science and therefore it is sure to appear in a scientific scheme. Why? Because it serves the primal purpose and charter of science, namely, power of prediction, with control as a corollary. In ordinary life, no doubt, prediction and control are likewise essential, and therefore also some form of conservation. You simply cannot predict without some constant link between the present and the future. If the fact of the future were absolutely different from that of the present, prediction would have no terms in which to express itself. The conservation in the individual and common-sense world is, however, limited, because prediction, although very important, is not the exclusive, or even the paramount, consideration. We live in the present, and, moreover, the present derives its interest and vitality, not from conservation, but from novelty. A universal con- servation would be a universal death. Thus we find that the world of our individual experience is a perpetual excursion into novelty while, as objectification becomes more definite in the passage to the common-sense world and onward to the world of science, so does the ambit of conservation expand and that of novelty diminish. The conservation in the primary worlds is not necessarily of the same kind as that in the scientific world. For instance, we ordinarily consider a river to remain identical, although to science the enduring molecules which constitute its waters pass away out to sea. And so with other things. Something has already been said about the radical variations in the world that can arise from varying viewpoints, and also from diverse organs and instruments of perception. The atomic and cosmic viewpoints were mentioned, and the assumed non-existence of atomic or cosmic observers does not vitiate these illustrations, for physics in its widest aims, is at liberty to embrace all viewpoints, whether occupied by conscious beings or not. Development of this thought must be preceded by enunciation of a thesis which is central to this discussion. It is, that neither the world of common sense nor the varying world of a progressive science is delivered directly to sensory experience. This may seem a rather startling statement to any who may not have given the subject critical thought; for is it not the glory of science that it is founded upon observation and experiment? Yet who has ever experienced an object as it is considered to exist in Nature? Our impressions really form a succession of aspects. I see the outside of a house to-day, and 74</page><page sequence="8">THE STATUS OF PHYSICAL CONCEPTS to-morrow I may go in and view the interior. Thus the unitary and steadfast house of the spatial world turns out to be "given" as a moving panorama, the components of which are separated in time and diluted with an indefinite amount of intermediate ex- perience. And this always is, and must be, the case, even if we set ourselves to concentrate on a single thing, whether it be a lump of wood, an electron, an ether wave, or anything else. It follows, then, that Nature considered as objective is a structure of our selective and abstractive faculties. This point must be examined more closely, because if it is not fully realized, or if it is misunderstood, the remarks that are to follow will be only so many empty words. It may mitigate the somewhat abstract character of the subject if we imagine a man with eyes like a cinema camera, with sound- recording ears, and with the other senses likewise provided with analogous instruments. As he passed through life, moving hither and thither, his whole sensory experience would be recorded in a series of film elements. It is plain that any one of these single film pictures would not contain an object in its full character, but only a casual aspect of it. Nor would the whole film composed of the separate elements have significance until projected and synthesized by a spectator. This is exactly the case with the chain of our sensory impressions: it has no significance apart from the constructive inter- pretations of the mind. These impressions are in themselves abso- lutely separate with no principle by which one can participate with the other in a common life. The Italian philosopher Gentile, in an article published recently under the title "Time in History," shows how history and physical Nature are together involved in this pre- dicament of being disjointed movements save under the synthesis of some covering and unifying principle of interpretation supplied by the mind. Speaking of the common notion of a world of objects complete in themselves, with mind simply standing over against them, he says: "Common sense to escape being driven at the mercy of unbridled imagination over the boundless region of abstract thought puts its trust blindly in a hypothetical world of objects, but such a trust is destined to lure it helpless into a labyrinthine series of facts and objects without logical connection or kinship of the spirit which strives to catalogue them. For facts have no order or connection, even in a mechanical order, which is not derived from the system in which the synthesis of consciousness represents them. . .. The belief in facts becomes an atomistic theory which is essentially the negation of any order or system. ... As facts pile up before the anxious gaze of the researcher there creeps over him a sense of helpless mystery."I Something of the same sort may have been envisaged by Goethe when he wrote: Essays Presented to Ernst Cassirer. Oxford, Clarendon Press, I936. 75</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY And all that flows unfixed and undefined In glimmering phantasy before the mind, Bid thought's enduring chain for ever bind. (Faust-Tr. ANSTER). Upon the cinema illustration hinge certain inquiries and perhaps reservations; for, in addition to sense perception, the mind has an inward eye of memory, so that every member of the whole train of preceding film elements projects its contents upon each new momentary record, the mingled aggregate being thus personal and unique, and not solely dependent upon the immediate sensory situation. In the case of the mind, moreover, all accretions of imagination and impulse may be carried forward in perpetuity under conditions studied by psychology. Physics has to do with the spatio-temporal deliverance of the senses. Keeping the main thesis in view, however, it will be noted that we have the raw material of the individual pictures on the one hand, and the elaboration by selective abstraction and construction on the other, resulting in Nature as we know it by common sense or science-for an analogy in method holds for all interpretations. A question will obtrude itself here: Have we then unlimited free options as to the character of the Nature which shall emerge as we vary our constructional policy or methods? The extreme cases would be illus- trated by regarding Nature as presented to us, on the one hand like the jumbled elements of a jig-saw puzzle bound to one pre- determined solution, and, on the other, like a heap of bricks out of which any chosen edifice could be built. Before hazarding a decision on this issue it will be well to examine further the sources of varia- tion in our constructional results. Let us continue, however, along our line of thought by applying this contingent characteristic which we have found in human perceptions to the cinema illustration. The individual pictures themselves, which were figuring as the raw material for the mind architect, turn out on closer examination to be full of subjective elements, and by no means simple or unique. The form of them is contingent upon our physiological organization and instinctive nature, which mould and transform the primitive impressions. In the film picture, although in the visual part a pretty close resemblance holds between the tiny element in the projector and its counterpart on the screen, it is not so in the sound record. This appears on the film as a manifold of shaded components which issue in articulate speech only after projection on a photo- electric cell, the graded impulses from which actuate the sound apparatus. It may be that in similar manner our apparently simple perceptions, as they appear on the screen of the mind, bear only a very remote functional relation to the primitive sense impressions- as is, indeed, suggested by vision, where, for example, two minute 76</page><page sequence="10">THE STATUS OF PHYSICAL CONCEPTS retinal images of a house upside-down appear in perception as one upright structure, totally disparate in its large dimensions. It is difficult to analyse back to elemental sensations, and indeed to do so philosophy must set out from the level of definite perceptions. For our present discussion perhaps the most important factor of variation in our emergent world picture arises from intellectual constructive imagination. Here is to be found the principal agent of physical science both in its systematizing work and in its formu- lation of the questions put to Nature in observation and experiment. Nature must be articulated into such patterns as best provide the keys for understanding and, in a measure, controlling it. The ordinary configurations which dominate everyday life are in science considered of minor importance, and the world is resolved into more significant, if less tangible, elements. Options in the principles of construction not only exist here, but, in contrast with the uni- formity of instinctive urge in the sensory world, by which we mostly agree as to the objects which surround us, a wide divergence of systems has arisen in the realm of physics. Let me offer a few geo- metrical analogies to the progressive simplifications and multiple interpretations of physics. An uninstructed man might be imagined to use very unwieldy methods in surveying a field. Take a parallelo- gram with unequal angles. Our novice might isolate the four triangles contained in the figure when the diagonals are drawn, laboriously compute their areas, and add them together, arriving at the correct total area. If he dealt with many such fields on the same lines he might easily acquire the habit of referring to the four sections of the parallelogram by symbols as if they were separate entities. One day he discovers that against such a parallelogram can be placed a rectangle which may easily be shown to equal it in area. He, there- fore, in subsequent cases of the kind, simply multiplies the base by the altitude and dismisses the triangle entities from his system of thought. As a somewhat different example,I a set of dots may be given in apparently promiscuous distribution. Investigation may then show that all the dots can, by a certain grouping, be absorbed as angular points in right-angled triangles. Of course any other grouping by threes would produce triangles, but probably they would not have an important uniform characteristic. These right- angled triangles, if repeatedly found in fields of dots, would soon acquire a claim to the status of definite entities in the vocabulary of a geometrician dealing with them. Things implicit, although not actually embodied in concrete form, can thus be made manifest by mind, and read into the situation. As a non-geometrical example of the same thing one could imagine a picture like Leonardo's "Last I Professor C. D. Broad has used a similar illustration in a somewhat different context. 77</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY Supper" with the central figure omitted. The mind of the spectator would be almost compelled to supply the want, so meaningless and puzzling would the picture otherwise be. In this sense the figure might be said to be actually depicted. In our perceptive experience we find a bewildering profusion of presentations with which we must deal, not only in the interests of speculation, but in the struggle for daily existence. The necessity for a classification and arrangement which will serve our purposes of economy of thought and action is forced upon us and instinctive urge sets us at the task from birth onwards. Our investigations may, and often do, stop at a point where we have become sufficiently expert to avoid accidents, gain sustenance, communicate with our fellows, and prosecute daily life. It is presumed, however, that such resolution of the elements of experience is still very crude indeed, and scientific investigation proceeds to simpler and more general formulae by which the survey of the presented field moves on towards perfection. Diamonds and charcoal are very different things in the common view, but science unifies them in the atom. So came the resolution of the whole physical world to electro- magnetic elements. This is no prejudice to sciences with special subject-matter, like chemistry, and particularly biology, which are fully entitled to their special concepts and methods as long as they need them. But what- ever special concepts and methods may be employed by biology, the physical components of organisms must be subject to physical laws. Physics will never tolerate the exclusion of anything within the space-time domain from its jurisdiction. If within organisms behaviour inconsistent with known laws takes place, then these laws must be altered to accommodate the new phenomena even if not fully to account for them; just as within a state of a confederation federal laws must be obeyed although supplementary local laws may be imposed. In the light of the position now arrived at it is possible to reflect upon the issue involved as between objectivism and subjectivism. Nature appears to be fairly rigid and self-willed, by no means clay in the hands of the mental potter, and it seems absurd to think that we could, e.g., bark our shins against a constructional ideal or a mathematical principle! I think we must always recognize the actual-the fact of things being what they are and not something else, no matter by what route such actuality has arrived on the arena of experience. I do not think that it matters very much for physics to what transcendental agency we ascribe the arrival, or whether we postulate transcendental agency at all. That is appro- priate to another sphere, although it is true that even physics cannot be purely empirical. In any case it may be convenient to recognize 78</page><page sequence="12">THE STATUS OF PHYSICAL CONCEPTS two contrasted moments in the composition of systems-the con- sciously imposed forms being mental and the basic elements worked upon being physical. Probably there is nothing ultimately deter- minate in this distinction, particularly if we impose upon physics the heavy task of recognizing all possible viewpoints and all possible organs of perception, as well as complete freedom in intel- lectual construction. But we are human beings, and, willy nilly, find our external world moulded for us in large measure, and such moulding, according to genetic explanation, is attributed to the organization of our bodies and minds. Some philosophical physicists, Eddington, for example, claim the widest constructional field for the mind. He says': "There is often a tendency to divide our assertions about the physical world into 'hard facts' and 'theoretical con- jectures.' There is no such separation." And again2: "We have found that where science has progressed the farthest, the mind has but regained from Nature that which the mind has put into Nature. . . . We have found a strange footprint on the shores of the unknown. We have devised profound theories, one after the other, to account for its origin. At last we have succeeded in reconstructing the creature that made the footprint. And lo! it is our own!" I suggested that perhaps it was not of any concern to physics to assign transcendental agency in explaining the world as we find it; but there is a sense in which it is possible to mark off the sub- jective from the objective components. For physics that becomes objective which is inescapable in any particular system of world constructs. There seem to be many such things, because human cognitive nature is common to all of us, and our physiological and psychological organizations are canalized in their operations, and limited by the senses and categories of the mind. It is not signi- ficant for physics whether the concretions which are associated with these canalized forms are attributed to a transcedental personality or to a transcendental material. The realm in which such a difference applies is essentially mystic, and in it we are beyond the application of mundane standards and boundaries. A mystic in an absorbing vision may spasmodically point his hands outwards, and whatever they chance to point to may serve as a symbol for the inexplicable. Appropriate symbols are important, no doubt, for metaphysics and religion, but they have no relevance for physics. Objectivity will vary in degree according to the proportion of automatic agency deemed operative in the task of delineating the scientific world. Co-relative with this, and supplementary, is an extensive margin under the play of optional thought, and within this margin is supplied the subjective element. Philosophy, January 1933. X Space, Time and Gravitation. 79</page><page sequence="13">PHILOSOPHY The distinction between objective and subjective, although variable in differing contexts, is thus given an intelligible foundation. The metaphysical reality is ignored because it has no relevance. This must not be considered an agnostic or defeatist attitude, any more than would be the case if a mathematician were to decline to describe the taste of a triangle. Nor is there any justification for discussing probabilities regarding the pure metaphysical real within the context of the empirical: for probability means nothing if no test to determine presence or absence can be applied. If a test be established, then, ipso facto, the metaphysical loses its character and the entity itself may come within the domain of physical or other empirical science. The illustration of the dots and triangles as previously presented may help in a further critical consideration of this immediate question. The dots themselves may be taken to represent the "given," and therefore in that context they are undoubtedly objective. The constructed triangles may be thought to inhere in the relative position of the dots; but that is scarcely a definitive character, for many alternative constructions are possible, e.g., the circumscribed circles might be more significant in some contexts. Therefore these optional constructions may be regarded as subjective. This distinc- tion, however, is not absolute, because one may imagine the dots to have been produced, for example, by an engraving process, revealing themselves on close inspection as a multiplicity of minute lines. These lines could in turn become the objective elements, and the dots would then appear as constructs. The aggregation into dots, although natural to our sensory habits, would not be inevitable in itself. Aside from our sensory bias, there is involved (rather more subtly) that intellectual assumption of the special coherence attach- ing to contiguous elements, which reason could scarcely substantiate if the matter were brought in question. In this manner the sub- jective realm can invade the objective, and the frontier is not absolute, but dependent upon the sensory and intellectual system dominant in any particular occasion. That variable anthropomorphic considerations enter into a deter- mination of reality is thought by some philosophers to be derogatory to the sublime detachment of a higher sphere; but it is difficult to imagine any significance for us attaching to anything totally un- connected with our nature. Moreover, what has been said does not imply that one assignment of objectivity is as good as another. A useful analogy with a pair of similarly variable terms may be given. It is certainly not a meaningless distinction that is made between coastal districts and interior districts in a continent. A crab would probably draw the line of distinction at a few yards from the edge of the water, while a seagull might consider as coastal a strip ex 8o</page><page sequence="14">THE STATUS OF PHYSICAL CONCEPTS tending a score or so of miles inland. From time to time these limits would doubtless be transcended, but a reasonable norm as between coastal and interior could be established, based upon the constitution and habits of the respective creatures. So with man: the norm of objectivity is determined by the more or less fixed character of the senses while, as regards the critical intellect, this norm can be varied and indefinite according to the universe of discourse. It might be possible to imagine a being who could vary his sense reception over a wide range, as indeed we do to some extent with instrumental aids such as the microscope and telescope. In such cases the subjective domain would be indefinitely extended and the objective diminished. On the other hand, if the intellect were more inflexibly fixed and canalized, like our sense organs, Nature would become definitely objective, thought being more or less a sinecure without range of selectivity. Hudibras, the prodigy of Samuel Butler's satire, had a mind something of this sort: His notions fitted things so well That which were which he could not tell, And oftentimes mistook the one For th'other, as great clerks have done. Could such perfection be counted as a blessing? It would merge with instinct or intuition, which dispense with laborious mechanism of thought, although at the sacrifice of that turmoil of speculation and striving which seem to constitute the essence of our life. Law, object, and cause are important and related concepts in physics. Law is essential, not incidental, to Nature. To bring forth the heavens and earth out of chaos is virtually to create them; for chaos, although imperfectly conceived as a tumbling jumble of ele- ments, must in the fullness of its meaning cancel all entity, which necessarily implies some trace of system and order. It is easy to see how a complete system of natural law would determine the corre- lated objects, because it would prescribe the orbits of all particles, and consequently their aggregations. No doubt very many laws, particularly minor ones, are objective and inherent in Nature in a dominant degree. Others, the great mathematical laws like those of universal conservation, are subjective or man-imposed. Thus the variability in the objective versions of Nature as a whole, assigned by science from time to time, is accounted for. Nor need there be any finality in this direction. Cause has usually been regarded as having reference to succession, the cause preceding the effect, but the idea could be generalized and extended to the co-existent in space-to say nothing of the future causing the present or the past. The nature of a curve, for example, 8I F</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHY could be cited as the cause of a generated figure. In a penetrating article written for Swiss publication in 1934,' Professor Lauwerys developed this thought in a most interesting manner. He does not, however, use the word cause in a general sense such as I have indi- cated. The general principle is the Uniformity of Nature which is applied as geometry in spatial relations, and as causation in temporal successions. Now, in a mechanical problem, such as the trajectory of a bullet, it is usual to compress time as it were, so that the whole course of the bullet is shown as a simultaneity in a curve. Actually, of course, the bullet is only in one place at a time; but the con- tinuous representation in a curve enables the flight to be dealt with analytically. This ruse, however, is not practicable in more complex physical phenomena such as an application of a light and a conse- quent explosion. It is necessary in such cases to invoke causation proper, which, Lauwerys points out, always involves the atomization of phenomena, for a cause must be individualized. This introduces two diverse and incompatible methods of dealing with Nature, and the result is the dilemma expressed in the Heisenberg Principle of Uncertainty, which asserts that it is impossible to know at once both the position and the momentum of an electron. You can choose which you wish to know, but once the choice is made there is a com- plete and systematic uncertainty as to the other element. This appears to be simply the result of applying simultaneously two not perfectly compatible systems of thought. Owing to the option always offered in constructing Nature as viewed by science, it is apt to happen (often most subtly and elu- sively) that two systems are employed in a single argument, and hence we have many paradoxes comparable with those of Zeno the Greek, who held that motion is an illusion, because a body, in occupying all the intermediate positions, infinite in number, between two points, and spending any time whatever at each, would require an eternity to attain its destination. Similar confusion in a more obvious way was exhibited by the student who, in answer to an examination question as to whether he could give an example of an effect preceding the cause, instanced a man pushing a barrow. Or that other famous answer, that a circle has two sides, the inside and the outside. An illustration, certainly imperfect, of the Heisenberg dilemma might be found in the two diverse methods of indicating a geographical position, (a) by longitude and latitude, and (b) by pricking a mark on a map. The mark would of necessity be of a finite size, and so it would be to that extent indefinite for statement by precise numerals-and vice versa. Much of what has been said may seem formal and likely to be barren in practical science, but it is highly important that clear Annales Gilebhard-Severine. 82</page><page sequence="16">THE STATUS OF PHYSICAL CONCEPTS ideas of scientific method and its relation to metaphysical ideas should be formulated. Confusion has reigned in high places. For example, the Heisenberg Principle has raised violent controversies regarding the validity of the principle of causation. Now, if it be definitely and consciously realized that a double system of thought is applied to a problem no harm is likely to accrue. Indeed, multiple systems have often proved useful and supplementary, and perhaps they may be ultimately essential to science. But it is a different matter to assign as an indefeasible character of Nature what is merely the result of a particular chosen method of analysis. Failure to distinguish between the individual world and the common domain of science has, it would seem, been responsible for the attempts of Sir A. Eddington to impose free will on Nature. Free will has to do with the individual world, and should never be argued (as such) on the plane of the very different world of physics, which excludes by its very procedure not only free will, but the whole vital colour of life. The knowledge of free will is in no way dependent upon undetermined electrons. It is an immediate intui- tion, of a higher truth status than the derivative realm of physics. In any case Eddington's freedom does not amount to much. The writer had an opportunity of asking him a question at a philo- sophical Congress in Cambridge. Premising that physical laws with suitable transformation can be applied backwards, as when ancient eclipses are determined, it was suggested that on his showing the past must be indetermined in a similar manner to the future. He replied in effect "Yes, except in so far as the past is actually known from experience." Now, what an infinitesimal part of the past has entered into actual experience, and most of that is long forgotten! The most unbending determinist would surely be satisfied to believe that the future is as definite as the unknown past. We cannot live backwards (Eddington elsewhere emphasizes): but physical laws can be interpreted either backwards or forwards. However, he finds an exceptional anomaly in the second law of thermodynamics. Energy, although always the same in amount in a closed system, must perpetually degenerate in form. To take a figurative illustration, a viscous column of, say, bitumen, could retain its constant weight although gradually collapsing from tall and thin to short and stout, and eventually spreading like a pan- cake on the ground. Eddington suggested that the constant de- generation of energy creates the inviolable onward flow of time. But surely this would involve a wholly anomalous backward flow of time in restricted regions where, as of course is admitted, energy can, by drawing upon neighbouring sources be boosted for the time being in an upward direction. But the whole conception ignores the fact that the adventure of 83</page><page sequence="17">PHILOSOPHY mind in time is a matter of the individual world, in which context time is not space-like at all (as Bergson's philosophy has emphatically proclaimed). It is, therefore, not directional in the spatial sense, unless, indeed, it be a genetic prototype of the spatial concept. Certainly it is not as a citizen in the space world. Would we expect distinction between "here" and "there" in the universe of science? Yet these concepts are vital to the individual. The abstractive domain of physical Nature is like a map or index. It is not accounted as a blemish in a chart that it does not show pictures of individual ships, or that it can show the way on to the rocks as well as the way to avoid them. The index is not identical with the contents of a book! Doubtless it will have been noticed that I have followed in a general sense the Kantian interpretation of Nature. But modern physics has gone beyond Kant, who held that space and time in their native character were unassailable foundations of thought. If so, they have shared the fate of the sensory qualities of the common-sense world; or have at best been admitted to the world of physics in a mutilated condition. The relativity theory and other theories have brought these background entities out into the arena of manipulative calculation along with the matter which occupies them. Indeed, the ideal is to whittle away content and express the Universe as a general configuration upon a spatio-temporal domain, in which mathematical character overrides intuitive simplicity.I Einstein has set the ball rolling, and there is no end in recent cosmic theories to the liberties being taken with the space and time concepts. De Sitter, the eminent Dutch mathematical astronomer, suggested the necessity of different time systems for the occupied and unoccupied regions of space respectively. Later still, E. A. Milne, who for some years past has been a pro- minent figure among English cosmologists, goes much further than Einstein. He alludes to the fact that owing to the abolition of abso- lute time evolution has lost its meaning, but concerns himself mainly with devising a character for a universe capable of fitting moder theory, particularly as to conflicting elements of time. The famous second law of thermodynamics, which implies the doom of the Universe by the running down of effective energy, is itself nugatory unless a specification be given of the particular time system to be applied. Many cosmologists now regard the Universe as ex- panding in such sort that a commencement to the expansive pro- cess seems to point to original creation. Milne embodies this con- ception, and his Universe comes out as one in which a leading thought is a diverse time system for each constitutent world in the Universe, so that each, while growing old and running down in Cf. Cassirer's Substance and Function. 84</page><page sequence="18">THE STATUS OF PHYSICAL CONCEPTS energy level, may look back to a real creation epoch. Not only that, but the inhabitants of any ageing world will always be able to envisage within the Universe other equally real worlds in whose time system creation is an affair of yesterday. This, in the opinion of Milne, can reconcile creation, degradation of energy, and eternal duration. One more aspect of time in Nature. Time systems are ultimately derived from physical law, but physical law aims at being itself timeless or permanent. Is this a modem version of the Parmenidean quest, endemic in the human breast, to reach out of the flux which is the mother of Time to pure Being which is one and for ever stable. It is not possible on this occasion to discuss Nature as the bridge between mind and mind, but it may be suggested that the bridge having become so wobbly, the validity of the communication between spirit and spirit seems to come in question-a far-reaching thought. In conclusion it may be hoped that one practical deduction can be drawn from this review of the status of physical concepts. The Nature of physics is a purposive abstraction from experience, intensely meaningful, but not an epitome, let alone an embodiment, of all reality. Things with which we have immediate contact in experience cannot be cancelled or contradicted by an elaboration of theory. The world of physics may hold the keys to the mansion, but the keys are not the mansion; nor is a map of the world, however useful, identical with the great globe itself. 85</page></plain_text>
