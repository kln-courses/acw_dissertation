<plain_text><page sequence="1">EMILY GROSHOLZ Poetry Chronicle THE CRITIC'S DILEMMA THESE DAYS is that the very criteria of judgment are themselves choosable. At the very least, then, we should try to make clear the basis on which we dismiss or admire books of poetry. In the ini- tial part of this Chronicle, I would like to criticize a certain strain of con- temporary American poetry, referring to works by three poets, perhaps unfairly singled out, since they are no worse and probably better than many of their peers; here my argument depends only on a few simple ob- servations concerning the English language and A. J. Ayer. Further on, I will offer more principled grounds of judgment to explain my admiration for a variety of poetry books which have recently appeared. Consider the following selections: from "Sparrows," by Bruce Weigl' Yes it was raining the day we wrecked the convertible. I pretended to sleep while you led us home across a large body of water. You must have carried me or pulled me on my back by my chin- I can float but can't swim. I woke at your father's house. -from "Late Morning," by John Allman2 So I do not get up. I avoid myself, sheathed in blankets like an Indian woman. I roll over, an old drunk, I hear myself breathing the deep, stertorous dreams in which I succeed, saying, "Nothing matters." -and from "The Blind Man," by Carl Dennis- I don't need this blindness to remind me. For a long time my backbone curved to hospitals. I'm familiar with the bone wards. No need for all my papers and pencils To fall dark. Did I ever pretend My sentences had saved anything?

Its world-view, if it has one, is a kind of soft phenomenalism, for it is the logical conjunction of sense-data statements, brief reports of the immediate sensory experience of a subject. Forty years ago A. J. Ayer hoped that such conjunction would eventually add up to reports about the world, and these poets seem to share this hope; but it has long been dashed by philosophers with, god knows, no particular stake in poetry. Why would a poet wish to run so perversely counter to the English lan- guage which is, first of all, rich in hypotactic devices? One suggestion is that parataxis leaves transitions ambiguous, thus inviting the reader to take more active part in the construction of the sense of the poem. How- ever, in these poems the sequence is that of a private dream; not even the phenomenalist-poet seems to know why the sentences proceed as they do. Thus parataxis is a tease, and the reader can only fail in his construals. Secondly, English also provides abundant resources for perspectival play among tenses and persons. Neglect of these is, I suspect, an attempt to give the poem more immediacy, perhaps for enhanced emotional im- pact. These poems are immediate, but in the phenomenalist sense of ex- pressing what is experienced prior to all inference. Unfortunately, at this level it is impossible to distinguish between reality and hallucination. (Thus the diction, though spare, is never chaste, for the conflation of real- ity and dream generates a slew of shifting figures.) The objective realm is attained only upon imaginative detachment from the subjective "I," when we hypothesize, entertain "contrary-to-fact conditionals," take on another point of view: in fact, indulge in subordination, the third person, the pluperfect, the subjunctive! No one can fail to be moved by reality and the imagination at work in it; but the swivel-eye of immediacy, lim- ited and egotistical, is cold: and so much for emotional impact. Parataxis, the lyric "I," temporal foreshortening, are all effective when carefully employed, but as invariable components of this sadly wide- spread style, they amount to a literary mannerism which should be dropped. Galileo, a poet in his youth, abandoned poetry for the project of mathe- matical physics. Descartes, preliminary to introducing his mechanical/ mathematical methode, argued that we might as well make ourselves famil- iar with the histories and fables of the ancients, in order to avoid being misled by them. Ever since the locus of truth shifted over to the scientists (Galileo and Descartes on the machines of nature, Hobbes and Locke on the social machine), honest poets have had to wonder about the peculiar status of their song: why go on singing? Holderlin's famous question, Wozu Dichter in diirftiger Zeit?, is prompted by the misgiving that perhaps poetry had a function only in the good old tribal days, when Man, Na- ture and the Gods were one, and poets could plausibly claim divine in- spiration for themselves and truth for their utterances. The standard I propose for judging contemporary poetry is just this:</page><page sequence="3">EMILY GROSHOLZ anachronism is useless. Poets who think they sing "to restore this lost unity and to reconcile natural with supernatural, visible with invisible" (as Keeley and Sherrard characterize the poetry of Sikelianos, discussed below) attempt the impossible. Direct appeal to myth, animism, the old unities, betrays a lack of intelligence and nerve. However, I am far from claiming that poetry no longer serves a pur- pose. The scientific world-view, insofar as it is (archaically) unreflective, puts us in an absurd position, out of history and out of nature. The lu- minous cogito, to whom the machines of nature are both transparent and alien, and the reasoner who forges the social contract independent of par- ticular customs and traditions, that is, of the past, offer a doom as restrict- ive as the old unity they attempted to break. Wozu Dichter? Look around: in a public, shareable way, poets are car- rying out a much-needed reflection on our relation to the past and to na- ture, and on our (thankfully no longer tribal) social unities. Those who repudiate modernity, by trying to restore the mantic role of the poet, sim- ply cannot be taken seriously. The best poets do play upon the archaic functions of poetry within the monolithic world it once governed, but al- ways with an affectionate or bitter irony-for they see that the truth it claimed was never absolute anyway, but a cultural achievement, like sci- ence. And their writing exhibits the virtues characteristic of the modern era: the ability to improvise, to entertain, suspend or revise judgment, and to regard what is offered as a foundation as, instead, a problem-a prob- lem which must be taken up and solved again and again. Eleanor Wilner's first book, Maya,4 is a particularly fine example of such poetry. The poems are in general rather long, but their texture never thins, rewarding the intensest scrutiny. Even more striking than their sur- face beauty is the deep thoughtfulness which informs them, guiding the reader as a stream or pathway runs from one border to the other in a scroll of, say, Wang Meng, whose works are dynamic, orderly and crowded. It is difficult to disentangle a few lines from the whole, but the following passage from "Love Uncommanded" is representative: Extraordinary. Our friends, the skeptics, who are ourselves, such an extravagance of feints, the perfectly spun glass, exquisite complications, saying they know that they know nothing, the oldest ruse. Let it go. Say what you know. For once, be rid of the urn with beauty chased in half-relief, the urn with the false bottom, the ancient goad to truth-the right word turned exactly on itself.

University of Massachusetts Press. $8.00. 295</page><page sequence="4">THE HUDSON REVIEW Wilner's aversion to the lyric "I" ("After all/ these years of hating/ the first person singular, the one rent/ in the good fabric ...") turns her to narrative, myths retold and parables invented for our troubled occasions. All kinds of strange and strangely recognizable figures populate her sto- ries: Pharaoh's daughter (Moses' corruptor), Iphigenia (alive and well in a little village), Henry Adams' wife (a fine repose in stone); as well as more indefinite types which poet and reader can use as their mirror, the dead man in the parachute, the retired diamond cutter, the monkey-man climbing the beanstalk of spine to the grey clouds of the brain, that coun- try where giants (who are they?) taunt and comfort him. Or, in "The Illu- minator," the monk who admits: We are the scribes of the unacknowledged world, illuminators of the books we torture with profusion: with foliage, flowers, beasts and saints in strange positions. and feels responsible when he sees a cross in a peasant's garden, two bound sticks which, because they are so choked in vines and flowers, re- mind him of his "T"s. That's why I went tonight to see that farmer-knocked on his door and said to him: forgive me. He stared at me in dumb dismay and shook because I seemed a holy man, and mad, to him- a little man in a frayed robe, gold-spattered, with paint stains on his fingers, apologizing for what he couldn't know had never mattered. Throughout the book, Wilner's discourse traces the isomorphisms be- tween the poet's illuminated manuscript ("the language/ made by puncturing/ the page, letting in/ the light"), her own skin ("indelibly marked/ with sun and shade: in safety, ornament;/ in danger, cam- ouflage"), and nature affirmed as "the veil of maya" where everything is close to everything, the stars hang among the woven branches of the trees, the moon is a lantern overgrown with leaves. Unlike the abstracted mystic who tries to see past maya and succeeds only in seeing nothing, Wilner wants to acknowledge the intricacy, the pro- fusion, the thicket of the world, as well as the line of thought threaded through it. The genius of modernity is our enhanced ability to acknowledge and control natural contingency: disease, weather, scarcity; but the great un- certainty, death, remains unaltered in the slightest by all our cultural re- sourcefulness. Poems dealing with death can be taken as a touchstone, 296</page><page sequence="5">EMILY GROSHOLZ 297 then, for precisely here we are most tempted to "ritual avoidance," telling tales that transform (mortal) chance to (divine) necessity. It seems we can't help talking about the dead; indeed, given how many elegies are de- livered in the second person, we can't help talking to the dead. Yet, just as we cannot leave a death uninterpreted and meaningless, the desire for some univocal construction is anachronistic. The civil war in Ireland has laid a patina of senseless violence over var- ious important political issues (legitimacy, domination, poverty) and the already enigmatic fact of death. It is not surprising that Seamus Heaney's latest book, Field Work,' includes half a dozen elegies where the expression of loss is woven with a sense of ambiguity, political, moral and personal. In "The Strand at Lough Beg," Heaney mourns his cousin, Colum McCartney, murdered under circumstances left unexplained, on a high- way far from home: Along that road, a high, bare pilgrim's track Where Sweeney fled before the bloodied heads, Goat-beards and dogs' eyes in a demon pack Blazing out of the ground, snapping and squealing. What blazed ahead of you? A faked road-block? The red lamp swung, the sudden brakes and stalling Engine, voices, heads hooded and the cold-nosed gun? The myth (Sweeney is the hero of a Middle Irish prose and poem se- quence, the Notes tell us), set in apposition as a bit of regional lore, con- veys brilliantly the horror and mystery of the murder, its inhumanity. Heaney ends the stanza with a transition back to Lough Beg, where he and his cousin grew up, and begins the next in their childhood, when the spent cartridges of hunter's guns unsettled them, sprung from a family who "Spoke an old language of conspirators/ And could not crack the whip or seize the day." He imagines them both walking across their strand, in an artificial time suspended between childhood and a different version of the recent past: I turn because the sweeping of your feet Has stopped behind me, to find you on your knees With blood and roadside muck in your hair and eyes, Then kneel in front of you in brimming grass And gather up cold handfuls of the dew To wash you, cousin. Few elegies are at once so brutal, beautiful and sad. The poet speaks to the dead man, dead even in the imagined scene of the poem; why is apostrophe fitting and indeed inevitable here?

For there is no suggestion that the poet believes the dead are not dead; and surely the ear of a dead man is no longer an ear. Here, I believe, is neither anachronism nor self-delusion, but only a genuine paradox. Field Work as a whole is far from being overshadowed by the question of death; the question of life is also answered and answered again, particu- larly in a series of lovely, unsentimental and very moving poems to the poet's wife. The title poem ends: Mould blooms and pigments the back of your hand like a birthmark- my umber one, you are stained, stained to perfection. The poem which forms the centerpiece of Pamela Stewart's second book, Cascades," was written for (and, again, addressed to) a murdered friend. Towards the end of "Harvest," she takes up the puzzle of direct address: Thousands of words are being found for you. They Touch the air between our hearts and paper, And as they do Will you be there to hear them? Her answer is too simple: she'll go on talking to her dead friend, serving as a conduit between her and the world, in order to let her know what's going on in the lives of those she loved. That night when the mothers Drive hooded, ghostly children from door To door, whiskey flasks between their pretty knees To keep off the cold, I'll let you know How shadows fall and that everything you care for Still touches you, and whoever loves you, also! Throughout this long, complexly narrated poem, Stewart has made a strong case for the irrationality and injustice of her friend's murder; so 6 CASCADES, by Pamela Stewart.

Still, it loses force precisely because it is so naive, as if the dead could be comforted like children. In this respect, the final poem of the collection, "For February's Dark Simple," where Stewart reflects on the naive stories we tell children about death, which children ultimately see through, is deeper and more effec- tive. How, all these years, Tucking the white quilt around you was A white lie, how the largest feelings Force us to know We're really all alone. Even now, while the desert That circles this town is eating rain, Its terrible rim of mountains can shoot To color. You're eight years old, curled up In a gold chair, furious And sad at all the sadness-even as We bring it on ourselves. The key poem in Howard Moss's latest volume7 is "Elegy for My Sis- ter," a distinguished piece of writing, deeply felt and beautifully struc- tured. It opens by asking, why should we wake the dead by addressing them? Why not let them sleep in our own forgetfulness? Why torture myself? or you?-sailed into The port of Nothing, or that Elysium Of childish happiness the heart sets store by, Which, for you, would be a house in Larchmont, Or the first time you arrived in Paris. Thus the figure of the poet's sister is introduced, and with such wry sym- pathy she continues to develop throughout the poem, moving in and out of the present, where she is lost, the recent past, where she is ill, and her girlhood, where she appears as amateur pianist, romantic, and schoolgirl in the city. What errors you made you made in wanting To be warm again or held or human And not for the wolf of cash, or the mean, Sloe-eyed beauty of power or the game Of the wily outwitting the unaware, Or simulated pain used as a lure.

Atheneum. $10.00. 299</page><page sequence="8">THE HUDSON REVIEW trope, which in turn the poet uses to develop his own meditation upon ill- ness and the way it moves those we love towards death. A barge passes, whose scruffy captain we recognize at the end as Charon; the opening bridge, like a diseased body, "is ever so slightly/ Tearing a suture of itself in secret;/ And what is most feared is about to happen." But our disintegrating orders are orderings nonetheless, and the one- sided love we retain for the absent is still love. A philosophical passage to- wards the end of the poem, abstract but not cold, brings together all of the poem's figures and reflections: What are ideas but architecture Taking nature to heart and sustaining Inviolable forms: the fleur-de-lis, The subtle acanthus, the shell-like dominions Of diamond accretions royal on coal, The Gothic tower and the rabbit warren, The fine interchange of matter and matter, The natural and social shifting in the bonds Of dialogues and elegies that rise from the soil. Notes from the Castle also contains some fine letter-poems, a genre which might be thought obliquely allied to the elegy, since such poems are ad- dressed to friends still living, but absent. "Stars," for James Merrill, re- calls, not only the Ovid of the Metamorphoses whom Moss mentions there, but the poet who wrote the Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto from exile, re- flecting on friendship, its basis in a shared past and its ability to survive separation and change. Richard Hugo's letter-poems appear towards the end of his Selected Poems," culled from his book 31 Letters and 13 Dreams. These letters, written mostly to other poets from various western locations ("Letter to Kizer from Seattle") are wise and moving meditations on friendship, place, dis- placement and poetry. They are far superior to the dream-poems which accompany them; most dreams, as such, have no natural public content, and I find these recountings unintelligible. The letter-poems, in contrast, are doubly shareable, for by writing his letters as poems the poet has raised intensely personal communication to statements of universal signif- icance. Thus in "Letter to Levertov from Butte": On the one hand, no matter what my salary is or title, I remain a common laborer, stained by the perpetual dust from loading flour or coal... ... On the other hand, I know the cruelty of poverty, the embittering ways 8 SELECTED POEMS, by Richard Hugo. Norton. $12.95. 300</page><page sequence="9">EMILY GROSHOLZ love is denied, and food, the trival compensation of each day,... ...and I don't want to be part of it. Up to this point, I have considered poetry in its purely social dimen- sion, as a way in which people talk to other people (ceremoniously, pub- licly); but I don't wish to neglect another indispensable function of po- etry, which is to stir and bring into question our sense of the natural world mutely surrounding us. Hugo, in particular, is primarily a pastoral poet, though in a precarious sense of the term, for the nature he broods over is blasted and disjointed. He writes of mill-towns on the reeking, pol- luted rivers of the American Northwest, and of the poor (including most of the remaining Indians) who scratch out a living and drink away their weekends there. The power of his vision is undeniable, as here in "Du- wamish": Midwestern in the heat, this river's curves are slow and sick. Water knocks at mills and concrete plants, and crud compounds the grey. On the out-tide, water, half salt water from the sea, rambles by a barrel of molded nails, gray lumber piles, moss on ovens in the brickyards no one owns. The tribal relation to nature is gone, corrupted or dying in the impover- ished Indians themselves. "Indian Graves at Jocko": A forlorn lot like this, where snow must crawl to find the tribal stones, is more than just a grim result of cheat, Garfield's forgery, some aimless trek of horses from the stolen Bitter Root. Dead are buried here because the dead will always be obscure, wind the one thing whites will always give a chance. Hugo knows this countryside like the back of his (mechanic-poet-fish- erman's) hand, its desolation, its enormity, and he is harshly clear-eyed about the hopelessness of mythical, the viciousness of mechanical, con- structions upon it. Reading through his Selected Poems, I can see that the poet has worked out a separate peace for himself; yet that leaves unsolved the dilemma of how the human figure is to be integrated into the torn landscape. What can a poet do? Dave Smith, in Goshawk, Antelope,9 uses the ele- 9 GOSHAWK, ANTELOPE, by Dave Smith.

In particular, he takes over the totem, that figure which compounds the subhuman, the human, and the divine. In the title poem, he maintains a delicate balance between a playful and serious use of to- temic imagery by emphasizing the tension between the polar terms of his metaphors, and the work of imagination in devising them. The goshawk and antelope, male and female principles, both are Smith's father and mother and are not: for how could such alien creatures be kin? The gos- hawk, for instance, is first presented as entirely Other, in a setting which is at once actual and a landscape of memory, the intense sunlight, long hours of driving, and some past trouble inducing Smith's double vision: he fell across my windshield, a dot at sixty, and I, half- looking for a place I had never seen, half-dreaming rooms where blind miles of light lie on framed family faces, saw him before he was anything, a spot above the glassy road and in my eye, acetylene burned by brightness and hours of passage. Memory and present vision move closer and closer as the poem prog- resses, until at the end they are wholly superimposed: the accusing goshawk face of my father in that dark room where I walked too late, where the glowing fur-tufts of candle shadows drift on her face and his and what was held has become, suddenly, lost like breath. We can accept the totemic identification because it has been prepared so carefully in the poem. The wilderness converges on the poet; the poet's mind is also a wilderness where all his history converges on one moment, in which the totem names, if it does not dissolve, the mystery which drives the poem to its conclusion. Again and again, Smith holds up the human to the nonhuman world, complicating the mirror-images with an ineluctable sense of alienation. On what basis, then, is the sympathetic correspondence asserted-be- tween the woman and the apple tree, lovers and seals, the young boy and the "Hawktree," the pregnant wife and the spider she will not kill? Each poem has its own solution, and the reader must keep going back to them. My only reservation about Smith's poetry is its obscurity, which must partly be due to the enormous difficulty of the themes he has chosen to address, and his refusal to treat them in any simple fashion; still, a poet's failure to communicate is no better than silence.

When Oliver holds to her sense of respectful distance, the poems succeed very well; only when that hold slips do they become too anthropomorphic and sentimental, too much like animal fables. The poet lives in Provincetown and clearly spends a great deal of time outdoors, as one imagines Annie Dillard, covering miles of fields and woods, then halting, motionless, attentive, for hours, "Enter- ing the Kingdom": The dream of my life Is to lie down by a slow river And stare at the light in the trees- To learn something by being nothing A little while but the rich Lens of attention. But the crows puff their feathers and cry Between me and the sun, And I should go now. They know me for what I am. No dreamer, No eater of leaves. The figure of the crows here tells the ambiguity of her position, for they are at once mythologized (as the angel at the gates of Eden) and yet, hav- ing been given a voice, they contradict their own speech, telling her how strange she is within the kingdom, how little entitled to her attributions of discourse. Like the paradox of the liar, the poem swings back and forth, riddling. You could almost use this book as a field guide (and it is entirely a propos to recall here Robert Hass's beautiful Field Guide): surely one func- tion of a poet/naturalist is to tell the reader to go out and look. When we go out just to look we are admittedly tourists, but this guide sometimes self-consciously tries to compensate for the way in which names divide and dismember the wild, and offers as well acute observation: Tossed under the tree The cracked bones Of the owl's most recent feast Lean like shipwreck, starting The long fall back to the center- The seepage, the flowing, The equity: sooner or later In the shimmering leaves The rat will learn to fly, the owl Will be devoured. 303</page><page sequence="12">THE HUDSON REVIEW So oddly inverted is the sense of this last couplet, it reminds us that na- ture's equity is none of ours, even while we cannot help but suspect some delicate balance. The sense of contingency which I have argued a contemporary poet must cultivate in coming to terms with nature, inevitably also gives rise to some awareness of our peculiar historicity. On the one hand, the poet writes out of tradition past (including our present curious custom of pre- tending we don't have one), and on the other hand, none of the tradi- tional solutions will serve, for the problematic, whatever it is, has already been superseded. Donald Justice's Selected Poems'" play variations on the themes of time's passage, mortality, afternoon and autumn. His writing never succumbs to the black despair which corroded the poetry of Weldon Kees (whom he served so well as editor), but is held by a kind of mental equipoise and illusionless wit. It is grave, measured, detached, never cold but breath- takingly formal. I would say that any young American poet must come to Donald Justice's work sooner or later to learn the state of the art, even though he characteristically protests to his students: No more! There has been traffic enough In the bedroom of the muse. A few examples must suffice here to exhibit his concerns and the per- fection of his severely self-selected oeuvre. Often he writes of neighbor- hoods, quiet with the stillness of desolation, anonymous and American: though one senses behind them Baudelaire's Tableaux parisiens, the same charitable attention to the old, the lost, the trapped and dying. For ex- ample, "Bus Stop": And the last bus Comes letting dark Umbrellas out- Black flowers, black flowers. And lives go on.

"A Winter Ode to the Old Men of Lummus Park, Miami, Florida," recalling Baudelaire's "Les Petites Vieilles," concludes: Poor cracked thermometers stuck now At zero everlastingly, Old men, bent like your walking sticks As with the pressure of some hand, Surely we must have thought you strong To lean on you so hard, so long! Dante, Milton, Baudelaire, Rilke, Alberti, Guillevic, haunt the pages of this collection, a recurrence not at all inconsistent with the fact that Jus- tice's landscapes and characters are thoroughly American, and that he rarely treats Europe itself directly. The tacit presence of European culture is what gives substance and resonance to his reflective preoccupation with the past. Anthony Hecht, in The Venetian Vespers,'2 dwells on the European con- nection explicitly. The title poem, a very long narrative, concerns an American who, hounded by a silent crime which wrecked his childhood a posteriori, has come to Venice for refuge and oblivion. Hecht's deployment of the English language can only be described as gorgeous. No chastity here, but sensual and overripe language, as in this description of St. Mark's: Gradually Glories reveal themselves, grave mysteries Of the faith cast off their shadows, assume their forms Against a heaven of coined and sequined light, A splatter of gilt cobblestones, flung grains Or crumbs of brilliance, the vast open fields Of the sky turned intimate and friendly. What this glorious mausoleum will bestow, so the protagonist hopes, is "a moment of unwonted grace" where he can forget himself, and the tor- ment of past and future. Where else but in Venice, where the present is a past gilded, gelded and transfixed by tourist money, isolated from the mainland and slowly sinking? Even the weather invites a trance-like for- getfulness: Blown shawls of rain Quiver and luff, veil the cathedral front In flailing laces where the street lamps hold Fixed globes of sparkled haze high in the air And the black pavement runs with wrinkled gold In pools and wet dispersions... 12 THE VENETIAN VESPERS, by Anthony Hecht. Atheneum. $10.00. 305</page><page sequence="14">THE HUDSON REVIEW The obsessive vision of the American, and Venice itself, provide Hecht with the occasion he needs for a virtuoso display of verbal brilliance. The moral of the tale seems to be that the American promise of oppor- tunity and self-determination was simply a lie; the ancient doom was in full force all along, so that returning to Europe in order to lie down before it is entirely appropriate. If this is not an anachronistic view of things, it is at least a retreat from the complexity of modern vision. Indeed vision, in the book as a whole, takes the form of one ultimate hypnotic moment where the self is lost in looking. The chambermaid in "The Grapes," the wife in "The Short End," and the American dying in Venice all implode as they stare at a vortex of color: a bowl of grapes in water, a carriage lan- tern, a sunset, which have become prisms to collect and focus light for one final, terrible conflagration. I have difficulty with the poetry of both Justice and Hecht because of their unrelenting world-weariness. The same old-world resignation flaws the poetry of George Seferis, whereas in the work of that other mon- umental figure of contemporary Greek letters, Odysseus Elytis, it is tran- scended. Kimon Friar's selection and translation of Elytis' poetry is provided with an extensive and detailed introduction, notes and bibliography, which serve well as a guide through the living pillars of Elytis' forest of symbols. One might quarrel here and there with Friar's selection, and re- gret, for example, that the engaging, modern, cloud-headed Maria Nepheli appeared too late to be included, but in general the book is quite repre- sentative. The naively ecstatic, sensual poetry of Elytis' youth (Orientations, In the Service of Summer, Sun the First) darkens in the poet's maturity with a recog- nition of man's tragic condition and the dislocation of modernity. The Lost Second Lieutenant and Axion Esti are marked by Elytis' experience of the invasion of Greece by Italy and Germany during World War II, and the subsequent civil war. Six and One Remorses for the Sun marks a transi- tion, and with The Light Tree (1971) Elytis is free both of naive mythology and of a despair like Seferis', that the future can never pull itself from the entrails of the past. In The Light Tree, a response to the "problem of nature" develops which is neither a resolution nor a dissolution, but a celebration: a fleeting plunge into the sea/the sun, intimating a mysterious unity which cannot be held nor captured with words. It must be undertaken again and again, for whatever glimpse is possible in our age of reflection is permanently precarious. (Try to fix the vision as a tribal grid of gods and demons, and reflection will instantly disband it; try to hide it behind the screen of sci- ence, and enigmatic nature (laughing wordlessly) will push through with her little green leaves.) In a deliberately open and fluid syntax, Elytis writes "Three Times the Truth": I lived on nothing Only words could not suffice me As a wind passed by and my ears unraveled an unworldly sound fhia fhiou 13 THE SOVEREIGN SUN, by Odysseus Elytis.

Elytis' Archangel is sometimes dressed in the Greek landscape, some- times in the flesh of a young girl, for his plunge into the "altus" is also the act of love, an embodied gymnastic-metaphysic of light which, like love, is always in need of reenactment.

Readers seri- ously interested in Elytis might want to order a selection of his writings in Greek, 'Ekloghi 1935-1977, produced last year by the Greek publishing house AKM2N, which to a certain extent overlaps with Friar's selection. The emblem of Elytis' poetry might be an Ionian kore, smiling, seduc- tive, painted, her hair and chiton wavy as the surface of the sea. Angelos Sikelianos (1884-1951), on the other hand, wrote a severer poetry which can only be described as Doric, reminding one of the western pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, where Apollo stretches his arm calmly above the poised battle between the Lapiths and the Centaurs. Indeed, Elytis is a poet of the islands and the Aegean, Sikelianos of the mainland: Sparta, Corinth, Eleusis, Olympia. Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard have put together a limited but attractive sample of Sikelianos' poetry in translation, flanked by the origi- nal Greek, a brief but illuminating introduction, notes, and schematic chronology.14 Sikelianos' hierophantic poetry, like that of the young Holderlin, borders on the false-archaic, and only when it is tempered by a disillusionment late in coming (during the years preparatory to the sec- ond World War) does it reveal a more modern sensibility. His most priestly poetry strikes one with its barbarity, though perhaps he was play- ing deliberately on the darker chords of traditional culture.

What mitigates the ungentle ritualism in Sikelianos' poetry even from the very beginning is his precise and sensual rendering of the Greek land- scape. In "The First Rain," two lovers look together from a window to see: Sulphur-pale, the clouds darkened the fields, the vines; wind moaned in the trees with a secret turbulence, and the quick swallow went breasting over the grass. Scents "from balsam, pine, acanthus,/ from osier, or thyme" are carefully transformed by the poet into the scent of eros, and the rainstorm, when it falls, into sexual love. In Sikelianos' later poetry, however, he introduces myth only in anal- ogy to episodes or revelations of his own experience, so that we no longer have to assimilate it directly but instead through the filter of the poet's worldly (or, more accurately, earthly) wisdom. His reworking of the Daedelus myth, for instance, is profound indeed: But if a man who from his earliest years has said that the heavens and the earth are one, that his own thought is the world's hearth and center, and that the earth may mingle with the stars as a field's subsoil with its topsoil, so that the heavens too may bring forth wheat such a man will "gird his wings like armor, and climb among the winds." Daedelus' flight is the ascension of thought; he unites heaven and earth because he is brave enough to launch himself between them, animating even the sleepy statues of mankind by reminding them of their mortality. 308</page></plain_text>
