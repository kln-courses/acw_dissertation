<plain_text><page sequence="1">DECCAN COLLEGE MUSEUM: A SPECIALIZED MUSEUM IN ARCHAEOLOGY* SHAHIDA ANS ARI Brief History of the Deccan College The Deccan College has a long, glorious and eventful history for the last 187 years. The word 'Deccan' after which the college is named is associated with the Deccan Plateau, forming the geological foundations of western India. However, it really refers to the donation and gifts given by the Peshwas to the learned community in order to support learning and scholarship. This fund, which was inherited by the British rulers, was used to maintain seat of Hindu learning in Pune. Due to the enlightened outlook of famous administrator Mount Stuart Elphinstone, the then Governor of the Bombay Presidency, and his friendly recommendations and Government approval, Deccan College started as the Hindoo College on 6th October 1821. In 1842, an English School was started and it was run alongside the Hindoo College. In 1851, the Hindoo College and the English School were merged to form the Poona College. In 1864, it was shifted to present campus (spread over 125 acres of land) and renamed as Deccan College in view of its serving the needs of the entire Deccan (Paddayya 2000-2001). It was run by the Presidency Government up to 1934 and was re-opened on 17th August 1939 as a Post-Graduate and Research Institute and the Deemed University status came into effect from the academic year 1994-95. Since 1939, it has become the foremost centre of higher learning and research in Ancient Indian History and Archaeology, Linguistics, Sanskrit Studies, Anthropology- Sociology, Maratha and Medieval History. During the course of time the college has produced many outstanding students who rose to fame later, like Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak (freedom fighter), Sir R.G. Bhandarkar (orientalist), G.G. Agarkar (social reformer), Prof. R.D. Ranade (philosopher), Prof. R.N. Dandekar (sanskritist), N.D. Nagarwala (educationist and sports patron), Appa Pant (diplomat), and others. Department of Archaeology and Deccan College Museum The Department of Archaeology, established and nurtured by the eminent archaeologist, Padma Bhushan H.D. Sankalia, is the largest Department of Archaeology in the country. It has laboratory facilities and expertise in archaeological science disciplines * This paper was presented in National Seminar on Multiple Heritage : Role of specialized Museums in India , held at Bhopal, from 25th and 27th July 2005 and published in the seminar proceedings entitled Multiple Heritage : Role of Specialized Museums in India K.K. Basa (ed.). The seminar was organized by IGRMS, Bhopal and INC-ICOM, Kolkata.</page><page sequence="2">244 Bulletin of the Deccan College 68-69 (2008-2009) like archaeochemistry, archaeozoology, palaeobotany, palynology, palaeontology, geology, geomorphology and biological anthropology, which none other department of Archaeology in the country has. It is also the only University Department of Archaeology, which conducts explorations and excavations on an all India basis. Dr. H.D. Sankalia joined this Institute as Professor of Indian pre and proto history on 17th August 1939 and thus, started the golden era of modern Indian archaeology. Within no time, the Institute started its own exploration and excavation programme. The first excavation was carried out at Langhnaj, Gujarat in 1942, and its results were impressive. The excavation yielded evidence of Mesolithic occupation and important human skeletal materials. Then onwards the college has systematically explored and excavated nearly 100 archaeological sites, ranging from prehistory to late medieval period (for details see Table 1). A repository attached to the museum stores these excavated and explored materials. With excavations in every part of India, Deccan College started accumulating enormous amount of cultural material from Prehistory to History; and with ethnographic expeditions and scientific approaches to excavated material, it has also been accumulating lot of ethnographic and science related material. And all these are the core of the Museum at Deccan College. It is important to mention here that almost all Fig.l: Deccan College Museum in Department of Archaeology at Deccan College</page><page sequence="3">Deccan College Museum: A Specialized Museum in Archaeology 245 the material are collected from context by the experts unlike most other museums where the objects are purchased or acquired from various other secondary sources. However, this museum does have, some material received in exchange as early as 1946, from other institutions and some as gifts from foreign museums such as Peabody Museum, Harvard University, USA; Institute of Archaeology, London; Musee ď i'home, Paris; University of Tubingen, Germany; Museum of Man, Bruno, Czechslovakia; Museums of Iran and Turkey; and prehistoric tools from Australia, Europe, Palestine and South Africa. Deccan College Museum was first established in 1940 in the main building,1 built in 1864 (Sankalia 1966: 5). In 1962 the present building of the Department of Archaeology, was constructed. The first floor (covering an area of about 15,500 sq. ft) of the department was meticulously, designed to make various galleries of the museum for displaying objects of the human past (Fig. 1). The museum has nine galleries each devoted to various field of archaeology i.e. Stone Age, Chalcolithic, Megalithic, Early Historic, Sculpture, Epigraphy and Numismatic, Sciences in Archaeology, Ethnoarchaeology and H.D. Sankalia Memorial gallery. The last gallery is not limited to any period but the work of Prof. H.D. Sankalia founder father of Archaeology Department. This is perhaps one of the biggest museum of any University Department in India. The museum is located 4 km away from the Pune Railway station and 5 km away from the International Airport. The college can be easily located as it is situated along Deccan College Road. To reach the museum the buses of Pune Municipal Transport or auto rickshaws are easily available from any part of the city. All the galleries of the museum are open to public without any admission fee. The museum is open on all working days between 10.45-13.30 hrs and 14.00-17.15 hrs. The museum remains closed on Sunday, 1st and 3rd Saturdays and all Government Holidays. Group visits by schools and colleges are arranged by prior intimation. Left side of the entrance gate of the Department of Archaeology is used as parking area for all types of vehicle. School buses can be parked in the College Campus, which has sufficient space. The museum workforce comprises one Lecturer cum Keeper, one Curator, one Museum Assistant and two Museum Cleaners. Aims of Deccan College Museum The main aim of Deccan College museum is educational. It displays selective cultural remains of the human past and is aimed to provide information on Ancient Indian History Culture and Archaeology to school students, college students, and school teachers as well as to the general public. * To introduce archaeology to general public and schoolteachers in rural and urban areas, through outreach programmes (exhibition) and also conducts teacher's one-day 1. With donation by Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy (1783-1859), the Second Baronet, one lakh rupees was given for construction of main building with Gothic architecture in the present campus.</page><page sequence="4">246 Bulletin of the Deccan College 68-69 (2008-2009) workshop in the month of July. Exhibitions in urban and rural area are substantiated with lectures and slide shows, which helps the general public in understanding our past culture. Special lectures are also given in schools and colleges whenever asked for. The teacher's workshop is for awareness among the schoolteachers who are teaching history in schools. They are encouraged to take part in this workshop, are introduced to archaeology in greater details with lectures, and visit to various labs and library of the Institute. This ultimately helps them in classroom teaching and when visiting with group of students to our museum. * To provide the facility to carryout research, on the collections, which are original antiquities from excavated and explored sites of India with their context known. Thus, serves as excellent study material to scholars and students engaged in archaeological/cultural research. In most cases these are displayed in self- explanatory manner. * Recently, the proposal for development of Open Heritage Park in collaboration with Pune Municipal Corporation and construction of a new building for Archaeology Museum in the Institute's campus is in progress. These two projects mainly aims to popularise archaeology and develop cultural heritage awareness among the general public. Museum Galleries An attempt has been made here to give brief information regarding the collections in various galleries. The students, general public and VIPs are generally briefed about the history of Deccan College and museum displays in the H.D. Sankalia Memorial Gallery.

Ethnoarchaeology Gallery Ethnography is the study of social, economic and linguistic aspects of a living society</page><page sequence="21">Deccan College Museum: A Specialized Museum in Archaeology 263 of a limited geographical area. The term Ethnoarchaeology is the use of ethnographic methods and information in the interpretation and explanation of archaeological data. Earliest studies carried out by Deccan College in 1960s were on the rural settlements around the Chalcolithic sites of Ahar and Navdatoli and the Neolithic sites of Tekkalkota. This gallery display material culture and technology of the Gond community of Madhya Pradesh, Ethnographic study in Uttar Pradesh and some photographs of Kuchabandhiya hunters, Gond tribal worshipping iron implements, huts, place of worship, and hunters with trap and mask. The display (Fig. 12) is of two types- write-ups on display board showing role of Ethnography in Archaeology with examples on houses and other structures, material culture, technology, religion and ritual and the second type in glass showcases, displaying various objects from Bastar, Chhattisgarh: * Material culture: terracotta horse, figurines, different types of comb, tobacco pouches, rope instruments, oil pressers, broom and baskets. * Fishing traps and nets; square net, fish traps, nets, cage type trap, funnel shaped trap, basket to keep fish and fishing nets. * Weapons; bow, arrow, bamboo, knife, iron traps and rope snares. * Musical instruments- dancing stick. * Ornaments and dress; beads, bangles and organic decoration * Religious objects, terracotta object and lamp.

Contributions of Deccan College Museum: In the earliest founded Indian museums, the geological and natural history collections took prominent place, and it was only later that archaeology came to the fore as a result of the formation of the Archaeological Survey in 1862 and the activities of Sir Alexander Cunningham. But the greatest activity resulted from the reorganisation (by Lord Curzon, Viceroy, 1899-1907) of Archaeological Survey in 1902 by reviving the post of Director General. The appointment of Sir John Marshall as the first Director General gave impetus to the archaeological museum. By the year 1936 there were ninteen museums, devoted entirely to the archaeology and by 2005 there are around 160 museums in India (Markham and Hargreaves 1936; Agrawal 2000). This includes 38 existing site museums and seven</page><page sequence="23">Deccan College Museum: A Specialized Museum in Archaeology 265 Fig. 13: Model of reconstruction of cultural sequence at Nevasa, Maharashtra more in progress (Annual Reports 2003-2004 of Department of Culture). With the above background, the importance and contribution of Archaeology museum at Deccan College can be summarised as followings: Cultural Sequence of Stone Age India The initial excavations of the college were designed to understand the cultural sequence of Stone Age (See table 1). This led to number of excavations in various parts of the country and collection of innumerable artefacts and other cultural remains from the site. Thus, it is important to mention here that all museum collection is authentic, contextual and information on them can be obtained from published reports and articles as well. First farming settlements in the country The Neolithic-Chalcolithic gallery at the museum displays those artefacts, which highlights the development of man from nomadism to settled life. The model of the Chalcolithic village at Inamgaon displays the cultural sequence, adaptation, customs and the reasons of abandonment of the site. This model also helps students and general visitors</page><page sequence="24">266 Bulletin of the Deccan College 68-69 (2008-2009) to understand how a excavated site looks like and how archaeologist do reconstruction of the floors, post hole, pits and other important markers at the site. Nevasa model Prof. H.D. Sankalia excavated the site of Nevasa during 1954-56, leading to the reconstruction of a detailed stratigraphical- climatic-cultural sequence (Fig. 13). Various other departments throughout the country effectively followed this paradigm. This model (made by Shri A.A. Dalvi) in H.D. Sankalia Memorial gallery displays typical objects (all made to scale) of various period, in their stratigraphical context. In the making of the layers, the soil or earth actually found has been used to give the idea of three 'C' in stratigraphical study i.e. colour, content and composition. Thus the entire model is as true to be the original as possible. This being the main attractions at the museum, the visitors are briefed here regarding the various techniques involved in understanding past. This model serves as an open textbook with all the details, best for explanation. Here at a glance one can understand the development of material culture- like houses, tools and weapons, pottery, ornaments, sanitary convenience and burial practices- right from Palaeolithic to 14th -15th century AD, say covering a period of nearly four lakh years. Nature and chronology of Megaliths The excavations carried out in the Vidharba region have shown the development of man, customs, belief system, and technology. This gallery focuses on the Megalithic culture, its spread, and living Megalithism in central and northeastern India and of world. Relation between literary tradition and archaeology for authentication: The department has also been working on the identification of place-names and reconstruction of ancient administrative units mentioned in inscription over a period of 1000 years (c. 100 BC-1200 AD). So far Gujarat, Maharashtra and Kamataka have been covered. This has been permanently displayed on the walls of the Central hall, on the ground floor of the Department of Archaeology. It is noteworthy to mention here that Dr. V.D. Gogte has recently identified sites like Palshet, Chaul, Mandad and Dahanu dated on the basis of ancient literature like Periplus of the Erythrean Sea, Ptolemy and Copper Plate Inscriptions. Postulated phases of India pre-and proto- history in the light of culture change and factors responsible Environment plays an important role in understanding the formation and destruction of any culture. Thus, one of the major researches conducted by Deccan College concerns with the reconstruction of Palaeoenvironment. The geomorphological, sedementilogical and palaeontological studies are useful for relative dating and have enabled a clear understanding of the past landscapes, vegetation and wildlife settings. These reconstructions have made it possible to understand the Stone Age cultures from the point of human adaptations. For example:</page><page sequence="25">Deccan College Museum: A Specialized Museum in Archaeology 267 * Rebuilding Quaternary Palaeoclimate (last two million years) in inter dunal lake at Akaj (Gujarat) saw the formation of the lake in a former dune field, contrasting the former arid climate with present humid climate. * Flood channels of the Krishna river at Yedurwadi (south of Sangli) shows alluvium deposited more than 350,000 yrs ago, when the climate was arid. * Fossil sand dune at Langhnaj (Gujarat): At the time the dune was forming the region was a dessert. And the soil developed on the dune surface belongs to the recent humid phase of climate. * 16R sand dune at Didwana (Nagaur, Rajasthan): The sand accumulated on the dune during periods of greater aridity while erosion of the sand dune seen in layer of coarse sand occurred during periods of more humid climate. Archaeological material is found within layers indicating more humid climate. During period of sand accumulation the dune built up rapidly while no accumulation or erosion occurred during period of human occupation. * Bagor (Bhilwara, Rajasthan) a Stone Age settlement in sand dune revealed history of 5000 years before the Christian era. Revealing a picture of changing and developing prehistoric culture through contact with more advanced neighbouring communities. * Pollen analysis and palaeoenvironmetal studies in Thar dessert, Rajasthan shows change in palaeoenvironment condition from hyper-arid to semi-arid-humid during Terminal Pleistocene-Holocene. Western Rajasthan lakes seem to have dried earlier by 1-2 ka as compared to lakes on eastern side like Didwana, which got desiccated around 4 ka. * Susrondi, (Guhagar, District Ratnagiri, Konkan) Palaeolithic artefacts from the cave site in a stratified context is exceedingly significant in deducing the chronology of Early man and related sea level changes. The environmental studies carried out by the department have greatly helped in under- standing the phenomena of environmental change. Reconstruction of life ways of prehistoric and early historic people: Attempts are made through paintings, models and dioramas to represent the reconstruction of the past society. For example the diorama with painting in Chalcolithic and Megalithic gallery attempt a reconstruction of their culture. Model representing the Chalcolithic village and painting of potters of Navdatoli (1700-1300 BC). Reconstruction through painting of Megalithic burial of Vidarbha and a reconstruction of beginning of civilisation in South India (20,000-2,200 BP) and Neolithic village of Sangankallu (1800-1200 BC). Experimental Archaeology Yet another special feature of the Deccan college research is studying the primary sites containing Stone Age record in undisturbed</page><page sequence="26">268 Bulletin of the Deccan College 68-69 (2008-2009) context. Drs. V.N. Misra, R.S. Pappu, M.L.K. Murty, K. Paddayya and others have excavated several open air and rock shelter sites. These excavations coupled with ethnoarchaeological and experimental studies, have led to a more detailed understanding of Prehistoric settlement patterns, hunting gathering practices, ancient technology and other aspects. These all are scientifically displayed in various galleries. The study of Dhangars, a pastoral group of Maharashtra studied by Dr. K.C. Malhotra highlights some of the earlier ethnographic work done at Deccan College. At Inamgaon the pit dwellings were understood by surveying contemporary societies by Prof. M.K. Dhavalikar. Sciences in Archaeology This gallery is liked by all school children. Through this gallery they get to know various branches of sciences helping archaeology. The actual evidences are also displayed in various labs in the department like; Archaeozoology, Palaeobotany, Palynology, Anthropology, Geomorphology, Palaentology and Archaeochemistry. These labs are well equipped with modern parallels as well as ancient evidences for understanding food habits, technique of preparation of food, environment, landscape, extinct animals, paleopathology, soil analysis and relative dating. Many research scholars come to these labs for reference. Art of India Art of India is represented by number of sculptures in sculptures gallery. However, the interesting representation of Daultabad fort in the form of painting is well displayed. Parting Education The display at the museum is designed for the educational needs: * In the beginning of the academic year the Director of the Institute briefs MA and Diploma students about the subject in the museum. * V arious types of visitors visit the museum, the bulk comprises of school children and teachers, and college going students hence, educating them from prehistory to history in the main task; for this guided tours are organised. Various queries are answered during this tour, which helps the students to understand more about are rich heritage. * In recent past the goal of the museum is to bring archaeology to common man hence exhibition are organised at various places across the country. For example on 3rd to 6th February 2004 an Exhibition was organised at the Chalcolithic site of Inamgaon on request by the elders and young learned of the village. Various schools around the village also visited this exhibition. Besides one-day teachers workshop was also organised for the schoolteachers for them to learn more about archaeology. * The object of collection is part of research and for further research. Various scholars and researchers from India and abroad visit museum for photography and reference.</page><page sequence="27">Deccan College Museum: A Specialized Museum in Archaeology 269 Comments The Deccan College museum is one of its own kinds where objects are not collected randomly but from scientific excavation from length and breadth of the country. Each object in museum has an objective behind its collection and its own story for everyone from school children, layman to serious researchers. The other most interesting objective of the museum is to facilitate scholars and researches with easy availability of the stored objects. Besides, the scholars can also carryout scientific analysis in various labs at the Institute.
