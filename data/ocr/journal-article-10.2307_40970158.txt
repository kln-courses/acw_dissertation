<plain_text><page sequence="1">REGICIDE AND REVOLUTION* BY MICHAEL WALZER In writing about regicide, it is important not to "tell sad stories of the deaths of kings/' There are stories enough to tell, brutal tales of deposition, imprisonment, and murder, moving legends of the last days of this or that ruler. It is no doubt a central feature of kingship that kings are so prone to be killed. But the sad stories are of no help in the study I propose here - of European monarchy and its fall, or rather, of how monarchy was destroyed in the persons of two of its leading representatives, Charles I of England and Louis XVI of France. By themselves, moreover, they only make the survival of royal authority until those two executions seem strange indeed: why did the premature deaths of so many kings have so little effect upon the magic and even upon the everyday effectiveness of kingship? Monarchy depends upon an ideology of personal rule. While it acquires over time a great variety of justifications, including utilitarian justifications, it remains fundamentally dependent upon a set of beliefs about the person of the king. Subjects must feel some awe in the royal presence; they must sustain some faith in the king's sanctity, power, and wisdom; they must believe in his inviolability. The murderers of kings presumably do not share these feelings and beliefs, though we may doubt that they escape them entirely. For much of European history, entire disbelief was a species of atheism, rarely encountered; and most royal assassins, though not those who thought themselves divinely inspired, must have died fully expecting to suffer in hell forever. In any case, their skepticism, if it existed, was never communi- cated to the mass of the king's subjects. Popular faith in the royal person - in the medieval and early modern periods, the faith of practically everyone - seems to have been readily transferable from</page><page sequence="2">618 SOCIAL RESEARCH dead to living monarchs. Nor did it matter a great deal that the death of the old king was brutally unnatural, though it sometimes made trouble that the claim of the new king was illegitimate. The personal suffering and degradation of a particular monarch, once thought almighty and godlike, was never to my knowledge made into an argument against monarchy. One reason for this is obvious: in Christendom, God himself was thought to have suffered and died. He had not, however, been succeeded by a rival claimant, and so there must be other, more political reasons for the success of irregular and unnatural succes- sions. Two Kinds of Regicide Until the English Revolution, kings were killed by would-be kings or by lonely assassins in the pay of would-be kings. Again, exception must be made for religious zealots, whom no one needed to pay, but they too struck down the old ruler in the hope of a new one more firmly formed in the image of their own faith. It never occurred to them, as Albert Camus says in his essay The Rebel, that the throne might remain empty.1 Nor was it ever in the interests of the new rulers, for obvious reasons, that monarchy itself should be called into question. They intrigued and killed precisely in order to become kings, and in this way offered their own deeply felt testimony to the power of kingship. Once installed, they sought always to preserve for themselves the personal authority of the man at whose death they had con- nived; so they connived again at the perpetuation of the myths of monarchy and sometimes at their invention. Thus, the be- havior of Henry IV of England, after deposing and (apparently) planning the murder of Richard II: he had himself anointed with a mysterious oil, given, it was said, by the Virgin Mary to i Albert Camus, The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt, translated by Anthony Bower (New York: Random House, 1956), p. 112.

A recent biog- rapher of Richard has argued that "medieval divine right" died with that unhappy king, "smothered or starved in Pontefract Castle. " 3 I doubt very much that this is true. Divine right is not subject to smothering or starvation and certainly not to smothering or starvation in the hidden recesses of Pontefract Castle. Nor is there any evidence that Englishmen during the reign of Henry V (for example) felt radically differently about the royal person than Englishmen had felt two reigns earlier. A line of succession was broken in 1399, but that is something quite different from - and much more frequent than - the death of divine right. Richard's deposition was cited during the trial of Charles, but it was not a good precedent. Henry had worked hard to make sure that it would not be. Above all, he had resisted anything that resembled a parliamentary trial. Richard had not been deposed, according to his successor; he had willingly, even "cheer- fully" abdicated. Parliament had merely recognized the abdica- tion.4 Then Richard had died, somehow, in the North, far from Henry's hand. According to most accounts, the new king never admitted that Richard had been murdered, but Shakespeare, following a different tradition, has Henry acknowledge the murder and then repudiate the murderer: "With Cain, go wander through the shade of night." The new king admits no responsibility for the death of the old. It is even more important that Parliament 2 Marc Bloch, Les rois thaumaturges (Paris: Colin, 1961), pp. 241-242. See also Percy E.

If it is accurate, then William Prynne was right in 1648 when he denied that Richard's deposition provided any basis for the trial of Charles (Speech in the House of Commons . . . the Fourth of December 1648 [London, 1649], p. 78).</page><page sequence="4">620 SOCIAL RESEARCH was not in any sense complicitous. And though a group of prominent Londoners had called for Richard's execution when he was first brought to the Tower, he was not killed at their call. In the matter of regicide, the nation was not involved. So kings for centuries were killed in corners, the murders hushed up, the murderers unthanked, neglected, condemned. That is the substance of the sad stories. And monarchy survived. Even in the eighteenth century, the slaughter went on. Indeed, there is no piece of dynastic history more bizarre and bloody than that of the Romanovs in the Age of Enlightenment: it included the murder of a crown prince by his father and of a reigning czar by his wife. Yet living monarchs in the rest of Europe watched, congratulated the survivors, and apparently felt the spectacle no threat to their own pretensions.5 More philosophic onlookers managed to discover in the triumph of Catherine a victory for enlightened despotism - the short-lived legatee of divine-right kingship. Even they could not imagine an empty throne. In Russia, at the end of it all, Paul II, half mad, expecting his assassin every day, nevertheless proclaimed his absolute authority, reasserted divine right, and established a succession that lasted for more than a century. The murders of Alexis, Ivan VI, Peter III, and finally of Paul himself did not weaken the hand of nineteenth- century czars. They were not driven to modify their claims, their subjects were not encouraged to challenge their rulers or deny those claims. Faith in the person of the czar survived, embodied as late as the Revolution of 1905 in the pathetic monk Gapon and the thousands of workers who marched behind him. But there is another kind of regicide that changes monarchy forever. It is best revealed, perhaps, in a remark Oliver Crom- well is supposed to have made to Algernon Sidney on the eve of the condemnation of Charles I: "I tell you, we will cut off his s Thus Louis XV, writing to his ambassador after the accession of Catherine: "The dissimulation of the empress and her courage at the moment of execution of her project [the murder of her husband] indicate a princess capable of conceiving and executing great deeds" (quoted in Albert Sorel, Europe under the Old Regime, translated by Francis H. Herrick [New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1964], p. 41).</page><page sequence="5">REGICIDE AND REVOLUTION 621 head with the crown on it." 6 What is apparent here is the fixed commitment - it is a revolutionary commitment - not only to kill Charles but to kill him in his public character and in public. Sidney was reluctant to do any such thing, and no doubt many other members even of the purged Parliament were reluctant also. Yet the charge brought before the tribunal they constituted is clear enough: "A charge of High Treason . . . exhibited . . . for and on behalf of the People of England against Charles Stuart King of England." In France there were important disagree- ments as to the precise status of the king at the time of his trial. Formally he was no longer King of France but le ci-devant roi, plain Louis Capet, and many of the revolutionaries hoped that he would be tried like any other citizen. The public stage could not, however, be denied the public person: all France and all Europe knew that the king was on trial. Though Louis's citizen- ship was, as I will argue later, an important theoretical discovery, his trial testified nevertheless to the practical way in which mon- archy resisted legal and political egalitarianism. The king de- feated and brought low remained somehow a royal figure; the king imprisoned was still, as Charles insisted, "no ordinary prisoner." 7 To try him and then to execute him in public was to challenge monarchy itself. Cromwell's "we" is as important as his insistence that the crown and not only the king be brought to the scaffold. It was not the royal "we," though that was a form of address Oliver would one day adopt. The king was condemned by a group of men who represented his successors, however that succession is conceived: the people of England, the Commons, the army. And the mem- bers of that group were public men who signed their names, boldly or fearfully, and accepted responsibility for the solemn execution that their signatures authorized. The executioner wore a mask; not so the judges. Whatever legal subterfuges the trial of the king required and whatever excuses individual regicides e Joseph G. Muddiman, Trial of Charles the First (Edinburgh: Hodge, 1928), p. 70. 7 Ibid., p. 93.</page><page sequence="6">622 SOCIAL RESEARCH later offered, their participation could not be denied. We do not know what happened at Pontefract Castle; the proceedings at Westminster and Whitehall were published to the world. Here, then, were ci-devant subjects, who judged and killed their king and (some of them) boasted of the act. "This subjugation, which forces the sovereign to take the law from his people, is the last calamity that can fall upon a man of our rank." So wrote Louis XIV not of the first but of the second Charles.8 He was referring to the king's dependence, after the Restoration, upon parliamentary appropriations. But it might better be said that the "last calamity" of kings is not to take the law in the form of legislation, but to take it - that is, to receive it - in the form of justice. Public regicide is a denial not of the king's legislative power or his executive prerogative, but of his personal inviolability - and therefore of all the mysteries of king- ship without which the practical powers of monarchy cannot sur- vive for long. The importance of mystery to the integrity of monarchic rule and the importance of its denial to the establish- ment of democratic regimes form a large part of my subject in this essay. Once a king has been judged by his subjects, I will argue, monarchy is never the same; it can survive a thousand assassina- tions but not one execution. The invasion of the arcana imperii by commoners and assemblymen is, after that, a relatively easy matter. Kings may return for a time, but, as Jean Jaurès says in his monumental history of the French Revolution, "they are never more than phantoms." 9 Majesty cannot be restored. Though they call themselves godlike, there is no resurrection for kings; divine right itself was killed at Whitehall and the Place de la Revolution. Public regicide is an absolutely decisive way of breaking with the myths of the old regime, and it is for this very reason the founding act of the new. It might be compared with other such s Quoted in John B. Wolf, "The Formation of a King," in John C.

Beginnings are bloody because there are always rival claimants to power, while "to found a republic, one must be alone." 10 That harsh sentence helps explain the fratricidal struggles of the revolutionary period and the dictatorship which most often follows upon them. The trial and execution of the king, however, are founding acts of another kind. To found a republic, the regicides say, one must kill the man who claims to rule alone. The difference is impor- tant. Machiavelli is dealing with foundation ex nihilo: before Romulus there was no Rome. But English and French revolu- tionaries confronted old regimes and royal houses long established. "What is there in common between Louis and the French people?" asked the Jacobin St. Just.11 The answer is obvious: he and his family, they and their ancestors, share a thousand years of history. The revolution necessarily involves a judgment on those years, and that judgment is given when Louis is brought to trial and publicly killed. The Jacobins would have settled for the execu- tion alone; they opposed the trial for reasons I will examine below. But the majority of the revolutionaries in both England and France thought the trial necessary so that the killing of the king would appear not merely to be justifiable but to be (what they thought it was) an act of justice and an explicit denial of the king's claim to rule. Only the trial could make it clear that Louis was being killed in accordance with new political principles, and only then would his execution mark the triumph not of a new set of men but of a new kind of government. These straightforwardly political purposes account for many of the doubts that have been expressed over the years about the trial of Louis and also about that of Charles, its historical model.12 The use of judicial or semijudicial processes to destroy a political io Machiavelli, The Discourses, I, 9. ii Archives Parlementaires de 1787 à I860, 1st series, LUI (Paris, 1899), 391. 12 Otto Kirchheimer, Political Justice: The Use of Legal Procedure for Political Ends (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1961), pp. 304 ff. This is an especially helpful discussion of the problems raised by these and similar trials.</page><page sequence="8">624 SOCIAL RESEARCH enemy was not new, of course, to either England or France. Kings, like the men who eventually defeated them, had often found it wise or prudent to turn to judges rather than to assassins, and to charge their victims with treason rather than simply to have them murdered. The treason laws had even been used against the advisers and friends of the king himself by opposition groups unwilling or unable to touch the royal person. Nor had there been qualms on either side about inventing treasons after the fact to catch ambitious or powerful men who had probably not done anything illegal. But revolutionary justice is not ex post facto in this usual sense, for now it is not only the laws that are new but also the regime. The men who fall before the justice of the revolution are condemned in alien courts and assemblies, and they are condemned by their triumphant oppo- nents. That makes for a very peculiar kind of justice indeed, which may not warrant the name even though it cannot dispense with the appearance. In the French case, regicide is often described as the beginning of the Terror, the first act in the bloody assizes of the modern age.13 It is true that the terrorists, like the regicides, exploited the forms of law for political purposes. Yet I shall try in the last section of this essay to draw a line between the two and to give reasons for doing so. First, however, it will be necessary to say something about the old regime, for if every trial is a kind of settlement with the past, this is true in a special sense of the trials of Charles and Louis. The revolutionaries could not attend only to the king's actions; in the turmoil of the revolutionary struggle the precise status of those actions, as of the king's person, was radically unclear. They had to attend to his kingship as well. It was monarchy itself that established the context within which the king acted and the background against which, finally, he was judged. The crucial issue before the Convention in its first months was the relation of the monarchy and the revolution, and this was the topic of the extraordinary debate among the delegates is Camus' The Rebel is the classic example of this view.</page><page sequence="9">REGICIDE AND REVOLUTION 625 in November and December, 1792, when the trial was being prepared. St. Just's dramatic question was meant to deny that there was any relation at all (except that of war): he intended to raise the most serious doubts about the very possibility and also about the moral necessity of doing justice to a king. The opponents of the Mountain had another view not only of revolu- tionary justice but also of what it meant to be a king under the old regime and to exercise the royal prerogative. The his- toricity of either of these views is less important than the fact that both were focused on the past. In this sense, at least, regicide was like punishment rather than like terrorism (or assassination): it was backward looking in the most profound way. The Ideology of Kingship There is no single way of describing a king. The ideology of kingship in the West draws upon many distinct traditions of thought - classical, Oriental, Germanic, feudal, and Christian - and the long process of amalgamation and distortion has a suc- cession of outcomes, which parallel, though they do not narrowly reflect, changes in the political structure of the monarchic regime. I shall focus largely on the last of these, royalism before the revolu- tion, the ideology of absolute monarchy. But I shall venture to argue also that this last amalgamation was the most important and the most characteristic form of royalist doctrine. This is not to deny that it remained possible, even at the end, to tear the strands apart and weave a new pattern: many of the revolu- tionaries were trying to do just that. Nor do I want to suggest that every previous king wanted to write like James I or rule (though this is more likely) like Louis XIV. No doubt, their practical aspirations were limited by their immediate possibilities, as well as by the particular idealism of their time and place. There was never a perfected kingship, established once and for all by God, immune from political conflict. There was never a</page><page sequence="10">626 SOCIAL RESEARCH perfected tyranny, embodiment of kingly arrogance and arbitrary power, awaiting the climactic attack of the people. Centralized monarchy as the regicides confronted it - the king sovereign in more than name - is a late and relatively short-lived achievement. It is the work of latter-day kings or their ministers, and it formed, as Tocqueville insisted, the immediate inheritance of the revolution.14 Age-old monarchy had been something dif- ferent, and because of what it had been, revolutionary arguments against royal absolutism were rarely new. Except for brief mo- ments, it was the usual lot of European kings to endure extensive limits on their authority, imposed by a universal church or a locally entrenched aristocracy and justified in the most elaborate fashion. But these limits, practical or moral, have no essential form - no more than royal power itself. They vary with time. So historians can trace the rise and fall of dynasties, the decline and resurgence of monarchic authority. They can record that this or that ruler could not act without these allies; lost out to those opponents; granted these rights, withdrew those; faltered before or heroically overcame the sheer disorganization of his realm, and so on. The possibilities are at least as various for the lives as for the deaths of kings. Despite all this, there are deep similarities in the pretensions of kings, in the claims they have made and struggled to enforce over the centuries. If there is no essential kingship, there are nevertheless characteristic patterns of royal aggrandizement. Even more important for my purposes here, there are profound con- tinuities in the myths - what the revolutionaries in England and France called the "superstitions" - that both underlay and served this aggrandizement. Though these were consciously sponsored by kings and their publicists, they cannot be regarded simply as propaganda. They attained to the status of popular beliefs, were probably believed by kings and their publicists, and lived on until and even after monarchy was decisively overthrown. They helped i* Alexis de Tocqueville, The Old Regime and the French Revolution, translated by Stuart Gilbert (New York: Doubleday Anchor Books, 1955), pp. 32 ff.</page><page sequence="11">REGICIDE AND REVOLUTION 627 to determine the character of the overthrow. No doubt the forms of power, argument, and mythic elaboration varied a great deal. Through it all, there can be detected a kind of regal optimism that is almost always the same. It is as if every king until the revolution preened himself before the same magic mirror and saw the same gratifying image: himself God's deputy, head and soul of the body politic, sole knower of the mysteries of state, father of his subjects, husband of the realm, healer, peacemaker, sovereign lord. The characteristic sin of kings is pride. Perhaps this is part of what St. Just meant when he said, "No man can reign innocently." 15 Even the burdens of kingship can be, in- deed must be, a source of pride: . . . What infinite heart's ease Must kings neglect that private men enjoy! The famous lines of Shakespeare's Henry V are a boast, not a lament as is commonly thought, for it is a boast to envy one's own subjects the enjoyment of the protection provided by oneself. (It is the poet's not the king's irony that the subjects so envied are soldiers awaiting battle, some of whom will die the next day in the king's war.) Henry has no desire that private men join him in neglecting their hearts' ease. The attempt would be treason. Nor does he believe any such sharing possible, for "gross brain little wots/What watch the King keeps. . . ." This is the pride of monarchs, the inescapable moral corollary of the claim to rule alone. To see kingship in this way, as a set of abiding pretensions vari- ously asserted and acted out, is no doubt dangerous. It pays too much attention to royalist argument and ceremonial and too little attention to the theoretical and practical limits on royal authority. These last will be considered later, for they figured significantly in the arguments of the revolutionaries. In the cen- tury and a half before each of the revolutions, however, kings were triumphant, and they did not hesitate to draw upon the 15 Archives Parlementaires, LUI, 391.</page><page sequence="12">628 SOCIAL RESEARCH ancient arsenal of kingly pretension. They acted as kings had long claimed it was right for them to act. And the content, the force, and the wide acceptance of these claims go a long way toward explaining why such different institutional arrangements as those of England and France yielded in similar ways to monarchic self-assertion and then to popular rebellion. The similarity re- quires explanation, since so much has been made of the differences. Thus, Walter Ullmann distinguishes two radically opposed pat- terns of monarchic rule, peculiar, he argues, to the French and the English. He names them theocratic and feudal kingship, and after a long and impressive description of the two, concludes that "The former led to revolution, the latter to evolution." 16 If this is a reference to the actual histories of France and England, and not to some idea of historical development, it is plainly wrong. Both patterns "led to" revolution. Two European kings were defeated, imprisoned, charged with treason against their own people, condemned, and brought to the block. It is true that the English have a monarch still, while the French do not, and these outcomes and other more significant differences in the two regimes probably have a great deal to do with the histories Ullmann has studied. But it is also true that these histories are marked by strikingly similar eruptions, and his- torians must search for common causes. Among these, the "superstitions" of kingship must rank high, even if they are regarded as nothing more than the intellectual weapons of social and political forces. For as men are armed, so they will fight. In fact, however, the history of royalist ideol- ogy suggests a certain independence from sociological determi- nation. Royalism is the ruling idea of a ruling class consisting ultimately of only one man, and to account for the range of groups and classes within which it has been believed or for its historical pervasiveness is not a task to be undertaken light- 16 Walter Ullmann, The Principles of Government and Politics in the Middle Ages (London: Methuen, 1961), p. 211.</page><page sequence="13">REGICIDE AND REVOLUTION 629 heartedly.17 I shall not undertake it here, but only insist upon the central importance of this strange creed which taught one man to rule and everyone else to obey. By 1640 and 1789, its tenets were widely doubted, perhaps, and yet the two revolutions cannot be understood without continual reference to the terms it had fixed. Charles and Louis were killed in large part because of what kingship was: not simply because they were unlucky enough to be kings at the moment revolution broke out, but rather because, confronted with revolution, they were stubbornly loyal to royalist ideology. The more moderate revolutionaries - Cromwell himself in England, Mirabeau, Barnave, Roland among the French - literally pleaded with them to surrender (some of) their royal pretensions. Ordinary men though they were, they would not yield on what seemed to them points of right. Poor Louis XVI can hardly have believed that he ruled in God's place, yet when he vowed "to drink the cup until the last dregs/* he knew he was acting the way kings were supposed to act. It was a triumph of ideology over mere personality. But the complex and elaborate belief system that I have called royalism included more than one man's claim to rule. It sug- gested and justified the kind of political order that could only be ruled by one man. The ideology of kingship was also the ideology of the old regime. If members of the aristocratic opposition often doubted this, they paid a price for their skepticism: they developed, willy-nilly, the crucial ideas of the revolution. What has often been called bourgeois political thought was first of all the work of aristocrats and of writers in their pay. The notion that a man's home was his castle, protected even against royal 17 The relative power of particular kings obviously has to be explained at least partly by reference to the balance of social forces. In his Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, Marx puts forward such an explanation for both Bonapartism and absolute monarchy: rulers like Elizabeth I, Louis XIV, and Napoleon, he argues, exploited the near equality of social classes, playing one against the other in order to maintain their own positions. One would have to look to other factors, how- ever, to explain the stability and persistence of monarchic, as distinct from Bona- partist, institutions. Kingship was not easily overthrown, even when the balance of social forces radically shifted.</page><page sequence="14">630 SOCIAL RESEARCH invasion, was first put forward by men whose castles were their homes. The rights of the people were systematically confused by many noblemen with their own privileges, and owe much of their original elaboration to that confusion. The noblemen thought of themselves as the natural leaders of the people against the overbearing power of the king. In fact, they could not dis- pense with the king, however they might challenge him, any more than the pope and the bishops could dispense with the king, despite their long struggle against royal sovereignty. And kings, though they won out against the pope and the barons, could not preside for long over a society of equals.18 The great men of the old regime required one another, for their privileges were of essentially the same sort. James I was right when he said, "No bishop, no king"; and Louis XVI might equally well have told his aristocratic opponents of 1787 and 1788, "No king, no notables." "The state is in the person of the prince/' Bishop Bossuet taught the dauphin of France.19 If this was not, could not be literally true, it was true that the old regime was often conceived and understood with reference exclusively to the king's person. The idea of the state was included in the idea of the prince. Social and political historians have told us a great deal about the nature of the old regime, but they have rarely speculated as to why it required or was susceptible to such a strange intellectual embodiment. The answer surely lies in the patterns of inequality that prevailed under the old regime and required bishops and aristocrats every day to make claims on other men of the same sort that the king made on all men. Royal authority was sym- bolically portioned out even when it was not shared in practice; is "For where there is equality of estates . . . there can be no monarchy" (The Political Writings of James Harrington, edited by Charles Blitzer [New York: Bobbs- Merrill, 1955], p. 97). This is probably the only sociological limit on monarchic rule- and even it is called into question by anthropological studies of African kingship. 19 Jacques- Bénigne Bossuet, Politique Uree des propres paroles de l Ecriture sainte, edited by Jacques Le Brun (Geneva: Librairie Droz, 1967), p. 185.</page><page sequence="15">REGICIDE AND REVOLUTION 631 most often, of course, it was shared in practice. Throughout society, inequality was radically personal in nature, and it was at least partly explained by reference to the personal attributes of the king.20 He had been touched by God, singled out as divine deputy; hence he was godlike and living proof that heaven itself intended men to be unequal in rank and privilege. The king was quite simply a different sort of person, and lesser men were different too in ways that had to be respected by still lesser men, who shared only a common humanity. This social hierarchy was most readily and familiarly represented in organic terms, as a body which God had created and the king now headed, all of whose parts were as naturally differentiated as were the royal head and the plebeian feet. The state in theory was the king's body politic, and it will be necessary to look closely at this body, first because its extended form was the form of the old regime, second because it made the old regime killable, as it were, in the person of the king. The monarchy could be destroyed, however, only if it was the king as embodiment and not merely the king as natural body that was put to death. Hence the distinction already made between public regicide and the assassination or secret murder of kings, a distinction which directly parallels the mystery of the king's two bodies. This important theme of royalist ideology has been so brilliantly treated by Ernst Kantorowicz that I need only allude to his discussion here and stress (as he does not) its central im- portance in the explanation of regicide.21 Royal publicists claimed that the king's body politic was immortal; the king with his crown could not die, even if an assassin struck down the man who wore the crown. But the public trial and execution of the king could and did destroy the king's body politic along with the man himself. It was precisely because he was "twice-born," as body and embodi- 20 Schramm describes how the social hierarchy was ceremonially represented at the coronation of the king: "On that day the feudal pyramid . . . appeared in visible shape" (English Coronation, p. 69). 2i Ernst Kantorowicz, The King's Two Bodies ; A Study of Medieval Political Theology (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1957).</page><page sequence="16">632 SOCIAL RESEARCH ment, that the king had to die and to die in public. It was royalist ideology that inextricably bound together revolutionary change and the killing of kings. Kantorowicz's own view of the two revolutions is rather differ- ent from this. He emphasizes the way in which Parliament, during the early 1640s, was able to exploit the mystery of the king's two bodies: it claimed to be fighting the king (body) in the name of the King (embodiment), Charles Stuart in the name of the Crown of England. But he is wrong, I think, when he suggests that the revolutionaries actually "succeeded ... in ex- ecuting solely the king's body natural without affecting seriously or doing irreparable harm to the king's body politic - in con- tradistinction with the events in France in 1793." 22 In fact, irreparable harm was done, if not to monarchy itself, then pre- cisely to the king's body politic. After the revolution, kings no longer claimed to embody the realm or attempted to draw prac- tical conclusions from their royal headship; or, if they did, they were quickly reminded of their new condition. Nor did any major political theorist describe English monarchy after 1649 in such flattering terms as Bossuet provided for the French. Like Ullmann (and many other historians), Kantorowicz underesti- mates the radicalism of the English, though not of the French, revolution. This is especially curious in his case, for it was the English who brought a reigning king to the bar, while the French Convention officially summoned citizen Louis Capet. It is only fair to say, however, that in both cases the king's two bodies proved inseparable. The emperor Caligula is said to have wished that the Roman people had but one neck, that he might cut it through with one blow. The sentence suggests how much easier it is or should be to fight against kings than to subjugate peoples. Yet the revolu- tionaries, whose enemies in fact had but one neck, found it extraor- dinarily difficult to strike the blow that would destroy them. And though only one head dropped into the basket at Whitehall 22 ibid., p. 23.</page><page sequence="17">REGICIDE AND REVOLUTION 633 in 1649, the moan that went through the crowd expressed a general loss. It was painful to kill the king - not only for the king - because the regime he embodied was both divine and natural in a way no other regime could ever be. This special and inimitable character of the royal embodiment can be explained in two ways. It might be said simply that kingship cannot be de- fended except by calling it divine and natural. No utilitarian argument will do the job for long, and so royal publicists had no choice but to work out the two mysteries of the king as divine deputy and head of the body politic. Insofar as they were believed, men found the mysteries comforting and mourned their loss. True enough, perhaps, but that does not explain why they were so widely believed. It might better be said that kingship lent itself to these sorts of mystic representation; the mysteries were not only morally satisfying but also convincing. They were convincing because the king ruled alone, like God, and because he had a body like other men in which the body politic was made visible and actual. J. N. Figgis has offered a partial defense of the theory of the divine right of kings by saying that it kept alive the organic conception of the state.23 One might say also that it kept alive an anthropomorphic theology. It could hardly help but serve both these (dubious) purposes, so long as God was deputized and the regime represented by a single, bio- logically distinct, humanly shaped organism. Moreover, the state was in fact governed by the rhythmic forces of growth and decay when it was ruled by a king, and God was actually incarnate as he never would be again once sovereignty had been vested in impersonal and abstract powers. The King's Divine Right Monarchy is no doubt compatible with a great variety of re- ligious systems. But Christian monarchy is best understood as 23 John Neville Figgis, The Divine Riglit of Kings, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1914), pp. 250 ff.</page><page sequence="18">634 SOCIAL RESEARCH a reflection of Christian monotheism: the king is not only made, like other men, in God's image; he is specially marked out to represent the will of God on earth. This is by no means implausi- ble, for though one can imagine a God who has no politics at all, it is hard to imagine a politically active and interested God who works his will through parliaments. Assemblies of priests have at times claimed divine inspiration, as if God could rule through them as he presumably ruled Israel through priests and judges before the time of Saul. Israel, writes Bossuet, "was a kind of republic, which had God for king." 24 During the late Middle Ages, conciliarist writers defended the prerogatives of priestly as- semblies and perhaps had such a republic in mind. But Christian theocracy culminated in the papal monarchy, in the rule of a priest, not of priests - indeed, in the most centralized and abso- lute of medieval governments. In his curia, the pope resembled God in his heavenly court, where government is also centralized and absolute: "God," as Bossuet said, "is the true king." 25 And "kings are justly called Gods," declared James I of England, "for that they exercise a manner or resemblance of divine power upon earth. For if you will consider the attributes of God, you shall see how they agree in the person of a King." 26 The argument is unanswerable, so long as one is committed to talk in terms of re- semblances. However one pictures God, he does not look like a council or a crowd. Yet divine omnipotence, which royal power only resembles and cannot equal, poses a problem for this way of thinking. Every regime that exists surely exists in accordance with God's will; there is no power that is not of God, whether it is exercised by kings, oligarchs, or popular tribunes. Bossuet at least recognizes that this is true and then is driven to the strange locution that monarchy is "the most conformable [le plus conforme] to the will 24 Bossuet, Politique, p. 52. 25 Ibid., p. 44. 26 The Political Works of James I, with an introduction by Charles Howard Mcllwain (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1918), p. 307.</page><page sequence="19">REGICIDE AND REVOLUTION 635 of God." 27 The phrase suggests some special knowledge of that will, of which there is no sign in his Politique. But how, in any case, can conformity to the will of God be a matter of more or less? Is it possible that God only creates monarchies when political conditions on earth allow him to do so? The problem comes up with regard to the argument from nature that I will consider later. Some writers say flatly that republican or mixed regimes are unnatural, even monstrous, but Bossuet calls monarchy only "the most natural" regime, arguing from the frequency of its appearance in history - as if the daisy were said to be more natural than some rare species of orchid. Behind these improb- able assertions there stands a vision rather than an argument, a vision of the state as a reflection of God's universe, a microcosm which can indeed take different forms but which reaches perfec- tion only when it is presided over by an image of divinity. God's presence is not guaranteed by the mere existence of a ruling will - hence the political neutrality of the idea of sovereignty - but only by an actual or symbolic embodiment of his person in human flesh, that is, only by a king. The king's "resemblance" to God is one of the oldest and most common themes of Christian political thought, the basis of all historically specific assertions of divine right. The most famous of these is that of James I, which differs from earlier versions not in its listing of the parallel attributes of God and king, but in its insistence upon the descent of the divine resemblance through the blood royal and in its assimilation of the legal doctrine of absolute sovereignty. In his edition pf James's Political Works, C. H. Mcllwain rightly fixes on all that was new in the king's position (or new to common lawyers and parliamentarians) and argues that the attempt to act out divine and hereditary sovereignty as James conceived it made the revolution "almost inevitable." 28 That it made some sort of resistance to the king highly probable is probably true. It should also be said that the underlying doc- 27 Bossuet, Politique, p. 63. 28 Political Works of James I, p. xl.</page><page sequence="20">636 SOCIAL RESEARCH trine of Christian kingship made the appearance of theories like James's equally probable. Kantorowicz has demonstrated the long pedigree of some of his most provocative assertions and also, more importantly, of the metaphors and symbols within which his innovations fit so neatly. It required only a king (or a would- be king) with intellectual as well as divine pretensions to seize the opportunity offered by the old ideas. (In fact, it required less than that, for in France similar doctrines were put forward by jurists, ministers, and court preachers.) When James made his claims, he also made divine right more vulnerable than it had ever been before, not because he screwed it to its highest pitch, but because some of his subjects no longer believed it at any pitch. "A king is a thing," John Seiden said (but did not write), "men have made for their own sakes, for quietness' sake. Just as in a family one man is appointed to buy the meat." 29 This is a far greater innovation than any argument put forward by James I, and its radical denial of any sort of divine resemblance has more to do with the "inevitability" of the revolu- tion than the novelty of the king's claim to divine sovereignty. Many years before, Richard II apparently believed and acted upon views something like those of the first Stuart, though he unhappily wrote no books. But if some of his subjects were ready to risk offending the divine image in his person, they at least lied about what they were doing and so simultaneously paid tribute to that very image. They did not think Richard a "thing," nor would they have said that Bolingbroke was newly chosen to buy the meat. And so they made no revolution. Revolutions come when the old regime is attacked in its fundamentals, not in the most recent exag- gerations or absurdities of its leaders and spokesmen. What was fundamental to divine right was the notion that the king was somehow godlike. That gave him a reason for pretend- ing to political omnipotence (and no reason for not pretending), but it required him to assert only his difference from other men 29 John Seiden, Table Talk, edited by Sir Frederick Pollock (London: Quaritch, 1927), p. 61.</page><page sequence="21">REGICIDE AND REVOLUTION 637 and not any particular doctrine of state power. "A subject and a sovereign are clean different things," Charles I bravely an- nounced on the scaffold, though he knew his head would drop like any other man's.30 He was not pointing - as even Seiden might have done - to a functional distinction. He meant to describe a personal difference. We can best get at the nature of that difference by turning immediately to the consecration cere- mony that was once thought to establish it. The anointing of the king by a bishop of the church was probably the most im- portant ritual of Christian monarchy. It has its origins as a Christian rite in the time of Charlemagne, and with it comes also, as Fritz Kern has pointed out, the all-important phrase announc- ing that the anointed king rules "by the grace of God." 31 Not that God's grace moved the bishop to perform the ceremony; the king himself did that. What God did was actually to perform the miracle that the anointing symbolized. "The grace of God hath this day changed thee into another man, and by the holy rite of unction hath made thee partaker in its divinity" - so the arch- bishop of Mainz spoke to the new German king.32 The rite was thought in those early times to be a sacrament, and the new ruler, as a result of the mysterious transformation that it effected or proclaimed, emerged as a priest-king, an adopted son of God and of the church, different from ordinary Christians because of his priesthood, different from other priests because of his kingship. The Gregorian revolution in the church succeeded in abolish- ing the king's priesthood and in denying the sacramental character of royal unction. Gregory and his successors insisted that the king was a layman, inferior to the lowest cleric in the spiritual hierarchy. It would have been a greater victory (and regicide might have been unnecessary later) had they succeeded as well 30 Muddiman, Trial of Charles the First, p. 262. 3i Fritz Kern, Ktngshtp and Law m the Middle Ages, translated by a.

As it was, the church lost control over the mystery of kingship; the fact that the king was now less than priestly did not make him in his own or in his subjects' eyes less than godlike.33 "The divinity that doth hedge a king" became for the church militant as well as for later revolutionaries a superstition - though this was a superstition from which local church officials could rarely dissociate themselves. Carolingian kings had argued that they received from the anointing "a quality that could not be taken away without the verdict of the church. " When the church's verdict was to take it away, not from this or that king, but from kings in general, the argument shifted. Richard II believed more simply that "his hallowing was indelible": 34 Not all the water in the rough rude sea Can wash the balm off from an anointed king. If this was right, if there was no possibility of an ecclesiastical impeachment, then any attack on the king was an attack also on the divinity in which he partook. Opposition to kings was rebellion against God, who had not merely appointed them but who had also invested them with something of his own divinity. Hence the religious abhorrence in which rebels were held, at least by kings and their supporters, and the tendency of defeated kings (from Richard to Charles and Louis) to identify themselves with the God who died and to make of their defeat a Passion. There is probably something in the hatred we still feel for traitors that derives from that religious identification, though it is much easier to call the king's enemy a Judas than to apply that name to an enemy of the impersonal and secular state. The pope, it should be said again, denied the identification altogether and sanctioned rebellion, when he thought it in the church's interest, simply by freeing subjects from their oath of allegiance. He did 33 For a time, however, a lesser oil was used in the consecration of the king than in the anointing of a priest (Schramm, English Coronation, pp. 127-128). 3* So he told Chief Justice Thirning in 1399, who presumably did not agree (bteel, Richard II, p. 284).</page><page sequence="23">REGICIDE AND REVOLUTION 639 not feel it necessary to wash off the balm, since he did not rec- ognize its sacramental quality. It is interesting to note that it was not until 1682 that the French king succeeded in definitively repudiating the pope's right to release his subjects from obedi- ence.85 Long before that, however, political theology had tri- umphed over theology itself and given the king a divine status that the pope could not hope to challenge. He could inspire occasional assassins, but not revolutionaries. The most extraordinary, though not the most important, power derived from the indelible hallowing of the king - and ritually acted out by French and English rulers from the early Middle Ages until the revolutionary years - was the power to heal men and women suffering from scrofula, the King's Evil. This ability, unique to kings, was sometimes quietly, sometimes vociferously denied by the Gregorian popes and their publicists. It might nevertheless be said to represent the (self-imposed) limit of royalist ideology, for it involved no priestly power: the king claimed to heal bodies, not to cure souls. The Roman objection was to the fact that he did not also claim to be especially skillful (even by the grace of God) in the practice of medicine. His work was entirely miraculous. In performing it, he literally acted the part of God, without claiming to be God but also without the media- tion of a clerical servant. "Le roi te touche, Dieu te guérit!' Marc Bloch is surely right to let this miracle stand for all the mysteries of kingship. Though it does not suggest an application of divine mercy to political life itself - the king does not similarly heal the ills of the body politic - the ritual touching of thousands of assembled subjects is obviously a matter of political significance. The Long Parliament recognized this when in 1647 it took up again, all unknowing, the work of Hildebrandine monks and appointed a committee to prepare "a Declaration ... to the People, concerning the superstition of being touched for the healing of the King's Evil." 8e 35 The Political Works of James I, p. lxix, n. 36 Bloch, Les rois thaumaturges, p. 374.</page><page sequence="24">640 SOCIAL RESEARCH Despite its efforts, touching for scrofula was restored along with Charles II, and that king and his brother touched their subjects at an unprecedented rate, as if seeking through the old ritual to regain all the other features of their divine resemblance. William of Orange and then the Hanoverians gave up the attempt; they were not restored but simply postrevolutionary kings, without pretensions to sacral kingship. In France too, before the revolu- tion, faith was waning and even the faith of the royal miracle- workers themselves. Bloch notes a revealing shift to the condi- tional in the formula spoken by the king: "Le roi te touche, Dieu te guérisse" 37 Nevertheless, Louis XVI touched 2,400 devout and hopeful men and women on the day after his consecration in 1775, and apparently continued the practice until he became, briefly, a constitutional monarch. His election by the French people was no renewal of his mysterious powers. He is the last of the thaumaturgie kings. If kings defied Rome by remaining godlike and working miracles long after the papacy claimed a monopoly on religious mystery, they also defended the church and even the faith, in part because they thought themselves godlike. They seized the opportunities, but also accepted the responsibilities, entailed by their divine resemblance. So they would have said, at any rate, and in the case of the last two kings the assertion has some truth. Both Charles and Louis were obviously more interested in being Christian kings than in being rois medicins, though the two identities were, as we have seen, ideologically connected. The decline of Roman power and the rise of something like national states had enabled the kings of England and France to reclaim their religious offices as the natural corollary of the sacral character they had never lost. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, they made their countries' churches effectively their own, royal eigenkirchen, and justified their new power by refer- 3T Ibid., p. 403. The decline of faith is more harshly revealed by Voltaire's com- ment that Louis XIV could not heal one of his mistresses, though she had been "très bien touchée" (ibid., p. 398).</page><page sequence="25">REGICIDE AND REVOLUTION 641 enee to their age-old representation of God (and touched the scrofulous to prove the title). The priest-king returned, though without canonical justification or sacramental power. Thus the English king came to call himself not only Defender of the Faith - a title first granted by the pope, who did not foresee that the faith might be defended against himself - but also Head of the Church, whose body, it must be remembered, was still regarded as the Body of Christ. He did not thereby call himself a god; these were Christian kings. But he did claim, once again, to act in God's place and with something of his character. This was a claim that Charles I took very seriously. More than any other royal pretension, it stood in the way of a political accommodation with Parliament. The king vacillated and lied, even signed a treaty with the Scots that committed him to ecclesi- astical reforms he clearly found repugnant, but he probably did ultimately place a higher price on his religious than on his physi- cal body.38 The case was similar in France, though Louis was even less resolute. The French king, according to royal publicists of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, was "chef et premiere personne ecclésiastique" He was given the (honorary) title "Christ" by Bossuet, called "sacred" both because of his unction and his duty as "representative of the divine majesty." 39 It is hard to be sure what Louis himself believed and impossible to doubt his private modesty, yet, like his English predecessor, he tried to live up to the responsibilities thus imposed on him by God and the ideology of kingship. Hence his abhorrence of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, the greatest affront of the revolu- tion, not perhaps to his regal power but to his personal dignity. Both English and French revolutionaries sought to attack the church while still bargaining with the king. The king's sense of himself made that extraordinarily difficult: the church was, like ss See the Eikon Basilike, which I shall take, following its most recent editor, to be based on a substantial "core of material" composed by the king himself: Eikon Basilike, edited by Philip A. Knachel (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1966).

To touch the church was to lay hands on the king's extended body, while he could not withdraw from the religious establishment he headed without leaving some substantial part of his kingship behind. One should add that this was true only in a manner of speaking, but that is the manner in which kings actually spoke. Once again, the crucial point here is not the degree of ecclesiasti- cal power claimed by any particular king. That varied a great deal, depending on the relative balance of forces within the church and the state. What is important is the claim of virtually every king, or every Christian king, to partake in divine authority, to be an image and deputy of God.40 Then the church and state that he embodied partook in turn of the inequality he represented, and bishops and secular lords too ruled as lieutenants of a Captain who sometimes had, in their case, a proper as well as an ineffable name. The old regime was peopled with 'little gods" and with their retinues of servants and subjects. 40 Geoffrey Elton has argued that "religion formed the ceremonial dress rather than the passionate essence of post-medieval kings by right divine" (see Elton's introduction to the Harper Torchbook edition of Figgis's Divine Right of Kings [New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1965], p. xxi). Perhaps; but one would have to stress how important it is that kings not be naked. * From Regicide and Revolution by Michael Walzer, Professor of Government, Harvard University. © 1974 Cambridge University Press.</page></plain_text>
