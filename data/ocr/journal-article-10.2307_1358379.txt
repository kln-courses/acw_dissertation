<plain_text><page sequence="1">P 0 R T R A I T S JUNE WAYNE'S QUANTUM AESTHETICS By Ruth Weisberg When looking back over June Wayne's more than 50 years as a practicing artist, one finds lifelong impulses, understandings, and quests. Her art defies simple categorization. In fact, the artist sees her work as "not really being of different peri- ods. I think the sensibility is the same, right from the beginning."' Wayne's art has been animated by an awareness that there is no border between the human organism and the rest of nature-all are part of the same "molecular dance." Wayne is deductive, intuiting the whole from an investigation of the smallest modules or invisible forces. Her desire is not "to illustrate new physical theories but to invent metaphors that expand aesthetic sensibilities."2 An artists' advocate, organizer, essayist, and respected intel- lectual, Wayne is perhaps best known as the founder in 1960 of the Tamarind Lithography Workshop, which was instrumental in reviving the art of lithography in the United States. Born June Clair Kline in 1918, she states with humor: "If it had not been for the war, I might not ever have 'happened' since my mother met my father by writing a letter to this unknown soldier.... It was part of the 'pen pal' program of the government." The marriage between Dorothy Kline and Albert Lavine ended soon after June's birth, and she had no contact with her father again until the late 1950s. Reared in a matriarchal household, from earliest childhood she felt like an outsider. As she explained, "To be a wage earner and divorced in those days was tough. All my life my mother was 'Miss Kline' because divorcees were apt to lose their jobs or not to be hired at all.'"3 The household included her grandmother, Florence, who had been only 18 when Dorothy was born. Dorothy worked as a bookkeeper, a credit manager, and finally, for 25 years, as a traveling corset saleswoman for the Bien Jolie Company, handling the Chicago territory, which included Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. Florence had come to the United States from Russia, circa 1906, with daughters Dorothy and Helen, a son Paul, and a nephew Rudolf, to join her husband, who, in typical immigrant fashion, had preceded her by several years. Close-knit, with a deep sense of family pride--"we were all pearls beyond price"-they tended to view the world from an "us" and "them" perspective. Many aspects of June Wayne's personality seem to have been shaped by her family's deliberate isolation as well as the strength of each family member. All had unique creative, intellectual, or political enthusiasms; for example, Dorothy declaimed poetry "a la Sarah Bernhardt," and Paul was part of the early labor movement. Florence was a skilled seamstress, and the family pride was also manifest in the elegant manner in which this immigrant family managed to dress. Wayne's inimitable personal style, which includes wearing knickers and overblouses, often fabri- cated in Japanese or other ethnic fabrics, was shaped during her childhood. "As I look back at old photographs, I under- stand why I dress the way I do. I remember one outfit that I wore, brown velvet knickers with a brown velvet overblouse, like a tunic...and a brown velvet tam-o'-shanter with a ribbon and black ballet-type slippers." The family distanced itself from its Jewish heritage. Wayne vividly remembers her grandfa- ther's funeral, even though she was only six. Her grandmother stood beside the grave, shaking her fist at the sky and shouting, "You son of a bitch! Son of a bitch to do such a thing to this fine man, this wonderful man. I'll never forgive you." Her grandmother remained angry at God until the day she died. In 1930, when June was twelve, the family moved from the working-class Logan Square neighborhood to Chicago's more fashionable north side. By this time she had already expressed an interest in art. In fact, at age nine she began an illuminated manuscript of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, a project she continued into her late teens. The discovery of the Rubaiyat in the family library and the subsequent acquisition of skills in illumination without formal lessons set a lifelong pattern of personal investigation in place of more conventional schooling. In her early teens June met a group of musicians eight to ten years older than she, among them composer Bernard Brindel and concert pianist Saul Dorfman. They helped shape her intellectual and creative life. A voracious reader, she spent her time at the Clark Street Branch of the Public Library rather than in school. In fact, she left Senn High School in her junior year and at 15 started a truly independent life. June did, however, pass the University of Chicago entrance exams to prove to her mother that she could go to college. Her relation- ship to books, music, and art were all well established by her mid-teens, but she traces her first aesthetic impulses to a reve- lation she had reading the Sunday paper in early childhood: I remember that day lying on my stomach, reading the funnies. I realized that you could make one word into two words, and the other thing that I noticed that same day was that the colors in the funnies were all made of little dots and that green was really yel- low and blue dots.... These were two big "aha" experiences. June proceeded to make drawings from colored dots, and even today she creates large images from small textures and modules. The texture and density of her lithographs vividly recall this childhood experience. In 1935, using the name "June Clair," the young artist exhib- ited her drawings and figurative watercolors at the Boulevard Gallery, Diana Court, in Chicago. A representative from the Mexican Department of Education saw the exhibition and invited her to Mexico City to paint and exhibit her work. She accepted, but as a young American woman on her own she felt at odds with the Mexican machismo of that time. Upon return- ing to Chicago, she became director of Marshall Field's Modern Art Gallery, and in 1938 she joined the Chicago WPA Art Project as an easel artist, an experience that redirected her life. For the first time she felt part of a group-one with com- mon problems but also with shared goals. All the art programs were centered in one building. Artists requisitioned materials, went home and painted, and then brought in their finished work, at which time they were issued another canvas and began the cycle again. One could see WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL SPRING/SUMMER 1990</page><page sequence="2">foor. Fig. 1. June Wayne, The Chase (1949), oil on canvas, 20" x 80". Artist's Collection. artists coming from all directions, converging on the WPA proj- ect building. "I used to think of us as little sailing vessels as we tacked and sailed our canvases because of the wind in Chicago.... Congress thought it was relief. We thought it was work.... We saw ourselves as the cultural soldiers of the coun- try ... the mark of civilization and all that." Unfortunately, there was no effort to place or preserve the work and most of it has been lost or destroyed. Among her colleagues at this time were artists Julio de Diego, Mitchell Siporin, Edward Millman, Sidney Loeb, Gertrude Abercrombie, and Margo Hoff, and writers Meyer Levin, James T. Farrell, Saul Bellow, and Richard Wright. Photographer Peter Pollack, head of the WPA Art Centers, was a special friend. In the spirit of solidarity, many of them partic- ipated in an Artists' Union, and June Clair was among the artists who went to Washington, D.C., to lobby on behalf of the art projects. Then, as now, Congress was under pressure to do away with artist and writer projects. Like many other Depression-era artists, during the late 1930s June painted steel mills and factories and the Chicago River. The paintings were constructed of broken patches of subdued color, mostly black, ochre, muted blue, and beige, with touches of white. During the war June moved to New York City, where she designed buttons, jewelry, belts, and orna- ments. She then moved to California, where she learned pro- duction illustration, translating blueprints into spatial illustra- tions so that unskilled aircraft workers could visualize what they were building. In 1942 she returned to Chicago, where she became staff writer for radio station WGN. Throughout, she continued to paint and exhibit in group shows. In 1941 she had married George Wayne, a flight surgeon, shortly before he was sent to Burma-India, and in 1944 their daughter Robin Claire was born. According to Wayne, she did not find herself as an artist until after the war, when the family moved to Los Angeles. It was at that time, she explained, that "my brain connected with my hands." Her art, then and now, "represents an arena of control, an arena of choice that is so exhilarating, so refreshing, and so constructive." The work of this generative period was influenced conceptually by her wartime training in production illustration, which had introduced her "to the rules of perspec- tive, and the rules of perspective it turns out are not really rules at all.... It's a system that only works within a very narrow range and almost immediately you have to start cheating on the lines in order to make it look right." Through this work the artist gained a crucial awareness of the physiology of vision. "What focal vision and peripheral vision mean and the relation- ship of focal vision to movement and to time-this equation has been part of my work ever since." In her biography of the artist, Mary W. Baskett suggests that the synthesis of Wayne's optical and artistic interests took place during a high speed ride through the Second Street Tunnel in Los Angeles: The breakup offorms rushing by the open car window contrast- ed vividly with the stationary focal point at the tunnel's end.... [Wayne] thereby postulated the idea that the physiology of focal versus peripheral vision probably contained clues to a new method for presenting the illusion of movement.5 The Cavern Series of oil paintings from the late 1940s reveals both a dark locus of attention and aspects of peripheral vision. In a somewhat later lithograph titled The Tunnel #2 (1951), a textured vortex pulls the viewer's eye toward the black entrance of the tunnel. Wayne was also concerned with building a lexicon of sym- bols. She employed literary sources, especially a Proustian con- cept of time and a Kafkaesque use of symbols. For example, in her painting The Chase (1949; Fig. 1) bands of biomorphic sym- bols create an enigmatic narrative. One shape is transformed into another as it travels across the canvas exchanging character- istics. Spirals transmute first into mushroom caps and finally into flagellum. The organization of the symbols into narrative strips also relates to Wayne's long interest in text, and when "reading" these works, one becomes aware of the actual passage of time. Critic Jules Langsner called Wayne's anthropomorphic vocabulary "a landscape inhabited by a race of (at first glance, cryptic) creatures who are envisioned poetically, and who, as you become acquainted with them, are seen to be viable sym- bols of the human situation."" In the late 1940s Wayne began to work in lithography, ini- tially using Californian Lynton Kistler as her printer. In her first lithographs she became involved in building a language-creating a lexicon of images. In speaking of the print Kafka Symbols (1949), Wayne commented: I was interested in ... whether you could take the same symbol and by the way you treat it utterly change its emotional impact.... So there are a number of works that came out of that one print of the Kafka Symbol ... and they are utterly different each time although they use the same symbols.... I think of those Japanese toys where you drop a little object into water and all of a sudden it opens up and it's a tree or something. I like to do work that opens up like that ... but I want those flow- erings to be paradoxical in nature because it's in the paradox usually that the scope of the work can expand and resonate. O</page><page sequence="3">During the late 1940s and 1950s, Wayne felt like she was living two separate lives, the external one a facade, the stereo- typical life of a wife and mother, and the inner one, the vivid life of the creative artist. She slept very little in order to work on her art at night. She missed the collegiality and freedom she knew in the WPA and during the war. The sense of facade or faceted armor is captured in The Dreamers, a 1952 oil painting, and in Eve Tentee and Adam en Attente, lithographs from 1958. Her real preoccupations and ideas she discussed with a few close friends: scientist Harold Jacobson, whom she had known in Chicago, writer Abe Aaron, and poet and critic Jules Langsner. Although she had a lot of women friends, none were accessible. Like Wayne, they were constrained by family responsibilities. Wayne was keenly aware of the problems faced by women artists: Artists who were women simply became invisible.... In 1953 the Museum of Modern Art bought one of my prints for 15 dollars. A triumph! I had some museum shows that looked good in my biography, but I had no dealers; collectors tended not to buy art made by women, and it never occurred to me to apply for a teaching job.... Artists who were women were simply not hired.7 Nevertheless, during the 1950s Wayne had solo exhibitions in such prestigious venues as The Art Institute of Chicago (1952); M.H. De Young Museum, San Francisco (1956); Santa Barbara Museum of Art (1953 and 1958); and the Los Angeles County Museum (1959). By the mid-1950s, frustrated by the limited technical knowl- edge of American lithographic printers, Wayne began experi- menting with ways of working with pen and crayon to enrich the surfaces of her prints. She rubbed, scratched, and spat- tered to build up texture. For example, for The Jurj (1953; Fig. 2), from her Justice Series, she used fine sand particles on the stone to stop-out or block successive layers of sprayed liq- uid tusche (lithographic drawing ink). This procedure, which results in diffused points of light suggesting a starry sky, in the artist's words, was "a means to irradiate the picture plane."" With her use of objectified, impersonal "jurists" and cosmic ambience, Wayne, in The Jury, questions the nature of judg- ment and the concepts of guilt and innocence. Around this time, Wayne saw La Mdtropolitaine, a print by artist Mario Avati, at the Museum of Modern Art. Struck by the exceptional quality of the printed washes, she determined to locate Avati and discover the name of his printer. She found the artist in Paris, and in 1957 she spent two months working with his printer, Marcel Durassier. Durassier was at first suspicious of Wayne-"He didn't believe that women could make lithographs." The shop conditions on Rue Cassett were primitive: It was a tiny place in a courtyard. It had no running water-only the spigot in the courtyard-and one light bulb like that ghastly light bulb that hangs down in Guernica.... He had a sack of coal and above it a tin can with a rubber tube coming from it.... That's how he grained the stones. However, Wayne returned to Paris in 1958, and with Durassier created her book, Songs and Sonnets, John Donne, in an exhila- rating 70 days and nights. In the lithographs for Songs and Sonnets, John Donne, Wayne created visual metaphors for the 17th-century poet's ?; ~7~ ;z ::?: i?f:LV :' .;? ;1 'J ~4?( i 1... :"Y ' '" '" ,- ?? ;4' .;d._. .^ .. .Li .?I'~S? ;?t~9~ 'L~~asr -------- 9~31 ~ir*l*- I'L~pk.rsE*-~C~e~ :?;-? ?:, r ,J ?,, &gt;."?'i~: i"2r;`-?l*' ?r? ir ~1 r ?3 :` "i:7ij 4 .. ,t .r r I?`~ :~t-~ ;?. ;? j?'~ c~ .. r?= c .`i 7 g -ai: ; t": i : r; " .: ;7:C, 2% *?~ ~ii~PQj 'C- Y'~-T:.~?;?it:r??i~ t- 5:? ?: -? r'ct~ ??(? r- ;r e~ I?,:Z~?~j"~ :* ?~~*? ~ I?ri ?r ?-. ?: ??I i- : : Y: (?-~ ? ,I?~~?~. :~?~ :..~ ??-?? rf :~~?-?."

Both poet and artist paradoxically combine the sensual with a highly developed sense of intellec- tual play. In her images for the book she again employed a field that seems to coalesce from smaller modules, in this case points of light. Male and female bodies intertwine amid galac- tic storms or cloudy atmospheres. By incorporating tusche washes and airbrushing over bits of natural debris, Wayne pushed the art of lithography to a new level of sophistication. In The Canonization, the figures are barely discernable as they dissolve into the sparks of light they have generated. In these John Donne lithographs, Wayne has dematerialized the human being while at the same time making the tessellation of the sur- face more palpable. This work exemplifies Wayne's belief that there is no fixed boundary between human beings and the rest of nature-all meld in a molecular dance. Foreshadowing her development over the next few years was her sensuous and evocative depiction of space. In the John Donne lithographs and in her paintings of the mid-1950s such as The Messenger, her imagery suggests heavenly fires and the infinity of space in relationship to irradiated and evanescent figures. By At Last a Thousand (1965), the specifics of figuration have disappeared; all that remains is the whirling cosmos. The viewer becomes a traveler amid the dazzling changes of texture and surface created through Wayne's mastery of lithography. When the artist returned from her second Parisian trip, she separated from her husband and moved to a large studio on Tamarind Avenue in Los Angeles. Still concerned about the declining state of lithography in the United States and now aware of greater possibilities, Wayne appealed to W. McNeil Lowry of the Ford Foundation to fund what became the Tamarind Lithography Workshop. She wrote: A handful of creative people is all that is needed for a renais- sance in an art, if that handful comes together at the right time, in the right place. Half a dozen master printers, scattered around the United States, with a cluster of artists revolving around each, could cause a resurgence and a blossoming-forth of the art of lithography that would attract the interest of the world. Everything she had done before seems to have prepared her for her role as founder and first director of Tamarind: her WPA participation in Chicago gave her insights into the nature of large-scale art projects; her jewelry design in New York and production illustration in Los Angeles helped her understand the process nature of lithography; her lobbying for the Artist's Union in Washington, D.C., and radio scriptwriting in Chicago developed her skills in working with groups and with mass media. Not only was Tamarind generously fimunded, it was amblitious. Wayne's vision of an "ecology of the print" incorporated a whole team of people. First she obtained grants for artists and print- ers, then for curatorial training and public education. The group published fact sheets, developed light-fast ink, and iden- tified sources of supply. Wayne set high standards for both artists and printers and engaged in long-term planning that took into account sociological and political consequences."' Wayne's commitment to Tamarind was extraordinary, but the demands of its success reduced her own art output to about two prints a year. Still, prints like Tenth Memory (1961) and At Last a Thousand (1965) reveal the core of her vision. In her Deluge Series from the mid-1960s, Wayne, like Leonardo, is dealing with the structure of matter and the spa- tial dimensions of both our minds and the physical uni- verse-a kind of quantum aesthetics. During the Tamarind years (in 1964), Wayne married actor Arthur Henry (Hank) Plone, now retired, whom she still refers to as one of the most handsome men she ever met. By the late 1960s, changes in tax laws made it appropriate for Wayne to find a university sponsor for her nonprofit work- shop. When Tamarind moved to the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, in 1970, Wayne turned to other ambi- tious projects. These included the Oscar-nominated documen- tary film Four Stones for Kanemitzu, the Joan of Arc Workshops-which were a formative influence on the Southern California feminist art community-and collabora- tion with French tapestry weavers. With weaving, which is "intensive, rhythmical, and slow," Wayne found a way "to transmit to the viewer a sense of time passing."" She also for the first time worked on a grand scale. Her ten-foot long and six-and-a-half foot wide Verdict (1971) is structured like an early Gothic tapestry. The composition, which is divided into two unequal sections, has a narrow top band crowned by a twisted strand of colored beads-the dou- ble helix of the genetic code. Below, "bits and points of intense hues mingle among neutrals, building color atmospherically and perceptually.""' The surface is animated by Wayne's "points of light." She constant duality in Wayne's art is her involvement with both impersonal nature and personal narrative. What joins these two great strands in the artist's oeuvre is her awareness of the vantage point of the artist. In the 1970s Wayne's use of sci- entific sources such as the genetic code, the splitting of the atom, and the exploration of galactic space in works like the O</page><page sequence="5">Burning Helix Series and in Tidal Waves freed the viewer to travel in an imagined universe. Even in early paintings like The Chase (1949) and The Elements (1951), the artist explored new structural and literary--even cinematographic-means to express events in time and space, but the narrative remained elusive. In the 20 lithographs from the 1970s Dorothy Series, which represent her mother's life, the narrative is specific. This visual biography is told as much as possible from the point of view of its subject. Wayne's desire to suppress her own perspective springs from an earlier lithograph, Dorothy, the Last Day (1960), which was done shortly after her mother's death. Wayne commented: "It was reproduced in Time magazine without my permission, and I was horrified. I knew that Dorothy would have hated it-to be revealed in such a desper- ate and private moment. So I said to myself, 'O.K., Dorothy, someday I'll make it up to you.'"''3 The lithographs were not produced according to Dorothy Kline's chronology. Last Time, from the mid-1970s, is now the 19th print in the series. In the midst of a silvery gray void appear two objects: a never-cashed birthday check to June from her mother and a necklace of beads. The look of this print and its reference to personal history formed the basis for the series. The conceptual problem for Wayne was one of iconography, choosing just the right ensemble of objects, text, and incidents from very complex referential sources. For Wayne, the use of documents and centered, frontal compositions creates distance and detachment, while the subjective use of color in transparent layers of ink adds emotional resonance. The dramatic portrait of Dorothy in 25 Years With the Firm (1976; Fig. 3) is set against the grid of a chic, 1957 girdle ad. She is a handsome, self-assured woman, but the palette has shifted from the bright spring colors of the early prints to blue and an intense, somber red. The text of a letter reads, "My dear: I've not had a happy time of it this trip. My 25 years with the firm was celebrated in a crude, utterly unthinking manner.... I feel like Willie Loman." In these prints Wayne gives us her mother's voice, clear and direct, and in the end there is a sense of the full circle of life. The last lithograph, Goodbye, is not a desperate and private image. Using her mother's strong profile, honed sharp by ill- ness, in a setting of fragile grays and brave pinks, Wayne expresses her mother's pride, determination, and style. Viewers of the Dorothy Series sometimes bring to it their own nostalgic associations. The real triumph of the series is the artist's restraint, sustained viewpoint, emphasis on referen- tial content, and masterful use of formal qualitiessuch as scale, color, and placement that unifies the many narrative voices and adds psychological vibration to each image. Since the Dorothy Series, Wayne has completed four other lithographic series, Stellar Winds, My Palomar, Solar Flares, and most recently, the Sagh Series, all of which explore "the ineffably beautiful but hostile wilderness of astrophysical space."'4 In the works from My Palomar, in contrast to the unanchored viewpoint of the free-floating viewer, we seem to be looking back toward the earth through a variety of lenses. A shifting sense of scale and perspective help us to understand the crucial role of frame of reference. Twinight (1984; Fig. 4), from this series, contains a blue square, which rides on a field that shifts easily in our perception from solid ridges to watery ground. This and the other works in My Palomar reveal the artist's exceptional use of nuanced color expressed through veils of lithographic ink. In 1973 the Municipal Art Gallery, Barnsdall Park, Los Angeles, mounted a retrospective of June Wayne's work. After a period of deliberately withdrawing from public exposure Wayne is again exhibiting widely. Since the early 1980s she has had major solo exhibitions at the Jewish Museum, New York; the Grunwald Center for the Graphic Arts, UCLA; Galerie des Femmes, Paris; the Fresno Art Museum; and the Armstrong Gallery and Associated American Artists, both in New York City. Now in her seventies, June Wayne continues to push the boundaries of art. In her lithographs from the last several years, her command of the medium has allowed an inspired playfulness. Gesture becomes sign; sign becomes enigmatic text; text becomes a limitless cosmic force field. In Green Edge I and Green Edge II (both 1986), from the Sagh Series, the color and form have the evanescent presence of constantly decaying information from a scientific scanning device. Sagheye II and Saghex II, both 1987, make use of powerful ambiguities. We sense in the gesture the warmth of the artist's hand and in the underlying geometry the impersonality of a force of nature. Wayne comments, "I am really much more willing to show the sign of the human hand, my hand. In a way, they're more expressionist. I'm beginning to put the 'I' into the equation." In other innovative pieces Wayne bridges previously separate approaches to lithography and painting by collaging rectangular silver elements onto lithographic images. The technically innovative Distant Black Action (1989; front cover), for example, is a three-dimensional buildup of litho- graphic collage and acrylic paint on a mahogany field. Its com- position echoes both the cross hairs in a rifle and the cross marks by which space is mapped, and its textural buildup gives the sense of three different levels of space-the distant, medi- um-distant, and close-in. Wayne's work no longer represents optical knowledge; it creates optical experiences. What Arlene Raven wrote earlier about Wayne's paintings could refer to these more recent works as well: She was fascinated by the exchange of energy and matter in Leonardo's work. She has expressed the same exchange in her simultaneously ethereal and concrete forms-as incarnate and in-themselves rather than as once-removed illustrations of imagined metaphysical regions. Refusing to take up the old dualism between the material and immaterial, this artist has, instead, sought to traverse a greater and more profoundly vast physical reality.'5 Several of Wayne's articles, among them "The Male Artist as Stereotypical Female," have become touchstones for artists and scholars.'6 She was invited to give the convocation address at the 1990 College Art Association meetings, a singular honor for an artist. In her lectures and writing Wayne always has a refreshingly independent, even debunking, point of view. Her wit tends to sabotage the conventional niceties the public might expect. For example, at the celebration of Tamarind's 25th Anniversary Exhibition at UCLA, she gently mocked the audience: And let me not forget the Tamarind brood for whom I am the Eternal Registrar, poised to endorse their Guggenheims. I did not agree to endless bondage when I came aboard, and this may explain why I am irritable, even on this grand occasion when I ought to smile and bow like a duchess."7 WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL SPRING/SUMMER 1990</page><page sequence="6">Although the leadership and vision that June Wayne has continuously given to the art world are extraordinary-witness her crucial involvement in the recent drive to amend the tax laws for artists and writers-she is not comfortable revealing her generosity. A reticence, a reluctance to be vulnerable, is part of that need to remain somewhat apart-to be the specta- tor. This slightly distanced point of view, this vantage point, allows her to look back at the earth to observe the pleasures, terrors, and surprises of the human condition and to look beyond to the windstorms and solar flares of deep space. Like the poetry of John Donne, June Wayne's art is the reconcilia- tion of the sensual, the imaginative, and the rational. Her work represents the singular merging of a love of richly articulated surfaces, emotional restraint, a disciplined hand, and a con- stantly questing mind. * NOTES 1.
