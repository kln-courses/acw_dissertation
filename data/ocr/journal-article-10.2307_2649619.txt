Walters, who distinguished himself with ear- lier work on the American Deists and how Enlighten- ment thought penetrated strands of American religion, offers the first full-length analysis of Benjamin Frank- lin's religion in more than thirty years. His work is revisionist; at the outset, he states his intent to counter the prevailing understanding developed by Alfred Owen Aldridge in Benjamin Franklin and Nature's God (1967). Aldridge argued that Franklin was an idiosyncratic deist who espoused a kind of polytheism. Walters does not deny the existence of an idiosyncratic dimension to Franklin's thought but counters that it leads to a theistic perspectivism, not polytheism. Both acknowl- edge that Franklin's religious insights evolved through- out his long life, always reacting against the Calvinism proffered by Franklin's parents. Walters fixes on key documents to make his case, beginning with the Dissertation oni Liberty and Neces- sity, PleasuXre anid Pain (1725). Published in England while Franklin was still a teenager, the treatise was starkly deistic in tone and content but strident in repudiating traditional Calvinistic understandings of Christianity. It represented a "false start," for Franklin quickly regretted what he wrote and moved in other directions. The next stage, pivotal for Walters's interpretation, was the "Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion" that Franklin prepared strictly for personal use. Franklin compiled this relatively short list of personal beliefs late in 1728, when he was twenty-two years old. It is in this very personal document that Walters finds Fran- klin's "great insight," what he terms theistic perspec- tivism. In a nutshell, Franklin posited the existence of God (at least in the sense of deism's First Cause) but remained convinced that the being of God was so fundamentally different from human being as to be always inaccessible to the human mind (reason) and emotions. Hence, ordinary folk developed a variety of ways to represent God symbolically, many of them anthropomorphic but some almost as lesser divinities. This last point is what led Aldridge to see Franklin as a polytheist, and it leads Walters to see Franklin as one who recognized that humans developed a range of ways to portray God, a variety of perspectives from which to describe deity. In other words, Franklin recognized that individuals would always fashion a variety of images in their attempts to capture the infinite in finite categories. Here Franklin sounds like the later American pragma- tists, a point that Walters notes. William James, for example, argued that in the absence of rational verifi- cation, the utility of a particular belief in endowing life with meaning (so long as it did not bring harm) made such belief plausible and worthy of acceptance. Frank- lin, according to Walters, would have concurred. As Franklin aged, he retained a concern for virtue and connections between religious belief and virtue. For Walters, this interest reflects Franklin's philosoph- ical posture. But it also had practical utility. Walters interprets passages in Franklin's Autobiography (1771- 1788) that were critical of Presbyterians and religious sects in general as indicative of Franklin's conviction that doctrinal particularity detracted from a philosoph- ical emphasis on virtue. It may be simpler than that. Like others inclined toward Enlightenment rational- ism, Franklin understood the social value of having citizens who shared common understandings of right and wrong. They were less likely to pose problems for social order and therefore would be easier to govern. George Washington articulated similar ideas about the social value of religion in his "Farewell Address." Walters connects Franklin's theological evolution with "stages of faith" advanced by James W. Fowler, who drew on theories of human development sug- gested by Erik Erikson and Jean Piaget. Fowler never strictly correlates stages of faith to chronological age, but it is rather striking that Franklin at age twenty-two should have arrived at the fifth stage, a conjunctive faith where one integrates personal identity with a specific religious outlook, aware of all the paradoxes it brings. For Fowler, this stage represents significant maturity for the individual, but a maturity rarely attained in young adulthood. Hence, although Walters's efforts to tie Franklin's belief to psycholog- ical stages of faith development are enticing, they may be a bit overstated. Nonetheless, Walters has provided a solid analysis, one sure to provoke reflection, and AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW OCTOBER 1999</page><page sequence="2">Canada and the United States 1297 those interested in American religious culture of the eighteenth century are once again in his debt.
