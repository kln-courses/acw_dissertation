But the sonorous combination seems to me to be a logical and unified one, particularly worth expos- ing in this country, where the smooth and refined saxophone playing practiced for some time in the art music of France ought to take its place alongside the lively and expressive playing of the American jazz tradition. The saxophone has been slow to assume a role of importance in what Tovey called the "main stream" of western music. When Adolphe Sax introduced the instrument to the Parisian public in the early 1840s, Hec- tor Berlioz, among others (Meyerbeer, Kastner, Spontini), became interested in its possibilities: not only did Berlioz describe the saxophone in a special chapter of his Traite dXistrumentation of 1843 ("fine and penetrating in the upper register, rich and velvety in the lower register . . . [a] deeply expressive [instrument]"), but also, in 1844, he arranged the Chant sacre (the sixth of his Neuf melodies irlandaises) as a sextet for two trumpets, two clarinets, bugle, and- making its first public appearance-saxo- phone. Still, with certain well known ex- ceptions, the instrument remains uncom- mon in "classical" music. The works of the five French composers represented here may, however, mark the beginning of a new trend. If so, credit must be given to the Quatuor d'Anches Francais (Paul Pareille, saxo- phone; Jacques Vandeville, oboe; Jean Claude Brion, clarinet; Daniel Neurauter, bassoon), the group for which these several works were specifically written. Jacques Bernard's Dialogue dAnches (1974) is in six sections (marked noncommittally A to F) which nicely alternate a full, four-voiced texture with a diminished one for one or two voices. The harmonic and melodic language here features the 2nds, tritones, 7ths, and 9ths that characterize traditional 12-tone usage, and it is the subtle interplay of changing rhythms and meters that is of greatest expressive value. Though written by a saxophonist-composer, this Dialogue is one among four quite equal voices, each equally demanding from a technical point of view. Denise Roger's Trois Mouvements (1974), essentially fast-slow-fast, features a less se- vere harmonic idiom- not tonal, though often centering upon the note E-with certain parallel sonorities sometimes sug- gestive of Debussy. With its rigorously maintained contrapuntal texture and suc- cessive points of imitation, the second movement here is the most intellectual one, and perhaps the most satisfying. The outer movements, with rhythmic gestures nor- mally conforming to the accents of the meter, are lively and varied and not beyond the capabilities of the fine student player. The Nocturne (1970) by Aubert Leme- land, Kuklos (1974) by Daniel Meier, and Hvele II by Marcel Goldmann have been recorded by the Quatuor d'Anches Francais on the Erato label (EFM 01 1) not yet availa- ble in this country. As the title suggests, the one-movement work by Lemeland (9 minutes-slow-fast-slow) is a somber, re- laxed, and carefully nuanced one: the har- monies -sometimes triadically altered and sometimes Tristanesque -are motivated by gentle contrapuntal lines occasionally orna- mented a la Chopin with rapid, improvisa- tory links between one strong beat and another. Daniel Meier's Greek title, Kuklos, has to do with Chinese philosophy, since the three sections of his quatuor d'anches are marked Yin, Yang, and Fecondation (ferti- lization). Suffice it to say that the final section combines the passive and feminine qualities traditionally (and unchauvinisti- cally) associated with the Yin (here, clus- tered harmonies and much heterophonic, ornamental, 'oriental' writing), with the ac- tive and masculine qualities associated with the Yang (here, short, machine-gun-like, sharply articulated and repetitive rhythmic patterns). This is a novel piece, not for the neophyte performer. Marcel Goldmann's Hevel II, another work with a mysterious title, is one of those do-it-yourself compositions consisting in this case of twenty-two "sequences" whose succession -to be determined before each performance -is not fixed by the compos- er. Each of the four instruments is provided with one solo sequence, and each has the "right," according to the directions, to one supplementary solo sequence (the order of which is again to be determined in advance by the performers). The motives to be played do not seem especially idiomatic to these four instruments: with their constant 410</page><page sequence="3">leaps and avoidance of line they seem ap- propriate more for the keyboard than for the reed. The composer does insist on close adherence to the expansive dynamic levels indicated, and here he happily recognizes the expressive importance, particularly in wind music, of maximizing the dynamic range of instruments which are too often played in the limited latitude of mezzo- piano to mezzo-forte. The sound of the quatuor d'anches is a distinctive one which bears cultivation. While it will never challenge the supremacy of the quatuor a cordes, it will provide the composer with a viable alternative to the polychromatic sonority of the woodwind quintet. It also will provide the saxophone player with new company in which -if he does so with discretion-to blow his horn. That the saxophone belongs in this company is indisputable: in the issue of The Neu, Yorker current at this writing (May 31, 1976) there is a drawing by Edward Koren of a smiling, anthropomorphic, and very furry tuba welcoming to his home a similarly furry trio of piccolo clarinet [baby], B-flat clarinet [mama], and saxophone [papa]. "Ah!" says the tuba, "It's the Woodwind family." PETER A. BLOOM Smith College</page></plain_text>
