Law resists the uncanny. The home is the exemplar of the uncanny. Two Supreme Court cases, decided four days apart, Kelo v. City of New London and Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, grapple with the uncanny home. Both reflect on the meanings of the home as simultaneously the source of security against and the focal point of anxieties about crossing between the categories of the private and the public. This essay traces the specter of doubleness that haunts the home in the law: the uncanny ways in which the home emerges as the exemplary private institution and the exem- plary public concern in our society.  Keywords: home, property, family, takings, eminent domain, domestic violence, restraining orders, due process, mandatory arrest, criminal law, police enforcement, uncanny, anxiety, horror, haunting, specter, private, public, class, Kelo v. City of New London; Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales. I N TRODUCT ION In this essay, I juxtapose two cases handed down four days apart in October Term : Kelo v. City of New London1 and Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales.2 These cases reflected on the home and what it means to lose the home. They also both excited significant responses associated with broad-based social movements. My argument, for those who like to have such things stated explicitly at the outset, is as follows. I think a key to making sense of the cases’ meanings is the legal traces of the uncanny character of the home. The uncanny is a literary term meant to capture a dreadful, horrifying feeling that occurs when the utterly familiar and comfortable (heimlich) becomes unfa- miliar and frightening (unheimlich) before your very eyes.3 The uncanny is Law &amp; Literature, Vol. , Issue , pp. –. issn 1535-685x, electronic issn 1541-2601. © 2008 by The Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University.

Justice O’Connor deployed the uncanny in her dissenting account of why the taking in Kelo was unconstitutional, classing and gender- ing the problem of economic development takings. The uncanny in Castle Rock was twofold: First there was the (gendered) horror of the facts, in which a mother’s children were taken from the home by their father and murdered despite her desperate pleas to the police to enforce a restraining order prom- ising protection. Then there was the Supreme Court’s inability to accept the full implications of the contemporary reformist domestic violence regime now embraced in established legal circles, that the home should be subject to public control and the criminal law to private control. The Supreme Court was whipsawed between the legally uncanny relation between the home and the criminal law and the factually uncanny terrorizing of the home by the violent patriarch.  If the home is the archetypal site of the uncanny, the judicial opinion presents itself as a genre wholly cabined by norms and rules that resist the uncanny. Judicial opinions about the home thus become vexed in the extreme. On the one hand, the “facts” (as lawyers call them) must be pre- sented, and these reflect astonishing realities that defy ordinary language— in the Supreme Court cases discussed here, the taking and destruction of a family home, and the murder of three children kidnapped by their father from the home and care of their mother. On the other hand, the “law”— which is to say the dense structures of reasoning by text and analogy that are the lifeblood of legal decisions—strives self-consciously to repress dis- order, so that the legal results appear inevitable. The difficulty of this effort is manifest in the genre of the judicial opinion, which simultaneously pre- sents and refutes counterarguments, and often appears alongside a dissent offering alternative interpretations. Interdisciplinary work always presents challenges, but law and literature seems more challenging for lawyers than most. Symposia and anthologies have been published, and legal luminaries have weighed in on methodol- ogy. Yet relatively little work takes the straightforward approach I adopt 292 </page> <page sequence="3">                           LAL2003_01  Page 293  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM  Suk •  Taking the Home here: doctrinally attuned examination of core legal texts—here, Supreme Court opinions—using a primary method of literary analysis, namely close reading.5 On the one hand, this approach should be reminiscent of old-fashioned doctrinal scholarship that engaged in close analysis of the language of cases in the hopes of understanding more about those decisions and about the law. On the other hand, my approach cannot fully boast such traditionalism, as it is informed by literary technique not often used for legal analysis by legal scholars. Literary scholars have had fewer qualms about attending to rhetorical practices in legal materials, but for reasons of disciplinary training, they have usually avoided thorny doctrinal puzzles.6 The uncanny haunts the meanings of two Supreme Court opinions released in the same week, both of which grappled with the concept of home. Lest we forget, that means that nine justices and thirty-five law clerks worked on these cases during precisely the same period of time. To any literary reader it would be odd to think that such juxtaposition would not affect the texts produced and the ideas in them. The opinions represent the collective work of justices aided by law clerks, not to mention the myriad lawyers and judges who wrote the briefs and the decisions in the lower courts. Along with the opinions’ production of meaning, the cases’ public reception is a rich vein to be tapped. And of course an inevitable feature of legal opinions is that they simultaneously take seriously and take for granted the relation between state coercion, life and death, and public meanings produced through texts.  I . UNCANNY  TAK INGS A. Home and Hotel In the summer of , an unusual proposal appeared before the , resi- dents of Weare, New Hampshire. It was a plan to use the rural town’s power of eminent domain to take an eighteenth-century farmhouse, the home of one of its residents, and transform it into an inn to be called the Lost Liberty Hotel.7 The inn would feature a dining room called Just Desserts Café and a museum open to the public.8 The stated purpose of this proposed taking was to bring “economic development and higher tax revenue to Weare.”9  The house was a ramshackle structure on a remote dead-end dirt road.10 Its well-liked owner was David Hackett Souter, the town’s most famous resi- dent. Even at the time of his nomination to the Supreme Court, locals had 293 </page> <page sequence="4">                                                 LAL2003_01  Page 294  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM Law &amp; L i terature •  Volume 20,  Number  3 been proudly protective of his privacy.11 Now his unassuming house, which had once belonged to his grandparents,12 was the focus of a small-town dis- pute that was garnering national attention. The cause was the – judgment in Kelo v. City of New London, in which Justice Souter had joined the majority of the Court in deciding that economic development takings did not violate the “public use” requirement of the Tak- ings Clause.13 The Court held that the Constitution did not prohibit the use of eminent domain to take private property and transfer it to other private ownership as part of a development plan to bring economic benefits to the community. The property owners’ objection that economic development was not a public use met with the Court’s response that that there is “no principled way of distinguishing economic development from the other public purposes that we have recognized.”14 Those other public purposes—relieving urban blight in Washington, D.C., and breaking up oligarchic property ownership in Hawaii—the Court said, were not substantially different from the eco- nomic development contemplated in New London.15 Doctrinally, the case was significant but not pathbreaking.16 Prior cases had already ruled that taking private property and transferring it to other pri- vate ownership could be “public use” if it would serve a public purpose. Kelo did no more than hold that public purpose could also include economic development, even when there was no blight or property oligopoly to remove. The decision was not exactly dictated by prior cases, but neither was it a radical departure.17 But the public understood Kelo differently. Within days of the decision, commentators across the country loudly decried it.18 Outrage abounded, with characterizations such as “terrifying,” “sickening,” and “creepy.”19 The practical thrust of the response tended to be similar: in almost every state and innumerable municipalities, spooked citizens proposed laws that would limit the purposes for which government could take property under the rubric of “public use.”20 These responses were themselves symbolic to a large degree.21 The Lost Liberty Hotel proposal was a quirky variant of this legislatively oriented protest movement. Ultimately, Weare residents voted not to take Justice Souter’s home, and instead urged the New Hampshire state legislature to forbid the kind of takings Kelo held constitutional.22 And it was difficult to imagine the farmhouse becoming a hotel (who goes to Weare?).23 But the incident was an intriguing window into the nature of the public response and the cultural meaning of the case itself.  294 </page> <page sequence="5">                                              LAL2003_01  Page 295  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM  Suk •  Taking the Home According to the California businessman who came up with the scheme, the Lost Liberty Hotel had to be built on Justice Souter’s property “because it is a unique site being the home of someone largely responsible for destroying property rights for all Americans.”24 The proposal targeted a reclusive justice with strong roots in his home.25 Going beyond commentary, it aimed to sub- ject Souter to precisely what Kelo permitted—to suggest that if he had con- templated his own home being taken for economic development, he would have voted differently.26  The proposal sought to punish Justice Souter as a private homeowner for a decision taken in his public role, to assert the inseparability of those identities. The proposal to use Kelo itself to take his home and turn it into a hotel staged a performance of Kelo’s destabilization of the private/public line. A famously private man, known to seek refuge in his home away from public life in Washington D.C., would be publicly deprived of that private refuge—figuratively and literally.27 Proposing the transformation of the Souter home into the Lost Liberty Hotel drew on the uncanny association of hotels as home substitutes, in between private and public space.28 It thereby performed the uncanny idea of home as neither private nor public.  B. Class and Values, House and Home There was little surprising to legal academics in the suggestion that “public use” and “private use” may not be clearly delineated.29 But why did many Americans experience Kelo as a distressing tear in the social fabric needing swift repair? The substantial outrage Kelo occasioned had to do with the meaning of the home in American social life.30 The basic idea of losing the home, the center and repository of family life, touched upon a profound and widespread middle-class anxiety.31  It is extremely rare for a person to have his home taken by eminent domain.32 This is not a common problem. The prevalent taker of homes is not the state but private entities, upon foreclosure by creditors. Home, the sym- bol of the American Dream, is a focal point of great middle-class anxiety, often centered on potential loss to foreclosure.33 Kelo’s facts were uncannily reminiscent of home foreclosure because they involved homes ending up in the hands of other private parties. The social meaning of home loss is the loss of a family’s economic stability, and with that the loss of middle-class status.34 Kelo stirred up a fear of falling central to the middle-class psyche.35 But in a 295 </page> <page sequence="6">                                                    LAL2003_01  Page 296  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM Law &amp; L i terature •  Volume 20,  Number  3 sense, there was more horror because it was the government’s doing, with the Supreme Court’s approval. In referring to the property to be taken from Kelo’s petitioners, Justice Stevens’s majority opinion, holding that the economic development taking was for public use, never used the term “home” at all, but rather “house.” The word “home” was featured in the opinion twice: once in referring to the new homes that were to be built upon the taking of blighted property in Washington, D.C., and once in referring to the homes newly purchased by ordinary people after the taking of oligopolists’ property in Hawaii.36 In Justice O’Connor’s dissenting opinion, by contrast, the Kelo petition- ers were “nine resident or investment owners of  homes.”37 Her opinion used the word “home” eight times throughout, with repeated reference to the fact that the properties to be taken were homes, even though some of the houses were owned as investments.38 She began by closely associating a petitioner with the property to be taken through a series of rhetorical moves bringing to the surface the home concept: Petitioner Wilhelmina Dery . . . lives in a house in Walbach Street that has been in her family for over  years. She was born in the house in ; her husband, petitioner Charles Dery, moved into the house when they married in . Their son lives next door with his family in the house he received as a wedding gift. . . .39 This introductory description of the lawsuit featured the major events that comprise the multigenerational life cycles of a family—birth, mar- riage, rearing children, children’s marriage, and grandchildren. Thus when Justice O’Connor pointed out that “the homes of three plaintiffs . . . are to be demolished,” and described the lawsuit as an effort “[t]o save their homes,” it was as if to suggest that the physical structure housed a family life accreted over generations.40 The meaning of the taking then was the destruction of Family.  Moreover, the takings were presented as marking the passing of a way of life in which people lived in the house where they were born and married, where their parents and grandparents lived. Justice O’Connor’s nostalgic reci- tation located the Dery family in their New England house for over a century, whereas the average person in today’s America changes residences every few years.41 The details she mentioned also marked the family as white people who had been in America since the nineteenth century.42 In this respect, the family she showcased was somewhat unusual, resonating obliquely with the 296 </page> <page sequence="7">                         LAL2003_01  Page 297  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM  Suk •  Taking the Home post-Kelo public attention to Justice Souter, whose ancestors, including several Mayflower passengers, had lived in New England for centuries.43  Justice O’Connor, herself a skilled mythmaker of home and family vir- tue, had recently co-authored with her brother an autobiographical narra- tive about her family’s ranch where she lived from birth through early childhood, and where she later always returned.44 This ranch—the name of which was the book’s title, Lazy B—was in her family since the nineteenth century for over a hundred years.45 Her parents lived there from their mar- riage until their deaths.46 Her focus on the Derys and the facts that she saw fit to mention in Kelo recall her construction of her family’s ranch as the site of autochthonous family life and upbringing rooted in a place, imbued with values, and connected to the past. She writes of how the “power of the memories of life” on the ranch: [s]urges through my mind and my heart often. . . . We know that our characters were shaped by our experiences there. . . . The value system we learned was simple and unsophisticated and the product of necessity. What counted was competence and the ability to do whatever was required to maintain the ranch operation in good working order. . . . Verbal skills were less important than the ability to know and understand how things work in the physical world. Personal qualities of honesty, dependability, competence, and good humor were valued most.47 Note the telling emphasis on the central role of the home in shaping a person; the valorizing of a stripped-down, hardworking, unpretentious way of life; and the paramount virtue of physical work and connection to the land. The mythmaking nostalgia here is about the home’s “simple and unsophisticated” values where children are raised to become grounded, honest, modest Americans of good solid character. She believed that these ingrained values were “due to the life created for us by our parents” on the ranch,48 which she clung to as “a never-changing anchor in a world of uncertainties.”49 This is a powerful vision of what home can mean and do to a person in the world.  O’Connor tells of a “heart-wrenching time for all the family” when eventually there remained “no family member . . . interested in making the ranch his or her home.”50 She suggests that the government’s tightening regulations on cattle ranching affected the viability of keeping the ranch in the family:51  297 </page> <page sequence="8"> LAL2003_01  Page 298  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM Law &amp; L i terature •  Volume 20,  Number  3 We thought it would always be there, that our children and our children’s chil- dren would know it as we did. We knew that no matter how far we had traveled, we were still welcome there. . . . The decision to sell, to let the ranch go, was so difficult that I still avoid confronting it directly. I fear returning to the ranch and seeing it in other hands and with all its changes.52 If she avowedly avoided confronting the unsettling sight of her family’s home in other hands and transformed into something else, she encountered the idea at least indirectly in Kelo, where the petitioners stood to have their homes taken for transformation and use by others.  C. Gendering Takings Poignantly in Kelo, Justice O’Connor ventriloquized the petitioners’ argu- ment that though “the government may take their homes” for, say, railroads, it may not take them for “the private use of other owners simply because the new owners may make more productive use of the property.”53 She specifi- cally pointed to petitioners Susette Kelo and Wilhelmina Dery, remarking that they had “well-maintained homes”—in other words, middle class (not blighted).54 The wrongness of giving these women’s homes to more produc- tive users was evident: “For who among us can say she already makes the most productive or attractive possible use of her property?”55  With this Justice O’Connor added gender to class in critiquing eco- nomic development takings. Her formulation hinted at the phenomenon of keeping up with the Joneses. It sounded like she was channeling an earnest homemaker on the impossibility of reaching a Martha Stewart-type ideal. And not for lack of trying. She just hadn’t “already” gotten there and nei- ther had her neighbor. This evinced a sense of what it means to be middle class—aspiring, hoping to do even better, implicitly in competition with others. The “us” in Justice O’Connor’s rhetorical question was middle- class homemakers, explicitly female maintainers of the private sphere.56 These women’s homes were being deemed not productive or attractive enough compared to other uses that would benefit the public. This case was not just business. It was personal. Justice O’Connor’s dissent took umbrage on behalf of middle-class Amer- ican housewives and their way of life. She managed to imply that taking the home because other uses would be more productive or attractive was to dis- respect the average homemaker who is decently caring for her home and 298 </page> <page sequence="9"> LAL2003_01  Page 299  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM  Suk •  Taking the Home family. If property is associated with male ownership, and the house as a cas- tle is associated with a man, the home is associated with women. Her dissent implied a woman’s perspective on the taking.57 Justice O’Connor accordingly shifted the focus from the idea of property to the idea of home, itself implic- itly gendered—that was what mattered. Susette Kelo and Wilhelmina Dery, middle-class white homemakers maintaining their homes, simply did not make sense as people whose prop- erty would be taken for public purpose. Justice Thomas reminded us in his own dissent: “Urban renewal projects have long been associated with the displacement of blacks; ‘[i]n cities across the country, urban renewal came to be known as “Negro removal.”’”58 Indeed he predicted that the future harm of Kelo, including “the indignity inflicted by uprooting [individuals] from their homes,” would fall on poor and minority communities who are “systematically less likely to put their lands to the highest and best social use. . . .”59 But Justice O’Connor’s approach acknowledged the permissibil- ity of takings where poor persons’ property use was actively harming mid- dle-class social and economic aspirations through the creation of urban blight, or where rich oligopolists were impeding the middle-class dream of owning one ’s own home.60  The trouble for Justice O’Connor was the idea that the state could “replac[e] any Motel  with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.”61 In this parade of displacement, the “simple and unsophisticated” values that she associated with her roots appear62—in the motley tropes of Motel , home, and farm—in direct con- trast to things that too often supersede those values in modern society: cos- mopolitan upscale luxury, suburbanized consumerism, and industrialized estrangement from an agrarian past—sometimes known as economic development. D. Specter of Condemnation The anxiety of middle-class status resonates with home as the symbol of the all-important public-private line that underlies the notion of property. Kelo, according to Justice O’Connor, “wash[ed] out any distinction between private and public use of property.”63 She reasoned that “[t]he trouble with economic development takings is that private benefit and inci- dental public benefit are, by definition, merged and mutually reinforcing.”64 299 </page> <page sequence="10"> LAL2003_01  Page 300  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM Law &amp; L i terature •  Volume 20,  Number  3 If any private-to-private transfer of property that benefited the public could easily be recast as having a public purpose, the private-public line was rendered so manipulable as to be erased.  Justice O’Connor stated it dramatically: “The specter of condemnation hangs over all property.”65 Condemnation in property language has two obvious meanings: The first is the exercise of eminent domain. The second is the pronouncement of a structure as unfit for habitation. The implicit judg- ment that a home, however well maintained, is not productive or attractive enough to be saved partakes of both of these meanings. It was as if the bour- geois institution of the home were being destroyed precisely by being sub- jected to the considerations about economic productivity from which home is imagined to be the refuge.66  The adage that a man’s house is his castle suggests a middle-class person at home on a par with any rich man, even the king.67 Home renders a person a king in important part because the home is a bulwark against even the king’s intrusion.68 It would not be too much to say that it is difficult to imagine the middle-class person’s rights and status without the concept of the home. Jus- tice O’Connor’s home discourse drew out the bond between bourgeois status and private property. The home emerged as the center around which revolved the intimately linked anxieties about middle-class status and the private-public distinction. As a doctrinal matter, of course, Kelo was not about the home in particular, as its holding applied to any private property.69 The problem was not the taking of a home for public use. It was rather that the home, the archetype of prop- erty, was the site of the turning of the public-private distinction on its head. But the public reaction to Kelo transcended actual fear of condemnation, inchoate class interest, or abstract investment in the public-private dis- tinction. It manifested a barely repressed dread in the middle-class thought-world, the dread of home loss. In this light, Kelo was downright unhomely. The “specter of condemnation” was the anxiety of loss of middle- class status that hangs over the home and is embodied in it.  The image of a “specter” here bears another look. A specter is a ghost that haunts. A home that is not a refuge is haunted—haunted by anxiety of its own destruction. Justice O’Connor seemed to figure the Kelo decision itself as a kind of uncanny, ghostly presence haunting the home. The urge to overturn Kelo is the urge to exorcise the home by keeping the private private and the public public. The likely unconscious reference to the 300 </page> <page sequence="11"> LAL2003_01  Page 301  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM  Suk •  Taking the Home beginning of The Communist Manifesto (“A spectre is haunting Europe— the spectre of communism.”) then resonates with the haunting warning of the destruction of private property.70  I I . UNCANNY  PROPERTY A. Horror Story Days after the Kelo decision, another constitutional case in its own way engaged the Court in unsettling property notions surrounding the home. Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales had the most uncanny facts possible: the mur- der of children by their father when the police failed to enforce a domestic abuse restraining order.71 The legal question was whether the government’s failure to enforce the order was a deprivation of . . . yes, property. Jessica Gonzales had obtained a domestic abuse restraining order com- manding her husband not to “molest or disturb the peace of ” his wife and children, and to stay at least  yards from the family home.72 The order directed the police that they “shall use every reasonable means to enforce” the order, and “shall arrest” or seek an arrest warrant if they had probable cause to believe the order had been violated.73 One day, her husband went to the family home and abducted his three daughters from the lawn where they were playing.74 Jessica called the police to request enforcement of the order, but despite five calls over almost five hours and a visit to the police station, the police did not attempt to arrest her hus- band.75 Nearly eight hours after her first call, her husband went to the station, opened fire with a semiautomatic weapon, and was immediately shot dead.76 Their murdered daughters were in the back of his pickup truck.77  These dreadful events from the annals of domestic violence wherein an abusive father became murderous seem to verge on a horror story. In the last thirty years, the iconic cultural image of the father who goes mad and terrorizes the family is Jack Nicholson’s face as Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick’s film The Shining, chopping an ax through the door in pursuit of his wife.78 The home is the Overlook Hotel, where Jack is a new care- taker, and he and his wife and son are isolated there during the winter off-season. He has been told that a previous caretaker of this hotel had gone crazy of cabin fever and brutally killed his wife, his two young daughters, and himself.  301 </page> <page sequence="12"> LAL2003_01  Page 302  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM Law &amp; L i terature •  Volume 20,  Number  3 That Jack is a caretaker of the hotel rather than a proper patriarch in his own home allegorizes the failures and disappointments of modern familial masculinity. The classic genre of the haunted house lends to frightening reflection here on anxieties of the American middle-class family.79 The haunt- ing of the hotel—uncannily both home and not home80—converges in the film with our culture’s exemplary domestic horror: the destruction of the family by the violence of the patriarch.81 The figure meant to provide for the home’s safety turns out to be the most terrifying threat to it. B. A Private Right to the Police? As I have argued elsewhere, an important feature of the criminal law of domestic violence (“DV”) today is the criminal law’s treatment of an abuser’s presence in the home as a proxy for DV, through the issuance and enforcement of restraining orders.82 A crucial piece of the contemporary DV enforcement regime is mandatory arrest for restraining order viola- tions, which produces an expectation of police supervision, to ensure that the violent husband stays away from the home. The claim that the Supreme Court addressed in Castle Rock unfolded this expectation to its logical conclusion. The case arose when Jessica Gonzales sued the town of Castle Rock for damages, on the theory that the failure to enforce her restraining order violated federal constitutional due process.83 Ultimately, the Supreme Court had to resolve whether a recipient of a DV restraining order has a constitutionally protected property right to its enforcement by the police. To understand how the DV regime we have today plausibly raises such a question, it is necessary first to recall that the DV restraining order reallo- cates property in the home.84 The restraining order typically bans its subject’s presence in the family home. The exclusion of a husband means the corre- sponding conferral on a wife of the exclusive right of possession.85 The restrain- ing order thus functions as conferral of a property interest that is enforced by criminal law.86  DV mandatory arrest laws that require the police to arrest upon probable cause for restraining order violations aim for mandatory criminal enforce- ment of this property reallocation. The purpose is to have the police maintain the abuser’s exclusion, and leave the police without discretion to treat the abuser’s presence other than as a crime. The goal is to overcome the distinctive 302 </page> <page sequence="13"> LAL2003_01  Page 303  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM  Suk •  Taking the Home problems associated with DV enforcement, including the traditional reluc- tance of the police to intervene in family quarrels and a DV victim’s typical doubts about whether she wants her husband treated as a criminal.87 To that end, it becomes necessary for the police to enforce the taking of the home from the violent man and the exclusive conferral on the abused woman of the right to possess the home—the state ’s solution to the domestic horror.  The context for Castle Rock is thus a DV regime that reallocates rights to possess the home and makes criminal enforcement of that property realloca- tion mandatory. The Tenth Circuit sitting en banc held that a recipient of a DV restraining order had a protected property interest in its enforcement by the police, and that failure to enforce it was deprivation of property without due process.88 Thus Jessica Gonzales could win her suit for damages against the town if the facts were established.  The Tenth Circuit framed the issue within the doctrinal lens of procedural due process,89 relying on the line of cases in which the Supreme Court had recognized that certain state-created property entitlements may not be taken away without due process.90 The particular entitlement at stake in this case was police enforcement, which the Tenth Circuit thought comparable to other government services that the Supreme Court had previously deemed protected property interests, such as a free education, continued utility ser- vice, and welfare or disability benefits.91 The restraining order, the Tenth Circuit reasoned, commanded enforcement, using mandatory language that limited police discretion, as did the state mandatory arrest statutes.92  “Recogniz[ing] domestic abuse as an exceedingly important social ill,”93 the Tenth Circuit noted, the legislature had aimed “to alter the fact that the police were not enforcing domestic abuse restraining orders.”94 Changing this law enforcement norm was a means to “attack the domestic violence problems” proper, with the goal of holding the “perpetrator . . . accountable for his actions,” and making the “victim . . . feel safe.”95 The court concluded that the restraining order and the mandatory arrest statutes together created a protected property interest in police enforcement that the state could not deny without due process.96  The initially surprising idea that a DV restraining order confers a prop- erty right to police enforcement is not so surprising when viewed in light of the expectation of police supervision of the home that the DV regime creates.

If the party from whom the state has taken the property interest does not abide by the reallocation, man- datory arrest laws require the police to arrest him. It then becomes a very plausible further step to see the recipient of the order as having not only a right to exclusive possession of the home, but also a right to police enforcement of that reallocation of property. After all, without enforcement, what good is the order?97 It is as if the idea of property were contagious, moving from a right in the home to a right in police enforcement of a right in the home. Thus witness a slide from an expectation that the police will enforce state-conferred property rights in the home to a conception of criminal law enforcement in the home as a property right. What emerges out of the expectation of police supervision in the home is the ultimate solution to the horror of domestic violence. The DV restraining order becomes a kind of super-property: property given to the victim by the state with the mandatory promise to protect and arrest. That is the answer to the anxiety of the violent destruction of the home. One can then construe the failure of enforcement as a deprivation of property that the state had previ- ously conferred: the safe home promised. C. Reaction All this may sound reassuring as a legal denouement to a domestic horror story. But the Supreme Court reedited the film to produce a different result. Justice Scalia, writing for a Court of seven justices over the dissent of Justice Stevens (joined by Justice Ginsburg), reversed the Tenth Circuit and held that a restraining order does not confer a property right to police enforce- ment. Even in rejecting such a right as a matter of federal constitutional due process, the Court struggled with the well-accepted logic of the DV manda- tory arrest regime that had led to the lower court’s conclusion that a restrain- ing order creates a property right to police enforcement.  The Court acknowledged that DV mandatory arrest statutes were often considered more mandatory than traditional mandatory arrest statutes, but emphasized that even so, the police still retained discretion in particular instances.98 Language providing that the police “shall use every means to enforce a restraining order” was not strong enough to make police enforce- ment actually mandatory, and therefore could not create a constitutional entitlement to enforcement.99 304 </page> <page sequence="15"> LAL2003_01  Page 305  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM  Suk •  Taking the Home Women’s advocates condemned Castle Rock as an appalling repudiation of DV reform efforts over the last thirty years, not to mention a dangerous rul- ing for battered women.100 DV mandatory arrest laws were supposed to take away police discretion not to arrest. Justice Stevens’s dissent recounted that “[s]tates passed a wave of these statutes in the ’s and ’s with the unmistakable goal of eliminating police discretion in this area.”101 The Court seemed to be rejecting this widespread understanding of a major DV reform goal.102 A conference held in the wake of Castle Rock was called “Some are Guilty—All are Accountable: Accountability in the Age of Denial.” The advert called the Court’s decision “shocking for its message to survivors, advocates, scholars and state actors that ‘shall’ really didn’t mean shall at all. . . . [T]he majority marginalized the legislative history of thirty-two juris- dictions that enacted mandatory legislation and rendered invisible the pain of battered women and that of a movement.”103 The academic commentary on Castle Rock has been similarly critical.104 But a contrary ruling in Castle Rock might predictably have led to a tightening of issuance of DV restraining orders, as governments came to terms with the restraining order’s creation of an entitlement that left them open to suits for damages, contingent in each instance on unpredictable acts of violent individuals. Abuse victims might well have faced a higher bar to obtaining orders than they currently do, and hence increased danger. Thus the wish to have DV mandatory arrest laws declared truly mandatory had a symbolic dimension for the DV movement that was not only about protecting DV victims from harm. The Supreme Court in Castle Rock gestured toward the possibility that truly mandatory language, if adopted, might well create an entitlement to police enforcement.105 It was true that the denial of federal constitutional lia- bility did not block states from creating and imposing liability in their own spheres.106 The decision did spawn public calls for state legislative action.107  But in dicta, the Court indicated that even if state legislatures strength- ened the mandatory language, it still might not be prepared to find federal constitutional liability. That is, even if the police were clearly divested of any discretion, that still might not mean that an individual had an entitlement to have the police perform an arrest.108 The reason? “The serving of public rather than private ends is the normal course of the criminal law. . . .”109 Presenting a conception of criminal law as having public purpose, the Court stated that private harm must be subordinated to the public purpose of criminal law.110 The notion of a private right to criminal enforcement was anathema.  305 </page> <page sequence="16"> LAL2003_01  Page 306  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM Law &amp; L i terature •  Volume 20,  Number  3 But feminists had long struggled to impress upon the public that the interest in combating violence in the “private” sphere of the home was just as “public” as the states’ enforcement of criminal law in public space.111 The goal had been to locate DV fully in the ambit of criminal law and to have DV treated as a public matter. As DV has increasingly attained that sought- after public status, there remains little of the past doubt about whether DV is a crime. Legislatures, prosecutors, judges, and the public now do see DV as a public harm that should appropriately be addressed, often on a manda- tory basis, by the criminal law.112  This acceptance enabled the en banc Tenth Circuit and two dissenting Justices of the Supreme Court to see police enforcement of DV restraining orders as nondiscretionary and thus something a private individual could claim was a state-created entitlement. Much of Justice Stevens’s dissent agreeing with the Tenth Circuit faithfully recited the DV movement’s tenets with respect to mandatory arrest laws’ goal to break down the perceived public-private wall that long justified police non-enforcement of DV.113 The historic rise of the public-purpose conception of DV enforcement must be juxtaposed with the Supreme Court’s resistance to the notion of a private entitlement to police enforcement. If a DV restraining order viola- tion is to be enforced by the police with arrest, then that is a public rather than a private matter. To accept the public purpose of DV enforcement was to think of DV as part of criminal law enforcement. A private suit for dam- ages based on the failure to enforce criminal law seemed, to Justice Scalia, obviously inconsistent with the idea that criminal law vindicates the public interest.  Indeed, the Court suggested further that even if state law did create a pri- vate entitlement to police enforcement, that entitlement still might not consti- tute “property” for purposes of federal constitutional due process.114 The logic of this dictum was that a private party’s interest would be arising “inci- dentally” out of the traditional government function of arresting criminals.115 In other words, while criminal law (of trespass, burglary, and robbery, for example) ordinarily does enforce private property rights, it had never con- ferred on crime victims what I have above called a super-property right—a property right to enforcement of the criminal law.116 The Court’s resistance to super-property was based on the selfsame premise to which DV advocates were committed: that DV is crime, and that criminal law serves public rather than private interests. Jessica Gonzales’s claim thus ran headlong into the 306 </page> <page sequence="17"> LAL2003_01  Page 307  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM  Suk •  Taking the Home legal uncanniness of conceiving a private right to something as quintessen- tially public as police enforcement of criminal law. D. Haunted Houses The claim that nonenforcement of the order was a deprivation specifically of property drew upon a meaning that the DV restraining order entails in the legal system today: the state is supposed to ensure a DV victim her home—its safety, security, comfort, and protection. In this story, the state gave her exclusive possession of the family home by way of the restraining order. The state then had to ensure that she possessed the home and that her husband stayed away so the family would be secure. And finally, the state took the home from her by failing to provide the promised protection. Taking away that promised protection was in effect taking away the home. Thus it was like deprivation of property. Couching police enforcement of a DV restraining order as a property right, as the Tenth Circuit en banc did, was a logical extension of the view that a DV victim’s security in her home necessitates not only police enforce- ment, as with other criminal law, but mandatory enforcement. The notion that she had a super-property right reflected the way in which the home, the archetype of private property, was increasingly reconceived as a space in which public supervision was expected. The battered woman’s home space could be understood to be conferred, maintained, and supervised by the public. The domestic horror was without question a public matter. Thus when the violent patriarch went crazy and murdered the children, the state ’s failure to prevent it was the wrong. Because the state had issued a restraining order against him, the state was effectively deemed responsible for the harm that a violent person could possibly inflict. The DV movement has had much success in convincing legal actors of the public nature of private violence. Thus we might wonder why the seven Jus- tices of the Castle Rock majority did not take the legally plausible approach adopted below by the Tenth Circuit en banc and two dissenting Supreme Court Justices. An answer is suggested by considering how thoroughly the logic of the restraining order in a DV mandatory enforcement regime envi- sions the home as appropriately subject to state supervision and control in service of the public interest: a home is made public, but with the purpose of protecting a private woman. In this regime, the home could be taken (from the 307 </page> <page sequence="18"> LAL2003_01  Page 308  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM Law &amp; L i terature •  Volume 20,  Number  3 husband) and given (to the wife) in the public interest. But ironically, public failure to enforce that allocation gave rise to a claim for damages that revealed the purpose of public supervision and control as essentially a private one. Kelo’s four dissenting Justices (O’Connor, Rehnquist, Scalia, and Tho- mas) were avowed maintainers of the conceptual public-private line upon which the system of private property was thought to rest. For them, private property could be taken for public use; but public purpose and private pur- pose had to be meaningfully distinct from each other. These four Justices, along with more liberal Justices Kennedy, Souter, and Breyer, formed the majority in Castle Rock, decided days later. Perhaps similarly, the criminal law’s treatment of the home—that symbolic bastion of private property—as within public supervision and control, for the purpose of an entitled private person, was uncanny. Private property taken for public purpose was comfort- able enough. But the home as public property taken and maintained for pri- vate purpose? That was uncanny. The uncanny specter that haunted the home in Kelo was home loss, and in Castle Rock it was home violence. The home is simultaneously the source of security against those anxieties and the focal point of those anxi- eties. The state is at once the solution and the problem. The imaginative stakes here lie in the relation between the home and the police. Would the expectation of the state ’s full control of the home become an accepted legal commonplace? The resistance of the Castle Rock majority to a property right to police enforcement partook of anxiety also evinced in the Kelo dissent— that through fancy manipulation of concepts of public and private, the home became so thoroughly subject to the public interest that perhaps it would be as public as, or more public than, the public streets. The home was haunted by the specter of becoming at once the exemplary private and the exemplary public space in the contemporary legal imagination—a specter that was raised by the legal response to uncanny facts of home destruction through condemnation and violence.  CONCLUS ION :  UNCANNY  CH I ASMUS   Out of the juxtaposition of Kelo and Castle Rock emerges a paired chiasmus.117 Kelo was supposed to be about the taking of private property for a public pur- pose. Justice O’Connor’s dissent suggested not merely the much-vaunted eli- sion of private and public, but outright reversal, wherein the home effectively 308 </page> <page sequence="19"> LAL2003_01  Page 309  Monday, October 20, 2008  10:14 AM  Suk •  Taking the Home became “public” property, used for “private” purpose. She translated the meaning of this conceptual crossing into a gendered middle-class anxiety that haunts the American home. In Castle Rock, the Tenth Circuit en banc deci- sion had in effect recognized the violent home as “public” in the sense of being under government supervision, and nevertheless viewed the police as having an essentially “private” purpose to protect it. But all the same, this crossing from private home/public criminal law to public home/private criminal law was uncanny, even as a legal response to the horror of the destructively violent father who terrorizes the home. The Supreme Court found it necessary to reverse it.  In both cases the home was haunted by the crisscrossing of private and public—the specter of condemnation, the fear of falling, the violent patri- arch. The uncanny was the byproduct. If the word unheimlich, or unhomely, suggests the home as archetypal site of the uncanny, these cases together reveal the legal uncanny that home can uniquely produce.118 Law makes and unmakes the home. And the law of the home is uncanny law. * I thank David Barron, Noah Feldman, Janet Halley, Dan Meltzer, Frank Michelman, Martha Minow, Joe Singer, Bill Stuntz, and an anonymous referee for comments on earlier drafts; Andrew Childers, Jonathan Cooper, Ilan Graff, Brett Hartman, Julianne Johnston, Samantha Lipton, Amy Mendenhall, and Jessica Tucker-Mohl for research assistance; and Janet Katz and the staff of the Harvard Law School Library for research support. .  U.S.  (). .  U.S.  (). .

We need only recall the terrible memory of finding a stain on the hotel bed’s sheets. . . .”). That the protagonist is the caretaker of the hotel who is trapped there in the winter puts into relief the unavailability of escape from the troubling aspects of home. Recall also that the Weare proposal to take Justice Souter’s home envisioned turning it into not just any business establishment, but a hotel, deploying the uncanny theme of home that is not home.
