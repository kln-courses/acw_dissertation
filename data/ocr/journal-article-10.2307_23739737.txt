<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOD'S CROOKED LINES: WILLIAM EVERSON AND C. G. JUNG Lee Bartlett all postmodern poets writing in English probably have been influenced by the general notions of analytical psychology at least to some extent. Reading poem after poem by those writers we associate with a certain primitivism especially (Ted Hughes, Theodore Roethke, Sylvia Plath, Gal way Kinnell, the list goes on and on) we feel immediately at least the unconscious pres ence of Jung. Further, some of our most influential recent poets have read rather thoroughly in Jung and have been more di rectly influenced by his thought. Spring 1979: An Annual of Archetypal Psychology and Jungian Thought carried two ar ticles which begin an archeology of Charles Olson's deep inter est in analytical psychology; likewise, Robert Bly's immersion in Jung's work has taken him into an examination of both the Great Mother and Father archetypes, while Clayton Eshleman's has led him into the caves of the "paleolithic imagination" and to Sulfur.1 Of all postmodern poets of consequence, however, William Everson has probably come closest to being a Jungian disciple, and this vision, this discipline, permeates his work. Here I would like to trace the origins of Everson's interest in analytical psychology, then examine two of the poet's core no tions: his view of the poet's vocation as sourced in the pro phetic / shamanistic tradition and his stress on the necessity of a recognition of the anima / animus as a prelude to androgyny, a way to God. I In 1932 Jung had written that "among my patients in the sec ond half of life — that is to say, over thirty-five — there has not been one whose problem in the last resort was not that of find ing a religious outlook on life."2 In 1948 Everson was a year beyond Jung's climacteric. He had undergone a series of traumas, 288</page><page sequence="2">EVERSON AND JUNG including the deaths of both his mother (to whom he was very close) and his father (from whom he was more or less estranged), internment during the war in a camp for conscientious objec tors, estrangement and divorce from his first wife Edwa Poul son, and finally a love affair then second marriage with the poet Mary Fabilli which was on unstable ground to say the least. In the fall, Fabilli (who at this time was re-discovering her lost Catholic faith) gave Everson a copy of St. Augustine's Confes sions, wherein he discovered something he "most desperately needed — a man's religion" to replace his rather vaguely de fined and failing pantheism. On Christmas Eve, Fabilli took Everson to Midnight Mass in a San Francisco cathedral where "the nuns had prepared the Crib to one side of the sanctuary, with fir trees banked about a minature stable." There, suddenly, as he crouched out there on the sheepflats of man's terrestial ambiguity, with nothing but the rags of pitiful pride between me and that death something was spoken into my soul, and hearing I followed. When the fir-smell reached me across the closed interior air of the Cathe dral, binding as it did the best of my past and the best of my future, shaping for the first time that synthesis of spirit and sense I had needed and never found, I was drawn across, and in the smell of the fir saw it for the first time, not merely as an existent thing, but as a created thing, witness of the Word, the divine Logos, who made all earth, and me, a soul in His own image, out of very love. And I saw in the fact of Creation the end of Creation; and in the end of Crea tion saw indeed the unspeakable Lover who draws the loved one out of the web of affliction, remakes him as His own. It was then that I could rise from the pew, and, following like a hound the trace on the air, go where the little images lay, in the Crib there, so tiny, among the simple beasts, watched over by the cleanly woman and the decent man, and these humble ones, my good friends the sheepherd ers, who in that instant outleaped the philosophers. That was the night I entered into the family and fellowship of Christ — made my assent, such as it was — one more poor wretch, who had nothing to bring but his iniquities.3 Following this experience, Everson took instruction in the Catholic faith, converted, worked for a time with the Catholic Workers Movement in Oakland, California, then eventually entered the Dominican Order as Brother Antoninus. Until this time, he had a rising reputation as a poet of the California 289</page><page sequence="3">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Central Valley; after a few years of monastic silence, Everson emerged again on the literary scene replacing in books like The Crooked Lines of God, The Hazards of Holiness, and The Rose of Solitude his early concerns with man's relationship to the land with man's relationship to God. As Antoninus, Everson became the leading exponent of erotic mysticism in the Church, and with Thomas Merton he enjoyed a reputation as one of the two finest Catholic poets since Gerard Manley Hopkins. This reputation went into slight eclipse when Everson left the Order to marry in 1969, but the 1978 publication of his collected Cath olic poetry, The Veritable Years, reawakened critical interest in his achievement. And it is this work from Everson's Catho lic period which is most thoroughly grounded in analytical psychology. Everson came to Jung through Father Victor White. White, like the poet a Dominican, was Reader in Theology at Black friars College at Oxford. Additionally, he was a foundation mem ber and lecturer at the Jung Institute of Analytical Psychology, and he knew Jung as both a teacher and a friend. White visited Jung at Bollengen numerous times, and carried on a substan tial correspondence with him which led, unfortunately, to an alienation between the two men late in Jung's life. For many years White had planned to write an extended historical, psy choanalytical, and theological treatise on the relationship be tween God and the unconscious, but his work was, he felt, preempted by Albert Beguin's L'Art romantique et la reve, A. Wilwol's Ratsei der Seele, and Josef Goldbrunner's Hellig keit und Gesundheit, among other books. However, the first two chapters of this unfinished project, along with ten other related papers, were collected in 1952 in White's God and the Unconscious. Everson did not read that book until a few years after its publication, and even then, as he explains in his introduction to the volume's recent reissue, he was "suspicious of depth psy cology's pertinence to the spiritual life, prefering to suffer it out with St. John of the Cross." Everson met White in the fall of 1955, when the priest was a visiting lecturer at St. Albert's College in Oakland, where Everson lived as a lay brother. There the two men had discussions centering on "the doctrine of the 290</page><page sequence="4">EVERSON AND JUNG non-essentiality of evil as seen in the abiding tradition of the Church since Augustine, which Jung opposed." Eventually, however, as Everson outlined to me in a letter, White's work on Jung took hold of the poet. White went back to England after the Spring Semester in 1956. He had been sent Marcuse's Eros and Civilization to review, but had no room for it in his bag and left it with me. I began to browse in it, then settled down with the analysis of Freudian psychology which is featured there. I had been introduced to Freud back in 1946 at Cascade Lock, Oregon, awaiting demobilization, via The Function of the Orgasm by Wilhelm Reich, but put it out of my mind since my conversion. I had just gone through a series of depressions, and one of the bretheren suggested I seek psychiatric help. Then I got a letter from a professor writing a book; he asked to reprint "The Raid" and, moreover, com ment on my intentions. I made to reply that it was simply "they who live by the sword will die by the sword," but suddenly I caught my self saying "wait a minute." The Freudian analysis was clicking in my mind. I saw the Oedipus complex in the poem for the first time. It was shockingly revelatory. That night a crucial dream came and next day I began to write an erotic fantasy of the union with the mother. In Jungian terms the anima invaded. But still I did not read Jung, only Freudian books .... Then arrived Neuman's The Origins and History of Consciousness, which won me over and took me back to God and the Unconscious. I put aside Freud and plunged into Jung. It was now 1957. For Everson, this return to White's study, which was to have a central influence on the development of his thought, coin cided with an interest in the religious aspect of the emergence of the Beat Generation writers, a surfacing which the poet came to argue was in fact the reemergence in the 20th Century of the Dionysian spirit.4 II Because Freud's "system" is at its center atheist, it is not finally really available to Catholics; there have been, of course, at tempts to bring the two programs into registration but, as Ev erson points out, these have ended in "the uneasy modus vi vendi between Catholic psychiatry and Freudian psychoanal ysis, based on a moot distinction between soul and psyche, wherein the mentally distressed religionist placed his immortal 291</page><page sequence="5">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW soul in the hands of his shrink."5 In a paper which must have been extremely important to Everson once he began to see his newfound religious faith balanced with the perspectives of analytical psychology, "Freud, Jung and God," White argues that while Jung's split with Freud had various causes, one of the most significant was the disagreement over the nature of God and religion. "Freud's presentation of psychoanalysis," White maintains, "assumes atheism, it does not even claim to prove it." From the relatively early Totem and Taboo to the late The Future of an Illusion, Freud developed one of his central concepts — that God is simply a "phantasy substitute for the actual, and never wholly satisfactory, parent: a projec tion to compensate for an infantile sense of helplessness." In his later work, however, Jung argued that the inverse was true, that once we come to see Freud's notion of the sexual libido as simply a particular instance of a much more pervasive uni versal Spirit, the way becomes open "to us, for instance, no longer to conceive of God as a substitute for the physical father, but rather the physical father as the infant's first substitute for God, the genetically prior bearer of the image of the All-Father. God less a Big Father than the physical father a little God."6 In short, where for Freud then religion was merely a symptom of psychosis, for Jung the absence of religion became the psy chological disease. A second of White's papers which certainly must have ap pealed to Everson was "Revelation and the Unconscious." Here White outlines the idea of prophecy and the prophet in the work of St. Thomas from an implicitly Jungian perspective. St. Thomas believed, White reminds us, in the necessity of divine revelation "because the purpose and meaning of human exist ence is ultimately to be found only in the invisible and incom prehensible Divinity"; the nature of this purpose must, how ever, somehow be made manifest to us, and this is the function of prophecy. Further, White argues, St. Thomas (following St. Paul) regarded revelation as the most important of all charis mata, one which "is no permanent disposition (habitus) to be used at will, but something momentarily undergone (passio); something, not that the recipient does, but that is done to him, which seizes him and overpowers him."7 292</page><page sequence="6">EVERSON AND JUNG The idea of revelation predates Christianity, of course, and Everson's sense of the prophetic voice as it relates to the function of the shaman has been abiding, informing his best essays and interviews as well as his own poetic practice since at least his conversion. "The poet knows that he speaks adequately then only when he speaks somewhat wildly," says Emerson in "The Poet," and it is the ecstasy produced through controlled pos session which Everson feels the shaman, like the poet, channels into artistic activity. Taking the pictographs on the cave walls of Lascaux and Almira as evidence, Andreas Lommel (whom the poet has often used as a source) judges paleolithic shamans to be the first artistically creative figures known to us.8 Indeed, while they often functioned as physicians or high priests or priestesses, they were not simply witch doctors. Tribal witch doctors gained their status through a will to power, and were successful according to their abilities for the power of sugges tion and hypnosis. Shamans, on the other hand, acted not out of a will to power but to escape from possession (or, in clinical terms, psychosis) by entering into shamanistic activity — draw ing, dance, song. Thus, while in some primitive cultures sha mans and witch doctors filled many of the same roles, shamans were primarily distinguished by their call to be artistically creative. Many primitive peoples believed that through art they could influence the forces of nature. Each animal in the natural or der, for example, had a "soul-force," and early hunters be lieved that through a painting of an animal the soul-force could be captured. Among the Tingus tribes, the word Shingken designated the "Lord of the Animals," a god running through all nature. It was on Shingken that the collective relied for its well-being. The shaman was entrusted with the task of inter ceding with Shingken to provide success in the hunt. In an ec static trance the shaman allowed the Lord of the Animals to enter into him, and then on his instructions an anthropomorphic idol was built under which the hunters crawled with their wea pons. It was thus Shingken was captured and the success of the hunt was assured. As in the prophetic tradition, however, one did not become a shaman because he or she wished it, but because some mystic 293</page><page sequence="7">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW force compelled, and in this sense shamanism must be regarded as a vocation. In the Eskimo tradition, this outside force was called "sila," which translates literally in three ways: universe, weather, and understanding. In its religious sense, however, sila was seen as a cosmic power which invaded the shaman and in turn gave power over certain natural forces. The source of this invasion was personified as "Sila Inua, The Lord of Power," and once the shaman had been called he or she would from that point on act as an intercessor between Sila Inua and the tribe. In his classic study on shamanism (another Jungian influ enced, crucial book for Everson), Mircea Eliade concludes that "the Dionysiac mystical current appears to have an entirely dif ferent structure" than the shamanistic mystical impulse.9 From the point of view of the development of internal symbolism he may be correct, but in terms of defining the archetype he is, I think, mistaken. As Lommel points out, the word 'shaman" itself, which has its roots in the Tungus language, designates an excited state. Like the frenzied maenads, the shaman dur ing possession rages, undergoing bodily contortions: The power of shamanhood comes upon the individual like a sickness falling upon him. The individual who is destined to become a shaman feels a lassitude in his limbs that proclaims itself through violent trem bling. Violent, unnatural yawning comes over him; an enormous pres sure rests on his chest; he feels a sudden urge to utter violent and inarticulate cries; he is shaken by a shivering fit; he rolls his eyes, suddenly jumps up and runs around in a circle as though possessed, until he falls, bathed in sweat, and twists about on the ground in epileptic twitching and spasms. In "The Poet as Prophet," a 1976 interview conducted by Albert Gelpi for the Lilly Foundation at Stanford University, Everson spoke at length about this subject. There he explains that the primary function of the poet as prophet is not merely to predict, but to "confront ... to bring an awareness of trans cendent value which is always the guage by which the temporal is measured." He draws a distinction between the prophet tra dition and the shamanistic, arguing that the shaman is more likely to serve as "a living link to his reality than precipitating a confrontation with it." Still, for Everson both the prophet 294</page><page sequence="8">EVERSON AND JUNG and the shaman (and, by extension, the poet) partake of the same archetype (St. Thomas' passio) and the shaman "is pro phetic in the sense that he serves witness to another state of reality." Further, the whole function of the poet as shaman is to maintain the aesthetic, not in the Modernist view, the hypothesized aesthetic object, but to maintain relevance to the archetypal world, the transcendental world, which is non-political, and sacral. It's the identity between the aes thetic and the transcendental world that is the key to the poet's pro phetic function today.10 Everson began to solidify this view of the poet after entering the Order. In his reading he "differed with Jacques Maritan and Thomas Merton who spoke of art and contemplation. In stead [he] placed art as an overflow-down rather than ascent to contemplation-up." Later, however, through White "Jung pro vided the archetype that gave it psychological substance" in his discussions in Psychological Types of the visionary, the Dio nysian artist.11 Ill Of all Jung's concepts, though, it is the idea of the anima/ animus which has taken a central place in Everson's program; that each man carries "a spontaneous product of the uncon scious" which is the feminine within him, while each woman's "unconscious has, so to speak, a masculine imprint."12 These contra-sexual aspects, Jung argues, must be recognized and reconciled within each individual and finally, by extension, within the collective to form an androgynous whole if psychic stability is to be realized. For the eighteen and a half years Everson lived as a Dominican monk, as Antoninus, almost all his work derived its substance and power from the very real tension produced by an ongoing struggle between the spirit and the flesh. The Rose of Solitude (1967) is probably Ever son's finest achievement as Antoninus, and in the prose fore word to that book the poet recognizes this theme: "The spiritual life is both speculative and practical, but a painful tension ob tains between the world of the ideal and the world of imme diate experience." The subject of Rose is a monk's interior 295</page><page sequence="9">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW struggle with sexuality in his relationship with a divorced Mexi can dancer. Yet even deeper, the poem sequence traces the trans formation of a sexual struggle through a Jungian mergence of the masculine and feminine aspects of the Self as a path to gnosis. In sacred literature such a theme abounds, forming, for ex ample, the central conflicts in Augustine's Confessions and St. John of the Cross' Dark Night of the Soul. In our own litera ture, this conflict / transformation receives an early treatment in Whitman's "Children of Adam" and "Calamus." In a note, Whitman describes the idea underlying his "sex poems": "Theory of a Cluster of poems the same to the passions of Woman-love as the 'Calamus Leaves' are to adhesiveness, manly love."13 "Children of Adam" and "Calamus" are, in fact, cele brations of two types of human love — the passional love of man for woman and the "adhesive" love of man for man — and thus may be read as companion poems. Yet these sections offer even more than the development of the theme of cele bration of the body and natural process introduced in "Song of Myself"; here the Orphic bard is transformed into the Cos mic Man, the archetypal New Adam, and we have held out to us the possibility for regeneration through the realization of our sexual nature. "Children of Adam" opens with the identification of Amer ica as the new Eden and the poet as the new Adam, a figure who has emerged "after slumber" to "the garden the World anew ascending." The figure of Adam is apropos here for ac cording to Jung "as the first man Adam is the homo maximus, the Anthropos, the macrocosm. He is not only the prima ma teria, but a universal soul which is also the soul of all men."14 Where in the opening of "Song of Myself" Whitman celebrates the Self in a variety of aspects, here he focuses on "the body Electric" — "mouth, tongue, lips, teeth" — "for these are the soul." His vision is Dionysian: "Today I go consort with Na ture's darlings ... I share the midnight orgies of young men, I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers." "Give me the drink of my passions," Adam cries, and it is through his immersion into the world of the flesh, the world of ecstasy and spontaneity, that he returns to the peace of the primeval 296</page><page sequence="10">EVERSON AND JUNG Garden. As Adam and Eve are paired in ecstasy so too, as Ever son writes in his afterword to River-Root, do all men approach through sexuality regeneration and wholeness. Yet, as Albert Gelpi has commented, "the Cosmic Man is not merely a masculine projection; he is often not only sexual but bisexual or hermaphroditic, as many images of the Self are."15 "Children of Adam" offers us a path for regeneration through the mergence of the anima with the animus, but the psyche cannot be realized fully until the Ademic-figure moves within, that is until he recognizes his own androgynous nature. This recognition occurs for Whitman in "Calamus." Historically Whitman has been chided (and more recently praised) for the homosexual overtones of "Calamus," and there is no doubt they do exist. Here the note of holiness of the body and the natural world is again struck, yet the poet's thrust seems to be away from the passional love for women to the "sturdier" and less transitory love of "manly attachment" he sees inherent in the new Eden. "I believe the main purport of these States is to found a superb friendship," says the poet, "because I perceive it waits, and has always been waiting, latent in all men." "Calamus" is more than a celebration of "adhesive" love be tween men, however, as it is in these poems that the poet allows the surfacing of the feminine aspects of his nature and thus at tains the fully realized psyche of the Cosmic Man. At almost the very center of the section, Whitman writes, "Here the Frail est leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting, / Here I shade and hide my thoughts, I myself do not expose them, / And yet they expose me more than all my other poems." On one level we read this passage as the poet's confession of the dark secret of his homosexuality, yet on another Whitman is throwing over the constraints of the Apollonian for the well of the Dionysian. "Calamus" emerges not as the poet's repudiation of women, but as a recognition of the feminine within himself. Within the Cosmic Man reside both aspects of the psyche — the male and the female, the animus and the anima — and it is through sex ual communion with Eve that Adam moves toward making himself whole, a process which is completed with the recog nition of his androgynous nature in "Calamus." Everson's concern with "the woman within" appears as early 297</page><page sequence="11">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW as the pre-Dominican, pre-Jungian In the Fictive Wish, though it becomes progressively more central to his poetic project through the Catholic poetry leading up to The Rose of Soli tude. As Albert Gelpi points out, "in 'The Encounter' and sev eral other remarkable poems towards the end of Crooked Lines Antoninus becomes the woman before God, his/her whole be ing called into activity by His totally mastering love."16 Fur ther, in "Annul in Me My Manhood" the poet reverses Lady Macbeth's apostrophe "unsex me here," asking that God might make him "woman-sexed and weak, / If by that total transfor mation/I might.know Thee more," while the later "God Germed in Raw Granite" asks "Is this she? Woman within! / . . . when we /Well-wedded merge, by Him /Twained into one and solved there." But it is not until Rose that Everson moves beyond a sense of the recognition of the anima as a facet of his quest to, like Whitman, a realization that in fact the woman within is its object. The "Prologue" to Rose announces that volume's theme, one that parallels Whitman's while significantly altering its situa tion in that here the struggle is overtly male-female: The dark roots of the rose cry in my heart. They pierce through rock-ribs of my stony flesh, Invest the element, the loam of life. They twist and mesh. The red blood of the rose beats on, beats on, Of passion poured, of fiery love composed, Virtue redeemed, the singular crest of life, And pride deposed. Love cries regenerate and lust moans consumed, Shaken in terror on that rage of breath. Untrammeled still the red rose burns on And knows no death. Petal by crimson petal, leaf by leaf, Unfolds the luminous core, the bright abyss, Proffers at last the exquisite delight Of the long kiss. Until shall pass away the wasted means Leaving in essence what time held congealed: The Sign of God evoked from the splendid flesh Of the Rose revealed. 298</page><page sequence="12">EVERSON AND JUNG The opening lines of the poem present a traditional symbol, though the situation is ambiguous: we have a rose (and we think here of Dante or, perhaps because the "roots" are "dark," of Blake or Roethke), yet at the same instant the rose seems to be a thing both external to the poet (i.e., a woman) and part of him as well. The question becomes one of direction — is the rose something that has invaded him (his infatuation with an Other) or is it something already resident in the poet, buried deep in his soul, crying to emerge? Because Antoninus' affair with Rose Tunneland, the divorced Mexican dancer, occasions the poem, the first possibility seems the obvious. However, the first line is telling: the rose is crying in his heart; that is, we do not necessarily have a movement inward "through rock-ribs" of "stony flesh," but possibly a movement outward to the "loam of life" which is psychic wholeness. In this sense, the rose be comes symbolic of the poet's feminine aspect, and the move ment of the poem, the unfolding "petal by crimson petal, leaf by leaf" of the rose, becomes as much a figurative enactment of the poet's emerging recognition of his own androgynous nature as a specifically sexual circumstance. On the one hand, the monk finds in the body of his woman "The Sign of God"; on the other, it is the "splendid flesh of the Rose" of his anima which reveals to him the core of his religion and affords him regeneration. Throughout the sequence's five sections, Whitman's Adam is transformed into the Christ-figure, the poet crucified, hav ing nailed himself "to the Mexican cross, / The flint knife of her beauty." Of course such symbolism is perhaps rather un extraordinary given Everson's situation — a monk whose vow of celebacy is undergoing a rigorous test — but it works on a level deeper than the immediate. According to Jung's studies, the cross (which is a primary symbol in Rose) "is a many faceted symbol, and its chief meaning is that of the 'tree of life' and the 'mother,' " certainly an instrument of pain, but one leading to regeneration.17 Further, Christ's crucifixion (which the poet here re-enacts in the passion of his own life) is often identified with a passing into androgyny. In his Sermo Sup positus Augustine writes, 299</page><page sequence="13">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Like a bridegroom Christ went forth from his chamber, he went out with a presage of his nuptials into the field of the world. . . . He came to the marriage-bed of the cross, and there, in mounting it, he consummated his marriage. And when he perceived the sighs of the creature, he lovingly gave himself up to the torment in place of his bride, and he joined himself to the woman forever.18 Jung points out that the sense of the Christ-figure himself as androgynous has played a crucial role in the Christian tradi tion, relating specifically to the Ademic myth: The Church symbolism of sponsus and sponsa leads to the mystic union of the two, i.e., to the anima Christi which lives in the corpus mysticum of the Church. This unity underlies the idea of Christ's androgyny . . . which is no doubt connected with the Platonic conception of the bisexual First Man, for Christ is ultimately the Anthropos.19 300</page><page sequence="14">EVERSON AND JUNG In A ion, Jung goes on to remind us that iconography often pictures Christ with breasts (in the manner of "The New Birth" from the Rosarium philosophorum secunda pars alchimiae de lapide philosophico, Frankfurt, 1550, above), "in accordance with the Song of Solomon 1:1: 'For thy breasts are better than wine.' "20 Finally, the "symbol of the hermaphrodite, it must be remembered, is one of the many synonyms for the goal of the art"21 of alchemy, which like poetry seeks to reunite the contradictions of the fallen phenomenal world into their primal unity. The scandal surrounding the publication of The Rose of Solitude in the more conservative quarters of the Church can thus be seen as a reaction not so much to the situation of the sequence (in 1967 a narrative of a monk's fall, especially a felix culpa, would raise few eyebrows) but rather in the Law rentian implications of Everson's erotic vision: My act lives. From its life delivered I stand free. Of the Rose renewed I rise, I rise. I stand free. In the wisdom of the flesh, In the truth of the touch, In the silence of the smile Redeemed. ("Immortal Strangeness") And further, I have said before: All the destinies of the divine In her converge. To love her more Is to love self less. And to love self less Is to love God more. To love selflessly Is to love: 301</page><page sequence="15">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Him in her. Amen. ("On the Thorn") As the Christ figure, Everson, like Whitman's Anthropos, finds regeneration not in mortification and denial. Rather, as these powerful poems trace the poet's sexual dark night in his con flict with the flesh, it is finally his submission to his passion for the Rose — the woman within — which affords him whole ness: " 'When the devil / Can't find a way / He sends a woman.' / So does God." IV The influence of Jung, then, on both Everson's sense of the poet's mission and on his writing from the Catholic period es pecially has been profound. I do not mean to imply, however, that Everson is a mere epigone, an apologist in verse for Jungian thought. Poets as diverse as Robert Creeley, Robert Duncan, and Denise Levertov have asserted the Romantic notion of the poem as "given," of course, and thus have aligned themselves at least to an extent with the shamanistic tradition. Among post war poets of consequence, however, only Allen Ginsberg, it seems to me, matches Everson's enduring trust in the poet's prophetic vocation, a trust that for Everson if not discovered was at least confirmed and deepened greatly through his con tact with analytical psychology. Further, through long-term study of Jung's basic concepts Everson was able in poems like The Rose of Solitude sequence and River-Root to more fully explore the rather dark and dangerous territory opened in Amer ican poetry by Whitman, and thus settle on what has come to be his overriding concern — the reconciliation of the anima and the animus as the salvific principle.
