Literacy instruction needs to develop from a sense of a new role for schools, as a place where the ideological complexities (including the inequities) of literacy sponsorship are sorted through and negotiated. Basic literate ability requires the ability to position and reposition oneself among literacy's sponsoring agents as well as among competing forms of communication. —Deborah Brandt ("Sponsors of Literacy" 198) esearch Scene; It is late January, and the light is fading quickly at 5:00 p.m. in Flint, Michigan. Liberty, a young woman with whom we've been working for the past three years, escorts us and our two assistants into her aunt's beauty salon in one of Flint's decaying neighborhoods. We arrive much later than expected, having just finished a long lunch at a local restaurant following a full morning of conducting interviews with Liberty's parents at their home. Now, at the salon, at closing time, her aunt and her Bump Halbritter is associate professor in the Department of Writing, Rhetoric, and American Cultures at Michigan State University (MSU). He is the current editor of CCC Online, and the author of Mies, Cameras, Symbolic Action: Audio- Visual Rhetoric for Writing Teachers (Parlor Press, forthcoming). Bump's research and teaching interests include audiovisual rhetoric and writing, documentary film, composition pedagogies, rhetoric theory, and literacy research. Bump is founder and director of the MSU Documentary Lab.Julie Llndquistis professor of writing, rhetoric, and American cultures at MSU. She works in rhetoric, sociolinguistics, literacy, composition, and cultural studies. Julie is author of A Place to Stand: Politics and Persuasion in a Working Class Bar (Oxford Press, 2002) and, with David Seitz, Elements of Literacy (Longman, 2008).

We immediately begin to haul in equipment, and set up cameras and microphones to a roomful of sighs and rolling eyes. We get the distinct feeling from h er family members that "Lib 's done it again "—whatever "it" is—and that every person here is exhausted after a long day's work, wanting only to close up shop and get home. Still, Liberty's folks are accommodating.: anything for Lib. An hour later, we are hard-pressed to bring the conversation to a close: everybody has something to say, and then something more. As they speak, we listen—and we watch Liberty, who has invited us here to meet the people in her life, to have us listen to them help her tell her story. We wonder, from her reactions, if that's what Liberty hears them doing. In a dance of engagement and withdrawal, she shifts from leaning forward eagerly in her seat to slumping in her chair, eyes downcast, listening. The more comfortable her relatives seem to grow with us and our cameras and microphones, and the more easily the conversation flows, the more Liberty slumps in her chair. Everybody at the salon seems to have relaxed into the strangeness of the occasion. Everyone, that is, but Liberty. Liberty is working. Scene of D iscovERY: LiteracyCorps Michigan This scene describes events from the fourth of a four-phase, video-based, interview methodology for operationalizing discovery in scenes of literacy sponsorship. It is not the only methodology to employ audiovisual technologies for the collection and distribution of literacy narratives: that is, its data. Consider, for example, Cynthia L. Selfe's Digital Archives of Literacy Narratives (DALN) project, which also includes video-based testimonies among its corpus of narratives. These are collected by way of the project's online submission process, or videotaped at conferences such as the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC). The project's methods aim to "provide a historical record of the literacy practices and values of U.S. citizens, as these practices and values change." Each object of DALN's collec tion is a "literacy narrative," which DALN defines as "simply a collection of items that describe how you learned to read, write, and compose." DALN provides a wide array of suggestions for potential contributors: This collection might include a story about learning to read cereal boxes and a story about learning to write plays. Some people will want to record their memories about the bedtime stories their parents read to them, the comics they looked at in the newspaper, or their first library card. Others will want to tell a story about writing a memorable letter, learning how to write on a computer or taking a photograph; reading the Bible, publishing a zine, or sending an e-mail message. (DALN FAQs) From the stories it aims to collect, we may posit the sorts of stories that DALN will be able to tell about its corpus: stories about the broad and expansive practices of a highly, traditionally literate community. DALN assembles an archive of tales from</page><page sequence="3">Operationalizing Discovery in Literacy Sponsorship 173 the inside—an archive that promises to characterize the evolving variety of largely recognizable literacy practices of a community of self-identified and reflective liter ate people. As such, the DALN project will offer a tremendously valuable archive of both our literate behaviors and the stories we tell about them. But what if we want to learn not about ourselves, but about those who may not feel prepared to offer a "literacy narrative"? What if we determine that we also need to learn about the complex web of relationships that foster or discourage—that sponsor—the transmission of information and culture of those whose reading and writing activities may not fit DALN's list just quoted—at least not immediately? WTiat if we suspect that collecting the literacy narratives we most need to hear, for some at least, may take more than one sitting? What if we imagine, also, as Kenneth Burke suggests, that the scene of narrative—its telling and collecting—may be vitally important to the act of narrative? The story that follows emerges from these questions. It started as a hunch shared by two writing professors that what they most needed in order to teach their students well was to learn more about their students' strategies for success—to learn more about not only their students' literate practices, but the sorts of lives they en vision beyond college that may license such practices—or not. Consequently, our project aims at collecting and generating a very different, but complementary, set of stories than does DALN. It aims to collect tales from the outside: ones that may not be recognizable on first look and listen—to the teller or the listener—as stories of literacy. And it follows from our suspicion that to collect such stories, we would need to do more than ask our students simply to tell them: we would need to go find these stories—together, researchers and students. This is a story about developing a narrative methodology for inquiring into literacy sponsorship, and about how video can function as both a tool and an actor in that effort. It is a story of researchers learning to learn—not only front the research, but also through it. It is, as we have come to understand, a story about learning to operationalize the discovery of forms and meanings of literacy sponsorship. We have found that discovery can be enabled by a purposeful deferral of disciplinary inter pretation at particular stages in the research process—a deferral enabled by strategic uses of the meaning-making potential of time, careful cultivation of relationships with research participants, and patience. Our efforts to theorize the workings of this method—to lay claim to a methodology—have led us to the work of pragmatic philosophers, narrative theorists, documentarians, and qualitative methodologists, as well as (to our surprise) writings by philosophers of medicine. In exploring the theoretical implications of our approach to literacy research, we hope not only to offer a new approach to asking and answering questions, but also, in putting these in relation to the idea of literacy sponsorship, to contribute to current thinking about what sponsorship is and can mean.</page><page sequence="4">174 College English In describing the phases of this methodology as intentional, inventional mo ments, we will make reference to experiences from our own long-term research project, LiteracyCorps Michigan (LCM). LCM is a study that both follows and departs from Literacy in American Lives, Deborah Brandt's study of the various eco nomic and political impacts of writing in the lives of eighty Americans born within the span of a century (1895-1985). Like Brandt's study, the design of LCM puts interviews with participants at its center; unlike that study, LCM is more aligned with case study than cohort analysis, seeking to learn more about the experiences of a few participants than about patterns of literacy practices via cohort analysis of a larger sample. The methodology of LCM works from scaffolded, collaboratively developed moments of looking (at scenes of sponsorship and stories of sponsorship, via video), listening (to emerging narratives of sponsorship in scenes of interviews), and strategically deferring interpretive closure. These are the methodological features that have emerged as valuable for us over time—features not specific to LCM, but generalizable to similar kinds of studies. What follows is an account of how we came to operationalize our process of discovery. We begin our discussion by offering a general description of the goals of LCM. We then move to a consideration of our methodology in relation to current thinking about literacy sponsorship. Next, we explore what we have learned about making meaning from data generated in scenes of research (interviews and field sites) via rhetorical processes of diagnosis and abduction, and consider the affordances of video in working with narrative data generated in scenes of research. We then explain how these inventive processes are expressed through each stage of LCM's methodology. We conclude with a reflection on the importance of operationalizing discovery for literacy researchers. Operationalizing Discovery We understand a methodology to be a way of imagining inquiries into particular questions. Methodologies are disciplined and systematic; however, they are not themselves actions. Methodologies inform research practices (and vice versa). In considering what a methodology is and does, we find it useful to think in terms of the difference between processes and operations as John Dewey has defined them: Processes are local and temporal, particular. But the relation of means and consequence which defines an operation remains one and the same in spite of these variations. (162) An operation determines any number of processes and products all differing from one another; but being a telephone or a cutting tool is a self-identical universal, irrespective of the multiplicity of special objects which manifest the function. (163) Methods are examples of local processes; methodologies are examples of global operations. A methodology aims for possible outcomes—not actual or specific out</page><page sequence="5">Operationalizing Discovery in Literacy Sponsorship 175 comes. Dewey: "The more adequately the functional relation can be apprehended in the abstract, the better can the engineer detect defects in an existent machine and project improvements in it. Thus the thought of it operates as a model" (163 ; emphasis added). In other words, methodologies look to hypothetical models that may serve as functional improvements to existing models. The methodology for LCM, then, is an outcome of this question: How can we go about trying to operationalize the discovery of invisible flaws in our assumptions about literacy sponsorship? Our approach to learning about literacy sponsorship assumes, like Brandt's, that narrative data is good for understanding something as socially meaningful, and as socially contingent, as literacy. However, it treats narrative as a practice of invention, not only (or primarily) as a practice of reporting. Research interviews—as scenes of production—can be strategically sequenced to elicit narratives as inventive practice: like any other human encounter, an interview is necessarily rhetorical (and therefore interactive and scenic), and it can be intentionally arranged in a sequence of other such encounters to (further) exploit the inventive potential of time, already implicit in the temporal practice of narrative. The research design we have developed has four phases, all of which use videotaped interviews as a primary method of data collection: 1. Personal history interview: introductory interview constructed around three participant selected artifacts, in a predetermined location 2. Scenic interview: follow-up interview informed by viewing of footage from first interview; location chosen by the participant as an artifact or scene 3. Partidpant-generated data: footage of scenes and practices elicited in interviews, collected by participants working alone 4. Field documentary pieces: collaboratively generated digital video pieces (participants and researchers work together to identify scenes and collect or generate footage) We begin with a scaffolded interview sequence (Phases 1 and 2) to discover domains of practice—forms of invention, communication, and sponsorship—and to identify emergent narrative arcs. After eliciting themes and topoi relevant to students' literacy practices, we move to (researcher-sponsored) participant-generated video documents of relevant sites, practices, and sponsors (Phase 3). Finally, we join participants to collaboratively select, visit, and videotape scenes of literacy practices and sponsors in the field (Phase 4). Because this sequence of data-gathering moves is scaffolded to allow each phase to do a certain kind of inventive work (both for interview participants and for researchers), its methodology is abductive and rhetorical, driven by rhetorical principles of kairos and phronesis. Accordingly, the sequence exploits the capacity of video to capture scenic interview data, to document emerging scenes of practice, and, ultimately, to invite participants into the research and production/authoring process. Video footage can be approached as data in several ways: as an audiovisual</page><page sequence="6">176 College English record of places, events, or conversations; as a piece of narrative text; as a record of choices made within a particular kind of rhetorical work; and so on. In fact, we have found that it is the very nature of video to render multiple representations as data that makes it valuable as a research tool, a claim we will explore further. For the purposes of our discussion, we draw examples of our learning through LCM from the case of Liberty Bell, featured in the scene described earlier. We have chosen to focus only on Liberty here because we find ourselves having to choose, for the sake of rhetorical economy, between offering an array of examples from multiple participants, and following the story of one participant through the moves and stages of the research. To best show how the inquiry develops as a set of rhetorical moves, a research relationship, and a productive collaboration, we have chosen to focus on Liberty as one case example. Inquiring into Sponsorship We assume, with Paul Prior, that "writers and readers are inescapably situated in particular places and in the moment-to-moment flow of lived time [....] [Literacy is] not located in acts of reading or writing, but as cultural forms of life saturated with textuality" (qtd. in Seife and Hawisher 2; original emphasis). We find that the narratives produced in scenes of research can not only help us understand experiences of "lived time," but also lead us to those people and places that are significant—and often in ways that are not immediately obvious or intuitive—to literate activity. In seeking to discover these people and places, we find Brandt's concept of literacy sponsorship to be of great value. In her widely cited article "Sponsors of Literacy," Brandt, motivated by the need to situate acts of literacy within social and economic structures and processes, conceived of sponsors as "any agents, local or distant, concrete or abstract, who enable, support, teach, model, as well as recruit, regulate, suppress, or withhold literacy—and gain advantage by it in some way" (166). The idea that literacy could be studied through its forms and patterns of influence captured our imaginations as we embarked on our project: we came to see that this could give us a way to listen to how participants talk about the people and places in their lives, and to hear these as relevant to their experiences of education and its promise. We hoped, ultimately, to contribute to understandings of relationships between literacy and social and economic mobility—assuming, with Brandt, that literacy "is a valued commodity in this economy, a key resource in gaining profit and edge," and that "this value helps to explain [...] the lengths to which people will go to secure literacy for themselves or their children" (169). Yet we were mindful that, as much ethnographic work to date has shown, the question of value is enormously difficult, insofar as various writing and writing practices are variously valued across communities.</page><page sequence="7">Operationalizing Discovery in Literacy Sponsorship 177 Brandt's concept of sponsorship has been useful for researchers inquiring into relationships between literacy and access to social power precisely because it speaks to the uneven distribution of forms of social capital that secure privileges or enable mobility. Brandt originally conceived the idea of sponsorship as a way to direct inquiries away from individual practices of experiences per se, and into social and economic determinants of practices and experiences.1 We, too, are motivated by the conviction that relating local experience to larger systems is critically impor tant; however, we have come to see a different path to that goal through the idea of sponsorship. We have sought to redirect the idea of sponsorship to the project of making meaning of the life stories of individuals, where it can usefully serve as a heuristic for understanding the lived experiences of people seeking to gain access to the rewards (namely, social and economic mobility) of education. In other words, we think the idea of sponsorship can be deployed to help locate forms of influence where we may not otherwise be inclined to look for them. Brandt herself does not follow the implications of the cultural and experiential dimensions of sponsorship in her own research, preferring to work toward conclu sions about larger social and historical patterns. She seeks to understand literacy sponsors "as they appear in the accounts of ordinary Americans," working from a huge data corpus of over 100 interviews to do a content analysis of the stories she collects. "The more I worked with these accounts," explains Brandt, "the more I came to realize that they were filled with references to sponsors, both explicit and latent, who appeared in formative roles at the scenes of literacy learning" ("Spon sors of Literacy" 168). Whereas Brandt codes her massive data set for instances of sponsorship, we work with a smaller data set to learn more about what sponsorship might mean and entail. In other words, we want to know how narratives of things only tangentially associated with what we have come to recognize as sponsorship can be operatdonalized to help us build new theories of sponsorship. We seek to raise questions about how literacy sponsorship operates—what forms of influence count (and when), what kinds of agents can be sponsoring, what manner of agency these have, and in what scenes they may operate. We have come to see that the less visible forms and operations of literacy sponsorship can be accessed by way of a narrative methodology that exploits the inventive capacities of stories—and scenes of stories—themselves. In fact, how scenes are perceived by students to express sponsorship is often as telling as the scenes themselves in revealing how students experience sponsors of literacy. What, for example, might Liberty's storied accounts of schooling, as told to educators in scenes of schooling, reveal about her relationships to schools as sponsoring institu tions? To approach narratives of sponsorship as performances of sponsorship within scenes of research, our approach necessarily considers what it is that narratives—and in particular, narratives in scenes of research, such as interviews—can do for their</page><page sequence="8">178 College English creator-tellers. Stanton Wortham begins his methodological monograph Narratives in Action with three central claims about narratives of self and what it means to work with them: 1) autobiographical narrative does self-inventive work; 2) any account of this work has to address the dynamics of interpersonal interaction, of positioning and repositioning; and 3) any analysis of this process needs powerful methodological tools for understanding narrative discourse (1). Any story produced by a research participant is a product of many things: for example, perceived genres at work (the "life story"; the research interview; the location and setting of the interview); the relationships of those present in the scene (for example, between our interviewee and us as interviewer-videographers, and between us as researcher-colleagues with our own routines); and the presence and proximity of audio and video equipment. Approaching interviews as scenes that do significant inventive work for partici pants aligns with the work of researchers across disciplines using what have come to be known as biographical methods (see, for example, Goodson and Gill; Thom son). Explains life history researcher Rachel Thomson, "[T]he terms 'biographical methods' and 'life history research' encompass a wide range of approaches, defined most simply through a common methodological starting point—the collection and analysis of biographical or autobiographical accounts" (13). Biographical approaches are, according to Thomson, characterized by "their facility to engage with temporal processes" (14). These methods can therefore "escape the limitations of [other] qualitative interview-based studies" by getting "beneath accounts, making visible contradictions between successive accounts and between intentions and practices" (Plumridge and Thomson, qtd. in Thomson 14). With this in mind, we evaluate the products of interviews for their contextual narrative felicity in particular contexts in order to make sense of their presence within an emerging story. James Holstein and Jaber Gubrium remind us that although generic stability or integrity is one way to understand the source of a narrative's coherence, an equally important source of coherence is performative context: "In real-time and in concrete places, narrative control is asserted through what is properly tellable and how proper, accountable stories are to be told. Practice keeps the horizons of stories within local bounds, thus constituting occasioned coherences" (178). What Holstein and Gubrium assert, in other words, is that narrative coherence can be established scenically. Narratives produced within scenes of interview enact a version of the herme neutic process that life history researchers Ivor Goodson and Scherto Gill, following Hans-Georg Gadamer, describe as triggered by "encounters with the unfamiliar" (76). Goodson and Gill consider that "understanding begins when we, as human beings, are prompted by strangeness. Therefore, the hermeneutic task attempts to resolve the dissonance in the experience of the unknown" (76). That narrative meaning emerges dialogically through time and careful attention to the cultivation of rela tionships—in "pedagogic encounters" between researchers and participants—is the</page><page sequence="9">Operationalizing Discovery in Literacy Sponsorship 179 premise of Goodson and Gill's recently published methodological inquiry, Narrative Pedagogy. In that work, the authors argue that a productive (and ethical) methodology of narrative inquiry works like a pedagogy in its knowledge-producing operations. To enable productive storytelling collaborations, then, interviews must be approached as pedagogical encounters in the context of relationships that need to be supported, managed, and developed over time (Thomson 15). Interviews are, at best, dynamic, rhetorical human encounters, defined at every moment by principles of kairos and phronesis. Irving Seidman characterizes the kind of "active listening" necessary for a productive interview as work that "requires concentration and focus beyond what we do in everyday life," and a conscious negotiation of competing needs and impulses—for example, intervention versus receptivity (79). He compares the rhetorical footwork of good interviewing to that which is required for effective teaching: [I]nterviewers—like good teachers in a classroom—must listen while remaining aware of the process as well as the substance. [...] They must be conscious of time during the interview; they must be aware of how much has been covered and how much there is yet to go. They must be sensitive to the participants' energy level and nonverbal cues. (79) Our objective in interviews, then, is to teach participants to teach us how to learn from them. We are learning to diagnose the learning situations that emerge through our encounters. Staging interviews allows each interview to work pedagogically, affording occasions to learn from our participants how best to listen to them. This, in turn, entails practicing the art of abduction (a term we will discuss at some length) both during and following the interview session.2 Diagnosing Narratives of Sponsorship We find the idea of diagnosis useful in describing the process by which experiential meaning may be inferred from scenes of narrative production. In seeking to under stand the logic of our process of making meaning from narrative data, we came across the work of Ronald Schleifer and Jerry Vannatta, two medical doctors trying to make sense of their world by way of nineteenth-century American pragmatic philosopher C. S. Peirce and his nineteenth-century contemporary, fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. Schleifer and Vannatta find Peirce's taxonomy of types of logical infer ence—deduction, induction, and hypothesis/abduction—useful in understanding the moves they make in working toward diagnosis from narrative data. In contrast with deduction ("merely the application of general rules to particular cases") and induction ("the inference of the rule from the case and results"), hypothesis or abduction is "the inference of a case from a rule and result" (Peirce 188). Schleifer and Vannatta</page><page sequence="10">180 College English describe Peirce's hypothesis/abduction as a "logic of diagnosis" (364), a logic that is intrinsically narrative in its operations. Schleifer and Vannatta explain that in medical education, the best diagnostic tool is the History of Present Illness (HPI), in which the patient describes his or her symptoms, locates them in a chronology, and interprets them. "The physician's task in this portion of the interview," they write, "is to understand the patient's story in the context of the nonverbal clues for such things as anxiety, anger, or depression that are also present" (364). As diagnosticians of literacy sponsorship, we have a similar task in working with the stories we help to facilitate. Holstein and Gubrium consider "the auspices under which stories are told," and list among them the normative in stitutions in which narrative practices are produced and regulated: "Schools, clinics, counseling centers, correctional facilities, hospitals, support groups, and self-help organizations [...] provide narrative frameworks for conveying personal experience through time, for what is taken to be relevant in our lives, and why the lives under consideration developed in the way they did" (164). Finding a productive analytical relationship between the what (content) and the how (performance) of storytelling is a necessary part of the work of narrative inquiry. "The complex relationship between storytelling activities, resources, and conditions," they explain—that is, the relation ship between stories and their scenes of production—"poses a serious challenge for narrative analysis" (165). Holstein and Gubrium recommend a technique they call analytical bracketing to allow them to foreground particular dimensions of narrative practice while provisionally holding others in abeyance: what they are describing, in effect, is a strategic way of looking and not-looking, hearing and not-hearing for the purposes of creating spaces for abduction. Audiovisual data can, obviously, facilitate the process of attending to both the what and the how while giving the viewer/hearer more agency over how the bracketing proceeds. Video makes it possible to create a more textured relationship between the what and the how, as it makes aspects of scene immediately available in any given storytelling event. In other words, attention to scene delivers additional resources for abductive processes of kairotic hypothesis formation. To be successful, the diagnostician must know not only something about how narrative operates, but also about how human motives may be revealed in scenes of narrative. Schleifer and Vannatta cultivate in their medical students "the ability to read body language and emotional states as the detectives do in these stories" in order to more effectively "develop hypotheses about the patient's motives, needs, and desires" (3 79). Interestingly, they find that these are the very abilities most likely to atrophy from the effects of the disciplining process of technical training: Schleifer and Vannatta report findings in medical education literature that suggest that "medical students become worse [at diagnostic tasks] as medical school progresses" (364). Medical students "get worse" at diagnostic tasks as they progress through medical school, it seems, because they become too depen</page><page sequence="11">Operationalizing Discovery in Literacy Sponsorship 181 dent on their developing expert knowledge—that is, they rush to discipline-driven conclusions before considering the full range of relevant data. The key to Sherlock Holmes's success, Schleifer and Vannatta point out, is the detective's radically antidisciplinary disposition—his attention, in their words, to the "surprising fact" (369). They say that faulty medical diagnosis—like the failed inferential work of the police in a Holmes story—can happen when physicians/students "follow methods of induction which leads [sic] them to exclude information as irrelevant because they have, from the start, a particular theory in view" (379). To maintain a diagnostic stance in listening to participants' narratives, then, we sought to hold the very disciplinary commonplaces that had motivated our study in purposeful abeyance. Consider, for example, the commonplace that the conditions of literacy have recendy undergone seismic shifts in keeping with the proliferation of new technologies of communication, and that literacy education must be respon sive to these new conditions. In Brandt's words, "Parents and teachers must prepare young people to be writers and readers in forums and genres that they themselves have not necessarily learned in" {Literacy 202). Although faith in the truth of this claim meant that we were motivated from the outset to learn specifically about our students' technological literacies, we thought that asking first-year college students about "literacy" might suggest that we only wanted to hear about their experiences with traditional reading and writing. Consider Brandt's description of the goals of her project: [Tjhe study maintains a primary focus on the acquisition and use of alphabetic script. [. . .] [Tjhe driving concerns have to do with how people say they came to acquire or develop the resources of reading or writing—at all. [. . .] In this study, perhaps because the focus is less on how people practice literacy and more on how they have pursued it, literacy appears less settled than the term practice might imply. ( Literacy 9) Like Brandt, we could see the value of learning what students were actually doing so that we might build meaningful connections to the forums and genres of reading and writing to which we were more accustomed. Brandt concludes, "Young people today encounter a learning climate in which reading and writing coexist with a greater number of alternative communication systems, and this climate invariably affects the meanings and mechanisms of literacy in young lives in distinctive ways" (202). We hoped our study could help us map this learning climate, and possibly even help us better understand some of the most pressing issues of this version of climate change. Yet as compelling as we found the idea of discovering more about the literate gear our students are using in adapting to new climates, the real project that appealed to us was identifying the things they are doing with that gear (or without it, or with other gear altogether). To learn that, we needed to gain access to more than our students' computers and cell phones: we needed to gain access to their lives—to the</page><page sequence="12">182 College English forums that we ourselves had not learned in. Those forums would be the scenes of our learning. We began to hear Brandt's words, "Basic literate ability requires the ability to position and reposition oneself among literacy's sponsoring agents as well as among competing forms of communication" (.Literacy 198), directed at us as researchers. Brandt's recognition of forums and genres that are familiar to students yet un familiar to teachers began to speak to us more in terms of scenes of social interaction and cultural prestige than in terms of technologies of production and transmission. We began to ask, what don't we know about the ways students make sense of the world? How do we position our own form of literacy sponsorship among those forms of cultural sponsorship that we have not yet identified? We saw that getting to know our students' literate lives would involve more than learning about their historical encounters with what we are in the habit of recognizing as literate activity. For us to be able to sort through, negotiate, position and reposition ourselves among our students' sponsoring agents, we would need to know as much about their values as we have time to learn and patience to discover. It seems easy enough, for instance, to be able to identify overt and covert prestige from any particular point of view. What seems far more difficult is identifying the legitimacy of covert prestige—of covert sponsors—a move that demands more than recognition by way of pointing. Such a move entails not only identifying what we do not currently know about our students' lives, but also squaring those valuations—once we identify them—with our own normative values as educators. Operationalizing discovery in scenes of literacy sponsorship, it seems, is a process not only of identifying new cultural values and their implications, but also of creating new relationships to older values and practices of literacy.3 Of course, this costs time—a by-product of the deliberate, strategic deferral of diagnosis. Discovering "Invisible Flaws" Given the goals of her own study, Brandt screened very specifically for forms of lit eracy that would be most recognizable: "the acquisition and use of alphabetic script" (Literacy 9). Consequently, it only makes sense that Brandt's screening should extend to the transcription of the stories she collects. Brandt writes, All quotations from the interviews have been edited into standard written English with hesitations, misstarts, and pauses eliminated. [...] Dropping the hesitations and misstarts risks loss of nuance, but in each case I have listened carefully to the contex tual meaning of passages I have chosen to quote to be sure that such editing would not flagrantly distort meaning as I understood it. What is gained by these decisions, I hope, is greater clarity and efficiency for the reader. {Literacy 13-14)</page><page sequence="13">Operationalizing Discovery in Literacy Sponsorship 183 Brandt's focus here is on linguistic variation largely characterized by "hesitations" and "misstarts": that is, by performance error, by "nuance." And even though she explains that "all interviews were tape recorded and subsequently transcribed" (17), Brandt's transcription methods ask that we take her at her word—that she, indeed, has "not flagrantly distort[ed] meaning as [she] understood it," because all that we have access to is her transcription of the interviews, not the interviews themselves. How could we? Tape recordings do not stick to the printed, paper pages of books. Consequendy, this piece of practical logic renders a corresponding intellectual logic: that what matters most in these interviews is what best fits traditional literacy and its traditional mediation. Brandt's editorial move takes the language of sponsors, be they of overt or covert prestige to her audience—those for whom she is attempting to render "greater clarity and efficiency"—and makes these sponsors speak the dialect of overt prestige. Her move does more than eliminate flaws in linguistic performance; it marks the speakers and the ideas they communicate as insiders—as believers of a shared value system. Brandt's attention to readers' needs for "clarity and efficiency" necessarily moves the sponsors she identifies from their own "delivery systems," "causes," "forums," "genres," and "existing trade routes" to those of the readers. Given Brandt's empha sis on sponsors of traditional, alphabetic literacy, this editorial priority makes good sense: these sponsors are already recognizable to readers. Accordingly, the trust we place in the fidelity of Brandt's transcription seems to require more of a surrender to inevitability than a leap of faith. Of course, that is because readers have already taken that leap. Disciplined read ers believe in the operations of scholarship and its traditional mediation: alphabetic literacy. And, as Brandt admits, even if readers are trained in linguistic transcription, as she is not (Literacy 13), such transcription would likely afford even the linguists less clarity and efficiency. As Brandt argues, marking some speakers and not others with phonetic transcription marks outsiders quite visibly. Brandt's standardizing is done in the spirit of "evenhandedness" (14), and ensures that all participants enjoy the markings of the readers' overt prestige. We asked ourselves: what if we didn't surrender to the inevitability of alphabetic transcription? What if we found a way to make Brandt's audio recordings stick to those paper pages? What if we decided to value not only the hesitations and misstarts, but also the embodied performances of those we interview? What if we believed, as Burke suggests, that "the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of scene" (3)? What if we believed that alphabetic literacy was actually getting in the way of certain understandings of the literate lives of our students—not just as a subject of study, but especially as a means of study?</page><page sequence="14">184 College English What this did to us was to make us pick up some video cameras. Documentary scholar Bill Nichols describes the products of videotaping as both "indexical" and "ethical": As a machine, the camera produces an indexical record of what falls within its visual field. As an anthropomorphic extension of the human sensorium the camera reveals not only the world but its operator's preoccupations, subjectivity, and values. The photographic (and aural) record provides an imprint of its user's ethical, political, and ideological stance as well as an imprint of the visible surface of things. (Representing 79) Though the footage we collect is most certainly marked, significantly, by our collecting and editing choices, sharing it with others does not require our acts of transcription—or even description. That is, sharing that footage—especially in highly indexical, un- or minimally edited forms—does not require us to speak for our participants. And those video products have enabled us to show actions and in teractions that we would otherwise be required to describe in alphabetic text. Once described, the analysis essentially stops, as readers must trust (or not) the interpre tations rendered in descriptions because they have no direct access to those actions and interactions apart from our or any author's description of them in alphabetic text. Once transcribed, the dialectical leveling of standard edited English must also be accepted by readers; however, as video products, all speakers mark themselves, not by way of phonetic transcription, but by way of lived performance and enacted cultural identification. Brandt is careful to remind us of this flaw of alphabetic transcription and description when she describes the pains she took to maintain "evenhandedness," explaining that "in each case I have listened carefully to the contextual meaning of passages I have chosen to quote to be sure that such editing would not flagrantly distort meaning as I understood it" {Literacy 14). Video representations give authors and their readers/viewers/auditors a common text to study; they do not offer direct access to the actual, ephemeral, historical events they represent. However, they do provide direct and unchanging access to the video-based evidence they represent. We know that video footage offers representations, and not reproductions of events. Nichols explains, "Representations are what the text constructs: 'truth claims' not simply of what exists in the world but, in a strong sense, of what meaning, explana tion, or interpretation should be assigned to what exists in the world. It is here that elements of narrative, rhetoric, style, and representation commingle" {Representing 116). Video representations are not impartial windows on the events they mediate. However, they are stable texts that invite readers/viewers/auditors to perform their own, potentially competing analyses of the actions and interactions they mediate. Video representations can help move readers/viewers/auditors closer to the scenes of action and interaction they represent. They cannot transport readers/viewers/</page><page sequence="15">Operationalizing Discovery in Literacy Sponsorship 185 auditors back in time; however, as texts, they can attempt to freeze particular views of moments in time. Because sponsorship is an activity that must be claimed and defended, providing audience members with access to evidence of sponsorship is critical to qualifying such claims. Without such evidence, it can be difficult to, in Brandt's language, position and reposition ourselves among literacy's sponsoring agents as well as among com peting forms of communication. And so, in the abstract, the thought of video can point to flaws in the existent machine of discovery in scenes of literacy sponsorship. To invoke more of Dewey's language from the first epigraph, rather than see discovery in scenes of literacy sponsorship as a method or as a local, temporal, and particular process—that is, defined and delimited by what it is—we can begin to approach such inquiry as an operation, as a self-identical universal, irrespective of the multiplicity of special objects that manifest its function. Thus, the thought of audiovisual-based discovery in scenes of literacy sponsorship can operate as our model. That thought—independent of the instances in which it is overtly exempli fied—may find its meaning in the possibility of its actualization. In short, using audio and/or video as more than a note-taking device for the author's sole use demands a retooling of more than the author's office supplies. It demands a retooling of the methodology—the operation—that will make deliberate use of the pedagogical value of digital video across the study, from collection to presentation. To return to Dewey: "The thought of an object as an ideal therefore deter mines a characteristic internal structure or form. This formal structure is only ap proximated by existing things. One may conceive of a steam engine which has a one hundred per cent efficiency, although no such ideal is even remotely approached in actuality" (163). We have claimed that we are offering a methodology: a means for operationalizing discovery in scenes of literacy sponsorship. Video—audiovisual recording—is a machine within this methodology. As such, the audiovisual record of what falls before its visual and aural fields offers an indexical approximation of the ideal for which it has been appropriated. That ideal may offer 100 percent efficiency in terms of transporting an audience back in time to a specific scene and event. As Nichols claims, documentary "grounds itself in evidence that cannot be witnessed as it happens, on a first-hand basis, more than once" (Representing 116). And although the audiovisual record produced by way of video recording is not 100 percent ef ficient, it is the most efficient means at our disposal for creating multidimensional representations of ephemeral events. As long as we do not believe that video rep resentations actually satisfy that ideal, we may read the texts that they yield along a continuum of indexicality—one that follows a dynamic arrangement of moments that convey a high degree of indexicality to moments that convey a high degree of authorial perspective and/or voice.</page><page sequence="16">186 College English Nichols claims that " [d]ocumentaries are not documents. They may use docu ments and facts, but they always interpret them. They usually do so in an expressive, engaging way. This lends documentaries the strong sense of voice that nondocu mentaries lack" (Introduction 147). Nichols has also claimed that "[technique, style, and rhetoric go to compose the voice of documentary: they are the means by which an argument represents itself to us (in contrast to the means by which a story does in fiction)" (Representing 140). And it is voice that Nichols uses to distinguish docu mentaries from nondocumentaries: Nondocumentary films such as scientific films, surveillance footage, and informational or "how to" films exhibit a minimal sense of voice: they function more like documents than documentaries, conveying information in a straightforward, often didactic man ner. They speak about aspects of the world with a high degree of transparency and indexicality. (Introduction 147) The video products that are demanded by this methodology must, at times, partici pate in highly indexical, nondocumentary acts, and at other times must participate in highly rhetorical, documentary acts. At times they must speak for the researchers/ authors. At other times, the researchers/authors must speak byway of them. In other words, this methodology regards the audiovisual record represented by video more in terms of what it does than what it is. Even though documentary scholar Michael Renov describes documentary as "the more or less artful reshaping of the historical world" (11), we have eschewed the term documentary, per se, as we are suggesting that the audiovisual products created for and offered by way of this methodology must perform many rhetorical duties and participate in many rhetorical acts. As such, these products must be available for consideration and reconsideration in a variety of edited and unedited forms. Of course, our aim here is not to develop a rationale for accommodating digital video. The aim is to operationalize discovery in scenes of literacy sponsorship: to establish global means for identifying surprising facts about our students in order to expose our own largely invisible assumptions about how best to teach them. The ultimate goal is to determine whether our teaching enhances or interferes with our students' ability to learn from us. Video is the filter that, as Peter Elbow suggests, may help us reveal flaws in our currently invisible assumptions by helping us enter into "different ideas or points of view—ideas that carry different assumptions" (18). Yet video, in and of itself, will not simply, magically provide this access. By focusing on video, we can begin to re-operationalize the scaffolding of narrative events within a disciplined practice of discovery. When we approach our video data as scenic, we are seeking knowledge in the same way Schleifer and Vannatta describe with respect to scenes of action in detec tive novels, where "the scene is planted with unlikely data that is discovered through</page><page sequence="17">Operationalizing Discovery in Literacy Sponsorship 187 the caricature of expert knowledge and experience" (367). Our aim is to rewrite the assumptions we bring to a literate situation in order to situate those assumptions not only in our history of experience, but in the scenes we access. And because we don't expect to recognize the unlikely on our first visit, we need to collect or record as much data as possible from the scene of interview to enrich our later reflections on the scene. However, because these are not scenes of crimes, they do not feature yellow-taped perimeters that prevent others from tampering with their contents. These are the dynamic scenes of life. Consequently, audiovisual data collection best addresses researchers' needs to revisit these scenes in search of unlikely evidence. Scene, Story, Action We have suggested that abduction, the process by which we make meaning of nar rative data, must pay attention to the contexts of elicitation and interpretation that best enable its operations. We have argued that because the interview situation is such a context, attention to the situation as scene further develops the potential of interviews to enable narrative invention and abduction. The move to scene—both as an invention heuristic for data collection and as a methodological feature that favors the audiovisual data of video-based recording—is a significant departure from literacy research that seeks to learn about current practices of literacy against the background of historical trends. In honoring the rhetorical affordances of interviews as scenes for narrative practice, we see Seidman's general approach as one that attends to the affordances of space and time in understanding meaning—as well as to the interview scene as one configured by human relationships. For Seidman, "the purpose of in depth interviewing is not to get answers to questions, nor to test hypotheses, and not to 'evaluate' as the term is normally used." It is, instead, driven by "an interest in understanding the lived experience of other people and the meaning they make of that experience" (9). For Seidman, the interview is not itself a methodology, but a method that must be theorized as part of a methodology; the interview is a machine within the operation of inquiry. With these concerns in mind, we have built on the design Seidman recommends, itself created by researchers Kenneth Dolbeare and David Schuman (Schuman, 16-19). Dolbeare and Schuman's three-interview sequence is designed to work as a scaffolded series of rhetorical scenes for the enactment of narrative data at particular moments, building in time for invention and reflection—for abduction. • The first interview establishes the context of the participants' experience. • The second invites participants to reconstruct the details of their experience within the context established by the first conversation.</page><page sequence="18">188 College English • The third encourages participants to reflect on the meaning their experience holds for them. In this design, the overall experience depends as much on the time between interviews as within the interviews themselves. In making meaning from storied data accumu lated over time, our process works very much like the one that life historian Rachel Thomson, speaking of her own work with adolescents, describes: "In the first stage of the analysis of individual cases I took a very grounded approach to analysis of the data, identifying themes inductively. I did not deliberately seek to draw connections between interview accounts, but inevitably found my analysis of the second and third interviews reflecting back, drawing my attention to earlier statements that had not previously seemed to be important" (Unfolding Lives 22). We would describe our process in the same way Thomson characterizes her own: as "initially incremental, progressively cumulative and ultimately recursive" (22). Seidman, Madeleine Grumet, Janet Gunn, and many others who theorize nar rative methods agree that storytellers engage constructive and reconstructive activity to accomplish some goal-directed end, whether realized or subconscious. Because video makes it possible to show participants scenes from prior interviews, using this medium facilitates analytical bracketing and makes the interactive, constructive, and reconstructive nature of narrative data more visible—and audible. Our interview sequence invites participants to edit their emerging stories deliberately in response to new scenes and to the already-said, making it possible for them to intervene in the emerging narrative, editing past and projecting future narrative events. Thomson describes this process as "the reflexive project of the self' as theorized by Anthony Giddens (9), an idea that is very like "Schutz's notion of the 'project of action' within which the actor propels himself into the future by reflecting on and remaking the past." Writes Thomson, "[I]n this approach the subject is the author of their own biography, self-conscious, constantly engaged in identity work, and seeking narrative coherence, if only on a transitory basis" (22). Video representations, in these scenes of review, participate in facilitating a process of collaborative invention. The potential of scene to evoke or repress, expose or conceal in a given place and time bespeaks a fundamental premise: that staged interviews can be approached as opportunities for scaffolded learning, not only sequential editing—for generating new knowledge, not for correcting inconsistencies in the record. This means that the best questions in an interviewer's repertoire may be those articulated by scene, not agent—questions emerge through complex situations of inquiry, not simply through lines of inquiry. In what follows, we describe each phase of our methodol ogy as a particular scene of inventive and abductive opportunity. Each elaborates and also holds accountable what has emerged in prior scenes. In each phase, we are listening—and watching—for both the stories and the actions of storytelling to carry forward into the next scene.</page><page sequence="19">Operationalizing Discovery in Literacy Sponsorship 189 Phase 1: Artifacts Interview Functions • to establish the relational ground between participant and researcher • to establish rhetorical ground (genre, language, terms of engagement) • to introduce the interview as a scenic event • to build a narrative infrastructure to support stories that emerge in later moments • to locate the beginnings of possible narrative trajectories • to introduce scenes of audiovisual recording For the first scene of interview, participants are invited to tell stories of self that help to establish the scene of future inquiries. We ask participants to bring three "artifacts" of their choosing—things that represent their past, present, and future selves—items that can serve as heuristics for formulating lines of questioning within the scene of the interview itself. This first encounter, then, does the important work of begin ning to establish a rhetorical and relational ground for the next phases: our objective here is to demonstrate to participants that they are entering into a relationship that will invite and enable invention. In this phase, the inquiry is directed not so much toward discovering "information" about students' lives as toward eliciting narra tives of experience that will let us make inferences about the work these narratives do for participants in their lives. With literacy researchers Kate Pähl and Jennifer Rowsell, we assume that artifacts have great inventive power in eliciting narratives of experience. As Pähl and Rowsell explain, "[Ojbjects carry emotional resonance, and these infuse stories." Artifacts "uncover people and epistemologies," so that researchers may discover participants' "embodied understandings of the world" as these are related to "the sensory nature of place and space, and artifacts as performed and expressed in stories" (11). The Phase 1 interview asks students to do real inventive work; the artifacts sup ply participants with heuristics to facilitate this process and also contribute to a scene of dynamic, rhetorical human encounter, defined at every moment by principles of kairos and phronesis. They serve, in other words, as foils for the predetermination of researchers' expert knowledge about literacy. In the hands of participants, the artifacts come pre-loaded with stories about why they were selected, why they are important, and the roles they have played in the students' lives. The artifacts are always surprises—wild cards—that lead us toward productive listening and away from formulating particular questions in advance. We have found that artifacts can be all manner of things, most only peripherally related to reading and writing: participants have brought, for example, soccer balls, dorm room keys, teddy bears, and quilts. Our first questions to participants are those directed by the artifacts themselves. (For</page><page sequence="20">190 College English example, why did you bring this? Does it tell the whole story of your past? What else might you have chosen? Tell us about the people with whom you use this.) In this way, we learn not only about what participants perceive to be most important in their lives, but also how their priorities and commitments—their social or cultural values—may have shifted over time. We also hear how participants narrate their lives according to things they determine to be important to them. What we are left with after the Phase 1 interview is a preliminary landscape of life history, social networks, and current practices from which to work in later ses sions. We position the emerging stories as a critical step in establishing the ground for investigating forms of sponsorship: educational histories, community influences, and scenes of valued participation. A soccer ball provides opportunities to ask not only about sports, but about team members, community involvement, the nature of the interviewee's soccer training, how the interviewee participated in knowledge communities about soccer, and more. By not asking directly for stories about liter ate experiences, we make it possible to see narrative arcs that may be developed and serve us later. And, as we saw in the opening scene of this article, these artifacts are often items of comfort and security—stuffed animals, well-worn soccer shoes, even quilts and blankets. The artifacts give us access to stories of scenes of sponsorship and also offer access to the students themselves by helping students feel comfortable, secure, and authoritative in this new and potentially unsettling scene. Additionally, this initial encounter does the important work of introducing participants to the video cameras, microphones, lighting equipment, and crew who will help define the scenes of inquiry throughout the interview sequence. Phase 2: Scenic Interview Functions • to constitute and enable further data about sites of literacy practice and sponsorship • to establish a new scene of story to help carry forward, abduce, and develop the narratives elicited in Phase 1 • to locate a theme in the emerging story • to establish the terms of collaboration and invite participants to feel more agency in the process • to shift the labor relationship between participant and researcher (to give the partici pant more control over his or her labor in the context of the study; to move from "job interview" to more entrepreneurial labor) The Phase 2 interview creates more opportunities for invention by changing the scene of the narrative encounter: now that the participant has told a version of her story in Phase 1, she is asked to suggest a location in which her story can be furthered. By asking participants themselves to determine the scene for the research encounter</page><page sequence="21">Operationalizing Discovery in Literacy Sponsorship 191 in this phase, we make a critical, ethical move that reestablishes the terms of col laboration and returns agency to the participants. Shifting the scene of interview in this way has the rhetorical effect not only of interpreting the stories that have begun to emerge in Phase 1 (a heuristic provided by the choice of location itself), but of directing, as do the chosen artifacts in Phase 1, particular narrative arcs. For example, when Liberty decided to hold her second interview in the Michigan State University (MSU) Auditorium, she was using that place to help project herself into an imagined space. Her location at center stage, before rows of seats to be filled by an audience, helped her to invent her story of herself as the public figure she ultimately imagined herself to be, reaching again into her past to create the origin story for that future. As we have indicated, the goal in Phase 2 is not to "correct" the data previously acquired; rather, it is to serve as an additional scene of invention for participants—and to invite the participant to experience more agency with respect to the emerging story. In fact, crafting a consistent story across scenes may be far less productive than listening for variation in stories across scenes and for the types of storyable items employed in their service. Phase 3: Participant-Generated Video Functions • to move the emerging narrative into an actual scene of practice or sponsorship made visible or available in Phase 1 and/or Phase 2 • to give participants control over the data collection process • to give presence and voice to significant literacy sponsors • to move the researchers out of the immediate scene in a deliberative act of scene changing • to invite participants to take further entrepreneurial and authorial control of the emerg ing narrative(s) In Phase 3, participants go without us to collect video data in scenes that have emerged as significant in the first two interview phases. One goal in this phase is to invite students to move further into entrepreneurial roles with respect to their own story, a process initiated in Phase 2. Another is to abduce from the two earlier scenes of interview what further attention to other scenes might now supply: specifically, in locating these inquiries in an actual scene of practice or sponsorship, we situate the developing narrative and open opportunities for further invention. Now that narrative themes have been identified in earlier phases, interviewees document their current literate infrastructures by taking a camera and narrating their own video based stories. We prepare participants for this move by co-constructing the story that has emerged so far, in the first two phases, and then by inviting them to supply the visual and scenic pieces that they believe might "complete" the story. In the first</page><page sequence="22">192 College English part of Phase 3, we ask, what would we need to see and hear, and who would we need to meet, to provide a more complete understanding of the story? After participants have produced Phase 3 footage, we collect their unedited videotapes (with the assurance, of course, that they are welcome to further edit the material for their own purposes if they choose). Once we have previewed the foot age, we arrange a follow-up meeting with the participant-author to review it, noting important moments, clarifying contexts, and planning, together, for the Phase 4 sessions to follow. If Phase 2 demonstrates to participants that researchers are also working for them, Phase 3 hopes to inspire further trust in the collaborative nature of the study and its researchers. Phase 3 entrusts participants with significant amounts of both video hardware and authorial freedom to pursue the inquiry that matters most to them. We do very little beyond giving participants some technical guid ance about how to operate cameras to prepare them for this work. We have chosen to give participants high-definition, consumer-grade video cameras that look like the kinds of video cameras people use to record home movies. These cameras have several critical advantages: they are easy to operate, they deliver consistently decent audio and video, and they allow the participant-investigator to enter scenes with a minimum of technological distraction to all involved. We have found that what the footage may lack in production sophistication, it makes up for in spontaneity, ethos, and authorial voice. Critically, Phase 3 provides access for participants to work ethnographically within the study, taking researchers, by way of the videotaped footage, to places where their presence as outsiders would mark very different scenes of activity—as we see in Phase 4. Phase 4: Field Documentary Functions • to continue to move into scenes and create footage of practice and sponsorship • to meet and interview literacy sponsors shown as relevant or made visible in earlier phases • to invite researchers back into the story as interested collaborators • to forge connections between researchers and the participants' community In Phase 4, following their introduction to video-based research and authoring, participants become collaborators in collecting video data in scenes of practice and sponsorship revealed in the footage shot on location in Phase 3. In this phase, we accompany interviewees to their home communities and elsewhere to interview literacy sponsors identified either in or by way of the earlier three phases. Whereas in Phase 3 participants make decisions about the people, events, and locations that will become subjects of the footage they create, in Phase 4 we return to the story to co-direct it toward questions relevant to our research questions—following the narrative threads and literacy indicators revealed in Phase 3 footage. We find that</page><page sequence="23">Operationalizing Discovery in Literacy Sponsorship 193 the presence of researchers in these scenes of practice and sponsorship again funda mentally changes these scenes, eliciting new narratives and performances that reveal histories and experiences. For example, after we reviewed the footage that Liberty created on her own and delivered to us in Phase 3, we again discussed with her the story we were seeing and hearing so far, and asked her to tell us about her decisions in making it. We then asked her to arrange for us to meet the people who had appeared in the video and to set up interviews with others she had mentioned. We met several members of Liberty's family, and interviewed them in local scenes that had been important to Liberty's literacy development: for example, her living room, a nearby diner, and her aunt's beauty salon. In these scenes, we were able not only to hear the stories that Liberty's family and friends told about their own lives, about life in her hometown, and about Liberty herself, but to observe Liberty in these new scenes of telling. In Phase 4, the variety of people and places visited all become scenic elements that help researchers learn more about the primary research participant. If Liberty's narrative and performative actions were fitted to the MSU Auditorium in Phase 2, they were fitted in Phase 4 not only to these largely familiar people and places, but to the new dynamic of having researchers—who were both studying her and collaborat ing with her—in the presence of people who knew Liberty well, yet were meeting the researchers for the first time. In this scene, it is likely that everyone involved may see each other in an entirely new light. Phase 4, with its MSU researchers and full production crew with multiple cameras and microphones, repositions Liberty back in front of the camera—as the subject of all of this interest—even as it positions her alongside of those researchers as she participates in the inquiry, and even as it positions her in the lead as she directs the research crew to follow her to the people and places she has arranged for them to visit. Phase 4, considering all goes well, is an ethos-building event for everyone involved. And it can be so only after a stable relationship of respect and trust—of collaboration—has been established between the researchers and the participant. Such a relationship takes time and attention. How much time? As in all relation ships, that is determined by those involved. The methodology attempts to provide a temporal or attentional structure, but the relationships themselves will determine how the phases are situated in time. Building relationships is an operational feature of the methodology; as such, each one will be constructed uniquely. We think changes in the local methods—the ad hoc moves that respond to each subject and interview—may grow from the methodology without compromising it. The four phases and their functions are the stable and portable operation; the potentially multiple stages of and between those four phases are necessarily expansive to fit the rhetorical demands of each participant. We recommend approaching this methodology with expansive flexibility: that is, we recommend against abbreviating the four phases, but expect</page><page sequence="24">194 College English that local conditions may ask for more, not less. And we recommend flexibility in approaches to videotaping these appended meetings, with decisions about when, and even if, to turn on the cameras to be directed by the operational, relationship building goals of the methodology. We have discovered that participants may need time to vent, question, make suggestions, or even melt down in the presence of researchers. In any collaborative effort, we appreciate the need for collaborators to be able to take things off the record. While we suggest a rigorous and consistent, multi-camera approach to videotaping the four phases of the methodology, we also suggest that the demands of fostering potent collaboration should ultimately direct the use of videotaping. Time, Invention, and Collaboration In speaking of the benefits of long-term qualitative biographical research, Thomson assesses such approaches as "suited to an exploration of the relationship between agency, structure, and serendipity [...] into the human methodology through which risks and opportunities are mediated—the 'art of life'" (14; see Rutherford). We see a richer understanding of the "art of life," thus described, as highly relevant to disciplinary knowledge about literacy sponsorship as it has been traditionally un derstood. When we devised LCM, we hoped that our four-phased approach would enable inventive relationships that would become increasingly generative over time, and that the various interview scenes would come to have real meaning and value for participants as spaces of invention. Now that we have moved through all the phases of the study, we are able to see how each phase functions in relation to the others, what kinds of moves each enables, and how essential time is to the process. Participants need time to experience themselves as inventors of their own stories and to come to know us as researchers. Researchers need time to build relationships with participants, to understand the terms of collaboration, to dwell in processes of abduction within and between stages, and to edit video data in ways that support the process and yield useful and ethical products. What we have elaborated is a highly deliberate approach to listening and look ing that operates from core values associated with rhetorical approaches to literacy research: specifically, faith in the heuristic and ethical importance of motives, scene, and abductive logic. Note that while we have prescribed the use of digital video as a way of having more interpretive control over scenes in which stories of literacy sponsorship happen and are abduced, we have not described how, specifically or conceptually, to mic or photograph the scenes of the methodology—decisions we have labored over with painstaking detail in our own study. We have found that such decisions are to be determined, ad hoc, in each scene of each interview. Researchers must determine for themselves the best angles from which to see the events and the</page><page sequence="25">Operationalizing Discovery in Literacy Sponsorship 195 best ways for hearing the most relevant sounds of the scene—including precisely whose voices need to be recorded during interview segments. It may be useful, in fact, to think of the series of inventive moments and abductive moves we have described as a methodology of improvisation—as a way of assessing and selecting appropriate keys and tempos in which to create multi-vocal compositions in real time: a practice of skilled opportunism that entails the capacity to build meaningfully on the emerg ing compositions of others in pedagogic encounters. We believe we are not only setting forth an approach that can render multivalent narrative accounts of students' experiences of literacy sponsorship, but also describing a more productively collaborative approach to literacy research. Although coauthor ship is a value held by many literacy researchers, it continues to be a difficult goal to achieve. Cynthia Seife and Gail Hawisher, for example, choose to make interviewees "coauthors," though this move is met with a bit of skepticism, as expressed by some of their "collaborators," the most ambivalent being Mary Sheridan-Rabideau: "I never felt a sense of ownership nor the ability to direct the project [...]. However, I never thought I should have that responsibility either." She supports her claim primarily on grounds of invention and arrangement: I didn't shape the guiding questions or really much of the analysis [...]. The way my story was elicited and situated as part of the book project made it feel less like my story. Again, I feel this is the nature of this type of research and I fully support [Seife and Hawisher's] research project. It's just the term co-authoring feels like something else to me. (qtd. in Seife and Hawisher 22) A phased approach can invite a variety of collaborative authoring opportuni ties. It can offer participants a form of research collaboration in which investigative, authorial, and editorial control is not (only) an ethical gesture offered after the data have been collected and mediated for publication, but is, rather, an integral part of the data collection process—that is, the compositional process—itself. By asking students to begin their series of interviews with us by bringing artifacts to serve as the basis for questioning, we are anticipating this editorial process while striving to avoid overdetermining students' inventive process from the outset. We, too, value coauthoring, but we assume that when and how participants enter—and how they perceive the stakes and value of their participation—are important considerations. Although conventional wisdom dictates that for informants' stories to be authentically their own, researchers must try to interfere as little as possible with narrative data, we assume from the outset that sometimes "authentic" data is by nature collaborative. Moreover, opening strategic opportunities for coauthoring can have the effect of making spaces for participants to resist the pressures of conventional narrative forms and genres. Beginning by asking questions about the use and meaning of ar tifacts can help to disrupt the gravitational pull toward normative emplotments of</page><page sequence="26">196 College English events—or at least, to redistribute them in time. Holstein and Gubrium acknowledge this pull toward normativity, explaining that "features of narrative practice may also be formally designated or constrained, especially in a contemporary world replete with formal organizations, interest groups, and bureaucracies. Personal stories are increasingly geared to institutional agendas, with preferred plot structures, 'points,' or morals" (173). Working from artifacts is a way of working with and against pro cesses of what Holstein and Gubrium call "formal narrative control" as asserted by the interview situations. We now see that the extent to which narratives appear to be subject to this kind of narrative control may be one feature of their literate repertoires. Holstein and Gubrium write, "Job interviews, eligibility screenings in social service agencies, psychotherapy sessions, medical interviews, and the like are all arranged to elicit particular kinds of stories, following partially predetermined story lines" (175). We have had the strong sense, after listening to some students, that these particular students were performing narratives that they implicitly understood to be appropriate in institutionalized, interview-ish situations more generally. One of the things we think our interview sequence does is to make visible these implicit forms of narrative control in participants' performed narratives, while at the same time of fering students opportunities to move outside of these conventional narrative frames into inventive possibilities often unavailable to them in situations they understand as serving some "official" function (situations that, in their experience, come with evaluations and rewards). Students' beliefs about where and when stories of self are appropriate in educational settings are, themselves, expressions of literacy histories. We have found that the learning curve entailed by our approach to literacy research is operative not only in the methodology we offer, but also in each story of each case of a literate life as it is followed, documented, and produced. Each case each participant—not only teaches the project as a whole, but is itself a pedagogical event. Working with participants is very much like working with students, in that the challenge is to learn from them what it takes—what forms of trust, ways of engag ing knowledge, and arcs of time—to teach them. Good teachers learn repertoires of listening, responding, and relationship building; the same is true of researchers using abductive methods that rely on chronos, kairos, and phronesis. When it comes to literacy, both teaching and researching involve collaborative learning by way of abduction. A methodology for inquiry into literate lives, such as the one we offer, acknowledges that researchers must teach participants to, in turn, teach the researchers how best to learn from them—that is, how to diagnose the learning situations they present. And although this is not an efficient research model by most measures, we believe the exploratory work it does is critical for understanding the terms of the work of literacy researchers and writing teachers alike.</page><page sequence="27">Operationalizing Discovery in Literacy Sponsorship 197 Notes 1. Specifically, Brandt noted that although writing studies had shown great interest in the literacy development of individuals, it had been less inclined to extend this focus to the "larger contexts of profit making and competition" (Literacy S 56). 2. We have found few models in our home discipline of interviewing as a rhetorical methodology— models in which interviews are treated as inventive acts, and in which invention happens interactively, collaboratively, over time. Narrative research in general remains undertheorized, we believe, for two reasons: first, compositionists are in the business of making it possible for the institutionally powerless (for example, students) to enter public discourses (and they want to hear these voices "in good faith": a laudable goal); and second, discussions of narrative inquiry tend to be off the radar in a discipline that has, in many ways, defined itself against narrative as a social and meaning-making practice. So while our field appears to have embraced the qualitative interview as a method, we have had to look to work in other disciplines for rich conversations about what interviews are and do and make happen. Our approach to interviewing, then, is informed by work in disciplines including folklore, education, and anthropology, in which field interviews have a history of being treated as multidimensional and problematic. This line of inquiry is not new in other fields, but we have found productive syntheses (for example, Goodson and Gill; Thomson) published only recendy, and outside the United States. Rhetoric scholar and literacy historian John Duffy's work among Hmong Americans is a notable exception to this pattern. Duffy, who has used interviews to access data about the historical development of literacy in the Hmong community, has taken important steps toward theorizing interview methodol ogy. Duffy's purpose, as he describes it, is to "examine a methodological approach to literacy research that considers the perspective of participants in the historical development of literacy," in which oral testimonies function as a "vital methodological tool for understanding [. ..] literacy traditions and edu cational needs" (87). Duffy goes to some length to defend interviewing as a legitimate form of collecting oral testimony, a move we believe speaks to the durability of prevailing disciplinary commonplaces. The interview situation, as Duffy describes it, "invites a connection between the researcher, who is in a sense the supplicant, and the speaker, who represents the guide or teacher" (95). Duffy's work helps us see how the researcher-rhetorician might approach the diagnostic work of finding the literacy—a term not present in the stories of experience that serve as data—in the stories he or she helps to facilitate. 3. The abductive approach to diagnosis and the quest to identify and make instrumental competing cultural values required that we assume a rhetorical position very much like playing Elbow's famous (but never operationalized) "believing game," which he describes as "the disciplined practice of trying to be as welcoming or accepting as possible to every idea we encounter: not just listening to views different from our own and holding back from arguing with them; not just trying to restate them without bias; but actually trying to believe them" (16). Elbow has claimed that our "best hope for finding invisible flaws in what we can't see in our own thinking is to enter into different ideas or points of view—ideas that carry different assumptions" and that "only after we've managed to inhabit a different way of thinking will our currently invisible assumptions become visible to us" (18).
