In their early critical works, Northrop Frye, Basil Willey, Walter J. Bate, Ernest Tuveson, and M. H. Abrams established British empiricism as a central point of reference for their accounts of romantic poetry and aesthetic theory. Earl Wasserman did not initiate, but con solidated this establishment when, in 1964, he emphasized the eight eenth-century empiricist heritage of the romantic poets and affirmed that, especially for them, "epistemology is poetically constitutive."1 The challenge of de Man's essays of the sixties derived, in part, from the fact that they did not contest the dualistic epistemological moorings of ro mantic studies. In "The Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image" (i960), the gap between the subject ("consciousness") and the object ("the natural object") is a premise of the argumentation. In "The Rhet oric of Temporality" (1969), de Man gestures towards a dismissal of the dialectic of subject and object in designating it as simply "a passing moment in [another] dialectic, and a negative one at that, since it rep resents a temptation that has to be overcome."2 But this only means i.

SiR, 29 (Spring 1990) 39</page><page sequence="2">40 WILLIAM WALKER that the dualism which Abrams and Wasserman saw the romantics attempting to negate or transcend remains as an essential recognition of the rhetoric of temporality: "... the prevalence of allegory always corresponds to the unveiling of an authentically temporal destiny. This unveiling takes place in a subject that has sought refuge against the impact of time in a natural world to which, in truth, it bears no resem blance" (RT 206). That allegory is in an essential sense an assertion of dualism (between a subject and a natural world), and that this assertion is primary to the hard-nosed romantics is again made clear when de Man claims that allegory "prevents the self from an illusory identification with the nonself, which is now fully, though painfully, recognized as a nonself. It is this painful knowledge that we perceive at the moments when early romantic literature finds its true voice" (RT 207). Allegory entails the temporality of consciousness because it is a form of allusion to pre-existent texts, and because it makes an epistemological assertion. That is to say, de Man sees allegory as the rhetoric of temporality not only because the allegorical sign refers to another sign that temporally precedes it, but also because it insists on the difference between a subject who knows and an object that is known (the object is known, at least, to be a nonsubject which bears no resemblance to the subject). Allegory negates symbol, in part, by affirming the dualism of self/nonself which symbol attempts to transcend or efface in a spatial, nontemporal totality. For the early de Man, the central romantic experience consists of the conflict between the allegorical representation of the self which affirms the temporal predicament by both referring to previous signs and rec ognizing the self to be distinct from the natural world, and a symbolic representation of the self which is simply a defense against this affir mation. Because he understands allegory to include the assertion of dualism and makes this assertion essential to the definition of the tem poral self, de Man here remains congruent with the established concep tion of romanticism as an engagement with an issue that was seen to lie at the heart of empiricist tradition. In a review of books on German literary tradition by Erich Heller and Ronald Gray, de Man writes that "Nietzsche could rightly be crit icized for having warned too much [against the degradation of the human spirit] and perhaps for not having thought enough." Needless to say, this was written before Nietzsche's text appeared in British romantic studies of the seventies as a marked alternative to the texts of Locke and Hume which, however, continued to occupy a privileged position.3 The appearance was most vivid in the early issues of Diacritics. 3. De Man's review, "The Literature of Nihilism," appeared in the New York Review of</page><page sequence="3">ENLIGHTENED NIETZSCHE 41 This journal was the site of Harold Bloom's presentation of Nietzsche as a central psychologist of post-Enlightenment poetic revision and of Coleridge as one of the first test cases. And in his review of M. H. Abrams' Natural Supernaturalism which appeared in the second volume of Diacritics, J. Hillis Miller unabashedly brandishes Nietzsche as a club to beat Abrams' critical presuppositions regarding imitation, seculariza tion, language, and interpretation. In the same volume, de Man's well known reading of The Birth of Tragedy is brought to bear on the issue of whether or not a genetic conception of history is characteristic of romanticism.4 By demonstrating the deconstruction of the genetic pat tern in Nietzsche's text, de Man would seem to have us infer that romanticism does indeed undermine the authority of this conception and the conceptual categories it implies ("subject, intent, negation, to talization, supported by the underlying metaphysical categories of iden tity and presence" [GG 82]). Moreover, "it is instructive to see a genetic narrative function as a step leading to insights that destroy the claims on which the genetic continuity was founded, but that could not have been formulated if the fallacy had not been allowed to unfold. This may well turn out to be an exemplary model in trying to understand the aberrant interpretation of romanticism that shapes the genealogy of our present-day historical consciousness" (GG 101-2). That is to say, a proper reading of Nietzsche's text strengthens our understanding of both romanticism itself and the traditional interpretation of it whose aber rancy lies in a systematic failure to perceive the destruction of the genetic system. The power of Nietzsche concerning the theory and definition of literature and philosophy in general was, in the late sixties and early seventies, being gauged by a number of French scholars; in the early Books 6 (June 23, 1966): 16-20.

This relevance is reaffirmed in Leslie Brisman's Romantic Origins (I079)&gt; where Nietzsche's text broaches each chapter, and in Tilottama Rajan's Dark Interpreter (1980), where The Birth of Tragedy is seen to provide a vocabulary and dynamic capable of defining a particular text and mode of romantic consciousness.5 And in the 1979 issue of Studies in Romanticism edited by de Man, it seems that (de Man's account of) Nietzsche's deconstruction of the genetic system has become exemplary: "the validity of a genetic or generational model for literary history, " de Man writes in his introduction, "is one of the received ideas the papers leave behind."6 But what have proven to be at least as powerful in romantic studies as the interrogations of the genetic model of history, interpretation, revisionary historical consciousness, and Greek tragedy, are Nietzsche's explicit writings on rhetorical and conceptual structure. If the papers edited by de Man leave behind the genetic model of history, they also, as Rajan observes, invest in the notion developed in Allegories of Reading, "that the text repeats and thematizes its figurai structures in scenes of writing and reading. " This concern with figurai structure and, more specifically, with "the substitutions of structures of consciousness by structures of language" is what Thomas Pfau has recently identified as "the most significant transformation of the paradigm of subjectivity within the study of romanticism." "The essential romantic question," he goes on to claim, "in the most general terms, concerns the relation between structures of consciousness and those of language. "7 It is pre cisely the interrogation of this relation which, in the first half of Allegories of Reading, de Man teaches to be the persistent and most metaphysically devastating articulation in the Nietzschean oeuvre. Mediated principally by de Man, Nietzsche's tropological critique of metaphysics is, I suggest, a primary document of the contemporary understanding of British ro mantic poetry in its rhetorical and conceptual dimensions. Because the notion of a self and the notion of an object or thing confronted, recognized, or known by this self are victims of this rhe 5.

The move from empiricist epistemology to Nietzschean rhetoric results in the liquidation of the conceptual premises and investments of the former, and permits a radical reformulation of the main problems and insights of romantic literature. I want to show that, in one crucial respect, the move from empiricism to Nietzsche is no move at all. 2 It is not, as de Man argues, that the empiricist theory of language is a theory of tropes, but, as Abrams and Bloom intimate, that its theory of ideas, its psychology, is. To put it another way, the structure of specific tropes is most clearly defined not in Locke's explicit consideration of words in Book in of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, but in his consideration of ideas in Book n.8 Consider, for example, Locke's account of the association of ideas. Besides the "natural Correspondence and Connexion" of some ideas, there is another Connexion of Ideas wholly owing to Chance or Custom; Ideas that in themselves are not at all of kin, come to be so united in some Mens Minds, that 'tis very hard to separate them, they always keep in company, and the one no sooner at any time comes into the Understanding but its Associate appears with it; and if they are more than two which are thus united, the whole gang always inseparable shew themselves together.9 8. Abrams writes that the eighteenth-century psychology of literary invention grounded in empiricism was not without precedent: "it should be remarked that there was less absolute novelty in this contribution to criticism than appears at first. Much of the procedure was, very simply, to translate the existing commonplaces of traditional rhetoric and poetic into the novel philosophical vocabulary of mental elements, faculties, and events" (The Mirror and the Lamp [Oxford: Oxford UP, 1953] 157). This observation resurfaces, fifteen years later and without acknowledgement, in an essay by Bloom: "when the Associationists?Locke, Hume, Gay, Hartley, Tucker being the progression of its founders?developed their psychology, they founded it (perhaps unconsciously) on the topics or commonplaces of rhetoric, precisely because they wished to usurp the place and function of rhetoric" ("Poetic Crossing: Rhetoric and Psychology," The Georgia Review 30 [1976]: 508). I agree with Abrams and Bloom's sense of the congruence of empiricist psychology with rhetoric, but find that it is best explained not in terms of topoi but tropes. This point in itself deeply qualifies de Man's argument that Locke's theory of language is a theory of tropes ("The Epistemology of Metaphor," Critical Inquiry 5 [1978]: 13-30). A proper critique of de Man's argument would, however, require a more extensive exposition which I cannot include here. 9. John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, ed. Peter H. Nidditch (Ox ford: Clarendon, 1975) 395. Further page references are to this edition and are included in the text.</page><page sequence="6">44 WILLIAM WALKER Throughout the rest of the chapter, Locke emphasizes that ideas which are connected through custom, chance, and education become insepa rable and always appear together in the mind. But he also suggests that these ideas can become indistinguishable from one another, that the mind can take one for another, that one can be substituted for the other: a man who has been injured by another man "never thinks on the Man, but the Pain and Displeasure he suffered comes into his Mind with it, so that he scarce distinguishes them, but has as much an aversion for the one as the other" (398); a man who suffered pain in any place or saw his friend die in a room "confounds" the ideas of pain and place "in his Mind" (398); "... where will you begin to rectify the mistakes that follow in two Ideas, that they [Men] have been accustom'd so to join in their Minds, as to substitute one for the other, and, as I am apt to think, often without perceiving it themselves?" (401). In Locke's account of association, there is clearly some tension between accounts of the mind regarding a number of ideas as a single idea, considering some ideas as the constant accompaniments of others, and confounding or substituting one idea for another idea. But the possibility of the replacement of an idea of the cause of pain or an idea of what is temporally contiguous with that pain (ideas of a specific man or place) by an idea of that pain, is the possibility of a metonymy of ideas. If, in the trope metonymy, the name of one thing is substituted for the name of its cause or what is contiguous with it, so in association, the idea of one thing (pain) may be substituted for the idea of what is contiguous with or what caused it (a man or room).10 Locke's treatment of perception is another indication of how his "way of ideas" involves implicit descriptions of tropological structures. In the passage from "Of Perception" which, in the second and following edi tions of the Essay, introduces the Molyneux problem, Locke writes, We are farther to consider concerning Perception, that the Ideas we receive by sensation, are often in grown People alter'd by the Judgment, io. By "trope" I mean, most generally, a substitution of words. According to Quintilian, metonymy indicates an invention by substituting the name of the inventor, a possession by substituting the name of the possessor, that which is contained by substituting the name of that which contains, and cause by subsituting the name of effect. Quintilian also classifies some cause/effect substitutions under synecdoche, since this trope makes us "realise many things from one, the whole from the part, the genus from the species, things which follow from things which have preceded, or, on the other hand, the whole procedure may be reversed." See Institutio Oratoria, vol. 3, trans. H. E. Butler (1920; London: William Heinemann, 1980) 311-18 (vra. vi. 23). Kenneth Burke includes substitutions of cause for effect in his account of synecdoche. See A Grammar of Motives (1945; Berkeley: U of California P, 1969) 507-8.</page><page sequence="7">ENLIGHTENED NIETZSCHE 45 without our taking notice of it. When we set before our Eyes a round Globe, of any uniform colour, v.g. Gold, Alabaster, or Jet, 'tis certain, that the Idea thereby imprinted in our Mind, is of a flat Circle variously shadow'd, with several degrees of Light and Brightness coming to our Eyes. But we having by use been accus tomed to perceive, what kind of appearance convex Bodies are wont to make in us; what alterations are made in the reflections of Light, by the difference of the sensible Figures of Bodies, the Judg ment presently, by an habitual custom, alters the Appearances into their Causes: So that from that, which truly is variety of shadow or colour, collecting the Figure, it makes it pass for a mark of Figure, and frames to it self the perception of a convex Figure, and an uniform Colour; when the Idea we receive from thence, is only a Plain variously colour'd, as is evident in Painting. (145) The key term here is "alter," and, as usual, the key term is the one Locke plays on: judgment alters ideas received by sensation and alters appearances into causes; the difference of sensible figures makes altera tions in the reflections of light. Locke's own text is no exception to his observation in Book m that it is difficult to find "a Discourse written of any Subject, especially of Controversie, wherein one shall not ob serve, if he read with attention, the same Words (and those commonly the most material in the Discourse, and upon which the Argument turns) used sometimes for one Collection of simple Ideas, and sometimes for another ..." (492). This kind of play on key terms is what makes it difficult to understand clearly the process Locke is describing. But one reasonable way of understanding it is as an activity of mind by which ideas of cause and effect are transposed. For in Locke's example, the idea of sensation the mind has imprinted in it is the idea "of a flat circle variously shadow'd," or of "a Plain variously colour'd"; the idea formed by the judgment is the idea of "a convex Figure, and an uniform Col our. " Whether by mutating the idea of sensation or taking it as a sign (making it pass for a mark) of the idea of judgment, the mind ultimately frames or has imprinted upon it the idea of judgment. Though the process by which the transformation occurs is not designated as substi tution, this is the end result: ideas of judgment take the place of ideas of sensation, and the mind takes these ideas of judgment as ideas of sensation. As Locke puts it after the inserted Molyneux example, "we take that for the Perception of our Sensation, which is an Idea formed by our Judgment" (146). What invokes this taking and displacement is a repeated perception of various ideas of sensation, that is, a customary contiguity of ideas (of color, two-dimensional shape, three-dimensional</page><page sequence="8">46 WILLIAM WALKER figure). Locke specifies this contiguity as a causal relation. Because the colored sphere is the cause of ideas of the colored plain (the sphere causes appearances), the idea of the sphere is the idea of the cause of sensation, and the idea of a colored plain is the effect of this cause (not the idea of an effect, but the effect itself). The displacement of ideas of sensation by ideas of judgment in this case is hence the substitution of ideas of cause for an ideational effect. In the rhetorical figure metonymy, the name of a cause (an inventor) may be substituted for the name of an effect (an invention); here, the idea of a cause takes the place of the idea which is the effect of that cause. The structure of the substitution of ideas parallels the structure of a substitution of words that constitutes a particular trope and that functions as a model for the general error of confounding ideas of judgment with ideas of sensation. It may be felt that this understanding of Locke's text is suspect as an instance of what Hans Kellner has recently described as the inflated descriptive and explanatory power granted to tropes in contemporary humanistic studies.11 But both its accuracy and historical legitimacy are enforced by Leibniz in his Nouveaux Essais sur L'Entendement Humain (written in 1703-1704 but, out of consideration for Locke's death in 1704, first published only in 1765). When Philalethe proposes that "the ideas, which come by sensation, are often altered by the judgment of the mind of adults without their noticing," Th?ophile (generally re garded as Leibniz's spokesman) responds, "there is nothing so true." Raising the issue of how painting deceives us, Th?ophile continues: When, then, a painting deceives us, there is a double error in our judgments, for first we place cause for effect [nous mettons la cause pour l'effet], and believe we see directly [imm?diatement] that which causes the image; in so doing, we resemble a little a dog barking at a mirror. For we actually [proprement] see only the image, and we are affected only by the rays. And since the rays of light require time (if only the least amount) it is possible that the object could be destroyed during this interval and no longer exist when the ray reaches the eye, and what no longer exists could not be the object present to the sight. Secondly, we are mistaken again when we place one cause for another [lorsque nous mettons une cause pour l'autre], and believe that what comes from only a flat painting is derived from a body [est deriv? d'un corps], so that in this case there is, at the same time, a metonymy and a metaphor in our judgments; for the 11. Hans Kellner, "The Inflatable Trope as Narrative Theory: Structure or Allegory?" Diacritics n (1981): 14-28.</page><page sequence="9">ENLIGHTENED NIETZSCHE 47 very figures of Rhetoric become sophisms when they impose on us [passent en sophismes lorsqu'elles nous abusent]. This confusion of effect with cause, real or apparent, often enters into our judgment else where. Hence it is [that we believe] that we sense our bodies or what touches them, and that we move our arms, by a direct physical influence, which we judge to constitute the interaction [commerce] of soul and body; whereas, in truth, in this way we sense and change only what is in us.12 In this remarkable passage, Leibniz announces his recognition of Locke's account of the alteration of ideas as an account of rhetorically structured substitution. While Leibniz offers a slightly different explanation of how the tropes are constituted on the level of judgment, his observations make evident that an understanding of Lockean alteration as figuration can claim legitimacy in more than the contemporary fascination with tropology. Besides occurring in discussions of mental processes such as associa tion and perception, detailed descriptions of the ordering and disordering of ideas occupy a central position in Locke's account of specific ideas such as time, space, power, body, infinity, and substance. A remarkable feature of these accounts is that the idea which is their ostensible subject tends to disappear in the process of the exposition. When, for example, we reach the chapter on the complex ideas of substances in Book n, we already know that its subject is about to vanish. For in the final chapter of Book i, Locke tells us that "there is another Idea, which would be of general use for Mankind to have, as it is of general talk as if they had it; and that is the Idea of Substance, which we neither have, nor can have, by Sensation or Reflection" (95). Locke repeats this assertion at the open ing of the chapter on complex ideas of substance, so that the problem immediately becomes that of explaining what ideas we do have, how we come by them, and why they make us think we have an idea of substance. As happens so frequently in Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature, the revelation of the fictionality or nonexistence of the main character in what begins as a narrative of conceptual construction trig gers a genealogy of mental error and bad metaphysics. Within these 12. Gottfried Leibniz, Nouveaux Essais sur L'Entendement Humain, vol. 6, series 6 of S?mtliche Schri?en und Briefe (Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1962) 134-35, my translation. It should be noted that Leibniz goes on to differ with Locke on the Molyneux problem. Also, it is significant that Leibniz finds it relevant to give definitions of synecdoche, metonymy, metaphor, and irony in response to Locke's chapter on clear and obscure ideas (Nouveaux Essais 260).</page><page sequence="10">48 WILLIAM WALKER genealogies, empiricism articulates a complex scene of alteration, sub stitution, taking, mistaking, considering, and compounding which cor responds to the scene of tropes. He who will examine himself concerning the notion of substance in general will find "he has no other Idea of it at all, but only a Supposition of he knows not what support of such Qualities, which are capable of producing simple Ideas in us" (295). Locke again asserts that we "have no distinct Idea of [substance in general] at all, " and appeals to "every one's own Experience" in order to make his point that, in the case of particular sorts of substances, no one "has any other clear Idea, farther than of certain simple Ideas coexisting together" (296). Although he goes on to claim that "we have no clear, or distinct Idea of that thing we suppose a Support" (297), Locke seems hesitant to eradicate entirely the idea of substance as substratum: he still refers to a "supposition," allows for unclear and obscure ideas of substance, and, in the case of particular substances, claims we "have always the confused Idea of something to which they [simple ideas] belong, and in which they subsist" (297). Though approximating an outright liquidation of the idea of substance, Locke's language repeatedly lets up and thereby grants this idea a ghostly habitation in the mind. The idea of substance as substratum or support of properties, then, does not quite not exist. Part of the reason why the mind thinks that it does exist is that the mind is incapable of conceiving, imagining, or apprehending otherwise: The Mind being, as I have declared, furnished with a great num ber of the simple Ideas, conveyed in by the Senses, as they are found in exteriour things, or by Reflection on its own Operations, takes notice also, that a certain number of these simple Ideas go constantly together; which being presumed to belong to one thing, and Words being suited to common apprehensions, and made use of for quick dispatch, are called so united in one subject, by one name; which by inadvertency we are apt afterward to talk of and consider as one simple Idea, which indeed is a complication of many Ideas together; Because, as I have said, not imagining how these simple Ideas can subsist by themselves, we accustom ourselves, to suppose some Substratum, wherein they do subsist, and from which they do result, which therefore we call Substance. (295) Out of its imaginative failing when repeatedly confronted with a com bination of several ideas, the mind takes no idea at all or an obscure and confused idea as an idea of something from which the properties of which it has ideas flow (perhaps because it is difficult to see how the</page><page sequence="11">ENLIGHTENED NIETZSCHE 49 mind could take no idea as an idea, Locke postulates a supposition and a confused obscure idea). Another way of describing this process is to say that the mind takes no idea as an idea, and takes ideas of properties as ideas of effects, results, products, accidents, or properties of that of which it has no idea.13 But if, in fact, the mind has no idea of a subject in general which causes properties, or in which properties inhere, neither does it have any idea of an effect, accident, result or property?these ideas presuppose the idea of a subject of which something is an effect, cause, accident or property. Just as the concept of the sign is determined as the concept of a sign of something, so the concept of a property is determined as a property of something.14 The mind takes no idea (noth ing, or possibly a confused idea) as an idea, then, and takes ideas it does have (for example, the idea of the color gold) to be ideas it does not and can not have (ideas of an effect, result, accident, or property o/some cause, substratum, substance, subject etc.). More generally, the mind takes nothing for something and something for nothing. Strictly speaking, then, no ideational substitution occurs here. The mental activity being described is not analogous to a substitution of words, but to the delusion of seeing nothingness as words, and words as nothingness. In giving airy nothing a local habitation and a name, in apprehending more than it strictly comprehends, in positing a bringer of joy every time it apprehends a joy, the mind is not so much troping on a specific idea of nothing, as deluding itself in thinking it has an idea. If there are no ideas the mind can substitute or take for other ideas, the possibility for a congruence between the tropological arrangements of words and arrangements of ideas vanishes. But there is clearly a m?to nymie process at work here, since Locke's references to repetition, custom, and what happens "afterward" imply a temporal sequence of linked mental events: the perception of a set of ideas, as opposed to a real essence, is implicitly established as part of the antecedent or cause of the mind's supposition of substance. Not substrata, but ideas observed constantly to go together (in conjunction with a mental incapacity) precede and, it seems, provoke the supposition of a subject that supports properties. The ideas which in fact are (part of) the immediate cause of the supposed idea of substance are taken by the mind as effects of the support it supposes; this support, the supposition of which is in fact an 13. That Locke conflates the notion of cause/effect with that of substance/property is also evident in the chapter on names of substances in Book in where he refers to the support of properties as their cause (442, 450). 14. See Jacques Derrida, "S?miologie et Grammatologie, " Positions (Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1972) 23-50.</page><page sequence="12">50 WILLIAM WALKER effect of ideas constantly observed to go together and the mind's own incapacities, is taken by the mind "as the cause of those ideas. Because Locke implicitly explains mental processes in terms of conditions which lead the mind to behave in a certain way, he ends up describing a form of metonymy: the mind takes a set of ideas as the effect of a cause (substance); the postulation of this cause is shown by Locke to be the effect of those ideas. To use a sentence from one of de Man's essays on Nietzsche, "what had been considered to be a cause, is, in fact, the effect of an effect, and what had been considered to be an effect can in its turn seem to function as the cause of its own cause."15 Such a causal expla nation is not scandalous for Locke, as it would be for Hume, because, in the chapter on causality which shortly follows that on substance, Locke finds it legitimate to speak of ideas of cause and effect. It never theless evades the critique of notions of cause and effect which the discussion of substance approximates: that the mind has no idea of the cause of any set of properties (and, so, no idea of properties of any substantial cause) does not prevent Locke from construing a causal account of mental processes. Because he reinvests in concepts which his own exposition questions, his account of the order and disorder of ideas constitutes an account of a specific trope. In his explanations of specific ideas (or non-ideas) such as substance, then, Locke may be seen to extend the kind of analysis he provides for mental processes such as the association of ideas and sensory perception. This analysis basically consists of an account of how the primary entities postulated by "the way of ideas" are altered, omitted, taken, mistaken, compounded, displaced, reversed, and substituted within mental space. Because these entities are seen by Locke to fall with words under the general category of signs, his descriptions of their alterations can cor respond in important respects to the accounts in rhetorical tradition of alterations of words. I have concentrated on Locke's implicit description of m?tonymie ideational substitutions, but an analysis of his accounts of infinity, space, and time would make clear that synecdochal and metaphorical structures are equally well defined in Book n of the Essay. This definition of the tropological structure of various ideational ar rangements is not peculiar to Locke but is elaborated by major figures in the empirical philosophical tradition. Berkeley, though obviously critical of several positions taken by Locke, is just as clearly allied with 15- "Rhetoric of Tropes (Nietzsche)," chapter five of Allegories of Reading (New Haven: Yale UP, 1979) 107. Further references to this book (AR) are to this edition and are included in the text.</page><page sequence="13">ENLIGHTENED NIETZSCHE 51 him in his treatment of ideas as signs that constitute a language. It is hence possible to read his early essay on vision as an implicit exposition and critique of figurative signification on the level of ideas. And when Hume in the Treatise claims that the principles governing the association of ideas are resemblance, contiguity, and causation, it is apparent that his account of the taking and mistaking of ideas which effect a bad metaphysics of causation, identity, solidity, space, time, and identity is allied with rhetorical classifications of the taking and mistaking of words. Hume acknowledges this, but, ever deferential to the claims of custom over reason, declines to elaborate: But tho' resemblance be the relation, which most readily produces a mistake in ideas, yet the others of causation and contiguity may also concur in the same influence. We might produce the figures of poets and orators, as sufficient proofs of this were it as usual, as it is reasonable, in metaphysical subjects to draw our arguments from that quarter.16 That the empiricists do not implement the highly refined vocabulary of the rhetorical tradition in their articulations of mental activity should not prevent the recognition of the depth of congruence between these two ostensibly hostile traditions of thought. The empiricists' failure to articulate explicitly this congruence is rather an index to the severity of their usurpation and the force of post-Restoration customs and concerns to segregate philosophy and science from what was understood to be the domain of rhetoric. 3 That a sentence from de Man's essay on Nietzsche can serve as an accurate restatement of Locke's account of substance calls for a reassess ment of the rhetorical critique of conceptuality and, ultimately, the interrelations of empiricism, romanticism, and Nietzsche. In order to state precisely the nature of this critique, it will be useful to consider the context of the sentence from de Man which has been appropriated. The sentence occurs early in the fifth chapter of Allegories of Reading, "Rhetoric of Tropes (Nietzsche)," where de Man is commenting on a late Nietzsche passage (which, in some editions, is published under the title Der Wille Zur Macht). Since I shall return to this passage, I quote it in full: i6. David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, ed. L. A. Selby-Bigge, P. H. Nidditch, 2nd ed.

'to understand' simply means: to be able to express something new in the language of something old and familiar17 This is the passage de Man is considering when he writes the sentence that restates Locke's account of substance. But the main point de Man wants to make in connection with it is that the process of mental substitution and reversal is conceived by Nietzsche as a linguistic event: What is here called 'language' is the medium within which the play of reversals and substitutions that the passage describes takes place. This medium, or property of language, is therefore the possibility of substituting binary polarities such as before for after, early for late, outside for inside, cause for effect, without regard for the truth-value of these structures. But this is precisely how Nietzsche also defines the rhetorical figure, the paradigm of all language. (AR 108) After citing a passage from Nietzsche's early notes on rhetoric in which Nietzsche does indeed define metonymy in terms of the substitution of binary polarities, de Man observes "practically the same text that, in 1872, explicitly defines metonymy as the prototype of all figurai lan guage, describes, in 1888, a metaphysical construct (the phenomenalism of consciousness) as susceptible of being deconstructed as soon as one is made aware of its linguistic, rhetorical structure" (AR 109). The impli cations of this observation are clear: what de Man at the opening of his essay refers to as "the neglected and inconspicuous corner of the Nietzsche canon dealing with rhetoric" turns out to be a way of access to Nietzsche's general reflection on the relationship between literature and philosophy. In a statement which reiterates claims from the opening chapter of the book (AR 15) about Proust and what "can be shown" about Nietzsche's metaphysical critique, de Man concludes that the pattern of argument here directed against the concept of con sciousness is the same pattern that underlies the critique of the main 17- Friedrich Nietzsche, Nachgelassene Fragmente, 1887-1889, vol. 13 of Friedrich Nietzsche, S?mtliche Werke, Kritische Studienausgabe, 15 vols., ed.

(AR 109) De Man's accurate restatement of a late Nietzsche passage in which Nietzsche implicitly identifies the structure of metaphysical constructs as rhetorical, then, is what may also function as a restatement of Locke's explication of the idea of substance. I infer that the articulation of the rhetorical structure of specific concepts and mental processes is a point of fundamental congruence between the texts of Locke and Nietzsche. This inference may be confirmed by juxtaposing some early Nietzsche passages with the previously cited passages from Locke. Though de Man is correct in observing that the critique of metaphysical constructs in the late Nietzsche is based on a recognition of their structures as those of specific rhetorical tropes, it should also be remembered that this explicit critique of metaphysical constructs accompanies discussions of rhetorical figures in the early 1870's. Whereas the explicit naming of the structures of specific processes and constructs as tropes is absent in the late Nietzsche, it is pronounced in the work of the early 1870's. Take, for example, the following passage from the first part of what has become known as Das Philosophenbuch: It is on tropes [Tropen], not unconscious reasonings [unbewu?te Schl??e], that our sensory perceptions [Sinneswahrnehmungen] rest. Identifying like with like?discovering some similarity [?hnlichkeit] between one thing and another is the fundamental process. Memory [Ged?chtnis] lives by this activity and continually exerts itself. Con fusion [Verwechslung] is the originary phenomenon?This presup poses the act of seeing forms [Gestaltensehen]. The image in the eye regulates our recognition [Erkennen], rhythm our sense of hearing. We would never achieve a representation of time [Zeitvorstellung] by means of the eye alone, nor a representation of space [Raumvor stellung] by means of the ear alone. The sense of causality [Kausal it?tsempfindung] corresponds to the tactile sense [Tastge?hl]. At first we see images in the eye only in us, we hear sound only in us?from there to the admission [Annahme] of an outer world [Au?enwelt] is a big step. Plants, for example, have no sense of an outer world. The tactile sense and the visual image [Gesichtsbild]</page><page sequence="17">ENLIGHTENED NIETZSCHE 55 simultaneously give two sensations side by side; because they al ways appear together, they awaken the representation of a connec tion [Zusammenhanges] (through Metaphor?for not all things which appear together are connected).18 Perhaps the alteration of ideas of sensation by ideas of judgment described by Locke is what Nietzsche means by "unbewusste Schl??e" and what he wants to distinguish from tropes. But Nietzsche himself describes tropes in terms of "Schl??e": after referring to Tha?es' confu sion of one predicate with a sum of predicates as "metonymy. A false reasoning" [Metonymia. Ein falscher Schlu?], he presents a new section: Logical thought [logische Denken], scarcely exerted by the Ionians, develops very slowly. False reasonings [falschen Schl??e] are better comprehended as Metonymies, i.e. rhetorically and poetically com prehended. All rhetorical figures (i.e. the essence of language) are logically erroneous reasonings [logische Fehlschl??e]. It is with them that reason begins! (DP 132) In a later section on definition, Nietzsche concludes, "therefore, in the essence of synthetic judgment [im Wesen des synthetischen Urteils] lies a Metonymy, i.e. it is a false equation [falsch Gleichung]. I.e. synthetic reason ings are illogical [die synthetischen Schl??e sind unlogisch]" (DP 142). A "Schlu?" is a trope, for Nietzsche, when it is false or illogical. The process described by Locke is false or illogical in the sense Nietzsche means because the mind identifies its ideas of a "flat circle variously shadow'd" with the ideas of light and shape it has previously had in conjunction with ideas of convex bodies. This identification is the pre condition for the subsequent reversal of cause and effect (judgment "alters the Appearances into their Causes"). If Locke describes the mind in the process of following through a "Schlu?," his explication of it in terms of mistaken identification and reversal make it one of those "falschen Schl??e" in terms of which Nietzsche defines "Tropen." In addition, the awakening of a representation of a connection [erwecken die Vorstellung eines Zusammenhanges] described by Nietzsche here is clearly akin to the supposition of substance or cause which Locke describes as 18.

But whereas Locke avoids any designation of this process in tropological terms, Nietzsche emphatically labels it as metaphorical. Nietzsche's account of knowledge in terms of abstraction and cate gorization also restates Locke: The oversight of the individual [das ?bersehn des Individuellen] gives us the concept [Begriff], and with this our knowledge [Erkenntnis] begins: in classifying [Rubrizieren], in the establishment of kinds [Gat tungen]. To which, however, the essence of things does not corre spond: it is a cognitive process [Erkenntnisprozess], which does not reach the essence of things. Several separate traits [einzelne Z?ge] determine a thing for us, not all of its traits: the identity [Gleichheit] of these traits invokes us [veranla?t uns] to comprehend many things under one concept [Begriff]. We produce beings [ Wesen] as bearers of properties [ Tr?ger der Eigen schaften] and abstractions [Abstraktionen] as causes of these proper ties. That a unity [Einheit], a tree, for example, appears to us as a multiplicity of properties, of relations, is anthropomorphic in two respects [ist in doppelter Weise anthropomorphisch]: first, this demar cated unity "tree" does not exist; it is arbitrary to cut out [heraus zuschneiden] 2L thing in this way (according to the eye, according to form); this relation is not the true, absolute relation, but is again tainted by anthropomorphism [anthropomorphisch gef?rbt]. (DP 140) Locke, too, argues that only a limited number of ideas of qualities constitute our idea of a substance such as gold or tree, and that the mind invents a (real) essence or substratum as the bearer, cause, subject, or support of qualities. But he does not label this procedure as an "anthro pomorphism," a term which Nietzsche uses heavily in a cluster of sections from Das Philosophenbuch to refer to all substitutive processes the human animal performs in its understanding of the world. When de Man, writing in a late essay on the third section of Das Philosophenbuch, "?ber Wahrheit und L?ge im Au?ermoralischen Sinne" claims that "far from being the same, tropes such as metaphor (or metonymy) and anthropomorphisms are mutually exclusive," he is baldly neglecting Nietzsche's pervasive use of the term as a general designation of the transpositions [?bertragungen] Nietzsche classifies as metaphor and me tonymy. Commenting on the same listing of tropes in " ?ber Wahrheit und L?ge ..." which is scrutinized by de Man, J. Hillis Miller rightly observes that "the opposition between the similarities of metaphor and the contiguities of metonymy is undone by the fact that both are an</page><page sequence="19">ENLIGHTENED NIETZSCHE 57 thropomorphisms. Both are products ofthat power man has to project himself toward the mysterious X or to put himself under it as its illusory foundation. " Though de Man qualifies his assertion of exclusivity by claiming that "anthropomorphism is structured like a trope," he still fails to recognize that the tropes described in Das Philosophenbuch are regarded by Nietzsche as anthropomorphisms. In the context of this early work, Nietzsche's designation of knowing as an anthropomorph ism is tantamount to a general designation of it as a type of " ?bertra gung," or "rhetorisch Figure."19 One could point to several other passages from Das Philosophenbuch to show that Nietzsche observes the rhetorical structure of various con cepts and mental processes and that he explicitly names them as tropes. His account of the notions of time, space, and causation are particularly striking examples.20 These observations make clear that descriptions of specific tropes in the early Nietzsche, which de Man sees recurring in the late work as deconstructive descriptions of metaphysical constructs, also exist as such explicit deconstructive descriptions in the early work (de Man observes this in connection with a passage from " ?ber Wahrheit und L?ge ..." [AR in]). Explications of the rhetorical structure of specific concepts and mental processes mark both the early and late Nietzsche, though only in the early work are names of particular tropes persistently invoked. These observations also confirm the implication of my appropriation of de Man's text to restate Locke on substance and my earlier claim that de Man misconstrues the way in which Locke and Nietzsche are properly coordinated. It is mainly the theory of ideas presented in Book n, not the theory of language presented in Book m, 19- See Paul de Man "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," in The Rhetoric of Romanticism (New York: Columbia UP, 1984) 243-44; J. Hillis Miller, "Dismembering and Disremembering in Nietzsche's 'On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense,'" Why Nietzsche Now?, ed. Daniel O'Hara (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1985) 47. Nietzsche's use of "anthropomorphism" as a general rubric for specific transpositions such as metonymy and metaphor is evident in Das Philosophenbuch 92-96, 108-110, 142, 160, 164, 186, 192. It is because the anthropomorphisms Nietzsche is talking about in "?ber Wahrheit und L?ge ..." are transpositions that, after giving the listing of "metaphors, metonymies, anthropormorphisms . . . (182)" which de Man scrutinizes, he changes it to "transpositions, metaphors, metonymies" (194). As de Man says, "opportunities to encounter technical tropological terms are so sparse in literary and philosophical writings that one can be excused for making the most of it when they occur" ("Anthropomorphism ..." 241). That de Man neglects another listing of tropes in the essay he discusses is a breech of his own principle commited for the sake of omitting evidence which works against his definition of anthropomorphism. 20.

For Locke's descriptions of the structures of specific concepts and mental processes in Book 11 are, in many cases, tantamount to Nietzsche's descriptions of them as tropological structures. And though Locke's avoidance of tropological terms differentiates his explication from that of the early Nietzsche, it brings his text even closer to the late Nietz schean writings from which these terms are also absent. Of course, given that Locke's theory of language takes the ideas described in Book II as their meaning, one may say that an account of rhetorical structures is implicit in this theory. Locke, moreover, sometimes points to words as enabling, invoking, and preserving various alterations of ideas. Be cause words are implicated in mental process, it is difficult to maintain a hard-and-fast distinction between mental and linguistic processes. But this does not negate the general observation that the model of the trope is most comprehensively invoked in the Essay to describe the movement, alteration, compounding, taking, and mistaking of ideas?the rhetorical figures and tropes constituted by the use of words are not the agents that cause the tropological alteration of ideas, but the analogues to it. The understanding of the order and disorder of ideas as being homologous with the order and disorder of words is the ground of a powerful com plicity between empiricism and Nietzsche.21 That such a complicity should exist will come as no surprise to readers of Nietzsche who know that if the empiricists are criticized in Zur Genealogie der Moral, they receive high praise elsewhere in the Nietz schean oeuvre. Sarah Kofman, whose early essay on Nietzsche de Man dismisses along with those of Jean-Luc Nancy and Phillipe Lacoue Labarthe as "preparatory and tentative at best" (AR 104), observes else where that in Das Philosophenbuch, Nietzsche's "operative concepts (for getfulness, utility, habit) are, then, precisely those of the empiricists."22 It is clear that the empiricist epistemological critique retains its prestige 21. It is worth noting that Leibniz indicates a different way in which Locke's theory of language articulates a generalized theory of tropes (at least in respect of general, abstract terms). Affirming Locke's claim that terms for abstract notions are borrowed from terms relating to the sensible world (Essay 403), Th?ophile says "it will be well, however, to consider this analogy of sensible and insensible things which has served as the foundation of tropes. . . ."He goes on to consider several prepositions "which are all taken from place, distance, and movement, and then transferred to every type of change, order, sequence, difference and agreement. " That is to say, Leibniz sees Locke's principle of the sensible origin of all abstract terms entailing the classification of these terms as tropes. See Nouveaux Essais 277. 22. Sarah Kofman, Nietzsche et la m?taphore (1972; Paris: ?ditions galil?e, 1983) 75.</page><page sequence="21">ENLIGHTENED NIETZSCHE 59 in the later work as well. In the context of the critique of the concept of causation in the later fragments, for example, Nietzsche is explicit in his recognition of Hume as a precursor: The question 'why?' is always the question of the causa finalis, of a 'what for?' We have no 'sense of the causa efficiens': here Hume is right, habit [Gewohnheit] (but not only of the individual!) makes us expect that a certain frequently observed event follows another: nothing more! Moreover, the assessment that "Locke and Hume in themselves were too bright, too clear, i.e., judged according to German value instincts, 'too superficial'" is the grounds for broad remarks on the dependence of Kant on Hume and the belatedness of the German philosophical tradition in general.23 Besides their exemplification of the courtesy, brightness, skepticism, and Voltairian clarity which Nietzsche took to be the positive side of eighteenth-century western European culture, it is their implicit rhetorical critique of metaphysics which underlies Nietzsche's positive appraisal of the enlightened empiricists. This coordination of empiricism and Nietzsche may be observed with out neglecting the differences between them. It is clear that a point of fundamental division is the ontological status of deconstructed concepts such as substance, cause, subject, etc. The liquidation of such concepts (construed as ideas) which is obviously underway in Locke is fully accomplished under the weight of Hume's "no idea without a corre sponding impression." Because central metaphysical constructs simply vanish in the process of the empiricist critique, this critique is compelled to explain why the mind mistakenly thinks it holds such concepts?after a moment of ideational annihilation, the empiricist critique becomes the psychology of an ontological error. The case is clearly otherwise with Nietzsche. If his comparison, in Das Philosophenbuch, of the network of metaphysical concepts to a spider-web approximates the empiricist re duction of it to airy nothing, other images grant this network a much firmer ontological ground in the mind. In the first part of this work, for instance, Nietzsche describes impressions which are first seized through concepts, then marked, killed, skinned, mummified and, having been transformed into a concept, finally preserved. And in " ?ber Wahr heit und L?ge ..." the conceptual network does not vanish but is 23. The first passage is from Colli-Montinari, Kritische Studienausgabe 12: 102; the second is from 12: 340, my translation. For remarks on Nietzsche's agreement with Hume, see Arthur C. Danto, Nietzsche as Philosopher (New York: MacMillan, 1965) 93-95; 109-10.</page><page sequence="22">60 WILLIAM WALKER envisioned as the product of industrious work and construction: it is a beehive or columbarium (DP 138, 192). This difference regarding the ontological status of concepts in the mind coheres with a fundamental difference between visions of mental life. For Locke, the supposition of substance is the effect of a mental lack, an imaginative failure: "not imagining how these simple Ideas can subsist by themselves, we accustom our selves, to suppose some Sub stratum . . . "; the idea to which we give the name substance is "nothing, but the supposed, but unknown support of those Qualities, we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist, sine re substante . . . "; "because we cannot conceive" how qualities could subsist alone, "we suppose them existing in, and supported by some common subject"; "concluding" operations of the mind "not to subsist of themselves, nor apprehending how they can belong to Body, or be produced by it, we are apt to think these the Actions of some other Substance, which we call Spirit" (295-97). In Book in, Locke adds that men suppose that a real essence belongs to every species in order to avoid realizing the fact that "the same Word [signifies] different Things in different Men" (469). Out of its own ignorance, habits, weaknesses, and incapacities or, in the case of association, out of chance and custom, the mind transposes its ideas and thinks it has ideas which in fact it does not. For Nietzsche, the building of concepts is a site of will, power, and, above all, artistic accomplishment. Though he sometimes describes the constitution of concepts in terms of a physiological necessity, Nietzsche emphatically describes it throughout Das Philosophenbuch as a mode of domination and artistic creation: There is a force [Kra?] in us, which allows the main traits [gro?en Z?ge] of the reflected image [Spiegelbild] to be perceived with more intensity, and a force which emphasizes [betont] the same rhythm over the actual imprecision [wirkliche Ungenauigkeit]. This must be an artistic force [Kunstkrafi] because it creates. Its principal means is to omit, to overlook, to ignore [weglassen und ?bersehen und ?berh?ren]. Hence, antiscientific [antiwissenschaftlich]: for it does not have the same regard [Interesse] for all that is perceived [alles Wahrgenommene]. The word contains [enth?lt] only an image, from there the concept [Begriff]. Hence, thought reckons with artistic magnitudes [das Den ken rechnet also mit k?nstlerischen Gr??en]. (70-72) Nietzsche's general interpretation of substitutions and reversals (which both he and Locke observe) as substantial manifestations of an artistic force [Kunstkrafi] and the will to dominate [das Streben nach einheitlichem Beherrschen] (102), profoundly distinguishes his rhetorical critique from</page><page sequence="23">ENLIGHTENED NIETZSCHE 61 that of Locke. The distinction between creation out of strength and overfullness of life and creation out of weakness and impoverishment of life, a distinction which is crucial to Nietzsche's later writings and to his ostensible condemnation of romanticism, captures a central distinc tion between the interpretations of conceptual construction offered by Locke and Nietzsche. 4 If de Man is right in regarding the rhetorical model of the trope as the key to Nietzsche's critique of metaphysics, Locke's repeated invocation and description of this model in his analyses of metaphysical constructs would imply that Locke, too, held the key to the Nietzschean critique. But the texts of Locke and Nietzsche make clear that a critique of metaphysics grounded in the rhetorical model of the trope cannot be comprehensive. We have already seen that in describing the various alterations of ideas in the mind, Locke presumes to know the real order of events, the real cause, and the real effect. Only because he presumes to know when what is really an effect is altered into a cause or when what is really a cause is treated as an effect could we understand his expositions as implicit descriptions of a tropological structure (meton ymy) defined as the transposition of words used to designate cause and effect. This is also clearly the case in the late Nietzsche passage on the phenomenalism of the inner world. Only by not observing this can de Man conclude his section on the two Nietzsche passages by lavishly articulating a possible hope which constitutes the impulse for a further intellectual endeavor doomed to end in the negative conclusion that has already been reached and endured: Would it not follow that, since the aberration turns out to be based on a rhetorical substitution, it would suffice to become aware of this in order to undo the pattern and restore the properties to their 'proper' place? If attributes of time and attributes of cause have been improperly associated with each other, one might be able to un cross, so to speak, the polarities that have been exchanged in order to recover a measure of truth. In the example at hand, we could conceivably eliminate the misleading temporal scheme that led to the confusion, and substitute for the derived cause, mistakenly assumed to have an objective existence in the outside world, an authentic cause that could be inferred from the critical deconstruc tion of the aberrant one. Granted that the misinterpretation of reality that Nietzsche finds systematically repeated throughout the tradi tion is indeed rooted in the rhetorical structure of language, can we</page><page sequence="24">62 WILLIAM WALKER then not hope to escape from it by an equally systematic cleansing of this language from its dangerously seductive figurai properties? Is it not possible to progress from the rhetorical language of liter ature to a language that, like the language of science or mathematics, would be epistemologically more reliable? (AR 109-10) Nietzsche has already undone the pattern, restored the properties to their proper place, uncrossed the polarities, eliminated the misleading temporal scheme, substituted an authentic cause for the derived cause. For he has already claimed that the ostensible outer cause, in fact, reaches consciousness later than effect, that perceptions presumed to be caused by the outside world are, in truth, caused or determined by the inner world, that the mind projects what is really an effect of the outside as the cause of its consciousness of the outside. As de Man himself puts it, "it turns out however that what was assumed to be the objective, external cause is itself the result of an internal effect. What had been considered to be a cause, is, in fact, the effect of an effect, and what had been considered to be an effect can in its turn seem to function as the cause of its own cause" (AR 107). It is precisely because Nietzsche has already done what de Man thinks we may only naively hope to do that, in the passage on the phenomenalism of consciousness, Nietzsche can claim to have learned something, that he can distinguish between the "supposed causal chain" [erfundene Causalit?ts-Kette] and the "real cause" [irklich Ursache], that he can distinguish between what we are conscious of and the "real activity of the world" [eigentlich Aktion der Au?enwelt], that he can assert the "basic fact" [Grundthatsache] of inner experience, that he can identify the "erroneous causality" [irrth?mliche Urs?chlichkei ten] and "false causal fictions" [falschen Causal-Fictionen]. And only be cause it recognizes real cause and effect and how they are reversed can the passage on the phenomenalism of consciousness cohere with the early description of metonymy. For metonymy is defined in the notes on rhetoric not as a critique of the recognition of cause and effect, but as a figure which presupposes this recognition: "a third figure is the metonymy, the substitution [Vertauschung] of cause and effect"; "here, metonymy, the substitution of cause and effect, is complete."24 Nietzsche's metonymy does not hopelessly scramble cause and effect; it 24- A portion of Nietzsche's notes on rhetoric appear in volume 5 of the Gesammelte Werke (Munich: Musarion, 1922) 287-23. They were translated by Philippe Lacoue-La barthe and Jean-Luc Nancy as "Rh?torique et langage," Po?tique 5 (1971): 99-142. The full text of the notes, in German and English, has recently appeared in Friedrich Nietzsche on Rhetoric and Language, ed. and trans. Sander Gilman, Carole Blair, David Parent (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1989). This is the text cited here, 24, 58.</page><page sequence="25">ENLIGHTENED NIETZSCHE 63 is grounded in the possibility of recognizing and categorizing events and things as cause and effect. If his account of metonymy can also function as an account of the phenomenalism of consciousness, it is because in his exposition of consciousness Nietzsche presumes to know how mental events are really ordered, how they are really caused, and how they are transposed. This claim to know the actual order of mental process, moreover, figures in the affirmation of it as a phenomenon of artistic force and the will to power which marks both the early and late Nietzsche. For he justifies the affirmative conception of the rhetorical model which distinguishes him from Locke by outlining how the mind permutes this order in perception and in the constitution of conceptual categories. That is to say that if Nietzsche was the sceptic de Man makes him out to be, he could not affirm the figures of consciousness to be figures of will, of Kraft and Kunstkraft, besides figures of knowledge (and of illogical reasoning). Only because the hope has already been fulfilled and the escape already accomplished can Nietzsche himself pro duce a description, which one may still read ironically, in which nasty, poor, brute mental activity is transfigured into exertions of beauty and power.25 De Man, of course, argues that this is not and cannot be the case. After considering a passage from "?ber Wahrheit und L?ge ..." in which Nietzsche describes moral virtue originating in lies, de Man emphasizes that "the reversal of polarities has not led to a restoration of literal truth": The original pairing of rhetoric with error, as we encounter it from the Course on Rhetoric to The Will to Power was based on the cross shaped reversal of properties that rhetoricians call chiasmus. And it 25- In pointing to de Man's neglect here of Nietzsche's account of rhetorical figures as figures of the will to power and artistic force, I am allying myself with comments on de Man by Bloom ("Poetic Crossing" 506), and Jonathan Arac, "Aesthetics, Rhetoric, His tory: Paul de Man and the American Uses of Nietzsche, " Why Nietzsche Now? 429. I have already cited passages from Das Philosophenbuch which describe ?bertragungen as products of an artistic force and the will to dominate. The explication of the formation of concepts in terms of the will to power pervades the later fragments. The following passage ex emplifies the characterization of this will as an aesthetic will (though this will serves need): The inventive force [erfinderische Krafi], which has made [erdichtet] categories, worked in the service of need [Bediirfiiis], specifically, the need for security, for rapid understandability on the basis of signs and sounds, for means of abbreviation:? 'substance' 'subject' 'object' 'being' 'becoming' have nothing to do with metaphysical truths.?It is the powerful who have made the names of things law: and among the powerful it is the greatest artists in abstraction [Abstraktions-K?nstler] who have created [geschaffen] the categories. (12: 237, my translation)</page><page sequence="26">64 WILLIAM WALKER turns out that the very process of deconstruction, as it functions in this text, is one more such reversal that repeats the selfsame rhe torical structure. All rhetorical structures, whether we call them metaphor, metonymy, chiasmus, metalepsis, hypallagus, or what ever, are based on substitutive reversals, and it seems unlikely that one more such reversal over and above the ones that have already taken place would suffice to restore things to their proper order. One more "turn" or trope added to a series of earlier reversals will not stop the turn towards error. (AR 113) Here de Man concedes part of the point I have just argued: Nietzsche has already reversed the polarities and reversed the properties that the mind had unknowingly reversed. But de Man takes refuge from the possible fulfillment of his hope by attempting to maintain that if Nietzsche has (re)reversed the mind's crossings, he still does not get it right: Nietzsche's reversal is just one more reversal which is not epis temologically privileged over the mind's reversals. But that de Man has no argument is evident from his own rhetorical softening at this crucial moment of his exposition: the restoration of truth only "seems unlikely." The fact dictating this softening is that "the process of deconstruction" in Nietzsche's text is not simply one more reversal. What distinguishes Nietzsche's crossings from the crossings he analyzes is, first, the explicit articulation that crossing is what he is doing and, second, the explicit identification of his own crossing as a correction of a previous crossing which is identified as erroneous, false, and fictitious. That is to say that Nietzsche's "deconstructions" are self-conscious deliberate crossings which claim to correct prior, unconscious, falsifying crossings. That a case of mistaken multiplication and a case of correcting the mistaken multiplication are both mathematical calculations neither abolishes the possibility of being correct nor degrades the correction into just one more mathematical calculation which is as unlikely to be true as all the rest. Similarly, Nietzsche's crossings neither abolish the possibility of restoring things to their proper order, nor make them as unlikely to be true as the errors he explicitly identifies and claims to correct. This is not to say that the notions of truth, reality, proper designation, and knowl edge are not deconstructed in Nietzsche's writing. The point is rather that the critique of these notions does not reside in his observations of the tropological structure of particular mental events and concepts: the rhetorical model of the trope is not and cannot constitute the basis of a comprehensive critique of metaphysics because it defines itself in terms of standard metaphysical concepts (such as cause, effect, identity, tem poral sequence, part, totality, etc.), and in relation to a literal, proper</page><page sequence="27">ENLIGHTENED NIETZSCHE 65 moment of knowing and naming. Because, as Derrida puts it, "meta phor remains in all its essential features a classical element of philosophy, a metaphysical concept," it cannot claim to dominate or deconstruct philosophy.26 The rhetorical model and all of the conceptual analyses grounded in it may themselves be deconstructed by a metaphysical critique constituted by other facets of the Nietzschean oeuvre. If Nietzsche's descriptions of the rhetorical structure of particular mental processes and concepts do not constitute a comprehensive cri tique of metaphysics, neither do those of Locke and the empiricists. The skeptical project of destroying specific concepts in western metaphysical tradition (or of showing that they simply were never there to begin with) is distinct from that of deconstructing the system of this tradition. Empiricism is a major precedent for Nietzsche's tropological critique of specific concepts, but not for the latter's ostensible project of dismantling the western metaphysical system. This is one reason why, when other prominent readers of Nietzsche such as Derrida and Deleuze attempt to approach the Nietzschean critique of metaphysics, they focus not on descriptions of rhetorical structure but on discussions of truth as woman or the discourse of quanta of power.27 5 Nietzsche's writing on trope and concept, particularly as it is explicated by de Man, is a strong text within contemporary studies in romanticism. It is notable that a central accomplishment of this writing is evident in the empiricist text which it considerably displaced as an Ur-text of romanticism. This accomplishment is more difficult to recognize and name in the empiricists because they eschew the rhetorical terminology which is blatant in the early Nietzsche. That it takes Leibniz to tell Locke he is really engaged in a rhetorical critique of conceptuality (that it takes a German writing in French to describe an Englishman as a rhetorician) is indicative of major anxieties in British empiricist tradition (and, it would seem, of a particular configuration of nationalities which is visible in the genealogy of contemporary theory). But this should not prevent the recognition of modes of analysis in this tradition which ally it with 26.

Such a recognition displays significant features of the appro priation of philosophy in romantic studies. The standard treatment of empiricism as simply a document of scepticism ?r dualism seems thin given the degree of conceptual annihilation grounded in rhetorical mod els which empiricism achieves. This is particularly so when one sees that the notions which ground the standard treatment (the notions of a subject, object, substance, perception, etc.) are the victims of this an nihilation. An understanding of the extraordinary conceptual invest ments and liquidations of the empiricist text grants it a pertinence to contemporary romantic studies which was and, for some critics, still is precluded by the dominant readings of the sixties. The turn to Nietzsche and de Man for accounts of "the relation between structures of consciousness and those of language" neglects the refined, if implicit, version of such an account in empiricism. The recognition of this version provides a form of historical legitimacy (should one require it) for the ostensibly ahistorical rhetorical analyses of some forms of contemporary romantic criticism. It also works as an index to the negative conceptual power of Nietzsche's tropological critique and calls for qualifications to de Man's presentation of this critique. Broader historical implications concern Nietzsche's impulse to reevaluate the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries which is evident in the final decade of his sanity.28 To the extent that the British side of the Enlightenment mounts a rhetorical critique of conceptuality, this "epoch" may be seen to persist in a major way in Nietzsche and motivate his positive (though not consistent) later assessments of the eighteenth century. Because he regards romanticism as a reaction against the Enlightenment, against the demand for explanations rather than concepts, Nietzsche, at one moment, dismisses it as incidental to his affiliations with the earlier epoch. Given, however, that the romantics, like the empiricists, are fundamentally concerned with the relation between structures of consciousness and those of language, they, too, must be seen to augment the waters of the great tide which Nietzsche occasionally feels bearing him along. That is to say, the legitimacy of understanding Nietzsche as a romantic derives, in part, from his alliances with the Enlightenment. McGill University, Canada 28.
