WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THEM AND DIDN'T WANT TO USE THEM EXCEPT AS A LAST RESORT THE GEMINI SPACECRAFT, ONLY 20 PERCENT LARGER THAN MERCURY, WAS A TIGHT FIT FOR TWO PERSONS "We (the Gemini astronauts) were concerned about them and didn't want to use them except as a last resort." This quotation from Gemini astronaut Tom Stafford was in response to the question, how he felt about using the Gemini ejection seats to abort from a malfunctioning booster.1 His answer exemplifies the sentiments of not only the astronauts, but also the designers and builders of that unique abort system. The rationale for that feeling will become apparent as this article is read. The proposal to use the ejection seats as the astronaut escape system for the two-man Gemini spacecraft was greeted with incredulity and skepticism. It was unimaginable that an ejection seat could safely propel an astronaut 1,000 feet—the initial guess—away from an exploding booster. Ejection seats were, of course, common in the jet fighters of that era, but none had the capability of safe ejection at supersonic velocities or at a zero altitude and velocity. Unimagineable or not, the task was initiated with the admonishment to find a way to make it work. For the authors, as part of the team assembled to accomplish this dubious task, it was one of most challenging assignments undertaken in their engineering careers.2 Mercury, the first manned U.S. spacecraft, was built by McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis, Missouri. It was a small one-man conical shaped vehicle that stood 9.5 feet high and had a 6-foot diameter base. With its 1,200-pound escape tower/motor system, it weighed 4,200 pounds. Two suborbital manned flights of 250 miles by astronauts Alan B. Shepard and Virgil I. Grissom during the summer of 1961 qualified all flight systems for orbital flight. Marine Lt. Col. John Glenn squeezed into a Mercury spacecraft he had named Friendship Seven, and accomplished the first U.S. orbital flight on February 20,1962. This flight lifted the spirits of all Americans distressed by the Soviet Union's large space flight lead. The Soviets had already twice orbited cosmonauts in their heavy 10,000-pound Vostok spacecraft. They were also well along in their development of the two-man Voskhod spacecraft, which would beat Gemini into orbit by six months. The effort involved in designing and testing the Mercury spacecraft was unique and pre sented engineering problems never before explored. Of these, man-rating the booster and providing an escape system to assure crew survival under all possible mishaps were the most crucial. The critical challenge was getting the crew away from an exploding booster just at liftoff. The Atlas missile booster, used for orbital flight, burned a mixture of hydrocarbons (kerosene) as a fuel called RP-1 with liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. The resulting fireball and blast wave was spectacularly violent, as proved by several Atlas boosters that had malfunctioned during development and testing. Mercury crew survival provisions consisted of an escape rocket mounted on a tower above the spacecraft. The escape rocket had three canted nozzles that directed the rocket exhaust away from the spacecraft. In the event of a booster malfunction, the spacecraft would be explosively separated from the booster and the escape rocket ignited to tow the spacecraft a safe distance away. A normal parachute deployment, water landing, and recovery by the U.S. Navy would follow. During a normal flight, the escape tower was jettisoned a few minutes into the flight when the blast wave danger had passed. The Mercury escape system was complicated by being completely automatic. This feature generated anxious moments several times during launch, when booster engine pressure spikes occurred that exceeded the threshold for triggering escape system initiation. Fortunately, they were of short duration, which prevented aborting from an otherwise normally operating booster.3 The massive weight of the tower/rocket motor, coupled with a complicated automatic system, spurred the search for a lighter and simpler system to be used in the follow-up two-man spacecraft first called Mercury Mark II. It shortly acquired the apt name of Gemini after the zodiac constellation, the Twins. The main objectives of Project Gemini were to develop rendezvous techniques and docking procedures. Design effort on Gemini was initiated in the spring of 1961.4 The Gemini spacecraft, only 20 percent larger than Mercury, was a tight fit for two persons.5 It was conically shaped like Mercury and stood 12.5 feet high with a base diameter of 7.5 feet. It had During World War II Robert V. Brulle flew seventy combat missions as a P—47 pilot, 366th Fighter Group, 390th Fighter Squadron. He earned BS and MS degrees in aeronautical engineering and had various aviation and space assignments as a university professor, research engineer, and project engineer. He retired from active duty in 1957 and then from the USAF Reserve as a lieutenant colonel in 1968. From 1957 to 1983, Mr. Brulle worked for McDonnell Douglas in missile aerodynamics and on projects Mercury and Gemini. He spends his time writing about his aviation and space experiences. Several of his articles have been published in various publications including Air Power History. Gordon P. Cress has been in the escape system field for more than thirty years and presently works for Lockheed Martin as team leader on the F-22 escape system. During his twenty-five years with Weber Aircraft, he participated in the design, development, test, and qualification of several major escape systems, and was a project test engineer on the Gemini Escape System. He published "The YF-22 Articulating Ejection Seat" in the Proceedings of the 1994 SAFE Association Symposium. 52 air power history / winter 1997</page><page sequence="4">WE WOULD DO OUR BEST TO PROVIDE A REASONABLE PROBABILITY OF CREW SURVIVAL ... BUT WE COULD NOT GUARANTEE SAFETY UNDER ALL CONDITIONS Figure 1. two conical sections called adapters attached to the base. One, the retro adapter, housed the retro rockets; the other, the equipment adapter, housed the extended orbit expendable supplies. Both adapters were jettisoned before reentry. Spacecraft launch weight was 8,400 pounds. A modified Titan II rocket launched Gemini into orbit. The Titan II used a hypergolic (self-igniting) fuel of UDMH2, a blend of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine, with nitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer. The catastrophic mixing of the fuel and oxidizer caused a rapid burning (deflagration), instead of an explosion. This created a less severe blast wave and fireball than that encountered with the Atlas fuel of RP\x=req-\ 1 and liquid oxygen. This supported the view that ejection seats were possible for crew escape, thus eliminating a weighty escape tower. Also proposed was the use of an inflatable controllable Ragallo wing, called a paraglider, for landing. It would deploy after reentry and allow the astronauts to land their spacecraft on retractable skids at an airport, rather than in the water. Ejection seats also provided a means of escape in event of a malfunctioning paraglider.6 It should be noted that the paraglider was dropped from consideration midway in the program due to development problems, and a Mercury-type parachute with a water landing was substituted.7 This article describes the struggle to design, develop, and qualify the Gemini crew ejection seats. It was a challenge that taxed our engineering talents and greatly advanced the state-of-the art in ejection seat design. Although the article is arranged in roughly chronological order of completion, the process was iterative, so all jobs were, more or less, worked on simultaneously. Crew safety was of paramount importance, but a realistic attitude pervaded both the corps of astronauts and the engineers: space flight was dangerous and casualties were bound to occur. Our philosophy was that we, as engineers, would do DURATION IN SECONDS our best to provide a reasonable probability of crew survival in a catastrophic occurrence, but we could not guarantee safety under all conditions. This philosophy remains in effect today. Ejection Seat Criteria The first challenge was to define the ejection seat criteria, that is, what the ejection seat had to do. We knew it had to propel the astronauts away from a malfunctioning booster, but how far and how fast, and to what flight altitude and velocity? Numerous studies were conducted to define those parameters and are narrated in this section. Booster Debris Avoidance Getting away from the booster debris caused by an in-flight malfunction was the first issue tackled, even as the debate raged between escape tower and ejection seat advocates. Tower advocates saw no solution to getting the ejection seats away from the debris pattern raining down from the point of malfunction. The debris pattern was postulated as an expanding cylindrical envelope lying in the plane of the trajectory, and was assumed to consist of debris of all sizes, shapes, and weights—all having different rates of fall. A postulated two-second time delay between booster malfunction and ejection exacerbated the problem since booster breakup would be above the ejected astronauts. It was initially postulated to have the Gemini astronauts launched into orbit oriented the same way as in Mercury, i.e., with the astronauts sitting upside down in the trajectory plane. This meant that if they ejected during launch phase they would remain in the plane of the booster trajectory and be within the falling debris field.8 The solution was a simple design change of turning Gemini 90 degrees on the booster so the astronauts would be inserted into orbit sitting sideways. The seat ejection would then be at nearly a right angle to the launch plane, hurtling the astronauts away from the debris plane. Thus, a simple design change eliminated the debris prob\x=req-\ lem.9 Ejection Accelerations Safe ejection accelerations were based on the human tolerance acceleration limits postulated by Dr. Mike Rickards, Weber Aircraft Co., and are shown in Figure l.10 This plot shows that the human body can withstand high accelerations, if their application time is short. It was understood that these limit accelerations were for human bodies restrained in perfectly contoured couches, and even then some injury was possible. The seat catapult and rocket motor thrust were tailored to follow very closely the parallel-positive (upward) acceleration limit of Figure 1. (A detailed discussion of the seat catapult and rocket motor is presented later.) Designing the seat to the human body limit accelerations was a design gamble, but was necessary to escape from an on-the-pad booster deflagration. air power history / winter 1997 53</page><page sequence="5">CALCULATIONS SHOWED THAT A BOOSTER MALFUNCTION ON THE LAUNCH PAD WOULD RESULT IN A FIREBALL 610 FEET IN DIAMETER A FREE FALL FROM HIGH ALTITUDE IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS UNDERTAKING Deflagration Fireball Getting away from a booster deflagration just at liftoff proved to be the design criteria for the ejection seat rocket motor. A deflagration fireball was established by extrapolating data of hyper\x=req-\ golic propellent reactions tested by the Naval Ordnance Laboratory.11 Calculations showed that a booster malfunction on the launch pad would result in a fireball 610 feet in diameter, which would have a radiant energy of 108 million BTUs, and last for 12 seconds.12 This design fireball led to the requirement that the seat rocket motor had to eject the astronaut to 400 feet from the booster at 3.5 seconds after ejection initiation. These figures were arrived at after many analyses and tests of astronaut reaction time, number and type of abort cues required, and iterations on types of failures that could occur. Parachute deployment would occur at 3.5 seconds, and being 400 feet from the fireball would prevent the deploying parachute from melting. This requirement led to the development of the largest rocket motor ever installed in an ejection seat. High Altitude Ejections High altitude supersonic ejections require the astronaut to wear survival and life support equipment. The astronaut must be encased in a pressure suit that can withstand an aerodynamic heating pulse of about 660° F at a Mach 3 ejection. He must also be provided with oxygen and be thermally protected to survive a free fall of about five minutes through a subzero temperature of minus 70° (-70° F). Those requirements were levied on the pressure suit provider. Ejections at high-altitude also require that the astronaut delay parachute deployment until he reaches a denser atmosphere, preferably below 15,000 feet. This is an absolute requirement as deploying a parachute at high altitude would, most likely, destroy the parachute and/or kill the astronaut from the opening shock. If he somehow survived the opening shock, he stood a good chance of freezing to death during the long, slow descent through the subzero temperatures. Figure 2. SEAT PERFORMANCE CAPABILITY 1 2 3 MACH NUMBER-Mn EJECTION CEILING (SECONDARY) RE-ENTRY 40f CEILING (PRIMARY) A free fall from high altitude is an extremely dangerous undertaking. In 1959, USAF Capt. Joseph W. Kittinger performed several high altitude jumps from a balloon ranging from 76,000 to 112,000 feet.13 The greatest hazard Kittinger encountered, during the long free fall, was getting into a back-first flat spin. This flat spin is violent enough to render a person unconscious, as happened to Kittinger on one of his first jumps. Fortunately, while he was still unconscious, the automatic reserve parachute deployed correctly at 10,000 feet. To prevent a flat spin, an astronaut must have a stabilization device that will keep him in an upright position so a flat spin cannot occur. Kittinger used a small stabilization parachute, but started his free fall from zero velocity. Some type of stabilization would have to be developed that could be safely deployed at Mach 3 and provide adequate stabilization throughout the long free fall. The stabilizer selected was the Goodyear Ballute. The design and testing of that device is covered later. Mach Number and Dynamic Pressure Mach number (Mn) and dynamic pressure (q) are both related to the flight velocity and are critical design parameters for computing ejection seat aerodynamic forces. Launch phase design values of Mn and q were determined by calculating the dispersion probability of the launch trajectory, and selecting the trajectories that provided the highest Mn and q envelopes. A tumbling spacecraft produced the highest Mn and q values for reentry. The selected design values are shown in Figure 2. During launch the ejection seats were the primary mode of escape (abort) up to 45,000 feet. Above that to 70,000 feet, a ride-it-out abort mode was primary and ejection seats secondary. The ride-it-out abort mode implied that the astronauts would remain in the spacecraft in event of a malfunction. They would manually shut down the booster engines, if applicable, and remain attached to the booster until it was safe to separate the spacecraft and land normally. The spacecraft provided excellent protection from an in flight fireball, small debris, and the hostile environment. The ride-it-out abort mode was instituted late in the program for several reasons, but primarily because engineers had no confidence in the space suit to provide adequate astronaut protection during a high-altitude, high-Mach number ejection.14 Analyses and Design Seat/Man Aerodynamics and Trajectories Ejection seat trajectories of all possible abort conditions were required; these would, in turn, define many other design parameters. Aerodynamic forces and moments for use in trajectory calculations were obtained from a series of wind tunnel tests of the seat/man configuration. These 54 AIR POWER history / WINTER 1997</page><page sequence="6">ENGINEERS HAD NO CONFIDENCE IN THE SPACE SUIT TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE ASTRONAUT PROTECTION DURING A HIGH-ALTITUDE, HIGH MACH NUMBER EJECTION (Far right) Figure 4. (Near right) Figure 3. spanned a range of Mach numbers from 0.5 to 3.5, and a complete range of angle of attack on all three axes. Additional limited angle of attack testing was conducted of the seat/man in proximity of the spacecraft and with a simulated seat rocket motor exhaust.15 This was the first set of seat/man aerodynamic data ever collected over a complete range of tumbling attitudes and supersonic Mach numbers. The ejection seat trajectory study utilized a six-degree-of-freedom computer program incorporating the full spectrum of aerodynamic data collected during the seat/man wind tunnel tests. Many variables had to be considered, such as initial ejection conditions of spacecraft altitude, velocity and rotational rates, seat/man weight, wind, variations in the seat rocket/catapult thrust, seat/man center of gravity (e.g.) location, and a host of others. The studies confirmed that getting away from the fireball was indeed the critical condition, and was most critical just at liftoff, denoted as an off-the-pad ejection. Ejection Rocket/Catapult Seat ejection employed a rocket/catapult (RoCat), which was mounted in the back along the vertical centerline of the seat and consisted of two distinct parts, the catapult and the rocket section. The catapult forced the seat, restrained on the rails by three sets of rail sliders, upward and off the guide rails. As the seat left the rails, the rocket was ignited, propelling the seat away from the spacecraft. Manufactured by Rocket Power, Inc., of Mesa, Arizona, the RoCat was the largest ejection seat rocket ever produced. The RoCat provided the attachment between the seat and the spacecraft, being mounted to the spacecraft at the bottom and providing the attachment to the seat structure at the top. The RoCat provided the required thrust to achieve a safe recovery trajectory, yet maintained accelerations that were within the limits of human tolerance shown in Figure 1. The initial catapult thrust created an onset rate of nearly 300 g's per second, based on a 15-per\x=req-\ centile seat/man weight of 370 pounds, and peaked at 20 g's.

(See Figure 3.) The rocket thrust had to counteract that initial forward tumble, yet not induce an appreciable backward tumble before the rocket burned out. The relationship between the rocket thrust axis to seat/man e.g. (referred to as thrust eccentricity) was a very critical and sensitive parameter, and required a detailed engineering analysis to arrive at the allowable eccentricity window. The allowable eccentricity window had a shield shape as shown in Figure 4. The area within the shield denotes the allowable eccentricity for safe off-the-pad ejections, defined in a pitch and lateral sense. Note that it allowed about 0.5 inch e.g. tolerance in both lateral and pitch eccentricities. The upper boundary was established by the requirement that the astronaut be 400 feet away from the Titan II booster at 3.5 seconds after ejection. That was when the parachute deployed, and a distance of 400 feet was needed to prevent the material from melting. The remaining boundary signified the points where the parachute was fully open and the astronaut was at a height of 75 feet and had decelerated to a velocity of 30 feet per second. The remaining 75 feet was allocated for decelerating to a safe 20 feet per second landing.

So critical was the ballasting that the e.g. change due to body and internal organ slump, caused by the ejection acceleration, had to be accounted for. It required that each astronaut have his own ballasted contour seat so the e.g. during ejection was within the acceptable window. A e.g. outside the window caused the seat to tumble, which reduced the ejection ground distance from the fireball. Numerous simulated ejections defined the entire operating envelope. Also computed were predicted trajectories for all the ejection tests to allow a comparison between the predicted and test trajectories. Figure 5 presents such a comparison for an off-the-pad ejection. It should be noted that before we reached that level of comparison we experienced many heartbreaks and disappointments. Some of our trials and tribulations are discussed later in the Ejection Seat Tests section. COMPUTED AND TEST EJECTION TRAJECTORIES Ballute The astronaut free fall stabilization device selected was the novel Goodyear Ballute (con tracted from balloon-parachute). It was essentially a drag balloon and had been under development by Goodyear for several years as a stabilization device for missile payloads.16 Inflated, it is shaped like a top. The Gemini Ballute had a diameter of 48 inches and a length of 54 inches. It was nylon coated with aluminum for protection against the high heat pulse. After the ejection seat rocket motor burns out, the astronaut is separated from the seat, and if at a high altitude, the Ballute is deployed. Spring loaded inlets allow ram air to inflate the Ballute, stabilizing the astronaut during the long fall. The Ballute system went through an extensive development and test program to get qualified. There were wind tunnel tests to measure the drag, stability, and deployment characteristics, and for structural qualification. Most of these tests were done in the 16 foot x 16 foot Supersonic Propulsion Wind Tunnel at the Arnold Engineering and Development Center, Tullahoma, Tennessee. There were free fall dummy drops from a C-130 aircraft at the Naval Parachute Facility at El Centro, California, and a long series of live jump tests from as high as 40,000 feet. Many problems arose that questioned the Ballute's suitability to perform its task, the most persistent being the deployment mechanism and its release. Nonstop test and retest, including live jumps, continued almost to the day of the first Gemini flight in March 1965 when it finally was qualified. Ejection Seat Design Weber Aircraft Company of Burbank, California, contracted with McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis to design, develop, manufacture, and qualify the ejection seat escape system for the Gemini spacecraft. McDonnell Aircraft (MAC) and Weber negotiated an unusual contractual arrangement; Weber would function as a division of MAC for this purpose using MAC procedures and drawing format. A cost plus fixed fee contract guaranteed Weber would recover all costs associated with the program and receive a specified fee. This permitted Weber to go ahead with development and testing on an expedited basis without having to get formal MAC approval for every change in task.17 Weber became a Gemini team member in April 1962, just after John Glenn's first Mercury orbital flight. By that time, preliminary calculations had determined that the ejection seat had to provide an astronaut recovery capability from ofF-the-pad to Mach 3 at 70,000 feet. It was indeed a daunting challenge even for state-of-the-art technology at that time. The seat design commenced with the configuration definition, size and shape of the seat, and coordinated that with the Gemini spacecraft and the hatch system. This involved not only the seat, but also included the design and configuration of the spacecraft supporting rails, the interfaces for the pyrotechnic initiation systems, the life support systems and the ejection hatch actu 56 AIR POWER history / WINTER 1997</page><page sequence="8">(Right) Uva jump luting it tha Naval Parachuta Facility at El Cantro, California.

It was a difficult design task to meet the weight goals and yet provide the required structural adequacy to withstand ultimate crash loads, landing impact loads, and ejection loads. The seat structure was primarily aluminum with some titanium, steel, and nonmetallic components. Two T-section rails in the spacecraft provided the support for the seat. Six sliders on the seat, three on each side, were the interfaces between the seat and spacecraft. Each astronaut sat on a hard-surface individually contoured seat, covered with a fire-resistant cloth. The seat bottom sur A front view of the backboard.

EACH ASTRONAUT SAT ON A HARD-SURFACE INDIVIDUALLY CONTOURED SEAT, COVERED WITH A FIRE\x=req-\ RESISTANT CLOTH face was the top of the emergency oxygen system for high-altitude ejection. The back surface was the forward face of the assembly called the backboard, which supported the Ballute, personnel parachute, and the survival kit. The survival kit was a hard pack with rigid sides that fit into the right-hand side of the backboard and nestled into the seat structure beside the center-mounted RoCat. The recovery parachute, a gun-deployed drogue chute configuration, was mounted on the left side of the backboard and nestled into the seat structure. The seat egresses from the Gemini spacecraft through a finite hatch opening. To ensure the astronauts were maintained within the hatch opening envelope, several features were incorporated. Foot stirrups provided the support and retention means for the feet. The boot heels fit directly into the simple tube structure at the lower front of the seat. This ensured that the feet and legs were protected from striking the hatch sill. They also helped to maintain the leg mass position during the critical slump period, and prevent leg flail injuries during high dynamic pressure ejections. Also provided were arm guards on each armrest. These were manually rotated up from their stowage position during the potential ejection phases of launch and reentry. They prevented the elbows from moving out laterally during catapult phase and possibly striking the hatch sill. As with the arm guards, the center-pull escape system ejection control ("D" ring) was out and ready for use only during a potential ejection scenario. The rest of the time it was folded down and out of the way in its compartment and protected by a sliding cover. Seat Ejection Seat ejection operation was very simple; just pull either seat ejection "D" ring to eject both seats automatically. The inertial reel automatically retracted the restraining straps, pulling the astronaut to the correct ejection posture, and the pyrotechnic sequencing system started by venting hot gas to the hatch actuators.18 The hatch actuators unlocked the spacecraft hatches, then opened them. When the hatch actuator reached full stroke and the hatch was fully open, hot gas ignited the seat rocket catapult, moving the seat up the rails. As the seat progressed up the rails, a lanyard was pulled to start the emergency oxygen system flowing. Another lanyard activated the pyrotechnic time delay for seat/man separa EJECTION SEAT SEQUENCING TIME (Sec.)

Separation was achieved by a pyrotechnic plunger located on the front seat structure. A nylon strap ran from the plunger under the oxygen system and behind the occupant's backboard to its attachment in the headrest structure. When the separator plunger stroked, it activated a mechanical system that released the lap belt and backboard from the seat. It then pulled the strap taut, separating the astronaut and his equipment from the seat structure. Figure 6 presents the ejection seat time sequence of these events. Above 7,500 feet, the Ballute is deployed for stabilizing the astronaut's free fall, and cut loose when descending through 7,500 feet. At 5,700 feet, the parachute deployment gun fired. After parachute deployment, the backboard and oxygen system are automatically discarded and the survival kit released and suspended below the astronaut with a line to his parachute harness. Ejection Seat Tests The seat test program spanned the entire spectrum, from individual parts through the subsystems, and finally the completely assembled ejection seat. The following section narrates the assembled seat program. It provides a glimpse of the trials and frustrations and the continued revisions required to develop the ejection seat. Recall that sophisticated computer simulations, which might today uncover such problems, were not available at that time; in fact, the main frame computer we used for calculations had less capability than today's small personal computer. We were also under a demanding pressure to get Gemini in orbit and to perfect space rendezvous so we could beat the Soviets to the moon. It may sound quixotic now, but we were enjoying every minute of the hectic work schedule. We felt patriotic and good about our work, and enthusiastic about meeting President Kennedy's challenge of putting a man on the moon in the decade of the 1960s. Pad Ejection Tests Completely assembled seat system development tests began in July 1962 with pad ejection tests conducted from the 150-foot tower at the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake, California. The first test of an off-the-pad abort condition could be termed a "learning experience." The extremely hot rocket exhaust gases destroyed the lower portion of the seat structure and the test dummy did not separate from the seat. This led to the incorporation of a nonmetallic flame bucket liner to protect the aluminum seat structure from the hot rocket exhaust, and a revision of the seat/man separation system. In the second test the seat/man separation worked correctly. Parachute deployment, however, was not achieved as the spring-loaded pilot chute drag was not adequate to deploy the tightly packed parachute. A gun-deployed parachute system was incorporated to achieve positive deployment of the canopy. Those first tests also revealed the extreme sensitivity of the rocket thrust/c.g. eccentricity, necessitating a man/seat center of gravity fixture to accurately determine the e.g. Such a fixture was designed and developed and used at the test and launch sites to establish the e.g. location. Additionally, the change in e.g., caused by the body and organ slump in response to ejection accelerations, was large enough to consider it in the e.g. calculation.19 The measurements and calculations allowed the e.g. to be placed at the optimum distance from the catapult centerline, and be within the thrust eccentricity window during ejection. This assured that the loads, accelerations, and onset rates would be within the human limits presented in Figure 1, and that the seat/man during rocket burn would be stable. The test program progressed with the seats ejected from a fixed open door boilerplate spacecraft and then a functioning hatch boilerplate spacecraft. Fifteen off-the-pad ejection tests were completed. An amusing incident occurred when astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell witnessed a test. Of course, the odds of having a major system malfunction at a test are directly proportional to the importance of the observers. This axiom was again proven true. During this twin ejection test, the systems were initiated as programmed. The left\x=req-\ hand seat egressed the vehicle as designed and the test dummy was successfully recovered by air power ^History / winter 1997 59</page><page sequence="11">THE TEST DUMMY WAS COCKED TO ONE SIDE WITH ITS HELMET ALL CRUSHED AND CRACKED YOU WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED IN TRADING SEATS, WOULD YOU? THE ASTRONAUTS SHOWED GREAT FOR\x=req-\ TITUDEAND HELD UP EJECTING, SAVING THE MISSION parachute down range. The right hand seat was another story. Hot gases generated by pyrotechnic devices drove the hatch actuators. As the hot gases expanded they drove the piston upward, unlatching the hatch and opening it out of the way of the seat path. When the hatch was fully opened, the hot gas in the actuator was vented off to ignite the catapult. The seat then moved up the rails and out of the vehicle past the locked-open hatch. The right hand hatch actuator suffered a malfunction of the o-ring around the piston. This leak allowed the hot gases to escape prematurely and ignite the catapult before the hatch was completely open. The seat smashed into the partially open hatch, jammed the headrest and the dummy's helmet into the hatch structure, and then jammed itself on the seat rails. The rocket-catapult was then essentially in a locked-shut firing condition, which it could not withstand, and exploded, incinerating the inside of the boilerplate (a welded steel mockup) spacecraft. Burned propellant permeated the whole area. The test dummy, in what was to be Lovell's seat, was cocked to one side with its helmet all crushed and cracked. After we looked at it for awhile, Lovell looked over at Borman and asked, "You wouldn't be interested in trading seats, would you?" Borman allowed as to how he was perfectly happy with where he was assigned and would stick with it. This incident resulted in a hatch actuator redesign and the use of redundant o-rings. Dynamic Ejection Tests Besides the pad ejection tests, six dynamic ejection tests were conducted on the Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Test Track facility at China Lake. These used a boilerplate Gemini spacecraft, a welded steel mock-up aerodynamically similar to the actual spacecraft, mounted on the rocket-powered test sled. Functioning seats and hatches were installed to test and qualify the entire system at high dynamic pressures. Again, the first sled test was a learning experience. This first test, conducted in November 1962, was just a dry run to gather aerodynamic data and verify the structural adequacy of the boilerplate spacecraft, sled, and pusher systems. It was decided to install two Gemini seats with test dummies in them to validate the operation and function of the telemetry systems, and record occupant accelerations and rotation rates in three axes. After all, it was just a dry run and what could possibly happen? The test was programmed to achieve a maximum velocity of 1,000 feet per second. Twelve Genie (air-to-air missile) rocket motors, configured in four rows of three motors, drove the sled. The last phase of the sequenced ignition of the motors involved the top center motor. When the top center motor ignited, the pusher sled suffered a structural failure. When the structure failed, the Genie motor came loose and crashed headlong into the aft end of the boilerplate spacecraft. It easily penetrated the 1/2 inch steel simulated heat shield and went right into the spacecraft, where it completely incinerated everything inside. This test resulted in the redesign of the pusher sled and no further incidents of this type were encountered. Dynamic sled tests finally got underway, with a refurbished boilerplate Gemini, in June 1963 with a dual ejection. The high dynamic pressure of these tests did uncovered some seat structural deficiencies that needed fixing. After a structural redesign and correcting several other system deficiencies, the sled ejection test program was successfully completed in December 1964 by test number 9.20 It demonstrated the entire ejection sequence and confirmed the structural design under the most severe conditions for which the seat system was designed. In-flight Tests Seat ejection tests were completed with three ejections from the back seat of an F-106B aircraft. One was a static firing of the system to confirm the compatibility between the Gemini ejection seat and the F—106B. The other two tests, conducted in January and February 1965, were full systems tests of production configured units. One test verified seat ejection at 15,000 feet at Mach 0.72. The other ejected at 40,000 feet at Mach 1.7. These tests successfully proved the high dynamic pressure and high-altitude, high\x=req-\ Mach number operation of the complete seat ejection system under flight conditions. Conclusions The ejection seat escape system was one of three Gemini systems that caused the most trouble in getting qualified, the other two being the fuel cells for electric power generation and the maneuvering thrusters. All systems finally yielded to the persistent engineering analysis, design, and tests to clear the Gemini system for flight. After two unmanned flights that qualified all flight systems, astronauts Virgil I. Grissom and John W. Young blasted off on March 23, 1965, completing three orbits and a precise landing in the primary recovery area. Eight more manned flights were completed. The ejection seats were never used. The closest they came to being used was on the Gemini 6 launch with astronauts Wally Schirra and Tom Stafford on board. The countdown had reached zero and the Titan II engines and mission clock had started. Suddenly, the engines cut off, leaving the Gemini spacecraft in a precarious position on top of a hot booster. Everyone was expecting the seats to come blasting out of the spacecraft, but the astronauts showed great fortitude and held up ejecting, saving the mission. The minor problem with the engine fuel system was corrected, and two days later the mission roared off the pad to perform the first rendezvous in space with the already orbiting Gemini 7 with Frank Borman and Jim Lovell on board. 60 air power history / winter 1997</page><page sequence="12">The seats were qualified, meaning all the systems would work. But no one could guarantee that the astronauts would come through the ejection unscathed, primarily because ejection created accelerations that were at the absolute limits of human tolerance, escape could be near an unpredictable fireball and in a hostile environment, and there was always the possibility of the unknown. Ejection was a calculated risk that the astronauts were willing to live with, but would use only as a last resort. The authors, as principal team members in bringing the ejection seats to fruition, agree wholeheartedly with Tom Stafford's statement quoted at the beginning of this article, and are as gratified as the astronauts that they never had to be used.21 ■ NOTES 1. Discussion with Tom Stafford at the Gemini reunion and memorial ground breaking in Titusville, Florida, July 1996. 2. The main proponent for using ejection seats was NASA's James A. Chamberlin, Chief, Engineering Division, Space Task Group. Jim Rose, Head of Mercury and Gemini Mission Planning, told us how he was tasked by Chamberlin to get an estimate of the fireball size of exploding Atlas and Titan missile boosters. Rose said he reviewed dozens of Air Force films and painstakingly measured the fireball size of the exploding boosters. This first quantitative fireball data was the basis for proposing ejection seats. (Conversation with Jim Rose at the Gemini memorial dedication, Titusville, Florida, July 1996.) 3. Ibid. 4.

The Gemini spacecraft was literally designed around astronaut Virgil (Gus) Grissom, the smallest astronaut, and to fit in the larger astronauts the seat and hatch had to be extensively modified. On the Shoulders of Titans, p. 220. 6. A land landing system was highly attractive because it eliminated the large Navy support needed to recover the astronauts from a water landing. 7. Although the Ragallo wing was not used, the development accomplished led to the now used very popular hang gliders. 8. The ejection seats were canted 12 degrees from the cockpit centerline (24 degrees between the two seats) and, therefore, would have had a negligible out-of-plane component when ejecting. 9. One of the authors, Bob Brulle, was instrumental in that design change, making his first contribution to the program success as related below. I had just been assigned to Mercury Mark II program at McDonnell, and was acquainting myself with the various engineering analyses in progress. While talking to the engineer doing the debris escape analysis, I casually suggested that Gemini be turned 90 degrees on the booster. He explained that the overriding objection to that proposal was that the astronauts would experience a side load, quite critical for a human, and thus could not withstand the launch accelerations. I convinced management that side loads felt by the astronauts would be minimal since the launch trajectory was very nearly a zero gravity flight path, so the astronauts would experience only the transverse (forward) booster acceleration. When the astronauts heard of this change they were also wary, and I was delegated to convince them that no appreciable launch side loads would be felt. Most astro nauts saw the correctness of the analysis, but I was not able to convince one. None of the astronauts who flew in Gemini ever complained of side loads. It's interesting to note that many people, including engineers and astronauts, did not grasp the concept of orbital mechanics at that embryonic space flight time period. 10.

As engineers, the authors were in constant touch and both sides were open and frank in discussing the numerous problems that arose. For the task at hand it was an excellent arrangement. 18. A pyrotechnic time delay device is essentially a powder train that takes a specified time to burn and then ignites the output charge. It is not unlike an old time dynamite fuse. A pyrotechnic time sequencing system is a series of pyrotechnic devices with built-in time delays that accomplishes a series of time related tasks. 19. A similar analysis determined the center of gravity change of the test anthropomorphic dummy slump characteristics under ejection accelerations. 20. Three of these tests did not involve ejections and were used to qualify the sled and spacecraft. 21.
