<plain_text><page sequence="1">JEAN PIAGET, PSYCHOLOGIST OF EPISTEMOLOGY A Discussion of Rotman's Jean Piaget: Psychologist of the Real JOHN RICHARDS ERNST VON GLASERSFELD Massachusetts Institute of Technology University of Georgia The challenging title of Brian Rotman's book neatly formulates the con- clusion the author draws from his investigation of some of Piaget's writings. Piaget, Rotman argues, is a realist. External reality is the constant, ever- present guide that leads Piaget to a progress-oriented, accretionist theory of evolution, cognition, knowledge, and finally, mathematics. Rotman brings out the deficiencies of the progress-oriented approach and applies them in his critique of Piaget. While we concur with Rotman's critique of progressivism and realism, we reject Rotman's notion that Piaget's theory is progressivist and realist. To take the second first, as Gruber and Voneche (1977, p. xxxvii) have pointed out, Piaget's fundamental work on the child's first two years of cognitive de- velopment is not called The Discovery ..., but The Construction of Reality in the Child. (Oddly, this work, a cornerstone in Piaget's theory, does not figure in Rotman's bibliography.) Whether reality is constructed or discov- ered has vast implications for all facets of a theory of knowledge. The former implies that the activity of coming to know the world is fundamen- tally creative and occurs repeatedly for each child. The latter implies a pas- sive "knowledge transfer" from a world in which things "are" into the child. For mathematics education the former implies that the child must actively construct its own foundation and its own mathematics, and it implies that mathematical communication can only be partially successful and at best suggestive. The latter implies that knowledge is already out there, com- pleted, and must somehow be inserted into the child. The one guides the child through its own activity of construction; the other requires a passive acceptance of what is ready-made. Rotman, however, shows only a passing interest in the act of construc- tion. He argues that, for Piaget, "the mind grows from a perpetual inter- action with its environment, modifying itself, and consequently what it takes to be the world, until it achieves a balance, a state of temporary equi- librium with reality" (Rotman, 1977, p. 18). The pursuit of this balance is what lies behind the progress of evolution, of cognition, and of mathe- matics. In each of these areas Piaget speaks of "vection" or "direction," but Rotman prefers "progress." In our judgment this is an irreconcilable altera- January 1980 29</page><page sequence="2">tion of the direction of Piaget's theory. It ignores the radical epistemological implications of Piaget's constructivism. Any claim of progress requires an end, a goal. In this case it is an ultimate claim, and it requires a final truth toward which we progress. Vection, or direction, indicates discernibly con- secutive change. This we may see, for instance, in the child's increasing ability to work with and understand number concepts. Thus we may speak of direction or change within a particular context, and from within that context it makes perfectly good sense to speak of progress. But that is quite distinct from progress in any ultimate sense or outside of any particular learning context. There is, as Rotman notes, a continuity in Piaget's investigations of di- verse fields: "Plainly behind Piaget's theory of cognition, evolution and mathematics the same model of change and development is at work" (p. 135). There is a gradual separation of form from content as we move from biological structures through psychological to mathematical structures. Rot- man's argument, which recurs throughout the book, is that, for Piaget, change and development are inevitable and directional. There is progress toward reality. This progression is exhibited in evolution, in psychology, and finally in knowledge-"the highest and most developed form of biolog- ical adaptation" (p. 62). Evolutionary change "is a directed inevitable lawlike process of increas- ing adaptation and equilibration" (p. 62). Psychological growth "has as its "telos' the growth to fixed adult norms" (p. 55). And scientific knowledge evolves toward complete objectivity, "a state reached when knowledge-a relation between the knower and the world-attains perfect equilibrium" (p. 23). The end, the telos, is knowable through mathematics, "a perfect form of knowledge, a perfect form of equilibrium between the knowing mind and the world, to be seen as the culmination of the unbroken evolu- tionary progression from protozoa to man" (p. 74). Piaget does indeed use a single model of change and development for each of these areas. But his model allows for, and in fact demands, the pos- sibility of alternative solutions to a single problem. This possibility of diver- sity is the essence of constructivism, and it is this aspect that makes Piaget's theories of such vast significance for any understanding of how it is that we do come to know-and how it is that we come to know mathematics in par- ticular. The individual can, and does, progress through the assimilation of, and accommodation to, more and more experience. The child's knowledge of mathematics progresses. But it is possible to speak of progress only be- cause the criteria are clearly delineated and certainly context-dependent. There is, however, no progress toward an unknowable unique reality. There is only discernible change. Evolutionary Change Since this claim of progress begins with a theory of evolution, it is here that we begin to respond to Rotman's charge. As Rotman explains, there is 30 Journal for Research in Mathematics Education</page><page sequence="3">a dialectic between opening (increasing the number and type of possibilities open to an organism) and integration (internal or structural adaptation re- sulting in morphological complexity). This dialectic is responsible for evo- lutionary growth. But Rotman understands this dialectic and the resulting growth to be progressive: "The two tendencies of opening and integration are the basic constituents of evolutionary progress, or 'vection', to use the less value-laden term that Piaget prefers" (p. 70). Piaget's choice of words here is important. "Vection," for Piaget, can be used in evolutionary con- texts, but "progress" is inappropriate. There are many ways in which an organism can survive, and, as Piaget notes (1967, p. 406--especially the top paragraph, which is omitted in the English translation), the plurality of surviving organisms is the best possible argument for this. "Adaptation" can occur in numerous ways. The term, however, is misleading by suggesting that specific changes result from spe- cific inputs. As argued in von Glasersfeld (1979), if an organism survives- individually or as a species-it means that, so far at least, it has been viable in the environment in which it happens to live. To survive, however, does not mean that the viable organism must in any sense reflect the character or the qualities of its environment. Those organisms that conflict with con- straints in the environment are eliminated. Survival is simply a matter of avoiding these constraints by any means. The environment is a sieve that eliminates organisms by presenting obstacles. We may call those organisms that make it through the sieve "adaptive," but that means no more than that they survived and are, therefore, viable. There are many holes in the sieve, many ways of slipping through them, and, consequently, many ways of achieving viability. Evolution has no memory. Progress is always for the moment. Piaget ex- plains: Progress in integration... is only concerned with the sort of integration that is, as it were, existing now, or synchronic, which means that it always has to be reconstituted in every new group without integrating the entire phyletic past as subsystems that are both conserved and overtaken. (1971b, p. 357) Evolutionary progress, in any ultimate sense, is foreign to Piaget's theory. This is explicit in a quotation Rotman takes from Piaget. Piaget argues that the early evolutionists wanted to speak of "progress" (the scare quotes are in Piaget) up to the human species: But they could not see clearly enough those objective elements which would have made it pos- sible to speak of vection or direction (in the mathematical sense of the word and with no sense of finality) and of the subjective or anthropomorphic values which confer upon this idea of vection a significance that is purely relative to human evaluations. (Piaget, 1971b, p. 122 as quoted in Rotman, 1977, p. 66) There are two points to glean from this quotation. First, vection or direction differs in important ways from progress. Progress is in terms of an end. Vec- tion or direction is commensurate with alternative directions and solutions to a problem. Piaget avoids any sense of finality and prefers to "avoid this January 1980 31</page><page sequence="4">ambiguous word 'progress' " (1971 b, p. 123). Second, if there is any signifi- cance to the vection or direction, it is only in terms of our human values. Progress, as such, could only be in terms of these criteria. It can never be ultimate. Progress is normative; vection indicates consecutive change. This distinction is essential to Piaget's theory. An organism does not evolve to solve future problems. Changes occur accidentally, and they may or may not bestow a selective advantage. Evolution is change, but the success is for the moment. Cognitive Change and the Growth of Knowledge Parallel to the dialectic between opening and integration is the dialectic between assimilation (integration of something new into existing schemata) and accommodation (adjusting existing structures and differentiating new schemata). This dialectic is responsible for cognitive growth. Integration in cognitive evolution, in contrast with biological evolution, is cumulative. On the individual (ontogenic) level these processes are directed by "a form of autoregulation or progressive equilibration" (Piaget, 1971b, p. 85). This growth in cognitive structures, as all development in Piaget's theory, is to- ward equilibrium. Rotman objects, however, that this cybernetic notion cannot carry over to cognition. Thus, while bodies are subject to disequilibria in automatic ways, in cognitive situations "the need to categorize and perceive the meaning of experience in order to be disequilibrated by it prevents any such automatic decision" (p. 104). Rotman's argument here presupposes that experience is indirect and is in some sense mediated. This is a misreading of Piaget and shows a basic misunderstanding of what Rotman calls Piaget's "Kantian connection." Rotman explains that for Piaget and for Kant, "raw experi- ence becomes knowledge only after it has been organized by the forms of intuition ... and the intellectual categories" (p. 149). And again, "raw expe- rience is always mediated by our concepts, it becomes knowledge only after it has been organized and structured first by our intuitions.., and then by our intellectual categories" (p.28). For Kant and for Piaget, something becomes raw experience by being acted upon. The organization and the knowledge are in the very act of ex- periencing. To experience is to already experience in space and time. The experience has categories by the act of perception. In these acts the organ- ism assumes regularities. The specification of such regularities is knowl- edge. If established regularities are disrupted, if there is a breakdown of the expected cycles, then the organism is in a state of disequilibrium (see Rich- ards &amp; von Glasersfeld, 1979). For Piaget, progressive equilibrium occurs in the individual and is not necessarily universal. But Rotman argues that for Piaget the stages of cogni- tive development in children "occur in the same order for all children past and present regardless of their social and historical milieu" (p. 60). Rotman 32 Journal for Research in Mathematics Education</page><page sequence="5">further extrapolates from this that the content of each stage must be univer- sal. In contrast, Piaget considers this an open question and calls for extensive comparative cross-cultural research. He is careful to note the limited nature of his conclusions: The psychology which we are developing in our milieus, characterized by a certain culture, a certain language, and so forth, remains essentially conjectural until we have furnished com- parative material for control purposes. (1971a, p. 69) Perhaps even more significantly, Piaget's claim of universality applies to the development of operations, not to their content; for example, it applies to the ability to construct invariants by means of compensation and revers- ibility, not to the particular invariants of number, area, and volume. This was pointed out by Rotman earlier, when he noted, "Necessity and inevita- bility are supplied by the process of change itself and are not to be found within the character of what is changed" (pp. 49-50). Rotman then argues that this universality arises from a developmental necessity, a necessity arising from the fact that knowledge is structure, structure is transformation, and transformations occur in relatively stable self-regulating systems that achieve their stability only by being in accord with the laws of increasing equilibrium. (p. 60) But knowledge is not simply structure-it is structure maintained invariant in spite of changing circumstances; it is the result of functional adaptation. It is functional in that it serves an end successfully. And it is adaptation in the sense argued earlier: There are innumerable ways in which viability can be achieved. The end of this functional adaptation is equilibrium. As with an organ- ism, knowledge is viable or it is not. Disequilibration occurs when a cogni- tive structure applied to experience no longer leads to the intended result or upsets the functioning of another applied cognitive structure. It is always a description of the state of the system, not of the relation of the system to something external. Hence equilibrium is not a relation of the system to the world; and knowledge is not, as argued by Rotman, a relation between the knower and the world. This is not Piaget's position. As had been noted by Rotman earlier, "The idea that the mind passively records data or receives knowledge is, Piaget argues, contrary to all that biology tells us of the rela- tion between the organism and its environment" (p. 26). The biological function of knowledge is not to represent in any way ontological reality but rather to enable the cognizing organism to maintain the equilibrium that is its (the organism's) constitutive character. The organism is not concerned with what is. It is concerned only and exclusively with what perturbs its continuity. Mathematical Growth Rotman's argument for progress in Piaget turns finally to mathematics- January 1980 33</page><page sequence="6">the culmination of the evolutionary progress that began in protozoa and continued in humans. This final stage of the argument rests primarily on the claim that, for Piaget, mathematics is totally autonomous. Rotman rejects Piaget's mathematics because it "ignores the central role that proof plays in mathematics" (p. 141) and because it results in the omission of large por- tions of mathematics. But Rotman misrepresents the autonomy thesis. Piaget's claim is not that mathematics is totally independent from all societal and cultural influences. As Piaget argues, the autonomy of an individual mathematician is his or her independence from personal or emotional factors. The role of psychological factors on the inrdividual level is analogous to the role of sociological factors on the cultural level. Whether it is a question of men in society or the individual subject, we need to distinguish (a) the operational structures of actions and (b) the subjective states which accompany them. (Beth &amp; Piaget, 1966, p. 244) The development of operational structures is independent of cultural and sociological influences in the subjective sense. But the interaction of the in- dividual and society is an essential part of the development of new struc- tures. It is thus evident that logico-mathematical operations are from childhood onwards at once collective and individual owing to an unavoidable circularity ... if educational factors acceler- ate the child's operational development, he must use operations to assimilate those transmitted to him, which brings us back to the circularity of the individual and the collective. (Beth &amp; Piaget, 1966, p. 245) Mathematics results from an autonomous development of the operational structures. The history of the particular structures is essential to the present and future development of these structures. Rotman, however, attacks the complete autonomous development of mathematics. This isolated development omits any need for justification and communication. There is no need for proof in such a development. The central error of Piaget's structuralism is the belief that it is possible to explain the origin and nature of mathematics independently of the nonstructural justificatory questions of how mathematical assertions are validated. (p. 144) Rotman states that for Piaget, proofs "become mere checks or verifications that the descriptions are in fact correct" (p. 145). This results, Rotman ar- gues, in Piaget's confusing "the discovery and invention of structure with the making and proving of assertions about structure" (p. 143). But this is not the case at all. For Piaget, as for Lakatos (1976), for ex- ample, proofs are part of a dialectic. For Piaget this is what produces adult logic and serves to differentiate adult logic from the logic of the child. As early as 1928 Piaget argues: What then gives rise to the need for verification? Surely it must be the shock of our thought coming into contact with that of others, which produces doubt and the desire to prove. ... The social need to share the thought of others and to communicate our own with success is at the root of our need for verification. Proof is the outcome of argument. (1928/1976, p. 204) 34 Journal for Research in Mathematics Education</page><page sequence="7">Piaget's deliberations here show clearly the extent of Rotman's misstate- ment of the autonomy thesis. While it is necessary to eliminate subjective, personal, emotional factors from the development of mathematics, there is nevertheless an interaction of operational structures. This interaction is what produces, and distinguishes, communicated intelligence. Indeed, the whole exposition is framed in view of the proof, i.e., in view of the necessity of convincing someone else, and (as a corollary) of convincing oneself whenever one's personal certainty may have been shaken by the process of deductive reasoning. (Piaget, 1923/1974, p. 66) But Rotman argues that for Piaget there is no need to introduce proof; "its place is taken by appeals to necessity, and the mathematician knows when an assertion is true by the certainty associated with it" (p. 148). Instead, proof plays an essential role for Piaget, as it should for any astute observer of mathematics. Moreover, it is through the vehicle of proof that the subtle interplay between the individual and the collective produces mathematics. It is precisely to the extent that verbal-conceptual thought is transformed by its collective nature that it becomes capable of proof and search for truth, in contradistinction to the practi- cal character of the acts of sensorimotor intelligence and their search for success or satisfac- tion. It is by cooperation with another person that the mind arrives at verifying judgments, verification implying a presentation or an exchange and having in itself no meaning as regards individual activity. Whether conceptual thought is rational because it is social or vice versa, the interdependence of the search for truth and of socialization seems to us undeniable. (Pia- get, 1954, pp. 406-407) Verification, or for mathematics, proof, arises when there is doubt, either individual or collective. This is a direct result of Clapar6de's law of con- sciousness. Rotman concludes that mathematics is for Piaget a form of perfection, "the culmination of adaptation to reality, the most perfect instance of bio- logical knowledge whose congruity with the real is absolute" (p. 171). But the passage from Piaget, from which Rotman purports to derive that state- ment, does not speak of "congruity with the real"; instead it says, "Man cannot understand the universe except through logic and mathematics, the product of his own mind" (Piaget, 1971a, p. 118, as quoted in Rotman, 1977, p. 171). Conclusion For Piaget there is no ultimate progress, and there is no "congruity" of knowledge and reality. There is adaptation, but adaptation means that there are viable organisms and that there are viable theories. The change from adaptation to viability is a challenge to the unargued premise of Rotman's work-that Piaget is a psychologist of the real. From his neo-Kantian perch Piaget is ontologically neutral, uncommitted. The noumena, the Ding an sich, reality in some absolute sense, lie beyond the sphere of experimental justification. Piaget is not a realist, for each individual constructs his own reality. In January 1980 35</page><page sequence="8">contrast with the title of Rotman's book, Piaget is not a psychologist of the real but of the concept of the real. What he has studied for almost 70 years is not reality but the construction of reality. When he reports his findings, when he explicates his theory, however, he is compelled to use more or less ordinary language-and ordinary language is, of course, rife with the onto- logical implications of naive realism. Nevertheless, we believe that he has made his position quite clear. To Rotman's assertion that he is a "psycholo- gist of the real" he responds, "Je m'en fous de la r6alit6" (as quoted in Gru- ber &amp; Voneche, 1977, p. xxii). REFERENCES Beth, E.
