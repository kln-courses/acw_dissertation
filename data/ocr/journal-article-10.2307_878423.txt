<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LITERATURE OF ART Vishnu's Flaming Wheel: The Icono- graphy of the SudarBana-Cakra. By W. E. Begley. xiv + Io6 pp. with 6 figs., + 8o black-and-white plates. (New York University Press for College Arts Association of America), o10.65. The Sudariana-Cakra in the title of this book is the 'wheel-beauteous-to-behold' wielded by the Epic hero Krishna on the battlefield as the formidable symbol of his invincibility. This symbol can be associ- ated, in the period before the assimilation of Krishna with Vishnu, not only with an early cult of Vasudeva-Krishna but also with the Vedic deity Vishnu. It thus becomes linked with an underlying stratum of solar symbolism and that of the wheel regarded as a weapon which sur- rounds the complex character of Vishnu. Of this vast amount of amorphous material the author has chosen to confine himself to a restricted field concerning the personification of the sudar.ana-cakra and deal with it in some detail. The book is divided into two parts: the first contains a brief historical survey of the references to the wheel (cakra) as a weapon and sym- bol in Vedic, Puranic and Tantric literary sources, while the second part traces the development of the icono- graphy of the symbol in Indian art (mostly sculpture) from about 200 B.c. to the eighteenth century. The progress of the cakra through the texts from being simply a weapon to be- coming a symbol and then personified as a deity in its own right is varied and intricate. In the Vedas, the activities of Vishnu are linked to those of Indra but, apparently, without any close association between Vishnu and the cakra as a weapon. If logicality or consistency in these texts is expected or looked for this might seem surprising in view of Vishnu's later con- nexion with the cakra as his most distinctive weapon and symbol of his prowess as a warrior - a role which, incidentally, he gradually took over from Indra. In the literature of the intervening period, be- tween the Rig-Veda and the Epics, there is little evidence of any clear development in this direction. Instead, the position of the cakra seems to have been treated ambiguously. Almost predictably, how- ever, in the Rig-Veda and in the Epics, there arose the phenomenon which must be found in all societies, the personification of the cakra as a weapon and the bestowal on it of special names. This was part of a general trend in which warriors were ad- vised to worship their weapons and treat them with particular awe. From here it was a short but inevitable step towards an anthropomorphic conception of the cakra as a deity. This seems to have taken place at the time when some of the Epics were adapted for theatrical performance. During the later Puranic period (about 6oo-Iooo A.D.) a parallel development seems to have evolved which emphasized the symbolism of all Vishnu's weapons. Thus, his cakra was invested with an elaborate symbolism that equated it with air, mind and the wheel of time and through this to astrology and the cycle of the seasons. Later still, possibly through the influence of Tantrism, in texts such as the Ahirbudhnya-Samhitd the Sudariana- cakra becomes fully anthropomorphic. He is given several arms, is made the centre of elaborate esoteric rites and, by the thirteenth century, he has attracted his own body of literature. The author picks his way judiciously through the enormous mass of related literature and provides a summary, admirably backed with evi- dence in the form of quotations (often with their Sanskrit original in Romanized form), of the emergence of Sudariana-cakra as a deity. As one might expect, his representation in the form of sculpture did not arise until comparatively late, that is to say at about the time he was described anthropomor- phically in the texts. Before then, however, there is substantial evidence of the per- sonification of the cakra (cakra-purusha) as an attendant figure in icons where he stands on Vishnu's (proper) left with a personified gada on Vishnu's right. These are found from the early fifth century on- wards in a wide area including Kashmir, Mysore, Rajasthan and Bihar. They appear to be placid beings who reflect Vishnu's benevolent nature. In contrast, later, medieval figures of the Sudariana- purusha corresponding to the tantric en- vironment of which the Ahirbudhnya- Samhitd was a product, were multi-armed and had a terrifying aspect. This ap- pearance is latent in the earliest South Indian image of Sudarsana which is in late C61la style and dates probably from about the thirteenth century. While similar, earlier images have not yet been found it is clearly the precursor of later types which fall roughly into two main groups. The majority, not surprisingly, are surrounded by their cakra symbol which frequently has flames springing from its circumference and may enclose a sat-kona to complete the background. In one group the deity appears to be in motion (this includes the earliest figure already men- tioned above); in the other group the deity stands perfectly straight in a static posture. The usual number of arms is sixteen but it may be eight. In addition there are other variations having four or six arms, or with sixteen arms but with five heads and riding on a Garuda. Evi- dently, once the movement towards diversity that was encouraged by Tant- rism had begun the possibilities were al- most endless though they are not dealt with in this book. If the r61e of the art historian is to understand the objects with which he is involved, instead of a sterile attribution of date and provenance, more books like this one are needed. Even the author would agree that there remains much that we do not know about SudarSana-cakra. But our understanding of it has been consider- ably increased by this account of its de- velopment from a weapon to an important icon, at the same time enlarging our knowledge of early Indian religious thought. The book contains an excellent glossary and bibliography but its usefulness would have been enormously improved if it had been provided with an index. JOHN LOWRY</page></plain_text>
