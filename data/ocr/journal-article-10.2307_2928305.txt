It must be a literature that abandons, or at least questions, what would seem to be literature's most basic foci: character, persona, narrative consciousness. What literature could survive under these conditions? - Lawrence Buell, The Environmental Imagina- tion The 1992 National Book Award for fiction given to All the Pretty Horses brought Cormac McCarthy his first widespread recognition as a writer of importance. Throughout most of his career, which began in the mid-1960s, McCarthy had worked and published in obscurity. Promotional campaigns meant little to him; he refused the interviews, personal appearances, and academic sinecures that might have made his name more widely known sooner. And for many years his readership was limited to a small group of admirers mostly from the South. All the Pretty Horses helped change all that, but it is not McCarthy's most noteworthy book. That honor belongs to Blood Me- ridian or the Evening Redness in the West (1985), which, like All the Pretty Horses, might be called a "Western." Both novels trace the adven- tures of teenaged boys who run away to Mexico, but Blood Meridian American Literature, Volume 68, Number 2, June 1996. Copyright C) 1996 by Duke University Press. CCC 0002-9831/96/$1.50.</page><page sequence="2">434 American Literature is only very loosely centered around the character identified to the reader simply as "the kid." Its opening pages offer a summary of the kid's early life in the Tennessee hills, his flight to Texas in 1848, and his recruitment by a troop of filibusters, most of whom are slaughtered by a force of Comanches as their expedition makes its way into Mexico. The kid then joins up with Captain John Joel Glanton's band of scalp hunters, who have a contract to provide the Mexicans with the hair of Apache raiders preying on isolated borderland villages and towns. Glanton and his men begin their own bloody campaign of depreda- tions, which lasts for a year or two and several hundred pages. The kid is one of the few survivors of this campaign. The last chapters of the novel offer a compressed account of the final twenty-eight years of his life of wandering, and of his eventual death in an outhouse at the hands of his old comrade-in-arms, the seven-foot tall three-hundred pound hairless albino Judge Holden, a man of incredible savagery and great intellectual facility. All these events are described in prose remarkable for its syntactic complexity, its recondite vocabulary, its recording of minute detail, and its violent intensity, as well as for an uncanny, almost scriptural stateliness. Blood Meridian is a very complicated book-although complication is not a quality often associated with the label Western. Early reviewers attempting to map this novel's outlandish aesthetic and moral territo- ries resorted to striking but desperate oppositions. To them, the novel seemed a blend of Hieronymus Bosch and Sam Peckinpah; of Salvador Dali, Shakespeare, and the Bible; of Faulkner and Fellini; of Gustave Dore, Louis L'Amour, Dante, and Goya; of cowboys and nothingness; of Texas and Vietnam.1 These oppositions, because they were produced by readers still under the novel's spell, evoke rather than interpret it. To do the latter has proven extremely difficult. McCarthy's work seems designed to elude interpretation, especially interpretation that would translate it into some supposedly more essential language. The few readers who have given Blood Meridian deliberate and prolonged consideration have generally fallen into two camps, which (simply to make their differences clear) can be distinguished geo- graphically. "Southern" readers have tended to see McCarthy as the heir of William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor. Given the Appa- lachian settings and country-folk characters of The Orchard Keeper (1965), Outer Dark (1968), Child of God (1973), and Suttree (1979), and given McCarthy's Faulkner-like verbal range and the O'Connor-like</page><page sequence="3">History and Blood Meridian 435 grimness of his humor, seeing him as a Southern writer in the great tradition is not unreasonable. It is nevertheless a mistake, particularly with regard to Blood Meridian, and not just because the sources and setting of this novel are more Western than Southern. Those who read McCarthy as a "Southern" writer tend to want to find in each of his novels something redemptive or regenerative, something affirm- ing mysteries similar to those O'Connor's fiction is supposed to affirm (mysteries of a Christian or Gnostic variety). McCarthy's fiction re- sembles O'Connor's in its violence, but he entirely lacks O'Connor's penchant for theology and the jury-rigged, symbolic plot resolutions that make theology seem plausible. In McCarthy's work, violence tends to be just that; it is not a sign or symbol of something else. There is, moreover, an astonishing amount of it: the body count for Blood Meridian alone runs into the hundreds. The "Southern" camp there- fore wants to defend McCarthy from the heinous charge of nihilism, to make him seem more like O'Connor than he really is.2 "Western" readers see in the trajectory of McCarthy's career a move toward wider relevance and a broader worldview. For these readers, Blood Meridian marks McCarthy's progress toward address- ing not just the Wild West but Western culture as a whole, especially its philosophical heritage. According to the "Western" camp, McCarthy's antecedents are not only great American writers like Faulkner and O'Connor or Melville and Hemingway, but figures from world litera- ture as well-specifically Dostoevski (the judge adopts a sidekick known as "the idiot") and Conrad (especially Heart of Darkness), less specifically Nietzsche and Heidegger.3 McCarthy's "nihilism" is not, therefore, something he must counter by crafting a symbolic redemp- tion of the fallen world or narrating the moral regeneration of his characters. On the contrary, it is just what one would expect from a writer who has fed on such corrosive, demystifying influences. But the provenance of Blood Meridian is still difficult to specify; fit- tingly for a work set in a borderland, it seems curiously suspended, not just between regions and geographies, but within literary history. It is a difficult text to periodize. Obviously, given its publication date (1985), it was written after the heyday of high modernism-in fact, at a time when the failure of modernism had been thoroughly assimilated as a working philosophical assumption of contemporary literature. Yet it avoids the apocalyptic tone and the jaded manner of much postmodern fiction (the novels of Thomas Pynchon or Don DeLillo, for example) .4</page><page sequence="4">436 American Literature McCarthy's allegiance to either the modernist or postmodernist paradigm, or to the "Southern" or the "Western" camp, is doubtful. He has always been unforthcoming about his intentions, but has admitted the following: "The ugly fact is that books are made out of books. The novel depends for its life on the novels that have been written."5 While this statement may not seem particularly revealing, it does offer clues to understanding McCarthy's novel. What books, then, has Blood Me- ridian been "made out of"? McCarthy acknowledges that the novel is partially constructed out of his research in Mexican and Ameri- can records detailing the bloody exploits of Captain Glanton and his band of scalp hunters (including the historical figure Judge Holden) in the years following the Mexican-American War.6 Knowing that Glan- ton and other members of his band are not pure fictions may excite some readers. I doubt, however, that this knowledge offers any real hermeneutic advantage. What distinguishes Blood Meridian from the many other works of fiction which also retell the true history of the American West-to be specific, from another contemporary novel in which Glanton and his men also appear, George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman and the Redskins? Fraser's novel is so very "historical" that he provides detailed notes describing the sources on which his fiction is allegedly based.7 Flashman and the Redskins is an elaborate pastiche of historical "research," adventure, and sexual farce; in it, Glanton and his band appear broadly comic. Blood Meridian also makes de- tailed use of Glanton's history, but it is not an elaborate jape, nor is it a tour de force. And it is not a pastiche of its sources; it does not, in the postmodern manner, hollow out a space in other texts in order to comment ironically on the cultural fabric they form. It does not much resemble other contemporary novels constructed from similar historical sources. Thomas Berger's Little Big Man, to cite a second example, is overtly moral in tone and somewhat sentimentally favors the "savage" side of its protagonist Jack Crabb's character. (Crabb has been raised as a white man and as a Cheyenne, and claims to be the sole white survivor of the battle of the Little Big Horn.) A third work of historical fiction set in the American West, the definitively postmodern Silver Light by film critic David Thomson, borrows characters from classic Western films like Red River and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, treats them as historical figures, and interweaves their lives with those of fictional residents of the present-day Southwest, some of whom are said to be the blood descendants of Matthew Garth, Liberty</page><page sequence="5">History and Blood Meridian 437 Valance, and other "historical" figures of popular culture.8 McCarthy does not have Thomson's archness; and the story of Captain Glanton and his men is not well enough known to qualify as an insider's joke for Western history buffs. McCarthy can neither "allude" to it, as a modernist might, nor can he incorporate it into the fabric of a fictional pastiche in order to riff on it in the postmodern manner. An awareness of John Joel Glanton's history is therefore little help in sorting out McCarthy's "philosophy of composition."9 This concept is developed by Lukaics in his 1936 essay "Narrate or Describe?" and although his theories are overly prescriptive, they enable us to charac- terize McCarthy's book as a historical novel-to place Blood Meridian in terms of period and genre and to begin to properly "historicize" it. However, historicizing it will not mean coming to see Blood Me- ridian as cozily embedded in a particular context which determines its themes, its content, and its style; the novel strongly resists such pigeonholing. If, as McCarthy has said, the novel is "made out of" both his own historical research (which included learning Spanish) and out of "the novels that have been written," its relationship to its context cannot be a simple one. We must consider the complex relationship between its apparent "philosophy of composition" and its implied phi- losophy of history. "Compositional principles of a poetic work," Lukatcs writes, "are a manifestation of an author's view of life." 10 The remain- der of this essay will explore Blood Meridian's point of view. I will try to show, however, that this is not necessarily the same thing as the "author's view of life," and to describe, finally, how Blood Meridian is related to McCarthy's other work, especially the more recent novels of his "Border Trilogy." Narration versus Description Lukaics argues that novelists should narrate and not merely describe events. Narration, from his Marxist-humanist perspective, involves the articulation of the ways in which individual characters relate to the events they witness and to the social, cultural, and political contexts in which those events occur. Description involves unflagging atten- tion to objective details and little more. Description as a "philosophy of composition" is deplored by Lukaics because it seems to entail the abandonment of a sense of human values and of an active human re- lationship to the world: "Representation declines into genre.... One</page><page sequence="6">438 American Literature state of mind at any moment and of itself without relation to man's activity is as important or as irrelevant as another. And this equiva- lence is even more blatant when it comes to objects." The decline of "representation" into "genre" results, according to Lukacs, in the rise of debased forms of popular literature in which narrative complexity and insight have withered away. Lukaics has in mind subliterary forms like the detective story; we might, in the present context, think of the Western.11 The descriptive novel (that is, the "naturalist" novel) attempts no statement of an ideology; Lukatcs insists that "without ideology there is no composition." "Ideology" for the early Lukaics means historical awareness. Without historical awareness, description fixates on the merely material; this fixation "transforms the novel into a kaleidoscopic chaos."12 To some, "kaleidoscopic chaos" might seem an accurate character- ization of Blood Meridian. McCarthy's novel does not attempt to en- gage history, to explore the psyches of the characters and explain the meaning of the events it describes in the explicit, consciously critical way that Lukaics requires. What does this say about McCarthy's "phi- losophy of composition"? To answer this question, it helps to be aware of Blood Meridian's use of Moby-Dick. As a number of readers have noted, Blood Meridian bears some resemblance to Melville's novel. Moby-Dick seems to have provided McCarthy with some of his novel's language; for example, his hint about "the awful darkness inside the world" echoes Melville's "the blackness of darkness."13 Philosophi- cally, however, McCarthy is much more assured than Melville that there is a "darkness inside the world"-and less disturbed by it. For McCarthy, it's just darkness. The desert floor is literally a "hollow ground" across which Glanton and his band ride, where they can hear "the dull boom of rock falling somewhere far below them in the awful darkness inside the world," in the literal darkness of a deeply buried cave or fault in the earth.14 In Blood Meridian darkness is not a "theme," a dire metaphysical possibility mad characters can urge upon saner men, but a reiterated fact. As a place of literal darkness, the Mexican desert is a proving ground, as McCarthy puts it early in the novel, "to try whether the stuff of creation may be shaped to man's will" (5). This also sounds Melvillean, but McCarthy does not go on to portray the tragic down- fall of characters guilty of cosmic presumption. Whereas Melville was anxious to record his horror of darkness by having his characters re-</page><page sequence="7">History and Blood Meridian 439 act to it, Blood Meridian treats darkness, violence, sudden death, and all other calamities as natural occurrences-like the weather, which can also be vicious in McCarthy's border landscapes. Accordingly, the novel soon makes it clear that creation cannot be shaped to man's will, at least not for very long. Man's will does not seem a very relevant or potent force in this novel, nor does there seem to be some other will shaping his fate: Far out on the desert to the north dustspouts rose wobbling and au- gered the earth and some said they'd heard of pilgrims borne aloft like dervishes in those mindless coils to be dropped broken and bleeding upon the desert again and there perhaps to watch the thing that had destroyed them lurch onward like some drunken djinn and resolve itself once more into the elements from which it sprang. Out of that whirlwind no voice spoke and the pilgrim lying in his bro- ken bones may cry out and in his anguish he may rage, but rage at what? And if the dried and blackened shell of him is found among the sands by travelers to come yet who can discover the engine of his ruin? (111) Nature here is no longer symbolic of some greater fatality that engi- neers the novel's events, but it is nonetheless deadly. Because his "philosophy of composition" is not the same as Mel- ville's, McCarthy's novel realizes some of the unfulfilled potential of Moby-Dick. Melville had begun to suspect that violence and death (as opposed, say, to liberty and justice) defined American history. That is why the bloody business of whaling, and not something more be- nign like the spread of railroads or the "annex" of new territories (which were, of course, only relatively benign), stands as his metaphor for American capitalist and imperial aspirations. For McCarthy, what Melville only suspected has been confirmed, as one of the epigraphs to Blood Meridian suggests: "Clark, who led last year's expedition to the Afar region of northern Ethiopia, and UC Berkeley colleague Tim D. White, also said that a re-examination of a 300,000-year-old fos- sil skull found in the same region earlier shows evidence of having been scalped.""5 Violence and death, it would seem, are the more or less objective truths of all human experience. The novel's implied insistence on the failure in the mid-nineteenth century (and in the mid-1980s, too) of the human desire for utopia, as we might read it, calls into question the very concept of "history,"</page><page sequence="8">440 American Literature tied as it is to notions of progress, of the social evolution of human consciousness. "Save for their guns and buckles and a few pieces of metal in the harness of the animals," nothing about Glanton's men, McCarthy writes, suggests "even the discovery of the wheel" (232). Given its apparent rejection of history as a meaningful category, we must conclude that Blood Meridian is not "historical" according to the criteria developed by Lukacs, although it does incorporate the husk of a historical romance, not just the husk of Moby-Dick but that of the Western as well-perhaps of all the Westerns "that have been written." Other aspects of the historical novel also go by the board in Blood Meridian. Character may be the most important of these. Lukatcs ar- gues that the dramatic representation of character is necessary if an author wishes to explore the ideological complexities of a given era: "An artist achieves significance and typicality in his characterization only when he successfully exposes the multifarious interrelationships between the character traits of his heroes and the objective general problems of the age and when he shows his characters directly grap- pling with the most abstract issues of the time as their own personal and vital problems." In this connection, we might recall how Lukacs, in The Historical Novel, praises Sir Walter Scott's heroes and (more pertinent here) Cooper's Leatherstocking-that first of all Western heroes-for their awareness of historical conflict and its determin- ing effect on their lives: "Cooper's greatest artistic achievement is his singular development of Scott's 'middle-of-the-road hero. "'16 The characters in McCarthy's novel resemble not those of Waverly or The Deerslayer but those of Moby-Dick. The likeness of "the kid" to Ishmael, of Captain Glanton and the judge to Ahab, and of Glan- ton's band to the Pequod's motley crew is fairly obvious. But Blood Meridian's echoes of Melville's text also help make clear their dif- ferences. The rhetorical excess of Moby-Dick's attempts to represent character may have suggested to McCarthy the possibility of rewriting character as something else-character not as self but as language, as a suggestive artifact or trace of the human, like the Anasazi potshards Judge Holden collects. Character in Blood Meridian is something writ- ten, something "made out of" the shards of characters McCarthy dis- covers in the middens of history, literary and otherwise. "The kid," for example, is a remarkably reduced version of Ishmael. Ishmael's fondness for the "furious trope" is partly responsible for the constant swing in Moby-Dick from idiom to idiom and, indeed, from genre to</page><page sequence="9">History and Blood Meridian 441 genre, as Ishmael interrupts his narrative with parodic, grotesque byplay (Father Mapple's sermon, Queequeg's Ramadan), thumbnail sketches of maritime law, moralistic natural history essays, rhetorical flights of fancy, dumb puns and dirty jokes, imitation Shakespearean tragedy, and other writerly indulgences. With the possible exception of the judge's speeches, there is nothing comparable to Ishmael's furi- ous troping in McCarthy's book."7 Indeed, the kid spits as often as he speaks. It would not really be accurate, therefore, to call him the main "character" in Blood Meridian, since McCarthy seems to have largely dispensed with the concept of character in fashioning his material. "All history" may be present in the kid's face (3), but this does not make him a "world-historical individual" with the sort of "dramatic charac- ter" Lukatcs admires.18 It is the kid's "taste for mindless violence" that marks his face, and makes it historically significant (3); "history" is not a form of awareness in McCarthy's novel but merely the arena in which brutal, "mindless" events transpire. Judge Holden appears to be an exception to the rule defining char- acter in Blood Meridian: he is loquacious, even multilingual, and an intellectual with a great store of both practical and arcane informa- tion. His voice seems to be in implicit dialogue with the impersonal, highly detailed, and verbally ingenious narration. But it is a mistake (one that many readers find easy to make because the judge is such a remarkable creation) to regard his speeches as representative of his character. Because they are first and foremost literary performances, the sum of his speeches does not equal a whole person. They are de- livered as highly ironic and playful lectures; the judge never misses an "opportunity to ventilate himself" (240). For example, during a confrontation in the desert after most of Glanton's band has been mas- sacred, the judge tries to persuade two other survivors (the kid and the ex-priest Tobin) to join him: "They lay under the boardlike hide of a dead ox and listened to the judge calling to them. He called out points of jurisprudence, he cited cases. He expounded upon the laws pertaining to property rights in beasts mansuete and he quoted from cases of attainder insofar as he reckoned them germane to the corrup- tion of blood in the prior and felonious owners of the horses now dead among the bones. Then he spoke of other things" (293). The judge's speeches are more than lawyerly in their expansiveness: they are also nihilistic. But his is a thoroughly rhetorical, somewhat ersatz nihilism, and the judge offers it up with relish, suggesting that what Melville</page><page sequence="10">442 American Literature found so alarming (that behind the facade of the brute, material world there might be something indifferent or malevolent-or nothing at all) McCarthy can retail as if it were just another and quite familiar chapter in the annals of thought (which, after all, it is). The judge's "nihilism," very much on display in the following speech, is an intellectual artifact from a time long past, and thus no cause for alarm: If God meant to intefere in the degeneracy of mankind would he not have done so by now? Wolves cull themselves, man. What other creature could? And is the race of man not more predacious yet? The way of the world is to bloom and to flower and die but in the affairs of men there is no waning and the noon of his expression signals the onset of night. His spirit is exhausted at the peak of his achievement. His meridian is at once his darkening and the evening of his day. He loves games? Let him play for stakes. (146) Although many of his speeches, like this one, are nihilistic compounds of Nietzschean (and Spenglerian) rhetoric, the judge is not a nihilist (nor a Spenglerian). That his "character" has no real-world analogue and is not intended to suggest one is made apparent several times.19 Consider, for example, the quandary of the young boy who offers Judge Holden his choice of two puppies for sale: "The boy looked at one and then the other of the animals. As if he'd pick one to suit the judge's character, such dogs existing somewhere perhaps" (192). Or consider the judge as he appears in a fevered dream the kid has while recovering from an arrow wound: "A great shambling mutant, silent and serene. Whatever his antecedents he was something wholly other than their sum, nor was there system by which to divide him back into his origins for he would not go" (309). There was, McCarthy writes, "no trace of any ultimate atavistic egg by which to commence his reckoning" (310). No calculus, moral or otherwise, will explain the judge. Having dispensed with "character" as a hermeneutic concept, one cannot then latch onto the judge's speeches as authorial pronounce- ments. Holden is not a ventriloquist's dummy perched on the novelist's knee, and we should not strain our eyes to see whether McCarthy's lips move when the judge speaks. He is not sounding the novel's "themes."20 By dispensing with character as a concept, McCarthy is able to deploy the language he uses heuristically as a tool for explor- ing the liminal concerns the novel takes up, such as whether human</page><page sequence="11">History and Blood Meridian 443 beings have any privileged position in relation to the rest of the world. Thus traditional concepts of the narrator as a "person" or "voice," a sort of meta-character with an interest in certain "themes" that help to structure a text, also do not apply to Blood Meridian. The novel's narration is omniscient, but there seems to be no knower providing us with the knowledge it imparts. And this knowledge does not really develop; it merely accrues. The most often repeated sen- tence in Blood Meridian is "They rode on." So the plot moves, but it does not thicken. Because all the novel's complexities are fully present from the first page, it can scarcely be said to have been "composed" at all in the Lukaicsian sense. The novel does not seek to resolve "con- flicts" which trouble its characters, much less its narrator or author. It is not really a narrative, then, but a description-and some would say it is not really a novel either. "Optical Democracy" As a book which describes rather than narrates its events, Blood Me- ridian constructs a remarkably consistent, philosophically rigorous, and somewhat uncanny point of view (a misleading metaphor, really, as I try to show below). From this point of view, persons are not privileged as subjects, just as Lukaics says must be the case when novelistic repre- sentation is abandoned.2" Blood Meridian has been called "a critique of our culture's anthropocentrism."22 In it, the human does not stand out among the other beings and objects that make up the world. The ques- tion of human spiritual animation-of the human being's status as a subject, as a special kind of object set apart in the landscape of ordinary objects, when it arises at all (the book's critique of anthropocentrism is almost entirely implicit) is a rhetorical one, perhaps designed to tweak our readerly nostalgia for novels (Westerns most especially) in which men were men and the landscape was something else: In the neuter austerity of that terrain all phenomena were be- queathed a strange equality and no one thing nor spider nor stone nor blade of grass could put forth claim to precedence. The very clarity of these articles belied their familiarity, for the eye predicates the whole on some feature or part and here was nothing more lumi- nous than another and nothing more enshadowed and in the optical democracy of such landscapes all preference is made whimsical and a man and a rock become endowed with unguessed kinships. (247)</page><page sequence="12">444 American Literature In its insistence on "optical democracy," on the equality of being be- tween human and nonhuman objects, this passage, like many others in Blood Meridian, realizes a possibility with which Westerns (films and novels) have long flirted. Jane Tompkins has argued that "the genius of the Western" is that "it seems to make the land speak for itself." But in the Western, if the land speaks "for itself," it also speaks to the hero, who figures as the focal point in any landscape he enters. Tompkins makes this clear in her description of the role of landscape in Louis L'Amour's novels: The hero's passage across the landscape has ultimately a domes- ticating effect. Though it begins in anxious movement and passes through terror and pain, it continually ends in repose. A welcom- ing grove of aspens, a spring, and a patch of grass provide shelter and sustenance. A campfire and the setting sun give visual pleasure and comfort, while trickling water and a horse cropping grass make soothing noises. If nature's wildness and hardness test his strength and will and intelligence, they also give him solace and refreshment. Perhaps more than anything, nature gives the hero a sense of himself.23 But L'Amour's landscapes are perfunctory: his descriptions name only a few representative features of the land (mesa, butte, skyline) and its flora and fauna (greasewood, aspens, quail, Gila monsters). In his many novels, the West is a generic place where a windburned saddle- tramp rides Old Paint through a paint-by-numbers landscape, grunting with satisfaction at its familiarity. Blood Meridian, a novel in which none of the protagonists has any- thing remotely like "a sense of himself," is a Western without a hero (and thus, some would say, not really a Western at all). In it the land "speaks for itself"-perhaps it would be more accurate to say it "acts for itself"-in a much more thorough-going and less medi- ated fashion than traditional Western formulas permit. Compared to McCarthy's, L'Amour's landscapes seem hopelessly naive. Potent land- scapes inform all of McCarthy's work, from The Orchard Keeper, his first novel, to Suttree and Blood Meridian, helping to shape the best- selling and supposedly more humane All the Pretty Horses. In all these texts, McCarthy describes terrain of which we are ordinarily only fleet- ingly aware, a landscape that looms in the background of the opening frames of many movie Westerns and through which many a literary</page><page sequence="13">History and Blood Meridian 445 cowboy has ridden. But as McCarthy shows, this landscape is capable of more than looming. This landscape is, then, both familiar and unfamiliar. Having seen it only piecemeal before, in Blood Meridian we are shown both its largest and smallest features, "even to the uttermost granulation of reality" (247). It is as if the real American West were being imagined for the first time; imagined, that is, as terribly and finally real: They rode in a narrow enfilade along a trail strewn with the dry round turds of goats and they rode with their faces averted from the rock wall and the bake-oven air which it rebated, the slant black shapes of the mounted men stenciled across the stone with a defi- nition austere and implacable like shapes capable of violating their covenant with the flesh that authored them and continuing autono- mous across the naked rock without reference to sun or man or god. (139) If any one of the things described in this passage seems more potent, more animate, than another, it is not Glanton's men but the shadows they cast. The suggested independence of light and dark reinforces the lack of precedence, of referential order, in the natural world and helps make apparent the "unguessed kinships" between objects as di- verse as goat turds, the sun, men, and gods. This kinship, however, neither ennobles the turds nor debases the gods but merely makes them equal in that both are putatively factual. The same "optical democracy" (247) characterizes a scene in which the scalp hunters take refuge in a stable on a cold night: one by one they began to divest themselves of their outer clothes, the hide slickers and raw wool serapes and vests, and one by one they propagated about themselves a great crackling of sparks and each man was seen to wear a shroud of palest fire. Their arms aloft pulling at their clothes were luminous and each obscure soul was enveloped in audible shapes of light as if it had always been so. The mare at the far end of the stable snorted and shied at this luminosity in beings so endarkened and the little horse turned and hid his face in the web of his dam's flank. (222) Here "obscure souls" are "enveloped in audible shapes of light," but there is no contradiction because the phenomenon of static electricity is a natural one. Familiar assumptions about character or "soul" are</page><page sequence="14">446 American Literature always treated by McCarthy as hypotheses ("as if it had always been so") and are made to seem dubious at best. In this scene, the horses seem more animate, perhaps even more conscious than Glanton's men. Of course, horses are more sensitive than men to some things, especially to things in the natural world, and they often get the last word in McCarthy's fiction (this passage concludes a chapter). These apparent paradoxes are not the only ones in McCarthy's book. Less obviously he also confounds the categories of narration and description, the purity of which Lukaics himself describes as illu- sory: "What is important . . . are philosophies of composition, not any illusory 'pure' phenomenon of narration or description." Lukaics's categories of narration and description rewrite the vulgar Marxist dis- tinction between material base and ideological superstructure in lit- erary terms. His own favorite novelists (Scott, Balzac, and Tolstoy, among others) figure in his essay as heroes of consciousness because of their ability to articulate an ideology in their novels. Ironically for a materialist, Lukacs has least admiration for those novelists (Zola especially, but also Flaubert) in whose works the material world is given attention more or less for its own sake: "A 'poetry of things' independent of people and of people's lives does not exist in litera- ture." But McCarthy's philosophy of composition ignores the distinc- tion Luk'acs makes between description and narration. Description "debases characters to the level of inanimate objects" only if one as- sumes that characters occupy a higher level than objects in the first place; otherwise they cannot be seen as "debased."24 Thus Vereen Bell's treatment of McCarthy's style does not recognize how radically unanthropocentric it is: "the human beings constitute one protagonist and the natural world another. Narrative and description collaborate with each other in conventional ways, but what is ultimately important is that, even ontologically, they compete."25 My argument is that this competition has been decided in favor of description and the natural world even before Blood Meridian begins. For McCarthy, description and the natural world as categories contain both narrative and human beings. Human beings and the natural world do not figure as antago- nists-Blood Meridian does not have that kind of dramatic structure. They are instead parts of the same continuum and are consistently described by McCarthy as such. If a grizzly bear eats one of Glanton's Delaware scouts or a wild bull gores one of their horses, it is business as usual as far as the scalp hunters are concerned. They ride on.</page><page sequence="15">History and Blood Meridian 447 Blood Meridian does not grant Luk'acs's humanist premise about novelistic representation. There is no supernatural elevation of con- sciousness, no "poetry of people," so to speak, in it. Moreover, this lack arises as an issue only occasionally in the speeches of Glanton's men, whose attempts at interpreting the events they witness are soon enough revealed as limited, provisional, and quite naive, as the judge likes to point out: "Your heart's desire is to be told some mystery. The mystery is that there is no mystery" (252). Blood Meridian's uni- verse is a natural one, even when its landscapes are simultaneously earthly and unearthly. At such moments the universe is described as a continuum, a more or less even distribution of existence throughout a radically unbounded space: "The stars burned with a lidless fixity and they drew nearer in the night until toward dawn he was stum- bling among the whinstones of the uttermost ridge to heaven, a barren range of rock so enfolded in that gaudy house that stars lay awash at his feet and migratory spalls of burning matter crossed constantly about him on their chartless reckonings" (213). The limits of perspec- tive are left behind in a passage like this one: it is cosmic without being metaphysical, as if the sentence had been written by a transpar- ent eyeball that has learned how not to be Emersonian. It suggests, to paraphrase Melville, an "ungodly, godlike" view of life. In this sense, it is true that McCarthy's "descriptive method lacks humanity," as Lukaics would say.26 It is precisely its lack of human implication that some find Blood Me- ridian's most disturbing feature. In the raw orchestration of the book's events, the world of nature and the world of men are parts of the same world, and both are equally violent and indifferent to the other. In one scene a man dies when a pitcher of aguardiente is poured over his head and ignited by a cigar: "The man ran outside mute save for the whoosh of the flames and the flames were pale blue and then invisible in the sunlight and he fought them in the street like a man beset with bees or madness and then he fell over in the road and burned up. By the time they got to him with a bucket of water he had blackened and shriveled in the mud like an enormous spider" (268). Human failure to be other than brutal is not treated here as a departure from the ordinary course of events. It is just another event. This is true as well of the failure of the natural world to take into account human feelings. In another important scene, in which the kid and his companion SDroule lie wounded (Sproule's arm is gangrenous</page><page sequence="16">448 American Literature and maggot-ridden) and asleep on the desert sands, a huge bat attacks Sproule: they slept like dogs in the sand and had been sleeping so when something black flapped up out of the night ground and perched on Sproule's chest. Fine fingerbones stayed the leather wings with which it steadied as it walked upon him. A wrinkled pug face, small and vicious, bare lips crimped in a horrible smile and teeth pale blue in the starlight. It leaned to him. It crafted in his neck two narrow grooves and folding its wings over him it began to drink his blood. (65-66) We have learned before this gruesome scene, in one of the book's choicest exchanges of dialogue, why the unfortunate Sproule has come out West: He was coughing again. He held his chest with his good hand and sat as if he'd get his breath. What have you got, a cold? I got consumption. Consumption? He nodded. I come out here for my health. The kid looked at him. He shook his head and rose and walked off across the plaza towards the church. There were buzzards squatting among the old carved wooden corbels and he picked up a stone and squailed it at them but they never moved. (58) Salvation history, which understands the natural world and man's tra- vails in it as symbols of the spirit, has long since been played out, as the ruined, eroded, and buzzard-draped mission churches in Blood Meridian suggest. Only natural history, which regards neither nature nor man as symbolic, is left. It seems newly potent as a result. Nevertheless, McCarthy is not writing what Lukacs dismisses as a "poetry of things." Vereen Bell points out that the world in McCarthy's novel is "mysterious enough without involving ideas," but I doubt that he intends this remark to imply that McCarthy's work contains the sort of mystery that Flannery O'Connor deliberately injected into hers. In his chapter on Blood Meridian, Bell suggests that McCarthy's style "seems to move us toward an epiphany, though only the kind that a seasoned gnostic might construe."27 I take this as a warning to sea- soned gnostics everywhere. Neither the history of the American West</page><page sequence="17">History and Blood Meridian 449 nor natural history is put forward in Blood Meridian as the last ves- tige of the mysterious or lyrical. Natural history makes the provisional quality of all human interpretations of events-poetic ones perhaps most especially-painfully apparent. This is why Judge Holden, for all his willful solipsism and despite his casual attitude toward murder, is described as a good dancer and boon companion: "He bows to the fiddlers and sashays backwards and throws back his head and laughs deep in his throat and he is a great favorite, the judge" (335). Nothing in nature prevents him being both a murderer and the life of the party. The speech of McCarthy's protagonists (perhaps his own as well) is no longer, then, an index of characterological or personal traits, the instrument with which to divine some hidden and occult order in the world, but simply a historical and literary artifact. For that reason, it is available to the writer without regard for psychological or moral or political propriety of the sort that worried Lukaics. Once psychology, morality, and politics come to be seen as mere languages, propriety becomes a highly relative question, even an uninteresting one. At any rate, Blood Meridian certainly cannot be read as suggesting some moral insight on the order of "scalp hunting is wrong." Nor does it try to adumbrate a more sophisticated, more political version of that insight, something on the order of "scalp hunting is imperialism by other means." McCarthy's language has a strange equanimity of tone, strange be- cause of the virtuousity with which it details what seems unspeakable and what once it has been spoken requires no further comment: Now driving in a wild frieze of headlong horses with eyes walled and teeth cropped and naked riders with clusters of arrows clenched in their jaws and their shields winking in the dust and up the far side of the ruined ranks in a piping of boneflutes and dropping down off the sides of their mounts with one heel hung in the withers strap and their short bows flexing beneath the outstretched necks of the ponies until they had circled the company and cut their ranks in two and then rising up again like funhouse figures, some with nightmare faces painted on their breasts, riding down the unhorsed Saxons and spearing and clubbing them and leaping from their mounts with knives and running about on the ground with a peculiar bandy- legged trot like creatures driven to alien forms of locomotion and stripping the clothes from the dead and seizing them up by the hair and passing their blades about the skulls of the living and the dead</page><page sequence="18">450 American Literature alike and snatching aloft the bloody wigs and hacking and chopping at the naked bodies, ripping off limbs, heads, gutting the strange white torsos and holding up great handfuls of viscera, genitals, some of the savages so slathered up with gore they might have rolled in it like dogs and some who fell upon the dying and sodomized them with loud cries to their fellows.... Dust stanched the wet and naked heads of the scalped who with the fringe of hair below their wounds and tonsured to the bone now lay like maimed and naked monks in the bloodslaked dust and everywhere the dying groaned and gibbered and horses lay screaming. (53-54) No explanation of this event is necessary. Moreover, McCarthy's use of vivid similes (such as the dead "lay like maimed and naked monks in the bloodslaked dust") does not give the event a symbolic dimension. On the contrary, the similes seem designed to increase the intensity and accuracy of focus on the objects being described rather than to suggest that they have double natures or bear hidden meanings.28 Con- sider also his description of a survivor sitting amid the ruins of an ambushed camp of Tigua Indians: "All about her the dead lay with their peeled skulls like polyps bluely wet or luminescent melons cool- ing on some mesa of the moon.... [I]n in the circuit of few suns all trace of the destruction of these people would be erased. The desert wind would salt their ruins and there would be nothing, nor ghost nor scribe, to tell to any pilgrim in his passing how it was that people had lived in this place and in this place died" (174). Whatever the language Blood Meridian offers us (monks, polyps, or melons), it is meant not to evoke a symbolic netherworld but to describe to the "pilgrim in his passing" the salt ruins of humanity.29 Not Forms, But Forces It is perhaps for this reason that McCarthy approaches the ugly fact of violence in such a detached, almost forensic manner, as he does, for example, when he reconstructs a shootout in a cantina in the Mexican village of Nacori: "There were twenty-eight Mexicans inside the tavern and eight more in the street including the five the expriest had shot" (180). A different, less clinical approach would seem anthropomorphic or all too human. But Blood Meridian is not so much inhuman as non- human. It is thoroughly dispassionate. The book's odd power derives</page><page sequence="19">History and Blood Meridian 451 from its treating everything and everybody with absolute equanimity; its voice seems profoundly alien, but not alienated. With imperturb- able calm, it speaks the words of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century narratives and the masterworks it rewrites (Melville, but Dostoevski, Conrad, Hemingway, and Faulkner, too), as well as the words of natural history and material history. (McCarthy describes equine accoutre- ment, antique tools, and hardware, most especially guns, in remark- able detail.) It speaks "Mexican." It draws upon the occult and other esoteric matters. It conflates the Old Testament with the Western. It does all this as if these many texts, discourses, foreign tongues, disci- plines, scriptures, and literatures all formed a single language. Which they do, at least in this book.30 The concatenation of these discourses suggests a "purview," some- thing Charles Newman argues postmodern fiction cannot offer: "We live in a time when no purview is possible.""3 But the purview of Blood Meridian is not a source of comfort, nor is it empowering, as New- man imagines such a perspective of totality must be. Its only rule is the relativity of force. All forms (presumably, even its own) are merely provisional, heuristic devices. McCarthy's purview is visionary, but not in the usual sense of that term.32 It is literally visionary, and what it sees is an "optical democracy" in which "all preference is made whimsical" (247). McCarthy's purview is also complicated in relation to its time, which Newman cites as the chief factor delimiting the possibility of purview. On its surface Blood Meridian does not seem to be very much of its time, at least not in any limiting sense. One might even say that it is "premodern," in that it seems to have adopted the purview of the epic. Lukaics describes the epic world as follows: "There is not yet any in- teriority, for there is not yet any exterior, any 'otherness' for the soul. The soul goes out to seek adventure; it lives through adventures, but it does not know the real torment of seeking and the real danger of find- ing; such a soul never stakes itself; it does not yet know that it can lose itself, it never thinks of having to look for itself. Such an age is the age of epic." Some of this passage might also serve as a description of the kid's adventures in Blood Meridian. But if it were merely a question of McCarthy's having simulated the epic worldview "by purely formal means," as Lukaics puts it, "after the transcendental conditions for its existence have already been condemned by the historico-philosophical dialectic," then Blood Meridian might indeed be dismissed as a tour</page><page sequence="20">452 American Literature de force. But I would argue that the epic and natural history-that is, the descriptive or "earth" sciences such as geology, meteorology, astronomy, archaeology, evolutionary biology, and paleontology-are similar ways of viewing the world. Both the epic and natural history are concerned (albeit in importantly different ways) "with reality as it is" and with the "concept of life," which Lukacs says "has no need of any ... transcendence captured and held immobile as an object."33 It is Blood Meridian's adherence in its descriptions of events to the pro- tocols and paradigms of natural history that gives it epic resonance. The present world as McCarthy describes it is an ancient world not of myth but of rock and stone and those life forms that can endure the daily cataclysms of heat and cold and hunger, that can weather the everday round of random, chaotic violence. Only the "great temporal limitation imposed by geology upon human importance," an aware- ness of "deep time," can give this world spatial and intellectual order.34 For that reason, the American West in McCarthy's fiction is not the New World but a very old world, the reality of which is bedrock. We might periodize him with some confidence, then, as a writer not of the "modern" or "postmodern" eras but of the Holocene, with a strong historical interest in the late Pleistocene and even earlier epochs. What the virtual absence of Lukacsian narration in his book seems to say about McCarthy's moral or political worldview is bound to be disturbing to readers who (somewhat datedly) expect novels to offer an imaginary solution to individual or social ills. Lukacs writes that "the novel form is, like no other, an expression of... transcendental home- lessness." Bakhtin makes a strikingly similar claim: "The novel begins by presuming a verbal and semantic decentering of the ideological world, a certain linguistic homelessness of literary consciousness."35 Blood Meridian, in contrast to most novels and most popular Westerns, accepts homelessness as its inevitable condition. It does not express an aspiration for domesticity and repose-for a home on the range. The favored discourses of the novel-religion, ethics, psychology, and politics-suffer the fate of most other humanist discourses when the anthropocentric point of view is abandoned. So does nihilism. Philosophically, nihilism was a response to religion, ethics, psychology, and politics: Nietzsche, in The Genealogy of Morals, exposed the limita- tions of the language by means of which religious, ethical, psychologi- cal, and political discourses attempt simultaneously to capture human essences and to obscure their own institutional interests in power,</page><page sequence="21">History and Blood Meridian 453 and he thus revealed each of these discourses as radically relative. Blood Meridian hints at a descriptive discourse which might capture within its net religion, ethics, psychology, politics, and nihilism too, a discourse which limns the outlines of the arena in which humans- priests, jurists, therapists, kings, and philosophers-contend without any vested interest in the outcome. McCarthy's distance from his sub- jects is in this respect remarkable: "Above all else they appeared wholly at venture, primal, provisional, devoid of order. Like beings provoked out of the absolute rock and set nameless and at no remove from their own loomings to wander ravenous and doomed and mute as gorgons shambling the brutal wastes of Gondwanaland in a time before nomen- clature was and each was all" (172). Such passages do not assert the meaninglessness or utter fragmentation of existence or experience as given. Rather, they suggest meaning on a scale of time and space which we can only dimly perceive, marked by the scraping of rock upon rock (in the case of the ancient megacontinent Gondwanaland, very old and very large rocks). The meaning of these scrapings is not connected to human value. Blood Meridian does not wholly reject the notion of value, but the values it describes are not ones for which we have ready terms. For McCarthy, the history of the West is natural history. This is a history of forces, and the processes by which these forces evolve into the forms to which we give names are not our own. Thus the present is also "a time before nomenclature" (172). "In history there are no control groups." Blood Meridian ends with an epilogue that to some readers seems problematic-more so, that is, than the book's preceding three hun- dred and thirty-five pages. It appears to be a parable of sorts, in which a solitary man with a pair of post-hole diggers progresses across the West Texas plains "striking the fire out of the rock which God has put there" as he makes holes for a new fence line: On the plain behind him are the wanderers in search of bones and those who do not search and they move haltingly in the light like mechanisms whose movements are monitored with escapement and pallet so that they appear restrained by a prudence or reflectiveness which has no inner reality and they cross in their progress one by one that track of holes that runs to the rim of the visible ground and which seems less the</page><page sequence="22">454 American Literature pursuit of some continuance than the verification of a principle, a vali- dation of sequence and causality as if each round and perfect hole owed its existence to the one before it there on that prairie upon which are the bones and the gatherers of bones and those who do not gather (337) It seems to me that this passage does not offer anything new. Rather, it confirms what the preceding chapters have consistently shown: the action here also has "no inner reality." It is "the verification of a principle" of which the actors themselves may not be at all aware, given their clock-like movements and given that the principle itself is only hypothetical, only a matter of "as if." What is vouchsafed here, however, is a vision of the more contemporary world that informs McCarthy's next novel, All the Pretty Horses: a world in which the Western plains have been rationalized-settled, fenced, and punctured not by post-hole diggers but by oil wells, which also strike fire out of the rock in accord with the dictates of an ideology of progress. Thus the epilogue to Blood Meridian begins to return us (but only be- gins) to the familiar terrain of religion, ethics, psychology, and politics. All the Pretty Horses, the first volume of the "Border Trilogy," is set in a recognizably novelistic world. It does have a main character, John Grady Cole (another teenaged boy), and it addresses the history of the American West (in particular, of the Texas-Mexico border country) in a way that might have satisfied even Lukacs. It is also a much more ge- nial text than Blood Meridian. But McCarthy has warned that its gentle character may be just "a snare and a delusion. " 36 Blood Meridian fulfills a logic at work in all of McCarthy's work, and the violence described on every page of that book is by no means absent in All the Pretty Horses. John Grady Cole is beaten, stabbed, and shot; he beats, stabs, and shoots at others. And in a scene reminiscent of Judge Holden's extemporizing, he is lectured on the meaning of history by the Duenia Alfonsa, who witnessed first-hand the Mexican revolution: When I was in school I studied biology. I learned that in making their experiments scientists will take some group-bacteria, mice, people -and subject that group to certain conditions. They compare the results with a second group which has not been disturbed. This second group is called the control group. It is the control group which enables the scientist to gauge the effect of his experiment. To judge the significance of what has occurred. In history there are no control groups. There is no one to tell us what might have been. We</page><page sequence="23">History and Blood Meridian 455 weep over the might have been, but there is no might have been. There never was. Thus despite its greater emphasis on the dramatic representation of its characters, All the Pretty Horses gravitates toward the worldview of Blood Meridian. Both novels resist the comforts of the "might have been," and both insist that, as the Duenia Alfonsa puts it, the true is not "what is righteous but merely what is so." So much, then, for history. With regard to the future, McCarthy promises in the last line of All the Pretty Horses a journey into "the darkening land, the world to come."37 This journey will also be a return.38 University of Pennsylvania Notes 1 See Alan Cheuse, USA Today, 8 March 1985, D3; Bill Baines, Western American Literature 21 (spring 1986): 59-60; Caryn James, "Is Everybody Dead Around Here?"

Fred Hobson does not discuss McCarthy at any length, but his book The Southern Writer in the Postmodern World (Athens: Univ. of Georgia Press, 1991) attempts to explore some of the historical limitations of the idea of "the southern writer" in a way that avoids some of the pitfalls of regionalism. Hobson's interest in postmod- ernism (although insufficiently theorized) and his sense that McCarthy's fiction "is often set ... in a world of pure concreteness and is often, by intent, devoid of any informing point of view at all" (81) anticipate some of my concerns in the present essay. 3 See chapter 5, "The Metaphysics of Violence," of Vereen M. Bell's The Achievement of Cormac McCarthy (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State Univ. Press, 1988), 116-35. See also Steven Shaviro's essay on McCarthy (which I discuss at some length, and cite in note 4) and the review by John Lewis Longley Jr., "The Nuclear Winter of Cormac McCarthy," The Virginia Quarterly Review 62 (autumn 1986): 746-50.</page><page sequence="24">456 American Literature 4 McCarthy may be writing in the aftermath of literary modernism, but that does not make Blood Meridian postmodernist, as Steven Shaviro has suggested. Shaviro reads Blood Meridian as an allegory of poststruc- turalist, postmodern theory (specifically, of Deleuze and Guattari's Anti- Oedipus andA Thousand Plateaus); he describes McCarthy as a "nomadic wanderer, lucid cartographer of an inescapable delirium." And Shaviro contends that "Blood Meridian rejects organicist metaphors of growth and decay, in favor of an open topography (what Deleuze and Guattari call 'smooth space') in which the endless, unobstructed extension of the desert allows for the sudden, violent and fortuitous irruption of the most heterogeneous forces" and that its language manages to be "continually outside itself, in intimate contact with the world in a powerfully nonrepre- sentational way." But this reading converts Blood Meridian into the sort of anti-oedipal overthrow of all normative discourses in favor of the un- bounded play of the erotic that Deleuze and Guattari admire; Shaviro's is thus yet another redemptive, regenerative reading, albeit in a new idiom. See Shaviro, "'The Very Life of the Darkness,' A Reading of Blood Me- ridian," Southern Quarterly 30 (summer 1992): 111, 113, 117. 5 See Richard B. Woodward, "Cormac McCarthy's Venomous Fiction," The New York Times Magazine, 19 April 1992, 31. 6 For example, the 1868 frontier memoir of John C. Cremony, Life Among the Apaches, describes the death of Gallantin (as Cremony spells it) at the Yuma crossing of the Colorado River in western Arizona. It-or for that matter just about any other account of Western travels published in the nineteenth century-may have provided McCarthy with a model for the ironically understated chapter headings which index his narrative for the reader in a manner that only increases the plot's obscurity (for example, the phrases "Tree of dead babies" and "Attacked by a vampire" preview events in chapter five; other chapter headings are in Spanish, Latin, or German). For comparison, see John C. Cremony, Life Among the Apaches (New York: Indian Head Books, 1991).

Unfortunately, Sepich's work on the novel tries to see it as a web of "allusions" to McCarthy's historical sources. 7 George MacDonald Fraser, Flashman and the Redskins (New York: Alfred A.

Kahn, (New York: Universal Library, 1971), 116. 10 Lukaics, "Narrate or Describe?" 140. 11 "Ibid.," 130. Lukaics refers to narrative representation as "epic," by which he means that it elaborates a coherent worldview of the sort associated with older literary forms. However, since Lukacs also distinguishes novel- istic narrative from that of the epic-precisely because the novel has to elaborate its worldview (something that comes ready-made in the true epic) -and since I want to avail myself of his distinction later in this essay, I have avoided use of "epic" here. For classic accounts of the Western as a genre, see John G.Cawelti, Adventure, Mystery, and Romance: Formula Stories as Art and Popular Culture (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1976), 192-259, or his The Six- Gun Mystique (Bowling Green: Bowling Green University Popular Press, 1971); and Will Wright, Six-Guns and Society: A Structural Study of the Western (Berkeley and Los Angeles: Univ. of California Press, 1975). 12 Lukacs, "Narrate or Describe?" 142, 133. In another essay from 1936, "The Intellectual Physiognomy in Characterization," Lukacs writes, "Characterization that does not encompass ideology cannot be complete. Ideology is the highest form of consciousness" (Writer and Critic, 151). 13 The phrase "the blackness of darkness" is first encountered in Moby- Dick in a comic scene in a black church, into which Ishmael has mis- takenly wandered: "A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the preacher's text was about the black- ness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there" (Herman Melville, Moby-Dick, ed. Harrison Hayford and Hershel Parker [New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1967], 18). That the phrase first appears in the novel in this bit of minstrelry suggests that we probably ought not take Melville's cosmic preoccupations at face value, either. 14 Cormac McCarthy, Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West (1985; reprint, New York: Vintage Books, 1992), 111.

Given Judge Holden's bulk, his hairless white skin, and "pleated brow not unlike a dolphin's" (93), it seems appropriate to view him as a refiguration not of Ahab, as some readers have done, but of the great white whale himself. 20 Vereen Bell has written that "in Blood Meridian ... the thematic discourse is like a dark parody of such idioms" (4). Bell has a point, but I would argue that Blood Meridian is far from being a parody, however "like" one it may sometimes seem. Reading it as such would make its text more comfortable, safer, than it is; the novel challenges our notions of history and literary history more strongly than "parody" permits. 21 Or when it is exhausted, as we might want to say if we read McCarthy with Bakhtin in mind. A Bakhtinian reading of McCarthy's novel might regard the prevalence of description over narration as the result of the thorough interweaving of all the discourses, literary and otherwise, which the novel is "made out of." Thus, to appropriate Bakhtin's terminology, Blood Me- ridian is no longer a novel precisely because it is so very novelized, so intensely focused outwardly on the world, with little or no interest in the self or some other similarly transcendent object, such as its own aesthetic form. See M. M. Bakhtin, "Discourse in the Novel," in The Dialogic Imagi- nation: Four Essays, trans. Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist (Austin: Univ. of Texas Press, 1981), 259-422. 22 Bell, 124. 23 Jane Tompkins, West of Everything; The Inner Life of Westerns (Oxford: Oxford Univ.

Bartlett re- fuses to sentimentalize the human figures in McCarthy's novel and does not treat them as if they were, after all, rounded characters, focusing in- stead on "the rhetorics of visibility, ways of seeing, ... McCarthy's superb regulation of narrative distance and perspective" (4). Thus McCarthy is able to avoid "complacent perspectives based on a society of armchair storytellers or a system of principled theological uniformity"-two of the standard ploys of Southern fiction that Bartlett says "tend to exclude or to overlook the evidence outside their necessarily circumscribed fields of vision" (15). 29 Bartlett argues, apropos of the corpses the necrophiliac Lester Ballard collects in McCarthy's Child of God and the remnants of Appalachian culture also detailed in that novel, that "those remains, the visualized ob-</page><page sequence="27">History and Blood Meridian 459 jects, are precisely remains: they do not speak only of themselves but speak for something other than the empirically self-evident-something ancient, vanished, obscure, enigmatic" (9). I would emphasize that the important thing to notice is that the "remains" in McCarthy's fiction are persistently obscure and enigmatic, especially in Blood Meridian. This ob- scurity cannot be got round by reading harder or more intently. I would note that McCarthy's rhetorical questions in the passage describing the slaughtered Tigua camp are questions, not statements. The difference is crucial. 30 It is worth noting here that McCarthy told Richard Woodward that he thought the novel could "encompass all the various disciplines and inter- ests of humanity" ("Cormac McCarthy's Venomous Fiction," 30). Here, however, I deliberately use the less specific, less valorized term "book" to refer to Blood Meridian because it seems to me that McCarthy-by virtue of having achieved, in his use of other languages and discourses, such a remarkable degree of integration-has taken the "novel" beyond the moment of heteroglossia Bakhtin identifies as its essence. An awareness of the oppositions on which the novel depended for its life-the social oppositions suggested by the different speech patterns of various char- acters, for example, or even the more fundamental opposition between fictional and factual discourses - does not give the reader much purchase on Blood Meridian. 31 Charles Newman, The Post-Modern Aura; TheActofFiction in an Age ofIn- flation (Evanston: Northwestern Univ. Press, 1985), 16. Compare Fredric Jameson's more recent comment on the postmodern: "It is safest to grasp the concept of the postmodern as an attempt to think the present histori- cally in an age that has forgotten how to think historically in the first place" (Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism [Durham: Duke University Press, 1991], ix). Jameson is speaking here not of postmodern fiction, but of theory (both postmodern theory and theories of the post- modern), and what is striking is how both Jameson and Newman identify postmodernism with whatJameson calls "an inverted millenarianism" (1). 32 We might even, following Hayden White, call McCarthy's vision "sub- lime," in that it is informed by a sense of the terrible powers of the natural world. In his description of the "disciplinization" of history, White argues that a rejection of the "sublime" in favor of the "beautiful" is the found- ing gesture of the modern historical method based on narrativity: "It was this demotion of the sublime in favor of the beautiful that constituted the heritage from German idealism to both radical and conservative thought about the kind of utopian existence mankind could justifiably envisage as the ideal aim or goal of any putatively progressive historical process" (The Content of the Form: Narrative Discourse and Historical Representation [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1987], 70). McCarthy's bracket- ing of human narrative, which he represents as only one of a variety of</page><page sequence="28">460 American Literature natural processes, is what gives Blood Meridian its strong dystopian fla- vor, but it seems perverse to us only because we are so enamored of the "beautiful" for the reasons and as a result of the "demotion of the sublime" White describes. 33 Georg Lukacs, The Theory of the Novel: A Historico-Philosophical Essay on the Forms of Epic Literature, trans.

Knopf, 1994), the second installment of McCarthy's "Border Trilogy," describes the adventures of Billy Parham, a New Mexico sixteen-year-old who attempts to return a pregnant she- wolf to the Mexican mountain range from which she has strayed north. In the course of three journeys across the borderland, Billy Parham loses not only the wolf he is attempting to save, but his parents, his brother, their home, most of his horses, and his sense of the passage of time, especially historical time. (He is unaware, for example, of the outbreak of World War Two.) The Crossing is even more intensely focused on the lives of animals than All the Pretty Horses and nearly as bleak as Blood Meridian.</page></plain_text>
