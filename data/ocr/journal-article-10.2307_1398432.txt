<plain_text><page sequence="1">Frank Podgorski Samkara's critique of Samkhyan causality in the Brahmasuitra-bhasya Is there a cause for the universe man experiences? Is there a reason for the existence we share? Sophisticated scientific theories of our day as well as the most ancient records all testify to man's constant struggle with this fundamental question. Does the apparent harmony, the seeming symmetry, the experienced beauty of our environment imply an intelligent cause? Or could our world as we now experience it have simply evolved by chance from a blind, unintelligent cause such as "spontaneous generation"? Such questions have plagued man from the dawn of recorded history. Such questions undoubtedly will plague man for as long as he chooses to record history. Such perduring questions also lie at the base of the Samkhyan-Samkaran debate. The Brahmasutrabhdsya records Samkara's probing analysis of Samkhyan teaching on these crucial issues. Here, Samkara contends that the light of revelation (sruti) as well as logic (tarka) illumined by such revelation both demand that the Samkhyan first cause, pradhina, be viewed as too weak a reason or cause to explain such a wondrous event as existence. In his quest for the cause or reason for existence, Samkara showed great empathy for Samkhyan strivings. Like the Samkhyan, he accepted the principle of satkdryavada (the preexistence of the effect in the cause) as a crucial aid in his search. Indeed, so close did Samkhyan-Samkaran aspirations appear that Samkara did not hesitate to describe the Samkhyan darsana (philosophical system) as "nearest to the Vedanta since it admits of the nondifference of cause and effect,'" and because such weighty authorities as Devala and the author of the Dharmasutras claim to accept it. Far more than the Samkhyan, however, Samkara immersed himself in the scriptural tradition. Such a perspective compelled Samkara to proclaim the paradox that the Samkhyan aspirations which appeared similar actually resulted in a hypothesis that is diametrically opposed to the Vedantic tradition. Since the Samkhyan sought an explanation of what his senses, observation, and inference suggested, his "protoscientific" analysis naturally accented the material dimensions of what he assumed to be the cause of the universe. In so doing, the Samkhyan imposed severe restrictions on his "vision"; by so limiting and narrowing his "vision," he blinded himself to Brahman-Paramatman, the One Reality which Samkara preached as the central truth. Because this diametric opposition was often veiled, Samkara felt it imperative to strongly oppose the Samkhyan world view. In his Bhas.ya, Samkara therefore developed and expanded his principal argument against this "pradhdnamalla" (chief adversary).2 Here, Samkara not only describes the Samkhyan pradhdna as too weak a cause to bring about existence and our universe, which is for him, being and nonbeing indefinable (sat-asat-anir- vacanlya); here, he also identifies Brahman-Paramatman as the material (upa- danakdrana), efficient (nimitta), and operative (kartrtva) cause of whatever is.3 Frank Podgorski is Instructor in Asian Philosophy at Seton Hall University, South Orange, New Jersey.</page><page sequence="2">50 Podgorski Perhaps even more than the Samkhyan, Samkara experienced the frustration of the human search for a cause. Not only do man's senses often misguide him; his evaluations and judgments appear very confused, very arbitrary, and completely relative. Further, all of man's practical, everyday knowledge ap- pears tainted by the residue of past remembrances (saimskara), which remain embedded within his antahkarana (internal noetic instrument). For Samkara, all experience beings and moves in that error or "false-ignorance" (mithy4jhiina), which identifies man's initial awareness of self with his body, his senses, or the object of his senses. We say "my house," "my pen," thus attributing my- ness to material objects; we say "I am heavy" thus assigning attributes of the body to the self. Such confusion and such false cross-attribution, man's com- mon manner of speaking and knowing, is precisely the prison which entraps man. Samkara explains: Superimposition... is necessarily unreal (nithyd).... it is a natural course of worldly conduct resulting from false-ignorance (in a person) to superimpose the sense objects... mutually on each other, through failure to discriminate or distinguish from each other, and by coupling truth and untruth... to imagine thus "I am this," "That is mine."4 Having thus virtually abandoned human knowledge, the search for a cause seemed utterly hopeless. All man's knowledge is by its very nature tainted with the "false ignorance" of "mutual superimposition." To think, to speak would seem a futile plunge into the pit of finitude. Yet Samkara directed his search to the original light of man's first awareness. He sought to understand not the object on which that first light fell; rather, he sought to understand its subject; he sought to know the "knower," that is, himself, the itman. In transferring attention from the object to the subject, Samkara reechoed the perennial quest of the Upanisads: "Yenedam sarvam vijinati, tam kena vijanlyat. Vijhiatram are kena vijadnyad iti."5 Samkara proved indefatigable in his quest for the "knower." Searching beyond commonly experienced actions and beyond the perceptions of the senses (karmendriyas and buddhTndriyas), beyond the finite mind (manas), beyond the individualistic ego-sense (ahamkira), beyond the intellect (buddhi), the pilgrim finally arrived at itman, pure consciousness, self-luminosity itself (svaprakasa, light lighted by its own light). This inward journey, a reliving of the ancient Upanisadic-pilgrimage in quest of "self," could not but remind Samkara of his heritage. Although man's common know- ledge (mithyiijhna) tends to becloud or veil or confuse, sruti, his Vedic-Upani- sadic legacy, reflects True Light without the slightest refraction. Although human knowledge ceaselessly suffers from the psychosis of "mutual super- imposition," Samkara had rediscovered the path of "correct knowledge" (samyagdarsana). "The Scriptures... constitute the authoritative or valid means of right knowledge, because the knowledge of Brahma culminates in the realization of Brahma."6</page><page sequence="3">51 REVELATION Samkara, looking on from the unique perspective that his inward journey had given him, viewed the Samkhyan as challenging the very heart of revelation. Sruti had unveiled Reality to Samkara. There truly exists only Brahman- Paramatman, the Highest Self. Brahman is Pure Being, Pure Intelligence (Caitanya), Pure Light. Intelligence or consciousness or "omniscience" is not a mere attribute of Brahman; rather, it is its very essence. Scripture portrays intelligence as being identical with the Self prior to origination or creation.7 All plurality and all multiplicity, all that we appear to experience, is viewed as a misapprehension of the unity of the absolute. Such a misunderstanding is described in Samkaran terms as neither real (sat) nor unreal (asat); such "maya" veils the real. The identity passages and the promissory statements of scripture clearly identify the individual self with the supreme self (Pure Brahman-Paramatman) which is pure intelligence, the only reality, and thus the cause of "whatever is."8 All the Vedantic texts, Samkara argued, agree in this conclusion.9 He thus had no patience for Samkhyan efforts to claim scriptural authority for the causality of "nonintelligent pradhana."9 Such a blind, haphazard cause, he viewed as opposed to the intelligence exhibited in the Upanisads. Even the Samkhyan did not pretend to attribute intelligence to original pradhana. How, Samkara asked, could our complex world of sophisticated multiplicity have evolved from such a blind cause? Moreover, to consign intelligence to a mere evolute of pradhana or to interpret the mahivikya in only a figurative manner is a gross denigration of revelation. "Tat tvam asi" is to be understood literally or not at all. Anything less is an unwarranted watering down of scriptural revelation. Thus sruti led Samkara to conclude that only "omniscient Brahma is the cause of the transmigratory world."1 Samkhyan history exhibits an effort to link itself with the sheltering umbrella of the scriptural tradition when convenient. The eventual approbation of the Samkhya as astika (orthodox) rather than ndstika (heterodox) testifies to the partial success of such efforts. Part of this reaching-out was an attempt to identify Samkhyan tattvas (elements) or Samkhyan models in scriptural texts. Indeed, many scriptural words and phrases do appear to share a common cosmology with the Samkhyan perspective. Words such as avyakta (unmanifest), vyakta (manifest), mahat (the great one), and purusa are certainly found throughout scripture and even in such important Vedic passages as the Katha Upanisad. Models such as pahcapahcajana (five five-people) and the tricolored aja (she-goat) of the Svetidsvatara Upanisad also suggest a Samkhyan point of view. Samkara, however, recognized the serious danger in such superficial identification. To simply identify various scriptural words with technical Samkhyan tattvas is to claim too much. Such an identification implies a chal- lenge to the very Brahman-Atman Reality. Rather, Samkara argued convincingly,</page><page sequence="4">52 Podgorski the aim of both the Katha Upanisad and the Svetiivatara Upanisad is simply to distinguish between the states of bondage and release. Brahmavidya (Brahma- knowledge), the initial verse of both these passages, identifies the goal to which they were pointing. The total context of these scriptures indicates that they intend to convey a knowledge of the unity of the inner self and Brahman by describing the passage through samsara (the endless cycle of life, death, and rebirth) and the eventual release of the Brahman-Atman realization. Samkara, recalling his own inward journey, wished to aid others in their search. Thus, he repeatedly recommended Samkhya-Yogic discipline as a means of assisting one in the quest for release. Nonetheless, he strongly resisted Samkhyan efforts to exclusively identify Vedic words or phrases with Samkhyan tattvas. Not only was this to claim too much; it also endangered the very purpose of scrip- ture, namely, Brahman-realization; it represented but another attempt to reduce the Brahman-Paramatman realization to a human analysis. Yet the Samkhyan persisted in appealing to scripture in the hope of strength- ening his position. He also delighted in citing scriptural passages which ap- parently contradict the doctrine of Brahman's material causality. Samkara readily concedes that many apparently contradictory passages may be cited to describe the manner of origination or creation. Such apparent contradictions are meaningless, since the purpose of the Vedas is not at all to teach a scientific manner of creation. Creation, Samkara insists, is described merely for the spiritual purpose of teaching that the effect is not really different from the cause. 1 The purpose of all the various scriptural analogies (clay, iron, gold, sparks) is to teach that the effect preexists in the cause, that is, to help searching man to realize his Brahman-Paramatman identity. On this most fundamental and most profound dogmatic point, Samkara maintains, all the varied Vedantic texts and descriptions are in perfect agreement. This persistent quest for scriptural authority led the Samkhyan to cite smrti as well as sruti. Clearly Kapila, Asuri, Paficasikha, and others, although teach- ing various forms of Samkhya, all agree in proclaiming nonintelligent pradhana the cause of the world. Such teachings have even acquired the status of astika (affiliated with the Vedic tradition). Such a tenet, Samkara protests, not only contradicts the whole of sruti; it also opposes such significant smrti as the Puranas, the Bhagavad?ta, and the Dharmasutras. Is there a norm or guide for such contradictions? The Puirva MTmirmsd explicitly states: "Where there is a contradiction between sruti and smrti, the smrti are to be disregarded."12 Thus on the basis of the paramount witness and importance of sruti, Samkara main- tained that nonintelligent pradhana must be set aside even if the existence of contradictory smrti on this topic be admitted. Nonintelligent pradhdna is diametrically opposed to pure intelligence, Brahman-Paramatman. Nor is pradhina the only contradictory Samkhyan smrti. By its hypothesis of the plurality of selves, the Samkhyan statement contradicts the teachings of Manu as well as the Vedas which explicitly proclaim the doctrine of the one</page><page sequence="5">53 universal self, Brahman-Paramatman. To persist in such Samkhyan pluralism is to subvert the very unity of self. This assertion of a perdurance of multiple purusas or a plurality of "consciousnesses" even following Samkhyan kaivalyic isolation appears a "specification," an "enumeration," an anthropomorphic analysis which certainly seems to run counter to absolute oneness. Hence, Samkara argues that smrti as well as sruti bid the Vedantin dismiss the Samkh- yan teachings of nonintelligent pradhina and purusabahutva. Both threaten Brahman-Paramatman, the very heart of revelation. REASON ENLIGHTENED BY REVELATION As Samkara pursued his inner quest for light, sruti directed him to his goal. "Brahma-realization" led him to identify pure consciousness, pure intelligence, as the cause of whatever is. Only such a pure spiritual cause seemed powerful enough to "create, sustain, and reabsorb" the transmigratory world. In so identifying the cause, Samkara attempted to shift the notion of intelligence from the world of finite cognition (avidyi, false knowledge) to the purified realm of Brahma-vidyi (Brahma-knowledge). "Lead me from the unreal to the real," the Upanisads exhorted. Such a spiritual perspective not only pro- ceeded from revelation, it also challenged and limited the scope of human cognition and reason. Yet if ever a spiritual perspective is to be realized by man, it must dialogue and communicate with cognition and reason, man's common sources of light. Tarka (logic or reason) was thus a crucial pramiina (source of knowledge) at the very center of the Samkaran-Samkhyan debate. Yet, Samkara employed "only such reasoning as is in consonance with scrip- ture."13 Such "enlightened reasoning" challenged the Samkhyan in many ways. Reason by itself, Samkara argued, is simply too weak to fathom a transcendental cause. To reduce existence and our observable world to two forces, pradhana and purusa in interplay, is a noble attempt to realistically describe the world process; yet such a finite description fails to search for the real cause. Assuming its immediate environment as "real," it fails to search for the ultimately real. Samkara's "reasoned" critique thus sought to lift the Samkhyan out of the realm of observable phenomena and to suggest the light of another dimension. For Samkara, cosmic evolution is impossible without a conscious, controlling agent, which he identified as Brahman-Paramatman. Focusing on the Samkh- yan description of origination in terms of spontaneous generation, he charged the Samkhyan with failing to adequately account for the original impetus, which supposedly brought about origination. He asked, how can the Samkhyan explain the original disturbance of the balance within milaprakrti? What is the reason for the original elan vital? "Spontaneous generation" is too hap- hazard to explain the intelligence which appears so obvious to Samkara within our universe. To attribute origination to the proximity (samnidhi) of purusa is</page><page sequence="6">54 Podgorski to contradict the very nature of purusa which by definition is nonactive; it is also to entangle purusa in the eternal prison of our transmigratory world thus making kaivalya, the consistent promise of revelation and even the goal of the Samkhyan, seem an impossibility. Beauty, harmony, order, and design appear to abound within our universe. On this, both Samkara and the Samkhyan agree. Their conclusions about the cause of such teleology, however, are quite different. The Samkhyan feels that pradhina is able to evolve into such patterns. Samkara maintains that the external design and internal order of the universe demand intelligence as the primary cause. The Samkhyan assumption of nonintelligent pradhina as the evolving cause is the assigning of too large a task to too weak a cause. At best, the Samkhyan can offer a reasonable picture of what he assumes to be "reality." Although he may call this a "realistic" explanation of the observable world, he fails to search for the ultimately real cause. Content with reducing world- transformation to blind, haphazard occurrence, he fails to adequately account for real intelligence. Purpose or motivation is a key element in any darsana which attempts to explain existence. Here, the contradictory Samkhyan teaching of purusdrtha (for the sake ofpurusa) is very challengeable. A nonintelligent principle evolving into an absurd universe appears an apt summary of the Samkhyan world view. Whether he claims evolution takes place for the enjoyment or for the release of purusa, the Samkhyan ends up with a self-contradictory goal that is impossible to attain. "If enjoyment, what enjoyment," Samkara asks, "can belong to the soul which is naturally incapable... of pleasure and pain? More- over, there would be no opportunity for final release... on account of the in- finite number of objects of pradhdna to be enjoyed by the soul."14 If, on the other hand, the Samkhyan claims release as the goal, then what is the reason for cosmic evolution? The evolutionary dance of prakrti would then seem utterly absurd and useless. Would "released purusa" (if such kaivalya be possible) be in any way better off than previously? How is kaivalya at all a gain over the "original equipoise"? When the Samkhyan challenged Samkara to specify a motive or purpose, he simply refocused attention on ultimacy (Brahman-Paramitman). Acknowledging the inability of man to designate motivation or purpose, Samkara places his trust in ultimacy and seeks to transfer a purified, more-than-human notion of intelligence from the feeble understanding of human knowledge (mithydjhina) to a Brahmavidyi realiza- tion. He deliberately seeks to avoid postulating any idealized anthropomorphic projection of man's manufacture. The intelligence of "whatever is" depends not on man's feeble understanding but on real intelligence. Thus Samkara is quite content to attribute his surroundings to the "sportfulness' of Brahman. "Although the creation of this world appears to us a weighty and difficult undertaking, it is mere play (lila) to the Lord whose power is unlimited."1 5</page><page sequence="7">55 THE CONTRAST The debate within the Brahmasiutra Samkara Bhisya has dramatized the gulf between the Samkhyan world view and the Samkaran vision. Nonintelligent pradhina joined with purusa is the Samkhyan explanation of the cause of an observable world which he assumes to be real. Pradhana is explicitly described as undergoing real transformations (parintma-vada) for the sake of the purusas during cosmic evolution. Revelation, however, unveiled another cause to Samkara. Our experienced world is described by Samkara as "real" up until the moment of enlightenment. When the realization of Brahman-Atman as the one reality dawns, then all that was experienced prior to illumination is judged as merely apparent reality (vivartavdda). Brahman-Paramatman, the one reality, is thus the Samkaran cause for whatever is; indeed, it is the only reality. Our entire world of multiplicity, our world of common experience, is merely namarupa (names and forms made current by speech). Although in accomoda- tion to our common manner of speech and our ordinary way of making dis- tinctions, Brahman may now appear the cause or foundation for all observable phenomena, this vivartavida perspective must eventually yield to that which is beyond nimarupa, namely, Brahmavidya, the Brahman-Paramatman identi- fication. Since the designation of even Brahman's causality within the terms of namarupa has only a temporary value, Samkara did not feel it necessary to seriously pursue this "particularization" of ndmarupa; he preferred the Brah- man-Paramatman realization. Samkara's critique of purusabahutva has just as emphatically accented the distance between Samkhyan and Samkaran conclusions. The Samkhyan per- sistently believes in a plurality of distinct and individual purusas or conscious- nesses which are both real and all-pervading (vyapaka); these multiple purusas perdure even after kaivalyic isolation. This is in striking contrast to the vision of Samkara. He contends that individual consciousnesses are mere reflections (abhisa) which appear to exist prior to illumination because of nescience (avidyti). To claim a plurality of perduring, all-pervading purusas is thus to contradict the one reality, Brahman-Paramatman. Samkara had once termed the SSamkhyan aspirations nearest to Vedanta; paradoxically, Samkhyan con- clusions forced Samkara to label the Samkhyan his chief adversary. AN EVALUATION Our aim has been to understand Samkara's reaction to the Samkhyan world view. Clearly, his critique has isolated many severe Samkhyan liabilities such as the source of the original elan vital, the weakness of blind pradhana, the apparent prison of multiple purusabahutva, and the exacting problem of genuine kaivalya. Clearly, he warns against the facile acceptance of material first causes spontaneously evolving into intelligible patterns of cosmic order. His con-</page><page sequence="8">56 Podgorski clusion, the result of an inward spiritual journey, was greatly assisted by scrip- tural revelation. Yet such a transcendental cause is extremely difficult to explain. Critics are fond of charging that at times Samkara does seem to slip from a Brahmavivartavada assessment of his surroundings to what might better be described as a miiyi-parinima-vdda perspective. Indeed, Samkara's employment of several realistic illustrations, his very use of the word parindma,16 and his realistic description of the reabsorption (pralaya) of the world all lend support to this charge. Such apparently realistic assessments of transformation are puzzling and seem quite contradictory from a Brahman-Paramatman perspec- tive. They illustrate well the immense difficulties of adopting a transcendental perspective and still trying to communicate in the limited language of finite man. Mystics and visionaries of all ages and cultures share this common plight and frustration. To list this objection is merely to suggest one of the difficulties inherent in a serious evaluation of the Samkaran alternative to the Samkhyan world-view. Such an immense task, however, goes far beyond the scope of our essay. It is to weigh the entire Brahman-Paramatman perspective in all the intricacies and complexities of its relationship with our surroundings. Our task, however, has focused on Samkara's reaction to the Samkhyan tradition. His critique has exposed the serious weaknesses and essential contradictions of this world view. Concomitantly, we have also begun to see Samkara's contrasting tran- scendental perspective. Enough has been seen to sense that Samkara's vision is a frank statement of finite man abandoning his initial preconceptions and assumptions and stretching forth for Infinity. Although Samkara does not fully resolve the precise relationship between Absolute and finite being, and even though he does not completely account for the interaction between the transcendental and the immanent, nevertheless, his Brahman-Paramatman statement is a classic effort in this direction. Nor was Samkara's statement without a missionary appeal to finite man. Everyman's pilgrimage toward Atman is fraught with detours. To be assisted, as Samkara proclaims, by the mahivakya is to receive invaluable assistance. Brahmavidyi, the Brahman-Paramatman realization, promises illumination. It awakens finite man to the brilliant Light of transcendence, while simultan- eously illuminating the immanence of self. It transfers the quest from the phenomenal world of observation to a transcendental cause. Brahman-Param- atman is the cause or reason for "whatever is." Such Brahmavidya far surpasses mithydjhdna. Such a cause is immeasurably more powerful than any detectable pattern of observation or natural law (svabhiva). Samkara, like the sruti, points to such a cause. As such, his directions and directives prove an invaluable guide in the search for the cause or reason for existence and our universe, in our journey toward Brahman-Paramatman. Samkara's pilgrimage has clarified the scriptural mirga (path) for those who follow.</page><page sequence="9">57 NOTES 1. Brahmas6tra-Sghnkarbhdsyam, I, 4, 28, Mahadeva Shastri Bakre, ed.
