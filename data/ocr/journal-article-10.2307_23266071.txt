<plain_text><page sequence="1">JarreM's Allegories Stuart Christie Jarrell saw a strangeness in the daylight, and loved inhuman nature. —-John Updike, "Fly by Night" I With particular reference to the work of Hawthorne and Melville, Sharon Cameron argues that allegory, while hardly unique to the United States, has enjoyed a particular after-life within American letters. For Cameron, allegory requires the body's dissolution as an instru ment of at times violent self-realization (1981, 4-5). In 1854, Hawthorne famously wrote to his friend James T. Fields, "Upon my honor, I am not quite sure that I entirely comprehend my own meaning in some of these blasted allegories; but I remember that I always had a meaning—or, at least, thought I had" (Myerson 2002, 181).1 Hawthorne's ambivalence about the use of allegory—as that rather confounding structure upon which to read the body, character, and canon—is suggestive. With reference to the Stuart Christie is Professor of English at Hong Kong Baptist University. He is the author of two books, Worlding Forster: The Passage from Pastoral (Routledge, 2005) and Plural Sovereignties and Contemporary Indigenous Literature (Palgrave, 2009).</page><page sequence="2">32 College Literature 39.2 [Spring 2012] poetry of Randall Jarrell, I want to urge, if only delicately, a principled return to a blasted allegorical criticism in relation to the body it blasts. I am inter ested in doing so, not only to sound the fuller length of a uniquely American canonical constant which Cameron posits across a longer (in Jarrell's case, modernist) literary history, but also to recognize, or refamiliarize, allegory as that foundling trope of formal criticism prematurely abandoned by post structuralist orthodoxy Recuperating allegorical criticism allows us, in turn, to reconsider (or even, as Jarrell supposed, to reinvent) the process of speaking or writing the story or poem in relation to the body as, to cite Cameron's famous words, "more than what we are or less than what we are—that, more or less, we could be different from what we are" (1981, 4). At once quiet and quietist, Jarrell's poetic allegories of the body in a state of becoming—and not strictly those of the body in pain—breathed new life into the form and method of allegory as an instrument of poetry He did so in times of philosophical uncertainty, by re orienting the more traditional properties of allegory toward more modern and phenomenological uses. As Deborah L. Madsen notes, "allegory enters the debate about the nature of [modernity] as a mode of perception, rather than in its conventional role as a referential method. Rather than an exegetical solu tion to the crisis of referentiality, allegory ... is conceived as a way of register ing the fact of crisis" (1994,119). The turn within modernist letters Madsen recognizes—toward percep tion and away from referentiality—is significant, because it allowed Jarrell to re-fashion allegory so as to serve a dual purpose: first, of transcending the text and context of the world as given; and, second, of at once re-centering and de-centering the reader (or writer) as perceiver. Jarrell, like other poets of his remarkable generation, certainly registered perceptions of the epistemologi cal crisis Madsen describes; beyond this, his metamorphic poetry was equal ly therapeutic. The bodies and perceptions of his personae undergo change as the formal, allegorical response to historical change. Jarrell's metamorphic allegories served equally well as evidence for the processes (and not solely the products) of philosophical inquiry concerning the imagined fate for the indi vidual human body (including an understanding of being as, inexorably, linked to the fate of that imagining) in the modern world.2 Offering poetic process in the interests of therapy, Jarrell's allegories could reframe the leitmotif of the modernist self in crisis in line with Edward Hirsch's formulation, as the "passionate involvement and deep identification with the sufferings of others" and the "simple commitment to the humanly flawed" (Ferguson 2003, 10). The body and spirit of the hollow man might be transformed as the imagining of recovery. Jarrell is accordingly able to engage in a kind of allegorical transport, beyond the crisis of text and con</page><page sequence="3">Stuart Christie 33 text. His poems ponder the ultimate dissolution of the poetic persona not as a problem of ontology (presence and being) but as one of transitive process (becoming). II It falls beyond the scope of this essay to circumnavigate the globe of allegor ical discourse, whose short-hand (as 'allegory') emerged as a kind of vague, catch-all taxonomy within late-modernist criticism. Even so, distinct strands have emerged within the wider body of allegorical theorization, notably nar rative and symbolist approaches, which deserve brief consideration. These provide guideposts by which Jarrell's own stylized uses of existing or con ventional allegory may be judged. Like Madsen, Lynn Wells focuses on allegory as equally possessing and prepossessing of narrative; namely, how allegory offers pattern to storytelling, and how even differing methods of storytelling may converge in the inter ests of the multi-layered subject or self. Allegorical or allegorizing subjects "talk about themselves ... recognizing in the process that several different lev els of interpretation, including the allegorically self-referential, can be brought to the same text" (Wells 2003, 3; emphasis in original). Such "alle gories of telling," in Wells' nice phrase, occasion a broader patterning exceed ing the subject in discourse—invoking and shaping the world apart—even as they ask the multi-layered story to constitute a locus within narrative, called the poet or the self. An example of such allegorizing to the purpose of story may be found in "The Bronze David of Donatello" where Jarrell's iterative forms, which reveal the parable of David and Goliath, are liberated via a sequence of sim iles: To so much strength, those overborne by it Seemed girls, and death came to it like a girl, Came to it, through the soft air, like a bird— So that the boy is like a girl, is like a bird Standing on something it has pecked to death. (Jarre11 2001,275) Jarrell's use of allegory here represents becoming as the effect of a gerund, preferring the description of processes to those of received states whereby the force and momentum of metamorphosis exerts heretofore unthinkable pressures upon static tenses. Michel Benamou rejects the parade of metaphor Jarrell here unleashes: over-bearing strength making its victims girls, death stealing over the dead Goliath quietly as a girl, death-as-girl becoming a bird, the boy (David) like a girl, David (girl-like) as a victor, a girl-bird standing on a dead thing (object), and pecking it to death.3 I sug</page><page sequence="4">34 College Literature 39.2 [Spring 2012] gest, rather, that it is precisely the on-going reiteration of assembled and subsequently dismantled symbolic forms that catalyzes Jarrell's unhinging of allegory beyond the human. Jarrell's allegory is here deployed in an iterative sequence, which links the transforming self to a specific narrative line or telos moving from image to image, and as the product of an on-going dynamic or process that at once structures and motivates the story. Such a 'process-allegory' allows the embod ied subjects of stories to impact upon the narrative structures they inhabit, even as they are subject to the latter's constraints and enunciations. Accordingly, the subjects of stories are not only enunciated by allegory, but are also expressive and creative within its narrative or textual confines. Process allegories may open along a given narrative arc, but their subjects will dictate the trajectory and the speed of its unfurling. The subject of a process-allego ry may speak back (or against) the structure the story entertains. Allegories in a state of process may be further motivated by the desires and interests the reader supplies. In his important study, Angus Fletcher posits the symbolic pattern (or weave) of allegory as proleptic; that is, as a sustain ing interpretive field allowing the reader to anticipate allegorical actions, heroic and demonic, before they occur; and, most significantly, before they are regulated by a single, authoritative reading (1993,54). Jarrell's career-long fight for allegorical forms as yet unrealized, and not solely those already emergent forms governing existing poetic practice, nicely illustrates Fletcher's claim that conventionally understood, allegory "appears not only to restrict the reader's freedom, but further to restrict itself, in scope of moral attitude and degree of enigma" (305). By contrast, Fletcher's iconoclastic appreciation of allegory is revisionist, insofar as it seeks to embolden a community of readers whose unpredictable and varied responses to allegory must motivate an uneven access to the lat ter's symbolic properties. Such uneven reader responses allow us to interpret Jarrell's process-allegories as the products of a readerly moment, rather than as the settling-out of received interpretations based on moral suppositions of whichever time and place. Jarrell's "demonic" nature (as Lowell put it) accordingly informed his use of allegory, which possessed the potential for alternative readings as much as authoritative closure. This over-riding sus pension of morality, including the disclosure of uncertainty morality would dispel, is a key feature of Jarrell's technique, and a point to which I will return. In their encoding of an expansive symbolic field which may suspend a clarifying or unifying moral, Jarrell's process-allegories link an individual per sona's becoming to a larger, globalizing symbolic framework. Edwin Honig rightly describes this connectivity as "part of a larger existence [shared],</page><page sequence="5">Stuart Christie 35 generically and typically, with [all] other allegories" (1966, 14). Generic and yet interstitial, ever ready to totalize by presuming to link individual storied events and actions to the entire signifying world of being and knowing, alle gories are the supernovae of the poetic mind. Once uttered, they radiate out ward at unfathomable speeds, and their inspiration can only be captured askance in the moment of transformation. An example of this kind of pandemic allegoresis Honig describes may be found in "The Woman at the Washington Zoo" where, superseding the ontology imposed by the "I," alternative forms at once crowd and supersede Jarrell's poetic landscape: The saris go by me from the embassies. Cloth from the moon. Cloth from another planet. They look back at the leopard like the leopard. And I .... (Jarrell 2001,215) As above, the persona watches ambulatory saris, their forms at once vacant and molded, inviting as well as shaping the projection of anthropomorphism. But projected by whom and upon whom or what? Left on their own, saris cannot watch; yet these do. And here, they watch leopards, as if they, too, were leopards, while the "I" trails on watching saris watch leopards. Here the "I" functions as merely a placeholder in the poem around which the logic of spectatorship revolves, motivating the dispersal of other forms centrifugally: saris, leopards, and a vulture without the "red helmet" (Jarrell 2001,216). And these are only those watchers named in the poem. Clearly, the per sonal initial take on the scene ("The saris go by me") establishes position for the poem and anchors his or her own subjectivity. Initially, he or she reads converging surfaces much as we read the poem's own representations, as the recognition of similar patterns. As we continue reading, however, accreting images (leopard spots and sari wefts, Washington D.C. transformed into a lunar landscape) interact with proliferating subject positions (leopard, sari, persona, you, me) which, in turn, constitute a community of responses with in the broadening signifying field. The persona is quickly outdistanced, cen trifugally, by the plenitude of others' readings. Such an outward radiation of alternative forms, itself the result of a breakaway reaction involving multilat eral readership in the absence of a centered subject, disperses the allegorical potential for becoming well beyond ontology: I, not I, south Asia, the moon, a leopard, a sari, Washington, D.C., Hong Kong, the moon, Chicago, wher ever and whenever I seek to pattern (belatedly) whatever others have pat terned. In the patterning of the poem's imagery, we recall the narrative purpos es to which allegory may be put (Wells 2003), as well as the totalizing</page><page sequence="6">36 College Literature 39.2 [Spring 2012] impulse, via symbolic association, which would connect any one image to the wider world (Fletcher 1993). Via its linking of human to animal imagery, Jarrell's poetry likewise disperses the tyranny of human privilege as a species, by acknowledging change as encompassing all allegorizing—and so all cre ation—equally.4 Just as the birds of Chaucer's The Parliament of Fowls are per sonified in order to transport civilized discourse into the cacophony of "sheer noise," the "runaway loquacity" of an avian congress (Paxson 1994, 90), so Jarrell's allegorical signifying chains (his prosopopeia) are animated and enlivened by the proximity of the animal and non-sentient to the human. For both Fletcher and Homg, however, the inevitability of the persona's allegorical maturation nevertheless lies apart from allegorical process as mere iteration of on-going story or the pandemic of an ever-expanding symbolic field. After all, allegories do not inscribe only freedoms, but also limitations: In allegory, where the concepts of philosophy often merge with the illu sion-making of literary art, the moral imagination imitates the growth of the individual consciousness within the limiting, essentially tragic condi tions of human existence. (Honig 1966,139-140) As Cameron's work on the corporeal self likewise reminds us, the subject of allegory is very often subjected by it, in the form of a restrictive moral imag ination that would impose the preferred form or reading over a merely func tional allegoresis. The ceaseless reinvention of the allegory's story may be trumped, in the end, by a moral gesture: the self fatigued, worn out, rendered tragic through the telling of his or her own story as a commonplace of exis tence. But here, perhaps, is where Jarrell's own process-allegories strike us as so true, so Miltonic, in their defiance. His persona's desiring refuses to die: rather, it is transmuted into new shapes, in deferral of the closure a conven tional allegorical interpretation must always confer. For Jarrell, the mechan ics of allegory must always exceed, even as they invite, interpretation. Moreover, becoming human in Jarrell's work requires entertaining alter native sites of subjectivity along the routes its very telos presupposes, and human imaginings (moral and otherwise) may be revealed only by the light of other, vestigial traces (usually non-sentient, plant and animal forms) through which anterior versions of being have passed. Ill Perceived contrariness, alongside the lack of a stable position relative to his peers and the succeeding tradition, distinguished Jarrell as poet and critic from the very beginning. Yet his unique differences apart from his contem poraries were more conventional than is often supposed. Jarrell's dissent from the tradition, as I hope to suggest, was mainly formal and allegorical, rather than substantively different. The claims he made on behalf of form were less</page><page sequence="7">Stuart Christie 37 radical, for example, than the wholesale epistemological retreat from text and context Auden staged on behalf of his Christianity. Both poets, in fact, searched capably for alternatives to the problem of modernist indeterminacy, with the later Auden recovering an absolute First Cause, and Jarrell reassert ing the force of a more flexible form—allegory—in response to history. And yet, heuristically speaking, the reasons for Auden's changes are more or less understood and unquestioned by scholars, whereas Jarrell's motivations con tinue to be puzzled over. David Bergman, for example, affirms that Jarrell's poetry is "disturbing," and notes that he "fills his poems with folk and fairy tales, children and talk ing animals, all the distractions of easy reading, and then shoots you between the eyes" (2004, 350). By "disturbing Jarrell," a phrase that serves as the title of his essay, Bergman recasts the phrase's adjective as its gerund. Bergman does so in order to ask his readers how the unsettling of Jarrell's canonical place may be linked to further questions about his poetic virtuosity. That is, Bergman asks us to establish imagined links between the ways in which Jarrell's unorthodoxy as a subject may have impacted upon his ability to pres ent a stable subject for poetry. Effectively, Bergman is reading Jarrell's distur bances allegorically, relative to the modernist field he presumes as otherwise normative, and using the suppositions provided by a moralistic framework that first establishes conventionality, and then seeks to locate Jarrell beyond the boundaries of those conventions. Appropriately, Bergman hearkens back to the moralistic tradition that, at least in its Christian formulation, has required the Word to inhabit the flesh. Modernists seeking to invoke this tradition needed only to go so far back as Matthew Arnold, and here I quote Bergman's own words: "how much hard er is it for the rest of us [reading Jarrell] to cope with the unbearable about which we can do nothing?" (2004, 352). The notion of modernists doing nothing recalls Arnold's injunction against 'doing as one likes,' reminding us of even older coordinates for Jarrell's and Auden's disturbances, here post dated as ciphers of critical discomfort.5 In this context, then, Jarrell's shad owed, at times spiteful, and often willfully sentimental poetry engages with an inverted and hollowed-out modernism, which is neither as clean nor as imagistic as the Arnoldian tradition and its New Critical descendants might have preferred.6 One generation prior to Bergman, John Updike also promulgated the view of Jarrell as disturbing. In "Fly By Night," Updike laments Jarrell's un childlike children's stories on two specific grounds: first, for their lack of an integrative technique connecting human and animal realms; and second, for the presence, as far as Updike sees it, of a pathology inhabiting the very core of Jarrell's animal project, which is "locked behind the combinative oddness,</page><page sequence="8">38 College Literature 39.2 [Spring 2012] the mix of pluralism and isolation and warping transposition . . . around an unseen center" (Ferguson 1983, 60). Against Theodore Roethke's line which he greatly prefers ("She'd more sides than a seal"), Updike poses Jarrell's owls in Fly By Night (1976), which bear "symbolic menace" deep into a forested nightmare. For Updike, Jarrell's animal worlds are not suitably child-like but are "visually disturbing" with a "sinister stir," left "unresolved by the clarify ing of power of adulthood promises" (1983, 58-59). Updike's reading dis misses as un-workmanlike and as "warped transpositions" the joins between animal and human forms, which for Jarrell remained as uneasy yet motivat ing sutures.Yet Jarrell, not Updike, is right; there is something monstrous and excessive at the center of the human: our otherness to ourselves, often pro jected as violence onto less powerful bodies and forms. Jarrell leaves this excess of a willful human animality un-policed by a morally evaluative framework, and Updike clearly blames him for not domesticating it. Going back still further before Updike's damning postmortem, Jarrell's poetry did seem unsettling in its own time, even among those who champi oned it. Robert Lowell, Jarrell's old friend, described the latter's work as "wild" and "monstrous" (Ferguson 1983, 27). It was Lowell, moreover, who first declared Jarrell's poetry to be audacious and subversive, as well as demonstrating a stubborn delight in phase-shifting through alternate capac ities: "Monstrously knowing and monstrously innocent—one does not know just where to find [Jarrell]" (27). I argue that when read as allegories, Jarrell's poems respond effectively to charges concerning the absence of technique and the existence of a dark and centered pathology. Nor, by taking on such a distinguished lineage, am I interested in polemic for its own sake. Rather, I seek to correct a residual and somewhat patronizing moralizing strain in Jarrell criticism since Lowell, which still refuses (to my mind squeamishly) to leave us kids at home alone with Uncle Randall's poems. Jarrell's refusal to pathologize allegory the way many of his critics assert he does—-as disturbing—signals his preference for an allegorical poetry functional of becoming, rather than affirming the best that has been thought and known everywhere. He likewise seeks to re-route desiring energies, which otherwise link human mastery to subjectivity, toward poetic reconsiderations of form. Jarrell's mechanics, I suggest, moti vate further discussion of a poetry of perpetual motion to the very limit of subjectivity itself. In the following section, I will suggest that the question of critical dis comfiture apart, Jarrell and Auden were in many ways of a piece in their time as perceivers of the crisis of representation to which Madsen alludes. As a par ticular kind of modernist allegorizing, Jarrell's poetry reacted predictably to a specific set of problems Auden first identified, and responded to them in</page><page sequence="9">Stuart Christie 39 terms Auden helped to formulate, even as their poetry in response to the demands of the time was vastly different. Unlike Auden's, however, Jarrell's legacy has remained fettered by a lack of critical imagination. Critics have not recognized sufficiently that by returning to allegory Jarrell was simply responding to the present and negative injunction Auden had first emphati cally declared:"poetry makes nothing happen" (1991,248). Equally an illus tration of and response to Auden's assessment of the predicament of postwar Anglo-American poetry, Jarrell's turn toward allegory occurred at an impor tant historical and ethical crossroads.7 IV For all their differences, Jarrell and the later Auden believed faithfully in sto rytelling as a necessary restorative when facing the modernist onslaught on truth. By attempting to make the poetry of storytelling answer to and for the present (modernist) paucity of context, both poets embraced narrative foun dationalism as a compensatory salvation. Auden's preferred narrative was Anglo-Catholic, whether of inspiration or consequence; Jarrell's was confab ulatory, as the necessary arrival of being at change. Both heaved with the fer vor of the converted to the principle that our being necessarily derives from those stories we believe in and write about. As such, both poets were descen dents of an allegorical tradition.8 Yet, for Jarrell, the story a poem tells not only constitutes a proposition requiring evaluative judgment (as true or false, good or evil) but a function al process driven by the listener's root dissatisfaction both with the world as it is and with the world the story describes. This interactive negativity also motivates the listener-reader's present-continuous desire for change, through his or her wishing against the poem or story's form as presently told: A story, then, tells the truth or a lie—is a wish, or a truth, or a wish modi fied by a truth. Children ask first of all: "Is it a true story?"They ask this of the storyteller, but they ask of the story what they ask of a dream: that it satisfy their wishes. (Jarrell 1967,140) Jarrell states the problem of such a wishing antinomianism allegorically, as the catalyst for narrative change once activated by the listener's or reader's desire. Delicate and precarious, the negativity of wishing transforms the given poem or story into a future narrative desired presently, and throws the gauntlet down before static forms of the narrative present. Wishes are thus prescient demands: not only that the poem or story as given must change but that they shall, in any event, generate narrative—of the body, the life, the faith—as a forward process. Wishes transgress present stories as they find them and in so doing create new stories.</page><page sequence="10">40 College Literature 39.2 [Spring 2012] Moreover, the negativity of such wishing rewrites poems and stories beyond closure, as if; the 'as if' imparts the narrative basis of a desire for change beyond present context, world, and body. In such a rendering, desire is necessarily metamorphic of present narrative and wishing makes otherwise inert stories and poetry happen. But how to write the story of a poem itself in the process of changing, necessarily subjected to the catalytic power of the listeners wishing, and metamorphosing before our very eyes, mutatis mutan dis? Beyond futility, how can and should one write such a story of dissatis faction with present stories at all? Such was Auden's pre-emptive strike against the Anglo-American modernist establishment before the Second World War, and in so doing he declared a vocation for the next generation of poets. Even so, I would suggest it was Jarrell who was best equipped, after the war, to write the kind of poetry whose necessity Auden invoked; that is, the poetry of nothing as it is happening. Both poets participated equally in the movement requiring poetry to serve as an instrument of change beyond present context; characterizing such change, and to what purpose, was the agenda of the moment. The two poets diverged considerably, however, when it came to the question of how best to trammel the negativity of wishes. They differed, that is, in whether or not to sacralize specific narratives as part of an evaluative process (better and worse stories, good versus evil wishes) so as to distinguish, in turn, between the precepts for which narratives serve as vehicles. They dif fered, to whit, about how to fix the problem of the same story satisfying con flicting wishes, including how to demonstrate the desire of and for the body.9 This problem of satisfying conflicting wishes—for Auden, conflicting wishes must terminate in sin; for Jarrell, they inevitably assume new shapes and guises—presents a distinction of kind we can make between the two poets' use and appreciation of form, between Jarrell's antinomianism and Auden's skepticism.10 For Jarrell, wishing for alternative form is irrevoca bly productive and an end in itself: the negativity of wishing assures the for ward continuity of narrative and of allegory, heedless of the law. In contrast, for Auden wishing can only ever be a provisional, if nevertheless necessary, means of highlighting narrative process as an inescapable problem which the promise of God's Word alone satisfies. This is why there is no such thing as process-allegory in Auden, apart from the One Process in service to the One Allegory. If Auden turned toward the telos of an Absolute Desire, the Form of all forms ("Jesu,Joy of Man's Desiring"), Jarrell settled on the lesser mechanics of desire as an engine of possibility regardless of the destination.11 Ultimately, the functionality of Jarrell's allegory is best imparted by the variety of wish es his forms undertake; there is no meaning prior to or succeeding the wish</page><page sequence="11">Stuart Christie 41 es that give life to the inertness of narrative. The shape-shifting wishes of his personae are meant to break out into being, rather than to sacralize it. Accordingly, Jarrell compels his allegory toward the domain of form, which remains the truth that best modifies, and is best modified by, wishing. Frances C. Ferguson acknowledges the call of allegory underlying Jarrell's commitment to form, which levers the constraints of present narra tive against wishes for change: In Jarrell's [voice], everything suddenly seems to be a story.. .. [T]he story about stories has expanded through reduction, so that the combination of logical-positivistic truth and aesthetic limitation which we all occasionally, primitively, appeal to appears instantly foolish. Stories, as Jarrell says, want to do as they please. And although he rehearses most of the traditional jus tifications for stories in terms of human needs, he keeps formulating his story as if stories had lives of their own. They are a part of us, but other. (Ferguson 1983,164-65; emphasis in original) To briefly summarize my argument thus far: Jarrell's allegorizing is motivat ed by wished-for alternatives to whichever narrative foundations are present. The impetus for change that results is transitive, rather than punctuating the unfolding story; for example, as the arrival at a moral. Both "part of us, but other," the wishes that catalyze narrative change also require the on-going transformation of form in story and world. As Frances Ferguson reminds us, however, Jarrell's wishing for alternatives to existing form is driven by his personae's all-too-human experiences and needs. As I attempt to show in my analysis of his later poem, "The Tree," Jarrell's poetry benefits considerably from the disturbances and disruptions that the wishing of his process-allego ry requires. V Seeking a realm beyond narrativity and yet driven by the latter's limitations, the promise of quietude motivates Jarrell's allegory, even as the story being told defers the stasis upon which the resolution of the human/other story depends. Jarrell's allegory lives and dies—for Auden, must be resurrected—by the gerund of its own becoming. Human form migrates toward formlessness. Jarrell's allegory accordingly urges being beyond subjectivity, toward the syn chronous construction of multiple engagements converging at one point in space and time. Such a convergence is famously described, in Martin Heidegger's famous formulation in his 1955 letter to Ernst Jiinger entitled "The Question of Being", in terms of a lizard lying on a rock: When we say that the lizard is stretched out on the rock, we should cross through (durchstreichen) the word"iock,"to indicate that while what the lizard</page><page sequence="12">42 College Literature 39.2 [Spring 2012] is stretched out on is doubtless given him in some way [iirgendwie], [it] is not known [or recognized] as rock. The crossing-through does not only mean: something else is apprehended, as something else, but: it is above all, not acces sible as entity, (quoted in Derrida 1989,52-53; emphasis in original) As Jacques Derrida observes, Heidegger further denotes the lizard's position described in the passage above as "poor in the world" (weltarm), which Derrida elaborates upon thus: "The animal has and does not have a world" (1989, 48,50; emphasis in original). Accordingly, Derrida writes,"the animal has and does not have spirit" (51).The suture created by the lizard at rest— the rock warms the lizard's belly on a summer's day, but cannot be accessed as an entity by the lizard's being—accentuates rather than challenges weltarm, and necessitates the lizard's 'crossing out' as a primary being compared with human being. The rock, moreover, experiences a double crossing-through: it sustains yet a third order subordinated to the human, again apart from what the animal has not, with both lizard and rock remaining equally unable to access the human as entity. Heidegger's fable leaves the door slightly ajar for a subjectivity apart for the rock: only the rock, apparently, may know what a rock knows. Once and twice, animals and rocks are necessarily crossed out as entities in Heidegger's formulation; by contrast, humans can never be crossed or double-cmsM. In a posthumously published poem, "The Tree," Jarrell's persona wills his or her own crossing out, in an apparent challenge to Heidegger's imposition of weltarm as the exclusive domain of the animal and In the poem, an observed tree and a recently departed bird occupy alternative sites of being the persona juxtaposes so as to articulate his own wish for metamorphosis beyond the present: When I looked at the tree the bough was still shaking, So surely there was a bird That lit for an instant and left its motion To the dead wood. But the bough has ceased; what the tree remembers Who is there to tell? I have not changed, I have not forgotten, I am waiting still. (Jarrell 2002,190; emphasis in original) Here the poet's emphasis on the present absence ("surely") of the animal, the trace ("still shaking") of the trembling bough, initially seems to indicate the having-not having of weltarm, the dumb silence of animals and objects. Shifting tenses in the first line are transitive: simple past tense ("I looked") merges with the past continuous ("the bough was still shaking"), effecting a</page><page sequence="13">Stuart Christie 43 particular mood that declares the nothingness-and-being of the event not once (absent bird), but twice (dead 8S5).Yet the persona remains alone, standing as if fixed to the ground. His or her own memory of the event crafts another version of the suture from Heidegger's parable—the now-absent bird that just an instant ago was perching on the still-present tree. In the poem, the persona uses memory to restage the connection between bird and tree in a space and time now departed. As merely the instrument of reckoning, however, the persona's memory cannot access the shared entity their joining (bird on bough) has created. Moreover, apart from the apparent absence of the bird, the tree apparently has no subject or state it can share with the persona. (One has the impression it wouldn't own up, even if it could.) And, just now, the bird has also gone. In this doubled absence of entity, the persona of the "The Tree" crosses out his or her being not once, but twice; he or she merely waits for the change of becoming. Jarrell's persona is passive under the sign of the human, with no other being to tell or to recount what he or she has seen. The being-"I" of the human waits and, while waiting, is crossed out by the departed bird (human), and a second time by the present tree (human). Moreover, as a human, the persona of "The Tree" wills the return of the bird, fails, and is impoverished by the world in so failing. Here is an instance where the power of Jarrell's wishing cannot transform the story of non human being-in-world; instead, the persona waits to be transformed. Whereas the tree has and has not waited for the bird, the persona can only wait. Such waiting at once banishes the promise of a present fulfillment of desire, as well as creating forward conditions for its expression in some sub sequent wish the persona cannot as yet foresee. But, at least apparently, he or she does not and cannot change ("I have not changed"). In a challenge to Heidegger's weltarm, the departure of the bird not only smites the tree down as "dead wood" (not in itself: at least in the text the tree, as entity, still lives), but just as plausibly the persona, who will always still be waiting for the tree to tell. Here the animal's weltarm, attended by the tree, actually assumes the power of weltbildend, or world-forming. Their twinned entity intervenes so as to challenge the basis of the persona's ontology as a uniquely human and world-forming domain. In "The Tree" this doubled crossing-through of the hUfflftfl category by animals and non-sentient objects cannot be fully explained by Heidegger's model. As Derrida asks, Can one not say, then, that [Heidegger's] whole deconstruction of ontol ogy, as it is begun in Sein und Zeit [Being and Time] and insofar as it unseats, as it were, the Cartesian-Hegelian spiritus... is here threatened in its order,</page><page sequence="14">44 College Literature 39.2 [Spring 2012] its implementation, its conceptual apparatus, by what is called, so obscure ly still,"the animal"? (Derrick 1989, 57) I agree with Derrida that animals threaten, even as they would also seem to serve, the explicitly humanist hierarchy of dasein that Heidegger establishes. The persona of"The Tree" apparently wishes for a much more radical equiv alence than Heidegger's model can allow, between what the tree "remem bers" and what the persona has "not forgotten."Yet the humanist willfulness of Heidegger's dasein, like Jarrell's own motivating allegory for human unbe coming in the poem, also creates remarkable conditions for the metamor phosis of desire beyond Heidegger's requirement of weltbildend, of human being alone as world-forming. Ultimately, by accepting his or her double crossing-out, the hUfllfltt per sona in "The Tree" awaits the presence of being in the absence of human mastery. And like so many of Ovid's gods and figures, Jarrell's persona, by waiting for the other (the tree) to speak, comes to embody the silence of the tree not speaking. By the end of the poem, it seems clear that the persona has after all changed, and that present-absent wish of the persona presently describes two trees not-speaking, both waiting for a bird. By thus embracing stasis, Jarrell's persona wills his or her nothingness into being as the tree. Yet by deferring the actuality of the bird's return, metamorphosis occurs in the poem in the absence of the mastery human change typically wills as its own. As a tree, the hUfflftfl cannot will the bird to return; nor, indeed, can he write its return. Wishing as waiting thus achieves the transition as expectancy, beyond the passivity of stasis, toward a prospect of change as it is about to hap pen. Finally, the persona's desiring the tree to speak—an impossibility attrib utable to, indeed deriving from, his or her own silence—establishes an equiv alence that alters irrevocably the use of allegory as the humanist monopoly of weltbildend, or world-forming. The persona in "The Tree" seeks to share with the tree the absolute poverty of the bird's absence, in contrast to the ani mal's relative plenitude of spirit and world. In the bird's absence, only the trembling branch and the trembling persona remain. They tremble together; indeed, they would become the trembling.12 By embracing the poverty-in-world of rocks and trees, Jarrell's allegory stages its own dissolution as the welcome return to organic totality. Yet it also defers the stasis of such a return. Driven by the desire for change, Jarrell's persona wills his being beyond the human form and ponders being ("waiting") as a meaningful alternative to the present. As the rewriting of Heidegger's dasein, such an allegory requires, for Jarrell, the promise of wel come disappearance, as well as a sense of mourning for the already depart ed. The trick of reading Jarrell's transitivity therefore involves reading his</page><page sequence="15">Stuart Christie 45 allegory not only as the desire for change, but in abeyance of the allegory's object once changed. In Jarrell's poetry, animal forms, too, enjoy their pound of humanist flesh. The bird in "The Tree" smites the persona presently; its departure enables the persona's death to humanity as well as transformation, his or her legs rooting deep into the ground that waiting becomes. Jarrell's animals and non-sentient beings thus inhabit a radical negativity both of and beyond what we think of as human subjectivity. How can we distinguish between the persona and the object personified? They inhabit for us—making us, in fact, an us—the nec essary pivot in the formation of world consciousness Heidegger's weltbildend requires. We cannot imagine or write either ourselves or our being in the world without animals. (Or even insects: to think and wonder, for example, that future remembrance will understand this year, any year, as the one the common honey bee faced catastrophe. Unique to our humanity is that we require animals to feel the effects of change first.) Asserting the irreducibility of being to any particular and sovereign form, Jarrell's allegory questions weltbildend (world-forming) as a human monopoly. It also draws considerable force from the impoverished domain (1weltarm) it claims as its own animal or non-sentient legacy As we have seen, in Heidegger's hierarchy—and in "The Woman at the Washington Zoo" above—the being of things cannot exist without the weltarm of animals whose forms, in turn, beckon the desire and violence of human mastery. Just as often, however, Jarrell's allegories trap his human subjects within the dynamic of their becoming otherwise.13 And notably, while Jarrell's animals are necessarily trapped by weltbildend, they never signify the trap. Accordingly, they serve their human masters in allegorical terms, yet never instrumental ize mastery as a language lorded over another being. Animals never seek to speak the language of their masters. By ensuring that his allegory's human subjects are mastered as equally by change as are animals, Jarrell addresses the problem of mastery as constitutive across all ranks of being. Yet, I suspect Jarrell is also intrigued by the neces sary failure of the animal universe—much as Nietzsche was14—as an impos sible refuge from being and time. Morals given flesh, animals are impover ished by human predicaments to the extent that they draw power from those very same categories they would seek to question. For Jarrell to embrace ani mality therefore requires that he must abandon both a moral status for ani mals and the sine qua non animals fall into as a consequence of moralist pro jection, their derivative status as shadow-humans. (For his part, Nietzsche understood all too well, and celebrated the fact, that animals cannot in them selves convey morality as truth.) Rather, another shadow lurks behind the animal—the master holding its leash.</page><page sequence="16">46 College Literature 39.2 [Spring 2012] By so often linking animals to humans within a broader philosophical enquiry about the status of being, Jarrell questions humanist assumptions underlying the process of allegorizing—centrally, that the only allegories are human allegories—and seeks to evacuate allegorizing of weltbildend, of humanist primacy as world-forming. This urge in Jarrell toward dissolution of the anthropocentric is, I presume, what the tradition of criticism from Lowell to Updike to Bergman continues to find so disturbing. For his part, Jarrell grasped that humans master neither present desires, whose objects they recognize as their own, nor future desires, whose as yet undiscovered objects achieve form independently through creative acts of imagination.15 Accordingly, Jarrell typically rejects any claims for allegory imposing one par ticular sovereign embodiment over and against alternative forms and expres sions of being-in-world. Yet to hold fast to this antinomian principle as Jarrell seems to do— namely, that the very presence of animals defies the law of human mastery (iweltbildend), thereby creating forward space for post-human or human-ani mal subjectivities to emerge—necessarily imposes a false distinction in kind. The expression of any desire in whatever form, human and animal, necessi tates as an axiom the imposition of sovereignty over form. Accordingly, Jarrell's poems cannot resist helping themselves to animals; his poems, like his personae's desires, will do with animals as they please. In writing of animals, the desires of Jarrell's poetry therefore bring "animals" into being only nom inally; at one and the same moment, desires constrain and displace whatever it is animals actually are. Jarrell ultimately cannot reject the constructive power of humanist alle gory, however loosened it may be his vision, as the confining casement for alternative—notably, animal—forms. Accordingly, he never completely refutes the intrusion of humans looking into, so as to construct, animal being. Animals challenge human allegorizing as an exhaustive domain, but are never held entirely independent from it. In his commitment to allegory, at least, Jarrell always and perhaps reluctantly remains one of us. VI As we have seen, in "The Woman at the Washington Zoo" and "The Bronze David of Donatello" Jarrell showcases the motivating force of his allegories in the service of both narrative and symbol, whereby multiple readers encod ing ever-shifting surfaces may be united within the same interactive process. So too, as in "The Tree," the mastery that a localizing subjectivity might impose is perpetually displaced. Rather than seeking out the ontological sub stance underlying form, then, Jarrell is principally preoccupied with docu menting those accidents attending the emergence of form in a process of</page><page sequence="17">Stuart Christie 47 collective readership. Accidents crystallize form in a momentary utterance, sign, or event only to have their metaphorical "housing" (as poet A.V. Christie calls it) be shed altogether, revealing nothing.16 Somewhat paradoxically, Jerome Mazzaro describes this urge toward dis solution in Jarrell as redemptive. Embodying links between ontological dis placement and transformational being, Mazzaro argues that: JarreU's personae are always involved with efforts to escape engulfment, implosion, and petrification, by demanding that they somehow be miracu lously changed by life and art into people whose ontologies are psychical ly secure.The changes may allow them then to drop the mechanism by which in their relations they preserve themselves and to feel gratification in relat edness. (Ferguson 1983,99; emphasis in original) Mazzaro and I share the appreciation of Jarrell's miraculous allegorical mechanics, but to a differing consequence. In my view, Jarrell's allegories sus tain not the demand for ontological security "somehow," but generate per petual desires for change beyond the specific requirements of ontological security when expressed as particular formal demands. Jarrell's demands upon form are consistently foregrounded; but they never have as their goal the preservation of any existing form. Jarrell's "somehow" is always, in fact, a something required to change into something else. To "drop the mechanism" of desire, as Mazzaro puts it, would therefore require dropping change, beyond present form, as a motivating prospect. And this Jarrell's best writing can never allow. He willingly sacrifices present ontological security in favor of forward expressions of alternative being. This said, Jarrell was not a believer in the rolling out of a soft, imagistic pluralism for its own sake? With its stunning appreciation of punishment, Jarrell's poetry comes closer to Ovid than any other modern verse I can think of. Its profusion of forms signify not multiplicity alone, but variety in the ultimate interest of documenting abuses arising whenever and wherever power and authority are localized in a preferred form. At this point it is important to remind ourselves, moreover, that Ovid's personae are not born allegories as such—they arrive at a given form-in-being only after having passed through various phases co-articulating non-human and human states, and after having survived a violent process of being-transfer. The fact of sur viving such change does not justify violence for its own sake, but does occa sion the becoming of difference as a meaningful consequence. Accordingly, I do not entirely agree with the interpretation Michel Benamou provides, whereby Jarrell's allegorical outputs supersede their oper ative functionality: "Do not most of Ovid's changelings seem more truly themselves after their mutation?" (Ferguson 1983,242; emphasis in original). From my perspective, the answer to this question is no. Jarrell's use of alle</page><page sequence="18">48 College Literature 39.2 [Spring 2012] gory affirms the subject's metamorphosis as necessarily reflexive of its object and heedless of whatever arrival the changing object may subsequently expe rience. To change must always involve changing. VII To end, then, with being as becoming: it is a precondition of Jarrell's best work that once the desire for form—for allegory—has been baited, it has already been switched. Hence his allegory's extensive preoccupation with the inevitability of rebirth in forms transcending subjectivity-as-mastery. The descendant of Hawthorne in an American tradition of allegory, Jarrell's poems motivate change perpetually, as opposed to embracing outcomes designed to compensate for the alienation of being narrative imposes. Such, at least, appears to have been one signal distinction between Auden's and Jarrell's approaches to allegory, not only as pertains to the writing of desire but its expression (or lack) as sexuality. The operation of Jarrell's allegory is therefore best considered as the will ful suspension (we note the oxymoron) of a particularly human desire, idling in the search for quietude beyond subjectivity. That this proposition is itself vexing and tautological, the willfulness of no will, nevertheless enables the functional reading ofjarrell's allegory I have presented here. Embracing being otherwise, Jarrell challenges a humanist basis for Heidegger's poverty-in world as weltarm (uniquely attributed to animals and non-sentient beings) and toward a surfeit of signifying possibilities. Jarrell's use of allegory further requires his readers to question the motivations and processes of being as ontological necessities. And if, as George Boys-Stones has suggested, allegory is truly an ancient species of metaphor which has distinguished itself from mere rhetorical adornment by going places, by going someplace else far removed from an oratorical context, then Jarrell's allegories are super-charged (2003, 2). They offer, as William Empson once said of Donne's poetry, to take us into space. But with a difference: Jarrell's process-allegories shed the limitations of form only to return us to earth in the form of a re-visitation. His poems help read ers imagine the subjects they might have been and may well become, as opposed to the subjects they (and we) are. Eschewing the tragedy of the con ventional allegorical outcome, Jarrell chooses the eternity of a restless and inevitable reshaping apart from moral placement. And, having traversed the moral realm, his allegories are disturbed: they reject the tomb of form as unbecoming of becoming. At such taut and tenuous moments, manifold versions of form nevertheless populate the signifying field pleasurably, and in a remarkable absence of antagonism. Recognizing being reflexively, as the shared subject of becoming differently, allegories in Jarrell enliven the</page><page sequence="19">Stuart Christie 49 subject-in-process we know ourselves to be. To be able to write, as well as to read poetry at all, requires being human. Randall Jarrell's allegories nev ertheless urge us to imagine ourselves changing. We read his poetry and become. Notes My thanks to Jeremy Tambling, Wai Chee Dimock, Brian Abel Ragen and the reviewers of College Literature whose input on earlier drafts helped make the claims in this essay more sustainable. 1 Thanks to Brian Abel Ragen for steering me in the direction of this reference. 2 See Florian Hild's "Randall Jarrell and Ludwig Wittgenstein: Poetic Philosophy" for an interesting discussion about how the quietist premise—that philosophies serve therapeutic processes as well as epistemological ends—inhered in both the philosopher's and the poet's respective works, including "a shared distrust of systems," as well as how the domains of poetry and philosophy might be consid ered coextensive (Ferguson 2003,131). As Hild notes,Jarrell was influenced by early Wittgenstein (particularly the Tractatus), and referenced the philosopher's viewpoints in his diaries, notes, and the occasional poem. 3 See Ferguson 1983, 241-45. As if to challenge such an ends-oriented meta morphosis, Rebecca West remarked wryly: "I would have liked to become a man at the age of just under fifty, and would have felt myself simply doing something amus ing out of the pages of Ovid's Metamorphoses" (Heilbrun 2004,214). 4 Peter Singer identifies "speciesism" as "elevating membership of one particu lar species into a morally crucial characteristic" (Singer 1986, 6). Giorgio Agamben would, in turn, master mastery: "The anthropological machine no longer articulates nature and man in order to produce the human through the suspension and capture of the inhuman. The machine is . .. stopped;.. . [and] something for which we per haps have no name and which is neither animal nor man settles in between nature and humanity and holds itself in the mastered relation, in the saved night" (Agamben 2004,83). 5 Bergman quotes Arnold directly: "everything to be endured, nothing to be done" (Bergman 2004, 352). In contrast to Jarrell, Auden's poetry capably sustained a more stable heuristic for critics, by ensuring on-going correction and effective containment (as Auden saw it) of his homosexuality within the moral framework of an affirming Christian faith (Kirsch 2005, 31-32,130-32). 6 Gail McDonald suggests that Jarrell's work was consistently sentimentalized by New Critics, an association which served, over time, to feminize his poetry when compared with prevailing literary norms: "For Jarrell ... the agenda was to find a way to put romance, mystery, and sentiment (the stereotypes of a feminized sensibil ity) back into the mix of critical values. Jarrell's stance, Leslie Fiedler perceived, is that of a courageous, rescuing prince in a fairy tale; his princess, the loving reader, pos sesses that feminized sensibility" (McDonald 1998,8). See also Ferguson 2003,8-10. 7 Bookending Eisenhower's first term in office, which saw McCarthyite anti communist witch-hunts and the rise of television, were the devastating impact of</page><page sequence="20">50 College Literature 39.2 [Spring 2012] Nazi genocide in wartime and Alfred C. Kinsey's dataset concerning the sexual fan tasies of middle-American citizens. Jarrell's comprehension of the ethical significance of his own time, alongside the eventual onset of mental illness and depression, must be factored into any discussion of his turn toward allegory. See Pritchard (1991), especially the "Author's Introduction" and Chapter 6 ("A Country Life"). 8 Both poets enjoyed vernacular re-writings of myth as contemporary counter discourses to modernity. Auden advocated the novels of J. R. R. Tolkien, in particu lar, and both poets admired the Brothers Grimm and Rilke. Of Jarrell's particular debt to Rilke, Karl Shapiro wrote: "[L]ike Rilke, [Jarrell] is on both sides of the Rhine at once. The literary theme in Jarrell, and the one he has the most fun with, is the eternal battle of the Rhine, across which an Enlightenment attacks Nature, or vice versa" (Ferguson 1983,31). 9 Auden constructed what Kirsch calls "integrative metaphysics" to address the problems of what the body would wish for: sin and desire. Facing squarely his own modernist truth problem, and presaging postmodern challenges to narrative certain ty, Auden was not himself willing any longer to let his stories satisfy any and all wish es, save the moral certainties one wish in particular, the Anglo-Catholic, provided; see Kirsch 2005, xii-xiii. 10 When writing about his most formative influences, Jarrell turned directly from Auden to the Pauline gospels, and subsequently, to the life of St. Paul. For Jarrell, allegorizing was inevitably associated with law-breaking in the interests of greater enlightenment; see Pritchard 1990,132-33. For his part, Auden greatly pre ferred the scholastic emphasis of Augustine to the nominalism of Thomas Aquinas; see Kirsch 2005, 28. 11 When one compares, for example, Jarrell's "The Refugees" with Auden's "Musee des Beaux Arts," one observes readily how both poets'views concerning for mal representation may, in fact, align. Jarrell reads form ethically, as functional to being and event; Auden reads it as the lie giving forth the mystery of Godhead. From both viewpoints, the desire for metamorphosis almost always reveals progressivism as a lie, not only relative to the evaluation of succeeding event and being as potential ly better or more true (post hoc propter hoc), but also of precedent event and being as worse or false once superseded. The fact of change may be sudden, and its present newness compelling, but change in itself is never new. Accordingly, Jarrell makes the function of change his absolute,'and Auden remains skeptical of change as merely the impoverishment of an Absolute. 12 My assertion carries with it a claim of peacefulness not usually ascribed to Jarrell's last months of life. A critical orthodoxy emerged after Jarrell's death suggest ing, beyond reasonable allowances for his mental illness, that his death was a suicide. See Pritchard 1990, "Author's Introduction." 13 Richard Fein argues that Jarrell actively provokes the pressures and violence of his personae's becoming: "[he] at one and the same time incites and defeats his characters" (Ferguson 1983,152). 14 The incitement of humanity beyond present domestication, as well as the reinscription of animality as humanity's vital consequence, demonstrates Jarrell's debt</page><page sequence="21">Stuart Christie 51 to Nietzsche. See the Introduction to Acampora and Acampora 2004, and chapters by Gerd Schank and Vanessa Lemm. 15 Unlike his contemporary, Marianne Moore, Jarrell recognized that animals cannot fully escape from the allegories of their masters. Nor, like Wallace Stevens, did Jarrell fully trust that animal subjectivities might be perceived intelligently. 16 Ofjarrell's attraction to Ovid, poet A.V. Christie writes: "I guess God might reduce things for [Jarrell] whereas the lure of Ovid and myth and tale is that there's a wide and rich array of effects and details before you're eventually duped/disaffect ed by the same set of human plots. He's—like the jay—dazzled by the glitter of the many/shiny/things—and then with great disaffection finds it's the same old story" (correspondence with the author, 4 June 2005).
