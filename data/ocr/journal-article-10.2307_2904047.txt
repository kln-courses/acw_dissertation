<plain_text><page sequence="1">Through the Intricacies of "The Fourth Stage" to an Apprehension of Death and the King's Horseman Richard M. Ready It was no accident that, in awarding Wole Soyinka the 1986 Nobel Prize for literature, the awarding committee's citation should have especially noted his 1975 tragic drama Death and the King's Horseman. Its materials, its origin, and its resonances all confirm the world-stage stature of its author. Soyinka had long been familiar with the historical events in Nigeria on which his play is based (Gibbs 10), but it was not until his tenure at Churchill College, Cambridge, in 1973 and 1974 that the materials began to take shape in dramatic form. Soyinka's deep engagement with courage was stirred by a bust of Churchill himself, and in a very short time he had given the story of the chief interrupted in his duties the particular dimension that he as a playwright wanted (Katrak 105). That dimension includes obvious elements of tragedies by admired dramatists of the Western tradition, particularly Shakespeare and the Greeks. The language which enacts the drama of the Elesin Oba's greatest challenge-that of accompanying his king through the transition to the world of the ancestors-this language is as poetically rich and symbolic as any found in Shakespeare. And the very action itself, that of a man's failing to act in accordance with a role assigned him by the gods, is suggestive of the plot of Oedipus the King, the model for Aristotle's idea of a tragedy. Yet, though in Death and the King's Horseman Soyinka makes use of ingredients familiar from Western tragedy, his shaping of these materials calls for an interpretation different from that which perhaps governs most modern interpretations of Shakespeare and the Greeks. Soyinka wishes to ensure that a play such as Death and the King's Horseman affirms the ritual origins of tragedy. In his essay "The Black American Literature Forum, Volume 22, Number 4 (Winter 1988) ? 1988 Indiana State University</page><page sequence="2">712 Richard M. Ready Fourth Stage," on the tragic element in Yoruba art, he seeks to demonstrate that in a tragic situation both the challenging figure the tragic hero-and the challenged order-nature, society-are equally to be respected and that each must play its role if man is to experience life as it should be experienced: integrally and wholly. There is a tendency for the modern viewer of a play such as Oedipus the King to see only an emphasis on the individual figure who challenges and fails and is thus to be admired for his "tragicness"; that is, pitied for his misfortune. The modern, rational view is to admire Oedipus, to focus on the individual. This view tends to remove the play from its ritual origins, from the sense that the community can tolerate its heroes only if they "fail" and are sacrificed. In a ritualistic emphasis, such figures emerge as heroes for themselves and for the community. "The Fourth Stage" provides readers and viewers of Death and the King's Horseman the means to see how Soyinka is reshaping the Western tragedic tradition. The essay is a delineation of the elements of Yoruba aesthetic forms and their governing deities. In particular, Soyinka asserts the dominance of Ogun in defining Yoruba tragedy. He finds it helpful to note parallels and differences in Yoruba tragedy as it originates in Ogun and Greek tragedy as it originates, according to Nietzsche, in the amalgam of Dionysus and Apollo. Soyinka accepts Nietzsche's combined deities as the paradigm for the Western tragic figure, but for his purposes adds to that duality in a significant way. A comparison of Yoruba and Greek finds Ogun similar to Dionysus, Apollo, and Prometheus: "Ogun, for his part, is best understood in Hellenic values as a totality of the Dionysian, Apollonian and Promethean virtues" ("Stage" 141). The addition of Prometheus points to two important elements of Yoruba tragedy: the serving of community in the paradoxical act of "saving" oneself and the prominence of understanding among the gifts provided the community. Soyinka speaks in "The Fourth Stage" of how Ogun, the model for the tragic victim of Yoruba tragedy, is "resorbed within universal Oneness, the Unconscious, the deep black whirlpool of mythopoeic forces" in order to "understand its nature" (153). In an earlier tragedy, The Road (1965), Soyinka offers the possibility that the understanding retrieved from the abyss Ogun braves is more experiential than articulable; nonetheless, it is clear the tragic figure undertakes his challenge in order to "emerge wiser, powerful from the draught of cosmic secrets, organizing the mystic and technical forces of earth and cosmos to forge a bridge for his companions to follow" (153-54).</page><page sequence="3">Through the Intricacies of "The Fourth Stage" 713 Ogun is "the first actor-for he led the others-. . . first suffering deity, first creative energy, the first challenger, and conqueror of transition" (145). Ogun is revered in Yoruba mythology for his having responded to the "primordial disquiet" in "the Yoruba psyche" of a "primal severange"; in other words, man's sense of alienation. Ogun conquers this alienation in a defiant descent to Earth to "battle with immense chaotic growth which had sealed off reunion with man" (144). Ogun, in short, provides the model for the Soyinkan tragic figure. As a set of characteristics, Ogun is "god of creativity, guardian of the road, god of metallic lore and artistry" (140n). The "artifact" that symbolizes Ogun, namely iron ore, speaks to his power as "cleaver and welder of life." He is an "alliance of disparities" (146). The energy with which he braves the abyss is accompanied by a "re-creative intelligence" (150). But dominating this Dionysian/Apollonian combination is "the infinite will of the Promethean spirit" (160). Indeed, the will so informs the Ogunian gesture that the Apollonian element, what Soyinka calls "aesthetic serenity" (141), is, if it is possible for a paradoxical combination to be separated, more after-fact than element. When the tragic act passes its moment of accomplishment, or in passing through its moment of achievement, Soyinka discovers a sense of resolution characteristic of the Yoruba god Obatala. That is, the creative, willful, revolutionary act has become the aesthetic fact. In the destructive/creative dynamic's operating, this transfiguration occurs in a virtually indivisible instant. As Ogun gives way to Obatala, creativity gives way to creation. Working his way along this line of thinking familiar from Nietzsche, Soyinka makes a significant departure. The Obatalan spirit functions differently from the Apollonian. The gods are not equivalent. The achievement of Obatala is not "illusion," which Nietzsche claims for Apollonian serenity (33), but "inner essence" ("Stage" 141). Thus, in terms of the whole tragic challenge, the successful Ogun figure-successful, that is, in keeping himself intact while undergoing disintegration-is revealed in his true being at such a tragic moment and is not represented, or symbolized, or interpreted for the participating community. The only appropriate mode for this revelation is music, shared by the central figure and his votaries: The true tragic music, unearths cosmic uncertainties which pervade human existence, reveals the magnitude and power of creation, but above all creates a harrowing sense of omni-directional vastness where the creative Intelligence resides and prompts the soul to futile exploration. The senses</page><page sequence="4">714 Richard M. Ready do not at such moments interpret myth in their particular concretions; we are left only with the emotional and spiritual values, the essential experience of cosmic reality. (148) The general principles of Yoruba tragedy outlined in "The Fourth Stage" are of great help in the analysis of a specific Soyinka play such as Death and the King's Horseman. The play is marked by a feature distinctive in the history of Western tragedy: two conspicuous candidates for tragic victim and two deaths of moment. By the play's end, Olunde, son of Elesin and heir to the title of king's horseman, commands the role of victim from a faltering father and emerges as the Ogun figure. But we who watch this unusual reversal of roles also wonder whether there is a tragic dimension to Elesin's death, undertaken through suicide once he realizes his son has chosen to substitute for him in braving the transition between life and death. A sampling of critical responses to this question discovers for us a play that ends in puzzlement and ambiguity. It seems possible to read the play in such a way that both deaths are meaningless, given the irreversible rupture in Yoruba affairs caused by the British presence at the historical time of the action. Or we can be plunged into the timeless, metaphysical qualities of the drama and consider only whether Elesin and Olunde are true to the one code they call their own. Mark Ralph-Bowman, for instance, finds that Olunde's act is redemption enough for Elesin's failure to enter transition. Believing that Soyinka is not "portraying the collapse of a cosmology" (84), he terms Olunde's death "a significant and uncompromising affirmation ... ." (88). Ketu H. Katrak, on the other hand, is uncertain of the redemptive nature of either death: "Olunde's death at first strikes us as wasteful.... At the moment when [lIyaloja, leader of the market women,] reveals Olunde's dead body to Elesin, both father and son emerge as tragic figures-Elesin for outliving his son, and Olunde for dying before his time" (99). For Katrak, "tragic" appears to mean unfortunate, at an extreme from Ogunian heroics. In the midst of uncertainty and ambiguity, "The Fourth Stage" affords us a way through to understanding. The essay clearly invites us to see Elesin and Olunde as contrasting figures: Elesin as failed Ogun and Olunde as successful one. The Ogun figure always acts on a cosmic scale. Despite the obvious factor of the British in the drama, "The Fourth Stage" encourages us not to read what is required of the Yoruba heroic figure as if it were written in an alien hand. We are not to accept the "ghostly" illusion that Elesin unfortunately accepts.</page><page sequence="5">Through the Intricacies of "The Fourth Stage" 715 The essay makes clear how Elesin is not an Ogun figure by carefully contrasting the god himself with gods who are not Ogun. These gods are Obatala and Sango, "god of lightning and electricity" ("Stage" 15In). In modeling his actions, Elesin confuses, first, Ogun with Obatala, and second, after his misstep, Ogun with 5ango. Act 1 of Death and the King's Horseman establishes the confusion between Ogun and Obatala. Elesin mistakes creation for creativity, supplants accomplishing the fact with the accomplished fact. His confusion is all the more deluded in Soyinka's view because, unlike Apollo in the Nietzschean scheme of tragedy, Obatala represents not illusion but essence. That Elesin would claim for himself the Obatalan achievement of pure essence when in fact he has not even entered the Ogunian torture is the greatest of illusions. We see Elesin make this claim in his transports over his new bride. When Elesin sees the beautiful young girl, just after the market women have ceremonially robed him, he says: And let me tell you, women- I like this farewell that the world designed, Unless my eyes deceive me, unless We are already parted, the world and I, And all that breeds desire is lodged Among our tireless ancestors. Tell me friends, Am I still earthed in that beloved market Of my youth? Or could it be my will Has outleapt the conscious act and I have come Among the great departed? (Death 18) To understand how Elesin's premature serenity contradicts the requirements for an Ogun figure, it is necessary to note in "The Fourth Stage" how the achievement of Obatala succeeds and caps that of Ogun: Within the mystic summons of the chasm the protagonist actor (and every god-suffused choric individual) resists, like Ogun before him, the final step towards complete annihilation. From this alone steps forward the eternal actor of the tragic rites, first as the unresisting mouthpiece of the god, uttering visions symbolic of the transitional gulf, interpreting the dread power within whose essence he is immersed as agent of the choric will. Only later, in the evenness of release from the tragic climax, does the serene self-awareness of Obatala reassert its creative control. He, the actor, emerges still as the mediant voice of the god, but stands now as it were beside himself, observant, understanding, creating. At this stage is known to him the sublime aesthetic joy, not within Nietzsche's heart of original oneness but in the distanced celebration of the cosmic struggle. This resolved aesthetic serenity is the link between Ogun's tragic art and Obatala's plastic beauty. (142-43)</page><page sequence="6">716 Richard M. Ready The image of life offered by the young girl deludes Elesin into believing that he has achieved "the serene self-awareness of Obatala." When he speaks of how his "will / Has outleapt the conscious act," it is as if he "stands ... beside himself, observant, understanding, creating." But he is not yet creation, for he has not yet created. He participates not in the "sublime aesthetic joy" of Obatalan completeness; rather he remains in "Nietzsche's heart of original oneness." Nietzsche describes this state symbolic of Dionysus as one in which "each individual becomes not only reconciled to his fellow but actually at one with him" (23). Nietzsche further remarks of the Dionysiac figure: "No longer the artist, he has himself become a work of art . . ." (24). As suggestive as this state is of achievement, it is nonetheless in the Yoruba order of things an illusion, for it leaves out the matter of the will. The exercise of the will stamps the individual as an individual, and Elesin's delusion is in believing that his generic self, the self he shares in common with others, is the same as his individual, unique self. Through the assertion of this specific, individual self in the Ogunian act of braving transition, Elesin would have "distanced" himself and emerged from that generic self which, by its very nature, is given over only to life, to perpetuation. In glimpsing his bride-to-be, Elesin falls into the grip of the generic in its most basic function: generation, perpetuation. The "fatal" error for Elesin is to believe that he is special by virtue of his generic self. Since the Yoruba cosmology equates life, death, and being unborn, an identification with the generic in life could convince Elesin that he is already with the dead, beyond transition, and that the awful step required to cross over into the other world has somehow been negotiated. But Soyinka cautions us in "The Fourth Stage" in this matter: Life ... contains within it manifestations of the ancestral, the living and the unborn. All are vitally within the intimations and affectiveness of life .... Yet the Yoruba does not for that reason fail to distinguish between himself and the deities, between himself and the ancestors, between the unborn and his reality, or discard his awareness of the essential gulf that lies between one area of existence and another. (144) Elesin feels himself linked to the world of the dead. He is there not by virtue of an act but by elision. His name names him- Elesin/elision-in a way he had not suspected. Elesin does not achieve "triumph over subsumation through the agency of the will" (149). He confuses "absorption" with "resorption." He mistakes a oneness antecedent to the willful, creative act with a oneness (Obatalan serenity) after the creative</page><page sequence="7">Through the Intricacies of "The Fourth Stage" 717 act. He refuses to narrow himself to his individuation and then release that unique self in order to achieve a transfigured oneness after the act. Soyinka describes in "The Fourth Stage" what the successful Ogun figure achieves: It is to look into the very heart of... phenomena. To fashion a bridge across it was not only Ogun's task but his very nature, and he had first to experience, to surrender his individuation ... to the fragmenting process; to be resorbed within universal Oneness, the Unconscious, the deep black whirlpool of mythopoeic forces, to immerse himself thoroughly within it, understand its nature and yet by the combative value of the will to rescue and re-assemble himself and emerge wiser, powerful from the draught of cosmic secrets, organizing the mystic and the technical forces of earth and cosmos to forge a bridge for his companions to follow. (153-54) Not until the imprisoned Elesin is forced to respond to the taunts of Iyaloja in act 5 does he come to recognize the character of his failure. Then we see how the British officers who interrupted his ceremony of transition have been indirect agents of the misstep. Elesin says: It is when the alien hand pollutes the source of will, when a stranger force of violence shatters the mind's calm resolution, this is when a man is made to commit the awful treachery of relief, commit in his thought the unspeakable blasphemy of seeing the hand of the gods in this alien rupture of the world. I know it was this thought that killed me, sapped my powers and turned me into an infant .... (Death 69) As an "infant," Elesin has been following the "trailing cord" that leads back to the womb, to merging, to oneness (18). As the king's horseman, he was to have emerged from merging, much as a piece of relief sculpture emerges from the rock in which it is bound. What unfortunately happened, according to Elesin, was that under pressure of the presence of the white man, his generic self, what Katrak calls "the deeper springs of life within him, the force of his blood tying him to other human beings and to the earth" (89), rushed to the fore, relieving his unique identity of its responsibility through absorption in a group identity. It is as if the material out of which the piece of sculpture is emerging were to rise up and absorb the delineated individual figure. Whereas Elesin was called on to be the surrogate for the community, he instead allowed his communal, generic self to substitute for his unique being. By virtue of its extenuation, the generic self could appear to have "acted," carrying Elesin through transition. Having failed to act when he should have, Elesin does act at the end of the play in the face of Olunde's substitution for him. He strangles himself with his own chains. His suicide raises the</page><page sequence="8">718 Richard M. Ready possibility that he has at last achieved the Ogunian act. To determine if this is possible requires a brief exposition of Yoruba time as defined by Soyinka in "The Fourth Stage." A basic assumption guiding our response to Death and the King's Horseman is that, as Katrak puts it, "According to traditional Yoruba belief, thirty days after the king's death his chief horseman ... must die in order to accompany his sovereign into the next world" (88). Yet nowhere in the play is anything said about thirty days. The closest the text comes to declaring this delimited period of time is when Olunde tells Jane Pilkings, wife of the British District Officer, ". . . my father has been dead in my mind for nearly a month" (Death 57). When the Pilkingses first inquire about what is to occur, their servant Joseph tells them, "It is native law and custom. The King die last month. Tonight is his burial. But before they can bury him, the Elesin must die so as to accompany him to heaven" (28). In the Western sense of time as accretion, as linear, Elesin and the community approach a deadline which, if not met, will never come again. But as Soyinka says, ". . . continuity for the Yoruba operates ... through the cyclic concept of time" ("Stage" 145), and "the Yoruba is not, like the European man, concerned with the purely conceptual aspects of time." Time is "no abstraction" (144), as we can tell from the concrete terms Joseph uses. In the cyclic Yoruba time scheme, Elesin is always facing his moment. It is not an abstracted node in the continuum of time to be gotten past. Once he has done his duty, the honor left behind will be proof of how he is, as an ancestor, always facing the great moment by virtue of having faced it once. From the point of view of Yoruba time, one acts for all time, and in failing to recognize that he "exists simply to die" (Gates 169), Elesin is unable to redeem himself through his suicide at the end. The key to understanding Elesin at the end of the drama is also the key to the distinctiveness of Death and the King's Horseman as Soyinkan tragedy. If before his decisive misstep Elesin is an Obatalan figure who fancies himself Ogun, he is after that moment, in act 5, a figure modeled on the god Sango. "The tragic actor for the future age (already the present for Europe) is that neo-technic ancestor Sango . . ." ("Stage" 150-51), says Soyinka, presumably implying that the future will have eliminated its supposed need for tragedy. Why is it that "we will not find the roots of tragedy in the Mysteries of Sango"? His fate is limited. It stems ... from the principle of a preliminary self-destruction, represented ... in the blind ignorant destruction of his own flesh and blood.... Sango is an anthropomorphic deity; his history revolved around petty tyranny; his self-destruction was the violent, central explosion from ego-inflation....</page><page sequence="9">Through the Intricacies of "The Fourth Stage" 719 The "terror and pity" of Sango is undeniable, only it is the "terror and pity" of human disavowal for that new disciple standing on the edge of the sublimating abyss already subdued by Ogun. (151) Elesin's suicide is mere "self-destruction," the result of an "ego- inflation" we have already discovered. Though there is "terror and pity" in Sango's death, it is evident from Soyinka's self-conscious use of these Aristotelian terms that any tragic form, even the Greek, is deficient if its focus is mainly on the "explosion" of the individual after an isolating period of suffering. In act 5 we see an Elesin who only suffers, thus giving to the drama that character of "Passion" that Soyinka says originates in Sango (151). And in the extent to which tragedy as "Passion" is tragedy without action, we can gauge the critical difference between Soyinka and the traditional Western masters of the form: Suffering cancels the opaque pleasure of human existence; suffering, the truly overwhelming suffering of Sango, of Lear, of Oedipus, this suffering hones the psyche to a finely self-annihilating perceptiveness and renders further action futile and, above all, lacking in dignity. And what has the struggle of the tragic hero been, after all, but an effort to maintain that innate concept of dignity which impels to action only to that degree in which the hero possesses a true nobility of spirit? (154) Immediately upon this declaration of the error of substituting suffering for spirit, Soyinka confirms that the ascendancy of Sango over Ogun follows naturally, as in Elesin's case, upon the earlier confusion of Obatala for Ogun: "At such moments [of suffering, the Sango figure] is close to the acceptance and wisdom of Obatala in which faith is rested, not on the self, but on a universal selfhood to which individual contributions are fundamentally meaningless" (154). In much of act 5, especially in his conversation with Pilkings, Elesin deems himself an Obatalan "creation," namely the black "victim," by constantly addressing not Pilkings the individual but rather the officer's "universal selfhood"; that is, his "ghostly" whiteness. There remains the matter of whether Olunde's death fits into the Soyinkan tragic view as outlined in "The Fourth Stage." In its sheer willfulness, Olunde's suicide stands out as an Ogunian achievement. Not only that, from his first appearance in act 4 Olunde represents that balance and arrangement of Ogun and Obatala that mark the successful bridging of transition. In arguing with Jane Pilkings, he displays spirited feeling and cool control. Indeed, his control, at first, might give evidence of an "accommodation towards the modern world" ("Stage" 155) as a result of his English medical education, a kind of scientific detachment. Detachment does</page><page sequence="10">720 Richard M. Ready pertain, but only as a portent of the serenity, the healing that comes after a rupture Olunde sees as a foregone conclusion. There is no "exclusion of tragic myth" in Olunde's consciousness (156). We must be careful not to be deceived. "The placid surface of the process of healing for spiritual or social rupture is mistaken for the absence of the principles of psychic experience that went into the restoration" (156). There is much beneath the surface in Olunde. Whether his act has community value is another matter. Was his act too late, coming as it did after Elesin's delay? Katrak feels that the play "ends with the assertion of life through the image of the unborn in the last line of the play" but that "the future of the community, which lies in the hands of the unborn, is shrouded in uncertainty" (100). Despite the ambiguity in this judgment, a close reading of the end of the play reveals that the idea of "too late" applies only to Elesin and not to Olunde. Iyaloja says over Elesin's body, "He is gone at last into the passage but oh, how late it all is. His son will feast on the meat and throw him bones" (Death 76). And when Elesin's Praise-Singer voices his final thoughts, in the voice of the dead king, he corroborates a valued role for Olunde. He is importuning Elesin to whisper his message to the supposed "horse" dead at his feet: "There lies the swiftest ever messenger of a king, so set me free with the errand of your heart" (74). In some fashion Olunde is to form the necessary link in transition. Hence his act is appropriately restorative. In the context of "The Fourth Stage" there is no question about the value of Olunde's act. Its possible foolhardiness amounts to the very hubris Ogunian bravery requires. For his community, Olunde commits the great "offence ... against nature" ("Stage" 156) of dying before his father, a tragic event among the Yoruba (Katrak 105). Olunde's "rupture is ... one aspect of the destructive-creative unity." In losing himself he paradoxically saves his people. Seen from the communal, ritualistic point of view, his individual act is tragic in a positive sense, for "offences even against nature may be part of the exaction by deeper nature from humanity of acts which alone can open up the deeper springs of man and bring about a constant rejuvenation of the human spirit" (156). Nature is acting in ways through Olunde that only his will can bring him to understand. "Nature ... benefits by such broken taboos, just as the cosmos does by demands made upon its will by man's cosmic affronts. Such acts of hubris compel the cosmos to delve deeper into its essence to meet the human challenge" (156). Under the impetus, then, of Soyinka's dramatic theory, we are encouraged to admire Olunde for his enactment of Ogun's unique assertion: "Ogun</page><page sequence="11">Through the Intricacies of "The Fourth Stage" 721 not only dared to look into transitional essence but triumphantly bridged it with knowledge, with art, with vision and the mystic creativity of science-a total and profound hubristic assertiveness that is beyond any parallel in Yoruba experience" (157). Looking carefully at Death and the King's Horseman through the lens of "The Fourth Stage" we can see that Soyinka has constructed a powerful drama of human possibility. In our responses to Elesin and Olunde we must not be blinkered, as is Elesin, into believing that the presence of the British alters the essential human requirement of seeing one's duty clearly. In the Praise-Singer's words to Elesin about their forebears, we should take the warning that Elesin does not: In their time the world was never tilted from its groove .... In their time the great wars came and went, the little wars came and went; the white slavers came and went, they took away the heart of our race, they bore away the mind and muscle of our race. The city fell and was rebuilt; the city fell and our people trudged through mountain and forest to found a new home but ... our world was never wrenched from its true course. (10) A community secured by the wills of its leaders will outlast all physical assaults. Elesin may earn our sympathy for his own supposed hubristic act, that of loving life more than he should, but because the taboo he breaks is in consonance with nature-that is, an assertion of the generic self, and not a challenge to it-, the figure we see at the end has lost all claim to being a tragic victim and indeed to being a man. His corpse is a mere "physical assault." Virginia Union University Richmond, Virginia Works Cited Gates, Henry Louis, Jr. "Being, the Will, and the Semantics of Death."
