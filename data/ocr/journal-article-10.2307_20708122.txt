<plain_text><page sequence="1">OF MASKS AND MYTHS James R. Duncan and Carol Diaz-Granados ABSTRACT A rare Missouri pictograph provides the first two-color, two-dimensional example of a regional artifact group?the long-nosed god maskettes. These ear ornaments have been found in an area encompassing at least 10 states. The pictograph and related myths (oral traditions) offer new insight into the symbolism that surrounds these ear ornaments. We also describe a long-sequestered pair of copper maskettes and other relevant artifacts and suggest how these representations may have figured into the general socioeconomics of western Mississippian groups. We explore the interrelationships of artifact attributes with a common theme found in the oral traditions of the central Mississippi and Missouri river valleys and southeastern areas where the ear ornaments have been found. Correlations connect the masks, the myths, and the economic structure, all of which worked together to play a major role in the development of complex societies and their far-reaching ex change networks. Introduction In this article we discuss the symbolism of a group of prehistoric artifacts, under the premise that artifacts were part of the same whole in which oral tradition played a major role. We argue that research into available oral traditions of lin guistically related groups can at least preliminarily connect artifacts with these oral traditions. This approach, basically that of interpretation, agrees with the position expressed by Watson et al.: "If archaeological material is recognizably primarily and deliberately symbolic?as many grave goods are, for example? then interpretations of past belief systems are possible... .Materials that are most probably symbolic thus provide the best data for inferring past belief systems" (1984:274). We propose that the widespread distribution of long-nosed god maskettes as well as other long-nosed god depictions, where the entire figure is represented, is related to and supported by an oral tradition that describes a specific set of characters. We also believe that this interrelationship between artifacts and oral tradition can be partially reconstructed. To suggest that specific artifact types can be linked to an oral tradition, to infer completeness to a group of objects which heretofore have largely been viewed as isolated, amenable only to description, is an approach that is gaining acceptance by scholars (Brown 1989; Hall 1989,1991; Kelly 1991; Brown and Kelly 1996). Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 25, No. 1 ? 2000 by The University of Iowa</page><page sequence="2">2 James R. Duncan and Carol Diaz-Granados It is a logical progression in our study of cultural material remains. It is, in a sense, a Boasian approach tempered by decades of accumulated ethnographic knowledge and the cognitive tools to link oral tradition, that is storytelling, with the cultural material record. Although proposed connections between artifacts and oral tradition of American Indian groups will not be made without criticism, we believe it is possible, at least in part, to reconstruct and interpret these cul tural materials. The Dhegihan Siouan, Chiwere Siouan, other Siouan-speaking groups, Hidatsa, Crow, Lakota, Mandan, as well as neighboring Caddo, Pawnee, and Central Al gonkian groups (Bailey 1995:284; Bowers 1950:16-20; Lowie 1993:8; Meyer 1977:6-7; Radin 1948:11-16), shared a core set of themes in their social and religious beliefs, as well as various agricultural practices. These are known to have become manifest in their oral traditions. Vehik (1993:231) suggests Dhegihan Siouan origins as including, in part, an amalgamation of Late Mississippian groups from along the Mississippi River between the Ohio and Missouri rivers. Associ ated iconography is found among the five "cognate" groups of Dhegihan speak ers (Osage, Omaha, Kansa, Ponca, Quapaw), who are so closely related that their languages "have hardly differentiated" (Fletcher and La Flesche 1992:35). The discovery of a Missouri pictograph site with diagnostic iconographies, along with the opportunity to examine a pair of Illinois long-nosed god maskettes from a private collection, initiated a quest to explain their possible function in the development of western Mississippian societies. Merging of artifacts, in this case, the pictograph and the ear ornaments, and oral tradition provides an inter pretation of these enigmatic symbols that is both dynamic and plausible. Long-Nosed God Maskettes As noted by Williams and Goggin (1956) and Hall (1991), a number of masks are known from various localities from as far west as eastern Oklahoma, as far east as northern Florida, north into Iowa and Wisconsin, and south into Missis sippi and Louisiana (Figure 1). There is an apparent concentration in the central Mississippi Valley area (Diaz-Granados 1993:330; Kelly 1991:73). The human head ear ornaments found to date are manufactured from shell, copper, or bone, but it is possible that others were created of more perishable materials such as wood or fiber. Some of the ear ornaments have a long nose, others have a short nose. Short-nosed examples are depicted on the large stone pipe called "Big Boy" from the Craig Mound at Spiro. The maskettes were presumably held in place by a string tied to the small perforations on the sides of the artifact, the string passing through the pierced ear lobe and the loop being secured by a peg on the back of the ear lobe (Brown 1996:522). The first recorded example of a long-nosed god maskette (Figure 2) was found in 1869 during the destruction of Big Mound near the St. Louis riverfront (Wil liams and Goggin 1956:7,19). In this example, the nose appears to have broken off, but we think?for reasons detailed below?that the nose was intentionally cut or bent. Since the discovery of the copper maskettes at Big Mound, 13 other</page><page sequence="3">Of Masks and Myths 3 Figure 1. Distribution map showing states where long-nosed god maskettes have been found. examples have been found in close proximity to Cahokia. Of the 15 total from the Cahokia area, 11 are made of marine shell, four are of copper, and one is made of bone (Kelly 1991:73). The ear ornaments have often been found in pairs adjacent to a human skull. They probably portray a specific figure or pair of figures because they all have essentially the same facial features: (1) cleft headdress/hair with horizontal band, (2) round, dot-in-circle eyes, and (3) extended nose. Most of the maskettes also have a shield or mask-like shape and two small holes on either side of the headband, as noted above, presumably to allow their attachment to the ears with a string or twine. Using Hall's adapted doctrine of Uniformitarianism (1997:xi), some general statements can be made on the bases of their uniformity of appear ance, their association with human mortuaries, and their relatively widespread distribution: 1. They were part of an extensive exchange system. 2. Their burial locations or associations are demonstrative of social position. 3. They represent a specific set of beings found in oral traditions recorded in numerous ethnographic accounts (Duncan and Diaz-Granados 1996). The "Meppen" Maskettes The two Meppen maskettes (Figures 3,4), fragile but in remarkably good condi tion, were excavated by the late collector, William Fecht. Fecht, a native of the Alton, Illinois, area, spent much of his adult life collecting and digging artifacts</page><page sequence="4">4 James R. Duncan and Carol Diaz-Granados Figure 2. Copper long-nosed god maskette from Big Mound, St. Louis, Missouri (drawn from photo in Williams and Goggin 1956:10). in west-central Illinois. While still a teenager, Fecht was befriended by Walter Wadlow. Wadlow, who was a respected avocational archaeologist, took Fecht with him on several of his excavations in west-central Illinois. Two of the sites Fecht collected and dug are the Snyders site and the Meppen Mounds in west central Illinois (L. Blake, personal communication). The Meppen Mounds in eastern Calhoun County along the Illinois River are also known as the Hazelhorst, Baalman, and Pehm mound groups (Sampson and Esarey 1993:458). Unfortunately, Fecht's excavation of the pair of maskettes is lacking in docu mentation and was carried out under questionable conditions. According to Fecht (1968), these copper ear ornaments were situated on either side of the head of an adult male buried on his back in an extended position, 1 m south of a "stone box" or "vault" feature. Reportedly, the copper salts from the maskettes had preserved a section of a long, thin hair braid and a piece of the scalp with a portion of the ear. Also found by the side of the head was a large, barrel-shaped bead manufac tured from a marine shell. The bead is 2.7 cm long, with a central diameter of 1.3 cm. When Fecht excavated the ear ornaments, the nose on the larger of the two was bent, accordion-fashion, in four places. Unfortunately, Fecht straightened the nose, but one can still see the creases where the nose was originally bent. It is this bent nose that kindled our curiosity and prompted our investigation. Each maskette was manufactured from two pieces of hammered sheet copper, and both are similar to other copper long-nosed god maskettes found in the east ern United States. The shield-shaped faces are approximately .65 mm thick, with circular eyes, notched foreheads, and slit mouth. The two maskettes are similar but not identical. The smaller maskette is 6.1 cm high and 5.2 cm wide. The cleft at the forehead is .3 cm wide and 1.2 cm in depth, and the edges were carefully rounded. The head band, indicated by a repouss? groove, is 1.8 cm from the top of the head and is indented .2 cm at the sides. A .15-cm hole was drilled on either side of the head band, presumably to attach a cord or string. The "dot-in-circle"</page><page sequence="5">Of Masks and Myths 5 Figure 4. The close relative locations of the Meppen site in Illinois and the Mis souri pictograph site.</page><page sequence="6">6 James R. Duncan and Carol Dlaz-Granados eyes are 1 cm in diameter and have a prominent "punched in" pupil .2 cm in diameter. The mouth is a deep slit 1 cm in length. Riveted to the face is a sheet copper nose .8 mm thick, 22 cm long, and 3.8 cm wide at the broadest part. The nose is carefully attached with three or more rivets, 1 mm in diameter, ham mered and ground so that they do not project and are not easily seen. The larger maskette is 6.2 cm high and 5.2 cm wide. The cleft is 1.3 cm deep and .3 cm wide. The eyes are 1.1 cm wide with prominent, centrally punctated pupils .2 cm wide. The mouth is 1.1 cm wide. The nose is .8 mm thick, 22.4 cm long, and 3.8 cm wide. Like the first maskette, the nose is neatly riveted to the shield-shaped face. Both ear ornaments show a considerable amount of wear, and a carefully riv eted patch has been placed just above the nose on both to repair what was pre sumably a stress crack in that location. The smaller mask has the patch on the front, the larger mask on the back. The corners of the patches have been care fully rounded and the 1.2-mm rivets are skillfully manufactured. The noses are riveted to a raised area, carefully indented to the front along a vertical midline (Figure 5). This was done in repouss? (hammered from the back). Once raised, it was then thinned side to side and the edge ground until a slit for the nose was made. The nose was meticulously affixed with 1-mm-diameter copper rivets passing from one side of the nose to the other side, and both sides were neatly hammered. Careful examination of the larger maskette reveals the crease marks from the bending of the nose. The tip, 20.2 cm from the face, was bent to the right. The second bend to the left was 17.8 cm from the face; the third bend was made to the right at 12.5 cm from the face, and the final bend was to the left at 8.5 cm from the face. Similar bending or "shortening" of the nose is represented in a minimum of two depictions from Spiro: a copper plate (Figure 6, left) and a shell cup (Figure 6, right). The noses in these examples have a number of bends in them. The latter is of a Braden A style head wearing an ear maskette with four or five folds in the nose?depending on the drawing.1 The neck of the figure on the right is en graved as a crenellated line probably indicating that it has been severed (Brown and Kelly 1996:26). There is a likely connection being made here between the zigzag bending of the nose (as seen in the Meppen maskette) and the depictions on the shell cup and copper plate. Oral Tradition of "The Children of the Sun" We believe that the broad distribution of the long-nosed god maskettes through out the Midwest and Southeast mirrors the widespread distribution of oral tradi tions with a common theme. Hall states that no one is sure what the long-nosed god maskettes represent (1997:147). We propose that they represent specific characters, subjects of a widespread and frequently collected oral tradition. Within this widespread oral tradition, there are twins (brothers, twin boys). In most sto ries, their mother is killed and one boy is found and raised in his mother's lodge,</page><page sequence="7">Of Masks and Myths 7 Figure 5. Close-up showing how the maskettes were constructed. The nose is riveted to a raised center section. while his brother is "thrown away"?here alluding to "afterbirth" and duality (Swanton 1995:4). One boy is civilized and brought up in a conventional house hold. The other is "wild" or "unknown." In some versions, the wild boy is brought up by a "little stump" on the edge of a lake (Radin 1948:138). In another version (Lowie 1993:75), the wild boy is brought up by an underwater spirit who lives in a spring. It is this oral tradition, in its most basic aspect, that plays upon the concept of duality. In most of the oral traditions, the wild boy takes the opposite of every command given to him by his father. He becomes a "contrary" figure, an oppos ing force. The two brothers, the sacred twins, exemplify a duality of opposites?</page><page sequence="8">8 James R. Duncan and Carol Diaz-Granados Figure 6. "Bent nose" figures: left, detail of repouss? copper plate, redrawn from photo in Hamilton et al. 1974:88, Figure 51; right, detail of cup, UAM 37-1-4, re drawn from Phillips and Brown 1978:Plate 17. a representation of the forces that must be balanced and maintained to stay in harmony with the universe. Lankford states that "The number of texts of the Twins tales which have been collected in North and South America is truly stag gering" (1987:170). L?vi-Strauss finds world-wide correlations between twin tales and weather disturbances (L?vi-Strauss 1979:25). There are a number of stories about the two boys getting together for play and mischief. The stories work their way to an adult's discovery of the presence of the wild boy and his ultimate incorporation back into the family. In one story, the father of the boys hangs fat deer tails on a string for the civilized boy to play with while the father is out hunting. The wild boy arrives and the two boys shoot arrows at the deer tails. Occasionally they bite the tails. The wild boy's teeth marks are quite large (Radin 1948:139) because he has the fangs of a water spirit, a great serpent or being that lives in a spring or river (Bowers 1965:359). The size of these teeth marks reveals to the father that there is another boy nearby beside his civilized son. In the Creek version, the little boy living in the house asks for arrows and two bows, thus inadvertently revealing that there is a second boy (Swanton 1995:4). Further along in the sequence, another story is told. The wild boy comes al most daily to play with his brother, but he never stays long, especially when an adult is about to arrive on the scene. In Dorsey's Caddo version, the wild boy "had a rather long nose" (Lankford 1987:165). After a long period of time, the "wild boy" is finally caught and persuaded to stay with his civilized brother. In the majority of versions, he is adopted or "civilized." His brother boils water to clean him up, and "medicine man" cuts his nose short so that "he will look hu man." He is thus brought into his family?and "civilized" by being cleaned and having his nose shortened. The Adoption Ritual and Its Related Iconography Among the sedentary American Indian groups under discussion, adoptions were</page><page sequence="9">Of Masks and Myths 9 a common mechanism used to promote kindred relations and foster trade. People from one group would adopt members of an alien group who they believed could offer them some benefits. Because adoption created kinship and established fa milial ties, conflicts were often avoided. Hall (1997:48-58) and Brown (1989:311 331) have described the historic practice of the singing of the calumet as a wide spread and much recognized adoption rite. It is entirely possible that there were a number of different mechanisms by which one could adopt an individual from another group; the scenario described by Ronda (1984:89) is another one of them. One of the most impressive adoption ceremonies was that of the Osage adop tion of war captives. The ritual involved the captive being placed at the rear of the host's lodge at "the seat [place] of the stranger" (Fletcher and LaFlesche 1992:61). The ritual of initiation and naming of a child was performed; the new "child" was then given the accounts of the creation and history of the group, and the captive was taken around the tribal circle. The leader of the war clans then took a sharp flint knife and gave a quick stroke to the end of the captive's nose "causing the blood to flow." The Tzi-sho leader then wiped away the blood. The Tzi-sho or Tsi-zhu leader represented the elder sky people whose symbol is the sun (LaFlesche 1995:38). The captive was given food and water, and the single pipe, presented on fronds of cedar, was smoked (Fletcher and La Flesche 1992:61 62). The Nu'xe or "ice" leader anointed the captive's body with buffalo fat and the O'pxon or elk leader painted two black stripes diagonally on the face, in recognition of "Thunder," the god of war. This done, the Tzi-sho leader announced the captive as "Ni'wathe"?"made to live." It is revealing, we believe, that the Osage singled out the war captive's nose. Why not the chin, forehead, or even a finger? Recently, the authors asked an Osage, a descendent of a member of the Gthon' I-ni-ka-sh-ga clan (Bailey 1995:40; La Flesche 1939), about the rites and obliga tions of this high-status clan. This was the reply: "Men of this clan were not supposed to start fires or push a stick or post into the ground; to do so would cause big storms and lots of lightning." In this remark, we hear a surviving frag ment of this very "thunder power," handed down from an Osage ancestor. This comment demonstrates that knowledge of Osage elders who possessed the power of controlling weather (Thunder people) can still be recovered from the memory of a living Osage. Power, or perceived power, to control the elements of nature was a highly regarded skill. The oral traditions of the Sioux, Hidatsa, Caddo, and Winnebago described the twins as having great power as well. The civilized boy can transform himself into thunder or a gentle rain with no thunder (Bowers 1965:361-62). He can even bring his wild brother back to life. In Lankford's Caddo version, either boy can bring the other back to life. This scenario is important when one recalls that the adoption candidate is symbolically resurrected by his "civilized brother" with the "arrow" of the adoption pipe stem (Monka) (Hall 1997:151). He is usually resurrected as the young speckled or spotted hawk or eagle (La Flesche 1939:206 211). The arrows in the civilized boy's sacred bundle possess great power and are used to open wounds, remove arrows (or bullets), and aid in the healing of</page><page sequence="10">10 James R. Duncan and Carol Diaz-Granados these wounds (Bowers 1965:360), and to resurrect the dead (black arrows) (Lankford 1987:167-169). In a Caddo story of the twins, the wild or "Unknown" boy climbs a pecan tree he has just planted. He tells his little brother that after all his bones have fallen, he must cover them with a buffalo calf's hide, take a black arrow and shoot it into the air, and when it comes down tell him (the pile of bones) "to get out of the way" (Lankford 1987:168). The scenario takes place, and the resurrected wild boy says, "My father gave me very dangerous power, and so brother, you must climb up the tree and he will give you power, too" (Lankford 1987:168). So the younger brother does the same and gains great power. The boy then tells his little brother "to show him what kind of power he had," and "the little boy begins making a loud noise that sounds like thunder when it rains, and then the wild boy sticks his tongue out and it appears as a flash of lightening" (Lankford 1987:169). The boys are later referred to as "Lightening boy" and "Thunder boy." The Winnebago refer to the brothers as "children of the sun" (Radin 1950:404); more commonly the two brothers are referred to as the "Thunderers" (e.g., Bow ers 1965[(Hidatsa]; Dorsey 1906 [Pawnee]; Dorsey, in Lankford 1987 [Caddo]; Lowie 1993 [Crow]; Radin 1948 [Winnebago]; S wanton 1995 [Creek]; Walker 1983 [Lakota]). We believe that the "Thunderers" oral tradition is reflected in prehistoric eastern North America in the distinctive long-nosed god ear orna ments. L?vi-Strauss, in his analysis of four Winnebago myths, perceives a process in which the heroes make contributions to their society by giving up their full lives in order to increase the life spans for members of their group, thereby earning the right to be reincarnated (1996:327-329). The adoption ceremonies of the Osage, Hidatsa, and other sedentary groups seem to evoke this part of the Thunderers legend. Walker (1983:58-89) also relates this oral tradition, this time for the Lakota. The "Heyoka," or "contraries," remained a powerful sociomilitary soci ety into the nineteenth century (Hall 1997:132-134). In Radin's "The Twin Cycle" (1948), the wild boy states that he is "crazy" but that his powers are so great that he can accomplish feats considered impossible. One of the most stunning or "crazy" feats is the killing and eating of the powerful "thunderbirds." The act of killing and eating beings as commanding as "thunderbirds" is startling and full of imagery; hence, the "Heyoka" or "crazy" state of a contrary one, one who does a forbidden thing (Radin 1948:140-144). In another reference to "eating," the civilized boy eats conventional food, but the wild boy eats the food of his earliest ancestors (Meyer 1977:11). In the Winnebago version, the civilized boy is called "flesh," and the wild boy is called "stump" or "ghost" (Radin 1948:138; 1954:67). In one of the wild boy's many adventures, he is decapitated and replaces his own lost head with a rattle. He thus becomes a "rattle" head (Lowie 1993:83). One of the W?lfing plates found in Dunklin County, Missouri, shows a human avian "transformation" with an agnathous wooden "human head" rattle on a band on the side of the forehead (Figure 7). This agnathous form of rattle has been recovered from a few archaeological sites: Etowah (Brain and Phillips 1996:159),</page><page sequence="11">Of Masks and Myths 11 Figure 7. Details from a W?lfing Plate found in Dunklin County, Missouri: left, headdress; right, detail of agnathous head rattle pictured on headdress. Spiro (Brown 1996:528), and the Emmons Cemetery (Kelly 1991:73). The forms are surprisingly similar. In reviewing Lewis Larson's discussion of the wooden human head rattle found at the Etowah site, Mound C, we agree with his suppo sition that the rattle is connected to the long-nosed god maskettes. It would ap pear that this important object could be symbolic of the wild boy's decapitated head (Larson 1957:6-11). The "head rattle" survives as an important part of the Osage clan bundles. The Osage refer to this rattle as the p?-xe, a term for "head," and it was the only musical instrument used in the recitation of the clan origin songs (Bailey 1995:80). These songs were an important part of the war captive adoption ceremony (Fletcher and LaFlesche 1992:61-62). Plate 17 in Phillips and Brown (1978; Cup UAM 37-1-4) shows eight human heads with ornaments rendered in Braden A style. One head is wearing the "ag nathous" head effigy or rattle, similar to one seen on the W?lfing plate; another is wearing a "bent" nose, long-nosed god maskette. Once again, both allude to symbols of the "Thunderers." Another bent nose maskette is seen on the copper plate from Spiro burial #122 (Hamilton 1974:88), mentioned previously. We believe that the variations of the noses on these ear ornaments could indicate degrees of adoption, general social status, or a state of being such as death. Fur thermore, this modification process was most likely performed in a ritual man ner. Perhaps the individual first received his long-nosed god maskettes, indicat ing initiation of the adoption process. Later, a portion of the nose was cut or bent, probably in ritual, as one became more "civilized." And finally, as in the Thunderer traditions, the nose was cut short, probably symbolizing the individual's com plete acceptance into the adoptive group. To take this scenario even further, when the maskette nose was bent or cut, perhaps the owner was resurrected or "awak ened" as in the stories where the brothers bring one another back to life (Lankford 1987:168; Radin 1948:140-144). It should be kept in mind that the faces of these long-nosed god maskettes are strikingly similar, the only variation being in the nose length or treatment: long, bent/broken, short.</page><page sequence="12">12 James R. Duncan and Carol Diaz-Granados The ritual death and reviving of the brothers is a meaningful theme throughout these related oral traditions. This theme is no doubt connected to the "healing" powers of the thunder bundle owners and their ability to heal specific injuries. There is also a probable connection between clan bundle rituals and the treat ment of the dead, because there is a strong indication that reincarnation of spe cific persons was expected?particularly respected, notable individuals, as well as powerful mythical characters. This desired reincarnation is the central theme of the calumet adoption ceremony (Hall 1997:57). Because these are oral tradi tions, it is rare to find anything but fragmentary and isolated symbols of such stories or the characters in them. This is why the discoveries of the Gottschall Shelter pictographs (Salzer 1987) and the Picture Cave pictographs (Diaz Granados 1993; Diaz-Granados and Duncan 2000) are so significant. The Pictograph On the wall of Picture Cave in Missouri are pictographs that we believe relate to the two Thunderers or Children of the Sun oral traditions.2 One of the most strik ing, albeit small, pictographs is that of a figure wearing a long-nosed god maskette (Figure 8). The figure measures 30.6 cm in height and 30.6 cm in width. The size of the white maskette from cheek to tip of nose is about 6 cm. (This is the only known pictograph in Missouri that uses white pigment; Diaz-Granados 1993:160.) The attributes of the figure suggest that he is the son of He-who-wears-human heads-as-earrings, or as the Winnebago call him, "Red Horn," who bore the same traits as his father (Radin 1948:129). The figure's attributes include the forehead Figure 8. Missouri pictograph showing long-nosed god maskette in place on side of figure's head.</page><page sequence="13">Of Masks and Myths 13 plaque with arrows positioned in it,3 a hair knot at the back of his head, the vertically striped body paint (which indicates a sun or morning star figure), and an eye painted on the torso. This figure, wearing the white (shell or bone) long nosed god maskette, carries a severed human head (and partial torso) also with vertical stripes, in the right hand and a bow and arrows in the left. The head is feasibly that of a Red Horn personality (the father) being taken by his son to be reincarnated. A warrior symbol, the white plume hanging from the head is also considered an icon of the morning star figure (Gill and Sullivan 1992:196). A wapiti (elk) lies upside down (dead) to the lower right. In at least one oral tradi tion, Red Horn's son kills an elk (Radin 1948:133). Red Horn is a colorful character who can change his appearance at will. He has at least two aliases, best described by a passage given to Radin by his Winnebago informant, Sam Blowsnake, who quoted the oral tradition as spoken from Red Horn (the little brother) himself. Blowsnake said Now the little brother stood up and said, "Those in the heavens who created me did not call me by this name, He-who-is-hit-with-deer-lungs. They called me He-who-wears-human-heads-as-earrings." With that he spat upon his hands and began fingering his ears. And as he did this, little faces suddenly ap peared on his ears, laughing, winking and sticking out their tongues. Then he spoke again, "Those on earth, when they speak of me, call me Red Horn." With this he spat upon his hands, and drew them over his hair which then became very long and red. [Radin 1948:117] The Osage adoption ceremonies traditionally use one or two calumet pipes, some with bells, said to represent the sound of thunder, and two tufts of owl feathers, said to represent deer lungs. This is where a spatial connection can be made between the Red Horn personality and the Red Horn epic myth cycle or oral tradition. Along with "He-who-wears-human-heads-as-earrings," Red Horn is also known by the alias, "He-who-is-hit-with-deer-lungs" (Radin 1948:117; Hall 1997:149), in other words, "He who is adopted into another clan." It is during the ceremony in which one is "struck" with deer lungs (a pipe with owl feathers) that symbolic entrance into one's adoptive clan takes place. The Osage refer to the stem of an adoption pipe as Monka, which also means arrow, and Monkon translates as "pipe" in Omaha (Fletcher and La Flesche 1992:48). So, after Red Horn identifies himself, he changes his appearance: "He spat upon his hands. And as he did this, little faces suddenly appeared on his ears, laughing, winking, and sticking out their tongues." This phrase alludes to Red Horn's possession of the god maskette ear ornaments. Then Red Horn speaks again: "Those on earth, when they speak of me, call me Red Horn. With this he spat upon his hands, and drew them over his hair which then became very long and red." (Radin 1948:117-118). Radin acknowledges that Red Horn represents a probable fusion of two distinct characters: the more recent Red Horn and the ancient "He-who-wears-human-heads-as-earrings." It is most likely the latter version or incarnation that we see depicted at Picture Cave (Radin 1948:41). This pictograph image is unique both in style and in the technique used to</page><page sequence="14">14 James R. Duncan and Carol Diaz-Granados execute it. The figure is rendered in white with a black outline and delicate ver tical striping. The white plume on the decapitated head and the long-nosed ear ornament were first incised into the cave wall. In the case of the plume, the lines are filled with white pigment. The ear ornament has the outline incised and the enclosed area was then filled in with white pigment, and the details such as the eye and mouth are delicately outlined with a black pigment. The torso of the figure wearing the ear ornament has an "eye" motif in the upper chest area, a motif also appearing on the severed head. This eye is very similar in form to the eye on the chin of the sandstone head from the Gottschall site in Wisconsin (Salzer 1997:55). The pottery fragments found in the cave have been identified as Early Missis sippian/Mississippian. A local collector reports that some of the points collected in years past, before the cave was gated, were identical to Cahokia points. The four AMS dates for the cave pictographs range from 940?80 years .P. to 1090190 years .P. (TAMU 41464,41465,38458,41466). This places the associated pic tographs and site into a time span that begins with the Late Emergent (Develop mental) Mississippian phase and ending in the late Lohmann or early Stirling phase. We suggest the reader refer to chronologies in Hall (1991:10) and Pauketat and Emerson (1997:7) for the Cahokia area. The figure of "He-who-wears-hu man-heads-as-earrings" differs stylistically enough from the dated pictographs to be judged as either earlier or later. The fact that it is coated with a thick silica skin (Si02) points to the possibility of it being earlier. It is conceivable that the placement of this figure became an impetus to the involved individuals to return to this sacred site to create additional images, several which appear to relate to these continuing oral traditions. To the right of the striped figure, on an adjacent wall, is a pictograph of a large serpentine underwater spirit (piasa, uktena, etc.). Often, the underwater spirit is depicted in profile to allow the full appearance of the body. However, its head is most often shown frontally, maybe to offer a more frightening, awesome image. The head and face of this underwater spirit, drawn in frontal view, clearly show the defining attributes: antlers, dark mask, ear spools, fangs, and round eyes (Diaz-Granados 1993:564, Illus. 27.1c). The head alone is shown frontally in a cave in Tennessee (Faulkner 1988:239, Figure 8E). The underwater spirit lo cated on the opposing wall in the Missouri cave has round eyes rendered with a prominent central dot for the pupil, the same kind of eye (dot-in-circle) as seen on the long-nosed maskette ear ornaments. The similarity may originate from the version of the oral tradition in which one of the twins is raised by the water spirit. In the panel to the left of the figure wearing the long-nosed maskette are two figures in black, each about 25 cm in height, carrying bows and arrows and wearing tailed belts and unusually large balloon-like headdresses (Figure 9). According to Winnebago tradition, the "Children of the Sun" wore inflated tur key bladders as headdresses (Radin 1948:140). These pictographs may depict the Thunderers with their "turkey bladder" headdresses. Male turkeys inflate these bladders during the spring mating season to make a low hum or rattling</page><page sequence="15">Of Masks and Myths 15 Figure 9. "Children of the Sun" or "Thunderers" alongside character with pat terned wrap (from Picture Cave). sound, much like "soft thunder," drawing another parallel to the "Thunderers." In the Thunderer Twins legend, these inflated turkey bladders were attached to the boys to keep the boys from going back into the lake and drowning (Radin 1948:140). In Bodmer's painting (Thomas and Ronnefeldt 1976:223), Pehriska Ruhpa, an eminent Hidatsa, is shown wearing a large headdress with a medial fan of turkey tail feathers (a probable war symbol) and an upright red plume. Turkey beards (likened to human scalps) were used for some of the vertical elements of traditional Osage hair roaches. Other turkey motifs are present in the cave. To the right and above the pictograph of the two figures is another large water spirit, this time in profile, with antlers and a beaver tail. Its body is pierced by arrows. The Winnebago narrative relates that the twins killed a bea ver-tailed water spirit, one of the four foundation posts of the cosmos?four great water spirits (Radin 1948:151; 1954:48). It seems appropriate at this time to connect the "Children of the Sun/ Thunderers" with "He-who-wears-human-heads-as-earrings." As the most an cient form, "He-who-wears-human-heads-as-earrings" is one of the four princi pal deities of the Winnebago. Radin also identifies He-who-wears-human-heads as-earrings as the morning star (Radin 1948:41). In Sam Blowsnake's telling of the Red Horn story, "He-who-wears-human-heads-as-earrings" demonstrates his thunder power in a very casual and offhand manner. While his friend, the giant thunderbird "Storms-as-he-walks," a congenial figure who likes human com</page><page sequence="16">16 James R. Duncan and Carol Diaz-Granados pany, is preparing to scout an enemy town by flying around it, Red Horn joins him by simply walking up into the clouds (Radin 1948:121). This thunder power possessed by "He-who-wears-human-heads-as-eairings" and the "Children of the Sun" has connections to bundles. These bundles are viewed as powerful spiri tual helpers, particularly by the bundle owners. Thunder Power Bundles The Children of the Sun, or Thunderers, are associated with collections of sacred or holy objects called "bundles" (Bowers 1965:359). The bundles are passed usually from father to son, with a reciprocal exchange of goods, and are power ful aids in warfare and healing. While there is a definite opposition between warfare, which inflicts injuries, and healing, which alleviates or cures, both re sult in rewards: captives, captured goods, and trophies in war and compensation to the healer by the person who is "cured." In sedentary Plains societies, one strengthens the other. Warfare was one of the most important activities and key to social and political advancement (Meyer 1977:70). Having a powerful sacred bundle, particularly of the Thunder being type, was a great enhancement to one's social standing. Among the Hidatsa, the Thunder Bundle owner was one of "the four protectors of the people," the protector of the west direction (Bowers 1965:38). Vision questers who dreamed of these thunder beings and who desired to ac quire thunder power often made and used thunder bundles and thunder symbol ism. Thunder bundles display a measure of uniformity (Bailey 1995:80; Bowers 1965:358-373). They contain all or some of the following (Bailey 1995:54-55): 1. beaver fur and claws 2. otter skin 3. deer skin for a tobacco pouch 4. black medicine root (wild boy or spring boy bundle) 5. sweet grass 6. cedar 7. holy arrows 8. paints 9. song counting sticks 10. scalp and "head" rattle 11. one or two pipes with bells to imitate thunder (Calumets) 12. war club 13. a tattooing kit Iconography The dominant feature of the maskettes, over and above the cleft headdress and round eyes, is the long nose. The Caddo attached great weight to the long nose of the wild boy, which was trimmed to human length after six days of cleansing,</page><page sequence="17">Of Masks and Myths 17 dressing, and washing (Lankford 1987:167). The long-nosed iconography is evi dent in another item of material culture, the Douglass Gorget from New Madrid County, Missouri (Brain and Phillips 1996:53; Phillips and Brown 1978:177) (Figure 10). The figure displays an impressively long nose, bi-lobed arrow hair ornaments, bellows-shaped apron, forehead plaque, chunkey hat, and war club. If we had to draw a picture of the wild boy, we could not have done a better job! The border of this gorget has six concentric circles engraved on it. These might refer to the six-day ceremony to which the wild boy was subjected. In regard to the mace form of war club in the belt, pictured on the gorget, the Hidatsa told Bowers that the Thunderer Twins were star people and carried war clubs, painted red, in their belts (Bowers 1965:465). The hafted bell-shaped spatulate celt form associated with the Cahokia region and areas south along the Mississippi River might also be related (Brown 1996:479; Chapman 1980:Figs. 5-30). Apetroglyph showing a figure brandishing such a weapon (Figure 11) can be seen at the Maddin Creek site in northern Washington County, Missouri. This figure faces another of equal size, suggesting that they could be portraying one of the "Twin" stories. Between them is a much larger, upended anthropomorph, perhaps the portrayal of a giant in the process of being overpowered. The anthropomorph to the right exhibits a "ponytail," which originally may have been painted red. Because sev Figure 10. Douglass Gorget (redrawn from Phillips and Brown 1978:177, Figure 230).</page><page sequence="18">18 James R. Duncan and Carol Diaz-Granados Figure 11. Petroglyph on boulder at Madden Creek site, Missouri. Note figure to right with raised war club and extended hair lock. eral of Missouri's petroglyphs have retained faint traces of pigments, we know that some of the carved areas were filled with red or black paint, each color carrying its own symbolism (Diaz-Granados 1993:158-163). Another probable portrayal of the Children of the Sun or Thunder Twins is found in the Rogan Plate from Mound C at Etowah (Waring 1977:43). This cop per plate (Figure 12) depicts a long-nosed or beaked being with many features common to the figure on the Douglass Gorget: forehead plaque, bi-lobed arrow, long hair braid, ear spools, bellows-shaped apron, beaded belt, calf and wrist bands, and quartered mace, or war club, along with a human head in the left hand. A woven, rush mat forehead plaque could allude to the "rush mat degree," an essential part of the Osage war rite (La Flesche 1939:59). Under the forehead plaque of the Douglass Gorget figure is the chunkey hat, similar to the one por trayed on the St. Mary Gorget (Phillips and Brown 1978:178). The prominent sash tassel on the Douglass Gorget is almost identical to the one portrayed on the Rogan plate (Phillips and Brown 1978:188). Economics Along with the adoption theme and thunder power associations with the long nosed ear ornaments comes another important correlation that can be further integrated at this point?that of economics. While reviewing oral traditions and examining associated symbolism in the material culture, we have taken a de tailed look at the long-nosed god maskettes and their variations, particularly in the case of the copper maskettes found by Fecht. As previously mentioned, one was bent in accordion fashion?a possible method of shortening the nose alter natively to actually cutting it off. The ear ornament found in the "Big Mound," however, seems to have had its nose cut off, and such cutting is a feature of the Caddo story as previously mentioned. Cutting of his nose to "civilize" the wild</page><page sequence="19">Of Masks and Myths 19 Figure 12. Rogan Plate from Etowah, Georgia, drawn from a photograph. boy seems to be an important part of a dramatic portrayal relating to degrees of civility or plausibly to levels of adoption into another clan, usually an economic maneuver?wealth being gained through the exchange of goods as gifts and trade. As mentioned earlier, an adoptee may have been presented with the long-nosed maskettes, then later, after acceptance and sufficient economic and social ex change, the nose of the ear ornament was symbolically and ritually trimmed as a symbol of the process of becoming more civilized, that is, more thoroughly inte grated into the person's adoptive clan. The ritual of becoming more civilized (and more accepted) was ritually and visually recreated with an elaborate ex change of material offerings by the adoptee to his new family or by the family to their new member, or both. Wealth has a meaningful place in the thunderer 's story. Shell beads were a prestigious commodity among the western Mississippians, and the importance of shells as a source of wealth among the Eastern Woodland populations is well</page><page sequence="20">20 James R. Duncan and Carol DIaz-Granados documented (DeVries 1857; Muller 1987; Prentice 1987; Trubitt 1996). The value of shell beads?"the great fancy they have for them"?was observed by DeVries in 1638 (DeVries 1857:95). Brown and his colleagues (1990:264, 270) refer to marine-shell prestige goods as "emblems of the rank derived from personal ex ploits and inherited honor." One of the wild boy's many attributes is that he might be a "bead spitter" (Bowers 1965:305,488). We believe that the shells he vomits are the shells from which the coveted beads are made. The Creek version of the story names the father of the two boys as "Bead Spitter" (Hall 1997:162-163; Swanton 1995:2). In both cases, there is an apparent association with shell beads. The esteem given to shell beads in eastern North America is an old tradition and played an important part in intergroup trade and economics prior to the con tact period. There was undoubtedly a symbolic reference regarding the material from which the ear ornaments were made?shell, copper, or bone?each me dium carrying its own prestige or encoded iconography according to its color and other factors. In particular, the color "white" is of note. It is the color of shells and was considered a color of "power" among early societies (Hamell 1992). The use of white pigment, for the ear ornament in the pictograph as well as for the feather and body, occurs only in this one rock graphic in Missouri and was surely meant to convey an expression of elevated status for the character represented. Summary and Conclusion In a complex oral tradition, the Children of the Sun/Thunderers (twin brothers) are attributed miraculous powers and are linked to the character "He-who-wears human-heads-as-earrings." It appears that this tradition includes rituals and sym bolism involving the adoption of war captives. This, in turn, is a small part of a larger socio-religious-economic pattern involving exchange through the ritualis tic establishment of adoptive kinship (adoptive war captives were allowed to visit their blood relatives). We see the adoption of war captives as being an eco nomically beneficial and, in some instances, probably pivotal activity within western Mississippian societies. The term "children" was often used to refer to adopted war captives. In Hidatsa households, men with many "children" were materially better off than those with few or no "children," and assimilation of war captives into various clans was rapid (Bowers 1963:260). Among the Osage, the clan member who took the captive usually kept the captive in his clan as a "sho-ka" or clan messenger and helper. The captive or "da-gthe" was a welcome addition to the clan and some times assisted as a "crier" or announcer and also as a helper at feasts (La Flesche 1939:83-84). We believe that the adoption of war prisoners was of great importance in the ascendancy of households and clans in western Mississippian society. This may in turn have resulted in the creation, exchange, and movement of objects depict ing the "Children of the Sun" and, more rarely, "He-who-wears-human-heads</page><page sequence="21">Of Masks and Myths 21 as-earrings." Adoptive war captives bolstered the population and added produc tive hands to the production of material goods and the procurement of food stuffs. These ceremonies and their accompanying iconography and symbolic paraphernalia attest to the importance of this adoption mechanism in western Mississippian societies. Although 37 (maskettes) is a respectable number for any artifact type, it would not account for all the adoptees over an extended period of time. Many maskettes probably were made of perishable materials, and although shell itself is a perish able material, others have surely disintegrated. In describing 26 small, copper covered, cedar-wood ear ornaments with shell inlays, Brown (1996:529) expands the data and raises the possibility that other materials as well as other styles of human head maskettes were being used. We have attempted to briefly interpret the function of a group of artifacts and their associated iconography which manifest a strong connection to a widespread and complex oral tradition. We believe that these long-nosed ear ornaments rep resent the Children of the Sun or Thunderers, twin brothers, one civilized and one wild. These ear ornaments likely were used in the recreation of stories and reenactments of traditional rituals of adoption, mimicking the adoption of the wild boy by the civilized boy and his family, hence, the adoption of outsiders into western Mississippian social groups. The stories of the two brothers are widespread and complex. These narratives share many commonalities, of which we have only described a few. In fact, several different versions have been col lected from the same group. This widely repeated scenario, as evidenced in the ethnographic data, offers a glimpse into a plausible form of social mobility. Moreover, such a system would have allowed groups using this ritual access to trade and enabled the adoptees to enjoy a privileged status for the manufacture and exchange of goods and for other economic activities not possible through consanguineal hereditary mechanisms alone. In other words, it was the adoption or civilization process?by degrees?that advanced the adoptees to their elevated social ranks. Their position, the first possibly marked by the awarding and reception of the maskettes, was not the culminating act, but a beginning. Artifacts and imagery indicate that other modi fications to the maskette noses followed, including the ritual bending, cutting, or replacement of the long-nosed maskette, with the short-nosed maskette complet ing the cycle. When the Craig Mound mortuary at Spiro was discovered, a large stone pipe was found among the enormous deposits of shell beads and ornaments. This Big Boy (or Resting Warrior) pipe is an excellent portrayal of the suggested ritual (Brown 1996:522; Hamilton 1952:134). The short or clipped nose maskettes he is wearing, similar to those found archaeologically in a number of locations, could signify that he is a high-status figure, fully civilized and, hence, fully adopted into a particular, possibly elite, group. Ethnographic accounts discuss early-nineteenth-century agriculturists on the upper Missouri River who staged elaborate ceremonies and feasts where the Thunderers were impersonated (Bowers 1965:350). These characters from the</page><page sequence="22">22 James R. Duncan and Carol Dlaz-Granados oral traditions were remembered and revered. We are aware that changes in the ritual and its associated material culture may have occurred both over time and from region to region. Yet this important oral tradition obviously endured over many centuries and produced considerably more material culture than has been recognized or retrieved archaeologically to date.
