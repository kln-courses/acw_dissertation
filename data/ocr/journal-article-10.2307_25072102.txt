<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Michael Keeley, A Social-Contract Theory of Organiza tions. Notre Dame, In: University of Notre Dame Press, 1988,277 pp. Michael Keeley has written A Social-Contract Theory of Organizations with the expressed aim of building a better version of organization science.1 In particular, he is intent upon extending the empirical sweep ? or domain, if you prefer the rhetoric of organization science ? of his field. Keeley ventures far afield from routine theory building in organization science, venturing thoughtfully into the forest of moral philosophy. He returns from that trek with the concepts of voluntarism, contract, and right, which he uses to structure a story about organizations as social contracts; i.e.: . . . series of working agreements between natural persons specifying mutual (not necessarily equal or voluntary) rights and obligations, (p. 226) In all, the undertaking is impressively ambitious. Keeley is not content with merely offering what reviewer Marc Mentzer proposes is a "long over due" critique of organization science.2 Nor is he enamored, in the praise of pluralism, with simply adding to the cacophony of metaphors for 'organ ization'.3 Rather, he enriches his critique by sketching a reconstructed organization science, expends considerable effort in defending his reconstruction, and informs both efforts with a faithful rendition of the contractarian tradition. At a time when the winds of theory-building about organizations blow management studies further and further away from anything resembl ing a humanist account, Keeley's book is a pre ferable gale of fresh air.4 At the same time, Keeley provides a confusing argument in support of a social-contract inter pretation of organized business activity. As much as anything else, he tries to do too much. Arguing first toward a postmodern ethical defense and then toward a foundationalist justification, Keeley tends to sap the strength of the former, "lead" argument with his preference for the latter. I will argue here that this confusion is unnecessary on two counts. First, Keeley can make a compelling case for a social-contract interpretation of organ izations by means of his ethical argument alone; in fact, he is well on his way to doing so until he abruptly changes directions in Chapter 5. Second, Keeley's reluctance to part company with certain assumptions from the canon of organization science prevents him from arriving at the ironic conclusion to which he unwittingly guides his readers: rather than needing enhancement, organ ization science can be clearly understood as an increasingly redundant account of social interac tion. In the end, the problem rests less with Keeley's skills at argumentation and more with organization science per se. We can understand Keeley's critique in six parts: 1. Organization science concepts can be understood as preferences of the researchers who perpetrate them. Keeley makes this postmodern point at the very outset It is not widely recognized that these [received orientations] are preferences, that there are alterna tives deserving careful consideration. At least this is the thesis of the book. (p. ix) After labelling "value-free" social science as a "misguided" effort (p. 1), he moves the discussion about research into the territory of ethical inquiry when he proposes that: A choice must be made regarding which facts are interesting and which are not; and values affect the choice, (p. 5) Generally speaking here, the facts that interest Keeley are those that deal with persons and how well they fare from interacting with one another at an organization. 2. The preferred canon of organization science (a) generally ignores complex, everyday interaction among persons at the organization and (b) relies on Journal of Business Ethics 9: 813-817, 1990.</page><page sequence="2">814 Book Reviews a presumption that persons passively accept what organization managers want them to accept about the ends of organizational activity. The most visible manifestation of this pair of preferences, Keeley claims, is the bellwether anthropomorphic premiss in organization science which holds that organizations have and seek goals. He makes clear his objection to this assumption before the reader has finished the first page of the Preface. 3. All persons, upon their considered judgments, would prefer generally to act voluntarily in their interactions with one another, as opposed to being coerced into doing so. Keeley narrows this preference to the context of organizations, primarily with regard to employ ment relationships. At the confluence of these three assumptions, Keeley concludes first that: 4. The preferred canon of organization science subordinates voluntary action to organizational goal-seeking and thereby is open to question as a preferred account about organized activity. In search of an improvement on this state of affairs, Keeley again turns to ethical inquiry. 5. Some moral philosophers have crafted an inter pretation of social interaction that is congenial to voluntary action, whereby persons generally engage in contractual relations, protected by rights, towards ends that they value as their own. Hence, a second conclusion follows: 6. Organization science researchers can ask questions of "wider relevance" (p. ix) about human interac tion at the organization by substituting a right based, contractual interpretation of organization for the narrower goal-based interpretation. By bringing organization science into an ethical sphere of analysis, Keeley has, to this point, accomplished two ends that are rarely found in the discourse of organization science. First, he provides a rudimentary postmodern argument about theory assessment, in terms of enabling researchers to ask new questions hereto fore unintelligible under the popular canon of organization science. The very canon is open to question, in other words, at the level of concepts and propositions and the like. Second, he offers a rudimentary postmodern, ethical claim for the advantages of a social-contract view, to the extent that he relocates the level of meaningful moral action from the collective to the person. So far, so good. Keeley begins to extend his defense by com paring critically how the rival views about organ izations fare on some common testing ground. For this test, he chooses a norm of social harmony. He argues, again as a consistent postmodern, for the social-contract view as a more explicit guar antor that the participation rights of persons interacting at the organization will remain in the limelight. ... the welfare of all participants is likely to get more consideration in a right-based system than in a goal based one, wherein the fate of specific individuals is not of prime importance, (p. 101) This generality of coverage, he argues, is likely more conducive to social harmony at the organi zation than the goal-based model which vests power and privilege in members of the dominant managerial elite who dictate, and compel others' attention toward, goals for an organization: Imbalances of power and privilege are readily exposed by a right-based theory, (p. 105) Not only is there "nothing inevitable about a pro managerial line of inquiry" (p. 104), but such a conception of human interaction, he suggests, is less stable ? hence, less preferable ? than a political one open to a host of self-interested organization participants. This, again, is an argu ment rarely heard in the discourse about organi zations. Keeley then takes his social-contract inter pretation "on the road" to demonstrate the durability of this account across a diverse range of human interaction. He devotes Chapter 4 ("Appli cations") to this replication task in an organiza tional context.5 Prior to this, in Chapter 3, he adds an historical defense. Focusing on the generaliza bility of the concepts of right and contract, he draws a link between medieval and feudal prac tices, on one hand, and modern Western political</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 815 philosophy, on the other. In Chapter 5, he defends the usefulness of human rights as a conceptual window on the concept of freedom. If the line of argument were to conclude here, I would recom mend the book unconditionally as a cogent application of contractarian and postmodern thinking to modern organizations. But, Keeley does not leave well enough alone. Parallel to the line of ethical argument, and often intertwined with it, Keeley remains dedi cated to organization science. Unfortunately for the book's persuasive appeal, this dedication begins to undo the ethical argument. The prob lem is evident in two principal respects. First, it becomes more and more apparent as the book unfolds that Keeley prefers a right-based model for its "empirical reality", a well-known part of the organization science canon, and only in passing for its moral appeal. Early on, the language gives away Keeley's preference for ethi cal inquiry as merely a warm-up act to the search for a "more realistic picture of organizational life" (p. ix): Whether organizations are voluntary or not, we can draw an empirically valid picture of their operation from a contractual perspective, (p. 16) By the midpoint of Chapter 3, it is clear where the defense is headed: For the conduct of social inquiry, the rationale for individual rights is that these beliefs have factual, behavioral implications, (p. 77) Lest there be any lingering doubt, Keeley assures his colleagues: Nothing here implies abandonment of the no-non sense empirical work that organizational researchers prize, (p. 154) This tack is, of course, Keeley's to choose. Yet, when taken in the context of his ethical argu ment, these foundationalist premisses augur seri ous erosion of his case for a social-contract account. We can understand this threat in two regards. 1. The argument that the social-contract account is better because it is "more real" is circular and thus unpersuasive. Keeley attempts to call upon "hard facts" as a defense for the right-based perspective that he prefers. Yet, the case is contrived inasmuch as his choice of descriptive perspective leads him to the "interesting" facts in the first place. On a post modern account, researchers "find facts" in the vicinity of where their interpretive frameworks point them. They "find" inasmuch as they seek in a consciously chosen fashion. If Keeley is to stand fast on his assumption that interpretations are derived from researchers' values and choices, then an appeal to "the facts" is circular and unconvinc ing.6 Put somewhat differently, this particular defense amounts to "the social-contract perspec tive is better, because I prefer it". The claim is no more persuasive in this form.7 2. The foundationalist case for a social-contract theory turns on a kind of value-neutrality that Keeley rejects at the top of his argument. Keeley eagerly, and without an abundance of subtlety, criticizes mainstream organization scien tists for being willing accomplices for managerial elites, choosing accounts about organizations that those in dominant positions will want to hear, thereby perpetuating that domination.8 Paving the way for his social-contract interpretation, he argues for an assumption that values are dis tributed more widely than the occupants of the executive suite.9 In this regards, he criticizes organization scientists for not recognizing: . . . the arbitrariness of their choice of frameworks ? a choice guided more by their own values than the values of their subjects, (p. 78) Then, at the end of a detailed argument about the kinds of rights that are pertinent in an organiza tional context ? and while acknowledging the moral position that ". . . science itself is a social practice that has effects on people . . ." (p. 105) ? Keeley pulls back, reined by some unseen tether of organization science.10 In an effort to synthesize a social-contract account with organization science, he urges his colleagues to: Assume that, as social scientists, we leave the specifica tion of which rights people should have to social participants themselves... (p. 104)</page><page sequence="4">816 Book Reviews Later, he seeks further to evade the determinancy of a right-based view in practice (p. 120), searches for a "normoral criterion of free or voluntary exchange" (p. 166), and claims: In the end, a contractual theory does not commit us to a determinate position on the voluntariness of organ izations ... (p. 186) This claim comes after a thorough, book-long argument for assuming the importance of volun tary action at the level of individual contractors, a decidedly "determinate" position. The upshot is that Keeley's pursuit of empirical validity appears to lead him to recant, without clear reasons, certain assumptions that led him to the empirical hunt in the first place. Most confus ing is the apparent assumption that "the fact that persons act on their rights" sets a boundary for what researchers can say about those rights. The confusion is wholly unnecessary. If Keeley seeks to persuade us about the extent of his interpreta tion, all he needs to do is continue with the replication efforts that he so diligently undertakes. To blithely juxtapose replication and validation is, in the context of this thesis, to create confusion.11 Second, Keeley seeks to retain certain key elements of the organization science discourse even as he is undermining the case for them as meaningful concepts. This source of confusion is manifest with respect to the concepts of organiza tional entity, organizational effectiveness (Chapter 6), and organizational design. In all three in stances, the ethical argument for a social-contract account provides sound reason for taking these concepts less seriously. 1. After reinterpreting 'organization' as a derivative concept: For evaluative purposes, every organization is much like a sewage pipe; that is, it acquires worth from its functional value to persons, whereas persons have inherent worth, (p. 205) Keeley persists in attributing properties to the "organization as a whole" (p. 225), searching for such things as a measure of the degree of volun tariness in an organization. If the case for talking about organizations in human terms ? e.g., purposes, values, contractual relations, and rights of persons ? is as necessary as Keeley claims, then the search for organizational attributes becomes superfluous. 2. After relocating the relevant context of organizational effectiveness from the organization to the individual level of analysis (p. 205), Keeley persists in his pursuit of an "impartial measure of organizational value" (p. 208) that transcends the interests of persons who he wants to admit to accounts about organization science. The result is the kind of mixed message that he provides regarding minimizing harms to persons: If one is truly concerned with the welfare of all constituents, with the organization as a whole, there is good reason to . . . temper one's search for excellence with care for those persons who wind up paying the freight, (p. 225; emphasis added) There is nothing in this concern with harms minimization that necessitates retaining the refer ence to organizational value. 3. After asserting the robustness of a social contract account There is not a lot more to be said about the configuration of any organization after one has itemized (1) the rights, privileges, powers, immunities, duties, no-rights, liabilities, and disabilities (2) under organizational, legal, cultural, and moral rules (3) of managers, workers, investors, customers, suppliers, and other participants, (p. 95) Keeley continues to emphasize the concept of organizational design ? which the "robust" inter pretation above appears to make obsolete ? as some transcendent causal means for minimizing harms to persons (p. 180). If researchers want to continue talking about the concept of organiza tional design, then why not reinterpret it as a particular kind of contractual understanding among self-interested persons? Even then, the concept as such becomes unnecessary. On all three counts, Keeley clings to the rhetoric of organization science. Curiously, he does so even after carefully providing persuasive reasons for concluding that these bellwether concepts are redundant, and hence increasingly optional. Notes I am indebted to Professors R. Edward Freeman and</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews Thelma Lavine for conversations that have helped make this argument both possible and plausible. 1 Keeley refers to organization theory instead of organ ization science. I take the two terms to be interchangeable in contemporary research practice and prefer the latter designation for reasons that become quite clear as I proceed with the review. 2 See Mentzer, M.: 1989, A Social-Contract Theory oj Organizations by Michael Keeley', Academy oj Management Review 14, 4, 602. 3 Keeley (p. 24) challenges the preference for theoretical pluralism, which is often manifest in a fascination with generating more metaphors for 'organization'. For an example of his foil, see Poole, M. S. and Van de Ven, A: 1989, 'Using Paradox to Build Management and Organ ization Theories, Academy oj Management Review 14, 4, 562-78. 4 A recent issue of the Academy oj Management Review is a vivid case in point. A perusal of the introductory article by Van de Ven, for example, will yield scant references to persons as meaningful parts of organizational stories, and nary a reference to human concerns ? e.g., aspiration, connectedness, growth. See Van de Ven, A.: 1989, 'Nothing is Quite So Practical as a Good Theory', Academy oj Management Review 14, 4, 486?89. 5 Regarding a replication strategy for justifying an argument, see Yin, R: 1984, Case Study Research: Design and Methods (Sage Publications, Beverly Hills, CA) 48?53. 6 This rather careless reconciliation of postmodern and foundationalist premisses is likely a product of the organization science assumption that any two accounts are potentially commensurable. For a careful considera tion of premisses such as this, see Hartman, E.: 1988, Conceptual Foundations oj Organization Theory (Ballinger, Cambridge, MA). 7 Stated as such, this attempt at justification bears the telltale signs of moral relativism. See Freeman, R. E. and Gilbert, D. R, Jr.: 1988, Corporate Strategy and the Search jor Ethics (Prentic-Hill, Englewood Cliff, NJ), Chapter 2. 8 Keeley addresses this concern on pp. 51?3 and pp. 102-6. 9 For a discussion of this assumption in the context of strategic management theory, see Freeman, R. E., Gilbert, D. R, Jr., and Hartman. E.: 1988, 'Values and the Founda tions of Strategic Management', Journal oj Business Ethics 7, 821-34. 10 Keeley goes no further with this particular moral issue, preferring instead to limit the scope of "conversa tion" to organization science researchers. In this respect, Keeley's project is akin to Donald McCloskey's entertain ing rhetorical-criticism of modern economics. See McCloskey, D.: 1985, The Rhetoric oj Economics (Uni versity of Wisconsin Press, Madison, WI) While both projects are postmodern, neither one is a pragmatist effort. That is, neither Keeley nor McCloskey chooses to extend the conversation to include those who might bear the moral effects of the discourses of organization science and economics, respectively. 11 McCloskey provides an apt caution in this regard, arguing that ? far from being an undisciplined intel lectual activity ? rhetorical criticism can be understood as: ... an invitation to leave the irrationality of an artifi cially narrowed range of argument and to move to the rationality of arguing like human beings. See McCloskey supra note 10 at 36. On this account, no other "real" kind of justification is required. DANIEL R. GILBERT, JR.
