<plain_text><page sequence="1">-I 32 IIINA / THE DEVELOPMENT OF PAINTING IN RUSSIA By THEODOR SCHMIT Director of the Institute of Art History, Leningrad The history of Russian art has not yet become at all familiar to the art historian. Naturally, comprehensive handbooks cannot get along without a chapter on "mediaeval" Russian art, and this chapter is likely to be accompanied with some striking illustra- tions, but there is never any discussion of a course of development that is at all analo- gous to the course of development of any other art. Even au- thors who write spe- cial books on Russian art are just as help- less before the prob- lem. Louis Reau ques- tions whether one should speak of Rus- sian art at all, for as he sees it there is really only Byzantine art and then Euro- pean art in R u s s i a. And a Russian author, P. Muratov, expresses the opinion that the Russians a r e a re- markable example of - an imitative people, who have never known an archaic art, have had no artistic begin- nings, but must al- ways take on a style of foreign growth in which to express them- selves. In all text- books of Russian art history that are cir- e culated in Russia it- self one reads that the f f state, art, and culture in general commenced in the tenth and elev-- enth centuries in Kiev and Novgorod by taking over what the Vikings and Byzan- tines had created; that then in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in Vladimir and Suzdal a Byzantine-Romanesque art ap- peared, which was imported ready-made, possibly directly from the Orient on the great Volga trade route, possibly from West Europe; that in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries Novgorod went through a golden age of late Byzantine Palaeologian art; that in the last quarter of the fifteenth century the great Muscovite prince Ivan III imported his artists as well as his bride from Italy; that in the sixteenth century under Ivan IV Asiatic tendencies got the upper hand in Moscow; and that finally in Moscow in the seventeenth century and eventually in Petersburg of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Russian art had become wholly European, so that Russian works of art were imported in their turn into Western Europe. If this were the whole truth, obviously we could not talk of a distinct division into periods of Russian art history; in the clas- sification of the history of Russian art we would simply have to note what influence was decisive, and speak of a Middle Byzan- tine, a Romanesque, a Late Byzantine, an Italian, an Asiatic, a half-European, and a European period. It is clear, however, that in this case the stages of development which we are accustomed to look upon as typical in the historical progress of art; that is pre-Romanesque, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque, have no significance for Russia; in spite of the pains to which so many Russian scholars have been, Russian art monuments could not be forced into the Procrustean bed of the division into periods valid for Western Europe. We can, to be sure, concern ourselves with another series of facts, and take our point of departure not so much from the foreign influences as from the characteristic life of the people, but here too we arrive at a division of periods which does not coin- cide with the European division. We find, that at the beginning of the ninth century Russian history began with a thoroughgoing social crisis which made it possible for the Vikings of the northwest and the Khazars of the southeast to subjugate the whole country; out of this crisis rose the flourish- ing and powerful empire of Vladimir and Yaroslav, which was to fall a little later, in the course of the N|" ~ ~ twelfth century. Four centuries after the first crisis the coun- *d ??

And again after four hundred ye a r s there followed another crisis, which was marked by the "Smuta," the "period of chaos," of the first twenty years of the seventeenth century, and after which the new Russia unfolded, finally became really amenable to the Eu- ropean manner, and with each succeeding decade took ever more lively part in Euro- pean life. Thus, from this point of view also, the evolution of Russia is very differ- ent from that of other European countries. Anno 6495 (ie., 987), says the Kiev chronicler, Prince Vladimir called his men in consultation and told them that ambas- sadors had come to him from various neigh- bors and had each recommended to him a different faith; thereupon the assembly de- cided to send trustworthy men to these neighbors to investigate their creeds; after a long time the confidential agents returned and pronounced the finest faith to be that of the Greeks, and it was then Vladimir de- iPARNASSUS 32</page><page sequence="2">33 cided to join the Greek church. Naturally. we need not take this narration of an e1eventh century Grecophile Kiev monk ab- solutely literally. Yet there is a good deal of historical truth in it; no one imitates anything foreign if it is not entirely agre-- able to him, that is, if it does not meet his needs; and each takes from his neighbors only that which he himself would have to create if he could not find it ready-made somewhere. The princes of Kiev could not build up a state so long as the populace was committed to a chaotic cult of demons; the princes needed personified, anthropomorphic nature gods. Before Vladimir turned to Byzantine Christianity he made an attempt to support himself vrith a newly organized heathen pantheon. Only when this first at- tempt at a religious reform miscarried did Vladimir import Christianity, whose heav- enly hierarchy could serve as a model for the state, and whose earthly hierarchy, the priests and the monks, must in a hostile land work with all their might for the sov- ereigns, because they would otherwise be left high and dry. That Vladimir chose Byzantine Christianity rather than Roman was, to be sure, the result of the lively trade relationships between Kiev and By- zantium, but, in any case, this choice best suited the political interests of the sover- eign; it was not from the bottom upwards but from the top downwards that Christian- ity penetrated Russia, and centuries later we still continue to hear of bloody revolts of the masses against this religion, which constituted a powerful tool for the state, after the Byzantine model, not an organ;- zation of the masses against the state, after the Roman manner. If, however, Christianity was a powerful tool, and the church a state organization for disciplining the masses, Byzantine church art could only be a means of propaganda, with the help of which state and church could bring the masses to submission. Hence, this church art may not really be looked upon as a na- tional Russian art but only as the art of the lords of the land, and consequently it is im- material whether this art was executed by foreign, imported masters or by their na- tive pupils (already at the end of the eleventh century we hear of a famous Rus- sian painter in Kiev, the Kiev monk Alypios), and whether the inscriptions are composed in Greek or in Russian (after the twelfth century Greek inscriptions disap- peared in Russia, as in Italy). Only when, in the twelfth centurv, the power of the princes began to weaken and other classes of the population gained the upper hand did Byzantine aristocratic art decline, and the brief so-called Byzantine-Romanesque episode of Russian art history begin. From the standpoint of the Greco-Russian monks, to whom we are indebted for the old- est Russian chronicles, Russian history of the eleventh and twelfth centuries presents itself as though there were really only sov- ereigns and lords bol'are, along with whom there are occasionally mentioned, in second place, saints, bishops, and abbots. Only be- cause these rulers, in order to rule, must be placed over sub+jects, there also appear in the account '4men"-druzina) or "townsmen' or, exceptionally, a variety of sorcerers and other insurgents. Just so does the earliest Russian history appear also to history writers of the nineteenth century, who with the famous "calling of the Varangi" began not the history of the Norman-Byzantine state affairs in Russia, but the history of Russia in general; and so even today do those art historians think who have the his- tory of Russian art commence with the re- ception of the Byzantine official church art and conceive of everything before that merely as wholly static prehistory. Such ideas are untenable, even from the stand- point of the chronicles, and yet more so from the standpoint of archaeological facts. Widespread Art Activity in Ancient Russia Before there were any princes in Nov- gorod and Kiev, before bishops and abbots had brick churches built, icons painted, and books written, there were everywhere in Russia, according to obvious indications of the chronicles, towns that carried on trade and industry. The moment that there was felt the imperative need of the organiza- tion of a powerful military protection the towns (e. g.} Novgorod) at once took the initiative of the "calling of the Varangi,?' i. e., created a military cast, a sort of thing which had obviously not previously existed in the country. This military cast forthwith became overpowerful as a matter of course, but one needs only read the chronicle atten- tively to ascertain that the towns energeti- cally intervened more and more in the pro- gress of state affairs as time went on, and even in the quarrels of the princes. This was true not only in the remote towns but even in Kiev itself, stronghold of the Nor- man princes and the Byzantine bishops. In- deed, the Kiev chronicler, who in the com- position of his work shows very definite po- litical prejudices, is forced to pass over dec- ades of the history of towns and regions, be- cause he would otherwise have to report facts which were in direct opposition to his point of view and which would show clearly that the matter of the unity of the Russian Christian monarchy, as it was idealized by the Byzantine monks, was by no mean.s in such a brilliant status as the monks wished it. The extraordinarily rapid rise of the power of the Norman princes and the re- markably successful adoption of Byzantine church art had been possible because eastern Europe of the ninth to twelfth century was not inhabited by savages, by prehistoric primitilre men without social organization and without art and culture. The earliest history of Russia is rooted deep in the his- tory of the Scytho-Sarmathian peoples. The linguistic paleontologist N. Marr discovers ever new deep-lying strata of speech in the now widely spread Finnish idioms of the va- rious peoples settled in eastern Europe, and definitely establishes linguistic connections which show that we have to do with a geo- graphic-ally enormous primitive stratum o-f autochthons, which conceivably shifts slowly but does not emigrate and immigrate sud- SAINT STEPHEN From Post of Royal Doors Moscow School Late XVI Century PARNASSUS</page><page sequence="3">- 34I PARNAE?? I ~ denly in mass. That the peoples of the east European plains had already in pre-Chris- tian times received from the South impulses of Greek art and culture, that the east Euro- pean plains had great rivers streaming through them, which from ancient times were well known and much traveled highways of trade, that from the Northwest the German races penetrated, from the Southwest the Slavic, from the East all kinds of Asiatics- all this is firmly established. How can one then believe that this variegated "prehistory" had no influence at all on the original races and peoples, which yet were directly and strongly affected by the events of this "pre- history." Even if we know nothing certainly, we must assume that the autochthonos rural population of Russia in the ninth century possessed at least geometric peasant art, like that which we still come across today in the remote parts of the U. S. S. R. and that the immigrant townsmen had certainly already reached the higher stage of the animal orna- ment of the so-called era of migrations. Be- cause in the history of Russian art it has been customary to call attention to only the monuments of the "high" Byzantine art, the unpretentious and scarce residue of the old- est peasant art as also of the animal orna- ment has hitherto been thrown aside and ig- nored as useless archaeological rubbish. And yet there have lately been found among the chaos of museum refuse many things that confirm our assumption. I am glad to be able to refer here to the work of A. S. Gustsins in which this material is finally systematically assembled. On the oldest monuments of animal orna- ment of which the chronology is definitely established, in the tenth to twelfth century, we find not the very beginnings but a well ordered system of forms and techniques, which with the passage of time were no- ticeably and continuously developed fur- ther. First of all come personal adornment, bracelets, ear rings, and the like, utensils, drinking horns, etc., and weapons. When Byzantine art came in animal ornament took a decidedly subordinate place. But as early as the second half of the eleventh century the penetration of this "barbarian" art into church art begins to be noticeable. Inter- lace, with parts of plants, animals, and men, appears in the initials and borders of the manuscripts, and two centuries later, approximately from the middle of the thir- tenth century to the end of the fourteenth, there is no more Byzantine ornament at all in the manuscripts! The domain of the in- terlace and the animal ornament came to extend much further: in the twelfth century and in the first half of the thirteenth it spread its dominance over the facades of the stone churches of Vladimir and Suzdal, where earlier a purely symbolic religious art of representation had been drawn into the decorative system. Under such circum- stances, is it necessary to explain through imitation the appearance of "Romanesque" forms in Vladimir, Suzdal, Yuriev-Polskii in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries? Is it not clear, as soon as one considers minor archaeological objects, manuscripts, and stone reliefs not as separate and inde- pendent, but as the artistic expression of a definite social class, that we have here to do with the social growth of just that class, which with the fall of the princely tyranny took in its own hands the affairs of the church and literature and with that brought out its own aesthetic preference inherited from the migration period? It has been shown that Sassanian motives may be traced in the reliefs of Vladimir and Yuriev- Polskii-it must not be forgotten, however, that Sassanian art had been dead half a mil- lenium when the Russian reliefs were made! The Russian reliefs have been compared with the decorative stone carving of Georgia and Armenia-as to that, however, it has been proved that with all the similarity the Russian repertory of forms in no way coin- cides with that of the Caucasus. A way has been sought in which West European stone cutters could have penetrated Russia; it must be admitted, to be sure, that the Rus- sian court of the eleventh to thirteenth cen- tury was in communication with Byzantium as well as with the Caucasus and West Eu- rope, and that the trade routes of the Volga, the Dnieper, the Nieman. and the Dvina, which cut through Russia, were and remained entirely practicable. And yet the assumption that the princes of Vladimir had masters come from France who brought in an entirely foreign decorative art that was I E. and A.

One has only to use a much simpler explanation, and take into account that in the archaeological finds, the manu- scripts, and the stone carvings accidentally preserved,-because accidentally carried out in durable material,-there are the remains of a primitive and widely spread organically developed art practiced in the early Russian towns, which in time freed themselves from the Norman-Byzantine tyranny, and made their own the Christianity forced upon them by the princes and bishops. They carried forward the aristocratic art, brought about a serious crisis in the Early Russian social order, and finally produced a new culture in the Middle Russian period, (the thirteenth to sixteenth century,) in the flourishing city republics of Novgorod, Pskov, and else- where. This was a distinctly new culture and art, which was eventually absorbed and synthesized by Moscow. This whole process of development must not be thought uniform and all-inclusive; schematic simplification must be avoided here just as much as in the study of the Early Russian period. After more than a thousand years of variegated history which has been enacted in Russia since the sum- moning of the Northmen, there are living and trading with each other in the U.S.S.R. of today peoples and classes of society in the most varied stages of social and artis- tic development. Today the U.S.S.R. is still an enormous museum of cultural history, where social and artistic forms, which we are accustomed to think of as following each other in time, from palaeolithic to the twentieth century Europe, stand ab- ruptly side by side in space (ethnographic!) and can be studied. In many regions of the U.S.S.R. there still persists the most primi- tive "wood period," where metal is only a rare and curious importation. And in the same regions the most gigantic electrical works may be carried out, aeroplanes fly through the air, and people seek the highest possible forms of social organization! The whole history of Russia is a constant repe- tition of how new social classes free them- selves from the masses of primitive men to rise rapidly. If one realizes all this, one easily under- stands that it is impossible to talk of a uni- fied art development in Russia. Art is a means of expression and a means of under- standing and therefore always corresponds to social needs. In a land where different classes of population and different parts of the country are on fundamentally different cultural levels, there must be contemporan- eously just as many styles of art as there are social groups and classes. These styles of art necessarily become more distinct the more slowly the groups or classes are de- veloped, affording more time to work out specific forms of expression. Conversely, the rapidly progressing groups and classes will have the least time and leisure to keep their artistic language always up to date with their own resources; they will, there- fore, in order to spare themselves creative work, have to content themselves with any kind of art that approximately corresponds to their own needs and that they are able to borrow somehow ready-made from the more advanced neighbors they are emulat- ing. If the art historian proposes to reckon only with the upper class, as almost all his- torians of Russian art have hitherto done, he must, of course, first of all raise the question of whether one has any right to speak of Russian art and not rather of By- zantine or later West European art in Rus- sia. I have noted already, at the beginning of this article, that Louis R6au raised pre- OUR LADY OF THE DON In the Cathedral of the Annunciation at Moscow XIV Century cisely this question in his book L'art russe des origines d Pierre le Grand (Paris, 1921). He came to the conclusion that one may in- deed speak of Russian art, because the Rus- sian artists have not been satisfied simply to copy their models: "they adapt them to their needs and to their traditions, they combine them in original syntheses." That is correctly observed, and it means that the foreign "imitated" art was not planted in a barbarian, inartistic milieu, but was taken over as an expedient by a rapidly develop- ing class of society, to serve first as a model, then to be subjected to as more or less thorough working over, and finally to be changed into a fixed, hieratic tradition. Only thus is Middle Russian art history to be understood. The thirteenth century is a very dark period in the development of Russian art, and one from which we have only very few monuments. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries we are surprised by a wonderful florescense, in icon painting as well as in monumental wall painting. In the fore- ground are the two city republics Novgorod and Pskov; but the connoisseur of icons learns better every day to distinguish in ad- dition to these two metropolises a series of other towns where art was not only appre- ciated but created. When one has once been freed of the superstition that Russian his- tory must be forced absolutely chronologi- cally into the period arrangement of Euro- pean history, and when determined to take account of the facts, and to assume for Rus- sian historical development not a distinct course but a distinct pace, one cannot help paralleling the Middle Russian period with the classical history of Greece; Novgorod and Pskov play some such r6le as the com- mercial and industrial centers, Athens and Corinth; but Moscow plays the role at first of agricultural, war-like Sparta, and later of Macedonia, until finally in the course of events, developing with cinematograph- like rapidity, Moscow becomes a Rome, the "third Rome," in which the Muscovites of the sixteenth century themselves so earn- estly believed. That this is more than a simple, capricious comparison is proved by a careful analysis of the style of the art work of the Middle Byzantine period so richly represented in our store of monu- ments. In the "high" art of this period we have to deal above all with a renewed taking over of Byzantine forms, this time in their char- acteristic late Byzantine phase of the so- called Palaeologian period; no mosaics, no monumental forms, no single figures, but compositions of many figures in crowded se- ries, with narrative content. It was actually a genuine Byzantine master that trans- planted the new style to Novgorod and later also to Moscow, Theophanes the Greek, who in the last quarter of the fourteenth cen- tury decorated the Church of the Transfigu- ration in Novgorod with the still extant wall paintings, and at Moscow at the end of the fourteenth century and in the first years of the fifteenth decorated a whole series of churches and was famous as a painter of easel pictures and miniatures. A pupil of this Theophanes was Andrei Rubl'ov, the first distinct artistic personality of Middle Russian painting. Again real Byzantines must have come to Moscow, probably, in the last quarter of the fifteenth century, when Ivan III got from Rome the princess appa- rent of the Byzantine empire, Zoi-Sophia, for his bride. Direct imitation can there- fore no more be denied for the beginning of Middle Russian art, at least in the field of the "high" art, than for the Early Rus- sian period. But a careful stylistic analysis shows the enormous difference between the ways in which Byzantine art was received by the Russian masters the two times; dur- ing the whole Early Russian period we have to do really with a Byzantine art in Russia, in connection with which only the concept "Byzantine" need be grasped! V. M. Maso- iedov has shown very clearly and strikingly in his stylistic criticism in the introduction to the publication of the Nereditza wall paint- ings how these series of frescoes done in the last years of the twelfth century are still to be associated with the most varied Byzantine local schools and actually form a repertorium of the most heterogenous pro- vincial stylistic forms that are to be found in the sphere of influence of Byzantine art of the twelfth century. The painting of pre- Mongolian Russia is, as we have seen in our 3 1 1 L 7 t r L t II I I I I t I I I I I i I I 1 I1 I i 4 35 PARNASSUb</page><page sequence="5">in36 PARNAISU~ study of the development of animal orna- ment, just an art of the princely rulers, not only beyond the appreciation of the peas- ants, but as little understandable and con- genial to the masses of city folk. All this is otherwise in the Middle Russian period: the Saviour, the Mother of God, and the saints have ceased forming a compact hier- archy, and as local patrons of the various city republics have become altogether popu- lar; a Russian national church, which is only loosely connected with the ecumenical church of Constantinople and which follows its own ideals and political aims, has become deeply rooted; the art of the church has ac- quired citizenship, and the townsmen are in no way minded to be subjected to the Byzan- tine fashion. This is shown very clearly in the architecture, into which, with the Italian Renaissance architects called by Ivan III, entirely un-Byzantine elements penetrated even in the last quarter of the fifteenth cen- tury, and which in the sixteenth century, in the time of Vassilii III and Ivan IV, was completely emancipated from Byzantine models, even in church building. This inde- pendence is shown just as clearly in paint- ing, which in its content is not in the least absorbed in the tragic gloominess of the later Palaeologian art, preferring, rather, a gay brilliancy of color and making use of the Byzantine chiaroscuro painting only for coloristic effects, while it really lays the whole emphasis on linear, rhythmic drawing, which does not in the least belie its direct derivation from the interlace and animal ornament. Anyone who understands all that our ancient literary sources report concern- ing the very fine linear treatment of the Greek mural and easel paintings of the fifth and fourth centuries B. C. may ignore the stylistically very dissimilar Pompeian wall paintings, which are only superficial imita- tions of the classical prototypes, and turn his attention to the works of the Middle Russian masters. And whoever wishes to appreciate Middle Russian icon painting must look at it with eyes unprejudiced by either Byzantine or Renaissance painting and judge it by the standards of Greek vase paintings, and perhaps also Japanese wood- cuts. In spite of Theophanes the Greek and other immigrant Byzantine masters whose names are unknown, Middle Russian painting is by no means to be understood as Byzantine art in Russia. In any case, one cannot put Mid- dle Russian painting in the same category with Byzantine except on condition that one is emphasizing, in the customary and still usual way, the theological subject matter, the ecclesiastically traditional, and the icon- ography, and beyond that only if one has an eye merely for single forms, like the curly- headed figures of the Palaeologian period, and for the technique (tempera painting). Middle Russian painting cannot be under- stood in this way. One must not forget that it is not here a question of specific church art but simply a question of the art of townspeople-icons are panel paint- ings that decorate church and home, and the miracle scenes from the Evangelium and le- gends of the saints represented on them merely indicate the usual circle of interest of the citizen of the Middle Russian period, just as in other periods and in other coun- tries nude female figures or landscapes or battle scenes are favored. No one thinks of assuming that because a Greek vase painter sketched in a drinking cup Eos weeping over Memnon the ancient Greeks were naive children in the fifth century who enjoyed exclusively the legends of the gods and he- roes. An icon on which is represented the elegant George the Dragon Killer with his beautiful princess certainly served in its day and for its public the purpose that we expect today from an extravagant French love story. In the consideration of art it is much less a question of what than of how, there is nothing to take exception to in this definition except the failure to mention the fine and expressive lines, which here, in this transitional period from abstract, ornamen- tal drawing in illusionistic painting play ex- actly the same r6le as in the classical cen- turies of Greece in the passage from the Dipylon period to Hellinism. It is just this rhythmic play of line, of no use to repre- sentation, or often disturbing or even dis- torting the representation, which principally distinguishes Middle Russian art from By- zantine Palaeologian art, which is thor- oughly pictorial and strives for representa- tive truth to nature just like the Early Italian Renaissance. In classical Greece and in Russia of the fifteenth and sixteenth cen- OUR LADY OF VLADIMIR Byzantine. XII Century. Moscow and it is difficult to see why we should re- nounce all our critical criteria in the study of Russian art. Russian painting of the fifteenth and six- teenth centuries is not in the least primi- tive. On the contrary, it may rather be called refined. Naturalistic objectivity plays no role with the painter, he sacrifices it without regret to a finely balanced sys- tem of linear rhythm, which is welded to- gether by spots of color into a rhythmic system of silhouettes, yet in such a way that the lines never cease to sing distinctly their own melodies. When N. Trubetskoi characterizes Middle Russian panel paint- ing as a conception of the world in color, turies the line is expressive per se, an artis- tic end in itself; in Byzantium, however, it merely serves as a means of representation. It sounds like a paradox and is yet true that Middle Russian art is much less "primitive" than its Byzantine preceptor: the latter made the first advance toward an illusionis- tic, realistic painting and then blundered ahead without consideration; Middle Rus- sian art, on the other hand, cultivated the specialty of an abstract linear style of art many centuries old and rich in traditions and is superrefined and purposive. Russian art was to become really primitive only much later, when in the seventeenth century in its turn it renounced abstract drawing and turned to realistic representation. 36 PAARNASSUS~</page><page sequence="6">I I 3 - Unfortunately, to the dark centuries be- | seventeenth century it is the feudal petty longs the sixteenth, the century of Vasilii nobility and the commercial cities of cen- III and Ivan IV.

Only one monument, the church of the Therapon monastery in the region of the White Sea, constructed during the very first years of the sixteenth century, a fore- runner of the golden age of Ivan IV, has been preserved in all its original splendor; we have good examples from the very end of the sixteenth century, in the Novodevitzii monastery in Moscow (1598), in the cathe- dral of Solvychegodsk (1600), and in the church of the great Kyrillos monastery in the vicinity of the White Sea (1602) In the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nine- teenth centuries Russian art rushed through the whole stretch that European art had leisurely wandered through since the early Middle Ages. Naturally, this was not a pro- gressive movement of the whole mass of people, scattered over an enormous territory and living under wholly different conditions. We have already emphasized the fact that even today the U.S.S.R. is an enormous mu- seum of cultural history, where all stages of culture from palaeolithic times to the European twentieth century are uninter- ruptedly and richly represented. In the occupy whole quarters of Moscow, and not only of Moscow, all this indicates a multi- tude of new impulses, which even broke the crippling power of the tradition that had dominated the art of the church, and out- side the church art led to the formation of a secular art which soon gained the upper hand. The splendid series of frescoes of Yaroslavl, Kostroma, etc., from the second half of the seventeenth century are still found in the churches and still relate Bib- lical stories and the legends of the saints, but show a thoroughly worldly attitude of the artists and consequently of their pa- trons and employers. Yet more worldly are the products of portrait painting, parsun- noje pisjmo, rapidly coming into favor, which emancipated itself very quickly from the restraining forms of icon painting. In this manner the way was prepared for the reception of European Baroque art, which set in strongly in the reign of Peter the Great, at the turn of the seventeenth cen- tury. There are art historians who let themselves be so blinded by the fame of the art work and artists imported into Russia in the beginning of the eighteenth century that they completely forget the preceding national development, look upon the court art of Petersburg as Russian art in general, and introduce into the history of Russian art foreigners that should not be mentioned in it. It is true that many immigrant ar- tists worked for the Russian court and the court circle in the course of the eighteenth century. It is true that in the capital mod- ern works of art made a great impression on the whole body of artists. But the ac- ceptance of European art in the eighteenth century, again, is not to be judged as a slavish imitation, but as such foreign intro- ductions should always be considered; a whole stratum of society has separated it- self from the mass of people, rises up rap- idly and accomplishes the enormous task to be performed, in the very shortest time, be- cause it finds the path of progress already smoothed, and is able to make use of the experiences of other peoples. Strangers brought the European practice of art to Russia in the eighteenth century, and again we find that the foreign style was immediately subjected to such a re- working that it really attained to a more or less Russian appearance and, in any case. became clearly differentiated from the orig- inal European art products. The foreign seed fell on ground that was not only rich but also well prepared. Very quickly the forms of Baroque art penetrated from the capital into the provinces.

The education of the masses cannot be restricted to the merely negative fight against deeply rooted habits and vices. A new civilization must be brought to the people, a new way of comprehending life and all reality, a new way of feeling, think- ing, and acting, a new way of looking at things, which corresponds to the new way of producing things. This new way of look- ing at things can only be realized by art. That which in Russian history of the past foreigners have done again and again for the leading upper class of Russian society, enabling this leading upper class to rise rapidly, must now be done by the upper class for all the lower classes, in order that these too may finally go forward rapidly. Art in the U.S.S.R. of today has ceased to be a thing of luxury for connoisseurs and ama- teurs; it has become a serious work of cul- ture involving great responsibility. Parties, leagues, government, and all people who feel the modern trend are one in the con- viction that a far reaching and thoroughgo- ing cultural revolution must be prosecuted by the participation of all powers, if we are to go forward. Now a cultural revolution, when it concerns a hundred and fifty mil- lion people, is a tremendous undertaking, which can only be carried through in any measurable period of time if we actually try to get at this hundred and fifty million peo- ple from all sides and with all means. The efficacy of art in this movement must not be undervalued. For this reason art has become a state aSair with us; for this rea- son art is not directed by a separate de- partment but by the commission for na- tional instruction; for this reason the gov- ernment has created two special institu- tions for aesthetic research, the academy in Moscow and the institute, which I have the honor to direct, in Leningrad. Art history has likewise become an affair of the state, because only the history of art teaches us to distinguish in each given case the stage of development, because only the history of art can show the mechanism of the develop- ment of art, because only on the basis of the history of art can practical measures be theoretically examined beforehand and passed upon. We art historians have not yet progressed far enough that we can make the effective contribution to the state that it expects of us, but we realize that we are not engaged and must not be engaged merely in amateurship, but in purposeful efFort. The colossal activity in collecting and research that has been going on since 1917 and will continue will be manifest in our exhibition of Early Russian art. What I have told here oP the evolution of Rus- sian painting is a sketch of the problem, partly local, partly general which we face and toward the solution of which we are working.
