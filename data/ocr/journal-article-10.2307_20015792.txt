This volume (hereafter CML) is a companion to the classic earlier work An Introduction to Modal Logic (Methuen, 1968, SBN 416-29470-7, 416-29460-X Pbk.) by the same authors. This earlier work (hereafter IML) was an almost encyclopedic volume, treating a vast number of individual systems of modal logic, and presenting a variety of styles and techniques. It might fairly be said that IML aimed to present essentially everything that was known about modal logic at the time of its publication, and that it came remarkably close to fulfilling that objective. It's bibliography was extremely comprehensive. By 1984, however, it was already patently impossible to encompass ev erything that was known about modal logic, or even everything that had been learned since 1968, in a single volume. Accordingly, CML is not con ceived in the same encyclopedic tradition that was so impressive in IML. Instead, CML aims "to concentrate on certain recent developments which concern questions about general properties of modal systems...". The au thors have chosen to confine attention to the central core of modal logic, namely normal systems of modal logic with a single independent modal op erator. This excludes many interesting developments in modal logic, such as work on tense logic, dynamic logic, counterfactual conditionals, graded modalities, polymodal systems, systems weaker than K, and semantically complex operators. Nonetheless a thorough understanding of this central core will be essential to a full appreciation of these further developments. The authors have endeavored to maintain continuity with the contents and notation of IML. As in IML, the necessitation operator is called L and the possibilitation operator M, in the tradition made popular by Prior, rather than Ol and O respectively, as in the tradition made popular by Lem mon and Scott. The authors have made a few modest changes in notational conventions where some clear improvements have been possible severe de parture from the style of IML. In particular, various schemata and rules are now identified by names that have become fairly standard in the literature since the publication of IML, particularly through the influence of Lemon and Scott's Notes on Modal Logic. On the other hand they consciously de cline to adopt the Lemon/Scott system of naming normal modal systems Studia Logica 54: 411-424, 1995. ? 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Where changes have been adopted, they are carefully explained in footnotes, with helpful references to IML. In the interests of generality, CML includes the weakest normal system K, where JML had taken the system T (KT in the Lemmon/Scott terminology) as the basic system of alethic modal logic. There is distinctly less reliance in CML than in IML on talk of one world's "seeing" another, which this reviewer always found distractingly anthropomorphic. IML had an extensive bibliography. CML has only a modest 3 page bibli ography of important more recent works, with only one article and one book from the IML bibliography repeated in the CML bibliography. Where CML has references to work described in IML, it cites the appropriate passages of IML and depends on the reader to track down the references there to the ap propriate entries in the IML bibliography. This can be mildly inconvenient for the reader who has ready access to IML and can be a serious problem for a reader who does not. In this respect the authors fall a bit short of their stated aim of making CML a self-contained work. CML has 9 chapters. The first introduces the essentials of syntax and the concepts of model, validity, and soundness for normal propositional modal systems. The second introduces the concepts of consistency, completeness and determination, defines canonical models, and gives Henkin-style com pleteness and determination proofs for a variety of simple systems. The dis cussion here makes it clear that every normal systems has canonical modal by which it is determined and thus is complete (though perhaps not sound) with respect to any class of models containing the canonical model. It is one of the admirable features of this work that it gives such a clear presentation of canonical models and completeness within such a short compass. The first two chapters take only 40 pages, and in fact we have the essentials clearly expounded within the first 25 pages. This feature alone would make the work useful in the classroom. Chapter 3 introduces the generalized Geach schema G', namely MmLnp D LJMk p, and proves that it corresponds to the generalized convergence (called incestuality in the Lemon/Scott tradi tion) constraint on the accessibility relation. It also mentions that Sahlqvist has shown determination results for all schemata of the from Ln(at D 3), where a is constructed from literals, and ,3 from positive literals, using L, M, V and *, and operator other than or L ever lies inside the scope of any occurrence of L within a. The authors do not state the correspond ing constraint on models. This is regrettable, since the original paper by Sahlqvist is not readily available to all readers and is not easily digested,</page><page sequence="3">Books Received 413 once found. Chapter 3 also discusses conditions on the accessibility rela tion, such as reflexivity, asymmetry, antisymmetry, that do not correspond to any schema, but which come "free". Thus for example, when a normal system S is determined by a class C of models, it will also be determined by the narrower class C of irreflexive models from C. Chapter 4 introduces the question how, if at all, we might define a non-trivial absolute notion of completeness for a system, in contrast to the notion of completeness with respect to a class C of models, and uses this question to motivate the in troduces of frames. It then defines absolute completeness as the existence of the class of frames with respect to which the systems is complete. A simple example of an incomplete system, due to van Benthem, is presented. Finally, the chapter introduces generalized frames. Chapter 5 introduces the concepts of equivalence of models and of frames, pseudo-epimorphisms, dis tinguishable models, and generated frames, and gives basic results. Chapter 6 is concerned with characterizing the class of all frames in which a system is valid, and also discusses systems that are not canonical, in the sense that they are not valid in the frame of their canonical model, and systems that are not compact, in the sense that not every S-consistent set of formulas is satisfied at a world in a frame in which S is valid. Chapter 7 concerns what are authors call subordination frames. Roughly speaking, a subordination frame is one constructed to contain a world satisfying a given consistent for mula, by starting with such a world adding others methodically as needed to meet the definition of satisfaction. Chapter 8 covers finite models , fil trations, the finite model and finite frame properties, and decidability. It also illustrates how filtration methods can be used to prove completeness for some non-canonical systems. Chapters 1 through 8 are concerned with propositional modal logic. Chapter 9 treats modal predicate logic, limiting attention to systems containing the Barcan Formula (Vxx)La D L(Vxx)oa. A completeness proof is given for a simplest such system, and related results are discussed. A 6 page glossary and a list of axioms for systems of propositional modal logic are appended at the end of the book, together with a useful index. A modest number of exercises are given at the end of each chapter except the first. This is a well-written and useful work, suitable for use as a text, and helpful as a reference work on basic techniques in modal logic. Mark A. Brown</page></plain_text>
