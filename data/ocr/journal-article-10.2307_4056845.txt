<plain_text><page sequence="1">AL-KASIM IBN IBRAHIM'S THEORY OF THE IMAMATE* BY BINYAMIN ABRAHAMOV AL-KASIM ibn Ibr&amp;him ibn Isma'il ibn IbrThim ibn al-Hasan ibn tX al-Hasan ibn 'All was born in 169/785. The biographical sources provide no information about his youth, but he probably grew up in al- Madina. Al-Kasim came to Egypt before 199/815 and stayed there till 211/826. The reason for his coming to Egypt is uncertain. One source indicates that he was sent to Egypt by his brother Muhammad to gain recruits who would swear allegiance to the latter, but other sources make no mention of any such recruiting mission in Egypt. Also, al-Kasim was not likely to have prepared a rebellion in Egypt, as is related by later Zaydite sources, in addition to his religious activity (see below). After leaving Egypt al-Kasim settled in al-Rass near al-Madina where he died in 246/860. Al-Kasim appears in his writings as a teacher and preacher of the true religion, and its defender against internal enemies (oppressors, sinners, anthropomorphists) and external enemies as well (philosophers, Christians, Manicheans). He was influenced to a large extent by Mu'tazi- lism and his writings paved the way for the acceptance of Mu'tazilite doctrines by the later Zaydites of Yemen. Al-Kasim's main theological subjects are as follows: the arguments for the existence of God and the creation of the world, God's unity and qualities, theodicy, belief and unbelief, the imamate1. I The aim of this article is to examine al-Kasim's theory of the imamate, comprising three main themes: a. The obligation to appoint an imam b. * The present article is a revised version of a chapter of my Ph.D. thesis, originally written in Hebrew, on the theological epistles of al-Kasim ibn Ibrahim. The work was carried out under the supervision of Prof. M. Schwarz. 1 See W. Madelung, Der Imam al-Qasim ibn Ibrdhim und die Glaubenslehre der Zaiditen, Berlin 1965, pp. 86-96. B.

At the beginning of his discussion of the imamate question in al-Kasim Madelung asserts: &lt;&lt;Al-Kasim does not mention the imamate question in his five principles 2. It is indirectly interwoven in the fifth principle, and in most of the rest of his works he does not deal with it at all. Evidently it was not his special concern. Certainly he was a Zaidite to such an extent that he considered the wrong decision concerning the succession to the Prophet the source of all evils in Islam. Yet the consequences of this fault seemed to him much graver than the fault itself. Al-Kasim's adherents were clearly much more interested in the imamate question than al- Kasim himself. Quite a few questions that were directed to him dealt with the imamate. In response to a question about the necessity of the imamate and the sign indicating the legitimate imam al-Kasim composed his Kitab tathbit al-imdma (see below)3&gt;&gt;. However, the fact that al-Kasim does not mention the imamate question in his five principles of Islam does not prove that &lt;&lt;it was not his special concern&gt;&gt;. Furthermore, the question of emigration from the abode of unjust people does not figure as a principle, although al-Kasim deems it very important and devotes a long epistly entitled Kitdb al-hidjra to it. In contradistinction to this, the third principle, the promise and the threat, occupies little space in his writings. As a rule, the relative importance of al-Kasim's notions need not be evaluated according to the criterion of his five principles, since the latter do not sum up all his views, but, as Madelung notes, do contain a summary of most of his argu- ments4. Most of al-Kasim's theological epistles deal with the first two principles, God's unity and God's justice. The imamate question, not in its political aspect 5, occupies an important position in al-Kasim, and he devoted several works to it: 2 The five principles of Islam according to al-Kasim are as follows: a. God is one b. God is just c. God both promises and threatens d. The Kur'an is a homogeneous book without contradictions, and the Sunna is what is mentioned in the Kur'an and what the Kur'an intends e. It is forbidden, where oppressors rule, to use property and to engage in commerce and profits making. See al-Kasim, Min kaidmihi, MS. Berlin (W. Ahlwardt, Verzeichnis der arabischen Handschriften der Koninglichen Bibliothek zu Berlin, Berlin 1887- 1899, BD 4, S. 290, nu. 4876, Glaser 101), fol. 132a-132b. The text of the five principles was edited by E. Griffini in RSO 7 (1917), pp. 605 f, and also by M. 'Imara in Rasd'il al-'adl wa'l-tawhid, Cairo 1971, vol. I, p. 142. (Cf. Madelung, Der Imam, pp. 104-105). 3 See Madelung, Der Imam, p. 141. 4 See ibid., p. 104. Cf. ibid., p. 150.</page><page sequence="3">82 B. ABRAHAMOV [3] Kitdb tathbit al-imdma and Kitdb al-imama6, which deal with the necessity of an imam and his signs, Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-rdflda and Kitdb 6 In MS. Ambrosiana C186 (see E. Griffini, RSO 8 (1919-1920), pp. 293-297, no. 442 (C 186) the epistle is entitled al-'ihtidjddj fi'l-imdma. Parts of it were published in R. Strothmann's Das Staatsrecht der Zaiditen, Strassburg 1912, ch. 2. Madelung (Der Imam, pp. 99-100) doubts the authenticity of this work for some reasons: a. The language of the epistle is poor and sometimes incorrect. The difference between it and the likely authentic Kitdb tathbit al-'imdma, both of which treat the same subject, is very striking. b. The Zaydiyya's opponents, according to Kitdb al-imdma, namely al-Murdji'a, al-Kadariyya, the enemies of the Prophet's family, or Ali's enemies (al-Nawasib) and al-Khawaridj are not mentioned in al-Kasim's other epistles. The adversaries he always mentions are the Hashwiyya, who are missing here. Yet this list of adversaries exactly fits the list of enemies mentioned several times in the juridical work attributed to Zayd ibn 'All (See Madelung, Der Imam, p. 55). Possibly the expression Kadariyya still indicates the opponents of predestination. Madelung, then, concludes that the author was certainly a Zaydite of the old Kiific school. But it is evident that already at an early stage the work passed into al- Kasim's collection of epistles, since Ibn Nadim (Kitib al-f hrist, ed G. Flugel, Leipzig 1871, p. 193) and Abu Tilib al-Natik (Kitdb al-ifdda ft ta'rikh al-a'imma al-sdda, MS. Berlin, Glaser 37, fol. 25b) include it in al-Kasim's writings. Madelung's conclusion does not seem sufficiently well-founded. While the style is rather inferior, al-Kasim's style is not homogeneous, even in epistles Madelung considers to be genuine. His style in Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-zindik and Kitdb al-radd 'ala al-nasdrd - a forced and crude rhymed prose (sadj) - is different from the style in Kitdb al-dalil al-kabir, which is also written in rhymed prose, but is neither forced nor crude. And his style in the latter is different from that in Kitdb al-mustarshid (See my The Theological Epistles, vol. II, pp. 108-142. MS. Berlin, fols. 71b-81a), in which, as in other works, he does not write sometimes in rhymed prose. In his Kitdb al-masd'il (MS. Brit. Mu. Or. 3977) he does not use rhymed prose at all. Al-Kaisim seems to have initially written in rhymed prose, but in the course of time he gradually gave it up, so that his late epistles (e.g. Kitib al-dalil al- saghir) eschew this style. Contrary to Nyberg's doubts as to the authenticity of Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-zindik (See OLZ, 32(1929), pp.432 ff), Bergstrasser concludes that both this work and Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-nasdra were written by al-Kasim, but the latter was written somewhat later than the former (See Islamica 4 (1929-31), pp.295 ff. Madelung, Der Imam, p.90 f.) The style of Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-nasdrd is noticeably less crude than that of Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-zindik. Moreover, the key word ma'din (source, occurring in al-Kasim's Kitdb al-masd'il, fol. 57b. Cf. Madelung, Der Imam, p. 143), which refers to the Prophet's family as a source in which the imam can be found, appears several times in the same sense in Kitdb al-'imdma (See e.g. MS. Berlin, fol 57a, 1. 16, 57b, 11. 12-13). There is a possibility that one of al-Kasim's disciples wrote what he had heard from his master, and this might explain the mistakes occurring from time to time in the text. The Murdji'a are mentioned in al-Kasim's writings both by name and by their doctrines (See Kitib al-masd'il, fol. 47b. Kitdb al-dalil al-kabir in my The Theological Epistles vol; II, p. 41 (MS. Berlin, fol. 17a.) Kitdb al-'adl wa'l-tawhid, in Rasd'il al-'adl wa'l-tawhid, ed. M. 'Imara, Cairo 1971, pp. 121-122. The last epistle is considered by Madelung to be spurious). As to the Kadariyya, when in Kitdb al-'imdma the author includes them among his adversaries, he means the proponents of predestination, not its opponents. The former are explicitly mentioned in al-Kasim. In response to a question posed by his son Muhammad as to what is meant by the designation Kadariyya he says: &lt;the Kadariyya are those who uphold compulsion? (al-mudjbira. See Kitdb al-masd'il, fol. 47a). Also there is nothing surprising in including the enemies of the Prophet's family among the adversaries of one</page><page sequence="4">[4] AL-KASIM IBN IBRAHIM 83 al-radd 'ald al-rawafid min ashdb al-ghuluww7 which deal with the refutation of the Rafidite doctrines concerning the imamate. who holds that an imam should be of this family. As to the Khawaridj, they were of the opinion that an imam should be elected, (See El2, vol. IV, p. 1076), and this may be the reason why al-Kasim, who opposes this view, counts them as his adversaries. Madelung's conclusion that the author of Kitdb al-'imdma was a Zaydite of the early Kiific school is untenable. The Batriyya, who formed the doctrines of the early Zaydite school of Kiufa, held that an imam should be appointed by a council of electors (shurd), and some of them held that accession to the imamate was the privilege of every descendant of Ali who took to the sword in support of his claim (See Madelung, Der Imam, p. 50). But al- Kasim, who, in my opinion, is either the author of Kitdb al-'imdma or the author's first source, disagrees that an imam should be appointed by a council. In Kitdb al-'imdma al- Kasim asks: &lt;&lt;How God's messenger, may God bless him and give him peace, imposed (farada) the imama upon Abii Bakr, did he name him for you (sammdhu lakum bi- smihi wa- 'aynihi), or indicate him by his quality (dalia 'alayhi bi-sifatihi), or leave it to a council (tarakahd shzurd), or keep silent (sakata)?&gt;&gt; (See ibid. MS. Berlin, fol. 55a, 11. 4-6.) Al-Kasim rejects all these four ways of appointing an imam by the usual Kalam dialectical method of arguing (See ibid., fol. 55a-57a). Finally he draws the conclusion that Muhammad named his successor according to a message from God (Abu Bakr is mentioned by name), but after him the legitimate imam should be appointed on the basis of his relationship (kardba) to the Prophet, his being the most obedient, pious and wisest of people (See ibid., fol. 57a-fol. 58). The imamate, according to al-Kasim, is to be found in a known place (i.e. in a single specific person): 'inna al-'imdma ld takuinu 'illdf imawdi' ma'riif (See ibid., fol. 57a, 1. 12). Nowhere does al-Kasim indicate rebellion as a sign characteristic of the imam. It may be assumed that the author was a Djariidite. The Djaruidites did not approve of the imamate of Abii Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman, but declared that the Prophet had appointed'Ali - his legatee (wasi) - to be the legitimate imam. They represented the view that the community had made a mistake and transgressed God's precepts when it swore allegiance to the first three caliphs and not to 'All (See Madelung, Der Imam, pp. 44-46, al- Nashi', Kitdb 'uszul al-nihal, p.42, in J. van Ess, Fruhe Mu'tazilistische Hdresiographie, Beirut 1971). (About the authorship of Kitdb 'usul al-nihal, which is attributed by J. van Ess to al-Nashi' al-Akbar, see W. Madelung, &lt;&lt;Fruhe mu'tazilitische Haresiographie: das Kitab al-Usuil des Ga'far b. Harb?&gt;&gt; Der Islam, 57(1980), part 2, pp. 220-236). Whereas according to kitdb al-imdma it is evident that al-Kasim approved of the imamate of Abui Bakr and 'Umar, whom he mentions without rejecting them. The Djaruidites held that every descendant of al-Hasan and al-Husayn could be an imam by rising in rebellion (khurudj). See Madelung, Der Imam, p. 47. And as we have seen, al-Kasim was not of the opinion that rising in rebellion was a sign characteristic of the imam. We shall see below that notions expressed in Kitdb tathbit al-imama appear also in Kitab al-imdma. 7 Madelung also doubts the authenticity of this epistle. See Der Imam, pp. 98-99. He argues that the names of al-Kasim and four of his brothers appear in the epistle (See MS. Berlin, fol. 147) and that its style is different from that in Kitdb al-radd 'aid al-rdflda. But finally, since there is a connection between the two epistles with regard to the contents, Madelung draws the conclusion that Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-rawdfid was composed in accordance with al-Kasim's conception, by a disciple, probably one of his sons, who all figured in al-Kasim's life time as well versed in his writings. It is not clear why Madelung draws a different conclusion concerning Kitdb al-'imdma, although he has the same data as in Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-rawdfid, i.e., the works display a difference in style, but a similarity in contents, and biographers and bibliographers do not doubt the authenticity of either.</page><page sequence="5">84 B. ABRAHAMOV [5] II Most of the sects in Islam held that the obligation to appoint an imam was absolute. Only the Nadjdites, a sub-sect of the Kharidjites, Abii Bakr al-Asamm and Hisham al-Fuwati, opposed this principle, main- taining that if all the people are righteous and just, all of them are equal to one another, and there is therefore no reason to obey one of them8. The controversy has been over the proof that the appointment of an imam is obligatory - whether it is based upon reason (bi'l-'ak[) or upon tradition (bi'l-sam'), i.e. the Kur'an and the Sunna. The proof from reason for the appointment of an imam is expressed in the assertion that if a society did not have an imam, it would be destroyed, since every person would aspire to attain his goals without taking into consideration others' needs and feelings, and this would lead to robbery and killing9. Most of the Mu'tazilites held that the appointment of an imam was incumbent upon the community first according to reason and secondly according to tradition, whereas the 'Ashearites rated tradition in the first place and reason in the second 0. In this matter the Twelver Shl'ites The sole work of those attributed to al-Kasim, whose authenticity can be totally denied is Kitdb al-kdmil al-munir, a refutation of the Khawaridj. The Zaydite imams do not mention it, it does not occur in the MSS. in which all al-Kasim's works are included, its style is very different from al-Kasim's, and the answers to the Khawaridj suggest that the author is a Shl'ite Imami.

Al-Baghdadi, Kitdb 'usi7l al-din, Istanbul 1928, pp.271 f. According to the Mu'tazilite theologian al-Nashi' (See J. van Ess, Fruhe Mu'tazilitische, pp.49 f. arts. 82-83 of the Arabic text) the Mu'tazila were divided into two groups in regard to the obligation to appoint an imam. One maintained that this obligation was absolute, the other that the Muslims had the right to appoint an imam or not. Al-Asamm is not mentioned by al-Nashi' (See ibid) among those who denied the obligation to appoint an imam. According to al-Nashi' he asserts that in disorderly times, when one imam cannot rule, there may in fact be several imams. Thus al-'Ash'arl's report about al-Asamm would seem to be based on an implication rather than on a clear statement. Cf. W. M.

Al-Kasim based himself upon both reason and tradition. According to al-Kasim the obligation to appoint an imam is derived from the necessity of defending the community from its external enemies, the weak persons from the strong ones and the holy places. The imam is the one who watches people to induce and guide them to obey God's precepts. If there were no imam, people would be lost13. &lt;&lt;After the Prophet people cannot dispense with an imam. If they do, they will shed blood and violate prohibitions. The strong person will overwhelm the weak one and the rules and the punishments (al-ahkim wa'l-hudz7d) will be nullified"?&gt;&gt;. Al-Kasim states that the obligation to appoint an imam is connected with the wisdom (hikma) observed in Creation. God created the universe, since he wished (ardda) and chose (ikhtdra) to create it15. It is in- admissible to assume God, the Wise, creating things then wishing to destroy them; He created things in such a manner that they can exist. He created, for example, various kinds of food by which man can be nourished. Also the division of the year into seasons, months, days and nights for the benefit of man, and the animals that man can enslave, demonstrate that God created things for man's existence'6. The existence of human beings from infancy to maturity is dependent upon parents ('abd') who take care of their children and maintain them. The parents-sons chain reaches back to the first father, who was taught by God how to exist, i.e., to know the damage and the benefit in everything and to know how to punish the evil-doer and reward the '7 righteous person . Al-Kasim divides man's life into three periods (tabakdt). In the first period, the period of upbringing (tabakat al-tarbiya), people are depend- ent upon their parents. In the second period, the period of working to acquire food (tabakat 'i'timil al-'aghdhiya), they are independent of their parents. In the third period of doing good and evil ('iktisab'8 al-hasana See Ahmad Mahmuid Subhi, Nazariyyat al-'imdma ladd al-shi'a al-'ithna 'ashariyya, Cairo 1969, pp. 69-77.

Berlin fol. 83a f.). 18 The verbs kasaba and 'iktasaba are used in kalam prior to al-Ghazali in the sense of performing actions for which one is responsible. See M. Schwarz, ?Acquisition (kasb) in</page><page sequence="7">86 B. ABRAHAMOV [7] wa'l-sayyi'a), they need a guide and an instructor, who can punish them. In this period, the desire for sex and food is implanted in men, and if there were not someone to limit and curb it, people would fight against each other to satisfy their desires and consequently the world would be destroyed 9. God cstablished marriage to limit and curb the sexual desire and other known restrictions to limit people in their other activities. Whoever transgresses these restrictions is punished. People need a guide to teach them these restrictions, and this guide is the imam. Also, the imam punishes people if they disobey him, and rewards them if they obey him. In this manner people are kept safe20. Al-Kasim infers the obligation to appoint an imam also from two precepts, prayer and almsgiving. Since the prayer on Friday is directed by an imam, and the imam is mentioned in the Friday sermon21, there must be an imam to direct the prayer, and since the prayer is an obligation imposed upon Muslims, there is an obligation to appoint an imam. The precept of almsgiving too cannot be fulfilled without an imam who takes money from people and distributes it afterwards to the 22 poor The notion that an imam should be appointed since the precepts are fulfilled by people because of his presence and activities is generally expressed in Kitab al-'imama: &lt;&lt;Know that the most obligatory precept is the precept of the imamate (i.e., appointing an imam) (afrad al-fard'id wa-awkaduhd fard al-'imdma), since all precepts do not exist except through it (li-'anna djami' al-fara'id ld takuinu 'ilid bihd). It is forbidden to change this precept in any way (wa-ld yadjuizu tabdilfaridat al-'imdma), since its change (lit. since in it) entails (lit. there is) damage which is not entailed by the change of another precept (lit. which is not in another precept) (li-'anna fl/hd al-fasdd md laysa fi ghayrihd) 23 ,,.

Berlin 83b, f.). The distinction al-Kasim makes between the second and third periods is not justified, since according to al-Kasim himself work for acquiring food must also be limited (See ibid.). Thus, there is no difference between the second and third periods. 20 See ibid., pp. 211 f (MS. Berlin 83b, f.). 21 The mention of the imam in the Friday sermon is not explicitly stated by al-Kasim but implied in the following: wa-man kdnat tu'kadu lahu fa-mutakaddim kabla takad- dumihd. &lt;&lt;He for whom the prayer is established precedes the prayer)&gt;. ibid. p. 222 (MS. Berlin, fol. 87a). 22 See ibid. 23 See Kitib al-'imdma, MS. Berlin, fol. 56b, 11. 22-23. In Kitdb al-masd'il (fol. 58) Muhammad, al-Kasim's son, says that many of God's precepts can be fulfilled only through an imam. Cf. Madelung, Der Imam, p. 144.</page><page sequence="8">[8] AL-KASIM IBN IBRAHIM 87 The obligation to appoint an imam also evidently figures in the Kur'an. First al-Kasim shows that God chooses some of His creatures and prefers them to others. He refers, for example, to the following verse: ?He it is who has made you vice-gerents of the earth and has raised some of you above others in rank ... &gt;&gt; (siira 6, v. 165)24. Then he quotes verses (suira 2, v. 124, siira 32, vv. 23-24) stating that God appointed IbrThim an imam and also the other imams among the children of Israel. According to al-Kasim's interpretation of siura 3, v. 68 and siira 2, v. 129, Muhammad is the heir of IbrThim. &lt;&lt;'Verily, the people who are nearest to Ibrahim are those who followed him and this prophet and those who have believed. God is the defender of the believers'. (siira 3, v. 68). Muhammad, then, inherited the prophethood from IbrThim and Ismaeil, and the call of IbrThim and Isma'il came to him since they said: 'O, our Lord, raise up among them a messenger, one of themselves...' (siira 2, v. 129)&gt;&gt; 25. But ?the most obvious proof and the most illuminating revelation concerning the obligation of the imamate and (the fact) that it is obligatory on the community (wa-'abyan dalil. wa-'anwar tanzil.fi wudjuib al-'imdma. wa-md yadjibu minhd 'ald'l-'umma) is God's saying: 'O you who have believed, obey God and the messenger and the men of power ('ulu al-'amr) amongst you. If you quarrel about anything, refer it to God and the messenger, if you have come to believe in God and the Last Day, that is the best interpretation' (lit. that is better and fairer in interpretation). (sfira 4, v. 59). God, may He be blessed and exalted, ordered to obey the men of power with His ordering to obey Him and the messenger. God, may He be blessed and exalted, orders only a known thing (wa-ld ya'muru tabdraka wa-ta'dla 'illd bi-ma'lam ghayr madjhal)&gt;&gt;26. According to al-Kasim, the men of power are the imams. The last quoted verse appears as proof of the obligation of the imamate also in Kitdb al-imdma and after quoting it there al-Kasim adds, &lt;&lt;God ordered to obey that which is known (fa-'amara bi-td'at ma'luim ghayr mad]h)?&gt;&gt; 27. The only tradition figuring in al-Kasim as proof of the obligation of the imamate is: ?Whoever dies without having an imam, dies like an idolater (lit. dies an idolatrous death. man mdta ld imdm lahu mdta mita 24 See also siira 28, v. 68, suira 17, v. 21, suira 43, v. 32, siira 17, v. 70.

An allusion to this tradition figures in Kitdb al-'imdma where al-Kasim says that if there were no imam, the religion would again become idolatrous (lit. the religion would return to be idolatry. wa- radja'a al-din djfhiliyya)29. III After proving the necessity of the imamate and inferring its obligation from reason as well as from the Kur'an and the tradition, there is a need to know who is the imam. According to al-Kasim, the imam's identity must be evident and the signs attesting to him must be unequivocal, so that no unrightful pretender to the imamate can attribute it to himself. Only an undoubted imam can deter transgressors by inflicing punish- ment and bestowing reward to the obedient30. The imams31 are divided into three kinds: a. the messengers and the prophets (rusul, 'anbiyd') b. the legatees ('awsiyd')32 of the messengers and c. the successors of the prophets (khulafd' al-'anbiyd'), who are also called imams ('a'imma). The distinction between the messengers, the legatees and the imams is evident through the signs by which they can be identified. Al-Kasim recognizes the prophets, who are of the highest rank among the imams, through miracles ('ayayt) that have occurred to them. He mentions the miracles of Moses, Jesus and Muhammad3 3. The legatees are distinguished from the imams through three signs: a. God singled them out by naming them. b. The messengers knew their (special) rank, and c. The messengers distinguished them from others by 28 See Kitdb tathbit al-'imdma, p.206, 11. 8-9 (MS. Berlin, fol. 82a) Cf. Ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. IV, p. 96. The Twelver Shi'ites use this tradition to prove that the imamate is one of the principles of religion. See Subhi, Nazariyyat al-imdma, p. 64. Cf. Madelung, Der Imam, p. 95. 29 See Kitdb al-imdma, Ms. Berlin, fol. 57a, 11. 10-11. 30 See Kitdb tathbit al-'imama, p.213 (MS. Berlin, fol. 84b). 31 The word imam in al-Kasim has a double meaning: a. It is a general name for all kinds of people who guide and lead the community and b. It indicates one kind of leader whose identity is known through special signs. See below. 32 According to the Twelver Shi'ite doctrine wasi (pl. 'awsiyd') is a legatee of a prophet, i.e., the legitimate successor of a prophet as a leader of the community who transmits his legacy (wasiyya, which consists of esoteric knowledge and some concrete objects). Or he is a person who delivers a wasiyya of a prophet from a wasi to another or to a prophet. The Twelver Shi'ites posit the existence of an uninterrupted chain of prophets and legatees from Adam onward. 'All is Muhammad's wasi. According to some Twelver Shr-ite traditions'All is regarded as superior to all other legatees, and some traditions even make him equal in rank to the prophets. See U. Rubin, (&lt;Prophets and Progenitors in the Early Shl'a Tradition&gt;?, Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam, 1(1979), pp.41-51. 3 See Kitdb tathbit al-imama, pp.213 f. (MS. Berlin 84b).</page><page sequence="10">[10] AL-KASIM IBN IBRAHIM 89 statements of preference 34. 'All is brought by al-Kasim as an example of wasi. 'All's high rank is expressed in the following: He knew future events (this knowledge was transmitted to him by the Prophet); also he had a profound and wide knowledge of all sciences and of the various religions, and he knew the secrets of the Kur'an 3S; he was courageous in battle; he was among the first to believe in God; and he was eloquent36. The signs attesting to the imams are as follows: a. near relationship to the Prophet (kardba). b. perfection of wisdom (kamdl al-hikma) 37 and c. piety (takwd) 38* These signs of the imam are mentioned by al-Kasim also in Kitdb al-imdma (see above note 6) and Kitdb al-masd'il39. Al-Kasim infers the near relationship to the Prophet from Kur'an verses (e.g. siira 57, v. 26, siira 29, v. 27) which say that prophethood was given to the descendants of the prophets40. Apparently he did not find a Kur'an verse which could support his statement that an imam must have a near relationship to the prophets. Sometimes he even bases himself upon Kur'an verses which deal only with the family of a particular prophet and does not point out that prophethood passes to descen- dants4'. As proof that wisdom is a sign of an imam he cites the example of David42. Al-Kasim opposes the right of the community to choose ('ikhtiydr) an imam. Only the most excellent man (or the best man. fdl/ or afdal) is the legitimate imam. There is no imamate of one-who-is-known-to-be- excelled-by-others (maf.dul43.

Here al-Kasim mentions only two signs, whereas in other places (see below note 38) he adds a third sign, namely, piety (takwd). Possibly al-Kasim does not mention the third sign where he mentions the first two because the latter are in his opinion signs created by God, whereas asserting that piety is created by God would contradict al-Kasim's doctrine of free will. 38 See ibid., p. 205, 11. 11-14 (MS.

ABRAHAMOV [1 1] proof of 'All ibn AbI Talib's imamate, al-Kasim says: &lt;&lt;It is incumbent upon people to obey 'Ali (ta'at Ali) and give him priority (over others) (takdimuhu), because of his excellence in the religion of God (li-fadl 41 ift din allah) ... Whoever gives another priority over him (man kaddama ghayrahu 'alayhi), gives the one who is known to be excelled by others (mafduii) priority over the most excellent man (af4da1)... ))'I Al-Hadi cites his grandfather, al-Kasim ibn lbrahim, as proof of the assertion that the imamate is valid without the consent (rida) of the community and the prior oath of allegiance (bay'a) of two or more Muslims45. Rational reasons listed by al-Kasim point at his preference for seeking the imam according to the latter's wisdom and relationship to the Prophet and oppose the view that the imam is to be chosen by the people. Seeking the imam according to his relationship to the Prophet is easier in a period in which tyranny rules; if the imam were known by name, he would be subject to injury by the tyrant46. Finding the imam according to the choice and opinion of people lengthens the period of seeking him. Consequently this causes many laws for whose fulfillment the imam is responsible to be nullified, and hence people are neglected and harmed. God wants to make things easy for people rather than difficult, and has therefore shown them a way by which they can easily find the imam47. Al-Kasim proffers two more arguments against the principle of the community's choosing the imam. The first argument is based upon the Kur'an; It is God who chooses the imam not people. God does not enable people to choose things bestowed upon them by Him; they certainly do not have the choice concerning the greatest religious matter48. be mafdzil. See'Abdallah ibn Muhammad al-Nashi', Kitdb 'usull al-nihal, in J. van Ess, Fruhe Mu'tazilitische, pp. 50-61 of the Arabic text. 44 See MS. Berlin, fol. 13 lb. The imamate belongs to the best man among the people on earth (khayr ahl al-'ard), whose excellence (fadluhu), abstinence (zuhduhu) and knowledge ('ilmuhu) become evident to people. See Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-rawdfld. MS. Berlin, fol. 106b, 11. 5, 19-21. Cf. S. Pines, &lt; Shi'ite Terms and Conceptions in Judah Halevi's Kuzari&gt;&gt;, Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam 2(1980), pp. 169-170. In response to the question of the possibility of the existence of two imams in one generation, al-Kasim, pointing at siura 12, v.76, says that there is always one who surpasses others in his knowledge. See Kitdb al-masd'il, fol. 57b. 4S See Madelung, Der Imam, p. 142, n. 248. 46 See Kitdb tathbit al-'imama, p. 219 (MS. Berlin, fol. 86a). Is it not possible that the man most closely related to the Prophet's family should also be known by name? Al-Kasim seems to undermine his own reason. 47 See ibid., p. 219 f. (MS. Berlin fol. 86a.f.). 48 See ibid., pp. 204, 220 (MS. Berlin, fols. 8 lb., 86b).</page><page sequence="12">[12] AL-KASIM IBN IBRAHIM 91 The second argument is expressed through the method of arguing called 'ilzdm49. The question is who chooses the imam, the common people (al-'awamm) or the elite (al-khawass)? If the word 'awdmm means the community in its entirety, then the choosing is unachievable, since members of the community are scattered all over the world and their number is not fixed, because of births and deaths. And it is inadmissible that God should impose on man a task beyond his ability 50. If the choice is in the hands of the elite, then one must ask who are the elite and how one can recognize them? If they are recognized through their knowledge and excellence, who will assert that concerning them? If the common people are entitled to assert that concerning them, they will be more entitled to know who the imam is, since he surpasses the excellent people among them. Thereafter al-Kasim continues the course of 'ilzdm to prove that there is no possibility of establishing any group of persons who should choose the imam, and consequently there is no possibility of choosing him 5 1. In Kitdb al-'imdma, too, al-Kasim opposes the principle of choosing the imam, arguing as follows: On the one hand &lt;&lt;If the 'imdma springs from the most exalted and nearest place to the messenger ('idha kharadjat min 'arfa' al-mawddi' wa-akrabihd 'ild al-rasul), every sect (firka) of the community will claim the imamate and a controversy ('ikhtild]) will take place, and a controversy means abrogation of religion ('ibtdl al-din)&gt;&gt; 52. On the other hand, if the imamate is not established according to the relationship to the Prophet but according to different sources (ma'adin mukhtalifa), then there will be a need for shurd (council of electors). Now the members of the shura must come from different and distant places. Their aims will be different, even though it is possible to gather them, I9 Ilzdm means literally (&lt;to force?). It is a common kalam method of arguing by which one &lt;draws)) from his adversary's opinions conclusions (&lt;forces)) his adversary to conclude) which either contradict the latter doctrine or lead to absurdity or unbelief.

E. von Grunebaum, Wiesbaden 1970, pp.25 f. so Here al-Kasim uses the Mu'tazilite notion of taklifmd lI yutdku,. which constitutes a part of the Mu'tazilite principle of God's justice ('adl). According to this notion, it is inconceivable that God should order man to do what he is incapable of doing. God would have to be considered unjust if He punished man for doing what he cannot avoid doing, or for not doing what he is unable to do. See R. Brunschvig, ((Devoir et pouvoir.

ABRAHAMOV [13] since every group of the council will claim the imamate. Their contro- versy will bring about war, and war will lead to perdition. Since God wants to bring benefit to his servants ('islah 'ibddihi) 53, it is inadmissible that He should order them to maintain a precept in such a manner that would cause their perdition . It is impossible to assert that al-Kasim belonged to either the Djariidite or the Batrite wing of the Zaydiyya. Madelung asserts that &lt;&lt;in his theory of the imamate al-Kasim clearly rejects the point of view of the Batriyya. 'All was from the beginning the only legitimate successor of the Prophet as the Djariidites taught?) 55. But nowhere in his writings does al- Kasim explicitly say that the Prophet appointed'All to be his successor. Answering the question of whether 'All was appointed by the Prophet to be an imam by a testament (wasiyya) which said ?you are the imam after me?), al-Kasim says diffidently: ?It was a sufficient and defined allusion? 56. The passage asserting that 'All must be given priority over others (See above p. 89) does not prove that al-Kasim illegitimizes the imamate of Abii Bakr and 'Umar, but it comes to assert that 'All was the most excellent among the first caliphs57. The notion that'All is the most excellent, but that Abii Bakr and 'Umar are nevertheless legitimate caliphs is a Batrite notion according to the report of the Mu'tazilite heresiographer al-Nashi': &lt;&lt;'All ibn Abi Talib was the most excellent person ('afdal al-nas) after the messenger of God, may God bless him and give him peace, and the best-suited person for the imamate (wa-awlthum bi'l-'imama). They (the Batrites) claimed that the oath of allegiance (bay'a) that was given to Abui Bakr and 'Umar, may God be pleased with both of them, was not a fault (khata), since 'All gave both of them an oath of allegiance, and approved of their imamate... ,, 58. This notion was also accepted by the Mu'tazilites of Baghdad who are described by some S According to the general doctrine of the Mu'tazila God performs no evil act, but does the best possible (aslah) for people.

See al- Nashi', Kitdb 'usul al-nihal, p. 42, art. 66 in J. van Ess, Fruhe Mu'tazilitische. 57 Al-Kaisim also asserts that loyalty to 'Ali (waldya or muwdlat) is among the most important precepts incumbent upon every Muslim.

Also Sulayman ibn Djarir, an early Zaydite theologian about whom little is known, regarded the appoint- ment of Abui Bakr as a fault (khata'), but not as a sin (fisk), since the imamate of the maf.dul is valid if he is wise and has good qualities60. Like al-Kasim, Sulayman ibn Djarir holds that the Prophet alluded to the imamate of 'All, but did not designate him explicitly to be an imam (wa- 'ashara 'ilayhd 'ald ghayr sabil al-nass)61. When al-Kasim takes a stand against the caliph 'Umar, it is not a stand on the political question of the imamate62. According to Made- lung he criticizes 'Umar's knowledge, not his having been a ruler63. And Madelung adds: ?Basically al-Kasim's polemics is less directed to the second caliph than to the tradition of the school which is connected with him ('Umar) and his son 'Abdallah. Against the proponents of this school al-Kasim exalts Ibn al-'Abbas who accepted a tradition of another school in al-Madina which 'Umar and his son appreciated only slightly?64. We have seen (n. 6 above) that al-Kasim does not illegitimize the imamate of Abii Bakr and 'Umar, so that in this matter he agrees with the Batrites. But his view concerning the signs attesting to the legitimate imam differs from those of both the Djariidites and the Batrites: He does not consider taking to the sword a sign of the imam, and he holds that the imam must not be chosen by the community. In addition to the relationship to the Prophet, a sign attesting to the legitimate imam accepted by both the Djaruidites and the Batrites, al-Kasim regards knowledge and wisdom as a sign. This sign figures in the later Zaydite doctrine of the imamate from the time of al-Kasim's grandson, al-Hadi (d. 911), alongside taking to the sword65. Finally, al-Kasim does not point out a clear way to identify the imam. He does not assert exactly what he means by near relationship to the Prophet, and his vague assertion can result in controversy, of which he warns his adversaries, who favor the choosing of the imam. Also he does not answer the question of how a large group of people can agree on one person. Furthermore, what makes the finding of the imam more difficult is al-Kasim's assertion that the imam must not declare, &lt;I am the sg See Madelung, ibid., p.42 f. 60 See ibid., p. 63.

ABRAHAMOV [15] imam&gt;&gt;66. Indeed, in Kitdb al-'imama67 al-Kasim says that whoever proves that he is the wisest man, is the imam, but here too the approval of his imamate should come from the community. Al-Kasim seems to hold that the imam's personality is so superior to the other's, that there will be no dispute concerning his identity. Al-Kasim did not openly claim the imamate for himself, though he possibly considered himself suitable for it, and he alludes to that suitability from time to time. If he considered himself suitable for the imamate, he did not act according to the Zaydite doctrine asserting that the real imam of the Prophet's family cannot be one who willingly leaves the rule over the Muslims in the hands of those who usurped it68. The later Zaydites maintained that al-Kasim took to the sword and was even an imam, but all this seems to be rewriting of history, for Zaydite purposes. However, as a result of the Zaydite contention, al-Kasim's doctrine preserved authority which other Zaydite scholars could not oppose. Throughout al-Kasim's writings there is no propaganda for rebellion and there are not even external and reliable pieces of evidence proving that he rebelled or was recognized as an imam69. IV Al-Kasim sharply polemicizes against the Rafida70, attacking their 66 See ibid., p. 143. Kitdb al-masd'il, fol. 60b. 67 See fol. 58a. 68 See Madelung, Der Imam, p. 145. 69 See ibid., pp. 91-96. 70 The word Rafida derives from the verb rafada which means &lt;to desert&gt;&gt;, and hence can be rendered odeserters&gt;&gt;. This is an abusive term used by the Zaydites for those who deserted Zayd ibn 'Ali, the Shl'ite rebel, and refused to help him. See Ibn Taymiyya, Minhidj al-sunna al-nabawiyyafi nakd kaldm al-shi'a al-kadariyya, ed. Muhammad Rashad Salim, Beirut n.d., vol. 1, p. 21. According to Ibn Taymiyya, since Zayd ibn'All's rebellion, the Shl'a have been divided into Rafida and Zaydiyya, so that the term Rafida has become known only from 120 or 122 H. Cf. I. Friedlaender, ((The Heterodoxies of the Shiites&gt;&gt;, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 29(1909), pp. 138-141. Watt argues that it is inconceivable that the first meaning of the term Rafida applies, since one of the few cases in which the epithet Imamiyya (applied to Shl'ites who believed in the twelve imams) figures in Makdldt is when al-'Ash'ari quotes from a Zaydite source (p. 64, 1. 5), and al-Khayyat speaks in Kitdb al-'intisdr (Nyberg's ed. with A. N. Nader's tran. into French, Beirut 1957, p. 14, 1. 7f., p. 15, 1. 13 of the Arabic text) of the Rafida whereas the work he criticizes deals with the Shi'a. Accordingly, al-'Ash'arl seems to be right in stating (see op. cit., p. 16, 11. 11-17) that those who deserted Abui Bakr and 'Umar were called Rafida, i.e., those who held that Abui Bakr and Umar were usurpers elected to, the caliphate, through a mistake of the Companions (sahaba).

Possibly the combination of the two meanings of this term, as Friedlaender proposed, helps answer the question of who the Rafidites were. According to Friedlaender what characterized the Rafidites, those who deserted Zayd ibn Ali and whom Zayd called the &lt;deserters?), was their negative attitude towards Abui Bakr and 'Umar and to a lesser extent towards 'Uthman and other Companions. See op. cit., p. 142 and mainly note 6. Rafida was sometimes used to indicate extreme Shi'ites, in contrast to the Shi'a which was used to indicate the moderate Shi'ites. See Friedlaender, op. cit., pp. 146-148. But since the crystallization of the Imamite Shi'ite doctrine, the Zaydites and frequently the Sunnites described the Shi'a Imamiyya as Rafida. See ibid., pp. 148-150. This is further supported by the report of al-Malati (d. 377/987). Indeed, al-Malati applies the terms Imamiyya and Rafida to all the sects of the Shi'a, both extreme and moderate - the Zaydites and the Isma'ilites are also called Imamiyya (see Kitab al-tanbih wa'l-radd 'ald 'ahl al-ahwd' wa'l- bida', ed. Muhammad Zahid al-Kawtharl, Baghdad and Beirut 1968, pp. 18-35, and cf. Friedlaender op. cit., pp. 154-159) - but Rafida with its special meaning according to al- Malati is mentioned only with regard to the Hishamiyya, the adherents of Hisham ibn al- Hakam. ?The twelfth group of the Imamiyya are the followers of Hisham ibn al-Hakam and are known by the name Hishamiyya. Those are the Rafida about whom it was related by God's messenger, may God bless him and give him peace, that they deserted the religion (yarfuduin al-din)&gt;&gt;. See ibid., p. 24. This meaning of rafada seems to reflect al-Malati's hostility to the Shi'a, which already in his time had clear and definitive doctrines. For Rafida as an honorific see E. Kohlberg, JAOS 99 (1979), pp. 677-679. Al-Kaisim deals with the refutation of the Rafida in the two epistles: 1. Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-rdfida and 2. Kitdb al-radd 'aid al-rawdfid. In the first epistle he does not mention the application of the appellation Rafida, but criticizes the doctrines of both Hisham ibn al- Hakam and Hisham ibn Salim (see the Theological Epistles, pp. 313-314. MS. Berlin, fol. 1 12a), whom he mentions by name. They were later recognized by the heresiographers as the first exponents of the Imamiyya. In the second epistle he applies Rafida as an abusive term to all the Shi'ite sects except the Zaydites. 'iftaraka man 'idda'ai al-tashayyu' 'ala thaldthata 'ashara sinfan minhum 'ithnd 'ashara fl'l-ndr wa-hum al-rawdfid. ?Those who claimed to be Shi'ites were split into thirteen sects of which twelve are in Hell, and those are the rawdfid.?&gt; See MS. Berlin, fol. 104a, 11. 1-2. Pines is of the opinion that in the enumeration of the various sects of the Rawafid given after the sentence quoted above al- Kasim seems to apply the name to the Shlrite groups, from the fourth group on, which recognized the imamate of Dj'far al-Sdik and his successors. Thus the comprehensiveness of the first application is restricted. According to Pines this application is based upon the fact that after mentioning those who consider that the wasiyya was transmitted to Dja'far ibn Muhammad and believe it finally came to him (the fourth group), it is said: ?They (the latter) are the Raw5fid?&gt;. The names of the sects which disputed Dja'far's succession come afterwards. See S. Pines, ?Shi'ite terms?), pp. 167-168. But Pines himself admits the difficulty of attributing to al-Kasim the restriction of the appellation, since according to the second meaning of Rafida the first three groups should not be designated Rafida. See ibid., n. 19. It is inconceivable that a writer like al-Kasim should confuse two different definitions of Rafida in one place. Thus al-Kasim appears to hold that the term Rafida is applied to those who claimed to be Shl'ites, and those who recognized the imamate of Dja'far and his successors are included in this broad definition. This explanation is further supported, by the fact that those who recognized the imamate of Dja'far appear as the fourth of the twelve groups, and a group that is listed under one category cannot probably figure in another. 71 See n. 32 above. Here wasiyya means appointment as the legitimate successor to the imamate. Cf. S. Pines, ? Shi'ite Terms?), p. 168, n. 24.</page><page sequence="17">96 B. ABRAHAMOV [17] a. The Rafidites maintain that there has been no period without a legatee (wasi. See n. 32 above) who has received the legacy from a prophet or from another legatee. According to them, a legatee is proof of God (hudjdjat Allah) which obliges people to believe in Him. A legatee knows all the precepts of God and hence people must obey him. Only he who knows a wasi, whom no one in his time equals in qualities, can find the way to God74. Al-Kasim refutes the Rafidite doctrine of the wasiyya on the basis of intervals of time (fatarat)75 separating two prophets or two successive messengers, during which the nations are not guided. If in these intervals of time there had been imams or legatees who knew all the precepts and prohibitions, there would have been no need to send prophets after Adam, since the imams would have guided the nations. The fact that God has sent prophets and messengers to the nations proves that there is no uninterrupted chain of legatees, or that whoever believes in this uninterrupted chain, disbelieves God's book that speaks of prophets and messengers that God has sent to the nations 76. Al-Kasim ascribes the notion that no prophet or messenger was sent to mankind after Adam to the barhamiyya, a heretic Indian sect. They maintain that Adam bequeathed ('awsd) his prophethood to Shith, and Shith bequeathed it to a legatee of his sons, and then they trace the legacy by a chain of legatees 72 Tashbih means the likening of God to something of creation in general and specifically the likening of God to man (anthropomorphism), that is, attributing to God man's condition, form and actions. The view opposing tashbih maintains that God is not like anything in creation, and hence He is not like man.

The Imamite Shi'ite must be careful to hide his identity; He must dissemble his real belief, and in a place where his opponents rule he must also behave like them, in order to avert the danger of persecution of his coreligionists. See I. Goldziher, Vorlesungen uber den Islam, Heidelberg 1910, pp. 214-215. E. Kohlberg convincingly proves that by the side of Imimite Shi'ites who regarded takiyya as a principle of religion, there were also some Imimite Shi'ites who accepted takiyya with some reservations, as well as some others who did not act according to takiyya and preferred to fight for their belief.

This claim is that the wasiyya of David (D'iid) was bequeathed to the Resh gelhtha. See S.

See MSS.] They are Indian (hum min al-Hind), who are called al-Ibrdhimiyya and they are the lords of (that) country. They believe (za'amu7) that Adam bequeathed ('awsd) the wasiyya to Shith, and Shith (in his turn) to his son. In this way they trace the wasiyya to themselves. [&lt;&lt;They believe that the wasiyya is in them today?&gt;.

ABRAHAMOV [19] Barahima's view contradicts completely the teaching of the Kur'an which shows that God sent messengers to mislead people in order to The notion that Adam is the sole authority concerning religious matters is also found in Sa'adia's Kitdb al-'amdndt wa'l-'i'tikdddt (See ed. S. Landauer, Leiden 1880, p. 139, ed. J. Kafah, Jerusalem 1970, p. 143 tran. by S. Pines, &lt;&lt;Shi'ite Terms,&gt; p. 221). The name used by Saadia is bardhima which is close to al-Kasim's usage in Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-rdflda, namely al-barhamiyya. The Arabic theological and polemical literature contains a tradition concerning the Barahima that is different from the one mentioned above. Ibn al-Rawandi the famous free thinker (according to P. Kraus, &lt;&lt;Beitrage zur Islamischen Ketzer- geschichte,&gt;&gt; RSO 14(1934), p. 375, he died around 300/912, whereas H. Nyberg gives an earlier date, 250/864. See al-Khayat, Kitdb al-'intisdr, pp. XXX-XXXIV) - in his Kitdb al- zumurrud - put into the mouth of the Barahima the denial, in the name of reason, of the authority of all the prophets. Ibn al-Rawandi uses the Barahima undoubtedly as a disguise, since it would have been too hazardous to express such an opinion in his own name. Later authors cite this opinion as Barahimite, and Kraus states that their source is Ibn al- Rawandi. See Kraus, ibid., pp. 123-129, 341-358. Kraus is quite right concerning the authors he mentions except for Saadia who brings, as has been said, another opinion of the Barahima. Kraus recognizes the difficulty in considering Ibn al-Rawandi the direct source of the Barahima's opinion as reported in Saadia, and seems to suppose that Saadia cites the Barahima's opinion as elaborated by later authors. Cf. Pines, &lt;&lt;Shi'ite Terms,&gt;&gt; p. 220. Pines has a different hypothesis. First he says that the Ibrahimiyya figuring in al-Kasim are none other than al-Barahima. This is also proven by the fact (not mentioned by Pines) that al- Kasim's Kitdb al-radd 'ala rdfida, in which the appellation al-barhamiyya appears, expresses the same notion concerning the prophethood of Adam and Shith that figures in Kitdb al- radd 'aid al-rawdfid.) Al-Kasim's source of the Barahima's opinion cannot possibly be Ibn al-Rdwand1. The contrary seems to be more reasonable. &lt;&lt;Al-KUsim's and Sa'adia's Barahima (or Ibrihimiyya) apparently considered that Adam, the first man and the first prophet, had promulgated a Law, whose authority was not and would not be superseded by any subsequent legislation. If we turn to India, we find that, according to the religious tradition, Manu the First Man is the author of a code of law, the Manusmriti, which is supposed still to be in force. The similarity between this doctrine and that of al-Kasim's and Sa'adia's Barahima (or IbrThimiyya) is unmistakable. There is thus some reason to suppose that the accounts given of the latter were in the last analysis based on a correct piece of information concerning Indian beliefs. Given this fact, there is a possibility - it is no more than that - that it is because Ibn al-Rawandi had knowledge of accounts of the Barahima referred to by al-Kasim and Sa'adia, and was thus aware that they considered that mankind, throughout its history, has and will have only one valid and unchanging code of law, that he decided to use the name of this Indian group in order to express his own views concerning the function of reason, by whose commands - and not those of Islam - man should be ruled.&gt;&gt; See Pines, ibid., p.222-223. In the course of the exposition of his hypothesis Pines states that no connection is suggested between the appellation Ibrahimiyya and Ibr&amp;him (Abraham). Yet al-BakillTni's report of the Barahima, which is not mentioned by Pines, suggests such a connection. &lt;The Barahima were split according to two opinions. Some of them denied the messengers (djahadui al-rusut) and maintained (za'amd) that it is inconceivable (la yadjdzu) on the basis of the Creator's wisdom and quality (ft hikmat al-bari wa-sifatihz) that He should send a messenger to His creatures, and that there is no way by which the acceptance of the mission (by a messenger) from the Creator is possible. The other group said: 'God did not send a messenger to His creatures except Adam.' And they accused every impostor (mudda'in) to prophethood except him of lying (kadhdhabui). Some of this group said: No, God did not send (anyone) except Ibrahim alone.' They denied the prophethood of anyone except him&gt;&gt;. See Kitdb al-tamihd, ed. R. J. McCarthy, Beirut, 1957, p. 104, art. 184. Thus is it possible to</page><page sequence="20">[20] AL-KASIM IBN IBRAHTM 99 warn and guide them. The Kur'an does not mention the Rafidite notion of wasiyya. Also it points out that all people have been misled, whereas the Rafidites maintain that there have been legatees among them, i.e., those who are not misled and whose way is the right one78. Another argument against the doctrine of the wasiyya refers to Muhammad's prophethood. If Muhammad accepted a legacy from a wasi, who was this wasi? He could not possibly have been an Arab, since every Arab was then 'ummi79, and he could likewise not possibly have been non-Arab, since the Kur'an informs us that the master of the Prophet was not a person of the nations and that God taught him in clear Arabic 80. From the Rafidite statements one can infer that the Prophet accepted a legacy and accordingly was necessarily guided to the right way, whereas the Kur'an teaches us that Muhammad at first went astray, then God guided him, contrary to the Rafidite view claiming that some of their imams knew the right way while still children81. suppose that the original name of the sect was Ibrihimiyya which was afterwards garbled and changed into Barahima? Or, on the contrary, one can suppose that the combination of the two traditions concerning the Barahima made by such a later source as al-Bakillani (d. 1013) is due to his drawing on both Ibn al-Riwandi's writings and those of Sa'adia and al-Kasim. (The name Ibrahim might have been taken from Ibrahimiyya). Pines' supposi- tion that Ibn al-Rawandi decided to use the name Barahima to express his own views concerning the superiority of reason because the latter believed in one valid and unchanging code of law ruling mankind seems to be questionable. Taking for granted that Ibn al- Rawandi used the Barahima as a disguise and that the Barahima were known in the middle of the ninth century (through al-Kasim or others) as believing in Adam's prophethood alone, it does not seem conceivable that Ibn al-Rawandi should have used the name Barahima, since this usage would have disclosed that he expressed his own views not those of the Barahima. One can falsely refer a view to others only when the latter's views are not known. It seems more plausible that Ibn al-Riwandi had a different knowledge of the Barahima than that of al-Kasim and Sa'adia. In an article entitled &lt;&lt;Ibn ar-Rewandi, or the Making of an Image&gt; (Al-Abhath 27(1978- 79), pp. 5-26) J. van Ess tries to prove that Ibn al-Rawandi knew heretical views but did not identify himself with them. According to van Ess, Ibn al-Rawandi's views concerning prophethood and messengers published in Kraus' article (see above) are not his views, but views of his opponents mentioned by Ibn al-Rawandi with the purpose of refuting them. See ibid., p. 15. Van Ess does not deal with the question of the source of the Barahima's views in his article. 78 See Kitdb al-radd ald al-rdfida, pp. 3 11-312, 315-317 (MS.

In Kitdb al-radd 'aid al-rawdfld al- Kasim explains that Muhammad's going astray was not because he attributed a copartner to God (shirk) and not like the going astray of Kuraysh, the Jews and the Christians: Muhammad went astray, since he did not know the precepts. See MS. Berlin, fol. 104b, 11. 8-10.</page><page sequence="21">100 B. ABRAHAMOV [21] In Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-rdfida al-Kasim sharply criticizes the Rafidites who appointed children to be imams. Muslims are forbidden to appoint a child to be an imam, because according to the Sunna it is prohibited to follow a child in prayer, to eat from his slaughtering, to accept his testimony, to engage with him in buying and selling, to marry him, and it is impossible to trust him with regard to his property. A person who cannot be trusted with regard to these matters, cannot be trusted with regard to religious matters82. It is inadmissible that a child should serve as God's decisive proof (Iudjdja bdligha according to siura 6, v. 149), and indeed God sent Muhammad only when he was an adult83. Muhammad says that he is the first Muslim (wa-'ana 'awwal al- muslimin. siura 6, v. 163), whereas the Rafidites maintain that Muham- mad was preceded by a wasi, hence the wasi's belief and certain knowledge (yakin) preceded Muhammad's belief and certain knowledge, and this totally contradicts the teaching of the Kur'an. The same applies to their notion concerning Abraham. Al-Kasim draws from the Rafidite view the absurd conclusion that the Rafidites know the legatees that Abraham and Muhammad did not know. If this is inconceivable with respect to Abraham and Muhammad, it is also inconceivable with respect to many messengers of God 84. So by using the method of 'ilzdm (see above n. 49) al-Kasim refutes the Rafidite doctrine of the wasiyya. He also argues that the Rafidite doctrine that the imamate is hereditary is in contradiction to the fact that the imam al-Hasan ibn 'All was succeeded not by his son but by his brother al-Husayn85. Madelung asserts that al-Kasim's refutation of the wasiyya doctrine contradicts his proof of the obligation to appoint an imam. &lt;&lt;Certainly al-Kasim undermines thereby his own proof of the imamate. He himself based the necessity of the imamate upon the statement that the Creator in His wisdom cannot leave the people without a teacher who is provided with the knowledge of God's precepts. Here the incompleteness of al- Kasim's theory of the imamate appears&gt;&gt;86. Madelung's assertion is questionable, for so far as I know nowhere in his writings does al-Kasim express the notion that &lt;&lt;the Creator in His wisdom cannot leave the people without a teacher who is provided with the knowledged of God's precepts&gt;&gt;, but he explicitly states that society is built in such a way that 82 See ibid., fol. 105b, 11. 19-26. 83 See ibid., fol. 108b, 11. 12-17. 84 See Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-rdflda, pp. 320-321 (MS. Berlin, fols. 1I13b-1 14a). 8S See Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-rawdfid, MS. Berlin, fols. 105a ff. 86 Madelung, Der Imam, p. 146.</page><page sequence="22">[22] AL-KASIM IBN IBRAHIM 101 there is a need for an instructor whom people can identify according to special signs. As has been said, al-Kasim divides the imams into three types, prophets, legatees and imams. There have been intervals of time in which society has existed without the right guidance for people by instructors (prophets, legatees or imams). Speaking of these intervals of time, al-Kasim does not deny the existence of leaders who have protected their society from total destruction. Al-Kasim's emphasis is on the type of instructor that knows God's precepts. Thus, after God gave the precepts in the Kur'ran, people were obliged to find an imam who would guide them to fulfill the precepts. Al-Kasim's statement with regard to the obligation to appoint an imam refers, then, to the time after Muhammad. At that time there was always someone whom people could identify according to his signs. Al-Kasim also argues against the principle of a hereditary imamate from father to son as held by the Rdfidites87. This principle is contrary to the signs he establishes for the prophet and imam, namely perfection of wisdom and piety. ?Had the imamate and prophethood been transmitted by inheritance (wirdtha), they both would not have left Yemen for other countries, since Huid was a prophet who would have transmitted the prophethood (lit. the thing al- 'amr) to his descendants, and the prophethood (al-'amr) would not have left him to others? 88. It may be assumed that since in Kitab al-radd 'alaI al-rawdfid al-Kasim refers to the imamate generally, not specifically to the imamate after Muhammad, he does not mention the sign of relationship to Muhammad. b. Al-Kasim blames the Rafida for holding tashbih. The adherents of Hisham ibn Salim al-Djawdliki89 likened God to man's image, (sz7ra) i.e., God is in man's image, but He is not flesh and blood, namely He is not a body90. Hisham ibn al-Hakam9l held that God is light (ntir)92, and He 87 See Kitdb al-radd 'aid al-rawdfld, MS. Berlin, fol. 105a, 1.27 f. 88 See ibid., fol. 106b, 11. 6-8. 89 A Shi'ite Mutakallim contemporary of Hisham ibn al-Hakam (see below). 90 See Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-rafida, p. 313 (MS.

On the other hand some theologians contend that God is a body, but deny that He is in man's image.

The likeners generally based their view upon the verse: oGod is the light of the heavens and earth&gt; (suira</page><page sequence="23">102 B. ABRAHAMOV [23] is a hexagonal body, (djuththa musaddasat al-mikddr)93, and He knows by movements (ya'lamu bi'l-harakdt) 94, and He is in a place (tahuffu bihi al-amdkin), and He moves from one place to another (yatanakkalu)95, and He changes His dicisions (tabda lahu al-badawdt)96 and that the heavens are empty of Him (takhl minhu al-samdwdt), since He is on the throne ('ald al-'arsh) and not in another place97. The Rafidites are also accused of holding the opinion that God knows a thing only when He is near to it, since He sees a thing only when there is no screen between Him and the thing (wa-'annahu ld yubsiru md hadjabathu 'anhu al-hudjub wa-ld yardhu)98. Al-Kasim refutes this opinion by quoting some Kur'anic verses (sira 58, v. 6, suira 22, v. 17, suira 50, v. 16, siira 6, v. 3) in which God's absolute knowledge is explicitly proved. Two other verses (siura 42, v. 1 1, suira 12, v. 4) demonstrate that God is unlike anything else. If God were light or a body, there would be others like him, since He would be equal to others in corporeality (djismiyya) and the quality of light (nariyya). Furthermore, if He were light, darkness (zulma) would be his opposite (didd). But God is far from being equal to something or having 24, v. 35). Al-Kasim devotes a chapter in his Kitdb al-mustarshid to a refutation of those who maintain that God is light (al-radd 'ald man za'ama 'anna Allah nur ka'l-anwdr al- makhluka). See The Theological Epistles, pp. 113-117 (MS. Berlin, fols. 73a-74a). Al- Kasim's main argument is that light is created, therefore God, the Creator, cannot be light. 9 Cf. al-'Ash'ari, Makdldt, p. 31, 11. 11-12. 9 This is the opinion of Hisham ibn al-Hakam and Abui Dja'far al-Ahwal (called Shaytan al-Taik by opponents), a Shit ite Mutakallim contemporary of Hisham ibn al- Hakam, on divine knowledge. According to Abui Dja'far al-Ahwal God knows a thing only if He wills it; if He does not will a thing, He does not know it. &lt;&lt;He wills a thing&gt;&gt; means that He moves and this movement is His will. Thus if He moves, He knows. See al-'Ash'ari, Makdldt, p. 220, 11. 1-4.

Those who maintained that God's place is the throne support their view with verses stating that God sits upon the throne or mounts the throne ('istawd 'ald al-'arsh.

Al-Kasim devotes an entire epistle (Sifat al-'arsh wa'l-kursi wa-tafsiruhuma, The Theological Epistles pp. 240- 263, MS. Berlin, fols. 94b-100b) to the discussion of these verses. Following the Mu'tazila he interprets them metaphorically e.g. 'istawd is interpreted to mean ?dominate&gt;&gt;. 98 The question is whether God sees and knows things that are hidden from Him by other things. According to Hisham ibn al-Hakam, God neither sees nor knows a thing hidden behind another thing, unless He sends a continuous ray of light which touches the hidden things. See al-'Ash'arli, Makdldt, p. 33, 11. 14, p. 221, 11. 11-14. Al-Baghdidi, al-Fark, p.66, 1. 6-p. 67, 1. 1.</page><page sequence="24">[24] AL-KASIM IBN IBRAHIM 103 an opposite. Hence, whoever holds tashbih, attributes a copartner to God (ashraka), even if he does not intend to do so"9. The Rafidites are also accused of tashbih in the opposite direction; not only of likening God to man, but of likening a man, the imam, to God as well. The Rafidites who profess the imamate of DjaTfar maintain that an imam is endowed with knowledge from his creation, and that knowledge is his nature. He knows the hidden things and what is within the bounds of the earth and heavens, and for him there is no difference between day and night. He also knows the actions of men and what is in their hearts. Al-Kasim refutes this doctrine saying that the knowledge attributed by the Rafidites to their imam can rightly be attributed to God alone. Al- Kasim further asks how the Rafidites can state that the imam knows by nature, whereas God's messenger, Muhammad, was not endowed with knowledge from birth and knowledge was not his nature. The Prophet knew only after he had learnt. This is proved by the verse &lt;&lt;Did He not find you going astray and then guided you&gt;&gt; (sfira 93, v. 7) and also by the testimony of the Prophet himself stating that he was not originally a prophet, then became a prophet and so with regard to his mission and knowledge 00. Lack of knowledge must be attributed to all people to avoid likening anyone to God, since God has not ceased to know (lam yazal 'aliman), but His creatures know only after ignorance'01. Had the prophets and imams described by the Rafidites known the hidden things, they would not have died as a result of the poison they had eaten 102. Al- Kisim quotes some Kur'anic verses (siira 46, v. 9, suira 9, v. 101, suira 31, v. 34, suira 16, v. 78) proving that the Prophet and the people do not know the events that will take place in the future'03 c. Al-Kasim rejects the Rafidite doctrine of equalizing the imams to the prophets. The Rafidites claim that their imam knows what the prophet Muhammad knew, and enjoins the people to believe what Muhammad enjoined them for. According to them there is no difference 9 See Kitdb al-radd 'ali al-rdfida, pp. 313, 315 (MS. Berlin, fols. 112a-1 12b). The principle of denying the likening of God to creation (tashbih) is so important in al-Kasim's eyes that the believer must know the heretical views concerning tashbih in order not to adhere unknowingly to them and hence to attribute a copartner to God. See al-Kisim Kitdb al-kati wa'l-kitdl, in The Theological Epistles, p. 288, 11. 4-5 (MS. Berlin, fol. lOla). ibid., Sifat al-'arsh wa'l-kursi, p. 251,11. 14-15 (MS. Berlin, fol. 97b).

ABRAHAMOV [25] between the imam and the Prophet except the fact that the Prophet was sent to the people 104. Al-Kasim's refutation of this doctrine is expressed in his opposition to the principle of takiyya and to the immoral behaviour of the imams. d. According to al-Kasim, the principle of takiyya contradicts the Rafidite claim that an imam is like the Prophet in his qualities and actions, since Muhammad did not take precautionary measures to dissimulate his belief nor was he hidden from his enemies, but openly preached his belief and refuted his adversaries 105. In Kitab al-radd 'aia al-rawifid al-Kasim's arguments against the Rafidites are sharpened and given in detail. They can be summarized as follows: 1. Some of the imams, for example 'All, al-Hasan and al-Husayn, did not behave according to the rules of takiyya. 2. God calls people not to associate with God's enemies and not to fear the evil-doers. 3. God requires people not to conceal the right way and the signs He has revealed. 4. An imam cannot serve as a guide for people while being hidden. 5. Muhammad openly acted for the benefit of his community 106. e. Finally al-Kasim rejects the immoral behaviour of the Rafidite imams, accusing them of being attached to earthly desires such as loving money and living in luxury, and this cannot be the description of'All ibn Abi Talib, al-Hasan ibn'All, al-Husayn ibn'All,'All ibn al-Husayn (Zayn al-'Abidin) and Muhammad ibn 'All (al-Bakir) 107. The imams are accused of collecting the fifth part from merchants, craftsmen, farmers and porters108. The Imamite Shi'ites have tended to claim for their imam a fifth of any profit and income, to which according to siira 8, v. 41 the Prophet is entitled of the spoils. The Zaydites have rejected this conception. Answering a question concerning the fifth, to which the Prophet is 104 See Kitdb al-radd'ald al-rdflda, p. 321 (MS. Berlin, fol. 1 14a). 105 See ibid. 106 See Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-rawdfid, MS. Berlin, fols. 107a-108a, 109a. 107 .The list of imams prepared by al-Hidi, al-Kasim's grandson, does not mention 'Ah ibn al-Husayn (Zayn al-'Abidin) and Muhammad ibn al-Husayn (Al-Bakir). 108 See Kitdb al-radd 'ald al-rawdfid, MS. Berlin, fol. 106b, 11. 22-28, fol. 107a, 11. 24. The collection of a fifth of many different commodities has been accepted (Cf. &lt;&lt;Maks&gt;&gt;, Shorter Enc. of Isl.), although Muslim Law seems to permit the collection of a fifth only of spoils and natural resources See &lt;&lt;Fay'&gt;&gt;, El2, vol.II, p.869. ibid., &lt;&lt;Bayt al-M5l&gt;&gt;, vol.1, p.1142. Al-Kasim sharply criticizes his contemporary leader of the Rafidites, 'All ibn al-Hadi, saying: &lt;&lt;Has he helped someone of you or changed his state? We have seen actions of his which are appropriate neither to a prophet nor to a believer. We are ashamed to describe them in our book?&gt;. See Kitdb al-radd' ald al-rawdfld. MS.

But the paying of the alms too must be done only when there is a rightful imam, who will put the alms at the disposal of those who are justly entitled to them. The Prophet's family is entitled to a fifth. On the one hand al- Kasim wishes to oppose the Imamite claim to widen the concept of spoils, thus calming the Muslims as to their property, and on the other hand he wishes to strengthen the claim of the Prophet's family to a fifth of spoils contrary to the Sunnite teaching109. 109 See Madelung, Der Imam, pp. 147-148.
