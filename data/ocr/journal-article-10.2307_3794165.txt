<plain_text><page sequence="1">r PARVATI BRONZE STATUE FROM SOUTH INDIA</page><page sequence="2">On the back of the handle the initials A. H. are engraved in block letters, standing for the name of Andrew Hamilton, of early Phila- delphia fame, one of its early owners and in whose family it has remained until purchased by the Museum. The mark which is as- sumed to be that of Johan Nys is found on the base and twice on the lid of the tankard. Time and. frequent polishings have nearly oblit- erated his mark-a heart-shaped cartouche containing an irregular I N over a small cross-but it is nevertheless undeniably the same as the one here reproduced, taken from a porringer in the possession of Mrs. Arthur Howell. Perhaps it is not without interest to note that a heart to enclose the maker's initials was frequently used by silver- smiths of this period. We find it in the case of Francis Richardson and, in New York, Benjamin Wynkoop used it, and other contempo- raries of Nys. Apart from the porringer noted above, all the other examples of Nys' work are tankards; one in the possession of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, one owned by Samuel Wheeler Morris, and a third by a New England collector. Unquestionably Johan Nys made many other objects, but probably he did not set his mark upon them. In the case of the tankards, however, they were important, owned only by gentlemen of means and position, and the fashioning of them was undertaken with pride, and upon the finished product the maker almost invariably stamped his mark that it might not be forgotten, when it was admired, that he was the craftsman who had made it. A South Indian Bronze WITH the image of the Dancing Siva described in the January issue of the BULLETIN, the Museum acquired a second im- portant South Indian bronze of approximately the same date, representing Siva's consort, the principal female deity that is figured in Saivist sculpture. Both are the gifts of Mr. Charles H. Ludington and are of the utmost interest as additions to the Museum's collection of Indian art, as much from the point of view of esthetic value as of iconography. Devi, "the goddess," wife of Siva and, even more, the tangible expression of the female energy (Sakti) of Siva, is, like all the deities of Hindu mythology and religion, known by a great variety of names, some descriptive of her attributes, such as Uma, "light," Gauri, "the yellow or radiant," or Mahadevi, "the great goddess"; others dis- tinctive of her origin such as Haimavati, "daughter of Himavat" and Parvati, "the mountaineer." Again she is described as Sivakami, "the darling of Siva" and Siva Kama Sundari, "the beautiful lady of Siva's desire." Such a multiplicity of names (and be it said this list could be ten-fold increased) points not only to the universality of the Devi's power in the minds of her worshippers, but as well suggests 9</page><page sequence="3">that in her person are merged many minor deities, Dravidian village goddesses of earlier epochs, revered for special benefits supposed to be conferred upon their local followers, whose existence has long since passed out of memory, and whose attributes and titles have been transferred to the supreme goddess. Parvati is probably the commonest appellation for Siva's consort. In this name we glimpse the legend of her birth and parentage as related in the Puranas. Daughter is she of the god Himavat, the personification of the Himalayan mountains, and of his wife Menaka; hence she is called the mountaineer or daughter of the mountains, and is sister to Ganga, the sacred river Ganges. When Parvati is represented in the company of Siva she is shown with two arms; when alone with four; hence we know for certain that this particular image was originally associated with a statue of Siva, possibly with a Nataraja, or in any case with some manifestation of the god. In the Museum's bronze, she stands in the center of a lotus pedestal that rests in turn upon a square, stepped base, fitted at the four corners with rings through which rods could be thrust when the image was to be borne in processions. Her body is swayed a little to the left in the position known as sama bhanga ("easy sway"), forming a strong contrast to the pose of arrested activity marked by the Nataraja image. Her right knee is ever so slightly bent, and her weight is shifted to her straight left leg, giving the impression of unconscious ease and grace. In her right hand, held with the palm forward in the kataka gesture, she bears the bud of the blue lotus, symbol of loveliness; her left arm hangs at her side (lola hasta) in a natural pose with the hand held a short distance from the thigh, a position prescribed for the left arm of all female figures in South Indian art. The strict canons that guide the sculptor, moreover, require that Parvati be richly decorated as befits the consort of Siva. Upon her head is the conical head-dress known as karanda mukuta, made up of chased bands and strings of jewels, and terminating in a finial shaped like the crown of a lotus. Behind her head is set a circular plaque set on a boss extending from the base of the head-dress. The significance of this disk is not quite clear, possibly it represents a shrunken halo, for on the back it is marked with rays deeply cut and extending to the toothed edge. Below the lower band of the coronet may be seen the even plaited locks of her hair falling in a semicircle a short distance down her back. The ear ornaments are elaborately fashioned and hang far down on her shoulders with festoons of strings of pearls (bahu malai) ending in jewelled pendants. Har- monious bands encircle her upper arms and half a dozen heavy ring bracelets are at her wrists. About her neck and falling on her bosom five various necklaces may be seen and below them a double string of pearls or beads (like a two-fold sacred thread) passes between her breasts, over a jewelled zone at the waist, and encircles the body. 10</page><page sequence="4">She is clothed in a dhoti or long, tight-fitting trousers of some rich figured fabric; Dr. Coomaraswamy in describing a similar figure in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, suggests that the cloth may be batik, yet it seems more likely that it is some richer stuff, especially since the scrolled design is not particularly typical of batik, rather of the gold and silver brocaded stuffs known as kincobs so often illus- trated in Indian miniature paintings. This garment is held fast at the waist by three ornamented belts, the loose ends of which, escaping from the jewelled buckles in front may be seen fluttering at either side. Rings similar to the bracelets at her wrists grace her ankles, and about her insteps are bead bands with chased clasps. The goddess's features are frankly and calmly expressionless, but it is the lack of expression that typifies the face of a deity, not the vacuity we see in inferior modern bronzes. A goddess-like repose of countenance, aimed at and achieved by the use of few lines, few planes, the artist content to suggest by subtle accent rather than to clutter with elaborate sculptural details, herein lies the keynote of the satisfaction we derive from the features of Parvati. The body is in all well proportioned and we find in the rounded limbs the nubile grace that makes the Nataraja so attractive. Though it is inevitable that to western minds the apparent distortions and strange additions, common in all Indian art, pictorial as well as sculptural, such as Par- vati's wasp-like waist and the four arms of Siva, must seem at first outlandish, yet when it is realized that it is an effort to show the superhuman qualities of the deities, to remove them from the sphere of familiar forms, then we see the beauty of this mode of treatment and realize that here is more than a mere anthropomorphic expres- sion of a vague religious concept. In writing of the Nataraja we have gone over the difficulties. attendant upon an effort to assign the bronzes of South India to definite dates. While we may rest fairly certain that this image of Parvati, judged stylistically, is contemporary, or nearly so, with the Dancing Siva, yet this merely permits us to say that it was made within the range of some three hundred years-from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century-and no closer approximation can be safely ventured. This is not an uncommon form of representing the goddess: two statues of Parvati in the same pose are in the Boston Museum, one in the Musee Guimet, Paris, a number in the Museums of India of types varying from the earliest and crudest of the older, simpler schools of sculpture to the frankly modern reproductions. 11</page></plain_text>
