<plain_text><page sequence="1">Terrorism and Rhetoric in the Works of Francis Ponge By GERD HENNIGER Nous avons pousse a bout la Terreur, et decouvert la Rhetorique. Jean Paulhan Paulhan's discovery that every terrorism invents a new rhetoric - hence, rhetoric is perfected terror - not only clarifies the dialectic of Ponge's work, but it also elucidates his essential role in French poetry. Rimbaud and Lautreamont lived out their damna- tion in the Augian stables, which Apollinaire celebrated in song and which the sur- realists wanted to blow sky-high; Ponge, on the other hand, has managed to proceed from the manure, with which he has decorated the Augian stables, to a state of jubi- lation. Naturally it is a question of language, the language of our society, which at best can be made use of in an art of deceit. When Ponge began to write, the question of how to salute beauty was hardly a problem, and right after a world war, the proposition that poetry should be written by everyone appeared to be a mockery. And what of the descent into the depths of consciousness that Apollinaire predicted and which turned out to be the road taken by the best of his contemporaries? Ponge's despair, however, was too skeptical to submit to the belief that language could bring into the light of day the messages of the subconscious in a pure form. If poetry was still possible at all, then only as an "art of resistance against the word? To be sure, Ponge acknowledged as his goal "the founding of a rhetoric," yet this rhetoric was not to be a prescription for formal language, but rather a subversive technique which would still enable us to speak. ("Rhetorique," Proemes). Because the "pompiers" (firemen) want to extinguish the fire of destruction, the terrorist mingles with them and during the extinguishing of the fire provokes a deluge: "So, let us make words ridiculous through catastrophe, simply by abusing them" (Proemes). In order to achieve affirmation, creative nihilism operates through negation of that which is established. Applied to language, this means repairing the regular abuse of words with resolute incorrectness, that incorrectness which appears as a program in Ponge's earliest writings. Against the old order, which was logical and based on ideas, the new order of things can only assert itself in a seemingly a-logical manner. Not outside of the old order, but rather through the conscious falsification of its values, the human mind will be cured of a way of thinking that uses language as a mere system of designations; language constitutes a reality that must be reconciled with the reality of the world it designates. Rhetoric, in this context, means making use of the self -awareness of man as a language-producing being who can put an end to his alienation from the world. Long before social alienation, there was an aliena- tion caused by logic, which was the root-cause of man's being sick of himself. But in contrast to irrationalism, which rejects logical thinking, Ponge uses the evident</page><page sequence="2">716 BOOKS ABROAD destruction of logic as a new beginning: "Down with intellectual merit! This cry of rebellion is still acceptable. I do not want to stop there - but I will praise stupidity by resorting to an abuse of any kind of technique; of course, I would prefer to abuse the technique of language or RHETORIC to all others!" ("Pas et le saut," Proemes). This methodical terrorism pursues its goal to transform damnation into truth, indeed a lifelong concern. A quarter of a century later the renewed proclamation of faith reads as follows: "We know that we successively invent anew the WORST errors of the styles of past ages" ("Le monde muet est notre seule patrie") . "We want to be DISTURBED in our thinking" (ibid.). To be systematically mistaken takes one clos- est to truth, but before achieving this, the formal concept of truth must be destroyed. If each form, each way of living, constitutes a special type of damnation, for example, the shrimp as symbol of the circumlocution, then what is meant by this is that rhetoric must be lived and to be sure, in all the ambiguity such a necessity makes inevitable. The belief that rhetoric is being as well as form is derived from a poetical experi- ence which mediates between two well-known philosophical positions: "Things are already as much words as things, and conversely, words are already as much things as u/ords" (La jabrique du pre) . This fusion of word and thing defines truth as the unity of the two, whereas previously truth was defined as their correspondence. The objection that superstition prevails here could easily be made, since for Ponge that which is designated is not a representation but rather a referent. The psychic boundary zone between word and thing is repressed in favor of a direct coupling of word and thing; and it is precisely through this coupling that the text, in which the representa- tion returns, becomes an animating symptom. Although the text actualizes nothing but "thing-ness" it nevertheless remains anthropomorphic, for what is true for the thing, is true also for the word: "One does not escape trees by means of trees" ("Le cycle des saisons," Parti pris des choses). Yet the language of the object-poem is con- crete in so far as it embodies things instead of meaning them while, conversely, things attain a verbal reality. This mixed game, according to Paulhan, is the essential atti- tude of the terrorists: "He continually takes words for things and things for words" (Les fleurs de Tarbes) . This is, from the standpoint of formal rhetoric, a confusion which leads to the objectification of the text; from the point of view of an ontological rhetoric, it is the only possibility for working toward a union of word and thing: "In this manner the complete work of an author can itself in time be considered an object" ("Raisons de vivre heureux," Proemes). What this kind of materialism actually accomplishes is more important than the fact that it may seem Utopian. It is no accident that in the context of such thoughts Ponge introduces concepts such as contemplation or meditation. Are we aware that spoken language is a physical reality, namely formed breath, breath which we our- selves form while speaking? Our idealistic consciousness still lags behind the material- ity of man. If we were to speak as consciously as Oriental wise men breathe, then we could sense the presence of the thing in the word, and we could understand that writing can evoke a manifestation if the act of writing is conscious of letters to the same degree that the act of speaking ought to be aware of sounds: "LETTERS, mysterious objects accessible to only two senses and yet more real, more pleasant than signs- I want to bring you again closer to substance and to remove you from your</page><page sequence="3">HENNIGER 717 specific quality. I want to make you loved more for yourselves than for your meanings" ("La promenade dans nos serres," Proemes), The aim of Ponge's materialism is to demonstrate the dependence of the consciousness upon the material existence of lan- guage and writing; this concreteness, due to its foreordained connection to the world of objects, transforms the human mind into the interaction between the world of objects and that of words. Contemplation, meditation, then, would be a conscious stressing of this function- ing or, in case it is disturbed, its restoration by means of language. However, that which disturbs and makes writing necessary is the self-glorification of thinking, which in turn has to be disturbed. The attitude of the terrorists, contrary to what an arrogant proverb maintains, demands that the intellect not stand above things, but renounce its usurped power of command over the world. With the decomposition of the given language, and the falsification of its structure, comes a subversion of the ego which culminates in self-sacrifice: "I am not the first who has noticed that the birth of the text demands the death of the author" (P. Sollers, Entretiens avec F. Ponge) . At this point, where terror suddenly changes into rhetoric, both are revealed in their naked- ness; their dialectic becomes a struggle in which Eros is victorious over Thanatos, for what does unification of word and thing achieve now ofter successful death? "It is their copulation which is realized by writing (true or perfect) ; it is the ensuing orgasm which provokes our jubilation" {La fabrique du pre). This knowledge now achieves a carnal meaning; it possesses bodily that which it loves. After decades of patient struggle with language, which camouflaged its lack of concreteness with reason, comes the legitimate happiness which culminates in the certainty that "I have given pleasure to the human mind" ("My creative method").
