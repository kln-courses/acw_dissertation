<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PLACE OF REASON IN HISTORICAL CHANGE R. F. Arragon M ICHAEL POLANY? has recently writ ten that, to him, "there is no justifica tion for demanding freedom of thought unless you believe that thought has a power of its own."1 Those who have the ories on the dynamics and patterns of historical change, that is, philosophies of history, will be likely to value freedom for systematic truth-seeking inquiry in proportion to the importance they give this reasoning and the knowledge it se cures as a factor in molding society and culture. Two themes are to be treated, the role of reason and the theory of the cycle, both of which appear in Greek thought in political and ethical terms and in modern thought in broader context and joined to ideas of continuity and process not present in ancient theory. Man's control of his collective affairs through taking thought was not first dreamed of by modern planners. It was the theme of Plato's Republic and Laws and, with a more modest objective, of Aristotle's Ethics and Politics. Justice, the end of the state, or the polis, was for them an object of inquiry, something to be known. Recognition of it, whether as a Platonic idea or as the Aristotelian community of interest among citizens, and discovery of the means of realizing it were not intuitive. Natural inclination and habit were important but were not enough. Reason was essential to the philosopher-king and to the statesman, and educational curriculums had key places in both the Republic and the Poli 1 Michael Polanyi, The Logic of Liberty: Re flections and Rejoinders (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951), p. 193.

Reason was, moreover, not simply a means of social control. It was an end of the state, in that rational knowledge of virtue and justice was the requisite of the good life as well as of responsible participation in directing social action. The governance of society by reason did not, however, mean for Plato and Aristotle the recognition of it as a means of continuous and therefore progressive historical change. They were concerned rather with preventing change, once the just government or one that was directed to the common interest had been estab lished. The just distribution of benefits would, in Aristotle's view, by the bal ance of interests tend to assure stability and to lessen the danger of revolution. Change was a function of lack of bal ance. The extremes, no longer mediated, got out of hand. Such change was natural but bad. It was the result of the self seeking and power-corrupted aspect of man's nature, the natural depravity that overshadowed reason in the world of ap pearances and condemned the philoso pher who returned from the light of the sun to destruction at the hands of the shadow-watchers in the cave. Not even an ideal constitution for the polis seemed immune from corruption. Plato made clear the alternatives?the shaping of the state through inquiry into and knowl edge of justice and the degeneration of the state because of men's blind egoism? and pointed to the outcome. Since philos ophers could not be kings, the history of the polis was the pathology of regressive change. Plato's ideal scheme of regression from 193</page><page sequence="2">194 JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION the rule of philosophers to timocracy and on through oligarchy and democracy to tyranny was, in its dynamic of moral de cay, like the Hesiodic descent from the golden age through the bronze and hero ic to the iron age. It was also like the Herodotean commonplace of the over throw of the prosperous and the proud because of hybris, a pattern that antici pated the medieval wheel of fortune. The ancient political cycle followed this pat tern. Its moral fatality lay not so much in a decline of governmental forms from monarchy to aristocracy and then to de mocracy (which is reminiscent of the Platonic scheme) as in the degeneration of each form into disorder as the result of success. Polybius thought that escape from this fatality might be possible in the case of Rome by the Aristotelian principle of balance through the mixture of forms; but, when he saw here, too, the signs of disintegration, he accepted the organic inevitability of decline, thus making the cycle a life-cycle as well as a moral one. Machiavelli, too, adopting the antique political and moral sequence, held equilibrium impossible. The implications of the cyclic theory for freedom of thought were suggested in the efforts of ancient literary critics to explain the decline of literature under the Roman Principate. The problem as stated by Tacitus (in the dialogue On Oratory) and by Pseudo-Longinus (in the essay On the Sublime) was whether the loss of literary power and especially of spoken eloquence was due to the loss of political liberty. Did freedom "feed the imagination of the lofty-minded," while "servitude, though it be the most righteous," was "the cage of the soul"? Tacitus, even if he were to answer in the affirmative, seemed willing to accept the consequences of servitude, since security was to be preferred to freedom. "Great and famous oratory," said one of his speakers, "is a foster-child of license, which foolish men called liberty, an asso ciate of sedition, a goad for the unbridled populace." Such was the interpretation of freedom of speech in republican Rome and in democratic Athens. The author of On the Sublime had a similar view of license, but he gave a moral interpreta tion to literary decline by using the cyclic sequence, wealth, extravagance, ostenta tion, vanity, and luxury and hence inso lence and lawlessness?appetites, he said, that, if not restrained, would set the world on fire. To this moral decay he at tributed the lack of sublimity in litera ture. Two kinds of freedom of thought ap pear to be involved?that of public speech and democratic politics, which was considered destructive of society, and that of the lofty-minded poet or philosopher, who, as in the case of the Stoic sage, had subjective, personal free dom, the self-sufficiency of the man of rational moderation, unmoved by the pressure of men and circumstance and by passions. Socrates represented and was authority for both kinds of freedom. He was the self-sufficient philosopher when he drank the hemlock and the fos terer of sedition ( even perhaps the soph ist) when he refused to give up the role of the gadfly. The paradox was height ened by the Athenian democracy's con demnation in Socrates' trial of the public and social exercise of freedom of thought (essential to the democratic conduct of the assembly and law courts), with the result in the case of Plato that intellectual freedom was driven from the agora into the academy and became the self-suffi ciency of individual, or private, reason. Plato's abandonment of politics was an anticipation of the shift of philosophical emphasis, by the end of the fourth cen tury, to internal freedom of thought. The dignity and security of rational man lay in his reliance upon himself in an indif ferent or hostile world or in his con templation of the eternal and changeless in nature amid the Heracleitan flux of appearances. He could defy, disregard, or, with Marcus Aurelius, dutifully en dure the state and history. This philo sophical solution suggests the Sophoclean</page><page sequence="3">PLACE OF REASON IN HISTORICAL CHANGE 195 tragic attitude toward man's predicament and the nature of his responsibility. Such self-sufficient reason was not viewed as a factor in historical change, and its free dom was subjective. I shall not follow this private reason into its Christian form, the contemplative life, except to note that the latter, like its neo-Stoic predecessor, gained its sanction from the universal reason of nature and of God. This reason, writ large, was au thority for human knowledge. Hence man's reason could be more than internal and defensive; it could be directed to the world about men. The design?that is, the laws?of universal reason could be understood. Why, then, should the de sign not be inquired into, and, what is more, since it shaped man's environment and his nature, why should not man by understanding these through his own reason use the laws of physical and hu man nature to shape his individual and social course, that is, to make history? The confidence of Descartes that rigor ous method would give such knowledge as might enable man (given the chance) even to re-create the material world as God had created it and the confidence of Bacon that empirical inquiry would con tribute to the betterment of man's lot in dicated the grounds of the idea of mate rial and social progress through reason, the philosophy of history of the Enlight enment.2 An essential component or corollary of the idea of progress was that, in the variety and conflict of opinion, truth could be rationally discerned and would triumph in the interchange of argument and of evidence. Not only could freedom of thought be trusted. It was required to assure enlightenment and progress, for these were dependent upon the inquiring, testing, nonauthori tarian quality of reason. The doctrine of Milton's Areopagitica belonged with the progressive philosophy of history, which 2 Cf. Descartes, Discourse on Method; and Bacon, Novum Organum and The Advancement of Learning. was thereby the historical theory of lib eralism. This theory took its stand not only upon the moral dignity and responsibility of the individual (antique and Christian in origin ) but also upon what was essen tially linked therewith, the basic, poten tial rationality of every man which en abled him to cope with the problems of religion, economics, and politics as well as with the control of the physical world, that is, to be free in the shaping of his course of life in adjustment with that of others. Reason was natural to men. In the possession of it as a quality, despite differences of degree, men were uniform in nature and hence had natural equality as members of the species. Reason was the means to utility. Through its calculation, conduct could be regu lated and the future in some measure foreseen and directed. It organized soci eties, through social contracts, discovered natural law and natural rights, and shaped institutions and legislation for the greatest good of the greatest number. Rationality was at the heart of the idea of progress. What reason needed was freedom from unnatural impediments? from religious and metaphysical dogma, from superstitious old wives' tales, from the false comforts of the mind and the fears of innovation that make men will ing to accept things as they are. Indeed, unrestricted by external authority, reason would liberate itself and all men from the internal impediments. Rational prog ress was thus linked with liberal individ ualism in a philosophy of history that evaluated past and present by the meas ure of enlightenment and looked to the future of cumulative scientific knowledge and of the expansion of rationality among all men. The hope was bright from Bacon to Condorcet3 to Comte and to Marx. But would any special action be neces sary to free reason and man? Born free, 3 See Marie J. A. N. Caritat, marquis de Con dorcet, Esquisse d'un tableau historique des prog?s de l'esprit humain.</page><page sequence="4">196 JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION he was everywhere in chains to legal hin drances and discriminations, to conven tions and superstitions, to passions, even perhaps in spite of a naturally moral and social disposition. Confident reason, ex ploring and establishing the design, or law, of nature as it actually was, tended to become impatient and dogmatic. A clean break was evidently needed, per haps a revolutionary break, to insure a new age. The fresh start and freedom from the past that Descartes and Bacon had sought for the philosophy, or science, of nature was advocated by some later thinkers not only for social philosophy but for the social order itself. Society needed positive guidance?legislation, education, even violence. Men might have to be forced to be free or at least to recognize the authority of science and of the elite that possessed it. With intelli gence passing from the theological and metaphysical stages to the scientific, the causal laws of physical and human nature were, or could be, known and could and should be put to work for men's advantage. Thus Comte, impa tient at the slowness of Frenchmen and others to recognize what "positive" sci ence could do, urged the institution of a cult of humanity to provide emotional support for a rational system.4 Dogmatism was encouraged, moreover, by the application of the idea of causal determinism to history. The necessity that linked events, whether on the anal ogy of mechanical and statistical laws, as for Cournot, or of chemical or biological mechanism, as for Taine, seemed to en dow causal patterns with a scientific cer tainty that made the sequence of events explicable and predictable.5 The dog matic accent given to reason is particu 4 Auguste Comte, Cours de philosophie posi tive and Syst?me de politique positive, ou trait? de sociologie, instituant le religion de Vhumanit?. The latter is represented in English in H. Martineau's translated condensation as The Positive Philosophy (New York: D. Apple ton &amp; Co., 1853) and in The Positivist Library of Auguste Comte, trans, and ed. Frederic Har rison (London: Reeves &amp; Turner, 1886). larly noticeable if the method of thinking about history is made the principle of the actual pattern of the historical events that are being thought about, as in the case of the Marxian dialectic, which was and is both scientific method and inevita ble process. British empiricism and laissez faire, however, resisted the Continental tend ency to scientific authoritarianism. Buckle6 as a philosopher of history was not less assured than Comte, Cournot (with qualifications), and Marx in affirm ing the causal regularity of human be havior ( at least in statistical terms ) and in seeking the laws, and he, too, saw in men's reasoning and scientific knowledge the means of progress. But progress for him was the freeing of men from author ity. Power, whether of climate and other natural phenomena or of the church and the state, was in his view oppressive, and escape lay in reason. The course of hu man progress was from domination by the physical environment and that by in stitutions of authority to rational free dom. Marx himself envisaged, after dic tatorship had cleared obstacles, the with ering-away of the state. Even more dubious for the recognition of the historical role of free rational in quiry than the authoritarianism of scien tific reason was the doctrine of the immanence of reason. This reason, rooted in human cultural tradition, was a psy chic and organic principle, manifested in social change or development. It was a historical force, whose meaning emerged in what came to be considered the proc ess of social evolution. Adumbrated by Burke and Montesquieu, this idea was 5 A.

It had been Lessing's interpretation of Jewish-Chris tian history. Lessing treated reason as the culmination of the divine training of man through revelation in a three-stage pattern that anticipated Comte's less the ological scheme.8 Before Lessing, Vico's "new science"9 (a historical, in contrast with Cartesian, or mathematical, science) had made the activity of eternal and in finite mind all-pervasive in history. Man could know as true, rather than as mere ly certain or on authority, only that which he made. Hence he could know, first hand, mathematics and history; but, whereas the former was abstract and its application in the natural and other sci ences second hand, the latter could be known directly through human experi ence. Mind could understand its own ac tivity, could evaluate its own results. His tory was the course of mind in time, and, if this mind was not precisely divine reason (Vico did not admit such divine immanence), at least it was human rea son in a universal sense, common to the nations and manifesting divine provi dence. Herder, like Vico, suggested a more immanent activity of reason than did Lessing. History is a whole, a chain of sociability and of civilizing tradition, the result of the collaboration of individuals ?individual men, great and small, peoples or nations, arts and sciences, each 7 Edmund Burke, Reflections on the French Revolution (New York: P. F. Collins &amp; Son, 1909); Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws (New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1900); J. G. Herder, Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit (Berlin: G. Hempel, 1879). 8 G.

Bergin and M. H. Fisch, The New Science (Ithaca: Cornell Uni versity Press, 1948). in its place and time contributing unique ly to the tradition. Tradition was de scribed as the 'Voice of God" and also as reason (Vernunft), the sum of the ob servations and practices of our souls. To gether with goodness and love, it fights against the wild forces to create order and in due time triumphs over them. Though whatever can happen anywhere, does happen, reason and justice alone endure. Herder's progressive optimism rested not only upon reason as scientific understanding but upon reason implicit in the growth of human culture as a so cial bond linking men across time and space. This progress was open-ended, not following an a priori design, for rea son was both the means and the end, the tool and the product, in which the in finite all-fulfilling revealed itself. Hegel's philosophy of history10 was like Herder's in important respects. Hegel was more systematic and coherent, less poetically fertile in suggestion than Herder, more abstract and inclusive in pattern, less concrete and detailed in application. Moreover, his very meta physics was historical, in the sense that its central feature was change, or be coming, and that the dynamic principle of change was rational. Every historical event, therefore, though unique in its actuality, was a manifestation of a uni versal, rational spirit, but it was not pre determined according to an a priori pat tern for Hegel any more than for Herder. The driving force in historical change was the curiosity of the spirit, that is, of universal reason, to know itself through its manifestations. Men as such individ ual manifestations would seek to know themselves and hence, in a limited way, the spirit. Through self-knowledge would come self-release, or freedom, a subjec tive sort of freedom, it would seem, ex cept that self-knowledge would be for Hegel the objectification of the self. Self determination would take place in the 10 Georg W. F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, trans. J. Sibree (London: H. G. Bonn, 1857).</page><page sequence="6">198 JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION growth of self-consciousness. For indi viduals this consciousness and its attend ant freedom would be through recogni tion of their participation in universal reason, and they would be more or less free according to the measure of such self-discovery. Hegel gave the theory a political emphasis by making social or ganization, or community?that is, men's common consciousness with their fellows ?the means of participation in the uni versal spirit. Law and morality were nec essary for freedom. The rational moved in society as it did in abstract thought according to a dia lectical structure from thesis to antithesis and synthesis. As later with Marx, the historical sequence was like a special kind of sequence in reasoning. It may be easy for historians to point out the in adequacy of the dialectic as an explana tion of history, but they cannot readily dissipate the pervasive influence of the doctrine that thought and historical proc ess are akin, indeed are the same. Rea son thus gained an omnipotent, but am biguous, place in historical change. If ra tional thought was immanent in the proc ess, what was left for the reason of men? And what was the need for their un hindered pursuit, exchange, and testing of ideas? Even though the process was considered to be open-ended, freedom for the individual might seem to be self abandonment to participation in the process rather than freedom of inquiry. Moreover, the process of self-discovery of the spirit had, if not fixed ends, a pat tern, and, though protean in application, this rational design of history was au thoritarian in tendency. The resulting ambiguities may be illustrated from two philosophies of history strongly influ enced by Hegelianism?namely, Marxian dialectical materialism and the theory of life-cycles. In Marxianism, as in Cournot's causal linkage and in any scientifically oriented deterministic view of historical causality, the role assigned to reason is clear in so far as reason is claimed to be the observ er and systematic interpreter of inevita ble processes, physical or psychological. The doubt is whether reason can as an agent freely and significantly, as Cournot thought, control the historical movement through knowledge of the causal system. The rational and progressive nature of Marxian historical theory has been strongly maintained in recent years, especially in the face of naziism, by such Marxist writers respected in the West as Luk?cs, the Hungarian literary critic, and Needham, the British biologist.11 Man and society are still considered perfect ible, and confidence in science and tech nology seems not to have been lost in the Soviet Union. The questions raised by this position are both practical and theoretical. Is the rational inquiry free, that is, self-determining, and allowed to make its way amid the challenge and support of other free inquiries on its own merits as judged by this court of reason, or is it recognized to be rational only if it conforms to the pattern, or perhaps rather to certain patterns, of dialectical reason assumed to pervade the move ment of the physical world and of man kind? Moreover, since the movement of thought would likewise be determined by the dialectic, departures from ortho doxy and bourgeois ideologies might be considered to be necessary steps ( antith eses) in the cancellation and inclusion (Aufhebung) of themselves and their opposites in the inevitable syntheses. If so, need they be checked by political in terference, or is this, too, an action of the dialectic and so a means to the truth or the self-discovery of the reason? I do not 11 Gy?rgy Luk?cs, Schicksalswende: Beitr?ge zu einer neuen deutschen Ideologie (Berlin: Aufbau-Verlag, 1948); Joseph Needham, Time, the Refreshing River (New York: Macmillan Co., 1943); Karl Marx, Capital (Max East man's selections from the translation of Julian Borchardt's abridgment, in "Modern Library" ed.

What becomes of human reason as a significant and "free" factor in social and cultural change if change is both inevitable and inevitably rational? Better that it fight the wild forces, expecting success in the long run with the aid of Herder's God, or that it face with tragic consciousness of inadequacy even overwhelming odds of unreason, than that it reconcile itself with the irrational or simply the non rational by calling these rational. The confusion is at least equally great if the words "reason" and "mind" are made synonymous with 'liumanity" or the "human spirit," Welt-Geist, Zeit-Geist, or Volk-Geist, in such a way as to include the irrational with the rational, the un conscious with the conscious. In this case, as in that of the dialectic, reason, by becoming the process itself, the very inner dynamic of historical change, is swallowed up in the process. It would be meaningless to speak of reason as effect ing historical change. It is the change. In fact, the dynamic principle need not be reason at all; and after Hegel it tended to become, with some, the will, the blood, technology, or Existenz. In any case what need has process for freedom of thought? If immanent reason (or unrea son) is (metaphysically) free to mani fest itself in historical forms (according to the necessities of its nature), the free dom of men to inquire and to discuss is irrelevant except as inquiry and discus sion happen to be at certain times the technique of the spirit for effecting changes in its manifestations. The modern revival of the cyclic the ory bears on this exception. Hegel, and Herder as well, despite their rational progressivism, contributed to the cyclic view of history. The notion that a people or the human race is unified by some immanent reason or spirit that shapes culture and history readily suggested that separate peoples or the whole of humanity are anthropomorphic organ isms. Herder described speech as the "physiognomy" of a people or nation and attributed to every art and science growth, flowering, and decay; but he ap plied the life-cycle from childhood to high age not to individual nations but to the race as a whole. For Hegel the mani festation of the rational spirit in a partic ular nation was definitely an organic cycle. The fulfilment of its purpose ex hausted that nation's reason for being. Its zest for life, its intelligence, were gone, and its continuance as routine was equivalent to death. This was a psycho logical and biological interpretation of the dialectic. The nation's loss of interest in life was because of the removal of contradiction by its success in realizing fully what Hegel called "its subjective being," that is, all the meaning of which it was capable as an expression of the spirit. Such realization was self-discovery of the spirit in this particular national form, and hence its self-destruction?the Aufhebung in the synthesis as prepara tion for a new purpose and higher con ception in another national life. The ambiguous relation of immanent and human reason and of authority and freedom again emerged here. The spirit, in making itself the object of its own thought, destroyed this determinate form of its objectivity. Hegel likened the process of the ripening of the life of the people to a certain fruition, which is the distillation of a poison draught that the people cannot let alone. Or, more specif ically, the Greeks, through the influence of universal reason, reflected upon their own beliefs, customs, and obligations, recognized the limitations of these, de manded grounds for obeying them, and, indeed, questioned authority in general. Such was the work of the Sophists and the meaning of Socratic inquiry to the end of knowing one's self. Human rea son, in seeking to understand itself and society, undermined both. Though this self-immolation was in the service of progress, or the movement toward a high er self-revelation, it made men's reason</page><page sequence="8">200 JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION appear as an enemy of the sense of com munity and of social order?in fact, of the continuance of the national life. Freely inquiring individual intelligence seems to have been, if not a cause, at least a symp tom, of decay. We are reminded of Herder's dis paragement of scholarship and books as stifling to the understanding but fortu nately destroyed by many sorts of revo lutions, which providentially brought fresh air to men's souls. Learning and cultivation were built on the originality of the Natural Man, who was narrower but sounder and t?chtiger than his suc cessors. So, too, was the wisdom of the British Constitution sounder for Burke than that of the French doctrinaires. Reason immanent in nature or in an evolving human society and in its cultur al tradition had, it seemed, a social and moral authority to which critical reason, the solvent of authorities, could not as pire. The freedom which the latter claims may well be suspect to the adherents of the former, especially if the aim of the claimants is a revolutionary break with the past or if the freedom appears to be the license associated with the self-seek ing individualism of the disintegrating phase of the ancient political cycle. In this respect the Hegelian cycle fits into and can be made to reinforce the moral dynamic of the cyclic tradition from Athens to the Italian Renaissance and after. This tradition had, indeed, a cen tury before Hegel, been joined by Vico to the idea of history as the unfolding of reason. The cycle was interpreted by him as a rhythm of the mind from barbaric force and superstition to humanity and rationality, only to collapse in luxurious individualism. The outcome of Vico's cycle seems to have been as conclusive as was Hegel's. Its dynamic, however, was human degeneration rather than the dia lectical self-immolation of reason, and hence the progress of humanity from cycle to cycle was not assured by Vico's theory as it was by Hegel's. Of the three cyclical theories recently most popular in America, Spenglers is the most anti-intellectual in tendency. To him, critical, inquiring reason?the "ni hilism" of Socrates and Rousseau?was a mark of the maturity of a culture that had already become civilization and was ripe for decay. The place of critical thinking in Toynbee's scheme is more complex. It is surely needed for working out re sponses to the successive challenges that a culture must face and is connected with the transformation of these challenges and responses into higher, or more ethe real, forms. Yet the schism of the soul that characterizes the death throes of civiliza tion is like the breakup of social cohesion, which in the cyclic tradition is associated with the freedom of thought that is called 'license." Toynbee's remedy would seem to be in religion. Sorokin's whole system is based on the movement of thought and feeling, from the "ideational" culture through the "idealistic" to the "sensate" culture and back to the ideational; but the reason of scientific investigation, the skeptical reason of the Enhghtenment, is for him a sign of the onset of sensate culture (materialistic and disintegrating) rather than of the sound metaphysical rationality of the ideational.12 The uncertainty of the place of reason and of freedom of thought in these cyclic schemes is due partly to the differences in the use of the word "reason." Is it reasoning, that is, putting two and two together critically for the discovery of the unknown, even unsuspected, relations between things, events, or ideas, or is it an order of ideas, a law of nature, that is established or accepted as rational? The authority of the latter is challenged and tested by the criticism of the former. And why should it not be? Unless it de 12 Oswald Spengler, The Decline of the West, trans. Charles F.

Another cause of uncertainty is the fact that cycles without progress from one to another offer no hope of cumulative achievement by taking thought freely. Even Toynbee's seem doomed to ultimate fatality. The theory of reason immanent in the historical process (whether this is cyclic or linear) is deceptive in its effect upon the place assigned to thought and to free dom of thought in historical change. It might appear that it would encourage rational exploration and innovation as the means of progress through increasing self-knowledge. And so it does in the philosophies of history of Croce and, es pecially, of Whitehead. In these contem porary progressive, noncyclical theories, freedom is the condition and goal of the creative activity of free rational intelli gence. Croce's emphasis, in keeping with the idealistic tradition, is upon the moral significance of rational liberty. White head directs particular attention to the importance of speculative, or inquiring, reason as an agent of progress in the emergence and development of ideas.13 The doctrine of immanence may, how ever, gravely compromise confidence in the capacity of rational inquiry and of the freedom necessary for such inquiry to shape the history of man and society. The idea that there is a universal princi ple of change within the very process of historical development lessens the im portance of man as the maker of his own destiny, whether the immanent principle is the organic inevitability of the cycle or 13 Benedetto Croce, History as the Story of Liberty, trans. Sylvia Spriggs (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1941); Alfred N. White head, Adventures of Ideas (New York: Mac millan Co., 1933). the relentless dialectic movement of so ciety toward Utopia. It matters little whether the principle is called "rational" or * nonrational." Even asseverations of the open-endedness of the process have not prevented authoritarian conclusions. An immanent principle of change, though it makes everything else relative to the historical process, seems itself absolute and suggests that its pattern of the proc ess is in some way preordained. Critical reason, the dissolver of such principles, appears irrelevant, if not worse, and the freedom it demands is suspect. What can be more rational than that which history is in the process of bringing into being, and what is more free than that which is in accord with this process? Such are presently persuasive conclu sions drawn from the unqualified belief in the inevitability of progress, from or ganismic cyclical theories, and from the doctrine of the immanence of reason (or unreason) in history. If we need not hold one or more of these views, perhaps we can still maintain, in the face of contem porary social and intellectual crisis, a less coherent and more exacting philosophy of history, one that gives fallible but critical human reason two complemen tary and hence, we may hope, not wholly incompatible roles. On the one hand, it would, by public exercise with the req uisite freedom and good will, have some power to change men and society for the better, to modify, perhaps even to direct, the "wild forces" of which Herder was aware. But, if it fail or in proportion as its success is limited (and Umitation is to be expected), it would maintain men in the tragic and philosophic view of the dignity of man against circumstance, not the quietist independence through with drawal but the self-confidence of having sought to do what reason could do.</page></plain_text>
