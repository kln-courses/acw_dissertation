<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM MR. BACHE'S FIRST REPORT ON THE JOINT EXCA- VATIONS AT TEPE GAWRA AND TELL BILLAH, 1932-3 DECEMBER 1, 1932 The third season of excavation on Tepe Gawra opened on November 2, 1932, with the following staff: CHARLES BACHE-Field Director PAUL BEIDLER-Architect and Assistant Director 8</page><page sequence="2">ELISABETH B. B. BACHE-Registrar IMMANUEL BEN-DoR-Archaeologist CYRUS H. GORDoN-Epigrapher E. BARTOW MtULLER-Architect ARTHUR C. PIEPKORN-Fellow of the School and Epigrapher On the first day we started off with about 80 workmen, and within a few days this number had been increased to 145.. It has since been reduced to 130, at which point I will hold it for the balance of the season. Our first task this season was to ascertain whether there was any possibility of connections between the walls of stratum VIII still standing and any walls of IX. It having been established that (with one excep- tion) there would be no possibility of a connection, all the walls of VIII were removed, leaving our one hopeful standing. This was the work for a long period of our four weeks' digging, since, all the time that VIII walls were being destroyed, we were on the lookout for "tie-ups" between the two strata. Work in mud-brick is ticklish and is perpetually in need of attention. 4i 5, cm$~~l~II ~ BBgl~I ~ :: :8:: W E klxlil,?! ,?, NQ SM:ic C. M j.,.

The last vestige of VIII has now gone, and I must confess that it rather saddened us all to see the destruction of such a stratum. We had small hopes of ever again finding such buildings on Gawra. But as will be seen later, it turns out that IX may be as fine as VIII, and if such be the case, then we have undergone a period of needless depression. Between VIII and IX there seems to be a sub-stratum VIII. It is most fragmentary and occurs so far chiefly under that part of VIII which was near the temple on the west corner of the mound and under the deep rooms of VIII that had two windows opening into the pebbled courtyard of last year. The three pavements of sub-VIII are about thirty centi- metres below the bases of the walls of VIII. There are so far no walls of sub-VIII, the extent of the rooms being delineated by the extent of the pavements. One of the pavements, whose extent is indeterminate, bore a podium, vaguely anthropomorphic. It is about a metre and a half in length, and 80 centimetres in width. The central part (i.e., the anthropomorphic 9</page><page sequence="3">part), is depressed a little, being 15 millimetres below the edges. We found nothing to indicate in what relation it was placed. A peculiar structure was found in square 11-N. It is L-shaped, one side consisting of two steps and the other of one step. Made of libn (mud-brick), they are coated with bitumen, and I cannot attempt to assign a reason for their existence. Between VIII and IX there have been found nine infant burials, almost all of which were in jars. In a few instances, beads, invariably of stone, had been placed with the body. Besides the infant burials there have been a few other graves, one of which is a stone tomb which con- tained nothing but the badly preserved bones of a half-grown child. :.:..:.: i.?.:.::.: :::??:. . .......... ....:::. ...... ....... ... . . . . . . . . ..? ? ? ????.? ? ??:?: :. ? ? : ?... : . . . . . . . .. .. .. ... .. ... .. .... . .. .. .. . . . i Plan of a building ("The Priest's Residence") with recessed walls from Gawra VIIIa. The entrance faces northeast. Other burials between the strata have all been of the loose type, contain- ing nothing beyond an occasional bead or two. In the work on this area we have come across a series of rooms of stratum VI. Naturally, when Gawra was occupied in the time of stratum VI, the people may have required more space than the top could give them, and therefore they built their houses down the side of the tepe in terraces. We have found these below the level of stratum VIII. Their foundations, typical of VI, are of undressed stone, and from the rooms come typical VI pottery-smooth, hard, green-gray ware, with hardly any tempering, and with incised decoration. At the very edge of the tepe we have found another well, this time with stone walls. It is about 3 metres 10</page><page sequence="4">in diameter, occurs definitely in stratum VI, and it is possible that we may be able to attack it from the side, rather than from above, the latter being inadvisable because of the danger of stones falling from above. Stratum IX is not extensive to date. We have not had time as yet to make a large showing as regards walls and objects. But what it lacks in area is many times made up for by what it has yielded in quality. Stratum IX has produced almost an exact duplicate of the very fine building that was found last year on the westernmost edge of the tepe, called "The Priest's Residence." Its long walls have three crenellated niches, its rear wall also has three niches, and the front walls each have one. In the center of the front is the same small entrance-court (there is no reason for assuming that it was covered) that the temple of VIII had, .*;.~ ?*mm --117' V,1 7f* :4n: vo'. ""'Ix Curiously incised diorite tablet from the lowest stratum of Gawra (Speiser: 1931-2). and in one of the rooms there is the same libn structure in an outside, contiguous room of the later temple. Continuing this really amazing resemblance is the fact that in one of the rooms of the temple of IX we have discovered a quantity of seal impressions on sealings of jars and baskets, found lying on the floor of the room. It seems hard to believe that the two temples were not designed and built by the same men. Certainly the small room from which the sealings have come must have been used in both of the temples for the storage of votive offerings brought by worshippers of the temple. They all bore the same impression. Dissimilarities between the two structures serve to make them the more interesting. The temple in IX faces in exactly the opposite direc- tioni, which naturally reverses the order of all the rooms, and still the similarity of the buildings is preserved. The most striking difference is of the utmost impqrtance. There is before the entrance in the central room, on the pavement, a podium, made of the hardest stamped clay, almost like concrete. The podium is strongly marked with burning, 11</page><page sequence="5">especially at the center, and none of the rest of the room bears any trace whatever of burning. This makes it certain that this podium, if no other, was used as a hearth, and since it is in the temple, probably for ritual purpose. Other walls of IX are slow in coming up. So far we have been unable to tie the temple up with any other walls of its stratum. The next few weeks will be of great interest. Among the objects found may be mentioned a comb and a hairpin which compare most favorably with objects of any season, and from any Mesopotamian site. They are both made of ivory, and the hairpin is decorated in the central portion with lapis lazuli and green stone lozenges of diamond shape. It is further ornamented with four bands of gold which also served to strengthen the fragile object. -jM . .... Stone and alabaster amulets from Gawra VI (Speiser: 1931-2). Both of these objects were found in a grave not far from the north- western edge of the tepe, in the square 9-K, near the temple of VIII found last year in that region. The grave was made of libn walls, and had been covered with rushes, as a roof. The mould of the oxidized rushes was found over the top of the libn walls as well as over the body. Both objects were found at the head of the skeleton, which was con- tracted, head facing the south. Nothing else, to our disappointment, was found with the burial. Other objects found during the last four weeks, while of interest, are not startling. We find almost exactly what we could expect to find- hammer-stones, spindle-whorls, loom weights, figurines, flint and obsidian implements, arrow-heads, weights, and pottery, of course, in quantity. Cylinder-seals come only from the debris of other years, as we have evi- dently passed the time limit for them. Button-seals we find in our own stratum, occasionally one of ivory, sometimes fragments of plaques. There was also a variety of minor finds, but they need not be taken up at present. TELL BILLAH DECEMBER 10, 1932. As we decided in Philadelphia before I left for this country, a very small force, about thirty workmen, was started at Tell Billah on Novem- 12</page><page sequence="6">ber 2nd. Following our decision to dig in the Assyrian section in the hope of obtaining more inscribed material, I started the workmen near the region from which Dr. Speiser recovered so many tablets in the previous season. Naturally, with this number of workmen, we did not expect great or immediate results. Nor were we disappointed in this expectation. We did not get them. The digging began just where it left off last year. We found the usual number of intrusive graves, generally containing beads and in one case there was a very nice crescent earring of gold, exactly similar to those found last year in similar graves, and on exhibit in the museum. One of the most interesting of these graves may be here described briefly. The head of the skeleton was found in one jar, the feet in the other. There were no objects discovered with this burial. Its walls were made of libn and it is one of the more pretentious tombs of Tell Billah. .. .......... ..... ..... ..... ...... ... :,..r .. .. .......?s ::l~l ::....... :?' ?' 4V 72iil: -41w ll. ...,.M M . Y". o K...'n? ? .: ? AM??:i? Work in the Assyrian section, Tell Billah, present campaign. A few rooms were developed, but there was nothing extraordinary about them. The usual libn walls, and pavements of stamped clay. In the short time that we worked in Billah, I feel that the results have been satisfactory. From one of these rooms there came four fine bronze objects: two bowls, one large vase, and one small vase. These were all heavily corroded, and extremely fragile, there being practically no metal core left in any of them. So fragile they were, that none of us dared to clean them beyond giving them a cautious brushing, and they were placed on a shelf in the museum, awaiting the expert attention that they deserved. Recently Mrs. Immanuel Ben-Dor has joined us, volunteering her services and travel expenses. Since she is a graduate chemist, and has worked on the Warka objects in the Berlin Museum, we turned these bronzes over to her, with the most unexpected and amazing results: one of the wine cups proved to bear a votive inscription, and on two of the lines of the inscription there had been the ancient name of Tell Billah, so that by putting the two lines together, i.e., by adding together the signs dis- 13</page><page sequence="7">cernible thereon, our epigraphers have been able to tell us the ancient name of Billah, viz.: Shib-ba-ni-ba [this reading is very doubtful; further study must be awaited], as predicted last year by Dr. Speiser [and, pre- viously, by Forrer (E. A. S.)]. Other objects from Tell Billah, or rather, from Shibaniba, have not been wholly without interest; of especial note is a "double-decked" lamp. I know of but one parallel to it, one that was found in Nuzi in the deep room while I was there two years ago. Pottery is of the ordinary Assyrian type. Of seals and seal-impressions there is a woeful dearth. The few fragments of seals are all of baked clay, and too fragmentary to determine what was carved on them. Two weeks ago I had work on Tell Billah temporarily stopped. I felt that thirty workmen could do little, and that I would rather concentrate in Tepe Gawra. The change released at least one member of the staff for Gawra, and benefitted our work considerably. Ramadhan starts in three weeks, and at that time I think that I will withdraw the Yezidi workmen who are on Gawra, and start them on Billah, working there full strength, leaving Gawra, regretfully, until the end of that most trying season. After Ramadhan, we should have at least one full month on Gawra.</page></plain_text>
