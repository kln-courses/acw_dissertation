This year marks the 20th anniversary of the genesis of the print workshop, when two graduates of printmaking from the Crawford College of Art and Design, Patricia Morteli and Sinéad Ni Chionaola undertook to address the absence of professional print studio facilities for artists in the south of Ireland. The studio's first board of direc- tors, comprising Morteli, Ni Chionaola, the artists Brian Kennedy, Vera Ryan and Joseph Philpott, secured Arts Council and Cork Corporation funding, which continues to this day. Cork Printmakers provides for its eighty-five fulltime members, and part-time associates, a fully equipped, professionally run, open-access print workshop. Under the guiding hand of its Director Clare Hennessy, and Assistant Director Frances O'Connor, and the supervision of two print techni- cians, Johnny Bugler and Peter McMorris, the studio offers facilities in time-honoured processes such as woodcut and etching, lithography and screen printing. The studio is also equipped with the means to produce photomechanical imagery including photoetching and members have access to the most current computer software and digital printing facilities. The studio is a welcoming place, and like all well-run artists co-operatives, it provides its members with the support mechanisms they need to create art. Many artists benefit greatly from the opportunity to work in a communal envi- ronment. The artist Paula Rego described the collaborative approach of a print studio as a 'wel- come change', as opposed to the 'alone confrontations' of her work as a painter. The studio organizes regular exhibitions to raise members' profiles and to generate income, with a least one major annual exhibition. While, unfortunately, the studio does not have a permanent commercial outlet, members' prints are available for sale to the public from the administrative offices of Cork Printmakers. Any future plans for the organization should include a designated dis- play area and commercial outlet. In the past, the studio has participated in a number of touring exhibitions, some of which were done in collaboration with other Irish print studios and others that were solely the work of Cork Printmakers members. Earlier this year, the studio sent an exhibition entitled 'Ireland: Alphabet Series' to the Irish Arts Center in New York. Working collaboratively, twenty-six members created a print based on a single letter of the alphabet, their challenge was to create an 'Irish' alphabet that reflected both contemporary Irish culture and the diversity of approach among members. In November 2011, Cork Printmakers members are collaborating with their colleagues from Limerick Printmakers and the Belfast Print Workshop on a project entitled '24 Hours' as part of 'Art Trail', an arts festival held annually in Cork City which facilitates arts events beyond the walls of the gallery/museum. Twelve artists will collaborate on the theme 'the national interest' to create a body of work in one day, which will be exhibited in the Cork Printmakers' studio space. The event will be streamed live on a dedicated website - allowing viewers to witness the creative process and the dynamics of a working print studio. While its primary function is to serve the needs of its members, the studio also recognizes the importance of public participation in the arts and undertakes a number of activities to raise its profile. Over the years it has developed a significant educational programme, pro- viding courses for those interested in learning printmaking. Furthermore, studio artists work regularly with third-level art under- graduates, primary and post-primary school students and with com- munity groups. For an organization such as Cork Printmakers, outreach programmes and teaching workshops provides the studio 3 1 EILEEN KENNEDY b. 1 962 SOUNDWAVES 2008 etching, edition of 6 20x20cm 2 AOIFE LAYTON b. 1 979 FUGITIVE 2010 mezzotint and drypoint 30x25cm 3 BRIAN BARRY b.1 978 THE ECHO BOY 2010 linocut, printed with road-roller on paper U0x220cm WINTER 2011 I IRISH ARTS REVIEW 93</page><page sequence="3">PRINTS CORK PRINTMAKERS AT TWENTY k ing, through public and private sponsorship. These projects serve to raise the profile of the studio among the community. However, as for other national arts organiza- tions, Cork Printmakers' administration and members have to negotiate the challenges of earning their keep, so to speak, and raising public awareness of their activities, whilst ensur- ing that such projects do not impede on the primary function of the studio to provide artists with the facilities to produce art to the highest standard. However, this is a balancing act that Cork Printmakers manages very well, and it has developed and implemented a number of particularly innovative outreach programmes. In November 2010, initiated and devised by Cork Printmakers, the studio worked with the third-level students of CIT Crawford School of Art and Coláiste Stiofáin Naofa on a lino print project entitled 4 Impressions of your City - Large Roller Project ' Linocut, a medium that is traditionally asso- I costs prints ment, created open lenges are makers understandable well-ordered, because members accomplished produced print involved. manpower made facing of in by studios. are the Ireland, in contemporary Cork with structured, and Consequently, among the that processes, and Given the country inventive.

Consequently, it is understandable that many of the prints made in the country today are produced with the support of open print studios. Given the chal- lenges facing contemporary print- makers in Ireland, the works created by Cork Printmakers' members are among the most accomplished and inventive. In well-ordered, structured, sociable surroundings, artists are provided with the wherewithal to explore and test technical bound- aries, and to best express their artistic vision. Some members work within traditional formats and methodologies; others exploit digital media; many others take an inclusive, multi- disciplinary approach, combining processes of the past with the technologies of the present. The subject matter of their art ranges from the figurative to abstracted forms and from intimate, subjective investigations to engaging with broader universal themes and popular media culture. Traditionally, print is categorized as a handcrafted, inti- mate form of art that addresses the individual physically and thematically. Many artists remain attracted to these qualities, whilst continuing to test and expand boundaries. Debbie Godsell has created a series of work that layers print processes with other applied techniques such as appliqué and collage on a variety of surfaces (Fig 6).

However, for this project all participants worked on lino blocks that were 100x180cm, each of which was designed, drawn and cut by the respective artists and stu- dents. A 2.5 tonne road roller was hired to print the com- pleted blocks in an industrial warehouse in Cork city. The event was open to the public, over 300 of whom also partic- ipated in the relief print workshop on site. The artists involved embraced the freedom and the challenges of work- ing on such a scale for the first time. The printmaker Brian Barry produced a life-size image of Cork native Micheal O'Reagan, who sold The Echo newspaper on the city's streets for fifty years (Fig 3). It is a bold, stark, yet humane image, which also reflects the physical engagement and visual directness of the process. Barry avoids any sense of nostalgia or romance, but rather creates a gritty representa- tion of a character immediately recognizable to many Corkonians. It is arguable that choosing to work in print requires a greater commitment than that of painting, simply tions are inspired by 19th-century Irish grand domestic inte- riors, their collections and ornamentation. Presented in circular or oval format, the works evoke the delicacy and concentration of traditional needlecraft, whilst embracing the contemporary concerns of deconstruction and materiality. At first, Sylvia Taylor's beautifully crafted relief prints of anthropomorphic animals appear naive and playful. However, describing the creatures in her work as autobiographical alter- egos, these forms provide Taylor with means to examine all aspects of human existence. In Escape Velocity ; a caged pea- cock and a marshmallow-roasting squirrel see-saw precari- ously over a writhing sea from which emerges menacing heads of bear-like creatures, the future for each uncertain (Fig 7). Taylor executes her images with an admirable sparseness and refinement demanding close inspection from the viewer, whilst inviting them to create their own narrative. Aoife Layton's meticulously produced figurative prints are deeply contemplative works addressing themes of presence, absence and memory.

The child in an insect costume acts as a signifier, representing man's primitive and animal- istic instincts, a theme regularly addressed by the artist. Layton's chosen technique of mezzotint is a demanding and difficult one. The artist works back into a dark ground to create a tonally rich and atmospheric print, which imbues the scene with a dreamlike quality. While many Cork Printmakers' members produce figurative works, a number choose to work within an abstract idiom. Eileen Kennedy's Soundwaves is a minimalist work, compris- ing bands of deep colour juxtaposed with fine lines that echo those for musical notation (Fig 1) Interestingly, Kennedy did not choose to present the work in a pristine ш or sterile manner. Despite its robust geo- metrical forms, there is an organic qual- ity to the print as seemingly f unintentional, scratched lines from / ^ the plate interrupt the surface.

Marianne Keating has produced screen- printed wall papers that, rather than evoking a sense of domestic security, create disquieting environments that immediately demands the viewer's engagement with the work. In Macropsia , Keating plays with scale, as gradually enlarging insects invade the viewer's space and senses (Fig 5).

Untitled , by Eimearjean McCormack, is a series K| of screenprinted and digitally printed images on newsprint (Fig 4). Suspended unframed, they are pho- tographic reproductions of early 20th-century Irish republicans from Cork, Terence McSwiney, Michael Fitzgerald and Joseph Murphy, all of щШЯЯЁ^Яг whom died on hunger strike in 1920. The images are superimposed with a quoted text from Terence McSwiney and depictions of the Virgin Mary. The figures are presented in an iconic fashion, larger than life and removed from their original context. Each figure is 'gagged' with a white or black cross, they are voiceless, their relevance today uncertain. Echoing somewhat the work of Christian Boltanski, through image manipulation McCormack challenges us to question the veracity of the images and what these reproductions represent for audiences today. Cork Printmakers will celebrate their 'coming of age' in 2012. After twenty years maturing, the organization has become an essential resource for artists of the region and beyond, and is a major contributor to Cork's artistic and cultural life. And, most importantly, it is well-placed to assist its members, now and into the future, in their quest to express themselves as artists, as printmakers. ■ Acknowledgments: The author would like to thank the administration and artists of Cork Printmakers for their assistance in writing this article.
