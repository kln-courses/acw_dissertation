<plain_text><page sequence="1">ETHNOPOETRY AND THE ENMERKAR EPICS ADELE BERLIN UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND AS A FORMER STUDENT OF PROFESSOR SAMUEL NOAH KRAMER, under whose guidance I first read Sumerian epics, it is a privilege and pleasure to offer here a paper which continues his tradition of comparative studies of epic literature.' It is limited to a discussion of the tales of Enmerkar and Lugalbanda, and addresses itself to ways of viewing these tales from a folkloristic perspective. Little is known about the origin of the Sumerian epics. An oral stage is assumed, in conformity with current views in comparative literature, but, of course, this is not recoverable.2 Our only knowledge of the epics comes from written texts. There are hints of a written epic tradition from as early as the Fara Period,3 but it is not until the Ur III Period that we find clear evidence of a heroic epic tradition. Furthermore, as has often been noted, the early rulers of Ur III, Urnammu and Shulgi, themselves claim kinship with the ancient heroes of Uruk who are the epic heroes.4 What is the significance of this claim? Since there is a strong likelihood that Urnammu was actually a native of Uruk, Sumerologists often assume that the epics were preserved (or composed-at any rate, took written form) because of Urnammu's personal origin. That is to say, had it not been for this link with Uruk, these epics would not have been preserved; and con- versely, there may have been cycles of other cities which were not preserved because the Ur III rulers had no attachments to these cities. This position is stated most unambiguously by J. Renger: "The ... heroic epics of Enmerkar and Lugalbanda owe their continu- ing existence to the fact that . . . the Third Dynasty of Ur originated in Uruk, the city of these epic rulers."5 But this is putting the cart before the horse. It seems more reasonable that the Ur III rulers, whether or not they had actual ties to Uruk, claimed Uruk origins because of the existence and acceptance of the epics. First of all, the epics do not preserve local traditions, as Renger suggests. With the exception of Gilgamesh and Agga, none of them depicts local rivalries, but rather they show Uruk opposed to a foreign enemy. They are thus implicitly nationalistic, in a broad sense, with Uruk symbolizing the entire nation (as will be dis- cussed below). One need not hail from Uruk in order to identify with its past. Uruk as a symbol of national supremacy was rein- forced by historical events closer to the time of Ur III; the overthrow of the Gutians and the re-establishment of Sumerian hegemony is credited to Utuhegal of Uruk (Dynasty V). Thus Uruk became a paradigm of Sumerian national strength, and its ancient heroes "Heroes of Sumer: A New Heroic Age in World History and Literature," PAPS 90 (1946), 120-30; "Sumerian Epic Literature," La Poesia Epica e la sua Formazione, 1970, 825-37. 2 On the oral composition of Sumerian literature see B.

By claiming kinship with Lugalbanda and Gilgamesh, Urnammu and Shulgi were doing more than proving they were the legitimate successors of Utuhegal (whom Urnammu overthrew); they were viewing themselves as the spiri- tual heirs to the ancient rulers of Uruk, i.e., embodi- ments of traditional leadership par excellence (regardless of Urnammu's actual lineage).6 Theirs was a time of extraordinary nationalism, and they called upon the epic tradition to promote it. The epics continued to be preserved, not because they record the lives of actual forebearers of Ur III kings, or historical events, but because they are an expression of national aspirations. EPIC AND ITS SUB-TYPES. In a systematic description of ethnopoetic genres,7 which I use as a model for this study, Heda Jason discusses the characteristics of the epic genre and outlines several sub-genres. Her main sub-genres are mythic epic (positive forces struggle with negative forces in the creation of the world order), carnavalesque epic (a kind of parody of the epic), and heroic epic (which tells of a struggle against a family, tribal, or national enemy, real or fabulous). Heroic epic, which is our concern here, has several sub-types: historical epic, national epic, and universal epic. A final subdivision is romantic epic, which may be classed as a sub-group of either historical or national epic. The components of the epic genre would be thus diagrammed as follows: mythic epic heroic epic carnavelesque epic historical national universal epic / epic epic romantic epic While all heroic epic involves a struggle of significant proportions, its sub-types are distinguished in the following manner: In historical epic "historic or pseudo-historic per- sonages act, and real particular historic events may be described. The themes . .. are struggles against family and national enemies, but the details have no broad symbolic value" (31). In national epic "the characters and events are poetic generalizations of a nation and its enemies, and the struggle between the two. This epic describes typical symbolic events and personages, and not historical particulars. Its theme is the national struggle as a whole" (31). In universal epic "the hero represents . . . humanity as a whole, and is supported by sacred and mythic forces in his struggle with monstrous remnants of mythic hostile forces. The hero himself is of half divine parentage. In this group of epics the mythic world is finally overcome by man" (31). "Romantic epic tells about wooing a bride, or about couples separated by an enemy and reunited after heroic exploits of the husband. The enemy may be real ... or a fabulous being. Here many fairy tale, novella, and legend plots may be utilized" (31). A work is assigned to its genre primarily on the basis of the mode in which it is written. By mode Jason means "man's relation to his world as it is manifested in ethnopoetic work" (17). Three modes are distin- guished: the realistic, the fabulous, and the symbolic. The realistic mode is centered on humans in the real world. Relations among fellow humans dominate, and no forces outside the human world interfere with human affairs. The only power is that of human strength and morality. In the fabulous mode "man confronts various worlds of the fantastic" (18). This mode may contain numinous or marvelous elements- it is a spiritual or fairy tale world. In the symbolic mode the entities "have no properties at all and are used as symbols of properties of real entities" (25-6). While heroic epic is, in general, set in the realistic mode (18), it may include fabulous and symbolic elements (31). Actually, as we shall see, not all types of heroic epic are equally realistic. Romantic epic comes closest to being in the fabulous mode.8 6 The political motive of claiming legitimacy has been recognized by others, e.g. Klein, loc cit.; D. 0. Edzard in The Near East: The Early Civilizations 1967, 135; W. W. Hallo, "The Coronation of Ur-Nammu," JCS 20 (1966), 137. I appreciate the rulers' personal political motivation, but see ramifications far beyond this. 7 Ethnopoetry, 1977. Page numbers cited throughout refer to this work. The terminology which Jason has developed can be found in concise form in Ethnopoetics, A Multilingual Terminology, 1975. Her approach was outlined in "A Multidimensional Approach to Oral Literature," Current Anthropology 10 (1969), 413-26. Also of interest are "The Story of David and Goliath: A Folk Epic?" Biblica 60 (1979), 36-70, and "The Poor Man of Nippur: An Ethnopoetic Analysis," JCS 31 (1979), 189-215. 8 Jason's chart (51) places romantic epic in the fabulous- marvelous mode [the chart erroneously reads "miraculous'].</page><page sequence="3">BERLIN: Ethnopoetrv and the Enmerkar Epics 19 We turn now to the Enmerkar and Lugalbanda epics of Sumer: Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta (ELA), Enmerkar and Ensuhkesdanna (EE), The Lugalbanda Epic (LB), and Lugalbanda-Hurrum (LH).9 The main theme of ELA concerns relations between man and his fellow man (the enemy). The power of the hero comes not from superior strength, but from his cleverness. The general tone of ELA places it well within the realistic mode, in which man confronts man on the human level. It is clearly a heroic epic, and can further be designated as a national epic, as opposed to a historical epic, for although there may be a historical kernel of truth behind the plot, it would be straining credibility to suggest that such a contest of wits as is described actually occurred. The events, and quite possibly the characters-especially in light of the fact that the lord of Aratta is not named-are poetic generalizations of a nation and its enemy.'? The mode of EE is somewhat difficult to ascertain. It seems to be basically in the realistic mode, but has more intrusions from the marvelous than the other three epics (see note 8). It contains talking animals and a transformation combat. Marvelous helpers, a sorcerer and a sorceress, intervene on behalf of human rivals, and the issue between them is decided through magic. The plot indicates that this is a romantic epic, since it involves the wooing of a bride (in this case the goddess Inanna). It is not surprising that EE sounds like a fairy tale, for romantic epic is close to heroic fairy tale." In LB the realistic mode predominates, with some elements of the marvelous being present. The hero, Lugalbanda, obtains superhuman swiftness and en- durance from the Anzu-bird (a mythical or marvelous creature), which later enables him to go alone on a dangerous journey in order to obtain aid from the goddess Inanna for Enmerkar and the army of Uruk. LB seems to be a national epic: It is the need of the nation in its struggle against its enemy which forms the background and motivates the plot, even though the interest in the conflict is subordinated to the interest in the hero, Lugalbanda, who never engages in direct combat with the enemy. As in the Chanson de Roland, the action focuses on events outside of the main campaign. The plot of LH has similarities to that of LB. Lugalbanda sets out with Enmerkar's army to con- quer Aratta, falls ill on the way, and is left for dead by his comrades. He revives, prays to the gods, and is restored to health. The dream which follows, and the subsequent offerings to various deities, seem quite realistic. I would tentatively classify this text as in the realistic mode (based on incomplete knowledge of the text and the fact that its end is not preserved). LH also seems to be a national epic, similar to (if not actually part of) LB. Mode, the relationship which pertains between man and his world, is an important indicator of ethnopoetic genre. At least three of the texts examined here were found to be in the realistic mode-the expected mode for epics. The fourth text, EE, may be either realistic or marvelous. Its mode, along with its plot, point to the fact that it is a romantic epic, a sub-group of national or historical epic. The others are national epics, since they depict a national struggle in super- natural proportions, not strictly adhering to actual historical events. Thus all of the Enmerkar-Lugalbanda epics can be said to be, at this point in our analysis, national epics. This will be confirmed in the analysis of the contentual aspect. Not all Sumerian epics are national epics, however. The Gilgamesh epics, with the exception of Gilgamesh and Agga, lack the back- ground of a national struggle and reflect more uni- versal concerns of mankind battling against the forces of evil or mythical forces. This suggests that they are universal epics. Perhaps this explains why Gilgamesh But in Ethnopoetics, A Multilingual Terminology, 50, she states that romantic epic is in the realistic mode. 9 Textual editions of ELA, EE, and LB are as follows: S. Cohen, Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta (Dissertation, Univ. of Pennsylvania, 1973);' A. Berlin, Enmerkar and Ensuhkegdanna, A Sumerian Narrative Poem, 1979; C. Wilcke, Das Lugalbandaepos, 1969. Plot summaries are found in S. N. Kramer, The Sumerians, 1963, 269-75; La Poesia, 825-28; C. Wilcke, "Sumerische Epen," Kindlers Literatur Lexikon, VI, 2111-15. J. Renger in Heroic Epic and Saga, 28-32 summarizes only "The Enmerkar Epic" (ELA) and "The Lugalbanda Epic" (LB). 'O I am not suggesting that Enmerkar did not really exist, but that here he is serving a supra-historical role. He appears not as his historical self, but as a generalized hero of Uruk. Cf. B. Alster, "The Paradigmatic Character of Mesopota- mian Heroes," RA 68 (1974), 50. " Romantic epic and heroic fairy tale have much in com- mon.

Gilgamesh, from the outset, lent himself to more universal concerns than did the other heroes of Uruk. NARRATIVE STRUCTURE. The narrative structure refers to the patterning of the plot and is independent of the texture of the work. One of the most general levels of structural analysis seems to be that of V. Propp. Originally developed for Russian fairy tales, it has been successfully applied to a wide variety of non- Russian and non-fairy tale compositions.'2 H. Limet has analyzed the structure of some of the Sumerian epics and found that they correspond to Propp's model. 1 For a more specific group of texts, including some Sumerian, Akkadian, Hittite, Indian, and Russian epics, Jason has worked out a proposed structural model for an epic struggle.'4 The central theme of these texts is the struggle of a deity, or of a part- human, part-divine hero against a monster. Although the theme is the combat of a hero against a monster, Jason generalizes: "the core model is the struggle between hero and adversary,"'5 and is thus able to include epics concerning human rivals, such as Gil- gamesh and Agga. Jason does not mention the Enmerkar-Lugalbanda epics, but it seems likely that this model fits at least some of them. It is not my intention to analyze the whole model, or to do a proper structural analysis of the Enmerkar-Lugalbanda texts. I will merely list the functions of the model that clearly fit ELA and EE. None of Jason's texts contain all of the functions, as the model is a composite of the functions of many texts, but it is apparent from a cursory glance that ELA and EE contain enough functions to be "epic struggle" texts. It is not immedi- ately apparent whether LB and LH do also. The functions (and the numbers assigned to them by Jason) that are of most interest are: " This has been possible in part due to a mistranslation of one of Propp's terms. On this see H. Jason and D.

Triumph-community grants triumph to hero (or does not grant triumph). Of interest to Sumerologists in this model are the dominant roles of messengers and community counsel, which, as can be seen in this context, are not peculiari- ties of Sumerian society, but functions of stories of epic struggles. CONTENTUAL ASPECT. The contentual aspect deals with contentual terms, which are the distinctive elements or attributes of the content. Jason classifies them as anthropomorphic terms, zoomorphic terms, spatial dimension, and temporal dimension. I will discuss only selected parts of these four terms. A. Anthropomorphic Terms: attributes of human characters. 1. Physical appearance. There is almost a total lack of physical description of human characters in these epics. We have no idea of the appearance of Enmerkar, Lugalbanda, or anyone else. When a person is described, it is in terms of actions of which he is either the performer or the recipient. For example, messengers are described as running like birds or fleet animals. The sick Lugalbanda is unable to eat fat and cheese (LB 229-230). The hero may be described in terms of the favors shown to him by deities (e.g. EE 91ff.). The most "heroic" description is that of Enmerkar given by the messenger to the lord of Aratta: "My king who is fit for lordship from his birth, The</page><page sequence="5">BERLIN: EthnopoetrY and the Enmerkar Epics 21 lord of Uruk, the sagkal-dragon living in Sumer, who pulverizes mountains like flour, The stag of the tall mountains endowed with lordly antlers, (Beautiful as) the mother-goat (after) being cleansed with soap and plucked, Whom the 'unfailing cow' had given birth to in the very highland" (ELA 180-184). This may be not so much an epic description as part of the protocol which preceded the actual message. And even here the description is in terms of action. Also described are reactions or emotional states, for example, the confu- sion of the sorcerer (EE 248), the depression of the lord (ELA 236) and his elation when he finds a fitting reply (ELA 239-241). Arrivals always seem to be happy (ELA 299, 417, LB 346). One expects an epic hero to be of great physical strength, but this is not so in these works. Enmerkar's prowess lies in sending and answering verbal challenges and outwitting his opponent. Lugalbanda does possess superior physical abilities, but only insofar as they enable him to traverse the distance from Aratta to Uruk. In fact, to the extent that there is description of humans, most of it is lavished on the messenger and not the hero.'6 The Sumerian poets were not incapable of physical description. It does occur in reference to deities, fabu- lous beings, and cities. For example, Inanna has mascara-ed eyes, a white garment, a shining tiara (ELA 590ff.); Anzu's body is described in detail (LB 120-124). The magnificence of Uruk is told at the beginning of ELA and EE, and that of Aratta is found at the end of LB. 2. Distribution of the anthropomorphous terms. In historical and national epics, according to Jason (141), the hero and his adversary are human. Numinous beings may take part, in secondary roles. The gods are the numinous beings in the Sumerian epics, and they clearly have secondary roles. In universal and romantic epics the hero is human; the adversary and/ or princess to be won are mythic or marvelous beings. This is the case in EE, where the "princess" is the goddess Inanna. (And compare Huwawa, the adversary in the universal epic, Gilgamesh and Huwawa.) 3. Fabulous beings. "The epic is an exceptional genre in that it does not possess its own class of fabulous beings but uses beings from other genres. The epic uses both marvelous and numinous beings of all sorts. 17 In historical and national epics all of them play a secondary role, participating in conflicts which are wholly human. They act as helpers of humans who are the principal actors" (156). What could better describe our compositions with helpers like the Anzu-bird (LB) and a sorcerer and sorceress (EE). The gods also serve as helpers. B. Zoormorphic Terms: attributes relating to animal characters. As in the case of anthropomorphous beings, epics may contain both realistic and fabulous animals. The Sumerian epics lack the most common epic animal, the hero's horse, which had not yet been domesti- cated. They do feature a number of fabulous animals. In LB there is the Anzu-bird and its young. In EE there are talking cows and sheep, and a series of domestic and wild animals produced by a magic transformation. Domestic and wild animals are often opposed to each other in various genres, and usually the domestic are "ours" and the wild are "theirs" (163). In EE the reverse is true; the wild animals are produced by the representative of Uruk, and are the natural predators of the opponent's domestic animals. The seizing of the domestic animals by the wild signals the winning of the transformation combat. C. Spatial Dimension. Jason has organized the locations in which different genres are staged into a spatial model of concentric circles radiating out from the narrator. The closest is "our settlement," the immediate surroundings of the narrating community, known in detail by all. "Our district" is the district in which "our settlement" is located. It reaches as far as most members of the community travel in their everyday lives (e.g. to market, to a local shrine). Places and distances within it are known here, too. A more abstract spatial loca- tion is '"our country." The natural and social order of 16 Cf. ELA 106ff., 156ff., 297ff., 348ff., 413ff., 507ff., EE 40-52. 17It is not a question of these elements having been added to a historical core, as one might conclude from Kramer's statement that "the poet does not hesitate to introduce fanciful, folkloristic motifs that can have no basis in historical fact" (La Poesia, 831). These elements are indigenous to the epic genre. In fact, the process has been shown to be the reverse, at least in Russian epics, by A. Alexander, who concludes that "The epic event appears to be not a distortion of a historical event, but rather an analogue of a fairy tale event" (Bylina and Fairy Tale, 85). He explains earlier that "Historical personal names and place names are present in the byliny, but the epic action appears to follow that of the fairy tale rather than history" (ibid., 67).</page><page sequence="6">22 Journal of the American Oriental Society 103.1 (1983) "our country" is similar to "our settlement," and it is perceived as a more or less uniform area; real settle- ments within it and distances between them are not known or remain vague. "This world" includes the rest of the human world. "'The afterworld" is the area where the souls of the deceased exist. Deities may also live here. "The in-between space" is the area between the human world and the afterworld. Fairy tales take place here; it is the abode of fabulous beings. In addition to these areas there are symbolic locations which may occur in "our country," "this world," or "the in-between space." Symbolic locations may be real or imaginary, but are not normally visited by members of the narrating community. For example, Kiev symbolizes Russia in the bylina, but the peasants from northern Russia who have preserved the bylina have never been there. Heroic epic is staged in "our country," an area of settlements with indefinite space between them (197). Real distances between settlements are ignored, so that even in the realistic mode characters can hop from one to another without much concern for geography. In most epics "our country" is opposed to "their country," and the hero travels back and forth between the two. In the Enmerkar-Lugalbanda epics Uruk seems to function both as "our settlement" and as a symbol for "our country." Opposing it is the enemy's settlement/ country, Aratta. Various other geographic locations- cities, mountains, and rivers -are mentioned in the epics; S. Cohen has listed them and identified most of them.'8 From a folkloristic point of view it would be interesting to see how these locations fit into the spatial world of the epics. Discretion should be used when one seeks geographic information from epics, since they do not always correspond to physical reality. For example, the epic tradition knows where Aratta is and what it looks like; but it is doubtful if members of the Sumerian narrating community had ever been there. In the case of Aratta we have, so far, only literary references; the name has yet to appear in an economic, administrative, or geographic docu- ment.'9 It may, indeed, have been a real city in the vicinity of Hamadan,20 but in the epics it functions symbolically, as enemy territory, rather than realis- tically.2' In most epics, the plot is staged in "our country"- the enemy comes and attacks it and is fought against. Rarer are instances where "our" heroes go to the enemy's country (198). The Sumerian epics are in the minority in this matter. Enmerkar initiates the send- ing of messages to Aratta in ELA. In LB the Urukians are besieging Aratta, instead of the reverse. However, in EE Ensuihkegdanna, the lord of Aratta, initiates the hostilities and the decisive magical contest takes place near, but not in, Uruk (in Eresh). Epic space can extend beyond "our country" and "this world" to the "afterworld," from where one sees the gods acting and interfering in human affairs (198). In universal epic the principal battle takes place in a semi-mythic location which seems to be in "the in- between space." One of Jason's examples of this area is the abode of Humbaba (198). While man can travel back and forth between the human world and "the in- between space," the creatures indigenous to "the in- between space" remain there; they do not enter the human world but vanish from the tale when the human hero does so. While none of our epics is a universal epic, there is at least one view of what may be "the in-between space." This is the home of the Anzu-bird in LB. Lugalbanda entered this realm and received help from the bird; but when Lugalbanda left this realm to rejoin his comrades, the Anzu-bird could not follow. The bird led Lugalbanda to the edge of this "in-between space" and then "The bird hurried back to its nest, Lugalbanda set out for his brothers" (lines 218-219). Lugalbanda re-entered the human world, and the Anzu-bird is not mentioned again. D. Temporal Dimension. Just as it is possible to reconstruct a community's spatial perception of the world from the body of its ethnopoetic works, so is it possible to reconstruct its temporal perception. Every society has its own ethno- poetic timeline-the past events and their relative order which occur in folk literature. This time-line does not include every event that has occurred, or even every event of which people are aware. The events that enter the ethnopoetic time-line are chosen on the basis of their meaningfulness to the society, its 18Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, 41-61. 19 Ibid., 61. 20 S. Cohen, Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, 55-61; Y. Majidzadeh, "The Land of Aratta," JNES 35 (1976), 105- 14. 2 B. Alster notes that in at least one context Aratta "represents the mythical city from where wisdom and art was [sic] brought down" (Studies in Sumerian Proverbs, 1975, 128 note 32).</page><page sequence="7">BERLIN: Ethnopoetry and the Enmerkar Epics 23 social system, and its main concerns. For example, it has been found that in tales of Jews from Arab lands, the two destructions of the Temple (586 B.C.E. and 70 C.E.) are telescoped into one; and the expulsion from Spain (1492 C.E.), a major historical event known to the community who still consider Spain their land of origin, is absent. Thus one cannot learn actual history from an ethnopoetic reconstruction, but rather a traditional history of significant events-those events which have become points around which different genres of ethnopoetic literature adhere. From myths, epics, and tales, one can reconstruct a list of impor- tant events and order them chronologically. But the Sumerologist must be warned that this yields a sub- jective history, though in some ways more interesting than an objective history. Likewise, one must distin- guish between the setting of a work and the time in which it was actually composed. For example, myth is set in mythic time, which precedes human time-the setting of the epics; but it does not follow from this that the myths were composed before the epics. Jason distinguishes three basic categories of time: 1) Human time (historical time) which flows regularly. Human time begins at the end of the mythic epoch and ends at the eschatological age. 2) Mythic time, flowing time-in-the-making. Mythic time begins be- fore time exists, and continues through the establish- ment of ordered time. 3) Fabulous time, which flows slowly or not at all. Miraculous, demonic, and marvelous beings live in varieties of fabulous time. Epic is set in human time but occasionally contains bits of fabulous time. Since heroic epic purports to describe historic events, it is clearly set in a particular period in the national time-line-in the specified dis- tant past (as opposed to fairy tales, which are in the unspecified distant past). The setting of some of the Enmerkar-Lugalbanda epics gives a partial national time-line and the place of the epics on it. The most complete setting is in LH, which reviews events before Enmerkar and puts Enmerkar's epoch into perspective. Its story takes place after heaven had been separated from earth (the beginning of time), after agriculture and architecture had been undertaken (the beginning of civilization), after en-ship and kingship had been made to shine forth in Uruk (the founding of Uruk), after the lord of Uruk had been foremost in battle (the rise of En- merkar; several more references follow).22 ELA begins with the building of Uruk and its temple, and Aratta and its temple. The builder of Uruk is Enmerkar himself, so the story can be said to begin with "It was in the days when Enmerkar was building Uruk . . ." That is, it is set in the same general time period as LH (perhaps at the beginning of this period), but does not relate itself to earlier periods on the national time-line. LB begins in medias res, but there is a flashback near the beginning of the poem describing a long-ago period when the Anzu-bird first built its nest. The story, of course, does not take place then (that would be mythic time), but a later unspecified time when Lugalbanda finds the Anzu's nest. After praising the glory of Uruk, EE begins the story with the enigmatic phrase, "At that time the day was lord, the night was sovereign, Utu was king" (line 14). I have suggested that, although the exact meaning is uncertain, it sounds like "Once upon a time, a long time ago"-i.e., it takes the audience far back to an unspecified (unhistorical) time in the past.23 It closely resembles a Yemenite Jewish opening cited by Jason (90): There was not and there was never Neither a judge nor a king, Only God the Supreme, He existed This is the least specific setting of the four epics. But it is a romantic epic, and thus conforms to the expec- tation that "romantic epic is less definitely set and tends more towards the period in which the fairy tale is set" (218). The settings of the epics are structured in what appears to be a formulaic opening structure, dia- grammed as follows: ELA EE LB LH introductory introductory main action hymn hymn u4-ri-a u4-ba u4-ba U4-Ul "in those days" "at that time" "at that time" "in olden ancient setting ancient setting ancient setting times" ancient setting u4-ba -------- -------- u4-ba "at that time" "at that time" main action main action main action main action 22 The text and translation of this passage are found in Cohen, op. cit., 18.

Berlin, Enmerkar and Ensuhkefdanna, 63, 64.</page><page sequence="8">24 Journal of the American Oriental Society 103.1 (1983) The time in which the epic is set is to be distin- guished from the time within the epic itself. Although the epics are set in a "real" period (historical or human time), and some even place themselves in relation to other, more distant events or eras, time within the epics is fabulous. Events occur but the passage of time is ignored. Heroes do not age; the epoch does not end. Enmerkar is still the king; Aratta is still the enemy. Time seems to stand still, freezing us into an unending "heroic age." A similar observa- tion was made by D. S. Lixacev in reference to the Russian epics: The folktale in no way defines the past with regard to the general flow of history . . . The time of action in the byliny, on the other hand, is distinctly localized in a conditional epoch of Russia's past which could be called "the epic epoch" . . . The "epic epoch" repre- sents a kind of ideal antiquity which knows no direct transition to later times. In this epoch Vladimir rules "eternally", the heroes live eternally, many events take place. This, unlike fairy-tale time, is history, but a history without transition to other epochs. The place of this history is "island-like".24 CONCLUSION. The Sumerian epics have been found to share the mode, narrative structure, and contentual aspects of other epics. They are, then, correctly viewed as epics in their own right, and not just as forerunners to later Mesopotamian epics (as is some- times implied in discussions of the Akkadian Epic of Gilgamesh). Now that the basic generic similarities have been established, it remains for the distinctive features of Sumerian epics to be elicited: how do Su- merian epics differ from other Sumerian compositions? I have tried to indicate in a few instances where one may begin such investigations. Sumerologists have always referred to these poems as epics, but have not always appreciated what that generic identification implies. They have persisted in asking historical questions of these non-historical writings-questions such as when did Enmerkar live, where was Aratta, what politico-economic relations are reflected in the poems. These are the preoccupa- tions of modern "scientific" scholars, but they are not the questions that the epics are addressing. It is, of course, possible to learn history, geography, eco- nomics, etc., from fictional literature; but it is a mistake to stop there. Epics are not poeticized history. They use history-like elements for a purpose which is essentially nationalistic. The more fundamental ques- tion is what do these poems teach us about the world view of the Sumerians: their values, their role models, their conceptions of the past, and, by extension, their conception of their national destiny.25 24 Quoted in Alexander, Bylina and Fairy Tale, 90.
