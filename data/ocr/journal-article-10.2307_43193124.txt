<plain_text><page sequence="1">83 Warriors, Chariots, and Theories of Culture Esther Jacobson University of Oregon July 1990 Of all the petroglyphic Images which have comedown to us from Bronze Age Mongolia, none has received the attention accorded that of the wheeled vehicle. Represented by a structure made of two wheels, axle, basket, and (central pole) (figs. 1 , 2), the vehicle has almost invariably been identified as a chariot. The mushroom -hatted figures with which the image is sometimes associated have been referred to as warriors or charioteers. Through the Yedlc/Avestan association of wheels and sun, the Images of vehicles have been considered the solar symbols of a society led by a warrior aristocracy. Both the vehicles and their drivers have been assumed to be the decisive signs of on Indo-lranion contribution to the cultural development of Mongolia in particular and of Central Asia and South Siberia In general. 1 This article will consider the validity of these conclusions by Investigating the representation of the wheeled vehicle In Mongolia and adjoining areas, the representation of related human imagery, and the history of the wheeled vehicle within the Bronze Age traditions of Siberia and Central Asia. It Is not possible to separate a consideration of Bronze Age Mongolia from the Bronze Age traditions of adjoining areas of South Siberia and eastern Kazakhstan. Therefore, this stucty depends upon materials derived from major petroglyphic sites in Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, Tuva, and southeastern Gorno-Altai. Additional materials from the Minusinsk basin and Kazakhstan will be brought In as relevant. (Although the Transbaikal participated In Bronze and early Iron Age developments centered in Mongolia, the wheeled vehicle image does not occur in the petroglyphs of that region. ) This study Is based upon a group of 2 1 2 rock-carved or painted compositions from northeastern Central Asia and South Siberia (Appendix). These compositions all refer to wheeled vehicles and to human activities involving physical and psychological interaction; by style and subject matter all may be tentatively assigned to the Bronze Age ( second and early first millennia</page><page sequence="2">84 BC).2 This material has been gathered from the major publications of Central Asian and South Siberian Bronze Age petroglyphlc material available to me3 as well as from material recorded personally in the Gorno-Altai. Since it is presently impossible to create a complete compilation of relevant visual images, this group must be considered exemplary rather than exhaustive. There is general agreement that the vehicle image appeared In northeastern Central Asia in the second millennium BC. By the period of the emergence of the Scytho-Siberians (c. eighth - seventh centuries BC), it had disappeared from the petroglyphic record. Despite this loss of visual imagery, we know that wheeled vehicles continued to be used at the least by the Scythians and presumably by their more eastern relatives, the Early Nomads of South Siberia.4 One must assume that the disappearance of the image from Central Asian petroglyphs does not reflect an actual rejection of wheeled vehicles as functional objects. The change must be related in part to the rise of horse riding among the Scytho-Siberians, but it must also reflect a decline in the symbolic load carried by the Image within each culture. The image of the wheeled vehicle was brought into a region where traditions of petroglyphic carving were airead/ well established and where petroglyphic images reflected deep cultural roots 1n earlier Bronze Age and Neolithic traditions. Representations of cervids, bovines, caprlds, and humans In ritual reçalla had functioned as the Imaglstlc vocabulary of previous cultures throughout South Siberia and Mongolia. In thô earliest part of the Bronze Age, images hod continued to demonstrate a Neolithic emphasis on the individual animal figure or on the Individual anthropomorphic figure with headdress. Perhaps only by the middle of the second millennium BC did there begin to appear representations of figures in ritual dances, In real or ritual hunts, and figures leading bovines and cervids in what may also have been ritual sacrifices. Among the most commonly repeated subjects are pairs or small groups of figures whose interaction does not involve the use or even appearance oí weapons. These simple statements of Interaction include scenes of copulation or of two men or women holding hands or standing beside each other with an as yet unclear purpose. No less intriguing are a large number of representations of figures or of figures and animals which appear to be engaged in some kind of ritual activity. 5 This Is exemplified by several groups of Images from Khobd-Somon. In one, a large frontal and ithyphalllc archer, bow In hand and legs bent as if in dance, holds the horn of a caprid. Near him were recorded three figures, one of whom has a distinctive headdress with large side loops, the other two of whom may be females squatting in childbirth. &amp; From another site in the same complex, an Ithyphalllc man holds the lead of a large stallion.7 In another Instance, two</page><page sequence="3">85 frontal ithyphallic figures seem to be carrying pick-axes or quivers and weapons at their waists. They stand beside each other, hands raised as If to their necks, in some kind of ritual activity. Beiow and to their right and perhaps related to these figures is the Image of an antiered deer s The figure of a person leading a bovine with ritual fringes, from Elangash, may belong in the category of scenes of ritual activities* as may the representation of two ithyphallic figures leading a female animal, from Chankyr-Kelia in the Elangash complex, In the far southeastern Gorno-Altai.10 Within the imagery of the Mongolian Neolithic and early Bronze Ages, there is a marked absence of scenes indicating actual human aggression, even when weapon imagery is present. At Khobd-Somon, at Tebsh mountain, an Image of a man with drawn bow directed towards a squatting female in mushroom -shaped hat seems ritual in Intent: the combination of figures suggests the repeated acting out of a significant event rather than a specific aggressive action. 1 1 At Khavtsgait, ithyphallic figures wearing tall head ornaments, tails, and possibly quivers face each other with drawn bows. Here, also, the peculiar dress suggests a ritual activity rather than a scene of actual aggression. 12 Related scenes from the Elangash river in Gorno-Altai also suggest ritual "battles" between archers on foot. 1 3 By contrast, a composition from Mugur-Sargol, Tuva, in which two figures seem to be fighting with pick-axes, probably dates from the later Tagar period. 14 So, too, would the Images of figures attacking each other from the Minusinsk basin petroglyphs of Kunln. l5 On the other hand, a group of figures from the Ylnshan mountains of Inner Mongolia must be dated to the Bronze Age by their distinctive mushroom -shaped hats. These figures aim their primed bows at each other, their close range suggests intense interaction. ^ Despite the interaction, however , a number of elements suggest that this battle is ritual rather than real. A number of the figures wear long tai 1-1 ike appendages. From their waists protrude either erect phalluses, or weapons, or both. Their mushroom-shaped hats are similar to those found on a significant number of figures throughout South Siberian and Central Asian petroglyphs; but in almost all those other cases, the figures are engaged In what could only be understood as ritual activity. In other words, among all the petroglyphlc images which by style and subject matter are probably datable to the Bronze Age, the instances of figures aggressively attacking each other is almost non-existent and the nature of that aggression is open to question. Of the 2 1 2 Image groups drawn from the Gorno-Altai , Tuva, and Mongolia and datable by style and subject matter to the Bronze Age (Appendix), almost half include figures and animals In apparent ritual scenes or archerson foot shooting at animals. Within that group of 21 2, the number of scenes involving figures In combat or "shooting" directly at each other is only eight. 17</page><page sequence="4">86 The very lack of representations of human aggression which could be assigned to the second and early first millennia BC indicates that human warfare was not as valued, as least for the purposes of representation, as were ritual activities of various kinds. Furthermore, the lack of representations of warfare or of human aggression on other humans means that if one is to find in the petroglyphic record support for the theory that the second millennium saw the intrusion of a warlike culture, it will have to be found with reference to that supposed instrument of war and prestige, the light two-wheeled vehicle or chariot. The human representations do not demonstrate the existence of that warlike culture. The representations of wheeled vehicles in the petroglyphs of Mongolia and South Siberia have attracted considerable scholarly attention during the last few decades. 18 These images refer primarily to two wheeled vehicles; in a few instances, the vehicles are four wheeled. The range of their distribution includes eastern Kazakhstan (e.g., Karatau, Saimaly-Tash, Tamgaly), Gorno- Altai (eg., Kalbak-Tash.Elangash), Tuva(e.g, Mugur-Sargol), Mongolia ( e.g. , Chuiutyn-gol . Khavtsgalt, Alarln-gol, Khobd-somon), and Inner Mongolia (e.g., Ylnshan). With a few exceptions which will be discussed below, the image of the wheeled vehicle does not occur in the Minusinsk basin or in the Transbaikal region. As one would expect, it is also absent from the taiga zone to the west, east, or north of Lake Baikal. Variations in the presentation of these images appear to have had no regional regularity. 19 Throughout the area of their distribution, vehicles may appear with wheels represented as solid or as spoked with two or more crosspiecss. Although most of the animals represented pulling the vehicles appear to be horses, bovines are also common. In a small number of cases, deer are represented either as pulling the vehicle or in direct association with the animals pulling the vehicle ( fig. 2/G).20 Of the 2 1 2 image groups used In this stud/, 32 include the representation of a wheeled vehicle with driver, 24 include the vehicle and animals alone without driver , and 1 4 show the vehicle alone without draft animals or driver. I know of only one lnstance--tn the Elangash complex-- of a vehicle with driver but without draft animals.21 In other words, whatever the vehicle image referred to in social or mythic terms, the vehicle itself - its wheels, axle, and box - was the most important element, the draft animals were secondary, and the human driver was apparently the least important element of all. Of the 74 representations Involving wheeled vehicles which have been used in this stud/, not one includes any reference to human combat. In one case, this from Chulutyn-gol , the driver of a vehicle shoots an arrow at a large deer ( flg. 2/H).22 The deer , however, is of a type which</page><page sequence="5">87 must be össociated with the period oř the Mongolian deer stones, i.e after 1 000 BC and is done in a style totally different from that In which are represented the oxen pulling the vehicle. Furthermore, It seems unlikely that bovines would be used to pull a two-wheeled vehicle for use in the hunt. These discrepancies raise questions regarding the accuracy of the recording of the image group or they suggest that the deer is a later addition. In only one other instance-this one from a group not Included In the 212 exemplary compositions- - can one find the representation of a hunt from a vehicle. This occurs at Arpauzen V , in the Karatau ridge of south-central Kazakhstan and thus considerably to the southeast of our focus region. Two archers, each standing in the basket of his two-wheeled vehicle, take aim at (?) a nearby capr id (fig. 1/A).2^ In this case there are considerable Inconsistencies between the apparent subject of the representation (a hunt) and the appropriateness of the vehicle and its animals for the hunt. These will be considered below. For the moment we may conclude that wheeled vehicles were not used or were not represented as being used either for the hunt or for warfare. Their function must have referred to some other activity. The origins and chronolog/ of vehicle Imagery in South Siberia and Central Asia remain unverified. On the one hand, there have been no archaeological finds within that area of any vehicle remains which can be dated before the Early Nomadic period of the middle first millennium BC. There have been found no traces of the wood or bronze fittings that might have been used to secure axles or to strengthen wheel naves and r ims; nor have there been found even the earthen imprints of disintegrated wooden vehicles. Chronologically and archaeologically, the remains of wheeled vehicles from Bronze Age burials of western Siberia and from Anyang burials of the Shang dynasty establish historical brackets for the area between, that of eastern Kazakhstan, South Siberia, and Mongolia. They tend to confirm the probability that diffusion of vehicle imagery into South Siberia and northeastern Central Asia must have occurred during the second millennium BC. But what seems historically logical Is not that simple; a review of the relevant evidence Is now necessary. The earliest image of a wheeled vehicle is not from Mongolia but from the Minusinsk basin. It was carved on a large stele from Znaménka ( flg. 1 /B ). The stele belongs to a group of carved monoliths which have been dated variously to the Tazmln, Afanaslev, or Okunev cultures of the South Siberian Neolithic and Eneolithic periods ( third-early second millennia BC). To the right of the mask which dominates the eost face of the stele is the image of a four-wheeled cart Juxtaposed with bovines. The wagon Image Is clearly distinguishable from the two wheeled vehicle</page><page sequence="6">88 images of Mongolia, Tuva, and the Gorno-Altai. It is probable that the Znaménka cart image dates to the Eneollthic Afanasiev culture and represents an addition to the earlier carved monolith.2^ The evidence for such an hypothesis is indirect. We know that the culture of the Minusinsk basin in the late Neolithic and Eneol ithic was that of the Afanasiev. We also know that the people of the Afanosiev culture were Europoid and shared o number of elements in common with the contemporary but more western Yamnaya culture of western Siberia and Kazakhstan. No wheeled vehicles or any evidence of their existence have been found in any Afanasiev sites; but the relationship of Afanasiev to the wagon-using Yamnar/a peoples2^ supports the hypothesis that the wagon image on the Znaménka stone reflects an Afanasiev use of wheeled vehicles, at least within the Minusinsk basin. If the pre-Bronze Age Afanasiev culture did indeed use wheeled vehicles, one must assume primitive methods of burning and chopping for the fashioning of wheels. The result would necessarily be a relatively stout and crude wheel. Plggott's mapping of the find sites of wheeled vehicles in Europe and the Near East dating to the third and second millennia BC Indicates that the vehicles were found almost exclusively in areas below 900 m. in elevation.27 This suggests that terrain functioned with available technology to constrain the potential dissemination of primitive modes of wheeled transportation. Assuming a date no later than the early second millennium BC for the Znaménka wagon and assuming the accurate depiction of solid construction wheels, one would have to conclude that the Znaménka vehicle would belong to that group of four-wheeled vehicles which would be virtually useless within the high and rugged mountain-rimmed valleys of South Siberia and Mongolia. Within the rough terrain of that region, the smaller and more easily maneuverable two wheeled cart would have been far more practical than the wagon. Among all the images of wheeled vehicles which have hitherto been recorded from the petroglyphs of northeastern Central Asia and South Siberia, none matches that on the Znaménka stone. Okladnlkov has recorded what may be a wagon from the Elangash complex, but It Is pulled by horses and not associated with the images of bovines.2* At Saimaly-Tash in the Tien-shan mountains have been found a number of images which Golendukhin, following Bernshtam , has identified as ploughs of the late third and early second millennia BC.29 He associates their representations with the calendrical celebrations of an agricultural society. Sher has rejected this interpretation, identifying them rather as carts or vehicles, 3° despite the small si28of the "plough," and the manner in which the "driver" stands behind the instrument, using both hands to hold the reins of the horned animals of traction. The long bull-Uke tails of the drivers, as well as</page><page sequence="7">89 their peculiar flying hair , strongly supports the interpretation of a a ritual activity, as Golendukhln has suggested. No plough-like images have been recorded at sites further to the northeast In South Siberia or Mongolia. Given the limited agricultural opportunities of that region, the lack of such images is not surprising. While it is possible to distinguish within the petroglyphlc record between four-wheeled wagons and two-wheeled carts, It is not possible to rely upon the rock -representations of wheel types in order to make an accurate distinction between carts and chariots. Across South Siberia, the wheels of vehicles are represented in a variety of ways: solid, as if of single-piece construction; with four-spokes, as If of cross-bar construction; or with multiple spokes.3' A wheel of single-piece wooden construction would offer heavy but slow transport. One would imagine that vehicles with such wheels would function essentially as heavy- load carts or trolleys, similar to those used in the construction of the Pazyryk barrows.32 Their appearance in the case of a number of images from Chulutyn-gol ( fig. 2/F , 6, 1 ) would indicate that these vehicles were actually heavy carts or that the representations were simply approximate Images.33 Identification of the draft animals confirms this conclusion. In the majority of those instances in which animals are associated with vehicles, the/ can be identified as horses; but in a significant number of other cases, bovines are used, in a vehicle from Elangash stands a man with a mushroom-like hat and with a deer over his head (fig. 2/1); his vehicle is pulled by a horse and bovine which are distinguished particularly by the handling of their tails. 3* The pairing of horses and bovines for traction occurred frequently, at least in the Gorno-Altai region. 35 However , whether the animals used for traction included one or two bovines, the presence of bovines as draft animals precludes the identification of two-wheeled vehicles as chariots. In those cases, one could only have to do with heavier carts. Similar problems of representation and meaning exist in the case of the many images with spoked wheels. Theoretically, the greater the number of spokes Joining the wheel's nave and rim, the lighter the wheel and the faster the vehicle. A wheel spoked by two cross-bars would be lighter than a solid wheel; but the resulting thickness of spokes end rim would allow neither speed nor strength and would thus be inappropriate for either a hunting or war chariot. Kuz'mlna has Identified the pair of two-wheeled vehicles from Arpauzen V In the Karatau ridge of Central Kazakhstan as chariots ( fig. 1 /A), even though their wheels are spoked by two cross-bars.36 Each of the vehicles ts pulled by two stallions ( ?) and In each stands an archer wtth bow readied for shooting at a nearby caprid. There are several nonssQuiturs in these images. A vehicle with</page><page sequence="8">90 four-spoked wheels would have been too slow to be useful either in hunting or in war It is highly unlikely that stallions could be harnessed In pairs (or even Individually) for traction. In the Arpauzen representations there is no indication of reins connecting horses and drivers. Littauer and Crouwel have discussed the skills demanded of the charioteer who functioned simultaneously as a archer. Drawing on examples from the Near East , they conclude that the reins would have had to have been tied at the waist of the archer -charioteer. 37 This mar/ have been a feat that could be used by racing charioteers but it would have been highly impractical in the hunt except in the case of the battue, where the animals would have been driven into the path of the chariot. It was certainly too uncontrolled a manner of driving to have been used in moving rapidly over rough terrain. A similar set of problems pertain in the only other representation with which I am familiar of hunting from a vehicle. Novgorodova has recorded an image from Chulutyn-gol in which an archer "stands" on the platform of a vehicle with two solid wheels and drawn by two bovines.3® Without any signs of reins, the archer shoots at the figure of a large deer of the type known from the Mongolian deer stones (fig. 2/H). An ox-drawn cart with solid wheels would be an unlikely vehicle for a hunt, the success of which would depend on swift movement and rapid maneuverability One must conclude from the Internal inconsistencies of this example and those from Arpauzen that it Is not possible to determine the actual form and function of wheeled vehicles on the basis of their petroglyphic representations. A number of interpretative formulae related to vehicle imagery have been fundamental to the reconstruction of Bronze and ear ly iron Age cultures of Central Asia and South Siberia. Bovines have been routinely Identified as bulls, carts have most often been interpreted as chariots, and bulls and wheeled vehicles have been identified as indicators of a dominating solar worship. The earliest materials to which these interpretative strategies have been applied are the wagon and bovine images on the Znaménka stele (fig. 1 /B). According to Kyzlasov, the cart to the right of the stele's main face is an example of the representation of the cart as sun In Its course through the heavens." Another image of a bovine-drawn cart was recorded by Appel'gren- Klvalo on a now lost stele from Krasnyl kamen'. This Image has also been interpreted as referring to the sun in Its heavenly course.'40 If Kyzlasov Is correct In maintaining that the stele would be</page><page sequence="9">91 pieced in the earth so that their main faces or masks faced to the east, then the Krasnyi kamen' and Znaménka stones create an irreconcilable conflict: on the former, the bull-cart "sun" would be moving to the south, while on the Znaménka stele, the bull-cart "sun" would be moving to the east.4' The consistent Identification of wheeled vehicle images as chariots'42 reflects the equally persistent persuasion that the "chariot" was a sign of the sun and the vehicle of the warrior. The association of wheel or wheeled vehicle with the conceptual construct of chariot/sun/warrior depends in turn upon a number of assumptions regarding Bronze Age culture. These assumptions Include the understanding that the wheeled vehicle entered northeastern Central Asia and South Siberia from a western and proto-lndo-European (PIE) or Indo-European (IE) culture; that in that PIE or IE culture, wheeled vehicles were chariots and a sign of the warrior class and high status; chariots and horses were symbolic of the sun; and the wheel itself was identifiable with the chariot and the sun. A corollary to these assumptions Is that according to which the warrior /charioteer was the most honored member of society. These assumptions will be considered below. The arguments which Join vehicle representations of northeastern Central Asia and South Siberia to a Bronze Age date rely heavily on mater tal from Bronze Age finds in western Central Asia and Europe. Rock-carved representations of vehicles from Europe and Scandinavia offer compelling parallels to the petroglyphic representations from eastern Eurasia.43 These images have been connected with an established tradition of PIE and IE wagon burials from as early as the fourth millennium BC. An even closer connection has been made with the Timber-Grave culture of the second millennium BC.44 The T imber-Grave culture was a western extension of the Andronovo culture of Central Asia. In burial structures and rituals as well as in pottery forms and physical types there is overwhelming evidence for the genetic association of these two cultures.4' A group of burials of the Timber -Grave/Andronovo type have been found near Rimnikski in Chelyabinsk oblast on the east side of the Urals. The burials were in timbered chambers. Five of the burials were furnished with light carts, visible by the negative impression they had left in the soil; the horses had been placed In the grave fill above chambers. These burials have been dated to the mid- second millennium BC.46 Earlier Andronovo burials dating to the seventeenth - sixteenth centuries BC at Slntashta, Berlik, Uliubai, and Satan in northern and central Kazakhstan have yielded the remains of wheeled vehicles or of their imprints.47</page><page sequence="10">92 Ingenerai, Timber-grave andAndronovo wagon burials were associated with male members of society. The size of the kurgāns under which the males were burled and the fact that their burials were accompanied by wheeled vehicles and horses certainly indicates high status. This does not, however, necessarily permit the conclusion that male warriors enjoyed preeminent status within Andronovo society. Within the same Andronovo sites, some women were also accorded burial under large kurgāns, but these burials had been severely plundered. 448 The very fact of the plundering would seem to indicate that such burials must have belonged to individuals of high status who had been buried with valuable grave goods. It is a curious fact that Andronovo vehicle burials have simply received considerably more scholarly attention- -and, one might odd, been accorded greater authority-than have those without vehicles. The question arises whether Interpretations of these wagon burials and of their cultural contexts reflect the reality of the culture in question or our contemporary social privileging of individuals buried with vehicles. The Andronovo finds Indicate that wheeled vehicles were used within the burial rituals of IE cultures which had penetrated deep Into the Kazakhstan steppe; presumably these same cultures used wheeled vehicles in their daily life. Where the trail of actual wagons or carts ends in Kazakhstan, that of their images begin: in the petroglyphs of Karatau ridge, for example, and in those of Salmaly-Tash.4*9 One Is led to the conclusion that the wheeled vehicle had to have been reintroduced into South Siberia during the Andronovo period and out of the Timber- Grave/ Andronovo connection. But the ploughing representations at Saimaly-Tash indicate an earlier knowledge of the use of animal traction, perhaps with wheeled implements, brought from the Near East to eastern Central Asia; and the Znaménka stone strongly suggests that the wheeled vehicle had already been Introduced into South Siberia in the Eneollthlc period. Thus, the Andronovo vehicle represents a réintroduction of wheeled transport and with it the introduction of new cultural values. There Is general agreement that the diffusion of the PIE four wheeled vehicle was associated with the use of the horse for rapid traction and riding and with the use of the wagon for indicating status in burials.50 On the other hand, Littauer and Crouwel have argued that the light war chariot was developed within the Near East as a practical response to the Imperial need for a prestigious vehicle combining speed with maneuverability.5 1 Without trying to determine the exact origins of the wheeled vehicle and of its variations, it is clear that from as early as the third millennium, the chariot was associated with both gods and goddesses throughout the Near East. In second millennium bc Hittite representations of wheeled vehicles and in the appearance of actual</page><page sequence="11">93 vehicles within Mycenae shaft graves, the chariot image seems to have been associated with success in war or In the hunt.52 By the time the Image of the chariot appeared in Central Europe, as In Camonica valley of northern Italy, its image had come to function more as a sign: represented schematically either with or without bovines or horses for traction and frequently accompanied by stick figures of ithyphallic form and raised arms.53 other vehicle representations have been found together with the images of weapons. On at least one anthropomorphic stele from Lagundo, Alto Adige, Switzerland, dated to the third millennium BC. the image of a wagon pulled by two oxen is found in association with the representation of daggers. Such a combination has only served to confirm in the minds of many observers the intimate relationship between wagons or wheeled vehicles and warrlors.54 In petroglyphs of Scandinavia dated to the Bronze Age, the two-wheeled vehicle was represented both with and without animals of traction and dr ivers.55 individual wheel shapes are assumed to refer to the chariot; and both chariot and wheel are frequently understood as referring to a cult of the sun. 56 The famous "sun chariot" of Trundholm has been cited as a primary example of the relationship between wheels, wheeled vehicles, horses, and the sun in northern Europe.5"7 In general , wheels and wheeled vehicles are related to an IE worship of the sun and to the association of sun, sky, and warrior elite. Within these understandings, the distinction between wagons, carts, and chariots has too often been neglected; anything wheeled becomes referred to as a chariot and the resulting chariot is then associated with solar worship and the warrior hero.5* It must certainly be this set of associations, born of a now discredited solarism that lies at the basis of the Interpretation of the vehicle Images of Central Asia and South Slberla.59 Within the IE context there is certainly a close association between the swift chariot, the horse, and the solar deity or hero. The sun god Surya was always associated with a chariot drawn by swift horses. Indeed, of all the Yedlc/Avestan deities, Surya, is most clearly associated with the sun and the golden chariot. His name is said to have derived from svar, light, and to be cognate with the Avestan hvare, sun, "which has swift horses and is the eye of Ahura Mazda." The Avestan Mithra is said to ride before the sun in his bright chariot, but he is not actually identifiable with It.*1 But even within the Yedlc/Avestan texts, the relationship between sun, chariot, and warrior/male Is not absolute; by extension, the exceptions cast doubt on the easy equation between chariot, horse, warrior, and solar god within the South Siberian and Mongolian Bronze Age. For example, Usas, the Dawn, is represented as coming in a chariot (ratha) of light, bringing the luminosity of heaven ( Rig Yeda 1 , 48- 49). 62 Within the Yedlc tradition, chariots and swift</page><page sequence="12">S1* horses are inconsistent indicators of superiority. In demonstrating how in the IE tradition the third function ( the cultivators) could gain supremacy over the first two functions ( priests/kings, warriors/charioteers), Dumézil cites the tale of Mudgale. from Rio Veda X. who took part ina chariot race by using a cart drawn by a single ox and driven not by himself, but by his wife Mudgalani. W In this case, the victor is a woman driving a slow ox-drawn cart. Grottanelli has pointed to a number of instances within IE mythology in which virtuous women driving carts or wagons gain the upper hand over men driving or riding horses.6* Even within the origins of the Scythian tradition, the supposed equation of gold, horse, warrior is not consistent. According to Herodotus, to whom we owe the fullest account of the Scythians, the nomads associated their origins with a golden plough, a golden yoke, a golden battle-axe and a golden cup, all of which fell from heaven. Dumézil has pointed out how in this account the Scythtans were Joined with the implements of the cultivator-plough, cart, oxen--as well as with the cup of the priest and the battle-axe of the warrior. At their very founding, the Scythians were thus identified with the three functions of priest , warrior , and cultivator and not only with the warrior function. W These exceptions suggest that our modern tendency to privilege the warrior aspect of the Scythians says more about the impulses driving theories of culture than about the actuality of that culture. Two major scholars oí the Tlmber-6rave/Andronovo connection, Kuz'mina and Smlrnov, have argued that beginning In the fourteenth century BC the chariot was used as an instrument of war among the Mitanni, Hittites, and Assyrians, and that this tradition established the association of chariots with war-making and with a warrior elite within the Indo-lranian (II) culture carried by the Andronovo across Kazakhstan.66 According to Kuz'mina. the appearance of wheeled vehicles or of thetr substitutes in burials probably indicates the high class of the dead and the fact of class differentiation.67 This association of wheeled vehicles with a warrior elite and with the sign of class differentiation has been fundamental to the arguments used by Kozhin, Novgorodova, and others to establ ish the relationship of vehtcle image to warfare and to a warrior elite. We have seen that absolute ranking distinctions between wagon and non-wagon burtais ma/ actually be In the eyes of the modern beholder rather than embedded In the cultural context itself. Beyond these qualifications, one must assume that within the IE/I I tradition, as within any cultural tradition, signifiers and signlfieds could and would slip from one association to another depending on the changing social and geophysical environment.64 Kozhin has proposed that the wheeled vehicle represented most strikingly as the so-called "Gobi quadriga" (fig 1 /E ) must be compared with the chariots found at Anyang. He makes both the</page><page sequence="13">95 Gobi vehicle and the Shang dynasty chariot contemporaneous with the Karasuk period, that is to the fourteenth - eleventh centuries BC.69 From this he concludes that all Bronze Age wheeled vehicle Images in Central Asia must be associated with the Karasuk culture and must be considered as representing either the advent of an invading culture dependent on the use of a new war vehicle and/or the appearance of trade and trade routes.7® Novgorodova also dates the representation of wheeled vehicles in Mongolia to the early Karasuk, which she places as early as the fifteenth to thirteenth centuries BC. She agrees with Kozhln that the wide-spread diffusion of the vehicle image represented the advantages of a new battle vehicle.7 1 On the basis of the Mongol tan representations of wheeled vehicles and with reference to the image group from Chulutyn-gol representing a horse-drawn two- wheeled vehicle, a driver , and a snake-like element (flg. 2/F), Novgorodova suggests the relationship of the chariot image to a hero-warrior. The vehicle thus also functioned, she has argued, as a sign of the emergence of the heroic epic tradition of South Siberia. In those two instances where deer with large antlers appear near a chariot or its driver , she proposes that the deer should be understood as the warrior's totem ic protectors.72 The arguments which associate wheeled vehicles and specifically "chariots" with a warrior class assume a close analogy between the function and symbolic load of the vehicle in eastern Eurasia and the association of the wheeled vehicle with a warrior class within IE/11 traditions. We have seen that within the IE tradition the identification of wagons only with warriors is incorrect. Wagons seem also to have been associated with women and in particular with exemplary women. One finds, also, a sufficiently varying set of associated images to indicate that cultural values and symbolic meaning must have shifted as traditions moved into new environments. While In Central Europe the Image of the wheeled vehicle was sometimes associated with the representation of weapons, the vehicle cannot be conceived as a war chariot: in fact, it is usually not a chariot at all , but rather a slow four-wheeled wagon, often drawn by bovines.73 In petroglyphs from Bohuslan , the vehicle Is sometimes drawn by a deer , an unlikely animal for a war chariot.7* At other times, it is simply without an animal of traction. This variation in animals of traction - horses, bovines, or even deer-- or their complete absence is repeated, as we have seen, in the case of the South Siberian and Mongolian imagery. If one were to assume that the wagon or cart or chariot was a sign of the warrior , then one would also have to conclude that the vehicle without Its animal of traction was sufficient in itself to refer to the warrior caste. But whether In the case of European petroglyphs or in the case of those from Central Asia and South Siberia, or even in the contrast between wagons used in IE burials and chariots used by</page><page sequence="14">96 Near Eastern royalty, one is forced to 8sk what it is, exactly, that should be associated with the warrior: the slow wagon, the rough cart, or the chariot; the vehicle drawn by oxen, by horses, by deer or by nothing at all? And which kind of vehicle is actually represented in the Central Asian and South Siberian petroglyphs? We have seen that the images as often as not indicate the solid- wheel construction of a slow cart rather than the light and multi-spoked wheel construction of a chariot. Such a vehicle is commensurate with the need to transport goods and people across extensive space. The maneuverability of such a vehicle Is also appropriate to a landscape characterized by rough mountainous terrain, narrow high valleys and passes, and by the broad grasslands of northern Mongolia. Sturdy two-wheeled carts and slower , less maneuverable four- wheeled wagons are still visible all over Mongolia today; they were the mode of choice for transporting goods and people In the days of the Mongol empire and were used even earlier, according to Herodotus, by the Scythians. On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine the usefulness of a chariot In the terramof the Gorno-Altai, Tuva, or northwestern Mongolia. The land there Is entirely too high in elevation and too rough In surface to permit the passage of a vehicle of prestige developed In the context of a Near Eastern urbanized society or one that was used successfully in warfare on China's broad Central Plain. The narrowness of the valleys of the Chuia and Elangash rivers, where occur so many of the images of wheeled vehicles, and the manner In which these valleys are bordered by steep rugged slopes, Indicate the futility of a chariot-based warfare or even of a chariot-based hunt. In either case, the enemy or the hunted animals could quickly find shelter on a higher terrace, inaccessible to a chariot, or they could rapidly disappear into one of the constant defiles bordering the brooder valley. In the meantime, the pursuing wooden chariot would have fallen to pieces, unable to absorb the vibrations created when a light two-wheeled vehicle is pulled rapidly over rough terrain. The conclusion that the vehicle Imagery of South Siberia and Mongolia indicates the intrusion of a warlike society and the presence of a warrior class is further challenged by a number of other considerations, all drawn from the petroglyphlc record Itself. In Central Europe, the association of vehicle and warr lor is suggested, as has been said, by the occasional representation of weapons together with wheeled vehicles. By contrast, in northeastern Central Asia and South Siberia there are no representations of weapons of either Karasuk or any other culture found in association with the images of wheeled vehicles. If one is to Insist on the vehicle</page><page sequence="15">97 as a warrior signifier than it would have to be admitted that in the process of transmission from western Siberia and Kazakhstan Into South Siberia and Mongolia, an important part of the signifying complex- -the weapons of the warrior- -was dropped out. But this would be to admit that imagery and the symbolic load it carries does Indeed change with environment and time; and that however similar the wagons and carts carved into the rocks of Central Europe and Central Asia, apparent similarity does not support an argument of identity of substance or of signification. It has been noted that Kozhin and Novgorodova associate the appearance of the vehicle image, and thus of the "chariot" Itself, with the Karasuk culture. In contrast to the westward extending Andronovo cultui e, the Karasuk culture is believed to have been formed out of elements indigenous to Siberia.7' The people of the Karasuk culture would either have had to reinvent the wheeled vehicle independently - an unlikely circumstance, which no one has tried to argue - or they would have had to have received it from such southern neighbors as the Chinese or from western neighbors such as the Andronovo. There is no archaeological evidence to Indicate that the wheeled vehicle of Shang China could have been indigenously developed; In Its Anyang date and in the lack of evldencs of more primitive forms, it could only have been received from outside. The one remaining source for the réintroduction of the wheeled vehicle and by far the most convincing Is the Andronovo culture, with its westward extension Into the T imber-grave culture. But there are other elements which challenge the theory that the dissemination of the wheeled vehicle7* was specifically associated with the expansion of the Karasuk culture. In terms of sheer number of representations, the diffusion of the wheeled vehicle image seems to have passed from the region of eastern Kazakhstan and the Gorno-Altai Into Mongolia and present-day Inner Mongolia. There are very few representations of wheeled vehicles preserved In the Minusinsk basin, the region wherein first clearly emerged the Karasuk culture. Moreover, while the Mongolian deer stones have been convincingly associated with the Karasuk period on the basis of weapon typologies represented on the stones,77 there is only one deer stone on which has been found the representation of a wheeled vehicle.7® There is only one instance of a vehicle associated with the deer image of the type found on the Mongolian deer stones ( fig. 2/H). In that case, from Chulutyn-gol , it is possible that the large deer is a later "addition" to the much smaller representation of cart and hunter /driver.7* If as Volkov has persuasively argued the deer stones can be dated to the late Brorce Age, i.e. approximately 1000 BC and later, then it would seem necessary to place the image of the wheeled vehicle earlier than that date, associated with Andronovo though within the Andronovo- Karasuk chronological horizon.</page><page sequence="16">98 In the Karatau ridge at Kolbagara in south-central Kazakhstan, Kadyrbaev and Mar'iashev recorded 22 images of "chariots," while at Arpauzen they found 1 6. Several instances from both sites are of four-wheeled vehicles, pulled by camel. The majority, however , are two-wheeled, usually pulled by two or four oxen or horses or represented without harnessed animals.*0 We have seen that images of vehicles (as well as of ploughs) are known from Salmaly-Tash and Tamgaly. A large number of wheeled vehicles have been recorded among the petroglyphs of south- eastern Gorno-Altai and of western and central Mongolia. In addition, a few images have been found in Tuva, at Mugur-Sargol, and in Inner Mongolia, in the Yinshan mountains. Representations of mushroom -hatted figures can be found In all the same regions except those of southeastern Kazakhstan. The similarity in geographic distribution of the mushroom -hatted figures end of wheeled vehicle imagery would suggest that within the regional arena Including Mongolia, these two pictorial elements referred back to the same cultural context. The actual connection is not, however, completely clear. Within the Elangash complex of Gorno-Altai, two-wheeled vehicles may possibly be associated with the mushroom-hatted figures. At Sary-Sartak , a figure with what may be a mushroom-shaped hat "stands" on the axle of a two-wheeled vehicle drawn by a bovine and a horse.*1 From Chankyr-Kella comes a more certain image of a mushroom -hatted figure. He leads two horses and seems to be approaching a two-wheeled cart, as if to harness the animals ( fig. 2/N). But the relationship here of horses to vehicle is not certain. Because I can cite no other representations in which a figure appears to be harnessing animals to a vehicle, there is no way of confirming either relationship or meaning here. From Mongolia comes only one known representation in which a mushroom -hatted figure seems to be associated with a wheeled vehicle. This is the image from Chulutyn-gol including a hatted figure "on" the platform between two solid wheels, two horses, and a mark suggesting a large serpent (flg. 2/F).*2 Among all the other Images of both mushroom -hatted figures and wheeled vehicles known to me, from Kazakhstan through the Gorno-Altai , Tuva, and Mongolia, there are thus only three instances in which the two elements may actually be connected and only one - that from Chulutyn-gol- -where the connection seems certain. One ma/ only conclude that if Indeed the two pictorial elements belonged to the same cultural stratum , they were not necessarily associated. Just as two-wheeled vehicles were probably neither chariots nor sun symbols, so the hatted figures were not warriors.</page><page sequence="17">99 An overview of Bronze Age representations of wheeled vehicles and their associated imagery in Mongolia, Gorno-Altai, Tuva, and the Minusinsk basin offers the most telling argument against the widely held theory that during the second millennium bc there was an aggressive intrusion into that region of a new warrior-led culture. Both the petroglyphic record and its association with the archaeology of the Eneolithic and Bronze Age suggest that during the second millennium BC there was rather a gradual infiltration of peoples from the west and southwest into northern Kazakhstan, the Gorno-Altai , and Mongolia. These people had Inherited the IE traditions of the Timber-Grave/Andronovo cultures but they had also inherited elements from the ancient Near Eastern traditions which preceded the IE overlay but persisted within the agricultural oases of Central Asia.*3 In other words, the Bronze Age cultures reflected in the Karatau, Saimaly- Tash, and Tamgaly petroglyphic complexes were not purely IE and cannot be fathomed by using only the tools of a simplified IE mythic tradition. We must assume that as the Andronovo peoples pushed on into South Siberia, their customs and beliefs met, confronted, and were reshaped by the customs and beliefs of the autochthonous populations. The climatic rigors and rugged landscape of South Siberia and Mongolia had to have constrained mythic traditions which had arisen far to the west and south. The very process of penetrating into the Minusinsk basin, of settling in a land which opened to the taiga and tundra on the north, must have forced onto the imagination of the newcomers belief systems shaped by landscape, by weather , by native plants and animals, and by new economic realities. Physical and cultural survival must have insisted on accommodation and change. Among the Bronze Age image groups from northeastern Central Asia and South Siberia which are Indicative of Interaction, almost all emphasize ritual, the hunt (which may also be ritual), and interaction relating to wheeled vehicles. Within this group of petroglyphs there is almost no basis for attributing a warlike nature to contemporary cultures, nor is there any Indication of a value placed on either individual human combat or on war. Indeed, the vast majority of the scenes eschew violence and the hunting scenes are striking by their lack of violence: figures and animals are balanced In size and number to suggest a balance in actuality. There is no indication that the mushroom -hatted figures functioned more frequently as hunters thon did any other kind of figure, nor does the petroglyphic evidence allow the conclusion that they were warriors. While war, combat, and plunder may well have been part of cultural life, within</page><page sequence="18">1 00 the petroglyphic record we find no validation of these activities. The catalogued imagery indicates that not war but rather the hunt for meet, the ritual hunt, the ritual dance, and sacrifice seem to have been valued above all other activities. Even without a driver, the vehicle seems to hove had a particular but unclear significance for the culture that image represents. In the vast majority of cases, the wheeled vehicle is drawn by only two animals, usually horses but often bovines. The general aspect of all the representations of wheeled vehicles is that of vehicles used for practical, everyday purposes rather than for military purposes. At a number of sites, the vehicles are represented as driving in all directions or to be facing in all directions^'4 ; the very arbitrariness of that directionality seriously undercuts the other assumption that the vehicle referred to the sun in its course through the heavens. Moreover, the appearance of the cart alone indicates that it in itself was valued, without any necessary reference to warriors or horses. There are no texts to indicate how the vehicles functioned In the life of Bronze Age peoples of South Siberia and Mongolia. On the other hand, in the accounts of Western visitors to the courts of the great khans we do have some information about the significance of the cart within everyday Mongol life. The Mongols' carts were apparently basic to the furnishings of a household, small enough to carry the personal chests prized by women or large enough to carry their large felt dwellings. The latter could require up to 22 oxen in a team. According to Friar William of Rubruck (journeyed 1 253- 1 255), such a cart would require an axle as large as the mast of a ship.*' William's account Is Interesting for the light It sheds on the use and significance of the carts. He Indicates that the carts were Intimately associated with a sense of community. The "Tartars" would carry their houses on their carts and whenever they stopped to make camp the/ placed the carts with their chests still on them "here and there, within half a stone's throw of the house: so that the house stands between two ranks of carts, as it were, between two walls." The carts carrying the family wealth seem to have been associated particularly with women: they carried the women's personal chests, often carved with great refinement; the women, according to William, made themselves "most beautiful carts," a rich man with many wives thus having many carts for all his women. "One woman will guide twenty or thirty carts at onœ ... and they bind the carts with camels or oxen, one behind another. ..They go at a slow pace, as fast as a lamb or an ox might walk."®6 William says that the duties of women included, among others, driving the carts, laying their houses upon the carts and taking them down again.87 Such elaborate carts and cart</page><page sequence="19">101 trains have disappeared from everyday life. In present times one sees most frequently horse drawn carts mounted with two or four wheels and drawn by one or two horses. Granting the great difference in time between the petroglyphs of the Bronze Age and the Mongolian practices observed by William of Rubruck in the thirteenth century, one may still possibly find in the latter an explanation for the former. Rather than referring to hunters or warriors or even to the aggressive invasion of a foreign culture, the Bronze Age petroglyphs of wheeled vehicles may simply refer to the presence of a new culture in terms of the signs of its understanding of wealth. With or without animals of traction, the cart may have functioned as a cultural sign of well-being; It may have referred to community as a source of identity and to the presence of that community in a new region. It is entirely possible that that cultural intrusion was identical with the intrusion of the Andronovo culture into South Siberia and with its merging with the contemporary Karasuk culture of the Minusinsk basin and northern Mongolia. But if we are to take the petroglyphs seriously, then we must admit the possibility that as that culture penetrated Into the physical and cultural environment of South Siberia, its IE mythic traditions and the values carried by its more western cultural artifacts were constrained and reshaped by new conditions of survival and by Siberian systems of belief. However the image of the vehicle functioned within IE traditions, It seems to have ended Its travels in eastern Eurasia with a cultural load radically different from that with which It was laden in Eastern Europe. Having possibly begun as a mark of social rank and perhaps as the sign of the warrior , it ended its eastward penetration as a sign of a cultural presence and as the mark of community. Like the Images of rltually dressed figures In ritual ceremonies, the images of vehicles carved onto the cliffs and boulders of South Siberia and Central Asia traœ the gradual infiltration of one culture into a hitherto unknown territory. These images reflect neither warriors nor solar worship nor even the emergence of a dominant warrior caste but rather community as identity, the cart as a sign of household well-being, and the community reaffirmed by ritual ceremonies.</page><page sequence="20">1 02 Appendix: Analysis of 212 Image Groups This study Is based upon a group of 2 1 2 Images from major petroglyphlc sites In Gorno- Altai, Tuva, and Mongolia. The images were derived from an analysis of all published materials available to me at this time and of materials recorded personally in the field. The stud/ group is obviously not comprehensive but It 1s exemplary of patterns of representation found throughout this region of Central Asia and South Siberia. This group does not include petroglyphs from Inner Mongolia, the Transbaikal, or Kazakhstan, nor does it presently include a number of smaller sites, such os Delger-Muren, in the Tes river valley. (See text for references to specific sources.) Of the 1 1 3 representations of human figures and animals considered, In only two cases was there represented the prédation of animal on human and those two are beside each other on the same rxk (Chuia river valley; personal observation). Of the 1 11 remaining groups, 54 represent ritual or real hunts while 57 Indicate figures and animals in either ritual or domestic setting. By contrast, within this sample group of Images there are only 8 representations of humans fighting each other , and up to 6 of those may in fact be ritual scenes rather than scenes of actual battle. In the case of the 74 representations of wheeled vehicles, not one represents anything having to do with battle or combat. In only one ( I ) case is there represented hunting from a vehicle. No less striking is the fact that of those 74 representations, 24 lack a driver and another 1 4 lack animals or driver. There are no instances of a dr iver in a vehicle without animals.
