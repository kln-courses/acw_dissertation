This volume in the National Gallery of Art's Studies in the History of Art series contains the proceedings of the symposium of 27-28 May 1988, held in conjunction with the traveling exhibition "The Human Figure in Early Greek Art" on view at the National Gallery from 31 January-12 June 1988. A catalogue with a number of short essays and fine color photographs appeared contemporaneously with the exhibition. Diana Buitron-Oliver has done an exemplary job in curating and coordinating this event and producing the published results in good time. Although the National Gal- lery has few holdings in ancient art, three of the symposia sponsored by the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts have had an ancient theme. Four centuries of pre-Classical art were highlighted in the exhibition, and the range of "new perspectives" spans the four centuries and more, several disciplines (literature, lin- guistics, all media of art, iconography, and archaeology) and all degrees of length and approach. The 16 contributors took the charge of responding to the provocative assembly of objects rather differently. Surprisingly few used the ex- hibited objects in their papers. Some chose to target the "general" component of the original audience (A. Boege- hold, "Archaic Greece: An Era of Discovery"; M. Lang, "The Alphabetic Impact on Archaic Greece"). Others took a re- flective approach without all the apparatus of modern schol- arly discourse, engaging broad themes on which they wrote thoughtful but ultimately inconclusive excursions (0. Mur- ray, "The Social Function of Art in Early Greece"; W. Burk- ert, "Homer's Anthropomorphism: Narrative and Ritual"). E. Touloupa ("Early Bronze Sheets with Figured Scenes from the Acropolis") publishes for the first time some bronze fittings found on the Acropolis that have since made their way to the National Archaeological Museum. Still others presented papers that might have appeared in scholarly journals (J. Hurwit, "The Representation of Nature in Early Greek Art"; H.A. Shapiro, "Theseus: Aspects of the Hero in Archaic Greece"). R. Nicholls ("Early Monumental Reli- gious Architecture at Old Smyrna") previews his publication of the Archaic Athena temples at Smyrna. B. Knox, E. Vermeule, B.C. Dietrich, V. Lambrinoudakis, O. Tzahou- Alexandri, and M. Oeconomides also contributed. Two pa- pers of unusual interest may be singled out. Evelyn Harrison's "The Dress of the Archaic Greek Korai" takes another look at an old subject. (For a different per- spective on clothes from the more technical point of view of a historian of textiles and a practitioner of the art of weaving, see now E.J.W. Barber, Prehistoric Textiles: The Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages [Princeton 1991] esp. pp. 360ff., on figured cloth in Archaic and Classical dress.) Reaching back to the Bronze Age, the author con- fronts many familiar images, discovering aspects of female dress that we had not noticed before and reassessing old</page><page sequence="2">1994] BOOK REVIEWS 169 evidence, visual and literary. The korai from the Acropolis are her goal and, on these, Harrison has new and important things to say. Age may be indicated in the korai by differ- entiation according to dress; for example, girls who wear only the chiton may be younger than those who wear some version of the chiton/himation combination (p. 234). While Harrison does not directly address the vexed question of whom the korai represent (on which, see B. Ridgway, AJA 94 [1990] 583-612), it is striking that her remarks seem to indicate that she is now more inclined to regard them as mortals than she was in the 1988 catalogue to this exhibition. She speaks of korai 684 and 685 (in the exhibition) as if they were individuals, preferring to quote others about 684's "physical ripeness" and "mature sensibility," her combination of "solemnity and sweetness," and the facts that she seems naked though she is not, and "secret" though she stands bold and unsmiling before us (p. 236). Harrison's cautious characterization of these korai as having individualizing traits seems to indicate that the issue of the precise identities of all of the korai from the Acropolis is still open and might repay continued investigation. Dyfri Williams's "The Drawing of the Human Figure on Early Red-Figure Vases" is, as I remembered, a model of formal analysis, and a reminder, once again, that what is easy to see (once someone else points it out) can be difficult to put into words. Williams returns to a theme that he has taken up elsewhere (T. Rasmussen and N. Spivey eds., Look- ing at Greek Vases, Cambridge 1991), that is, the develop- mental history of two-dimensional representations on vases of the nude male figure during the transitional period from Archaic to Classical-a "revolution" that is turning out to be longer than anyone thought. He is the only participant to take the "new perspectives" challenge in a literal way: A fragment of a cup by Psiax showing an archer whose right leg is violently foreshortened taken from Williams's paper was selected as the dust jacket illustration. Williams's center- piece is the Antiphon Painter's invention of what he aptly calls the "open-plan" torso, the tangible results of a "personal quest for a new chest form" whose primary effect was to allow vase painters (possibly independent of free painters) to depict the male figure in convincing and optically correct torsion. Williams's distinctive manner of describing vase paintings is, while his contextual approach is quite different, reminiscent of Rhys Carpenter's detailed descriptions of formal developments in Greek sculpture. One misses in this collection more conscious attention to the Orientalizing influx that affected Greek art and society from the Bronze Age to ca. 480 B.C. (See now Burkert, translated and revised, The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Archaic Age, Cam- bridge, Mass., 1992.) A maelstrom of ideas, forms, and influences, from centuries before and distant places, the Greek Archaic period becomes less extraordinary, less orig- inal, and less autonomous the more we learn to acknowledge what is Oriental about it-an acknowledgment that makes the Greek revolution in E.H. Gombrich's terms all the more remarkable. Harrison reminds us of Payne's evocations of the latent refinement of the Peplos Kore, once mistaken for a shapeless xoanon. The "subtle modulations of the decep- tively simple surfaces" and the "feeling for the complemen- tary rather than opposing roles of body and drapery" (p. 234) are the only real symptoms at this date that some- thing unprecedently Greek was in store for the human fig- ure.
