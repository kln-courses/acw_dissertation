REYNOLDS III bennie.reynolds@millsaps.edu Millsaps College, Jackson, MS 39210 The Hebrew expression ביד רמה ("with an uplifted hand") is used in the Hebrew Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls to convey defiance and arrogance. It is also used to qualify intent with respect to sin. This essay examines how data from the Qumran library significantly enhance our knowledge about how the expression was used in ancient Judaism. Special emphasis is placed on how a rare meaning found in the book of Numbers was used to shape religious law in many of the sectarian texts found at Qumran. Essene writers would not have made distinc tions between what modern scholars label as Priestly and Holiness source mate rials in pentateuchal books, but modern literary analysis of the Pentateuch can shed light on how and why certain texts had the particular influences that they did in history. This paper suggests that the legal/literary innovations of the post exilic Holiness School ultimately played a role in the later development of Essene/ sectarian constructions of Jewish identity. Literary and linguistic analyses can provide a partial genealogy of sin between the Holiness School and the Essenes. The Holiness School's extension of the concept of holiness from the collective to the individual made it possible for the Essenes to develop a unique notion of Jewish identity that tied the Torah faithfulness of various types of individuals to their community status. The Hebrew expression ביד רמה ("with an uplifted hand") is used in the Hebrew Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls to convey defiance and arrogance. It is also used to qualify intent with respect to sin. It seems likely that we possess numerous pieces of ancient Near Eastern art that depict the gesture and related emotional expression described by 1.ביד רמה One suspects that precisely the same gesture that gave rise 1 The god Bacal is depicted "with an uplifted hand" in both statuettes and stelae; see Olivier Binst, The Levant: History and Archaeology in the Eastern Mediterranean (Cologne: Konemann, 1999), 42, 50.

Indeed, a recent study indicates that the upraised arm is a biologically innate nonverbal display of pride in humans.2 This essay examines how data from the Qumran library significantly enhance our knowledge about how the expression was used in ancient Judaism. I place special emphasis on how a rare meaning found in the Hebrew Bible was used to shape religious law in many of the sectarian texts found at Qumran. This essay consists of two main parts. First, I examine how the expression ביד רמה is used in the Hebrew Bible. Next, I compare those usages to the ones found in the texts from the Qumran library—a significantly larger repository of examples. Special attention is devoted to the role of literary genre (e.g., is an example found in legislation or prose narrative?) and source (e.g., is the text Essene or non-Essene, P or H, etc.?).31 argue that two distinct meanings are found in both the Hebrew Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls. Among the Dead Sea Scrolls, the expression can function as a specialized, legal term. This technical term is not found in the Hebrew Bible, but I argue that it develops from a single passage in the Hebrew Bible. Twenty-two years ago, Elisha Qimron included the expression ביד רמה in a brief study of the technical vocabulary for inadvertent and intentional sin in ancient Hebrew.4 He concluded that the expression ביד רמה was a technical term for inten tional sin in the Dead Sea Scrolls and probably also in the Hebrew Bible.5 Qimrons From Mesopotamia, examples would probably include the pair of protective spirits depicted in a relief from seventh-century Nineveh (British Museum WA 118932). Other reliefs from Nineveh depict victorious soldiers with an uplifted hand (sometimes holding the head of slain opponents!). See, e.g., British Museum WA 124786-7. One might also add the ninth-century relief from the temple of Ninurta at Nimrud in which the deity pursues a monster with a thunderbolt in his uplifted hand (British Museum ANE 134571-3). The god would seem to be Ninurta, but the scene may be a transmogrification of the battle between Marduk and Tiamat. 2Jessica Tracy and David Matsumoto, "The Spontaneous Expression of Pride and Shame: Evidence for Biologically Innate Nonverbal Displays," in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Sciences of the United States of America 105/33 (2008): 11655-60. 3I stipulate that these categories are problematic. At the very least, however, they provide a set of placeholders that help us organize the real and sometimes significant literary problems in the texts. 4Qimron,4Qimron, "על שגגות וזדונות במגילות מדבר יהודה עיון במונחים המשמשים לציונם," in Proceedings Proceedings of the 10th World Congress of Jewish Studies (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1990), 103-10. 5Ibid., 106-7. Qimron shows, for example, how ביד רמה is sometimes presented in contrast to שגגה (inadvertent sin) in the same passage in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Biblical evidence is outside the scope of his article (the aforementioned linguistic contrast is made only in Numbers 15 in the Hebrew Bible). Qimrons paper is a brief but comprehensive treatment of the terminology concerning sin in the Dead Sea Scrolls. I do not find his assessment incorrect, only preliminary. For an English-language survey of the language of sin the Dead Sea Scrolls, see Gary Anderson, "Intentional and Unintentional Sin in the Dead Sea Scrolls," in Pomegranates and Golden Bells: Studies Studies in Biblical, Jewish, and Near Eastern Ritual, Law, and Literature in Honor of Jacob Milgrom (ed. David Wright et al.; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1995), 49-64. Anderson updates Qimrons</page><page sequence="3">Reynolds:Reynolds: The Expression ביד רמה in the Hebrew Bible and the DSS 587 position can now be updated in light of a larger pool of evidence. The expression is used in more than one way in both the Hebrew Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls, but its rare attestation in legal contexts from the Hebrew Bible makes it difficult to argue for technical connotations there.6 Moreover, while ביד רמה is used as a tech nical term in the Dead Sea Scrolls, that meaning is demanded only in specific contexts. Nonlegal texts use the term more broadly. I. Hebrew Bible The expression ביד רמה is used only three times in the Hebrew Bible, but there is some discord among the biblical writers about the relative virtue or vice of being a person ביד רמה, "with an upraised hand." A small unit of P material in Exod 14:8 uses the phrase positively when describing the Israelite flight from Egypt: "And Yhwh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; but the children of Israel went out with an upraised hand (7".(ביד רמה The translation of this passage in Targum Onqelos emphasizes the arrogance and trium phalism expressed in the Exodus text: נפקו בריש גלי, "they went out bare-headed."8 In a similar passage that may have been produced by the same persons paper by adding several newly published texts to the data sets for each term (both Anderson and Qimron deal with many more terms than I attempt to do here). He also makes more explicit connections with biblical texts (see the discussion of Num 15:30 below), though he does not address explicitly the question of whether ביד רמה functions as a technical term in the Hebrew Bible. Ultimately, he adopts and extends Qimrorïs distinctions between intentional and unintentional sin, on the one hand, and revealed and hidden law, on the other, in order to high light the legal dimensions of Torah obedience according to the writers of several scrolls. 6See Baruch A. Levine, Numbers 1-20: A New Translation with Introduction and Com mentarymentary (AB 4A; New York: Doubleday, 1993), 395. 7All translations are mine unless otherwise indicated. The vast majority of interpreters would assign this verse (or most of it) to P. The general distinction is that JE (or, non-P) provides the account of the hurried exit while P is more triumphalistic. A specific example of this theory can be found in, for example, the doublets in 13:17-18a/14:l-4,14:8-9. See William H. C. Propp, Exodus Exodus 1-18: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary ( AB 2; New York: Doubleday, 1998), 461-62, 484. See also Brevard S. Childs, The Book of Exodus: A Critical, Theological Commentary Commentary (OTL; Louisville: Westminster, 1976), 218-21; Thomas B. Dozeman, Commentary on on Exodus (Eerdmans Critical Commentary; Grand Rapids Eerdmans, 2009), 311-13. It is noteworthy that most commentators see this verse as Ps editorial addition to existing non-P material. We shall see below that a different priestly editor may be responsible for further trans formations. 8Alexander Sperber, The Bible in Aramaic: Based on Old Manuscripts and Printed Texts, vol. 1, The Pentateuch according to Targum Onkelos (Leiden: Brill, 1992), 112.1 agree with Propp that "bare-headed" probably indicates disrespect and is related to the Jewish custom of covering the head in prayer (current at the time of Onqelos, not during the putative time of the exodus). See Propp, Exodus 1-18, 493.</page><page sequence="4">588 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 3 (2013) responsible for editing Exod 14:8 (P), Num 33:3 reports, "And they set out from Rameses during the first month; the fifteenth day of the first month. On the day after the Passover the children of Israel went with an uplifted hand [ביד רמה] before the eyes of all the Egyptians."9 Both Exod 14:8 and Num 33:3 use the expression "with an uplifted hand" in a positive sense. Each indicates a sort of righteous defi ance. These examples make the final biblical reference in Num 15:30 all the more striking: "But the person who acts with an uplifted hand [ביד רמה], whether a native or a sojourner, he blasphemes Yhwh. That person shall be cut off from the midst of the people." The expression והנפש אשר־תעשה ביד רמה in Num 15:30 should probably be rendered, "But the person who sins intentionally," since it represents a contrast with הנפש השגגת בחטאה בשגגה, "the person who sins, when he sins unintentionally," in 15:28. Several similar expressions from the Hebrew Bible, how ever, indicate that the use of ביד רמה in Num 15:30 and the meaning "intentional sin" are anomalous in the Hebrew Bible. It is not a technical term here. 1 Kings 11:26-27 details why Jeroboam rebelled against Solomon and uses the following words to characterize the rebellion: "he lifted a hand against the king" (וירם יד במלך). In this verse, the root רמה is used as a verb instead of an adjective, and it conveys defiance and/or rebellion. Similarly, the arrogance or hubris of the wicked is described in Job 35:18 as an "uplifted arm" (זרוע רמה). In the Song of Moses (Deut 31:30-32:43), Yhwh refuses to destroy Israel completely—not because they deserve clemency but in order to foil the triumphalism of Israel's enemies: "Lest their enemy say, 'we are triumphant' [ידינו רמה]; it was not Yhwh who did this" (Deut 32:27). While Deuteronomy presents a different context than 1 Kings, the basic meaning seems to be the same as the meaning of ביד רמה in Exod 14:8 and Num 33:3: an expression of arrogance or defiance. One finds in Isa 26:11; Ps 89:43; and Mic 5:8 articulations of the notion of "victory" with still similar terminology. In the first text, the prophet claims, "Your hand shall be lifted up [תרם ידך] and your enemies shall be cut off" (Mic 5:8). Psalm 89:4 also emphasizes the concept of power: לך זרוע עם־גבורה תעז ידך תרום ימינך, "You have a mighty hand, strong is your hand, your right hand uplifted." Psalm 118:16 communicates both victory and power: ימין יהוה רוממה ימין יהוה עשה חיל, "The right hand of Yhwh is uplifted, the right hand of Yhwh exerts strength." Finally, Deut 26:8 invokes the exodus tradition and implies defiance, power, and victory in its use of the phrase ביד חזקה, "with a mighty hand." It is interesting that all examples involving collective Israel or Yhwh as the subject are positive examples. All examples involving others are negative.10 Thus, the relative virtue or vice of being a person or group "with an uplifted hand" is 9Few would disagree that the passage in question is priestly, and many make more or less direct connections with Exodus. See Baruch A. Levine, Numbers 21-36: A New Translation with Introduction Introduction and Commentary (AB 4A; New York: Doubleday, 2000), 515-16. See also Dozeman, Exodus,Exodus, 313. 10One might argue that 1 Kgs 11:26-27 forms an exception, since Jeroboam is an Israelite,</page><page sequence="5">Reynolds:Reynolds: The Expression ביד רמה in the Hebrew Bible and the DSS 589 entirely a dependent on the writers predisposition toward that person or group. In the Hebrew Bible, the expression ביד רמה is itself neutral and contains no inherent positive or negative nuances. The exception to this rule is found in Num 15:30, where both natives and sojourners are forbidden to do anything "with an uplifted hand." There could be no positive nuance or flipside to the use of ביד רמה in Num 15:30. Its meaning is spe cifically conditioned by the expression in 15:28: הנפש השגגת בחטאה בשגגה, "the person who sins, when he sins unintentionally." It is therefore significant that the examples of the expression ביד רמה from the Qumran library overwhelmingly reflect Num 15:30, the meaning that is rare in the Hebrew Bible.11 Consequently, a few more words are in order about the context of Num 15:30. In what follows, I attempt to outline the potential provenance of Num 15:22-31 within the Holiness School. If correct, this provenance helps to explain the historical accidents by which some Essene writers developed their distinctive notions of Jewish identity. More specifically, I argue that the way in which the Holiness Writer/Redactor extends legal/theological concepts such as sin from the collective to the individual sets the stage for Essene notions of individual sin and its implications for community status. Martin Noth described the Numbers 15 as "various appendices of a cultic ritual nature."12 Within that disparate material, w. 22-31 deal with atonement for various categories of sins, taking care to specify that there should be no distinction between native and sojourner. Aryeh Toeg, followed by Michael Fishbane, contends that that w. 22-31 are a "Halachic Midrash" on Lev 4:14.13 Placing Num 15:22-31 after Lev 4:14 has significant implications in light of current theories about the compo sition of the Pentateuch. Most specialists now accept the following relative chronol ogy for the major legal collections of the Pentateuch: (1) Covenant Code (Exod 20:22-23:19/33), (2) Deuteronomic Code (Deuteronomy 12-26; 28), (3) Holiness Code (Leviticus 17-26).14 The place of the Holiness Code is of crucial interest here. but in the context of his rebellion against Solomon, he is almost certainly an enemy of Israel from the perspective of the Deuteronomistic Historian. 11Gary Anderson has already called attention to the centrality of Num 15:22-30 for understanding the conception of sin at Qumran, and I agree with him that "the Dead Sea sect took this legal hapax and transformed it into a common idiom" ( "Intentional and Unintentional Sin," 52-54). 12Noth, Numbers (OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968), 112. Levines summary is similar: "Unfinished Cultic Business" (Numbers 1-20, 383). 13Toeg, "A Halachic Midrash in Numbers 15.22-31" (in Hebrew), Tarbiz 43 (1973-74): 1-20; Fishbane, Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985), 223-24.

Carol L. Meyers and M. O'Connor; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1983), 211-15. Levine concurs, although he sees a wider influence from Leviticus and holds that Num 15:22-31 was modeled after Leviticus 4-5 (Numbers 1-20, 395-98). 14For a concise overview, see Jean-Louis Ska, Introduction to Reading the Pentateuch</page><page sequence="6">590 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 3 (2013) Since the nineteenth century, scholars have viewed Leviticus 17-26 as a distinct literary unit that predates the Priestly writer.15 Since the 1980s, however, several major studies have posited a variety of theses on how H (a Holiness redactor/school) actually edited and completed the work of P.16 The implication for our Numbers 15 text in light of the work of Toeg and Fishbane is that it might not belong to P at all, but to H. Julius Wellhausen already signaled as much in 1889: "Kapital 15 (an Mose) scheint von dem Bearbeiteter (nicht von dem Autor) der Sammlung Lev. 17-26 verfasst, denn es finden sich bemerkenswerte Reminiscenzen und Âhnlichkeiten."17 In recent times Israel Knohl has argued for assigning (parts of) Numbers 15 to H. In his judgment, the H writer of Num 15:22-31 is (obviously) aware of Levit icus 4, but Numbers 15 is probably not an exegetical elaboration of the Leviticus (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2006), 40-52. The relative chronology still hinges on Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wettes Dissertatio critica qua Deuteronomium diversum a prioribus Penta teuchiteuchi libris, alius cuiusdam recentioris auctoris opus esse demonstrator (Jena, 1805). De Wette proposed that the core of Deuteronomy should be dated to the late seventh century b.c.e. and should be equated with the "book of the law" found during the reign of Judahite king Josiah (see 2 Kings 22). He held that the document was not found but was a pious fraud. More recent work has helped to confirm this thesis. Perhaps the single most important study in this regard is Bernard M. Levinson's Deuteronomy and the Hermeneutics of Legal Innovation (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002). See also Jeffrey Stackert, Rewriting the Torah: Literary Revision in Deuteronomy Deuteronomy and the Holiness Legislation (FAT 52; Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2007). A noteworthy voice of dissent can be found in John Van Seters, A Law Book for the Diaspora: Revision in the Study Study of the Covenant Code (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002). 15Julius Wellhausen, Prolegomena to the History of Israel, With a Reprint of the Article "Israel""Israel" from the Encyclopaedia Britannica (trans. J. Sutherland Black and Allan Menzies; Edinburgh: A. 8c C. Black, 1885), 376-79. As Wellhausen relates, August Klostermann had already claimed as much and was the first to label the corpus with what has become its modern designation—"Law of Holiness" (Prolegomena, 379). 16See the summary in Jacob Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16: A New Translation with Introduction and and Commentary (AB 3; New York: Doubleday, 1991), 13-35. As Milgrom makes clear, much of the crucial work for his theory has been performed by Israel Knohl. See Israel Knohl, "The Concept of God and Cult in the "Priestly Torah" and the "Holiness School" (Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 1988); idem, The Sanctuary of Silence: The Priestly Torah and the Holiness School School (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995). See also Baruch J. Schwartz, The Holiness Legislation: Studies Studies in the Priestly Code (in Hebrew; Jerusalem: Magnes, 1999); Stackert, Rewriting the Torah, Christophe Nihan, From Priestly Torah to Pentateuch: A Study in the Composition of the Book of Leviticus Leviticus (FAT 2/25; Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2007). 17"Chapter 15 (to Moses) seems to be written by the editor (not the author) of the collection Lev. 17-26, because there are remarkable reminiscences and similarities." See Julius Wellhausen, Die Die Composition des Hexateuchs und der historischen Bûcher des Alten Testaments (2nd ed.; Berlin: Georg Reimer, 1889), 177. Concerning Wellhausens suggestion, Nihan astutely points out that, since Wellhausen locates Numbers 15 not with the author but with the editor of Leviticus 17-26, he basically foreshadows the modern theory of the post-Priestly Holiness redactor/ school. See Nihan, From Priestly Torah to Pentateuch, 570 n. 674.</page><page sequence="7">Reynolds:Reynolds: The Expression ביד רמה in the Hebrew Bible and the DSS 591 text.18 For Knohl, the pericope exhibits a hallmark feature of the Holiness School: it attempts to integrate both priestly and popular cultic traditions into one fabric.19 This fabric emphasizes the "personal and anthropomorphic expressions of the rela tionships between God and man."20 According to Knohl, "The main issue is not that willful transgression creates impurity, but rather that it indicates rebellion against a commanding God whose reason for giving the law is 'I, the Lord.'"21 Knohl s distinction between P's focus on the group and H s focus on the individual might help to explain the differing meanings of the expression "with an uplifted hand" found in each. According to Knohl, H extends the notion of holiness to include all areas of (personal) life. Not only that, it also "applies to the entire community of Israel and the land they inhabit."22 Examples of the expression ביד רמה found in traditional P material use it to describe the actions of the people collectively. Num bers 15, however, uses it to frame the individual's personal offense against the deity and to explain how this personal offense should affect the community status of the individual. In other words, because the notion of holiness has been extended to the personal level, it becomes necessary to spell out community implications (when the notion was applied only to the group, community status was irrelevant). In what follows, I suggest that the notion of sin and the focus on the community status of the individual sinner in Num 15:22-31 helps to explain the influence of the passage on legal works discovered at Qumran. Intentional sins result in the sinner being "cut off from his people."23 This language seems to have been particularly helpful 18 Knohl, "The Sin Offering Law in the ,Holiness School' (Numbers 15.22-31 )," in Priesthood and and Cult in Ancient Israel (ed. Gary A. Anderson and Saul M. Olyan; JSOTSup 125; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1991). See the response by Jacob Milgrom and the rejoinder by Knohl in Jacob Migrom, "Two Notes on Numbers 15:22-31 and Its Purpose" (in Hebrew), Tarbiz 60 (1991): 429; and Israel Knohl, "Response: To Jacob Milgrom's Comments on I. Knohl's Article" (in Hebrew), Tarbiz Tarbiz 60 (1991): 431-34. More recently, see Jacob Milgrom, Leviticus 17-22: A New Translation with with Introduction and Commentary (AB 3A; New York: Doubleday, 2000), 1343-44. 19I am entirely convinced by Knohl that the Holiness School postdates P, but I cannot agree with his early dates of composition for each one (PT beginning as early as the Solomonic temple and HS beginning in the eighth century b.c.e.). See Knohl, "Concept of God and Cult," 4,89,113; also idem, Sanctuary of Silence, 53,90. A more recent proposal for a Persian-period (fifth century) date is more persuasive; see Nihan, From Priestly Torah to Pentateuch, 545-59. Eckart Otto also has argued effectively for a Persian-period date (398 b.c.e.) (Das Deuteronomium im Pentateuch undund Hexateuch: Studien zur Literaturgeschichte von Pentateuch und Hexateuch im Lichte des DeuteronomiumrahmensDeuteronomiumrahmens [FAT 30; Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2000], 196-211). 20Knohl, "Sin Offering Law," 202-3. 21Ibid., 203. 22Knohl, Sanctuary of Silence, 180. 23For treatments of how this passage was related to others such as Leviticus 4 and 5:20-26 in various ancient Jewish contexts, see Anthony Phillips, "The Undetectable Offender and the Priestly Legislators," JTS 36 (1985): 146-50.

II.II. Qumran There are fourteen attestations of the expression ביד רמה in the Qumran non biblical texts. They are distributed among seven different documents: Serek haYahad, Damascus Damascus Document, 4QOrdinances, 4QpPsa (Pesher on Psalms), 4QMidrEschatd (i.e.,(i.e., Catena B), 4QMMT (Miqsat Macase haTorah), and 4QApocryphon of Jere miah C. Perhaps the most striking point to notice before inquiring about the indi vidual usages is that, with the exception of the last text, all of the aforementioned texts are considered Essene (or, sectarian) texts.24 Space does not allow a full discus sion of the criteria used to determine Essene/sectarian authorship, but these texts are not usually considered controversial cases.25 While not all of the documents 24The expression ביד רמה is not actually preserved in 4QApocryphon of Jeremiah C, but I agree with Devorah Dimant that it should probably be reconstructed in overlapping fragments 4Q385a 3a-c, 4Q388a 3 7, and 4Q387 1. See Qumran Cave 4.XXI: Parabiblical Texts, Part 4: Pseudo-Prophetic Pseudo-Prophetic Texts (ed. Devorah Dimant; DJD 30; Oxford: Clarendon, 2001), 205. 25For the kinds of criteria used to determine Essene authorship, see Armin Lange, "Kriterien essenischer Texte," in Qumran Kontrovers: Beitrdge zu den Textfunden vom Toten Meer (ed. Jorg Frey and Hartmut Stegemann; Paderborn: Bonifatius, 2003), 59-69. In the same volume, see Charlotte Hempel, "Kriterien zur Bestimmung 'essenischer Verfasserschaft' von Qumran texten," 71-85.

The most recent and thorough discussion is Lange's. He organizes criteria into two categories: inclusive and exclusive. Inclusive criteria would include, for example, the use of otherwise rare or specialized terminology such as מורה הצדק ("the teacher of righteousness") or היחד ("the community") and distinct halakah (e.g., a ruling on the moment when Shabbat begins each week). Exclusive criteria would include, for example, use of the Tetragrammaton outside of quotations or a text that can be dated paleographically before around 150 b.c.e. All criteria employ circular logic to one extent or another, since there exists no document that explicitly claims to be Essene. But the distinct literary features, theological positions, and historical claims that one finds in a constellation of the texts discovered at Qumran demand attention. Archaeological evidence tying the scrolls to the first-century settlement at Qumran transforms this demand into an imperative. For the archaeology of Qumran, see Jodi Magness, The Archaeology of Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls (Studies in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Related Literature; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2002), esp. 73-104. Magness presents a nuanced view that, in general terms, confirms the conclusions of the original excavator, Roland de Vaux.

Happily, this means that the present study will provide data not simply about the broad category of Second Temple Judaism but about a more specific subset of Juda ism. Examples of the expression ביד רמה occur in four types of literature: texts concerned with religious law, historical narrative texts, apocalyptic texts (ex eventu prophecy), and exegetical texts. Qumran:Qumran: Texts Concerned with Religious Law Damascus Damascus Document While the expression ביד רמה occurs five times in various manuscripts of the Damascus Damascus Document, only two are distinct. 4QDa (4Q266) 3 iv 6 is paralleled by CD 8:8 and 4QDa 8 iii 3 is paralleled by CD 10:3 as well as a reconstructed portion of 4QDe (4Q270) 6 iv 15. Since there are no major disagreements between the manuscripts in the lines that are relevant to this study, and since the CD (Cairo Genizah) manuscripts are significantly better preserved than those from cave 4,1 cite the CD manuscripts below. One other usage in D (Damascus texts) is part of a historical narrative. It is discussed below in a section devoted to its genre. For now I concentrate on the example from a legal context.26 D was read by the Qumran community and perhaps edited by them. The text seems to have functioned as a foundational or constitutional document, though not necessarily in the same way for all of its readers.27 206-25.

Robert Cargill argues that the site was originally a military installation but later a sectarian settlement related to the caves (Qumran Through Through (Real) Time: A Virtual Reconstruction of Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls [Bible in Technology 1; Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias, 2009]). See also the conversation between Magness and Cargill in JNES 71 (2008): 42-47. 26 The distinction between narrative and legal sections of D goes back to Solomon Schechter, Documents Documents of Jewish Sectaries, vol. 1, Fragments of a Zadokite Work (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1910). I am not aware of any scholar who doubts the generic and methodological logic of this division.

Prescriptions are given for the suitability of a witness or witnesses based on the nature of the crime and the standing of the potential witness in the community. For example, a death penalty may not be imposed based on only one eyewitness who is not a full member of the group. The rule relevant for this study reads, "A witness who has flagrantly transgressed any matter the law [איש עובר דבר מן המצוה ביד רמה] shall not be trusted (in testimony) against his neighbor until his purity returns [or, "his trustworthiness is reestab lished," זכו לשוב]" (CD 10:2b-3). This usage of ביד רמה is similar to the one found in Num 15:30 in at least two important ways. First, the law applies to individuals, not the people as a whole. Second, the law has specific implications for one's com munity status. If one has committed an offense and it was not unintentional, ones ability to play a part in community jurisprudence is compromised. Community status is not disconnected from notions of purity, but as Knohl points out about H, it involves much more than purity concerns. Unlike in Numbers 15, the offender is not fully expelled from the community—only from certain aspects of community life. constructions of community authority and covenantal identity" (Reading for History in the Damascus Damascus Document: A Methodological Study [STDJ 45; Leiden: Brill, 2002], 24). Studies by Grossman and others have helped to show the extent to which the use of language and motifs reflecting isolation and outsider status might more accurately reveal a sects self-imagination than the sociohistorical reality in which they lived. This is not to say that there is no history (in the traditional sense) in the text or that it cannot be analyzed and reconstructed. There are several different interpretations of the history narrated in the "Admonition" as well as of the degree to which the "Laws" represent lived reality in the community. Until recently, most of these theories were variations on the two major models of the Essene/Qumran community. Representative presentations of the Qumran-Essene hypothesis and the Groningen hypothesis can be found, respectively, in Hartmut Stegemann, "The Qumran Essenes: Local Members of the Main Jewish Union in Late Second Temple Times," in The Madrid Qumran Congress: Proceedings of the International International Congress on the Dead Sea Scrolls, Madrid, 18-21 March, 1991 (ed. Julio Trebolle Barrera Barrera and Luis Vegas Montaner; 2 vols.; STDJ ll;Leiden: Brill, 1992), 1:83-166; and Florentino Garcia Martinez and A. S. van der Woude, "A Groningen Hypothesis of Qumran Origins and Early History," RevQ 56 (1990): 521-41. Two recent monographs have pushed in a different direction: Alison Schofield, From Qumran to the Yahad: A New Paradigm of Textual Development for for The Community Rule (STDJ 77; Leiden: Brill, 2008); and John J. Collins, Beyond the Qumran Community:Community: The Sectarian Movement of the Dead Sea Scrolls (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2010). More discussion of these studies follows below in the section on Serek haYahad. Collins finds no inner-group conflict responsible for creating the Qumran community (contra the Groningen hypothesis) and emphasizes that neither D nor S (rule texts) posit a conflict with the Jerusalem high priest as the raison d'être of the Qumran community. Both Collins and Schofield argue that the group living at Qumran was one of several related groups and that the nonlinear editorial patterns in S and D indicate a sociohistorical reality that is larger than the one experienced at Qumran alone.</page><page sequence="11">Reynolds:Reynolds: The Expression ביד רמה in the Hebrew Bible and the DSS 595 SerekSerek haYahad (Community Rule) There are four distinct examples of the expression ביד רמה in Serek haYahad (1QS and other S texts).28 Like the Damascus Document, Serek haYahad can be characterized as a foundational or constitutional document. Until relatively recently, the Damascus Document was viewed as a constitutional document for the Essenes writ large and Serek haYahad was seen as a similar document for the more limited Essene group at Qumran. Recent work has complicated this idea.29 Building on the research of Sarianna Metso, who had already argued that the redactions to S were often anthological rather than corrective and that there were at least three distinct versions of S, John J. Collins and Alison Schofield have suggested new models for understanding S and its place at Qumran. While they disagree on some issues, both hold that S provides evidence for a much larger and less centralized (Essene) move ment than the one located at Qumran—even if literary strata within S provide evidence for an (elite) group (of Essenes) at Qumran.30 It is of special interest to 28 Jacob Milgrom has already noted a connection between the use of ביד רמה in Num 15:30 and S (Cult and Conscience: The Asham and the Priestly Doctrine of Repentance [SJLA 18; Leiden: Brill, 1976], 109-10). I cannot agree, however, that the Numbers text offers a way to mitigate punishment for intentional sin through repentance (or penance) as one finds in some of the Qumran texts. It seems to me that the Qumran texts offer an innovation in this area, as well as in their distinctions between community members' status. 29There are several redactional layers in Serek haYahad, and some portions may have had independent literary lives before incorporation into the whole (e.g., 1QS 3:13-4:14, the "Treatise on the Two Spirits"). Not all of 1QS was written by the Qumran community or even necessarily by Essenes at all. See Sarianna Metso, The Textual Development of the Qumran Community Rule (STDJ 21; Leiden: Brill, 1997), 107-49; see also eadem, The Serekh Texts (Companion to the Qumran Scrolls 9; London: T&amp;T Clark, 2007), esp. 13-20. For Metso, the literary form of 1QS represents a relatively late stage of the text, despite the fact that the manuscript dates perhaps a half-century earlier than the cave 4 manuscripts (for the opposite view, see Philip S. Alexander, "The Redaction-History of Serekh Ha-Yahad: A Proposal," RevQ 17 [1996]: 437-56). More recently, Metso has emphasized that variant manuscripts of S seem to be "cumulative" rather than "up-to-date." In other words, the editorial work appears to be more anthological than corrective. Metso presented these ideas in a paper [read by Hindy Najman], "The Place of 1QS in the Legal Corpus of the Essenes," at the Sixth Meeting of the IOQS in Ljubljana, Slovenia, in 2007. 30Collins supports the priority of D, but he rejects the idea that S served as a specialized document for the Qumran group alone. He sees the yahad of S as likely equivalent to the "New Covenant" of D and finds little evidence in either document of an internal struggle that might have produced the Qumran community (Beyond the Qumran Community, 65-69). Collins does find that S contains the rationale for the existence of the Qumran group, which he characterizes as both elite and celibate (pp. 69-75). Schofield also argues that the members of the yahad were probably Essenes and lived in multiple areas, one of which was Qumran. She argues that a radial dialogic model explains the transmission and development of S far better than a linear chronological model limited to Qumran. While accepting many of Metso's claims about the transmission history of S, she voices more caution about their relative chronology and suggests that some of the variants might have been produced in various communities and gathered together at Qumran only in a time of crisis (From Qumran to the Yahad, 125-29; see, more</page><page sequence="12">596 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 3 (2013) this study that three of the four examples of ביד רמה derive from a significant expansion of S that may have been made at Qumran.31 The first example of the expression ביד רמה is found in 1QS 5:12. The passage is part of a section of 1QS (5:1-20) that could be described as general rules for conduct. It reads, "And the revealed laws they intentionally transgress [עשה ביד רמה] to stoke God's anger to judgment and to exact vengeance with the curses of the covenant, to execute against them great judgments." The immediate context of this passage is found in an allusion to Zeph 1:6 in the previous line, "They 'have not sought sought Him nor inquired of His statutes' so as to discover the hidden laws in which they err to their shame."32 The subject of the sentence ("they") refers to Jewish people in a general sense (i.e., not any sectarians in particular). It is one matter to transgress the "hidden laws" but quite another to transgress laws that everyone ostensibly knows. The text indicts those who cannot achieve even a minimum level of obedience to the law. The three remaining examples from 1QS each derive from what was formerly understood as the oldest section of the Serek haYahad: col. 8 and the beginning of col. 9. This section discusses a group consisting of three priests and twelve laymen that is distinguished from the larger yahad. It was once proposed that these indi viduals were the original founders of the Qumran group.33 Collins has most recently countered this claim and argued that the special group may be related to Qumran but does not represent the founders of the movement. Rather, they represent a small, elite branch of the larger and already established yahad.34 The second example of the expression ביד רמה occurs in 1QS 8:17 (cf. 4QSd recently, eadem, "Between Center and Periphery: The Yahad in Context," DSD 16 [2009]: 330 50). For earlier work in this direction, see Torleif Elgvin, "The Yahad Is More than Qumran," in Enoch Enoch and Qumran Origins: New Light on a Forgotten Connection (ed. Gabriele Boccaccini; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2005), 273-79. 31 The section 1QS 8:15-9:12 is missing from lQSe. Metso has made a compelling argument that lQSe represents the earlier version ("The Primary Results of the Reconstruction of 4QSe," JJS 44 [1993]: 303-8; see also Textual Development, 72). Collins suggests that 1QS material reflects the elite, desert-dwelling Qumran community (Beyond the Qumran Community, 69-75). On the other hand, the first example in S (1QS 5:12) may derive from one of the oldest versions of S (manuscript damage precludes knowing whether the keywords were preserved, but part of 1QS 5 is preserved in 4QSb׳d, which probably predate 1QS). 32Trans.

The immediate context of the usage is the quotation of Isa 40:3 three lines above, "In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God." The writer interprets the passage as follows: This means the expounding of the Law, that he commanded by the hand of Moses to execute according to everything revealed unto each age, in the same manner as the prophets have revealed His holy spirit. No man belonging to the Covenant of the Community, the Community, who intentionally turns aside from any of his commands [יסור מכול מצוה דבר ביד רמה],/ram even a word, shall not lay a finger on the pure food of the holy men. (8:15-17)35 The writer uses Isa 40:3 to explain the purpose of the community's flight into the wilderness and the subsequent purpose of their daily activities. Line 17 deals with individuals who are not yet full-fledged members and makes clear that there will be no toleration of deviation from what the community perceives to be the author itative interpretation of the teaching of Moses. The writer goes on to say, "He is not to participate in any of their deliberations until all his works have been cleansed from evil, so that he is again able to walk blamelessly" (8:18). This usage is similar to that in CD 10:3. It employs parallel terminology (here סור instead of עבר) to describe transgression of the commandment (המצוה). It also focuses on community status and provides another example of how intentional sin can cost one status. We saw in CD 10:3 (= 4QDa 8 iii 3; = 4QDe 6 iv 15) that acting "with an uplifted hand" could affect ones ability to participate in community jurisprudence. In 1QS 8:17, the offender loses access to the pure food of the community. The third example of the expression ביד רמה from 1QS is found in 8:22: "Any covenant member of theyahad of holiness—they who walk blamelessly as He com manded—who transgresses even one commandment from the Law of Moses inten tionallytionally or deviously [אשר יעבר דבר מתורת מושה ביד רמה או ברמיה] is to be expelled from the part of the yahad, never to return. Further, none of the holy men is to do business with that man or advise him on any matter whatsoever." The language used in the passage is similar to what is used in CD 10:3: עובר דבר מן המצוה ביד רמה. Here המצוה ("the commandment") is rendered as מתורת מושה ("the teaching of Moses"). Both texts use the term עבר to describe the performance of the offending activity. While the penalty for one who is not a full member is significant, the punish ment for a full community member is severe: banishment. This passage presents the closest parallel to Num 15:30 in terms of the punishment assigned to those who act ביד רמה. Excommunication is the punishment for breaking the law intentionally. In a surprise, however, the Serek seems to exercise more moderation than the 35As Metso has pointed out (Serekh Texts, 12-14), the regulations collected in the "penal code" found in 1QS cols. 8-9 are vaguer than the ones in cols. 6-7, where, for example, specific periods of punishment are specified.</page><page sequence="14">598 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 3 (2013) Numbers passage in that new members are not held to the same standard as full members. In Numbers, both natives and sojourners are equally subject to the law. The fourth example from 1QS is found in 9:1 and shares the same immediate context as the passage from 8:22 quoted above. Any member of the community who has transgressed the Law of Moses "with an uplifted hand" (or, intentionally) shall be excommunicated. 1QS 9:1 specifically contrasts banishment with the pun ishment meted out to an unintentional sinner: "For a single unintentional sin may be punished by this two-year process, but the intentional sinner ולעושה ביד רמה shall never again return."36 The "two-year process" is elaborated in 8:24-27. The accidental sinner is disallowed from the pure food, community deliberations, and jurisprudence for two years.37 Provided that he does not sin any more, he is allowed to continue to attend study and sit in the general council—no light penalty for "a single unintentional sin." The contrast between explicit intentional sin and unin tentional sin in this example, as well as its associations with community status, makes clear that it, like the other examples from the Serek haYahad, inherits the concept of ביד רמה from Num 15:30. 4QOrdinancesa4QOrdinancesa 4QOrdinancesa (4Q159) is a legal text similar to Serek haYahad. It can be described as halakah, at least in a general sense. It is only sparsely preserved. The expression ביד רמה is found in 2-4:6: "He shall be put to death, whoever has sinned intentionally [עשה ביד רמה]." The context maybe described as instruction for how various offenses should be adjudicated. Unfortunately, around half of the previous line is missing. One hopes that a serious offense was indicated in those missing words. While the manuscript is poorly preserved and allows only a little insight into the precise context of the line, it seems that the stakes of acting ביד רמה have risen in this text. In Serek haYahad such actions might have resulted in the exile of the offender, depending on the persons community status at the time of the infrac tion. 4QOrdinancesa prescribes death. There is no evidence to suggest that such a penalty was ever carried out among Essenes. One suspects that the function of this text might have been more rhetorical than juridical. It is interesting that no metrics for intent are specifically prescribed. Regardless of whether such a sentence was ever carried out, the ruling indicates that individual sin affects community status in a permanent way.38 In any case, the usage of ביד רמה in 4QOrdinancesa, like that 36There is a textual variant for ולעושה ביד רמה in 4QSd 7:2 (4Q258): וליד הרמה. The discrepancy seems to have begun as a case of parablepsis. After realizing that he had skipped the participle עושה, the scribe made "uplifted hand" definite in order to keep the sense of the sentence. 37This passage may represent an intentional editorial combination of ideas from D and S. 38It is intriguing that the regulations that follow this one proscribe men and women from wearing each other's clothes. Thus, 4QOrdinancesa should best be viewed as a random collection of laws. See Joseph M. Baumgarten, "Scripture and Law in 4Q265," in Biblical Perspectives: Early</page><page sequence="15">Reynolds:Reynolds: The Expression ביד רמה in the Hebrew Bible and the DSS 599 in the D and S texts, should be viewed in light of the community regulations in Num 15:30, not the standard biblical connotations where being ביד רמה is a vice or virtue depending on whether one is inherently good or bad from the perspective of the writer. 4QMiqsat4QMiqsat Macase ha-Torah (4QMMT) The genre and function(s) of 4QMMT remain contested.39 Elisha Qimron and John Strugnell describe the text as an epistolary treatise "on certain points of tra ditional Zadokite legal praxis."40 Regardless of whether MMT functioned as real legal diplomacy or, for example, a pedagogical tool used exclusively within the community, it is a polemical work that decries cultic errors and appeals for correc tion. Its style is characterized by the raising of a legal topic with the formula ועל or ואף על ("and concerning") and then giving a judgment prefixed by the formula אנחנו אומרים ("we are of the opinion"). The relevant passage for this article is found in two different manuscripts of the same passage: 4QMMTC (4Q396) 1-2 iii 10 and 4QMMTd (4Q397) frags. 6-13, line 9. Each requires various degrees of reconstruction, and the expression ביד רמה must be fully reconstructed in both. One can reconstruct the expression with a high degree of certainty, however, given the extant content. A combined edition of both manuscripts reads, "and concerning him who sins intentionally (העושה ביד רמה), it is writjten that he is despicable and a blasph[em]er (מג[ד]ף)." This ruling stands in contrast to the punishment prescribed for the unintentional sinner, who may Use Use Use and Interpretation of the Bible in Light of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

Ultimately, the text probably does not preserve sufficient data to help the reader understand whether its epistle-like features reflect an actual letter or if they are merely rhetorical techniques. Of course, the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive. 40Qimran and Strugnell, "Miqsat Macase ha-Torah" in Qumran Cave 4.V: Miqsat Macase ha-Torahha-Torah (DJD 10; Oxford: Clarendon, 1994), 121. They argue that the "halakic" letter was written by the "Teacher of Righteousness" to the "Wicked Priest" not as a personal letter but on behalf of the community. If the wicked priest was a historical figure outside the Qumran community, MMT seems to suggest that he was a high priest in Jerusalem. If so, several candidates might be possible: Alcimus, Jonathan Maccabeus, Simon Maccabeus, and John Hyrcanus. According to Hanan Eshel, descriptions of the Wicked Priest in Pesher Habakkuk (lQpHab 8:13 9:2; 9:8-12; 11:8-12:3) and 4QpPsa (4:7-10) strongly indicate an identification with Jonathan the Maccabee.

The writer employs the concepts of intentional and unintentional sin together and specifically refers to Num 15:30 with the formula "it is written" (כת]1ב]) when the writer decrees that the guilty person is a blasphemer (מג[ד]ף): "But the person who does anything with an upraised hand [i.e., "who sins intentionally"], whether a native or a sojourner, he blasphemes [מגדף] Yhwh" (Num 15:30).41 Indeed, MMT seems to present a tongue-in-cheek reminder of Num 15:30 to its addressee when it states ואתם יודעים ("And you know ...") (4QMMTC 1-2 iii 8 = 4QMMTd frags. 6-13, line 8). The implication is that the addressee does not know or does not cor rectlyrectly understand Num 15:30. MMT thus adds one more example to the list of Essene legal texts that invoke the same meaning for ביד רמה as in Num 15:30, the anomalous meaning from the Hebrew Bible. This collection of usages suggests that the meaning of ביד רמה in Num 15:30 has developed into a technical term in the legal texts from the Dead Sea Scrolls. In other words, we find multiple, consistent usages across a literary genre. In the next section, I show that the expression is used elsewhere in the Dead Sea Scrolls, but never with the technical meaning "intentional sin" outside of legislation. Qutnran:Qutnran: Historical Narrative Damascus Damascus Document CD 8:8 is part of a passage that attempts to recount why it was necessary for a group of Jews (Essenes?) to separate themselves from other Jews. The writer char acterizes Jewish society-at-large as follows: "And they fought for wealth and profit, and each man did what was right in his own eyes. Each man chose to act42 with a hardened-heart and did not separate himself from the people. They cast off restraint arrogantly [8:8) "[ויפרעו ביד רמה). It is for this reason that the writer concludes, "And thus is the judgment of the penitents of Israel, who abandoned the path of the people on account of God's love for the forefathers who testified43 about him: He loves those who come after them, because to them belongs the fathers' covenant" (8:16-18a).44 The expression ביד רמה here seems to approximate the description 41See Biblical Quotations and Allusions in Second Temple Jewish Literature (ed. Armin Lange and Matthias Weigold; Journal of Ancient Judaism Supplements 5; Gôttingen: Vanden hoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2011), 28.

The main idea is arro gance, hubris, or defiance. Like the biblical P texts discussed above, however, it applies the expression to a group, not an individual. The standard "biblical" (P) meaning is also employed in exegetical texts from Qumran. Qumran:Qumran: Exegetical Texts 4QpPsa4QpPsa (4Q171) 3-10 iv 14-15 4QpPsa is a pesher (or, commentary) on the book of Psalms. Armin Lange has concisely described the function of both line-by-line and thematic pesharim: "The pesharimpesharim isolate items out of their biblical lemmata and re-contextualize them into the life of the Essene movement."45 The context of 4QpPsa 3-10 iv 14-15 is a quota tion of Ps 37:35-36 in lines 13-14. "I [have seen] a ruthless person [ like a cedar of Lebanon.] I pass by before [him, and, 10,] he is [no more;] though I [seek him] he is not [to be found]." Psalm 37 is conventionally referred to as a "theodicy."46 Its engagement with the theme of theodicy as well as the style of its construction, with repeated exhortations such as "do not fret" (אל־תתחד) followed by explanations, are features familiar from wisdom instructions. It is notable that the writer of Psalm 37 does not contend that the solution to the problem of theodicy is in any sense eschatological. Rather, the writer operates within a Deuteronomic model. Appropriate punishments and rewards are meted out in this life. The writer states his opinion clearly (if not astoundingly) in 37:25-26: "I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging for bread. They are ever giving liberally and lending and their children become a bless ing" (NRSV). These verses make the interpretation of the pesher writer all the more interesting. The pesher writer isolates the "ruthless person" of Psalm 37 and re contextualizes him into the life of the community. The figure described by the psalmist as a "ruthless person" becomes the "man of lies," a figure significant for the Essenes (or a portion thereof).

It is unclear whether this passage equates the "man of lies" with the "wicked priest" who is invoked slightly earlier in the pesher. What is clear, however, is that, unlike the legal texts discussed above, 4QpPsa does not use the expression ביד רמה to describe "intentional sin." Or, to be more precise, the technical meaning demanded by the legal texts above is not demanded here. Instead, the pesher writer seems to use the expression in the same way it was used in Exod 14:8; Num 33:3; and the similar expressions in 2 Kgs 11:26-27 and Job 35:18. It is a description of an attitude that could be described as both confidence and arrogance. The meanings are two sides of one coin; the matter is really whether one is "in" or "out" with the narrator.

Her thesis has met with general approval even if her terminology has not.48 If Steudel is correct, 4QMidrEschatd is part of a thematic pesher, that is, a pesher that is organized according to an overall theme instead of the typical line-by-line pesher that follows one "biblical" book at a time. In this case the theme is the eschaton.49 In 4QMidrEschatd, the expression ביד רמה is used together with the verb פרע as it was in the CD 8:8. It seems to occur in the context of a description of an escha tological judgment. Those under threat of judgment are described as people "who will stiffen their necks," as well as those who have "cast off restraint arrogantly" 47See Steudel, Der Midrasch zur Eschatologie aus der Qumrangemeinde (4QMidrEschatab)■.

See also the discussion in Campbell, Exegetical Texts, 43-55; and the review by Devorah Dimant, DSD 10 (2003): 305-10. 49Little remains of the text, but the first lines of both fragments mention the "end of days" (אחרית הימים). I agree with Shemaryahu Talmon that the expression itself cannot be a trustworthy indicator of eschatological concern. Context is key. See Talmon, "The Signification of אחרית and אחרית הימים in the Hebrew Bible," in Paul et al., Emanuel, 795-810. There is precious little context available in this text but the invocation of the prophecy of Jeremiah in the context of a vaticiniumvaticinium ex eventu and the prefix-conjugation form of קשה seem to indicate that an eschatological translation is appropriate here.</page><page sequence="19">Reynolds:Reynolds: The Expression ביד רמה in the Hebrew Bible and the DSS 603 (ויפרעו ביד רמה). Like CD 8:8 and 4QpPsa, 4QMidrEschatd uses the expression in the more general sense of "arrogance." The expression describes the attitude of a group. The meaning is not a technical, legal one. Apocalypse Apocalypse The ApocryphonThe ApocryphonThe Apocryphon of Jeremiah C (4Q387) 1:1-10 (Combined Edition 30-39) = 4Q385a4Q385a 3 2-10 (Combined Edition 28-35) The Apocryphon of Jeremiah C is a nonsymbolic apocalypse found in at least five manuscripts, all from cave 4.50 The Apocryphon of Jeremiah C only partially preserves the expression ביד רמה, but Dimant's reconstruction is easily defended.51 The context is a description of the period leading up to the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem and exile in 586 b.c.e. The ex eventu prophecy names several offenses for which punishment is imminent. The expression probably occurs in three over lapping fragments. Here I quote from a combined edition of the text:52 31 And you said, "You have abandoned u[s our God," but you have rejected my statutes] 32 [and you have forgotten] the festivals of my covenant and you have profaned [my name and my holy things] 33 [and you have defiled] my temple and you have sacrificed [your sacrifices to goat demons and you (have) 34 and you have broken all (aspects of the covenant) arrogan[tly] ([ביד ר[מה) Five offenses are listed: (1) rejection of statutes, (2) failure to observe festivals, (3) illegitimate use of divinely oriented words and objects, (4) inappropriate sacri fices, and (5) arrogant transgression of laws. All of the offenses listed are cultic in nature. Moreover, they address the nation, not individuals. The punishments described in the text are applied indiscriminately to all people. So the question of community status is irrelevant. The context of the Apocryphon of Jeremiah C implies a general connotation of the expression "with an uplifted hand." This meaning is 50For a summary of the debate over how the manuscripts 4Q383-391 should be organized, see Bennie H.

III. Conclusions The expression ביד רמה and other similar expressions are used in the Hebrew Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls to convey different meanings. Most of the meanings are variations on the theme of power: arrogance, rebellion, defiance, victory. One nuance of the expression, however, stands apart. In Num 15:30, ביד רמה expresses the opposite of תחטא בשגגה, "someone who (should) sin unintentionally." The expression communicates intentionality, perhaps premeditation. Among the sec tarian texts surveyed in this study, the legal texts all employ ביד רמה in the sense in which it is used in Num 15:30, a usage that is anomalous in the Hebrew Bible. Indeed, 4QMMT cites Num 15:30 unambiguously as its base text. Essene legal texts follow Num 15:30 not only by borrowing the expression "with an uplifted hand," but in spelling out specific implications of intentional sin for group membership/ identity. The need to create legislative stipulations on community status may be traced back to the Holiness writer's extension of the notion of holiness past the group to the individual. The unique polity of the Essenes made Num 15:22-31 a source from which to construct and organize religious law and social identity. The legal texts from Qumran differ from Numbers 15 in that they envision jurisprudence operat ing differently for each level of the hierarchical structure of the community. But they also differ from each other in their conceptions of how to restore status in the community. 1QS 5:12 holds that the intentional sins of all Jews brought about Gods anger and the curses of the covenant, that is, the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in 586 b.c.e. and its aftermath. The intentional sin is not mere arrogance but inap propriate execution of the cult. CD 10:3 addresses a different group. It proscribes novices guilty of intentional sin from participating in jurisprudence. 1QS 8:17 goes a step further by proscribing not only participation in legal deliberations but also sharing in the pure food. This addition represents not only a stricter penalty but a more complex conception of restoring and preserving the integrity of the entire community. Full community members face the most severe penalty: banishment ( 1 QS 8:22; 9:1). Interestingly, full community members must be convicted of trans gressing תורת מושה ("the law of Moses") to be excommunicated. Novices' sin in both S and D is framed in terms of המצוה ("the commandment"). The same mean ing may be intended in both cases, but it is of possible significance that different terminology is used for the different tiers of the community. Neither of the final two legal texts specifies a particular law or teaching that is transgressed, but MMT explicitly alludes to Num 15:30 and uses the formula "it is written" in a way that</page><page sequence="21">Reynolds:Reynolds: The Expression ביד רמה in the Hebrew Bible and the DSS 605 seems to indicate that Num 15:30 is a law recognized by the high priest. Finally, 4QOrdinancesa seems to have more rhetorical than practical value. Nevertheless, it too ties a technical connotation of the expression ביד רמה to ones personal com munity status. Each text shows innovation to the extent that Num 15:30 reflects neither lev els of membership nor punishment tiers. But each is also indebted to Num 15:30 and the Holiness School more generally to the extent that they place focus on the person rather than on the nation or group. It is perhaps this aspect of H's theology that made it especially appealing to the writers of Essene legal texts. As various writers sought to define more rigidly how intentional sin affected various categories of individuals within their community(/ies), the way the H writer/redactor made use of the expression "with an uplifted hand" provided a paradigm that exists nowhere else in Jewish literature before the destruction of the Second Temple. Essene writers would not have made distinctions between what modern scholars label as P and H material in pentateuchal books, but modern literary analysis of the Pentateuch can shed light on how and why certain texts had the particular influences that they did. In other words, it is now more obvious how the legal/liter ary innovations of the postexilic Holiness School ultimately played a role in the later development of Essene/sectarian constructions of identity. Literary and lin guistic analyses provide a partial genealogy of sin between the Holiness School and the Essenes. H's focus on individual status paved the way for a much more robust imagining of the individual in Essene legal texts. Essene legal texts make distinc tions between several types of individuals. This perspective is broader than that of the Holiness School, but it is precisely in the postexilic legal innovations of the Holiness School that some of the seeds of Essene identity germinated. The Holiness School's extension of the concept of holiness from the collective to the individual made it possible for the Essenes to develop a unique notion of Jewish identity that tied the Torah faithfulness of various types of individuals to their community status.</page></plain_text>
