<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION: ITS AIM AND SCOPE. IN a certain broad sense philosophy of religion is as old as the history of reflective thought. In a narrower and more specific sense it is the product of the nineteenth century. In the broad sense of the term, any attempt to correlate religious views and practices with the scientific conception of the world, any at- tempt to harmonize religion and science from a philosophical standpoint, may be called a philosophy of religion. Among primitive peoples, as with the uneducated masses to-day, religion furnishes the only conception of the world as a whole. Philos- ophy arises when certain minds begin to feel dissatisfied with the current religious views of the world-whole. The demand arises for a world-view based on experience and reason, rather than on mythology and tradition. The various professions, such as medi- cine, architecture, etc., have had their origin in a differentiation from religion as cult. In the same way, philosophy, and indirectly the sciences, represent a differentiation from religion on its intel- lectual side. This close relation which philosophy sustained to religion in its beginning has been maintained on the whole all the way down through its history. It should continue to be main- tained, not, of course, for mere historical reasons, but because of intrinsic and essential connections. What these necessary con- nections are, we shall try to show in the latter half of this paper. Not only in its beginning did men resort to philosophy to find out the truth in religion, but always the perennial ground of the philosophic interest is the religious interest. The need of harmonizing human life with the ultimate ground of reality is felt first in a practical way. Hence religion. From this practical need springs the intellectual necessity to determine the nature of the Ultimate Real and its relation to humanity. Hence philos- ophy. The great philosophic minds in the history of thought, I believe, for the most part have first individually begun to feel</page><page sequence="2">464 T HE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. an interest in ultimate problems on the religious side, and then, under the pressure of logical needs, turned to philosophy. Re- ligion is the schoolmaster that leads men to philosophy. The rational interpretation of religion is one of the great aims of phi- losophy. Every philosopher from Xenophanes and Plato to Mr. Spencer and Professor Royce has dealt in some measure with the religious problem. With the possible exception of dogmatic materialism, all schools of philosophy have found some place for religion in their various theories of life. Dualists and monists, pluralists and pantheists, agnostics and idealists, each and all have found room for religion in some form in the realm of intel- ligent human action. Numberless as are the individual theories, we can trace three main types of method in dealing with the religious problem philosophically. i. The first of these type-methods may be called the method of elimination. It proposes to rationalize religion by striking out from it all that is false in theory and pernicious in practice, thus leaving only what is good and true. Ancient examples of this method are Xenophanes's attempt to remove all anthropomorphism from the conception of God, and Plato's demand that all poetry of questionable morality and theology be banished from the state. This method has been a favorite one with religious philosophers. Numerous instances of its use might be cited. Its most im- posing product, however, was the natural theology of the eight- eenth century. The concept of nature, as distinguished from the products of the human will, was current among the Sophists. Its most notable use by the ancients was in the ethical field. The Stoics developed the idea of morality as a law of nature, and applied this conception to Roman jurisprudence with most bril- liant results. The eighteenth century revived the concept of nature and made it the universal criterion. It became the stand- ard of value for all departments of human interest. Applied to economics it produced the physiocrats. In politics it gave the doctrine of natural rights, no mere theory of the closet, but a doctrine which was put forth by Locke to justify the English revolution of i688, and which furnished the ideals of government for the men that carried through both the American and the</page><page sequence="3">No. 5.] THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION. 465 French revolutions. Rousseau's famous theory of education was but another application of this same concept of nature. A con- cept which was playing such a brilliant role in ethics, in jurispru- dence, in politics both theoretical and practical, in economics, and in education, could not fail to be applied to religion. Hence the natural religion and natural theology of the period. In every department of life and thought the cry was: Back to nature! This meant in religion not only a denial of the supernatural and the miraculous, but also a negation of all history and all social evolution. In making ' the natural light,' i. e., the individual reason, the sole faculty of valid religious truth, it meant not only the denial of revelation, but also utter blindness to the psycho- logical ground of religion in man's emotional nature. It was a religion for pure intellects in unsocial isolation, but not for men. Comte's 'Religion of Humanity' is another product of the method of elimination. The cult and ritual of historical religion are retained; its theology is eliminated. The place of the Supreme Being, of which the positive philosophy denies us all knowledge, is taken by the Grand Being, Humanity, an idealized abstraction of universal man. The intellectual element is as lacking in the Religion of Humanity as was the emotional element in natural religion. Both are unhistorical abstractions. They and not the actual religion of the people have the artificiality which the philosopher so strongly deprecated. They are in truth 'arte- facts' to use Hobbes's term. Religion without emotion is empty; religion without thought is blind. Herbert Spencer's theory of religion may be noted as the final effort to treat the religious problem by this method. It is the result of the method of elimination carried to its limit. It is, too, the reductio ad absurdum of that method. The religion of the Unknowable is the absolute negation of religion. It has deceived its author and not a few others, because they have unwittingly furnished its emptiness with the forms and ideals of historical religion. Spencer's distribution of gifts -the knowable to science, the unknowable to religion, has always reminded me of the will, which left a house to be divided between two daughters, the inside to one, and the outside to the other.</page><page sequence="4">466 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. How one can have a religious attitude, or indeed an attitude of any sort, toward the unknowable quite passes understanding. 2. So much for the first method and its results. It tries to make religion rational by subtracting from positive religion what- ever in it seems to be irrational. In contrast with this, we may name the second typical form of religious philosophy the method of addition. In this case, the dogmas of a given religion are accepted as unquestionably true. With this point of view to start with, philosophy cannot look for irrational elements that may be discarded; rather must it seek to furnish a rational basis for religion as it finds it. Scholasticism comes to mind at once as the preeminent example of this method. At the dawn of the scholastic period there is a serene confidence that religion and philosophy are one. " True philosophy " says Erigena, " is true religion, and true religion is true philosophy." Two centuries later the identity seems less obvious, but Anselm is sure that a bridge of logic is all that is necessary to span the chasm. Logic, however, broke down when it was called upon to demonstrate the Trinity, Incarnation, and similar dogmas of the church. Still, Aquinas, while giving up all hope of proving these doctrines by the reason, and making them matters of pure faith, declared them not contrary to reason, but above reason, and he is still sure that the existence of God can be demonstrated along with certain other fundamentals, "the preambles of faith," as he calls them. Duns Scotus declares for the primacy of the will over the intellect, and endeavors to make religion a purely practical affair independent of reason and philosophy. William of Occam finds even the existence of God indemonstrable by the natural reason, and relegates all knowledge that transcends experience to the sphere of faith. Thus the age-long effort to reconcile religion and philosophy ends in the recognition of a complete disparity. Instead of a rational unity, the result is the acceptance of a two-fold truth. This doctrine may properly be regarded as the reductio ad absur- dum of the scholastic method. This seems to me a most pathetic chapter in the history of the struggles of the human spirit to free itself from contradictions. The confident assurance in the begin- ning of the unity of all truth, religious and philosophical; the</page><page sequence="5">No. 5.] THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION. 467 valiant use of all the weapons of logic; the gradual surrender of one hardly defended position for another; and, finally, the impo- tent conclusion in the doctrine of the twofold truth, a veritable apotheosis of the contradictory. 3. Such in rough outline are the methods and results of nat- ural theology and of scholasticism. Each had its day, and each has been weighed in the balance and found wanting. The I9th century has witnessed the growth of a new method and spirit in dealing with the religious problem. It is this new treat- ment of the subject to which the name philosophy of religion in the specific sense is given. The fundamental differences between these three methods may be seen in their respective attitudes toward actual religion. Scholasticism regards religion as a divine revelation ; natural theology regards it as a human in- vention; philosophy of religion takes it as a fact in human life to be interpreted. Both scholasticism and natural theology start with religion as a system of dogmas. The one takes them to be wholly true, the other to be largely false; the one seeks to demonstrate all, the other to sift out the irrational and prove only the rational residuum. Philosophy of religion regards religion as life, not as dogma. Like all life it is subject to growth and historical development, and like every aspect of human life it is an expression of human nature, a product of the human con- sciousness as it unfolds in its physical and social environment. As our view of religion changes from the idea that it is essentially dogma to the idea that it is primarily a mode of life, the inad- equacy of the categories *true' and 'false' becomes manifest. The positive religions are not to be classified out of hand as true or false, but to be studied as steps in the historical development of the religious consciousness. The categories of relative worth take the place of ' true' and ' false' in our estimate both of religions and of religion. The data for the study of religion are no longer to be sought in ready-made dogmas on the one hand, nor in a ready-made man and a ready-made world on the other. The data are to be sought in the comparative history of religions, in the analysis of the religious consciousness, and in the ethical and social phenomena of religious institutions. It is the work of</page><page sequence="6">468 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. what might properly be denominated the Science of Religion to describe and provisionally interpret the various facts of religion to be gathered from history, psychology, and sociology. Given these provisionally interpreted phenomena, it is the business of the philosophy of religion to evaluate religion in the light of our ultimate philosophical conclusions as to the relation of human life to reality as a whole. The contrast has often been drawn between the typical modes of thought of the i8th and i9th centuries. The thought of the former was individualistic and rationalistic. It was fond of mathe- matical and physical -categories. To escape the authority of the past it denied the validity of history. History and society, if ad- mitted at all as contributory factors in present reality, were re- garded as sources of deterioration. How characteristic of the age are the words with which Rousseau opens the Emile: "Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things; everything degenerates in the hands of man" ! Nine- teenth century thought has equal faith in intellectual freedom; but it knows better the limitations of the individual reason. The spiritual man can no more be severed from his spiritual environ- ment than the physical man from his physical environment. He is not the degenerate work of a perfect Author, but the pro- gressively developed product of historical and social forces. Social institutions were not established complete, whether by divine gift or human invention. They are the products of his- tory, and they can be understood only through a knowledge of their history. Biological categories have ousted the mathemat- ico-physical categories. Nowhere is the difference in the spirit of the thought of the two centuries more manifest than in a com- parison of the natural theology of the one with the philosophy of religion of the other. Lessing was, I believe, the first to apply the notion of a pro- gressive historical development to the interpretation of positive religions. For this he deserves to be honored as the founder of philosophy of religion, even though he does not in all respects escape the point of view of the natural theology of his age. Schleiermacher seems to have been the first to completely tran-</page><page sequence="7">No. 5-] THE PRILOSOPHY OF RELIGION. 469 scend the distinction of natural and revealed religion, and along with this to have seen that the essence of religion is an emotional attitude, and that the object of religious feeling is not a being apart from the world, but the principle of unity immanent in the world. With the conquest of these three standpoints, the evo- lutional character of religion, its essentially emotional nature, and the conception of God as immanent rather than transcendent, philosophy of religion separated itself completely from natural theology. Earlier thinkers sought to reform or to demonstrate the doctrines of religion. Now for the first time religion is really made an object of philosophical reflection. The phenomena of the religious life are taken like the given phenomena of any other group, and the philosopher tries to find out their meaning, and their true place in human life, and in the totality of the real. The name is justified, for not until this point of view is reached, can there be a philosophy of religion. Scholasticism was a ration- alized Catholicism; natural theology a rationalized Protest- antism; philosophy of religion is' a rational interpretation of man's religious life in its entirety. This comparison with other methods of dealing with the religious problem shows us something of the nature and spirit of Philosophy of Religion. For a closer determination of its aims and scope we must consider the natural relations of religion and philosophy. We may start for this purpose by dividing human interests and values roughly into the physical and the spiritual. But if we use this old classification, we must be care- ful to avoid the notion that the two are related merely as lower and higher, or as means and ends. Physical values are intrinsic as well as instrumental, and spiritual values are instrumental as well as intrinsic. The relation is a truly organic one. "Let us not always say 'Spite of this flesh to-day I strove, made head, gained ground upon the whole!' As the bird wings and sings, Let us cry, ' All good things Are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, Now, than flesh helps soul. '" This same organic relation subsists between the several types</page><page sequence="8">470 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. of spiritual value. Each is both end in itself, and instrument for the realization of human weal as a whole. The type-forms of spiritual value to which man is susceptible are the intellectual, the aesthetic, and the ethical. Science, art, and morality are the objects of these several interests as developed by our relations to the world of immediate experience. But besides these several interests in and attitudes toward the empirical world, man has developed a set of interests of a second order. He recognizes relations not only to the ' this, that, and the other,' but also to reality as a whole, and so to that in the totality of the real which transcends experience, as well as to that which is the direct object of experience. The product of our intellectual interest in the transcendent is philosophy, of our practical interest is religion. Philosophy is our theoretical attitude toward the transcendent, religion is our practical attitude to the same. This distribution of values indicates also the relation of religion and morality. Both are practical attitudes. While the emo- tional may predominate in the one and the volitional in the other, the essential difference is that one is an attitude towards the em- pirical, the other an attitude toward the transcendent. Morality and religion are thus theoretically distinct. Ethics is properly a science as independent of metaphysics in principle as physics or any other science. The interpretation of religion, on the other hand, must be a philosophy. As in the first order of interests we find science, morality, and among others a science of morals, so in the second order of interest we have a philosophy, religion, and among other departments of philosophy a philosophy of religion. Our intellectual interests demand a knowledge of the self and its relation to things, as well as a knowledge of things. And so on the philosophical plane of thought we demand a knowledge not only of reality as a whole, but also of our practical relations to the real. This does not mean that religion is to be subordi- nated to philosophy, but only that a knowledge of religion must be a part of that knowledge which in its entirety constitutes phi- losophy. Hence a twofold necessity for a philosophy of re- ligion.</page><page sequence="9">No. 5-] THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION. 47I (i) Intellectually, philosophy itself to be complete must con- tain an interpretation of religion as at any rate one of the im- portant factors in human life. (2) Practically, religion for its own sake needs a philosophical interpretation. In the case of the natural sciences there is altogether too strong a tendency to regard them as merely means to practical ends. While they have this instrumental value they have also an intrinsic worth. In the midst of the popular adoration of applied science, the thoughtful must preach the value of pure science. In the case of philosophy, however, the general tendency has been in the other direction. Those few who think of philosophy at all look upon it as a subject of pure knowledge, having a mere intellectual worth. I would be the last to disparge this intrinsic value of philosophy, but I believe we need just now to emphasize its in- strumental value. No one of man's great spiritual interests, how- ever worthful in and for itself, can attain to its true dignity until it enters into organic relations with the others and contributes to the abundance of life as a whole. Art for art's sake is a sterile abstraction; art for man's sake is a noble and fruitful ideal. It is in its point of contact with religion that philosophy comes into closest relation with life. Religion is often a storm-center, and the peace-loving philosopher is too much inclined to withdraw as far as possible from its turmoil. But if philosophy is to be a vital discipline, it must not flee the arena of religious strife. Philosophy of religion is, equally with ethics, a normative dis- cipline. We may rightly look to it not merely for an intellectual interpretation, but also, through the interpretation of religion as it is and has been, for the formulation and clarification of standards of value. We may look to it for standards of evaluation by which the thoughtfully minded may give intelligent direction to the expression of religious feeling. Life is more than thought, but thought may serve life. In conclusion, it may be observed that there never was a time in the history of civilization when rational standards of religious value were more needed. Civil and ecclesiastical authorities no longer restrain the idiosyncrasies of the individual religious con- sciousness. Here, as elsewhere, only an intelligent self-mastery</page><page sequence="10">472 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. can prevent liberty from degenerating into license. From the Protestant Reformation down to about the middle of the nine- teenth century, the tendency toward religious variation manifested itself in the formation of new sects based on individual interpreta- tions of the biblical writings. This movement seems now to have spent itself. The new forms of religion which have gained some considerable vogue in the last half century have been based, not on some new interpretation of scriptures, but upon some extra-biblical principle. The most prominent religious move- ments of this new type in this country are Mormonism, Spirit- ualism, Christian Science, and Theosophy. Of course, the pos- session of rational standards of value will not save society from the rank growths that spring from a soil of passion and super- stition. But it is important to note that in the last two religious movements mentioned, Christian Science and Theosophy,' the adherents have been drawn not from the ignorant and unedu- cated, but rather from the class that might be called the half- educated. They are just the class that might be influenced if the intellectual world presented any semblance of unanimity in its standards of religious value. Philosophy is the final court of appeal for the case of Science versus Religion. Just at present the tendency may be for these two to ignore each other and so avoid conflict. But this can be only a temporary phase of the case. Where two such vital inter- ests are concerned, the human spirit will never rest permanently from its efforts to secure a rational adjustment. Our intellectual interpretation of the world, and our religious attitude toward the world cannot be entirely sundered. We may grant that religion in its essence is a mode of feeling, but still the religious con- sciousness has its intellectual aspect. The dogmatic element may be more or less subordinated, but it can never be entirely wanting. I The appearance of theosophy and various forms of orientalism amongst us need not surprise us. ' No action without reaction ' is a law of the social as well as of the physical world. There is no giving without receiving, no exporting without importing. If the west sends its religion to the east, it must feel in return the impulse of eastern re- ligions. It is interesting to observe that theosophy appears to-day under much the same conditions as it appeared in the Hellenic world. In both cases, a western people in a period of philosophical agnosticism is brought into close relations with the east.</page><page sequence="11">No. 5.] THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION. 473 Man cannot feel reverence for, and worship a being, without form- ing some sort of an idea of that being. The same is true, it may be observed, on the moral side. Religion is essentially an emo- tional attitude expressing itself in a form of ritual. But the di- rection and sincerity of his worship cannot but effect a man's attitude toward his neighbor. Creed, cult, and conduct are in- separable aspects of the religious consciousness. To the ana- lytic philosopher, theories of reality and theories of value may seem quite separate and distinct from each other. In real life the two cannot be severed. Of course, the philosopher of religion is not expected to ap- pear as a religious reformer. But it is not too much to ask that he shall point out what is intellectually and morally sound in re- ligion, and thus furnish to those who are ready to act intelligently in religion as well as in other matters a standard of judgment. A working agreement between science and religion, not a mere agreement of non-interference, but a practical harmony, would not only relieve many a troubled soul of a great burden, but would give a tremendous increment to the forces that make for social betterment. Philosophy is no mere affair of the closet. Philosophy is for life. In no way can it more effectively realize its possibilities as a vital discipline than by dealing courageously with the religious problem. F. C. FRENCH.</page></plain_text>
