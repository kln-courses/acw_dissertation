McLeod Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories THE ASSESSMENT of the protection from human head in- jury provided by occupant restraint systems is based on the impact responses of crash dummy heads. For these assess- ments to be meaningful, dummy head responses must be representative of human head responses. To ensure a corres- pondence between human and dummy head responses, speci- fications and requirements based on biomechanical data must be established todiefine dummy head characteristics that are significant to human head injury assessment. In 1972, General Motors initiated a program to build, evalu- ate, and deliver two crash test dummies under contract with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which resulted in the General Motors anthropomorphic test dummy, 50th percentile, design 2 (GMATD 502). This con- tract commitment was supported by the GM in-house dummy development program. As part of this in-house program, re- quirements for a crash dummy head were defined based on existing biomechanical knowledge, and a dummy head was developed to satisfy these requirements. This headform was delivered to NHTSA as part of the GM ATD 502 dummy. This paper presents and discusses the definition, design, de- velopment, and evaluation of this dummy head. Specifically, discussions are given of: 1. The geometric, inertial, and impact response require- ments based on anthropometric and biomechanical data and used in this program. 2. The design rationale and manufacturing techniques employed. 3. The results of a testing program conducted to determine the impact performance of the 502 head for comparison with the biomechanical impact performance requirements, for evaluation of its repeatability and reproducibility of response and for documentation of its response in a wide variety of impact tests other than the biomechanical performance test. DUMMY HEAD REQUIREMENTS GEOMETRIC REQUIREMENTS - The external dimensions of the head, specified in SAE Recommended Practice J963 for a 50th percentile adult male crash test dummy, are head length of 7.7 ± 0.2 in (196 ± 5 mm), head circumference of 22.5 ± 0.5 in (572 ±12 mm), and head breadth of 6.1 ± 0.2 in (155 ± 5 mm). The nominal values of the dimensions are the 50th percentile values from Hertzberg, et al. (1).* The tolerances ensure that the respective dimensions are between the 25th and 75th percentiles of Hertzberg' s sample. *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. ABSTRACT Crash test dummies serve as human surrogates in automotive crash simulations, and accelerations monitored in the heads of these dummies are used for assessment of human head in- jury hazard. For these acceleration measurements to be mean- ingful indicators of head injury, the impact response of the human head must be a part of dummy head design. This paper describes the conception, design, and development of a crash test dummy head. Geometric, inertial, and perfor- mance requirements based on biomechanical information are presented and discussed. The head design concept is compati- ble with current head injury assessment procedures, and the configuration is based on the GM Research skull and head geometry models. The manufacture and development are described, and the test procedures and results are presented and discussed with reference to the biomechanical and func- tional requirements. The resulting dummy head is shown to comply with these requirements. 3836</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1 - Anthropomorphic skull and head geometry models A reduction of these tolerances to ± 0.2 in (5 mm) for head circumference would ensure that the respective dimensions were between the 35th and 65th percentiles of the sample in Ref. 1. Experience derived in the manufacture of dummy heads indicates that these tighter tolerances would not be difficult to attain. It is recommended that a head length of 7.7 ± 0.1 in (196 ± 2.5 mm), breadth of 6.1 ± 0.1 in (155 ± 2.5 mm), and circumference of 22.5 ± 0.2 in (572 ± 5 mm) be used as guidelines for dummy heads representing the aver- age American adult male. Head length, breadth, and circumference do not define the shape of crash dummy heads. As a step toward a more com- plete definition of head geometry, Hubbard and McLeod (2) surveyed available anthropometric data and arrived at geo- metric descriptions for the skull and head that are represen- tative of the average adult American male. In that study, skull landmarks were located in a three-dimensional coordinate scheme, and skull and head geometry models were construc- ted (Fig. 1). These landmark locations and models are a more complete representation of head geometry than exists in any other study. The adoption of these results in their entirety, however, could be misleading and unnecessarily restrictive in crash dummy head design and manufacture. Mimicking the geometry of the human head and skull does not ensure human- like head impact response. The objective is to specify enough geometric characteristics to ensure an acceptable representa- tion of human structure without restricting the attainment of humanlike attributes in nongeometric categories. The coordinate system used for location of significant points in the specification of dummy head geometry is the same as that used in Ref. 2 and is shown in Fig. 2. The origin of the coordinate system is at the nasion (nasal root) of the skull. The head is oriented with its Frankford plane horizontal, the x-direction being in the anterior-posterior (A-P) direction with χ increasing anteriorly; the y-direction being laterally oriented with y increasing to the left of the head; and the z axis being superior-inferior (S-I) with z increasing superiorly.

These two land- marks indicate the locations of the brows and the features of the upper facial region. The gnathion is the most inferior point on the midsagittal plane through the chin. The left and right gonions are the most lateral points on the angle of the mandible. The gnathion and gonions locate the lower margin of the mandible. In addition to the location of these three points, the mandible of the dummy should be an open section when viewed from below so that, under conditions of forward or lateral neck bending, the head first contacts other parts of the dummy near the inferior margin of the jaw. The left and right zygions are the most lateral points on the zygomatic arch protrusions. This pair of landmarks adds to the assur- ance of correct location of the facial features. The landmarks on the midsagittal plane of the face (glabella, nasion, and gnathion) are accompanied by tolerances of ± 0.10 in (± 2.5 mm) or less in each of the three coordinate directions (Table 1) to ensure that these landmarks are located close to their anthropometrically correct positions. The tol- erances for the off-midsagittal plane landmarks on the face (gonions and zygions) are ± 0.10 in (± 2.5 mm) in the lateral direction and ± 0.20 in (± 5.1 mm) in the other directions to ensure correct facial width without unduly restricting dummy design. The vertex and the posterior pole are landmarks at the su- perior and posterior extremes, respectively, on the midsagittal section of the braincase. The left and right euryons are the lateral extremes of the braincase. The tolerances on the vertex and posterior pole confine the locations of these landmarks to be near to the midsagittal plane and close to the anthropo- metrically correct positions in the respective radial directions, but a relatively large tolerance-! 0.30 in (± 7.6 mm)- is allowed in the respective tangential directions in the midsagittal plane. The euryons are restricted to ± 0.10 in (± 2.5 mm) in the lateral (radial) direction. The tolerances for the euryons in the direc- tions tangent to the head surface are relatively large-! 0.30 in (! 7.6 mm). The head circumference, landmark locations, and associated tolerances specified above are guides for the design of the ex- ternal surface of crash dummy heads. Additional geometric specifications are necessary for location of significant points on the skull and for demarcation of the remainder of the body. The study of Hubbard and McLeod (2) provides a large num- ber of landmark locations for the human skull which could be repeated here for use in definitive dummy head specifications. To do this would be unduly restrictive to dummy head design. Only three landmarks on the hard skeletal structure of the head will be specified here (see Table 2 and Fig. 2). Although the crash dummy head presented in this paper and most other heads in present use are hollow aluminum struc- tures covered by pliable plastic skins, dummy heads of the future may be constructed in other ways. For dummy heads of the present configuration, the points specified to be inter- nal to the dummy head should be interpreted as points lying on the stiff dummy skull structure. For dummy heads of a configuration other than the one currently used, the internal points are more difficult to interpret. They should be points of resistance to deformation, which are relatively high com-</page><page sequence="4">CRASH DUMMY HEAD 3839 Table 2 - Internal Geometry Related to 50th Percentile Male Dummy Heads Landmark Coordinates, in(mm) Point χ y z Nasion 0.00 0.00 0.00 Gnathion 0.10 ± 0.10 0.00 ± 0.05 -4.80 ±0.10 (2.54 ± 2.5) (0.00 ±1.3) ( 1 2 1 .9 ± 2.5) Occipital condylar axis -3.70 0.00 -2.40 (-94) (-61) pared to resistance to deformation of the dummy head in general. The location of the nasion as specified in Table 2 is the origin of the coordinate system used in this paper and is consistent with Ref. 2. The gnathion is the midpoint of the lower margin of the human mandible and locates this relatively stiff structure, which may load the chest during extreme neck flexion. Com- parison of internal locations of the nasion and gnathion with the nominal location of the respective external surface land- marks indicates skin thicknesses of 0.30 in (7.6 mm) with maxima of 0.50 in (12.7 mm) in both cases. These skin thick- nesses are consistent with the soft tissue thicknesses of humans in these areas, and they should be appropriate for dummy heads of the skull-skin type of construction. The occipital condylar axis, as located in Table 2 and shown in Fig. 2, is the center of rotation of the atlanto occipital joint, which includes the occipital condyles of the skull. This axis should be interpreted as the uppermost extent of human neck mobility. The mobility of the neck structure attached to a dummy head is one of the prime determinants of head-neck- upper thorax kinematics. Unfortunately, no specifications are currently available for this motion, so that specified location of the occipital condylar axis can only stand as a guide for dummy neck placement relative to the head. The part of the dummy that is to be considered the head must be defined if many of the characteristics of the head are to be specified and discussed objectively. Many researchers have found it necessary to differentiate the human head from the remainder of the body (3-7). Demarcation of the head is commonly described as starting at the rear base of the skull, proceeding through the neck along the occipital bone of the skull, through the atlantooccipital joint to the margin of the mandible, and along the margin to the front of the neck. Us- ing this description as a guide and Ref. 2 as a basis, a defini- tive demarcation for 50th percentile male adult dummy heads has been specified and is shown in Fig. 2. This demarca- tion is necessary in specifying realistic inertial requirements for dummy heads. INERTIAL PROPERTIES - The human head has been con- sidered to be a single rigid body for development of computer models of human impact kinematics and for dummy develop- ment. Inertial properties of the head have been measured from this point of view by several investigators (3-8), and these data provide a basis for specification of the weight, e.g. loca- tion, and mass moment of inertia about a lateral axis through the e.g. for the head of an average adult American male. The fact that the human head is not a rigid body and the effects this fact has on the responses determined from computer models and dummy testing await future study. The cadaver heads used by Hodgson, et al. (7), and heads from cadavers numbered 1820, 1848, 1875, and 1861 of Hodg- son and Thomas (8) are a sample of 1 1 heads that are consis- tent with the length, breadth, and circumference requirements presented previously in this paper. The average weight of these heads was 10.0 lb (4.54 kg). The results from driving point impedance studies of the human head (9, 10) consis- tently show that the head responds like a 10.0 lb (4.54 kg) mass at low driving frequencies, which supports the weights measur- ed by Hodgson. Walker, et al. (3), measured and reported anthropometric characteristics and inertial properties of 20 cadaver heads. The mass moments of inertia about a lateral axis through the e.g. were measured for all but three of these heads (cadavers 3029, 3142, and 3328). One of the remaining 17 heads (cadaver 3121) was extremely large (length of 9.9 in (251 mm) and breadth of 7.3 in (185 mm)) but weighed only 9.1 lb (4.13 kg). Because this head was over 2 in (5 1 mm) longer and 1 in (25 mm) wider than the mean values of length and breadth from the Walker sample, and yet weighed less than the average weight of that sample, data from it were inappropriate for use in this paper. Considering the data from the remaining 16 cadavers, the mean head length and breadth were 7.7 in (196 mm) and 6.2 in (157 mm), re- spectively, which corresponds closely to average values of these dimensions for adult males. The average head weight for these 16 cadavers was 9.9 lb (4.49 kg). In an effort to determine the weight distribution of the human body, a phantóm was made by filling the 50th per- centile dummy master body-form ("golden shell") with a human skeleton of appropriate size and material of similar density to the respective tissues of the body (11). When the head of this phantom was sectioned according to SAE Rec- ommended Practice J963, a head weight of 1 1.55 lb (5.24 kg) was measured. Later the phantom was sectioned in close agreement with the head demarcation given in Fig. 2, and a head weight of 9.95 lb (4.5 1 kg) was measured (6). Without exception, these experimental results support a specification of 10.0 lb (4.54 kg) for the weight of an aver-</page><page sequence="5">3840 R. P. HUBBARD AND D. G. MCLEOD age adult male head as delineated in Fig. 2. The reasonable tolerance on this value is ± 0.1 lb (± 0.04 kg), considering dummy head ballasting techniques and the potential effects of variability in head impact response due to weight differ- ences. In the anthropometry chapter of Ref. 12, the results of head e.g. measurements by Walker, et al. (3), and Becker (4) are presented and discussed. Ewing (12) selected the average value of e.g. location coordinates determined by Walker, et al. When this e.g. is expressed in terms of the coordinate system of the present study, its location is 3.00 in (76.2 mm) posterior and 0.50 in (12.7 mm) inferior of the origin, so that its χ, y, and z coordinates are -3.00 in, 0.00 in, and -0.50 in (-76.2 mm, 0.0 mm, -12.7 mm). Mertz (5) measured the inertial properties of two decapi- tated cadaver heads. One was considerably larger than the average adult male, and the other was considerably smaller. From these two heads, he developed guidelines for estimat- ing e.g. locations of live volunteers or intact cadavers. Using these guidelines, the location of the e.g. of the 50th percen- tile adult male is 0.50 in (12.7 mm) superior and 0.10 in (2.5 mm) posterior of that determined by Walker, et al. The location for the e.g. of the head determined from the second sectioning scheme of the 50th percentile golden-shell phan- tom (6) lies 0.10 in (2.5 mm) inferior and 0.30 in (7.6 mm) posterior of that determined by Walker, et al. The sample used by Walker, et al. (3), is the largest sample of human cadaver heads sectioned in the manner consistent with this paper. For this reason, their data can be used with confidence in specifying head e.g. location. Based on the data of Walker, et al., the e.g. of the average adult male head as delineated in the present study is located at a point 0.50 in (12.7 mm) inferior and 3.00 in (76.2 mm) posterior of the origin of the coordinate system used in the present study. Considering manufacturing and ballasting practices, the e.g. of a crash dummy head should lie within 0.05 in (1.3 mm) of this location. Mertz (5) measured the mass moment of inertia of two cadaver heads about a lateral axis through the e.g. of each one. Proportionality constants were then determined between the radii of gyration of the heads and their length, breadth, and circumference. These proportionality constants were nearly equal for the respective dimensions of the two heads. This approach was applied to the data from the previously mentioned 16 cadaver heads reported by Walker, et al. (3). The resulting proportionality constants relating head length and breadth to radius of gyration about a lateral axis through the e.g. were both found to be within 4.0% of those calculated by Mertz (5). Based on 16 cadaver heads of Walker, et al., and two of Mettz, the mean ratio of radius of gyration to head length is 0.367 with a coefficient of variation of 5.2%; a mean ratio of radius of gyration to head breadth is 0.462 with a coefficient of variation of 6.2%. These ratios are essentially invariant for head lengths ranging from 7.2-8.3 in (182.9-210. 8 mm) and head breadths from 5.7-6.8 in (144.8-172.7 mm). When these ratios are used in conjunction with the mean head length and breadth for adult males (7.7 (195.6) and 6.1 in (154.9 mm), respectively), the resulting radii of gyration are 2.82 (71.63) and 2.83 in (71.88 mm), respectively, leading to a mass moment of inertia about a lateral axis through the e.g. 0.206 in-lb s2 (0.00237 m-kg s2) and 0.207 in-lb s2 (0.00238 m-kg s2 ), respectively. Based on these results, a realistic value of mass moment of inertia about a lateral axis through the e.g. of an average adult male head is 0.207 in-lb s2 (0.00238 m-kg s2). This value, with a tolerance of ± 0.01 in-lb s2 (0.001 m-kg s2), should be used as a requirement for 50th percentile adult male crash dummy heads. BIOMECHANICAL PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT - Dummy heads are subjected to two types of loading during crash tests: loads transmitted through the neck attachments, and loads that develop between the dummy head and im- pacted objects. The neck attachment loads are present in varying degrees for all cases of dummy usage. The character- istics of a dummy head that affect its response when sub- jected to loads transmitted only through the dummy neck are head weight, e.g. location, and mass moment of inertia. These characteristics are specified above for head motion in the midsagittal plane. Compliance with these specifications assures humanlike dummy head response to forces trans- mitted through the neck attachment in the midsagittal plane. When a dummy head contacts an object during a crash test, forces develop in the region of contact between the impacted object and the dummy head, in addition to the forces trans- mitted to the head at the neck attachment. Among the im- portant factors affecting these contact forces are the inertial properties of the head, which also influence the head response under neck loading alone. Other important factors are the contours and load-deflection characteristics of the contacting regions of the head and the impacted object, and the coupling characteristics between the head and the torso provided by the neck structure. The head injury assessment procedures being used in con- junction with FMVSS 208 are based on measurement of the linear acceleration at the e.g. of a dummy head. This proced- ure implies that the dummy head should be essentially a rigid body and that the only head deformation occurring under impact is confined to the region of contact with the impacted object. The remainder of the head is undeformed and responds like a rigid body to sense the acceleration response of the head to the forces developed between the head and the impacted object, and to the forces transmitted through the neck to the head. A dummy head design must reflect these implications if it is to be used for head injury assessment in the context of FMVSS 20. Hodgson and Thomas (7) dropped cadavers so that their heads struck a stiff load cell mounted to a massive base. The cadaver heads were not decapitated for testing, and the re- sults indicate that significant loads did not develop in the neck to constrain the head until after the measured head accelerations had reached a maximum and returned to nearly zero. The head-neck coupling had little effect on peak accel- erations measured on a cadaver head during impact with a stiff, flat, and massive surface.</page><page sequence="6">CRASH DUMMY HEAD 3841 # Forehead impact Same head from different heights O Mean cadaver response J Dummy forehead impact performance requirement 400 r 0 300 ~ ρ y - Mean forehead impact response 1 υ / · Y ± y υ / · ± 0 y ^ 200 - / y · ^ ^ s · · LU 1 ·" ^ Ř 100 " ce UJ Ω- Ο LĄ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 i 5 6 7 8 9 10 II 12 13 14 IMPACT VELOCITY (ft/sec) (X 0.305 for m/sec) Fig. 3 - Cadaver forehead impact response (7) and dummy head performance requirement The Hodgson-Thomas cadaver head impact data were the only information available when the 502 head drop test re- sponse requirement was written. Based on six forehead im- pact tests, they reported mean values of 250 £ resultant peak head acceleration at 8.9 ft/s (2.71 m/s), which corresponds to a free-fall height of 14.8 in (0.376 m). They also reported the responses of two cadaver heads, each tested at different drop heights. These responses are shown in Fig. 3 with the dummy head response requirements. Although the scatter in these data is broad, it was necessary to define a range of response for dummy heads that would give some assurance that the accelerations measured in dummy heads during an impact event would be similar to those measured in a human head during the same event. The mean forehead impact response reported by Hodgson and Thomas was chosen as the midpoint of the biomechanical performance requirement, with an allowable variation from that midpoint of 10% (25 g ). When a dummy head is tested in accordance with the drop test procedure described in the Testing and Evaluation section, the peak resultant acceleration measured at the head e.g. should be between 225-275 g for an impact velocity of 8.9 ft/s (2.71 m/s). GM ATD 502 HEAD DEVELOPMENT DESIGN DESCRIPTION - The geometric, inertial, and per- formance requirements are of little significance unless they are incorporated into a usable dummy head. In recent years, the dummy heads used predominantly within General Motors have been modifications of the Sierra 1050 head. The Hybrid I head was a 1050 head with the nose of the aluminum skull ground off and nominal specifications on forehead skin thickness. The Hybrid II head was a further modification of the 1050 head with its base plane raised and chin region made into an open section. The GMR-1 head differed from the Hybrid II head in that its base plane was raised farther and the chin section relocated as steps toward agreement with recently available anthropometric information. The GMR-1 forehead skin thickness was specified to be 0.40 in (10.2 mm) in an effort to attain humanlike impact response. Al- though it was possible for modified Sierra 1050 heads to comply with many of the design and performance require- ments presented in this paper, there were two basic short- comings that necessitated the development of the 502 head: the skin thickness of the Sierra 1050 head was not uniform, and the skull structure was not symmetrical about the mid- sagittal plane. Like the Sierra 1050 head and its modifications, the 502 head is an aluminum shell covered by a pliable vinyl skin. The interior of the shell is a cavity accommodating instrumenta- tion and ballast, with access provided by removal of a back cap. This configuration was chosen for the following reasons: 1. It was compatible with the implications of FMVSS 208, discussed in the previous section. 2. Past experience has shown that skull resonance can be re- duced to acceptable levels with this configuration. 3. Past experience could be used to select a skin thickness to obtain the desired impact performance. 4. The utility of this configuration has been demonstrated through extensive use of heads of the same basic configuration. MANUFACTURE - The geometry requirements mentioned earlier were based on a study (2) in which a model was con- structed to represent the average male adult skull. The pro- minent bone structures of the human face are relatively frail when compared to other cranial bones. When simulating these facial structures with a nonfrangible dummy head, their prominence should be reduced to improve impact fidelity, as well as repeatability. The geometric configuration of the 502 dummy head was based on a skull geometry model modified to reduce the prominence of the facial structures. The skull geometry model and the modified model are shown in Fig. 4. In order that skin thickness and head symmetry would be well controlled, master patterns for the skull and skin of the 502 head were machined using numerically controlled mills. To obtain the data for the milling instructions, the left side of the modified skull model was scanned twice using spherical probes of 1.00 (25.4) and 1.90 in (48.3 mm) diameters. From these data, five master patterns were made (Fig. 5). A 1 in (25.4 mm) spherical cutter was used with the 1 in (25.4 mm) probe data to duplicate the surface of the skull model and form the surfaces of the skull master pattern and the back cap master pattern. The right-hand sides of these patterns were milled by changing the sign of the lateral coordinate, assuring symmetry about the midsagittal plane. To complete the skull master, the chin region was milled out, the base was milled flat and parallel to the Frankfort plane, a skin retention groove was milled in the back surface, and marks were added to in- dicate the proper location of the e.g. of the head. The back cap master was finished by adding skin retention grooves, e.g. location marks, and machining setup steps.</page><page sequence="7">3842 R. P. HUBBARD AND D. G. MCLEOD Fig. 4 - Skull geometry model and modified model for GM ATD 502 head configuration. Fig. 5 - Master patterns for GM ATD 502 dummy head A 1.5 in (38.1 mm) diameter spherical cutter was used with the 1 in (25.4 mm) probe data to mill the surfaces of the skull core and back cap core masters. The 1.5 in (38.1 mm) cutter milled a surface that was 0.25 in (6.4 mm) inside the exterior surface of the skull core and back cap masters. The skull core master and back cap core master were finished by machining flanges for back cap attachment screws. Drop testing of Sierra 1050 heads and modifications of the 1050 head with a range of skin thicknesses provided data for selection of a nominal skin thickness of 0.45 in (1 1.4 mm) to obtain the desired drop test response of the dummy head. Using a 1.0 in (25.4 mm) spherical cutter with the data from the 1.9 in (48.3 mm) probe, the surface of the skin master pattern was milled at a constant distance of 0.45 in (1 1.4 mm) outside the skull master pattern surface.

ASTM S5A aluminum was originally selected for these castings because this material showed the least tendency to resonate in similar skull con- figurations. However, ASTM S5A alloy is a low-yield-strength alloy, and the skulls made of it deformed under normal usage. The skull material was changed to 356 aluminum casting alloy with T-6 heat treatment, and skull deformation was no longer a problem. These castings were finished by machining flat surfaces and drilling, tapping, and inserting helicoils for accelero meter, back cap, and neck mounting. A finished skull is shown in Fig. 6. A 356 aluminum skin mold was made in three sections from the skin master pattern. A finished skull and back cap were mounted inside the skin mold cavity to act as the core of the skin mold. A nose protrusion was placed on the front of this skull so that the nose skin would have a cavity. Prototype skins were produced at Sierra Engineering using the same molding procedure as was used on their 1050 dummy skins. In an effort to understand and develop the skin molding process, final skin molding was done at GM Research Labora- tories. To reduce relative motion between the skull and the skin under impact conditions, rubber plugs were inserted through the skin and skull in three places on each side óf the head. A finished 502 dummy head with skin in place is shown in Fig. 6. TESTING AND EVALUATION Several GM ATD 502 dummy heads have been manufactured during the testing and development of the head and the fully assembled 502 dummy. The results presented and discussed in this section were obtained with the most recent 502 heads available when this paper was written. These results will be used to demonstrate compliance of the 502 heads with the geometric, inertial, and biomechanical performance require- ments, which have been the goals throughout the design and development program, and to document the 502 head response in a comprehensive set of supplemental tests. COMPLIANCE WITH GEOMETRIC AND INERTIAL RE- QUIREMENTS - Comparisons of measurements taken on a 502 head with the geometric requirements presented previously in this paper indicate that the various landmarks on the skull and skin surfaces are all within 0.10 in (2.54 mm) of the nominal specified locations, and that the heads are symmetri- cal about the mid-sagittal plane within 0.05 in (1.3 mm). The skin thicknesses over the braincase regions of the 502 heads are nominally 0.44 in (1 1.2 mm) and vary less than 0.03 in (0.8 mm). The 502 head has been used with accelerometer installations at the e.g., including relatively bulky triaxial packs of three single-axis accelerometers and more compact triaxial accelero- meters. In addition to these installations, accelerometers have been mounted to the front and rear surfaces of the skull cavity. In all cases, the 502 heads were made to comply with the specified values for inertial properties through conventional ballasting procedures. DROP TEST PROCEDURE - Drop testing of dummy heads onto a rigid, flat surface was chosen as an assessment method of dummy head mechanical performance for two reasons: 1 . The response of the head to this test depends almost entirely on the characteristics of the head so that differences in head response are primarily due to differences in head char- acteristics. 2. The response of dummy heads to this test can be corn- Fig. 6 - GM ATD 502 skull and head assembly</page><page sequence="9">3844 R. P. HUBBARD AND D. G. MCLEOD pared with the response of cadaver heads under similar test con- ditions to establish the correspondence of dummy and human head impact responses. The drop test procedure for forehead impact is as follows: 1. The head is suspended in the configuration shown in Fig. 7 for forehead impact. 2. The center of the impact region is located at the inter- section of the midsagittal plane and a plane paralled to the bottom surface of the head 2 in (50.8 mm) below the top of the head. This impact site is comparable to the site selected for forehead impacts by Hodgson and Thomas (7). 3. Free-fall drops are made on a rigidly supported flat steel plate at least 2 in (50.8 mm) thick and 24 in (610 mm) square, from the designated height measured from intended point of impact on the head to the plate. For the 502 head impact tests reported in this paper, one accelerometer package was used in conjunction with the same signal conditioning equipment. This accelerometer package was an aluminum block with three Endevco 7231 piezoresis- tive single-axis accelerometers mounted orthogonally; it was identical to the accelerometer package delivered to NHTSA with the 502 dummies. During the dummy head impact tests, the three components of linear acceleration at the head e.g. were measured, amplified, and recorded on tape. Digital signal processing was used to filter at SAE J21 1 a channel class 1000, calculate head injury assessment numbers, and produce graphic data displays. COMPLIANCE WITH BIOMECHANICAL PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT - Three 502 skulls and ten skins were as- sembled in various combinations and drop tested from a height of 14.8 in (0.376 m) following the procedure described above. The results of these tests were used to determine compliance with the biomechanical performance requirements and the re- peatability and reproducibility of the 502 head response. The 10 skins evaluated for this paper are essentially the same as the skins delivered to NHTSA. In preliminary testing with these skins, peak resultant accelerations were within the bio- mechanical requirement and near 250 g. After a period of three months, resultant peak accelerations were in the 280 g range, which was attributed to stiffening of the vinyl skins with time. As a result of a series of tests to understand the 502 head response better, the friction at the skin-skull inter- face was identified as an important factor. Reduced friction was associated with decreased head acceleration. To control the friction on the skin surfaces and attain head response in compliance with the biomechanical performance requirement, the skins were washed thoroughly with soap and water, and talcum powder was applied to the inside skin sur- face. The aluminum skulls and the steel impact surface were cleaned with methyl ethyl ketone. A series of tests was also run in which the exterior surface of the skin was coated with Fig. 7 - Dummy head drop test</page><page sequence="10">CRASH DUMMY HEAD 3845 a chalk paint, commonly used by the GM Proving Ground, to determine its effect on measured head accelerations (see Supplemental Drop Tests). Three 502 head assemblies were each drop tested six times from a height of 14.8 in (0.376 m). A typical response is shown in Fig. 8. The results are summarized in Table A-l in the Appendix and presented graphically in Fig. 9. The values of peak resultant acceleration ranged from 239-262 g and were well within the biomechanical performance requirement of 225-275 g. The coefficients of variation (standard deviation divided by mean) for each head assembly were 1.6% or less, which demonstrates very good repeatability. When the data from the three head assemblies were pooled, the mean value of peak resultant acceleration was 253 g with a coefficient of variation of 2.5%, which indicates good reproducibility for that sample.

Pooling the data, the overall mean was 740 with a coefficient of variation of 4.1%. These data demon- strate the good repeatability and reproducibility of 502 head response in the biomechanical performance test. Ten 502 head skins were available for this study, and they were each drop tested three times using a single skull. The results are summarized in Table A- 2 of the Appendix. The mean values of peak resultant acceleration for each skin ranged from 246-262 g with a maximum coefficient of vari- ation of 2.4%. The mean value of the pooled data was 256 g with a 2.3% coefficient of variation. The significant conclu- sion from these results is that response within the biomechani- cal performance requirement can be obtained with the 502 head with very little variation from skin to skin. Three 502 skulls were drop tested three times each using the same skin. The results are summarized in Table A-3 of the Appendix. The mean peak resultant accelerations ranged from 252-260 g with a maximum coefficient of variation of 2.4%. The mean of the pooled data was 257 g with a 2.0% coefficient of variation indicating very good reproducibility of skull response. The impact sites for the results given above were controlled to be in compliance with the drop test procedure. To de- termine the response to impacts near that site, a 502 head was dropped three times from 14.8 in (0.376 m) onto sites 1 in (25.4 mm) to either side of 1 in (25.4 mm) above the standard impact site (arc distance on the skin surface). The results are summarized in Table A-4 in the Appendix. The mean values of peak resultant acceleration ranged from 249- 261 g with a maximum coefficient of variation of 1.4%. These results demonstrate that the response of the 502 head is in- sensitive to variations of 1 in to the side or above the standard forehead impact site. The results of drop testing various combinations of ten skins and three skulls from 14.8 in (0.376 m) with forehead impact demonstrates that the response of the 502 head under these conditions complies with the biomechanical performance re- quirement and is highly repeatable and reproducible. The present understanding of human head response to impact is not a sufficient basis for assurance that the responses of dummy heads are generally representative of human head re- sponses. The responses of the 502 head to direct impact con- ditions, other than those in the biomechanical performance requirement, are nof necessarily representative of human response. SUPPLEMENTAL DROP TESTS - A 502 head was dropped from 6 (0.152) and 10 in (0.254 m) onto a clean, cold-rolled steel plate in a manner identical to the biomechanical per- formance test, except for the drop height. In a second series, the same head was dropped in the same manner from 6 (0.152), 10 (0.254), and 14.8 in (0.376 m) with a chalk paint applied to the forehead, commonly used in crash testing at the GM Proving Ground. The results of these tests are summarized in Table A-5 in the Appendix and in Fig. 10. The coefficients of variation for these tests were low, ranging from 0.5-2.7%. The average peak resultant accelerations were lowered by 5 g</page><page sequence="11">3846 R. P. HUBBARD AND D. G. MCLEOD or less by the presence of chalk paint on the skin surface. These results indicate that this chalk paint does not signifi- cantly alter the 502 head response to forehead impact. A 502 head was subjected to three replications of drop tests from heights of 10 (0.254) and 14.8 in (0.376 m) with impact to the sides and rear and from 14.8 in (0.376 m) with impacts to the face. For the impacts to the sides of the head, the base plane was vertical and the midsagittal plane was horizontal and parallel to the steel impact surface. For impacts to the rear of the head, both the base plane and the midsagittal plane of the head were vertical and perpendicular to the impact sur- face. The results of impacts to the sides and rear of the head are summarized in Table A-6 in the Appendix and are shown in Fig. 1 1 with comparable results for forehead impacts. The differences between the average accelerations from impacts to either side of the head were small, 2.0% at 10 in (0.254 m) and 4.6% at 14.8 in (0.376 m). The accelerations resulting from impact to the side of the head were significantly lower than for forehead impact, and the accelerations from impact to the rear of the head were significantly higher than from forehead impact. For facial impact, the 502 head was dropped from 14.8 in (0.376 m) with the base plane vertical and perpendicular to the impact surface and the midsagittal plane either vertical or tilted 45 deg to the left or right. For the direct facial impact, the point of first contact was the hollow nose pro- trusion followed by contact with the lips and chin. For the angled facial impacts, contact occurred at the lateral anterior prominence of the zygomatic area and the lateral ridge of the orbital area. The results of these tests are summarized in Table A-7 of the Appendix. The average of the peak resultant accelerations resulting from direct facial impact was 59 g and was much lower than comparable results from other impact sites. This low level of acceleration response is due to the nose and lip protrusions. The mean values of peak resultant acceleration from angled facial impacts were nearly identical (238 g for the left side and 239 g for the right side), and they were approximately 10# lower than comparable results from forehead impact. When the heads of dummies or cadavers impact glass in crash tests, the heads are loaded, and upon glass breakage, the load is abruptly released. This abrupt load release often in- duces head resonance, which appears on the acceleration-time records. Examples of windscreen impacts for cadaver heads were reported by Hodgson, et al. (13), and for dummy im- pacts by Kay, et al. (14). Comparison between these re- sponses indicates that the acceleration oscillations measured in the dummy head used by Kay, et al., were larger in magni- tude and persisted for a longer time than similar oscillations measured on cadaver heads by Hodgson, et al., under similar test conditions. The tendency for dummy heads to resonate to a greater degree than cadaver heads has also been docu- mented by Hodgson and Thomas (7) and Stalnaker, et al. (15). To document its response to abrupt load release, a 502 head was dropped from 48 in (1 .2 19 m) through a tempered glass automobile side window.

The acceleration records indicated resonance at 15,000 Hz, which was attributed to accelerometer assembly ringing. To verify this supposition and obtain data that were representative of the 502 head without accelerometer assembly resonance, a 502 head was instrumented with an Endevco 2223D triaxial accelerometer and was subjected to three rep- lications of the glass breakage test. The signals were recorded and digitally processed, with SAE J21 la channel class 1000 filtering, in the same manner as the data from the previous tests. The component and resultant acceleration histories are shown in Fig. 12 from one of the glass breakage tests. Although the glass broke at different levels of impact for each test, the pat- tern of response was very similar for these tests. During most of the first millisecond after contact, the head was smoothly decelerated in the midsagittal plane as in impact with the steel plate. At about 0.8 ms after initial contact, glass breakage oc- curred, followed by abrupt load release. The x-axis (A-P) acceleration response was a nearly sinusoidal oscillation with a frequency of 4000 Hz and an initial peak of 50 g , which de- cayed to 1 5 g in 1 ms and 5 g in 2 ms. The y-axis (LAT) ac- celeration oscillated at 4000 Hz with peaks of 1 5 g or less for 1 ms and then it decayed. The z-axis (S-I) acceleration oscil- lated with a peak of 40 g in 1 ms after load release followed by rapid decay. The resultant acceleration oscillated after glass breakage with peaks of 60 g or less in 1 ms, peaks of 20 g or less in 2 ms, and subsequent decay. The peak resultant acceleration occurred just prior to glass breakage and was 134#; the HIC was 66. In all three replications of this test, the HIC calculation procedure selected the initial acceleration pulse and included none of the resonance. Although Hodgson, et al. (13), have published the responses of cadaver heads to glass breakage, there are no biomechanical data generated under conditions directly comparable to the conditions used in this study. A biomechanical performance requirement for the response of dummy heads to abrupt load release cannot be specified until such data are available. The GM contract with NHTSA for the 502 dummy included a head drop test from 35 in (0.889 m) onto a rigid, flat sur- face with forehead impact. The resultant acceleration mea- sured in the head shojild be unimodal, with oscillations occur- ring after the main pulse being less than 5% of the main pulse. The response of a 502 head to this test, as shown in Fig. 13, complies with the requirement. The peak resultant accelera- tion was 498 g (HIC of 3130), and subsequent oscillations were well below 5% of the peak (25 g). A flat-plate impact of this severity is well above the fracture tolerance for human skulls (7), so that the response of a dummy head to these conditions has little biomechanical significance. This test is an indicator of dummy head resonance, but it is much less severe in this respect than the abrupt load release in a glass breakage test. The 35 in (0.889 m) drop may also be thought of as a proof test, in that a dummy head surviving it will 100 - _25θΙ_ ^ - Glass breakage ~ 50 Γ ćn -g 0 1 - A/4-W» J* L-_J ζ 0 Ρ -SOL 1 *r o Ξ δ o - -Ł - » -Ł. - 1 -loo·- 150p Glass breakage i:: L· U-1 0 1 2-3 4 5 6 TIME (msec) Fig. 12 - Acceleration components and resultant from 502 head dropped from 48 in (1.219 m) through tempered glass automobile side window 500 ρ Λ 400 - Ι ' σι 11 o 11 £ 300 - I ļ QU 11 uj I I LU |ļ 0 II LU II 1 200 - I ļ 11 LU J 1 I I 100 " / I Q r ι ι 0 12 3 4 5 TIME (msec) Fig. 13 - Resultant acceleration from 502 head dropped 35 in (0.89 m) onto rigid, flat surface with forehead impact</page><page sequence="13">3848 R. P. HUBBARD AND D. G. MCLEOD probably not be damaged under normal usage. Because it is a much more severe condition than a human could tolerate, this test could eliminate a dummy head that would perform acceptably at impact levels on the border of human tolerance. During the supplemental testing, the 502 head was period- ically subjected to the biomechanical performance test, and the peak resultant accelerations ranged from 247-258 £. Throughout the two-month test program, the 502 heads con- sistently complied with the biomechanical performance re- quirement. If 502 heads are used in crash testing, their re- sponses should be controlled and maintained to be in compli- ance with the biomechanical performance requirement. CONCLUSIONS 1. The GM ATD 502 dummy head satisfies those biomechan- ical requirements presented in this paper. 2. The responses of the 502 head are highly repeatable and reproducible under a wide variety of test conditions. 3. The biomechanical requirements assure that certain geo- metric, inertial, and mechanical performance characteristics of dummy heads are representative of an average adult male. 4. These requirements are extensive, but they are only necessary for biomechanical fidelity. Compliance of a dummy head with them is not sufficient to assure humanlike responses to general impact environments, such as impact to the sides or rear. 5. The insufficiency of the biomechanical requirements is primarily due to the lack of biomechanical knowledge. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. The GM ATD 502 dummy head should be used in auto- motive crash testing to represent an average adult male head. 2. The responses of the 502 head should be used for human injury assessments with a thorough understanding that the correspondence between dummy and human head responses is limited to forehead impact of short duration. 3. The requirements presented in this paper should be used as a basis for design and evaluation of dummy heads repre- senting the average adult male. 4. Research should be supported and pursued to gain a better understanding of the mechanical and physiological responses of human heads to impact. 5. The definitions and techniques of human head simulation should be expanded and refined to improve the validity of injury assessment procedures.
