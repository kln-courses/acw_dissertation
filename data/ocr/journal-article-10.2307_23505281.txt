<plain_text><page sequence="1">JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THIRD CENTURY A. MARMORSTEIN, London I RABBI Simon ben Lakish, who taught in Tiberias about 250250 C.E., once raised his voice on behalf of the פושעי ישראל, Jewish transgressors, or Apostates. Neither the occasion nor the meaning of the defence of these peculiar people has been properly investigated, and yet, no doubt, for more than one reason, it deserves illumination. In so doing I am not guided by apologetic tendencies, but hope to contribute some details which should throw light on the darkness covering the relations between early Christianity and Judaism. Let us first turn to the saying of R. Simon ben Lakish. It reads: אין אור של גיהנם שולטת בפושעי ישראל קל וחומר ממזבח הזהב, מה מזבח הזהב שאין עליו אלא כעובי דינר זהב כמה שנים אין האור שולטת בו, פושעי ישראל שמלאין מצות כרמון דכתיב כפלח ברמון רקתך, אל תקרי רקתך אלא רקנין שבך על אחת כמה וכסה : The fire of Gehenna has no dominion over the Jewish apostates. This is a conclusion1 a minori ad majus. If for so many years the fire had no rule over the golden altar which did not contain more gold than the thickness of a dinar, how much more the Jewish apostates, who are as full of Mizwot (commandments) as a pomegranate, as it is written:2 "Thy temples are like a piece of pomegranate!" i. e. the empty ones in Israel are full of observances; consequently Gehenna cannot have power over them. What induced this teacher to exempt the Apostates from the fire of Hell? Where did these Apostates "full of observances like a pomegranate" live and flourish? What does Rabbinic literature record of these Apostates in other sources and places? Finally, can one locate them in literary sources outside Jewish literature? 1 B. Idag. 27a, b. 'Erubin 19a. ' Cant. 4.3. The preacher understood רקתך the empty one, i. e., as in Cant. r. ad. 10c: הריקן שבכם רצוף מצות כרסון הזה ואין צריך לומר מבעד לצמתן על הצנועין והמצומחין שבכם. 223</page><page sequence="2">224 A. MARMORSTEIN [2] These questions involve more than an idle inquiry into a more or less uninteresting episode of the past. They reveal an instruc tive attitude of the Rabbis towards intellectual and religious movements and developments, which are not without significance, and should serve as guidance in the problems facing us at present. To begin with, there are many, favorable and unfavorable, references to the Posh'e Israel. The author of Psalm 51.15 aims at teaching transgressors (פושעים) God's ways, and hopes to convert sinners (חטאים). Sinners and transgressors belong together. In the book of the prophet Isaiah (1.28) they are included in the company of those that forsake the Lord ('עוזבי ה). Ps. 37.38 groups them together with the wicked (רשעים). Both are opposed to the righteous in the next verse. Similarly in Hos. 14.10. We can, however, derive only very scanty information about the nature of these different groups. In the period of the Hasmoneans the פושעי בתורה, the transgressors against the Torah, must have been well-known, highly detested figures in the then small commonwealth of Judea.3 The School of Hillel opened the gates of the schools to all who longed to enter, for many transgressors had been in Israel who, through learning, drew nearer to the Torah and became ancestors of pious and righteous men.4 The two schools also took another opportunity to discuss the final destiny of the Posh'e Israel.5 R. Simon ben Lakish seems to contradict unequivocally the views of those schools, who condemn them to Gehenna, when he says: Gehenna has no rule over them! This is remarkable! Further, they do not draw a line between פושעי ישראל and פושעי או"ה, Jewish and gentile apostates. The same designations occur in a sentence of R. Eliezer ben Hyrkanos.6 Finally, the Apostates together with the Minim figure in the special benediction of the Amidah, which similarly proves the existence of these people in the first century.7 Apart from the bare names of these Posh'e Israel and Posh'e ummot ha-olam, very little information can be gained from our sources.

Nebat on the other side. The Posh'e Israel must therefore be distinguished from these eight more serious and dangerous categories of sinners. None of the characteristic faults and shortcomings of these eight groups applies to the trans gressors. They are neither Minim in any sense, nor informers on their fellowmen. They do not belong to antinomistic circles, they do believe in the Torah and resurrection, are members of the local synagogues and communities, they do not terrorize their fellowmen in the land of the living, nor do they preach new creeds and entice people to idol-worship. It would be tempting, if space would permit such an attempt, to depict here the social and religious conditions lurking in the background of this Baraita. Such a picture would offer a dreary narrative of conditions prevailing in the first century of the Current Era. In this chapter, however, I limit my subject to the Jewish transgressors. In the first half of the third century, at least in Babylon, the meaning of this term פושעי ישראל בגופן and פושעי אומות העולם בגופן was not understood by the students of the Baraita, and they frankly asked for the meaning of these two terms. Rab interprets the first by referring to a man (lit. קרקפתא a skull, head of a man) who does not put on phylacteries, and the latter by referring to a gentile, who lives in sin (i.e. an immoral life; עבירה, κατ' έξοχην is immorality). Though the leader of the school of Sura rightly estimates the importance of the law and observance of Tefillin, it is surprising that he would find no fault with the transgressor but the transgression of this one law. The author of the Seder Olam rabba could not have agreed with Rab's opinion, when he defined the term פושעי ישראל; for he interpreted the same, as we identified them, with people, who transgress the Mizwot, or, according to a Geniza fragment, who transgress Torah and Mizwot.8 This source judges the trans 1 Seder '01am r. ch. 3, cf. ed. A. Marx, p. 9.</page><page sequence="4">226 A. MARMORSTEIN [4] gressors more strictly than Rab. The version of Seder Olam rabba differs from the Tosefta in other respects as well. The heretics of the alternative group include besides the Minim, Epicureans, and those who deny resurrection, the following new sets: apostates (משומדים), blasphemers, Boethoseans, those who despise the festivals, and who say that the Torah is not revealed from heaven. The latter can be classified with those who deny the Torah in the Baraita. There remain merely the informers unaccounted. Yet, some manuscripts of the Seder Olam have the 9.מסורות On the other hand, the Tosefta has Meshummadim, who are missing in the Baraita.10 Anyhow, all texts agree that the פושעי ישראל have to be distinguished from the others. Yet, even they are here temporarily subjected to the pains of Gehenna. R. Simon ben Lakish solemnly repudiated this teaching. Surely, he could not have done so without some cogent reasons, and for some weighty consideration. Was he the only one, who in his independence of judgment stood aloof from his contemporaries? He is not the only one who judged so leniently, and showed signs of otherwise unusual tolerance. R. Simon the pious (חסידא), who most probably lived in the age of R. Simon ben Lakish, said: Every fast day service, which is not attended by the פושעי ישראל is not a proper fast day.11 Homiletically one can put into this sentence different ingenious meanings,12 historically it must be taken at its face value. The "transgressors" have to join, or to be admitted to, the services held on public fast days. There, again, they are considered as belonging to the community in spite of their faults and blunders. Who and what are they? One of their dogmas was that the Prophets and Hagiographa were not parts of the Torah, and they did not believe in them." 9 Ibid., p. 9, MSS. O and C. 10 Ed.

They keep the law of circumcision, but they walk according to the statutes of the Gentiles.14 This speaks for assimilation. Another indication of their indifference is in the next passage. There were פושעים in Israel, who got hold of Egyptian patrons, acquired fame, wealth and honor, and consequently did not care to leave Egypt with their brethren.15 Thirdly, a complaint is made that these people discourage or weaken Israel in perform ance of the Mizwot.16 Finally, they laugh and mock at the Messiah, who spends his time in prison.17 Occasionally, it is reported that they deny the existence of God.18 It is, however, doubtful, whether such statements can be taken literally, and if so, whether the report is not exaggerated, or biased. This doubt arises partly out of the attitude taken by men of the type of R. Simon ben Lakish, and R. Simon, the Pious, as shown earlier, and partly by other reports in favour of these transgressors. An anonymous preacher expounded Ps. 31.24 and saw in the "faithful, whom God preserves" our Posh'e Israel, who forcefully utter their Amen, in fact they say: "Blessed be He who revives the dead."19 Their chief doctrine was, therefore, belief in the resurrection, a belief which must have been exceed ingly pleasing to the ears and minds of the Rabbis. They further firmly believed and eagerly expected the redemption of Israel, and set great hopes on the rebuilding of Jerusalem. They repeated the Eighteen Benedictions, but whether they understood the same things, the same ways and modes of salvation, and New Jerusalem or not, we will leave in abeyance for the present.

MARMORSTEIN [6] matter of fact, it is recorded that they repaired morning and evening to the Synagogue.20 It is seriously discussed and contem plated, whether sacrifices can be accepted from them, and the decision is in the affirmative.21 Asked as to the attitude one should take, or manifest toward Jews, the 22,פושע ישראל who was interrogated by Nekyomanteia23 together with Titus and Balaam, the representatives of Rome and Gnosticism, when questioned as to who is honored in heaven and whether he should become a Jew, answered: Seek their good, and avoid their evil, for he who touches them is as if he had sinned against God.23a This friendly spirit to Jews and Judaism is most remarkable. To sum up, we see that there were friendly and unfriendly views taken of these transgressors; they had manifested virtues and yet had shown peculiarities, which alienated the Rabbis from them; they surely did not give up their intimacy with the. Synagogue, yet they loosened the tie of unity which held Jews together all over the world and through the ages. We find here in the third century a peculiar sect of Jews, who retain some laudable characteristics of Jewish religion and life, and yet, with one foot stand outside the camp. II This material, on which our knowledge of the Posh'e Israel rests, was collected by the present writer more than 20 years ago.24 1 suggested then that •they represent Jews by origin and customs, who believed in Jesus. Since then I have searched in Jewish and Christian sources, and examined my thesis anew. I have found that the key for the understanding of these problems must be sought in external sources.

I studied first the Clementine Homilies and Recognitions which revealed to me the Posh'e Israel in their true character. Apart from the fact that the romance in which the Clementine writings are dressed is the mutual property of Judaism and Christianity25 they possess many Jewish elements, and betray Jewish influence and Jewish workmanship. Jews and Judaism, Jewish lore and rite, Jewish thought and life, are the beginning and the end of the Clementines. There is something strange in the fact that these literary documents prefer the name "Hebrew",26 whilst Rabbinic sources throughout favour the term "Israel" and only occasionally the name "Jehudi" is used, mostly in Aramaic fragments or when Gentiles are speaking of Jews. Mosaism and Christianity are identical, Moses and Jesus are the only true prophets. There is no suggestion of the abrogation of the law, as taught by Barnabas or Paul. One of the greatest New Testa ment and Patristic scholars of Germany, Prof. Carl Schmidt, says in his recent work on the Clementines:27 "In der gesamten kirchlichen Literatur werden wir vergebens nach derartigen Gedanken iiber die Gleichwertigkeit des mosaischen Glaubens und des Christentums suchen." These Jewish-Christians cele brate Passover on the fourteenth of Nisan in the same manner as the Jews. They are strict in their Sabbath observance and most particular about the laws of ritual impurity. They adhere to the decree of the Apostles as to the dietary laws and perform the rite of circumcision. There are plenty of proofs for these assertions. The Jewish Christians gather in Jerusalem on the Jewish Pesach. Jerusalem *s Cf. the relations of the two stories in my article referred to above, note 23. 36 Cf.

Quid est ergo, quod nullum Judaeorum in ilia die cogit genesis aut iter agere aut aedificare aut vendere obliquid aut emere.29 The Ps. Clementines lay much stress on a propria quaedam nostrae religionis observantia, quae non tarn imponitur hominibus, quam proprie ab unoquoque deum colenti causae puritatis expetitur.30 They observed puritas, first of all according to the law of Leviticus (re menstruatae mulieri misceatur), secondly, etiam corpus aqua diluere, and thirdly the observantia castimoniae. They lived and thought as Jews, and were attacked by their fellow-Christians as Jews, and by Jews as apostates. Hence their ambiguous position! Ill The Syriac Didascalia preserved a number of the most hostile attacks of the "Catholic Church" against Jews who believed in Christ but could not sever their Jewish connections. The Didas calia appeals to Jewish-Christians not to be guided by the Jewish calendar and celebrate the Passover on the fourteenth of Nisan.31 They should not imitate the ways of the Jews as far as the observance of the Sabbath goes.32 The writer dishes up old33 objections against the Sabbath: Why did the saints of old not observe the Sabbath? Why does God Himself not keep Sabbath? He is mightily upset and grieved that men and women in certain cases perform their ritual bath34 or that Jewesses keep away from places of worship during the seven days of the menses.35 The latter custom prevailed among Jews for many centuries and is still observed in many countries by non-Jews as well.36 28 Cf.

The latter urge the Jews to give up their Jewish practices, e.g. ritual bathing and dietary law, to which they still cling," for only the Decalogue is binding, the rest of the Torah was given as a temporary law, as a punishment for the making of the golden calf, and was abolished with the advent of the true Prophet. The whole law is the Repetition of the Law, the curse of the Deuteronomy. This is one of the Didascalia's pet ideas. The term Repetition of the Law was not known to the Clementine writers, yet they must have stood in close relationship with similar ideas. They speak of the true prophet, i.e., Jesus. All the other prophets are not true at all. Consequently all Prophets and Hagiographa are rejected. Yet even parts of the Pentateuch, e.g. the sacrifices, are objected to. The whole institution of sacrifices is explained as a concession of Moses to his weak contemporaries, who built the golden calf, demonstrating that they were too much contami nated by Egyptian cults and examples, of which they could not rid themselves.38 A similar idea is represented in the Haggada by R. Levi39 who was somewhat younger than the assumed date of the Ps. Clementines' source. These points the Posh'e Israel shared with the Gentile-Christians. No wonder that even their zeal and loyalty to Jewish life and ritual were looked upon as half-hearted by the majority, and genuine or wholly worthy by only a few. The Didascalia was written with the specific purpose of 3ל Didasc. chap. 26. 38 Rec. 1.35ff. Meantime when Moses, the faithful and wise steward, perceived that the vice of sacrificing to idols had been deeply ingrained into the people from their association with the Egyptians, and that the root of the evil could not be extracted from them, he allowed them indeed to sacrifice, but permitted it to be done only to God, that by some such means he might cut off one half of the deeply ingrained evil, leaving the other half to be cor rected by another, and at a future time. 3י Lev. r. 22.5: משל לבן מלך שנס לבו עליו והיה למד לאכול בשר נבלות וטרפות אסר המלך זה יהיה תדיר על שולחני ומעצמו הוא נדור, כך לפי שהיו ישראל להוטים אחרי ע"ז במצרים והיו מביאים קרבניהם לשעירים וכו' .... יהיו מקריבין לפני בכל עת קרבנותיהן באוהל מועד ויהיו נפרשין מעיז והם ניצולים.

Owing to this tendency Jews and Judaism fare rather badly in that work. The author, whosoever he might have been, is in many instances indebted to Jewish, especially Rabbinic, teaching. Korah is depicted as loving preeminence, coveting the High-Priesthood, and criticizing Moses' heathen wife, i.e. the Aethiopian.40 Most probably the Didascalia is here indebted to some Gnostic critic, who took the part of Korah, and sided against Aaron.41 For the view that Manasseh's sins were forgiven, one can likewise find authority in the Haggadah of R. Judah ben liai of the second, or of R. Yolianan b. Nappaha in the third century.42 The admonition to Christians not to let their hair grow, but to cut it,43 has a striking parallel in a Baraita, which assumes that letting one's hair, or finger-nails grow, brings man into trouble, or leads to worry.44 Didascalia as well as some of the rabbis at some periods evince hostile sentiments towards the books of the heathen.45 There is no special purpose in pointing out some parallels in which Didascalia and the rabbis coincide in ethical and religious aspects, for they may have formed them independently, or these may go back to common experience or presumptions. Thus, when both teach to honour one's master as one honours God,46 that sin brings forth sin,47 that man should live in repentance, and live a clean life for he does not know his 40 Didasc. chap. 23; cf.

It is not impossible that the writer of the Didascalia was born a Jew, and as such indebted to the Rabbis in more than one instance. It would be futile to treat here at greater length the question of priority in spite of the many striking coincidences between the two groups,50 yet it is of some importance for the date of the Didascalia that the similarities can be traced back to Tannaitic material. This agreement is in small matters, in trifles and petty points; the greater is the gulf between them in vital matters, when the author of the Didascalia comes to grips with problems which do matter, with questions of life and death, of being or not being. The writer, who may or may not have sat at the feet of the masters of Usha or Sepphoris, Tiberias or Meron, finds cruel pleasure in teasing and taunting his poor fellow-congregants, that their brethren are a God-forsaken nation.51 He was not the first to spread this cruel doctrine, and not the last.

MARMORSTEIN [12] This taunt was born in the pagan mind at the sight of the numerous misfortunes and subjugations of the Jews, even before the final catastrophe in the year 70 C.E. How much more so after the destruction of the Temple and the devastation of the land. Cicero merely asserts that "while Jerusalem was flourish ing, while the Jews were in a peaceful state, still the religious ceremonies and observances were much at variance with the splendour of this Empire, the dignity of our name and the insti tutions of our ancestors. And they are the more odious to us now because that nation has shown by arms what its feelings were to our supremacy. How beloved of the immortal gods that nation was, is proved by the fact that it has been defeated, that its revenues have been farmed out, and that it is reduced to a state of subjection."53 Jews were consequently hated and forsaken by the gods. This impressed the victims very little and did not disturb them. Celsus54 turns against Jews and Christians proving that the God of both must be very weak in allowing the slaughter of the whole military youth of his people, the burning of his city. Further he says:55 "It is quite improbable that they are specially loved by God, or more beloved than others, or that special angels descended to them from Heaven, etc. For we saw with our own eyes which advantages, which preferences they and their country received!" Origen tells us56 that Celsus foretold the ruin of the Jews, which is going to take place in the near future. He speaks in the manner of a prophet in prophesying their fate; overlooking all the care, which God bestowed upon the Jews, and the revered laws and institutions, which he handed down to them; he fails to notice that through their defeat the wealth of the pagans is increased.

Joshua ben Hananja has a pentomimic dispute with an Epicurean as to Israel's being forsaken.59 Titus is credited with the saying that the God of the Jews has become old and weak, therefore he is unable to help them.60 The defeats in 70 C.E. and 135 C.E. surely appeared to the pagan mind as an eloquent and undeniable proof that the God of the Jews lost his strength, that he forsook his people, as expressed in the Dialogue of Tinaeus Rufus with R. Akiba.61 There must have been theologians, who taught that the withdrawal from Israel was merely a tempo rary one.62 Paul and Barnabas adopted and adapted this dogma. They based their arguments on passages in the prophets, which contain unfavourable or condemning words about Israel. Paul65 refers to Hosea 2.25, and Barnabas64 to the story of the golden calf in order to teach that Israel was supplanted by the new Israel, or was forsaken by God, and that Israel never entered the covenant with God. The consequences of these teachings we see before us in the Didascalia. Their influence was most strongly felt by the teachers of the third century. The Tannai tic Haggada could not ignore the taunt that Israel was forsaken,65 yet it was by no means so systematically and so often disputed as in the age of the Amoraim.66 Most of the great apologists for Judaism in the third century dwell on the doctrine of God's unchangeable love for Israel on one side, and strongly repudiate on the other side the idea of Israel being forsaken by God. While doing so, « Ibid., VIII, 39 and 69. 58 Cf. b. Yebamot 102b, Midr. Ps. 10, Midrash Haggadah Lev. 26.9, Bâcher, Ag. der Tannaiten I, 82, 6. Biichler, A.

Kahana78 are witnesses for the actuality and frequency of the Jewish defence against the charge of the Didascalia. Even more eloquent is the anonymous Haggada on this question. The scoffers tell me: מי שהגלה אתכם שוב אין משיב אתכם (He, who exiled you, will never bring you back, i.e., to Jerusa lem!).79 These people base their theory on the Scriptures, e.g. Lam. 4.16. In this connection a religious persecution is spoken of, forbidding circumcision, Sabbath and the reading of the law, probably earlier than the Justinian prohibitions.80 Israel was accompanied by God into exile.81 Job 39.27 is a reply to those who assert that the Temple will never be built again.82 A preacher ex pounded Ps. 3.3f. applying the verses to Israel. The nations of the world (i.e. רבים, the many) rejoiced when Israel made the golden calf, and spoke about them, saying : Hence there is no salvation and existence left for them!83 Here we meet in the Haggada, not for the first time as will be shown later on, the view that Israel lost its claim on God, and God gave Israel up on account of Israel's sin. In a homily on Ps. 4.3 God repeats the words of the nations of the world who say: God has left them, forgotten them, and He will never return unto them. This argument is not true. God has not forsaken and never will forsake Israel.84 The compiler of the Midrash on Exodus uses many older homilies and fragments of Midrashic works in which this problem was treated at greater length.

MARMORSTEIN [16] dwelt in Zion, God was among them. When they sinned they were cast out. Yet, when he sees that they persevere in the performance of the commandments, then God repents what he wrought against Zion, and pleads Zion's case and contemplates the return of the exiles.85 Secondly, when Israel was exiled from Jerusalem, and the enemies carried them away in chains, then the nations of the world said : God does not like this nation ! as it is said: Reprobate silver they shall call them (Jer. 6.30). Silver can be melted and used for making vessels, once or twice, or more times, but finally one breaks it and it becomes useless; similarly Israel was talked of as a fallen people which had no hope to rise any more,86 God having rejected them. When Jeremiah heard this, he said: "Lord of the world! hast Thou really rejected them?" (cf. Jer. 14.19, "Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? Hath thy soul loathed Zion? Why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us?"). It is to be compared to a man, who was in the habit of beating his wife. Her Shushbin said to her husband : "How long are you going on like that beating her? If you want to drive her away, beat her to death, if not, why do you beat her?" He says: "Even if the whole of my palace is to be destroyed, I will not divorce her!" Thus says Jeremiah: "If you intended to drive us away, beat us to death (Lam. 5.22), if not, why do you beat us without healing?" God replies: "Even if I destroy my whole world I will not drive Israel away" (cf. Jer. 31.36. "If heaven above can be measured, and the foundation of the earth searched out beneath, I will cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done"). God will never sever his connec tion with his people. The author of this homily must have faced missionaries in Galilee, who propagated the Gospel of Israel's rejection, and of the Jews being forsaken by God, as taught in the Didascalia. A third homilist preached on Ex. 25.1, and according to the way of preaching in his age, connected his text with Ps. 68.19. 8s Ex. r. 30.8: כך ישראל היו בציון והקב־ה שרוי ביניהן, וכיון שחטאו טרפה אף ה''א השליכה בניה עליו וכשהוא רואה לישראל שעושים מצותיו מתנחם על מה שעשה בציון ומבקש לה זכות וגו'. 86 Ex. r. 31.10: והיו או"ה אומרים אין הקב"ה חפץ באומה זו and כן ישראל, היו אומרים שאין להם תקומה שמאסן הקב'ה, cf. also Num. r. 16.23, Tanlj. B. IV, 71.</page><page sequence="17">[17] JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY 239 Accordingly the words "and they bring me an offering" has a bearing on the verse in Psalms: "Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive!" How did the preacher accom plish his task? "Thou hast ascended," that is Moses (cf. Ex. 19.3 and 20.21). "Thou hast led captivity captive"; a king is grieved when his armies are led away captive. Thou wilt say that the same is the case with God? The text continues: "Thou hast received." When a man sells some of his property, he is grieved. (Perhaps the same happened with God?) Therefore it says: "Gifts of men." God said to them: I consider it as if I had given it to you as a present. The rebellious also: God spake to Moses: What do those idolators say: "will I not return to them because they worshipped idols" (cf. Ex. 37.8, Deut. 9.12)? No, even if they were rebellious I do not forsake (leave) them, and I do dwell among them, as it is said: God dwells among the rebellious.87 Let us turn to another compilation of homilies on Canticles,88 in which the compiler of the Midrash collected many sermons on the same subject. To Cant. 8.14.89 On the day the Temple was destroyed my Beloved fled, and became like a hart. Just as a hart runs from one end of the world to the other and returns to its place, so Israel, even though they are scattered in the whole world, they will in future return, cf. Hos. 2.9. Further in a parable to Cant. 6.2, we read: Israel is like a matrona, who rebelled against the king, and was divorced, driven out of the king's palace. People called her the divorced queen. She said: It is true that the king drove me out of his palace. Yet he did not repay me my dowry, and his name is still on me, i.e., I bear his name.90 8י Ex. r. 33.2: ד*א ויקחו לי חרוטה הה'ד עלית למרום שבית שבי, כל עלוייך לא היה אלא מן המרום ופשה עלה אל אלהים ומשה נגש אל הערפל שבית שבי מלך ביו בשעה שהיילותיו נשבים הוא מיצר תאמר אף כאן כך תיל לקחת. ובשעה שאדם מוכר הוא מיצר [תאמר אף כאן כך] תיל מחנות באדם. אמר להם כך אני מעלה עליכם כאילו מתנה נתתיה לכס. אף סוררים אסר הקביה למשה מה עמים אומרים שאיני חמר עמהם על שעבדו עכו־ם שנא' סרו מהר, אפילו סוררים הן איני מניח אותם ועסהם אני דר שנא' אף סוררים וכו'.

MARMORSTEIN [18] In a third place a sermon of R. Jochanan'1 is concluded with Deut. 30.9 and 3, containing the promises of God to return the exiles to the Holy Land.92 Anti-Jewish polemics did not stop short at this claim. "God hates Israel!" is a saying attributed to the nations of the world by a teacher of the third century, R. Shemaya.93 They try to sow hatred between God and Israel by their decrees and persecu tions, by death and torture, yet they are unable to extinguish the mutual love between God and Israel.94 These accusations of Israel's degradation and humiliation correspond literally to the words of the Didascalia. The author of this document clearly voices the feelings and expresses the attitude of Gentile-Christi anity, with a double point, first of all against Jews, and secondly against Jewish-Christians, the פושעי ישראל. The latter have been, it is true, converted to the belief in Jesus. That is not enough. They are under the curse of the law, especially the Repetition of the law. Why is Israel forsaken? Hated? Rejected? On account of the law. Paul and Barnabas could not find words strong enough to condemn the law. The law was given as a sign and as punishment for Israel's golden calf. The Didascalia follows the teaching of these religious leaders most faithfully. Did their teaching find adherents in the Jewish communities of Galilee, or was their preaching restricted to the churches? Surely, this latter was not the case, if our impression gained by the numerous homilies on this subject conveyed through the Haggadic litera ture is right. IV In the sermons, anonymous and otherwise, cited in the previous chapter, we could not avoid the feeling that the rejection of Israel was due to the sin of the golden calf.95 This view of the 1י Cf.

They are concerned with Moses' action in breaking the tablets, whether he did so at the command of God, or by his own will.97 There are some, none too numerous sayings on this subject by Tannaim, which in style and tone differ greatly from those of the Amoraic period. Some of the former may be cited here. R. Akiba, who defended Moses for breaking the tablets,98 seems to have pleaded also for Israel. He agrees with the School of R. Yannai, who ascribed the sin to the well-being of Israel; the abundance of gold and silver was the cause of the making of the golden calf.99 R. Yose, the Galilean, remarks: Come and see how weighty the force of sin is. Before Israel committed that sin (i.e. the golden calf) there were neither people with issues, nor leprous among them, but after wards there were.100 In the days of the teacher of these sages, of R. Eliezer b. Hyrkanos, a wise woman asked a question about the three different punishments meted out to the worshippers of the golden calf, but there is in it no trace of the dogma taught by the Church Fathers.101 Turning to the teachers of the post-Bar Kokba period one 54 Cf. esp. Tertullian, adv. Judaeos, ch. 1, cf. Justin, Dial. ch. 21, 22 and 27, Harnack, Dogmengeschichte I, 3, 579, Diestel, Geschichte des A.T. in der christl.christl. Kirche, Jena 1896, 55. Die Hauptstrafe fur diesen Abfall seien die Ceremonialgesetze. "" Cf. Abot R. Nathan ch. 2. R. Jose the Galilean, R. Judah ben Batyra, R. Eleazar ben Azarja, R. Akiba and R. Meir endeavour to explain Moses' extraordinary deed in breaking the two tablets. It is a veritable apology for Moses, but the burden of the accusation against Israel, as taught by the Church from the middle of the second century and onwards, is not yet discernible. 58 Cf. previous note: לא שבר משה את הלוחות אלא שנאסר לו פפי הגבורה שני ואתפוש •בשני הלחות בטה אדם תופס במה שיכול " Cf. b.

Yoma 66b, Gaster, Exempla No. 27, p. 20.</page><page sequence="20">242 A. MARMORSTEIN [20] notices the same attitude towards this problem. R. Meir, who defended Moses in his action,102 has a word also for Israel. They sinned whilst they were in a state of drunkenness.103 This lame apology was rightly refuted by R. Judah b. liai. Finally, R. Simon ben Yohai confirms our observation distinguishing between the Tannai tic and Amoraic treatment of this problem. He, on the lines of R. Yose ha Gelili,104 draws a psychological difference between Israel before the sin and after. Before they were fearless, afterwards they were frightened of Moses.105 In the time of the Mishna this agitation against Israel on account of the golden calf was still so mild and insignificant that no objection was raised to the reading and Targum of Ex. 32.If. Ex. 32.2If. was read, but not translated.106 How different is the outlook and the situation in the Amoraic Haggada! Here we again come across the same names, whose bearers lodged a lively protest against the saying : God has forsaken, or rejected Israel.JWe meet R. Hoshaya,107 R. Joshua ben Levi,108 102 Cf. above note 97. 10נ Cant. r. 2.13: אמרה כנסת ישראל הושלט כי יצר הרע ביין ואסרתי לעגל אלה אלהיך ישראל. 104 Cf. note 100. 1"s Sifre Num. 1, p. lb: בוא וראה מה כח עבירה קשה שעד שלא פשטו יריהם בעבירה מה נאמר בהם ומראה כבוד ה' כאש אוכלת לא יריאים ולא מזדעזעים משפשטו ידיהם בעבירה מה נאמר בהם וירא אהרן וכל בני ישראל והנה קרן עור פניו ויראו מנשת אליו; cf. Num. r. 106 M. Meg. Ill, b. Meg. 25b, pal. Meg. IV, 11, where in the Talmud different portions are assigned to the second מעשה עגל. B. Ber. 32a: משל לאדם שהיתה לו פרה כחושה ובעלת אברים האכילה כרשינין והיחה מבעטת בו איל מי גרס ליך שתהא מבעטת בי אלא כרשינין שהאכלתיך. The defence is on the same lines as that of R. Aljdba and the School of R. Jannai, cf. above note 99. 108 Eccl. r. 4.5, in Ex. r. 41.12. Midr. Eccl. z. p. 100, the passage is quoted in the name of R. Simon ben Yohai. Yet it is more probable that R. Joshua ben Levi is its author. Moses did not move from his place until he was granted forgiveness for Israel. A similar defence is put up by R. Abbahu, b. Ber. 32a: אלמלא מקרא כתוב אי אפשר לאומרו מלמד שתפסו משה להקב'ה כאדם שהוא תופס את תבירו בבגדו ואמר לפניו רבש'ע אין אני מניחך עד שתמחול ותסלח להם. In another saying R. Joshua ben Levi pleads: לא עשו ישראל את הענל אלא ליתן פתחון פה לבעלי תשובה. The story of the golden calf was not the source of a curse, i.e. the law, but an immense bliss, to teach the sinner repentance. I wonder who is more human, more enlightened, Paul, Barnabas, the Church Fathers on one side, or R. Joshua ben Levi, who may have followed an older saying of R. Simon ben YoJjai? Cf. b. A.

This apology tallies with the view cited above from the Ps. Clementines, note 38, and that of R. Levi, cf. note 39, cf. also Ex. r. 43.8, where the same idea is expressed by R. Hona, in the name of R. Yohanan in a somewhat fuller and clearer manner: ,משל לחכם שפתח לבנו חנות של בשמים בשוק של זונות, המבוי עשה שלו והאומנות עשתה שלה, והנער כבחור עשה שלו, יצא לתרבות רעה, בא אביו ותפסו עם הזונה התחיל האב צועק ואומר הורגך אני, היה שם אוהבו איל אתה איבדת את הנער ואת צועק כנגדו, הנחת כל האומניות ולא למדחו אלא בשם והנחת כל המבואות ולא פתחת לו חנות אלא בשוק של זונות, כך אמר משה רבון העולם הנחת כל העולם ולא שעבדת בניך אלא במצרים שהיו עובדים טלאים ולמדו מהם בניך ואף הם עשו העגל. A similar apology is taught by R. Abin in the name of R. Simon ben Yehozadak, Ex. r. 43.10, the application of which reads: כך כשעשו ישראל אותו מעשה בקש הקב"ה לכלוחס אפר משה רבון העולם לא ממצרים הוצאתם ממקום עיז ועכשיו נערים הם הפתן מעט להם ולך עמהם ועושין לפניך מע'ט הוי אשר הוצאת. R. Yohanan further asserts that God's vow was dissolved by Moses, as a scholar annuls vows of people. Hence R. Simon ben Lakish explains the fact that Moses was called איש האלהים, the man who annulled God's vow, Ex. r. 43.5. 110 Cant. r. 2.3 defends the worship of the calf by assuming that Israel was not liable for punishment until the Law was expounded to them in the Tent of Appointment: כך אע'פ שהתורה נחנה בהר סיני לא נענשו עליה עד שנתפרש להם באוהל מועד. Cf. Lev. r. 1.10: אע'פ שנתנה תורה ס'ינ לישראל מסיני לא נענשו עליה עד שנישנית באוהל מועד—כך אע־פ שנתנה תורה לישראל לא נענשו עליה עד שנישנית להם באוהל מועד; cf. also Cant. r. 3.4: שמשם נתח"בו ישראל (anonymously), further Cant. r. 8.2, where R. Berakya says: זה סיני איר ברכיה למה קודאין לסיני בית שמשם נעשו ישראל כתינוק בן יומו? The idea is that the erection of the Tabernacle wiped off the sin of the golden calf. Thus R. Berakya goes a step further in the defence of the .מעשה עגל 111 R. Levi defends the deed of Israel in different ways: God forgave Israel and has not rejected his people, Lev. r. 1.3: בן אביתר שויתר הקב'ה על ידיו מעשה העגל. Of a similar type is his saying in Lev. r. 27.7, כל פעולות טובות ונחמות שהקב'ה עתיד לעשות עם ישראל אינ!ם אלא בשביל פועה שפעיתם לפני בסיני ואמרתם כל אשר דבר ה' נעשה ונשמע וכוי תועבה יבחר בכם אותה תועבה שכתוב עשו להם עגל מסכה מאותו התועבה הביאו לפני קרבן. The very sacrifice shall remove the sin of the calf. Ibid.,Ibid., 27.8, after a parable of a suspected matrona, R. Levi quotes the saying of the nations of the world: כך אומות העולם מונין להם לישראל ואומרים להם עשיתם אח העגל' ובדק הקביה בדברים ולא מצא בהם ממש. Here R. Levi in his apologetic zeal is inclined to treat the whole crime as a meaningless suspicion. This is surely exaggerated; cf. however, Ex. r. 49.2, שחורה אני בשור שני וימירו את כבודם בתבנית שור ונאוה אני בשור, שור או כבש או עז and Cant. r. 1.5. In a third homily R. Levi preaches that God foresaw at the revelation at Sinai that Israel was going to commit that crime of idolatry, Cant. r. 1.2: ר' פנחס בשם ר' לוי גלוי היה לפני הקב'ה שעתידים ישראל להמיר כבודו באחר שני וימירו כבודם שלא יהא אומרים אלו הראנו את</page><page sequence="22">244 A.

Ex. r. 41.3. R. Pineas b. Hama, cf. in the name of R. Levi: 'אלא שהיה צפוי וגלוי לפני הקב'ה שעתידין ישראל אחר מ' יום לעשות העגל וכו. Since no apology is attached to this sermon, which is somewhat surprising, most probably R. Levi elaborated an older saying. The term מקום for God corroborates such a suggestion. There is a long sermon in which the two ideas of Israel's rejection and the sin of Israel are defended, written either by R. Levi or by R. Simon b. Lakish, cf. b. Ber. 32b, cf. however Yalljut Makiri Isaiah p. 179. There Israel says before God: Lord of the Universe! A man marries a second wife and remembers the first one. Thou, however, hast forgotten and forsaken me! God assures Israel that the whole universe was created for Israel's sake, how can He forget all the sacrifices of Israel in the wilderness? Since there is no forgetfulness before God perhaps he still remembers the deed of the calf. No, this is forgotten. Since there is forgetfulness before God He might have forgotten the Deed of Sinai? No, this I will not forget. The latter doctrine is ascribed to R. Hoshaya (cf. note 67) taught by R. Eleazar (cf. note 110). Finally in a homily of R. Levi we read: יסכר פיהם של אויה שהיו אומרים לישראל שאין השכינה חוזרת אלינו לעולם שני רבים אוסרים לנפשי ונו' אלו עד שלא עשו את הענל בא הקב'ה ושרה אצלם משכעס עליהם אינו חוזר עליהם. Tanh. f. 134a. The reply is again that the building of the Temple is an eloquent proof that God has forgiven Israel. Here, again, the rejection of Israel and the deed of the calf are closely connected, as in the Didascalia. 112 Deut. r. 1.2: בשעה שעשו ישראל אח הענל ביקש הקב'ה לכלות שונאיהן של ישראל, איל משה רבש'ע העגל הזה טוב הוא לסייע לך. איל הקב'ה מה מסייע לי? איל אס אתה מוריד גשמים הוא מפריח טללים אתה מוציא את הרוחות והוא מוציא את הברקים. איל הקב'ה אף אתה תועה כענל? איל רבש'ע למה יחרה אפך בעטך, ולישראל אמר אתם חטאתם חטאה נדולה. The sin, alleged by the nations of the world to have broken God's covenant with Israel, is not so weighty as assumed. A similar homily is given in Exod. r. 43.6 from a source, which bears all the characteristic features of the Yelamdenu, scil. אלהים as the name of God, in the name of R. Nefiemya, reading: בשעה שעשו ישראל אותו מעשה עמד לו משה מפייס את האלהיס אמר רבו! העולם עשו לך סיוע ואתה כועס עליהם, הענל הזה יהיה מסייעך אתה טזדיח את החמה והוא הלבנה, אתה הכוכבים והוא המזלות, אתה מוריד את הטל והוא משיב רוחות, אתה מוריד נשמים והוא מנדל צמחים, אמר הקב'ה משה אף אתה טעית כסותם והלא אין בו ממש איל אם כן למה אתה כועס על בניך הוי ה' למה יחרה אפך. Num. r. 2.15 copies merely a part of the homily, without mentioning either the name of R. Isaac, or that of R. Nehemya: אמר לו משה זה הענל שעשו ישראל עכשיו הוא מסייעך הוא מוריד נשמים ואתה מפריח טללים איל הקב"ה וכי יש בו תוחלת? איל משה ואם אין בו ממש למה ה' יחרה אפך בעמך וכו' מה כתוב אחריו וינחם. Cf. also Pes. rabbati 46a, Cant. r. on 1.6. R. Isaac relates the following story: מעשה בקרתנית אחת שהיה לה שפחה כושית שירדה למלאת סן העין היא וחברתה אסרה לחברתה: חברתי למחר אדני מנרש את אשתו ונוטלני לאשה! אמרה לה: למה? בשביל שראה ידיה מפוחמות, אמרה לה: אי שוטה שבעולם 'שממו אזניך מה שפיך מדברת ומה אם אשתו שהיא חביבה עליו ביותר את אומרת מפני שראה ידיה מפוחמות</page><page sequence="23">[23] JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY 245 b.

Gentile-Christianity cannot reproach Israel for "once" making an idol, since it is steeped in idolatry, cf. also a fragment of a Midrash in Jellinek's Bet ha-Midrash, V, 160f. נ" R. Samuel ben Nabmani often recurs to this subject. He defends Israel either in the name of his teacher, or in his own name. In the name of R. Jonathan b. Eleazar he teaches, Ex. r. 43.1: כך בשעה.שעשו ישראל את העגל היה השטן עומד ומקטרג בפנים ומשה עומד מבחוץ. מה עשה משה, עמד ודחף את השטן והוציאו לחוץ ועמד במקומו. R. Samuel b. Nabmani expounds and develops this theory even further by increasing and exaggerating the anthropomorphic tendency of the Haggadah by saying: כך בשעה שעשו ישראל אותו מעשה ישב הקב"ה עליהם בדין לחייבם, ולא עשה אלא בא לחתום נזר דינן, מה עשה משה? נטל את הלוחות מתוך ידו של הקכ'ה כדי להשיב חמתו, כך עשה משה ביון שעשו ישראל אותו מעשה נטל את הלוחות ושברן וכל. It is obvious that R. Samuel b. Nabmani availed himself of R. Jose the Galilean's defence of Moses. Cf. note 93. Yet, there the defence of Moses' deed, of his breaking the tablets, is the chief aim, here the defence of Israel against the nations' verdict. This appears to me a most remarkable contrast between the aims of the teachers who preached in the first decades of the 2nd century C.E. and the tendency manifested by those of the 3rd cent. C.E. There is a full century between them, in which Christianity made full headway in its opposition to Judaism. The second apology of this teacher is also most remarkable in its tendency as well as in expression. It is a flat denial of Israel's guilt. Israel did not at all commit that terrible crime for which the nations of the world, Apostolic and Church Fathers, condemned their contemporaries for alleged crimes of their ancestors. The latter are not responsible for the calf, but the proselytes and strangers within their midst. R. IJuna and R. Idi say in the name of R. Samuel b. Nahmani: מוצלים היו ישראל מאותו מעשה, שאילו עשו את הענל היה להם לומר אלה אלהינו ישראל, אלא הגרים שעלו עמהם עשאוהו ואפרו לישראל אלה אלהיך ישראל, Tanh. Lev. B. 94. Cf. also Lev. r. 27.7, Pesikta. In a third homily, God's forgiveness is emphasized, contrasting God's charac ter with that of a human being, Tanb- Frkft. 27a: וכן אתה מוצא אחר שעשו ישראל את הענל ובקש עליהם משה רחמים מה הקב'ה איל וידבר די אל משה לך עלה מזה וכוי, איל הק' משה איני כביו שאומר ליתן מתנה וחוזר בו הוי לא איש אל ויכזב. מהו אופר ולא יעשה אם אמר בשעת כעסו להביא רעה שבן חוזר שכן אפר למשה הרף סמני וגו', ולא עשה אלא וינחם על הרעה וכן ועתה הניחה לי ויחר אפי בהם ולא עשה אלא ויאמר ד' סלחתי כדבריך איל הקב'ה איני כבשר ודם שאוסר לעשות רעה ומתגאה לעשותה. I wonder whether R. Samuel b. Nabmani ever read the Epistle of Paul to the Galatians 3.15fL: "Brethren, I speak after the manner of men : Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto, etc." R. Samuel b. Nabmani's words might have been directed against Paul. In a fourth homily again the building of the Tabernacle is adduced to disprove that God has npt forgiven Israel for the deed of the calf: קרות היא לבאי העולם Tanfy,</page><page sequence="24">246 A. MARMORSTEIN [24] b. Simon,116 R. Abba b. Kahana,"7 R. Ari,118 and R. Judah bar Shalom,11' most of them familiar to the readers of these pages.120 Reviewing the teachings of these teachers, given fully in the footnotes, one is surprised by many quaint and unusual features. These teachers of the third century seem compelled to wipe off from Israel's history the sin of the golden calf. This whitewashing sounds strange, remembering the narrative of the Bible. The attempt to throw off all responsibility for that not too glorious deed and to lay the burden on the strangers who joined the camp of Israel sounds more like the fancy of a learned antiquarian and an eloquent preacher than true history. Even those Hagga dists who do not shut their eyes to the truth are inclined to invent legends and situations proving the pardon granted by God to Israel. It cannot be denied that Christian fanatic polemics Frkft. 136b. The term באי העולם is here intentionally used, to indicate the objections of the nations of the world; similarly in the application of the parable, where one reads: אמרוהנוים (אויה) שוב אינו חוזר אליהם. Finally there is a fifth homily of R. Samuel b. Nahmani, which cannot be understood without bearing in mind the anti-Jewish attacks on the part of the hostile Church. He says: !בו ביום שעשו ישראל את הענל בו ביום ירד להן הטן ולא עוד אלא שנטלו ממנו והקריבו לעי שנא' ולחמי אשר נתתי לך סלח ובו', Tanlj. Frkft. 264b. Although Israel used the manna for idolatry, nevertheless God's gifts never ceased; so his covenant was not annulled, cf. also Tanlj. Frkft. 123a f., where the homily is fuller than here, and Ex. r. 44.2 and 7. R. Simlai sees in Isa. 53.12 a characteristic of Moses: והוא חטא רבים נשא שכיפר על מעשה העגל, b. Sotah 14a; consequently Moses achieved Israel's atonement for the deed of the calf. "s Cf. above, note 108. 116 Tanh. Frkft. 122a. The payment of the Shekel atoned for the sin of the calf. Num. r. 7.4 they were punished with leprosy for the deed of the calf. Cf. above note 100. M. Deut. Zutta, ed.

The dark clouds of misrepresentations, the gloomy spirit of fanaticism in the new sect or sects used the Bible for a cruel game of humiliation and subjugation, which poisoned and embittered the relationship between Judaism and Christianity. It is, naturally, impossible for a Christian to be quite impartial in judging that colossal fight between two religions, which are so near to, and yet so far from, one another. Yet, any impartial reader of the Bible will, nowadays, smile at the attack of the Church more than at the defence of the Hagga dists. The latter, however unsatisfactory their views might appear from the historian's point of view, are nearer to the modern approach to the Holy Scriptures. This defence was the more vital among the Galilean Jews of the third century, since, with the acceptance of the theory that Israel was forsaken as a consequence of the golden calf, che doctrine of the abrogation of the Law penetrated into the hearts of Jewish-Christians and Jews. The traces of this struggle for the law will be the subject of the next chapter. V However humiliating the thought that God had forsaken Israel, the Shekinah being far removed from the community of the Jews, however teasing and annoying the impossible argument that Israel's covenant with God had been broken, or that it: had never been effective, the calumny, and no milder word can be found for it, that the Law is a curse, the Law a cruel punishment, passes our comprehension. Could an impartial mind, one not blinded by hatred, a religious leader or teacher not perverted by selfish motives, really preach that the Law was closing the door to seekers after God? The author of the Book of Jubilees must have had in mind some such opposition to the Law even before Jesus and Paul arose, when he said that Israel's precepts and ordinances, moral and ritual alike, are not the ephemeral expres sion of the moral consciousness of a particular age, but are valid for all eternity (2.18, 15.27). The eternity of the Law is taught also by other writers of Pseudepigraphical literature.121 That these »' Cf. I Baruch 59.2.</page><page sequence="26">248 A. MARMORSTEIN [26] writers were confronted by antinomistic tendencies can be shown not by one but by many passages in their works.1" It was left to the writer of the Epistle to the Galatians to invent the theory that the Law is of divine origin but was given as a punishment to the Jewish people for their wickedness and sins.123 Since Justin Martyr"4 there is a tendency in favor of collecting Biblical passages which show that God needs nothing, whence the proof is deduced that all, or some at least, of the institutions of the Jews cannot represent God's will. Here Justin coincides with the old Jewish polemics against the gods and their needs on one side, which have a close parallel with Epicurean thought, and with Marcionite polemics against the Bible on the other side. Some writers of Early Christianity point out the Sabbath, circum cision and dietary laws as ridiculous and laughable."5 Tertullian does not treat these matters in the frivolous manner of the Alexandrian and Roman Antisemitic literature, but raises the often trumpetted cry, how is it that people, who did not [keep Sabbath, or practice circumcision, were called friends of God?"6 Clemens of Alexandria takes an exceptional stand in acknowl edging the educational value of the Law,"' which is, naturally, not entirely denied by writers like Tertullian"8 and some others, who became conscious that the earlier radical view of the abroga tion of the Law was detrimental and contradictory to the teaching of the Church about the divinity of the Holy Bible. Only later, when the Gnostic flood abated, did the preachers and teachers of the Church revert to their antinomistic attitude."» So much so that after the consolidation of Christianity, Jewish ceremonies and observances became a laughing stock on the part of clergy "2 Enoch 94.3, Jub. 1.9, 1.20, 6.37, Baruch 41.3, IV Ezra 7.21-25; cf. also Mark 13.31, Matt. 5.18. 123 Gal. 3.19f.

The Church vied with the ancient satirists and come dians of Rome to satisfy the bias and keep alive the ancestral hatred of the new converts. I cannot believe that there are many bishops or professors of theology in Western Europe, who believe today that Moses spoke in spirit, namely, in a spiritual sense, but suggest that the Jews, as the writer of the Barnabas letter asserts, were led into error by a bad angel and adopted the carnal and literal meaning of the Mosaic laws and injunctions which concealed the spiritual truths, and that thus the entire ceremonial system was a result of a deplorable misconception."י» Yet, nevertheless, I can point out some misconceptions of Christian theologians about the Jewish attitude to the laws of Moses, especially when Schurer teaches in his history:130 "wie die Motive im wesentlichen doch âusserlicher Art sind, so ist auch das Résultat eine unglaubliche Verâusserlichung des religiôsen und sittlichen Lebens." On a similar misunderstanding is based the opinion of Keim:13' "Es wiederholte die jiid. Gesetzgebung, aber je ernstlicher es ihren sittlichen Inhalt herauskehrte und die geforderte Heiligung des aiisserern und noch vielmehr des innern Lebens schârfte, um so mehr uberschritt es die notdurftigen Buchstaben des Gesetzes, um so mehr ignorierte es jede rituelle und ceremonielle Aeusserlichkeit." Here breathes Pauline spirit and Marcionite bias against the law. Jewish-Christians, however, taught differently and thought otherwise. The Epistle of James132 admonished Jewish-Christians in a spirit quite in agreement with Rabbinic lore: "Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of transgressing all." Jewish teaching and Rabbinic thoughts are repeated by the writer of the Clementine homiles'33 when he says : "For he is a worshipper of God, of whom I speak, who is truly pious, not one who is such only in name, but who really performs the deeds of the law that has been given him." "If he, who is of another tribe, keeps the law, he is a Jew; but he who does not keep it is a Greek. For the Jew believes in God and keeps the law." "But he who keeps "*&gt; Barnabas Letter ch.

MARMORSTEIN [28] not the law is manifestly a deserter through not believing God ; and thus is no Jew, but a sinner." They are the Posh'e Israel of R. Simon b. Lakish.134 and of Simon the Pious.135 The authorities of the Church had a difficult task to entice Jews and Gentiles alike from the Law. Synods and pulpits encouraged all their incumbents and representatives to threaten and condemn with hell fire above and disabilities of the Church below on earth all those who adhered to the law of Moses and his successors. How were these calumnies received by the Jews? And how were they refuted by the teachers of the Synagogue? Apart from the group, by no means small, of Posh'e Israel, who must have been mightily disturbed by this fight against the Law which was still sacred and dear to them, the community of real Jews deeply felt this onslaught on the most vital fortress of their very existence. Teachers of the second century raised their voices against the doctrine that the Law was given to Israel as a punishment and chastisement. No! the law was the most eloquent sign of God's love for his people, Israel. The Tannaitic Haggada preserves a number of sayings intended to bring home this truth.136 The Mizwot have no other function to man from God, than to increase man's holiness. This was emphasized137 by a teacher of the second century, Issi ben Judah, who heard, or read that some people taught abominable ideas about the law. R. Hananya '3« Cf. above note 2. '35'35 Cf. above note 11. '3' Sifre Deut. § 36, 75b: חביבין ישראל שסונכן הקכ־וז במצות תפילין בראש ותפילין כזרוע מזוזה בפתחיהם וציצית על ד' כנפות כסותך. Cf. b. Menahot 43b, Tos. Berakot ch. 1, b. Sabb. 130a, M. Ps. 6.1, Tanb- B. 111,110 and IV,73. The latter sources speak eloquently for the apologetic tendency underlying them. M. Ps. concludes with a peroration against the Minim and Posh'e Israel, who deny the existence of God; their share will be the fire of Hell. It is doubtful whether פושעי ישראל is correct, perhaps it refers to apostates of a later period? Tanh. Ill has: אם תקיימו מצוחי מניח אני את העליונים וארד לשכון ביניכם. The law could not be so bad, if God makes it a condition of His dwelling in Israel's midst. Tanh. IV has the teaching that Torah and Mizwot assure Israel's share in the world to come, זרע הקכ'ה לישראל את התורה ואת המצות לישראל והנחילם חיי העולם הבא. God did not leave a single thing without Mizwot. Surely not for punishment, or to deprive them of future bliss, salvation, or nearness of the Shekina. Just the reverse, in order to draw them near to the divine presence, w Mekilta 98a.</page><page sequence="29">[29] JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY 251 b. Akasya, another sage of this time, said that the law was given in order to enable Israel to acquire merit.138 The Babylonian Rab surely was moved by some special motive in teaching that God commanded the law in order to cleanse mankind.139 It is remark able that Rab considers the Mizwot binding and effective in the case of all creatures, without distinctions of race and creed, nationality and religion. Some copyists or editors of the Mid rashim, e.g. that of Midrash Psalms,140 Leviticus rabba,141 Midrash Samuel,142 read "Israel," yet in the Tanchuma the reading "creatures" coincides with that of Gen. Rabba.143 These teachers must have been aware of the attacks made against the law, without or within the community, which could not be allowed to pass in silence. The law is not such an abomination as taught in the Churches, it is the means of cleansing and purifying of sins. It is not a source of contamination, but an ever fresh well of holiness and sanctification. Finally, a sign of love, and not of God's hatred. Even more emphatic are the teachers of the third century (especially after 240), who protested against the Church Fathers' allegations that God forsook Israel, and that the sin of the calf still counted against them. They had to take up cudgels against the pernicious and perverted ideas which arose as a result of accusations against the Synagogue, now generally recognized as false. R. Jonathan ben Eliezer says: "Whosoever performs a commandment in this world, the same precedes him and goes before him in the world to come."144 The Mizwah is an agent for salvation, and not for perdition. R. Jonathan ben Eliezer must have been upset by people who told him that the performance of the commandments deprives man of his future life. Where are these people to be sought, if not in the Gentile-Christian «8 Abot R. N. 141, Makkot III, 16. 135 Gen. r. ch. 41.1, ed. Theodor 424: .לא ניתנו הפצות אלא לצרוף את הבריות בהן ז«° Ed.

Joshua ben Levi faced the same antagonists of the law, when he preached in his synagogue in Lydda: "All the commandments that Jews perform in this world, will rise and testify for them in the world to come."145 Or, when the same teacher uttered his saying: "He who performs Mizwot is as if he had received the Shekina." Observances draw men near to God, and do not drive them far away from Him.146 These sayings are closely connected with the anonymous teaching cited previ ously,14' that God has sown Torah and Mizwot in order to make Israel inherit a share in the future life. The preachers in Tiberias in the sixties and seventies of the third century, R. Levi and R. Isaac, show in some of their homilies and other utterances a special predilection for our problem, which is shared by others as well, e.g. R. Samuel b. Nahmani, who says: "All the good things and blessings, which the prophets saw in this world, were the result of their obedience to the law."148 On similar lines is the teaching of R. Isaac: "He who performs a Mizwah as it ought to be performed will never hear evil tidings, and if evil decrees are passed on him God will nullify the same.149 He further makes God say to Israel: "I did not trouble you for observances."150 The observances are not given as a burden, as an unbearable yoke, but as a joy. Similarly: "He, who loves Mizwot, never gets satiated with them,"151 i.e. the lover of commandments longs for more and more; all the talk about precepts and ordinances being a burden does not apply in reality to law-abiding and God fearing Jews. Let us now turn to R. Levi, in whose Haggadah as we saw152 the perverted theory of the golden calf was more than once refuted. What good comes of observing the law and '«'« B. A.

To the view of the Church that ceremonies and ritual commandments are a punishment for the making of the golden calf, the reply is given that the calf actually caused a shortening of many precepts and the omission of others, which were origi nally intended to be given to Israel.155 Through the making of the calf they lost festivals and Mizwot, and it is not as the Fathers of the Church teach that these were imposed upon them. One may have one's own views as to this method of homoepathic apologetics, but one thing is sure, that R. Levi knew the theories attached to, or derived from, the Bible narrative of the golden calf. The author of the Didascalia endeavors to convince Jewish Christians, who, in common with those from whom the Clemen tine writings emanated, thought very highly of the Sabbath and its uniqueness, and who knew and kept the minutiae of its observance (Rec. 9.28), of the futility of this observance. The following are his two arguments: First of all, if the Sabbath was God's will, then, why were not the old saints of the Bible, before the revelation on Mount Sinai, entrusted with the same? Secondly, why does not God Himself observe this law.156 These questions are of importance for the elucidation of many Haggadic passages and teachings. Yet, before turning to these, it may not be unin teres ting to point out a few Christian writers who developed a similar rabulistic157 with reference to the law of circumcision. In the dispute between the Jew Simon and the Christian The Eccl. r. 1.4: מה הנאה יש לבריות אשר מסגלות במצות ובמעיט. IM Cf. note 139.

MARMORSTEIN [32] ophilus,158 which is contemporary with the Didascalia and the Clementines, the same objection is raised. Why are not Enoch, Noah, Job, or Malkizedek, or even Adam commanded this rite? Because all that God wants is the circumcision of the heart! The answer to this interpretation of the convenant, which is an old argument against Judaism, was given as early as the begin ning of the second century C.E. by R. Ishmael and R. Akiba.159 The anonymous Haggada enumerates a number of persons, among whom the aforementioned Biblical personages are to be found, who are said to have been born circumcised.160 Why was the law of circumcision not given to Adam, or included in the Decalogue? was asked by heathens of many rabbis. So, by Tinaeus Rufus of R. Akiba,161 by Akylas of R. Eliezer b. Hyrkanos,162 by the Matrona of R. Jose b. Halafta,163 and by a philosopher of R. Hoshaya in Caesarea.164 In another homily Abraham asks this question of God.165 In any case we may see in this argument against the circumcision a pagan inheritance on the part of the Church, which lived a long life in the polemics against Sabbath observing Jewish-Christians, and Christians up to the turn of the fourth century. No wonder that the same argument is advanced by the author of the Didascalia against the Sabbath. Why did not the saints and heroes of the Bible observe the Sabbath? One reply can be found in the theory developed in the Haggada that the patriarchs of old kept all the minutiae of the law.166 The Sabbath ■s8 Cf.

Gamaliel and his colleagues from Palestine preached on the subject: Whatever God commands others to do, He does Himself. Thereupon the Min objected: Your God does not keep Sabbath!168 R. Akiba proves to Tinaeus Rufus16' that nature rests on the Sabbath. An anonymous preacher exclaims in his sermon on the Sabbath: "Is it possible that God did work on Sabbath?"170 These instances may suffice to show that both arguments against the Sabbath have been drawn by the author of the Didascalia from pagan sources. Further that they are preserved in the Haggada with a defence of the Jewish standpoint. VI Strenuous efforts were made by the Church to fight Jewish Christians and also Christians who could not free themselves from the "yoke of the commandments." Whether the Rabbis defended the law against Christians for their sake or in order that the poison of antinomism should not penetrate into syna gogues and schools is another question. All rabbis were not so tolerant towards the Posh'e Israel as were R. Simon b. Lakish and R. Simon the Pious, for in spite of their faithfulness to the Law, they succumbed in other respects, apart from their belief in Jesus. Their attitude towards the Holy Scriptures was not the correct Jewish standpoint as taught and dogmatized by the Synagogue. They, as we can see from the Clementines—and they are the most reliable witnesses for the doctrines and feelings of the Palestinian-Syrian Jewish-Christians of the third century— did not accept the Canon of the Holy Scriptures in its entirety. Even parts of the Pentateuch were eliminated as forgeries. Some objectionable stories in the life of the forefathers were simply 16י Mek. 104a, Deut. r. 3.1, R. tfiyya b.

A conception similar to the teaching of the Didascalia that the law of God comprises the Decalogue and the statutes issued before the making of the calf crept into the Clementines {Rec.{Rec. 1.36). No adherent of the Jewish synagogue would go so far as to say: "Or, supposing the expressions in the Scriptures which which which are against God and are unjust and false, to be true, they did not know his real divinity and power" {Horn. 18.19). One notices in perusing the Rabbinic material that in the course of the Tannaitic and Amoraic periods various attitudes to the Holy Scriptures were manifested. First of all a distinction was made between the Decalogue and the rest of the Mosaic legislation, the natural laws on one side and the ritual laws on the other side. Some others accepted the Pentateuch with the exclusion of narratives and stories which for some reason or other did not appeal to them. A third group found it necessary, or convenient, to eliminate Prophets and Hagiographa. A fourth group accorded approval to the Canon of the Holy Scriptures, but did not accept the the authority and binding power of laws and traditions outside these books.171 It is not surprising that R. Simon ben Lakish emphatically deduces from Ex. 24.12 that the Ten Commandments, the whole Pentateuch, all commandments in the Mishna, Prophets and Hagiographa, and the Talmud, all were given to Moses from Heaven.172 Since we know R. Simon ben Lakish's relations to the Posh'e Israel, we can appreciate the motives underlying his elaborate defence of all parts of the Bible and post-Biblical literature. He surely wanted to convince these straying members of the Jewish community that their treatment of the Bible, their differentiation between the different parts of the Torah is not according to the spirit of the law. How far, or whether he sue ceeded at all with his persuasion and with his tolerance, is not recorded. Another teacher of this age, whom we know as spokes man on all problems affecting relations between Judaism and Christianity in the third century C.E., R. Joshua ben Levi,173 171 For a fuller treatment of these movements cf. my article: "Ein fragment einer neuen Piska zum Wochenfest und der Kampf gegen das miindliche Gesetz", in Jeschurun XII, 1925, 34-62. 173 B. Ber. 5a. 173 Cf. above pp. 242 f.</page><page sequence="35">[35][35] JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY 257 affirms the same idea. Bible, Mishna, Halakot, Talmud, Tosefta, Haggadot, even a stray saying by a qualified pupil before his master, is of Sinaitic origin.174 This saying, surely an exaggerated one, must be taken in the apologetic sense in which it was uttered. This teacher's life was, as we know,175 made miserable by Minim, who wearied him with their Bible difficulties, blasphemies and taunting questions, all amounting to the one argument that the Torah has discrepancies, some of which cannot be reconciled. Thereupon, he made his declaration. In an anonymous sermon, R. Joshua ben Levi's teaching is deduced from Ex. 34.27 con nected with Hos. 8.12, quoting the very words of the teacher in Lydda, without his name.176 A full treatment of this subject is contained in a Midrash, which was until lately buried in the dust of the Geniza. Dr. L. Ginzberg177 published a Midrash fragment, which he furnishes with the title, "A Tanhuma-like Midrash to the section לך לך." He overlooked the fact that the author of the Or Zarua, R. Isaac ben Moses of Wien,178 knew this Midrash. Further, that pages (a) and (b) belong to the Pesikta, a Cambridge fragment of which was discovered and published in an article quoted previ ously.17' This Piska, as far as it can be reconstructed, treats the following matters: (1) How many Torot are there? Answer: Two; (2) Differences between the two laws; (3) God offered the Torah to all the nations of the world; (4) (a) Israel accepted the Torah, consequently the covenant is made with them; (b) both are threefold (Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiographa on one side, Midrash, Halakot and Haggadot on the other side), all are of Sinaitic origin. So far the contents of the Piska. No teacher or Haggadist is mentioned in our fragment, which may be a matter of accident owing to its fragmentary state, yet the date may be ascertained by reference to the problem which agitated the contemporaries 174 Eccl. r. 1.29, 5.7, p. 104, pal.

Simon ben Lakish. This century saw among Jews, or Jewish-Christians, a movement which had many forerunners as well as followers who picked and chose, according to their religious beliefs and theological preferences, among parts of the Scriptures, or within a section of them. Needless to say, the radical wing of these factions did away in its entirety with the Oral Law, although the Clementines as well as the Didascalia on the one hand and the Dialogues on the other hand seem to suggest that some Soferic or Rabbinic extensions of some of the laws were observed among the Jewish-Christians whose conduct was a thorn in the sides of some anti-Jewish writers. Yet, some kind of an opposition, most likely as a result of these agitations, crept into Jewish circles and groups, homes and schools. There has to be mentioned a rather strange sentence of R. Adda b. Hanina according to the Babylonian version, or of R. Hunja according to the Palestinian version. The first reads180 אלמלא לא חטאו ישראל לא נותן להם אלא חמשה חומשי תורה וספר יהושע בלבד שערכה של ארץ ישראל הוא, the second181 שאילולי זכו ישראל לא היו קורץ אלא חמשה חומשי תורה ה' ספרים בלבד. The former sentence implies that the books outside the Pentateuch and Joshua were given because of Israel's sin; the latter puts it that were Israel free from guilt they would read no more than the Pentateuch; Prophets and Hagiographa can be considered as punishment for Israel's sin. There can be no doubt, to judge from the passages cited previously, that the sin kolt' è£oxvv was the sin of the calf. In spite of the differences between the two texts and the names of the teachers we can connect them with the teaching of the Didascalia which saw in the "Repetition of the Law" a punish ment. These teachers182 must have heard of the anti-Jewish teachings about the effect of the golden calf, and the law being a punishment. J ust as the contemporary teacher, whose view was recorded before,183 says that not Sabbath and festivals were the 18" B. Ned. 22b. 181 Eccl. r. 1.34. 182 Cf. however Bacher Agada Pal. Am.

It may be taken for granted that the Posh'e Israel rejected Prophets and Hagiographa—the scarcity of quotations from these parts of the Scriptures in the Clementine writings bears out quite eloquently the observations of the Jewish teachers that these people ignored these parts of the Holy Bible. As a result of our investigation, we may establish the follow ing facts. Around the chief seats of Jewish learning and communal activities, like Tiberias and Sepphoris, Caesarea and Lydda, there were scattered about smaller or larger settlements of Jewish-Christians. These stood between two fires, on the one side Jews attacked them for their partly separatistic position, and Christian leanings, on the other hand they were condemned by Gentile-Christians for their Jewish observances and Jewish leanings. These latter consisted of more or less scrupulous obser vance of Sabbath and Festivals, circumcision and dietary law, purity and impurity in the first instance, for which they earned the highest praise in a Jewish teaching of the third century where they are called, "full of observances as a pomegranate." Their interest and attachment to their Jewish brethren is manifested by their longing to share the official fast-day services, of which, probably, some fanatics wanted to deprive them. They most probably took part in the ordinary public services as well as in Synagogue life. On account of all these virtues they were disliked by teachers and bishops of the Church, which is quite natural. The Didascalia follows herein the tradition laid down by Paul, and some of the more intolerant Apostolic fathers. The polemics against these Jewish-Christians developed in a straight line from Paul to the Didascalia, just as the Jewish-Christians kept to their old tradi tions from the earliest days of the Church. Here, however, our task is limited. We have to investigate and describe the position of the Jewish-Christians of the third century with regard to these peculiarities of the sect, namely their observances, around which revolved the three-fold attack of the Gentile-Christian Church, that the Jewish nation was forsaken by God, that the making of</page><page sequence="38">260 A. MARMORSTEIN [38] the calf deprived the Jews of the privileges granted to them and their forefathers in the Holy Scriptures, and, finally, that the Law was given as punishment and chastisement for the trans gression and wickedness of the people. Our material shows clearly that on the whole these points of accusation and attack are a legacy of pagan anti-Jewish polemics and antisemitism, grown on the poison-breeding soil of Alexandria, Caesarea, and other Greek cities. They were adopted and adapted by Christian teachers, who supplied chapters and verses from the Bible. Jewish-Chris tians, rank and file, certainly disliked this method, and defended themselves, as Jews, against these highly pernicious, and, accord ing to impartial judgment, quite unhistorical and unfair doctrines and views. There is not much preserved of their counter-actions, and what is left has come to us in a Gentile-Christian garb and shape. I mean the Clementine writings and the so-called Apostolic constitutions. They teach the very interesting fact that Jewish Christians did not give way without struggle but held in reverence their old traditions and the hallowed forms of their ancestors' liturgy, until they disappeared, either returning to the Synagogue or assimilating with the body of Gentile Christianity. Smaller or larger Jewish-Christian assemblies may have survived in Transjordania or in Syria for some generations, even after Christianity became the successor to pagan gods. We know nothing of them. Anyhow, this possibility accounts for the remarkable fact that preachers and luminaries of the Church harangued their audiences to refrain from visiting Jewish places of worship, from celebrating Jewish festivals, from observances, etc. The jealousy of the triumphant Church cannot be explained otherwise. Eloquent and honey-mouthed orators become stam merers, full of gall when they mention Jews or refer to Judaism in their pulpit utterances or letters. It is no wonder that the preachers of the Synagogue took up the cudgels in this fight for their sacred religion. Since at least some sayings evince interest in these stray members of the Jewish religion, one is right in assuming that teachers were not indifferent about the present attitude and future fate of these Jewish-Christian communities. They hoped to bring them back to the fold, and tried to prevent their drifting away. The misconception of Israel's relation to</page><page sequence="39">[39] JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY 261 God, and God's attitude to Israel, Jewish history and observances, Scriptures and expectations, could not leâve them cold and indif ferent. If the rabbis did not think of the partly alienated Jewish Christians in the first instance, they perceived the gloomy danger looming in the near future for the whole house of Israel. The destroyer was not distant, but very near and able to carry discord and apostasy into Jewish family life and the Synagogues. Two independent witnesses bear out the historical fact that this agita tion against which the teachers of Judaism fought, did not remain without serious consequences. A member of the distinguished family of Hillel, which nominally ruled in Judea and Galilea, was so much attracted by Christian doctrines or advantages accrued by professing them that he embraced Christianity and forsook the religion of his fathers. Similarly, another writer of the Church speaks of the conversion of noble and distinguished Jews about the middle of the third century, and of assisting a Bishop in his functions. These facts can easily be reconciled with the reports to be found in the contemporary Carmen Apolo geticum which breathes pagan and Christianized hatred of Jews and Judaism because high-standing, influential Jews, either in Rome or in the provinces, agitated against Christianity. This must not be understood to mean that Jews instigated a movement for the persecution of Christians, but that they may have pro tected, or at least tried to safeguard, the best interest of their fellow-Jews against apostates and their satellites on the one hand, and against overzealous missionaries on the other hand. In spite of this vehement opposition to Jewish customs and to the Law on the part of many foes and antagonists the attrac tion of Jewish observances prevailed for considerable time in Christianity, no matter whether they were the result of Jewish influence or a more or less shadowy legacy of defunct Jewish Christianity. Every honest student of Rabbinic sources must be puzzled by a saying of R. Simon ben Lakish, whom we recognized as a protector and defender of the Posh'e Israel, namely Jewish Christians, that a pagan who rests on Sabbath is deserving of death.184 How could this teacher derive such a harsh law from 18יי B. Sanh. 58b, ואר'ל עובד כוכבים ששבת חייב סיתה שני ויום ולילה לא ישבתו, cf. Yalfcut Gen. §61 where the full name is given.</page><page sequence="40">262 A. MARMORSTEIN [40] Gen. 8.22 ("day and night shall never cease") ? Who were those pa gan and where are they to be found, who endeavored to solemnize the Sabbath by resting? Finally, what real objection can be raised to Sabbath observance on the part of Gentiles? The situation becomes even more complicated if one consults R. Yohanan, the leader of this age, and a colleague of R. Simon ben Lakish, whose name has been mentioned more than once in the course of this essay, and of whom a similarly strange and perplexing statement about Gentiles engaged in the study of the Torah is recorded.185 In spite of this unfriendly attitude towards gentile students of the Torah, which, by the way, must be taken as a proof that non-Jews tried to learn the Torah, the Written and Oral Law, R. Yohanan opposes R. Simon ben Lakish on the subject of the observation of the Sabbath by Gentiles. One can further recall the strange remark in the Epistle of Peter, that no one who is not circumcised can study the Law,186 which is paralleled by an exactly similar saying of Akyla, in his Dialogue with the Emperor.187 R. Yohanan uttered the saying: "He, who observes the Sabbath according to its rules, even though he be an idolator like the generation of Enosh, is granted forgiveness of sin."188 It is useless, for historical and theological studies, to read new ideas into these quotations, or to minimize their actual contribution to the knowledge of contemporary religious conditions. It remains a fact that Sabbath observance was popular even outside the Jewish communities in Palestine as well as in the Diaspora, where it attained a special significance for the Jewish communities.189 This attraction of the 18י B. Sanh. 59a: עכוים שעוסק בחורה חייב מיתה, cf. however b. Hag. 13a R. Ami, a pupil of and a successor to R. Yohanan says: אי[ מוסרים דברי תורה לעכו'□לעכו'□ ; further the view of R.

It may have been a matter of temperament, but more likely they were guided by actual events, considered and judged in the light of contemporary history. However that may be, we are surely right in assuming that Sabbath observance penetrated the not too wide boundaries of the Jewish congregations. How popular the Sabbath was, can be deduced from the limi tations of work on Sunday on the one hand, and the application of Jewish laws of Sabbath observance, which is condemned and considered as the crime of "judaizare," on the other. The time of Constantine emphasized the law of refraining from manual labour and work. In the year 538 the Jewish mode of observance by not riding on Sabbath, not preparing food or avoiding any adornments of the house, was opposed. Many synods and councils disapproved of the celebration of the day from evening to evening. Altogether the Christian Sunday retained or received a Jewish outlook, and was considered as a successor to the Sabbath of the Old Testament. Some went even further, and made of it a weekly Day of Atonement.190 It shows clearly that the criticism of Early Christianity against the Law generally as well as particu larly could not prevail since the Church had to tolerate, and fight the translation of the Jewish Sabbath into the Christian Sunday for nearly the whole of the first millennium'of its existence. To Judaism the strict adherence to the law gave life and strength to endure, whilst for the Church in her war against her law abiding sections, the victory meant return to barbarism and paganism. 190 Hans v. Schubert, Geschichie der christlichen Kirche in friihen M.A. Tubingen 1920, p. 664. Attention may here be drawn to M. Friedlânder, SynagogeSynagoge und Kirche in ihren Anfangen, Berlin, 1908, pp. 34 ff., who offers conviricing evidence that the observance of the Sabbath gained popularity among pagans in the third century C.E. which was looked upon with con siderable disfavour by the teachers of the Church. May be that R. Simon ben Lakish and R. Yoljanan also had occasion to express their views on this sub ject. Friedlânder would have found confirmation of his theory in the material discussed in the text.</page></plain_text>
