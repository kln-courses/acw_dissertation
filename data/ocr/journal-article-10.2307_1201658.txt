<plain_text><page sequence="1">VAN BUREN, PAUL M. The Burden of Freedom: Americans and The God of Israel. New York: Crossroad Books, Seabury Press, 1976. 114 pp. $6.95. I see basically three aspects to this little volume, even though they do not quite coincide with the author's own chapter divisions. There is, first of all, a very helpful approach to the language of religion, the problem of the relationship between the limitations of human language and God as he really is. (In an effort to be quite "with it," van Buren will occasionally throw in a "She" for God as well.) Within this context, some of the most sensible things we have heard for a long time are said about the supposed problems of "anthropomorphism" and the "personality" of God. The author cuts deftly through centuries of medieval theology-particularly of the Neo- platonic variety-and reaffirms the concreteness of the biblical mode of expression. Against this background, he discusses "The Mystery of God's Freedom." By giving man freedom, God has voluntarily limited his own-as he also has by choosing to link himself with the fate and destiny of Israel. Israel is the second important aspect of this book, with "Israel" including the bibli- cal nation of that name, the Jewish people to the present day, the Christian church, and the modern State of Israel. The conflict between the Church and the Synagogue is fundamentally a "family quarrel," which should never have been aired in public. It is largely due to the Church's historical misunderstanding of the true meaning of the New Testament-a development which, in turn, led to the Synagogue's assuming a defensive position, described by van Buren as a "narrowing" of Judaism. The author 335</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion eloquently calls for a settlement of this family quarrel. He wants Christianity to see its relationship to Judaism essentially in Rosenzweigian terms. With that quarrel out of the way, the "family quarrel" within the church itself, between Rome and Witten- berg, will likewise be assuaged. In making that point, van Buren says some of the nicest things about the Torah (even in its connotation of "Law") which have ever been said by a Christian. The Law secures for Israel that tiny bit of messianic living which is possible in a premessianic world. A Jew could not have put it any better. There is a recurring pattern in Israel's history, marking the interplay of divine and human freedom. The exodus from Egypt leads to desert existence-not to a life of ease. The modern holocaust is followed by the creation of the State of Israel-an embattled enclave in a hostile environment and not complete messianic redemption. Even "The Mystery of Easter" does not mean complete messianic redemption, but only an intimation of it. Man must do his own share in bringing about universal redemption-while God, exercising his freedom, waits for man to do likewise. And with this we come to the third aspect of the book, both explicit and implicit on its every page. Very cleverly, van Buren substitutes "liberation" in any biblical quota- tion where we would normally expect "salvation." In thus stressing the concrete and "this-worldly" component of messianism, the author is on solid biblical ground. Alas, he goes far beyond that. For van Buren is in reality writing a political tract-a kind of "Liberation Theology" in which liberation all too blatantly coincides with Third World propaganda. The author can find nothing good to say about America. There is only Watergate, the CIA, the corporations, and the disadvantaged poor. Even the U.S. Constitution is criticized for guaranteeing the rights of the individual only, that is, for not legislating socialism. Admittedly, the Soviet Union does not fare much better. But the "new Cuba" and the "new China" are held up as shining examples (pp. 72 ff.) of how the "old age" can be overcome and of how the "new age," supposedly preached by the Hebrew prophets, Jesus, and the apostles, can be brought perceptibly nearer. It is not at all clear to me that the path mapped out by God must necessarily lead to Cuban and other Third World dictatorships, or that van Buren's hands are any cleaner disseminating this kind of propaganda than are the hands of the kind of Christianity criticized by him for siding with the Establishment. In fact, a great deal of valuable theology in this book has been vitiated by being made to serve partisan political ends. Withal, The Burden of Freedom is a challenging and eminently readable little volume. JAKOB J. PETUCHOWSKI, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion.</page></plain_text>
