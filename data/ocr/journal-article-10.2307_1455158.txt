In using this nuanced mode of recording incubation dreams, Josephus was able to communicate that the Jews received divine direction under Jaddus with- out implying that God was manipulated to provide a revelation in this crisis. One might observe the same circumspect treatment of dream re- ports in Genesis 28, 46; 1 Samuel 3; and I Kings 3, all of which stand in contrast to typical ancient Near Eastern and Hellenistic dream reports. The author also provides a typology of biblical dream incubation reports: intentional (I Kings 3, Ant 11.326-328), incidental unintentional (Genesis 45, 1 Samuel 3), and accidental unintentional (Genesis 28). In the collected writings of Flavius Josephus' there are thirty- six dream reports or references to dreams.2 Josephus may have had more than a passing interest in dreams. He viewed himself as an accomplished interpreter of dreams (War 3.352), and he claimed that the course of his life was influenced by dreams which he I All citations of Josephus' works are taken from the editions of H.

Dream interpretation was a prophetic skill, but Josephus never calls himself a prophet directly. Josephus states that prophecy ceased in the reign of Artaxerses, king of Persia, "because of the failure of the exact succession of the prophets" (Ap 1.41). Although this statement seems to imply that there were no prophets after that date, Louis Feldman has shown that what Josephus actually meant was that the prophetic succes- sion became difficult to discern, hence subsequent prophets lacked sure authority.3 Josephus admits that John Hyrcanus was a prophet (War 1.68-69, Ant 13.299-300) as well as others, but their abilities were limited (for example, they could not create inspired literature). Overall, Josephus was cautious in using the word "prophet" to describe anyone in the post-biblical period,4 includ- ing himself. Yet he attributed to himself the skills of a prophet. He presented himself as a successor to the prophets in his task as a historian, as a prophet of doom to the Jewish people, and as a predictor of the future.5 He also demonstrated prophetic skills in forms of divination other than dream interpretation. Supposedly he foresaw the ultimate victory of Rome in the Jewish war (War 3.351-354), he saved his life by predicting Vespasian's rise to emperor (3.400-402), and he predicted when the Jotapata defenses would fail (3.406-408). Thus the ability to interpret dreams appears to be another indication of Josephus' prophetic identity, an attri- bution which he could not claim outright. Although a thorough study of dreams in Josephus has not yet appeared, scholars have observed a certain conscious ideological agenda in his description of dream experiences.6 He sought to Ant 17.166; Archelaus, Ant 17.345-348; Glaphyra, Ant 17.349-353; Monobazus, Ant 20.18; Josephus in Galilee, Life 208-210; Stratonice, Ap 1.207; and Amenophis, Ap 1.289. 3 Louis Feldman, "Prophets and Prophecy in Josephus," JTS 41 (1990): 386- 422, especially pp. 400-407. 4Ibid., pp. 389-392. Feldman observed how this contrasted with Josephus' use of the term for individuals in the biblical period: Josephus used the term "prophet" or "prophesy" 169 times where the biblical text lacked either term, and Samuel especially was called "prophet" (45 times), while the Bible only accords him that title in 1 Sam 3:20. David Aune ("The Use of npOop4Trq in Josephus," JBL 101 [1982]: 421) notes that Josephus' reservation about calling himself a prophet paralleled other biblical and classical figures who functioned as prophets yet denied being such. 5 Feldman, "Prophets and Prophecy," p. 404. 6 See the typology of dream reports I provided in "Dream Reports in the Writings of Flavius Josephus," RB 96 (1989): 358-390. Unfortunately I failed to</page><page sequence="3">THE TEMPLE EXPERIENCE OF JADDUS-GNUSE 351 impress upon his audience that dreams were messages from God and could be interpreted only by a prophet. His own interpreta- tion of dreams implied that he, too, was a prophet,8 comparable to Jewish prophets like Joseph, Daniel, and Simon the Essene (who interpreted the dream of Archelaus).9 Such prophets unfolded the meanings of dreams even after pagan divinators had failed. Jo- sephus expands certain biblical accounts of dream interpretation, such as the reports in the Joseph narrative, in which he embellishes the interpretation of the dream images. Perhaps Josephus wished to demonstrate his own ability to interpret dreams by improving upon the interpretations rendered in the biblical text.'0 At one point Josephus adds the notice that Jacob interpreted Joseph's dreams (Ant 2.10-17), an addition which changed the Joseph narratives to imply that Joseph's ability to interpret dreams ex- tended only to others (the butler, the baker, pharaoh) but not to his own dreams. By contrast, Josephus (whose name evokes an association with Joseph) could interpret his own dreams, thus suggesting that a superior oneirocritic ability resided in him. Throughout the dream reports provided by Josephus one senses that dream interpretation is the prerogative of those to whom God has revealed the mysteries of the divine will, and Josephus ranks highly among them. In his role as historian, Josephus saw himself engaging in the function of generating literature comparable to the Latter Prophets.1' He declares that his history would begin where the biblical prophets ended (War 1.18). He also believed that only a prophet could pen sacred history, for divine inspiration was necessary to assure reliability (Ap 1.41).12 By inference his literary include the indirectly reported dream vision of Alexander the Great (Ant 11.334- 335), which was discussed by Shaye Cohen, "Alexander the Great and Jaddus the High Priest according to Josephus," AJS Review 7-8 (1982-83): 41-68. 7 Thomas Franxman, Genesis and the "Jewish Antiquities" of Flavius Josephus (Rome, 1979), pp. 217, 244. 8 Helgo Lindner, Die Geschichtsauffassung des Flavius Josephus im Bellum Judaicum: Gleichzeitig ein Beitrag zur Quellenfrage (Leiden, 1972), pp. 49-68; Joseph Blenkinsopp, "Prophecy and Priesthood in Josephus," JJS 25 (1974): 241-242, 256; and Aune, "Josephus," p. 421. 9 Morton Smith, "The Occult in Josephus," Josephus, Judaism, and Christianity, ed.

However, attributing the skill of dream interpretation to himself provided a certain legitimation as a prophet, even though he was reluctant to call himself by that title. To portray himself as a dream interpreter partially justified his creation of historical literature in the tradition of the Latter Prophets. The narration of dream reports thus played a significant role in his personal self-understanding as a historian and in his account of the experiences of his people. In a previous work I have attempted to demonstrate how Jo- sephus' dream reports fall into the accepted modes of discourse for such religious experiences.'3 Studies in ancient Near Eastern dream reports by A. Leo Oppenheim have characterized theophanic dreams as either "auditory message dreams" or "visual symbolic dreams," 14 and I have applied those categories in assessing biblical dreams.'5 In the Greek world another type of dream report, the "visual-image" or &amp;eiAov, occurs with some frequency.'6 These 13 Gnuse, "Dream Reports," pp. 358-390.

Berchman evaluated the diverse modes of revelation described by Philo and how they related to categories of Hellenistic prophecy and divination, especially the chresmatismos. 14 A.

The classification of dreams and dream reports was undertaken already in the classical world by Daldianus Artemidorus (The Interpretation of Dreams: Oneirocritica, trans. Robert White [Park Ridge, NJ, 1975]), who defined dreams in the categories of dreams, visions, oracles, fantasies or vain imaginations, and apparitions; Gnuse (Dream Theophany,</page><page sequence="5">THE TEMPLE EXPERIENCE OF JADDUS-GNUSE 353 three types of dream formats appear to describe the various reports found in Josephus' writings: (1) Auditory message dreams occur when the divine voice speaks, and visual imagery is nonexistent or very incidental. Such dream reports include those of Abimelech, Jacob at Bethel (in part), Jacob at Beersheba (in part), Amram, Samuel (if it is a dream), Nathan, Solomon (two reports), Jaddus, Theopompos (perhaps), Monobazus (perhaps), and Amenophis (perhaps). (2) Visual symbolic dreams are those wherein a scene is enacted for the dreamer, and the various symbols portend the future once they are interpreted by a prophet or an oneirocritic. Numbered in this category are dreams by Herod (both versions), Archelaus (both versions), Josephus at Jotapata, Joseph (two reports), the butler, the baker, Pharaoh (two reports), the Midian- ite (Judg 7:13), Nebuchadnezzar (two reports), and John Hyrcanus (perhaps). (3) Visual-image dreams visualize the physical image of a person, usually deceased, who stands before the dreamer and speaks. Here are included dreams by Alexander the Great, Gla- phyra (both versions), and Josephus in Galilee; and perhaps some dream image allusions may be observed in the dreams of Jacob at Bethel and at Beersheba, Laban, and Gideon. Even though Jo- sephus did not use clear stereotypical formulas in his reports, the essential form of dream reporting is found in his writings, which implies that he used these ancient literary models at least un- consciously. The evaluation of the thirty-six dream reports reflects the influence of the biblical text upon Josephus' discourse, a ten- dency which becomes most apparent in those accounts which lack a biblical parallel (Amram, Nathan, and Archelaus). Jaddus' Theophany (Ant 11.326-328)17 The experience of Jaddus, the high priest in Jerusalem, likewise demonstrates a high degree of continuity with the biblical tradi- tion. Here the similarity extends to more than just the dream p. 41); and Berchman ("Arcana mundi," pp. 397-398) who also provided his own modern typology of Hellenistic dream reports (pp. 386-388). 17 Cohen ("Alexander the Great," pp. 41-68) gave an excellent analysis of the greater context in which this account is found, although his emphasis was upon Alexander's dream as an "epiphany story," and the relationship of Alexander to Jaddus and the Jews as an "adventus story."</page><page sequence="6">354 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW report format. Jaddus' experience appears to involve dream incu- bation, and Josephus treats the account in the same discreet and ambiguous fashion in which biblical authors present dream incu- bations in the Hebrew text. Of the various dreams reported in Josephus, this one contains more characteristics of dream incubations than other reports. When Alexander the Great advanced upon Jerusalem, Jaddus feared the encounter because of past political relations with Alex- ander. He called for public prayer and offered public sacrifice. After the sacrifice Jaddus went to sleep, and God spoke oracularly (?XPp6 l?V)18 to him. God commanded him to adorn the city and go forth to meet Alexander. The people should wear white garments and the priests should bedeck themselves with their formal robes. Jaddus then awoke from his sleep and announced to everyone the revelation. The general pattern for the account is: (1) sacrifice and prayer, (2) sleep in a sacred place, (3) a divine theophany-a dream, (4) awakening, (5) public proclamation, and (6) fulfillment of divine directives (which are recorded in Ant 11.329-339). Although the account does not mention the notion of dream incubation, the activities of the high priest appear to imply it strongly. He offered a sacrifice prior to sleeping in a sacred shrine, both of which are hallmarks of dream incubation. The experience is described as Kataa toi; i'utvou;, an expression used elsewhere in Josephus to describe dream theophanies."9 After awakening from 18 From Xpi1gatiCo, a verb which means "to handle a matter," and a term used frequently in reference to revelation. In Ant 3.212 Moses was "instructed" (9Xp1,9atic,to) by God, and in the dream reports of the Matthean infancy narra- tives the wise men (Xpi1gatcrto v-rF, Matt 2:12) and Joseph (XpigatctOcqi, Matt 2:22) were "instructed" by a dream (icar' ovap), Bo Reicke, "Xpfiga, XpilgarKio, Xp1itatctr[to," Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, ed.

Hence this dream may be classified tentatively as an auditory message dream, especially since there is an oral message with no apparent reference to visual phenomena. The dream of</page><page sequence="7">THE TEMPLE EXPERIENCE OF JADDUS-GNUSE 355 the dream, Jaddus announced (ppjatta06v)20 its content to the people. The text sounds as though the assembled crowd had waited anxiously at the Temple for the high priest to appear and proclaim the message. The terse nature of the text in Josephus makes it difficult, however, to discern with certainty whether Jaddus pro- claimed it to an assembled crowd or told it repeatedly to smaller groups at a later date. The tenor of the text leads the reader to assume that the announcement was made subsequent to the theophany, and plans were undertaken immediately to fulfill the divine directive in view of the impending arrival of the Macedonian army. If such was indeed the case, the assembled crowd must have anticipated that divine revelation would be forthcoming to the high priest. Taken together, all these characteristics make the account appear to be a deliberate incubational experience. Critics have suspected that this event never really occurred.21 Whether or not this event took place historically is irrelevant; the question is whether Josephus describes this account as a dream incubation. If so, why does his account not indicate more clearly dream incubation procedures? The answer may be found in part by recourse to narratives in the Hebrew Bible, where similar accounts of dream incubation are recorded, but the texts leave the matter of actual incubation ambiguous. The biblical writers were reluctant to record deliberate dream incubation, and possibly later editorial censorship has removed such references.22 This mode of reporting was consciously or unconsciously adopted by Josephus. In general, Josephus sought to avoid pagan references or to define biblical phenomena (such as prophets) differently from their Hellenistic counterparts.23 This same caution, however, was not characteristic of Jewish contemporaries of Josephus, such as Philo and other Amenophis (Ap 1.289), in particular, appears to be an incubation dream, and that of Alexander (Ant 11.334-335) in a shrine at Dium or Dion also may be one. Since post-biblical uses of the term 'Sltvou4 are limited by Josephus to the experiences of Jaddus, Alexander, Hyrcanus, and Amenophis, we might conclude that the term is used with incubational experiences. 20 Perhaps the word is used again because the human agent is repeating the message of God to the audience. 21 Blenkinsopp, History of Prophecy, p. 260. 22 Ernst Ludwig Ehrlich, Der Traum in Alten Testament (Berlin, 1953), pp. 18-19; and Thomas McAlpine, Sleep, Divine and Human, in the Old Testament (Sheffield, Eng., 1978), p. 178. 23 Feldman, "Prophets," pp. 416-417.</page><page sequence="8">356 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW pseudepigraphic authors, who described fantastic dream visions received in dramatic fashion. Josephus was fairly conservative in presenting biblical accounts and preserving their original form.24 A consideration of biblical dream reports with incubation might enlighten our perception of Josephus' continuity with the earlier biblical traditions. Dream Incubation Before considering the biblical texts something should be said about dream incubation in the ancient world, for the biblical texts were shaped in the context of customs which were pervasive throughout the ancient Near Eastern world, and their degree of difference from contemporary texts may reflect specific theological values. A dream incubation is an activity in which an individual goes to a shrine or a sacred site and engages in some ritual activity (which may include sacrifice and self-purification) in order to obtain a revelation from the deity. It is this act of deliberately seeking a revelation from the deity which would offend biblical authors, especially the prophets,25 for such actions, like divination, seek to force God to speak by human manipulation. The most developed incubation reports come from classical sources, especially those associated with the cult of Asclepius, wherein devotees sought also physical healing. The earliest references to incubation are found in Mesopotamia as early as the third millennium BCE.26 Here the priest would go to the sanctuary, offer a sacrifice, pray, and sleep in the cella of the deity with the hope of receiving a dream. In the mythic literature 24 H. W. Basser ("Josephus as Exegete," JAOS 107 [1987]: 21-30) concluded that Josephus "organized related but scattered biblical passages," and "adds nothing significant to the text which cannot be justified by an exegesis of some passage" (p. 30). 25 Gnuse, Dream Theophany, pp. 85-88. 26 Baruch Margalit (The Ugaritic Poem of AQHT [New York, 1989], pp. 262- 263) challenged whether the reports from the ancient Near East can be termed incubation dreams, since they lack references to the characteristic actions recorded in classical incubation experiences. Although his analysis is extremely insightful, his critique may be too stringent, for the problem lies with the terse nature of ancient Near Eastern records which would not include all the aspects of a dream incubation ceremony.</page><page sequence="9">THE TEMPLE EXPERIENCE OF JADDUS-GNUSE 357 we hear of Ziusudra who "prostrates himself in humility [and] stands in attendance [at the shrine]."27 In historical records Gudea received a symbolic message dream and then incubated a second dream to interpret the first.28 Naram-Sin is said to have attempted dream incubation by self-purification, lament to the gods, and sleeping in bed.29 An Akkadian psalm of lament records the be- liever's plea to receive a favorable dream after incubation: Send me that I may see a favorable dream. The dream I see, may it be favorable. The dream I see, may it come true. The dream I see, turn it into favor.30 Dream reports abound in the later Assyrian period (seventh century BCE), and include references to incubation. The goddess Ishtar spoke of the incubation of Ashurbanipal when she said, "Inasmuch as you have lifted your hands in prayer and your eyes are filled with tears, I have mercy."31 Dreams are incubated by a priest also under Ashurbanipal.32 Good examples of incubation come from Ugarit (late second millennium BCE) in a cultural sphere closer to Israel. In the epic literature, Keret's experience is described in several lines (KRT A:I, lines 26-30).33 Keret enters a chamber, weeps, and prays; finally the god El appears to him. More complete is the report of Dan'el's incubation in the Aqhat Epic (2 AQHT I, lines 3-18).34 27 Alexander Heidel, The Gilgamesh Epic and Old Testament Parallels (Chicago, 1946), p. 103. 28 Wolfgang Hempel, "Gudea's Fated Brick," JNES 46 (1987): 205. 29 Hans Gustav Guterbock, "Die historische Tradition und ihre literarische Gestaltung bei Babylonieren und Hethitern bis 1200," Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie 94 (1938): 56-57. 30 Ehrlich, Der Traum, p. 52; and Oppenheim, Interpretation, p. 250. 31 James Pritchard, ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testa- ment, 3rd ed.

However, Margalit (AQHT, pp. 260-266) again challenged whether this can be termed dream incubation, for it lacks the fuller rituals found in later</page><page sequence="10">358 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Dan'el provides food and drink offerings to the gods, which he eats himself. He enters a special chamber and puts on special clothing. He repeats the process for seven days while exhibiting doleful expressions to appear wretched before the gods. Finally Baal intercedes on his behalf before El to grant him children. The best examples of incubation are found in Greece, especially in the cult of Asclepius. For centuries Greeks, and later Romans, sought the aid of this deity by way of pilgrimage to shrines at Cos, Trica, Pergamum, Lebedena, and Aegae.3s Devotees would spend one or more days in the shrine (even receiving medicinal remedies), and at night they would hope for a dream or dream-like appear- ance of the god to heal them. Asclepius would come and administer normal medical procedures or use bizarre magical cures, some- times with snakes or dogs, which were sacred to him. The pattern of dream incubation in these shrines may be found also in sacred sites devoted to other healing deities in the classical world, such as Isis, Serapis, and Apollo. In all instances, the devotee would offer a sacrifice, pray, lament, and sleep in the shrine upon particular bedding materials, often wearing a special garment. The entire process was necessary for the effectiveness of the dream incuba- tion. Customs were much the same as those practiced in the ancient Near East for millennia, but the classical authors provide us with more details. Reports of healing were often displayed publicly in inscriptions posted at Asclepian shrines, and they de- scribed the often strange (sometimes trivial) ailments, the bizarre and miraculous appearances of the deity, and the responses of the devotees who were healed. Some devotees were healed even though they lacked faith in the ability or the will of the god to heal them, thus heightening the magical power attributed to the healing pro- cess at the shrines.36 classical sources. One could respond by saying that the AQHT poem should not be expected to flesh out the rituals in the detail comparable to later sources. 35 The best collection of accounts is found in Ludwig and Emma Edelstein, eds., Asclepius: A Collection and Interpretation of the Testimonies (Baltimore, 1945): 1: 1-452, 2: 1-257. Cf.

Offensive characteristics would include the notion of healing without the component of faith on the part of the devotee, the extremely anthropomorphic portrayal of the deity (with dogs and snakes no less), and the general perception that the devotee could bring the deity down for even trivial medical reasons. If Josephus was familiar with such reports, his portrayal of the experience of Jaddus in very simple and respectful fashion would reflect his way of reacting negatively to the Greek mode of describ- ing dream incubations. Thus Josephus' portrayal of the Jaddus experience may have been influenced by two factors: (1) a negative reaction to well- known incubation accounts in the Hellenistic world, and (2) the portrayal of incubation in the Hebrew Bible. It was the latter that may have influenced more positively the style of his portrayal. Hence, we now turn to the biblical texts.37 Biblical Parallels Foremost among the biblical texts for consideration is the the- ophany to Solomon in 1 Kings 3 (= 2 Chronicles 1), which appears to be the best candidate for a dream incubation. It contains several criteria proposed for defining a true incubation: (1) the desire to receive revelation, (2) revelation during sleep, (3) revelation at a shrine or sacred site, and (4) the performance of specific prepara- 38 tory rites. Solomon went to Gibeon, an ancient shrine, to offer a 3 Dream incubation continued into the Christian era with people sleeping at martyr's tombs. Ludovicus Deubner (De incubatione [Leipzig, 1900], pp. 56-109), recorded a number of them, and the old pattern remains: pilgrimage to sacred site, rites of preparation, prayer, sleep, and theophany. 38 Deubner, Incubation, pp. 5-6, and Ehrlich, Der Traum, pp. 13, 20. Commen- tators have frequently defined this experience as such: Ehrlich, Der Traum, pp. 19- 27, and idem., Biblisch-historisches Handworterbuch, s.v. "Traum"; John Gray, I &amp; II Kings (Philadelphia, 1970), p. 124; and Moshe Weinfeld, Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School (Oxford, 1972), pp. 250-25 1. Johannes Lindblom ("Theophanies in Holy Places in Hebrew Religion," HUCA 32 [1961]: 104-105) and Helen Kenik (Design for Kingship: The Deuteronomistic Narrative Technique in I Kings 3:4-15 [Chico, CA, 1983], p. 182) both expressed strong reservations about calling it an incubation. However, its parallels with ancient Near Eastern</page><page sequence="12">360 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW sacrifice. 2 Chron 1:3-5 and Josephus (Ant 8.22) both add that Solomon sacrificed upon Moses' bronze altar, which implies even greater significance for Solomon's actions. After offering the sacri- fice, Solomon slept at the site, and God appeared to him in a dream by night (71n59;1 t13ft). The Hebrew conforms rather closely to dream theophany reports in Genesis (Abimelech, Jacob at Bethel, Jacob at Laban's home, Laban, and Jacob at Beersheba) and in Numbers (Balaam).39 In Josephus' version (Ant 8:22) God appears to Solomon in his sleep during the night ((pavsi; Y7p ai'Jti) KaLat toy;q Ditvo; -rij; VUKto;), a formula which appears to have been influenced by the Hebrew expressions used throughout the various dream reports. God asks Solomon what he desires, and after a pious response on Solomon's part (which sounds very Deuteronomistic40), God grants him wisdom and wealth. The He- brew text records a clear termination: "Solomon awoke, and be- hold, it was a dream" (rn' n nimi Mn*w rPj2'1), a formula found in other dream reports (Gen 20:8, 28:16, 41:7). Josephus states that Solomon "leaped from his bed" (avFnti6i?aFv) (as did Herod at the end of his dream in War 1.328) and did obeisance. Solomon then went to Jerusalem, offered another sacrifice, and had a feast for his servants. The Hebrew text does not call this cultic activity of Solomon a deliberate dream incubation; it leaves that matter ambiguous. But scholars have suspected that it might have been such, especially in light of his deliberate action of going to a sacred site and offering a sacrifice. What else would have been Solomon's intent if not to obtain a revelation from God? The parallel version in 2 Chron 1:6 states that Solomon and his assembly "sought the Lord." Further- more, the experience is repeated by Solomon at a later date. 1 Kgs 9:2 states that God appeared to Solomon at Gibeon a second time as before. Josephus at this point provides a more detailed version of the second theophany, which is clearly characterized as a dream (ovap) while Solomon slept. With this return to the sacred shrine and a second revelation, one suspects even more the deliberate nature of the dream incubation. Yet the author of the biblical text dreams has been established: Kenik, Kingship, pp. 177-182; and Gnuse, Dream Theophany, pp. 81-84. 39 Kenik, Kingship, pp. 177-182; and Gnuse, Dream Theophany, pp. 74-84. 40 Kenik, Kingship, pp. 57-173.</page><page sequence="13">THE TEMPLE EXPERIENCE OF JADDUS-GNUSE 361 remains equally reluctant in this second reference to admit it, to the extent of even omitting the formulaic language for dream theophanies. Comparison with Egyptian royal literature leads us to suspect further that dream incubation was reported in an earlier oral or literary form of the text of 1 Kings 3 (if there is no historical memory behind the text). Scholars have observed the similarities between the "Royal Novellas" of pharaohs like Thutmosis IV and Merneptah, and 1 Kings 3-11, the "Court History of Solomon."41 In these novellas an Egyptian pharaoh records the significant military and cultural accomplishments of his reign, prefaced by a dream theophany in which the patron deity confirms the candidate for pharaoh, and the new pharaoh subsequently announces his divine mandate to rule and provides a feast for the servants. The most noted example is that of Thutmosis IV, who received a dream theophany in the shadow of the sphinx.42 (However, it might be observed that Thutmosis' actions make it appear that the dream was the result of unintentional incubation.) At any rate, those who formulated the literary text of 1 Kings 3-11 crafted chapter 3 as a dream theophany to introduce the record of Solomon's accom- plishments, and the text may be describing the actions of Solomon as deliberate incubation at an early stage in its oral or literary development. In this way Solomon would have been portrayed like the pharaohs, either because the document was used in some court ritual43 or because those who generated this literature created a 41 Siegfried Herrmann ("Die Konigsnovelle in Agypten und Israel: Ein Beitrag zur Gattungsgeschichte in den Geschichtsbuchern des Alten Testaments," Wissen- schaftliche Zeitschrift der Karl Marx Universitat, Leipzig 3 [1953-54]: 51-62) has provided the best articulation, although it was first noted by Alfred Hermann, Die agyptische Konigsnovelle (Hamburg, 1938). This position has been followed by several scholars: Tryggve Mettinger, Solomonic State Officials (Lund, 1971), p. 150; Eric William Heaton, Solomon's New Men (New York, 1974), pp. 21-22; and Manfred Gorg, Gott-Konig-Reden in Israel und Agypten (Stuttgart, 1975), pp. 54- 268. Ehrlich (Der Traum, pp. 24-25) observed the connection only between the dream of Solomon and its Egyptian counterparts; and Kenik (Kingship, pp. 27-32, 42-43) perceived the relationship to be merely literary, with no actual political functions as analogs in both cultures. 42 Oppenheim, Interpretation, pp. 188, 191, 251; and Gnuse, Dream Theophany, pp. 27-28. 4' Herrmann, "K6nigsnovelle," pp. 54-56; and Georg Fohrer, "Der Vertrag zwischen Konig und Volk in Israel," ZAW 71 (1959): 7; and idem., History of Israelite Religion, trans.

The deliberate na- ture of Solomon's incubation might have been toned down by subsequent editorial revision, perhaps by the Deuteronomistic his- torians, whose influence certainly may be observed in the speech of Solomon (1 Kings 8) and the divine response.45 For by Deuter- onomistic standards deliberate incubation would appear as an attempt to manipulate God and would impinge upon divine free- dom and majesty.46 Recently some scholars have doubted whether 1 Kings 3-11 is actually modeled after Egyptian royal novellas.47 These observa- tions are good, but they do not eliminate the possibility that material in 1 Kings 3-11 parallels Egyptian literary texts; it simply means that the biblical text as a whole ought not to be called a "royal novella." It still remains true that the dream in 1 Kings 3 reflects the influence of international styles of dream reporting. Choon Seow, who questioned the "royal novella" theory, none- theless provided a further argument to support the notion that dream incubation is occurring in this text. Seow believed that West-Semitic sources provide better parallels with 1 Kings 3-11 than do Egyptian sources.48 In particular, he highlighted the paral- lels between Solomon's experience and those in Ugaritic literature, especially the dream of Keret. He noted the following similarities: (1) Both conform to the pattern of sacrifice, sleeping in a shrine, and a feast after the reception of the theophany. (2) The narrative moves from a situation of need to the promise of a dream and subsequent realization of that promise. (3) Human beings are given the opportunity to make a request of the deity, and they ask for something other than wealth or power. Keret may actually state that he does not wish those things (the text is fragmentary), whereas God mentions that these things were not the request of 44 Otto Eissfeldt, The Old Testament: An Introduction, trans.

(4) Both terminate with the formulaic expression, "X awoke, and it was a dream."49 Thus one may conclude that the incubational dream report of Solomon is modeled after an even earlier tradition in Ugaritic literature. The lack of reference to incubation may reflect caution on the part of the biblical author.50 It is interesting to note that Seow's consideration of the Keret text led him to reject this as an example of incubation, because it lacks a clear reference to incubation and the attendant rituals.5" Perhaps even the Ugaritic texts may display a reluctance to speak directly of dream incubation out of respect for the gods. In short, evidence from West-Semitic sources as well as Egyptian literature supports the conjecture that Solomon's experience was one of deliberate dream incubation. If so, the biblical text disguises that action lest it appear offensive in regard to the Israelite view of God. This may have been due to the work of the Deuteronomists, or the text may have been crafted as such at its inception by an author who desired a dream theophany legitimation for Solomon but needed to temper the description for theological reasons. 1 Kings 3 is the best analogy for comparison with Josephus' rendition of the dream theophany received by Jaddus. Both appear to be deliberate incubations, but neither is described as such in the text. In both variations the plot demands that the dramatic per- sonage receive a divine revelation at the appropriate moment, but the "hand of God" cannot be forced. So the authors create a situation in which a dream theophany comes at the convenient time, but they circumspectly avoid the implication that incubation was the successful tool by which revelation was obtained. Valuable in our consideration are the biblical texts recounting Jacob's dreams at Bethel and Beersheba, both of which have been considered examples of dream incubation.52 Some have viewed the 4' F. Charles Fensham, "Legal Aspects of the Dream of Solomon" (Fourth World Congress of Jewish Studies [Jerusalem, 1967], p. 67) additionally observed that sacrifice took place after the dream theophany in both accounts (Keret and Solomon); Kenik (Kingship, p. 180) also noted some of these similarities. 50 Ehrlich, Der Traum, pp. 18-19; Weinfeld, Deuteronomy, pp. 253-254; and Seow, "Syro-Palestinian Context," p. 146. 5 Seow, "Syro-Palestinian Context," p. 147. Cf. Ehrlich (Der Traum, pp. 43-44) who voiced the same guarded opinions. 52 Ehrlich (Der Traum, pp. 13-55) discussed all the biblical texts which might demonstrate incubation (1 Kgs 3:5-15, Gen 28:10-29:1, Gen 46:1-5, Gen 15, 1 Sam 3, and Isa 65:4 in order of comparative value), and decided that only Solomon's</page><page sequence="16">364 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Bethel experience (Gen 28:10-22) as an example of "unintentional dream incubation."53 It has been suggested that Jacob incubated the dream inadvertently by sleeping upon the stone.54 Certainly Jacob was unaware that this was a holy site when he selected it for lodging." Clearly he did not engage in any ritual preparation for the dream theophany. Although the term "unintentional dream theophany" is a modern term used to classify such ancient expe- riences, it may be an apt category to distinguish it from other religious experiences.56 While some commentators might likewise classify Jacob's experience at Beersheba (Gen 46:1-4) as uninten- tional dream incubation, there appear to be some differences in this account. Jacob seems to have known that this site was sacred, for he offered a sacrifice to the "God of Isaac." Was Jacob merely passing through this site, or did he deliberately go there for a revelation? The text is vague on this matter. But contrasting the two accounts leads us to observe that while Jacob did not know that Bethel was a sacred site, he had to be aware of the status of Beersheba. Two of the more significant components of dream incubation are present in this narrative: preliminary sacrifice and sleeping in a sacred place. Thus some have called this an example of dream incubation, or at least something close to it.57 Yet the experience constituted a good example of incubation; Gnuse (Dream Theophany, pp. 149-152) discussed Samuel's experience in 1 Sam 3 as possible incubation. 53 Rudolph Smend, Lehrbuch der Alttestamentlichen Religionsgeschichte (Leip- zig, 1893), p. 39; John Skinner, Genesis (Edinburgh, 1910), p. 376; Aage Bentzen, Introduction to the Old Testament (Copenhagen, 1948), 1:186; Theodor Gaster, Thespis: Ritual, Myth, and Drama in the Ancient Near East (New York, 1950), p. 271; idem., Encyclopaedia Judaica s.v. "Dreams: In the Bible"; and Isaac Mendelsohn, Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible, s.v. "Dream." 54 Smend, Lehrbuch, p. 39; Skinner, Genesis, p. 376; and Morris Jastrow, Aspects of Religious Belief and Practice in Babylonia and Assyria (New York, 1911), p. 266. 5 Thus McAlpine (Sleep, p. 159) called this account the discovery of a shrine rather than the incubation of a dream. Ehrlich (Der Traum, p. 32) believed that this lack of awareness disqualifies this as an incubational dream. 56 Here the author has changed his position from the earlier viewpoint expressed in Gnuse, Dream Theophany, pp. 67-68, where "unintentional incubation dreams" were rejected as a category for discussion. 57 Anton Jirku, "Ein Fall von Inkubation im Alten Testament (Ex 38:8)," ZAW 33 (1913): 153; Edouard Paul Dhorme, L'Evolution religieuse d'Israel; vol. 1: La Religion des Hebreux nomades (Brussels, 1937), p. 232; Mendelsohn, "Dream," p. 868; and Gaster, "Dreams," p. 208. Josephus' version of this account makes it</page><page sequence="17">THE TEMPLE EXPERIENCE OF JADDUS-GNUSE 365 account falls short of the deliberate actions of Solomon, for when Jacob ultimately passed through Beersheba on his way to Egypt, he did not go directly to this shrine with the intent of receiving divine guidance, as did Solomon at Gibeon, nor does the text imply that he sought a dream from God. On the other hand, if a person sleeps in a sacred place without the express intention of receiving a dream theophany, yet apparently desires divine con- tact, can we speak of these actions as "unintentional"? Jacob goes to Beersheba because it is a holy place; and his "unintentional dream incubation" here seems far less "unintentional" than his experience at Bethel. Even though our texts are too terse and vague to permit us to draw unambiguous conclusions, the hypothetical consideration of the differences which might exist between Jacob's experience at Bethel and Beersheba leads us to an important distinction. There is a difference between "unintentional dream incubation" when a person does not know that he or she is in a holy place, and those instances in which a person spends time at a sacred site, even though dream incubation is not the intended activity. The latter would describe the activity of Samuel in 1 Samuel 3 where he was not seeking a theophany on that particular night, but since he regularly slept in the shrine, he should have been open to the possibility of such an event at any time, as Eli finally realized and impressed upon him. 58 Thus we might formulate the following typology for dreams at holy places: (1) Intentional dream incubation describes those situa- tions when the recipient engages in specific actions, such as prayer and sacrifice, prior to sleeping in a shrine with the purpose of receiving a divine theophany. (2) Incidental unintentional dream incubation refers to those instances when the recipient spends time in a sacred shrine where dream incubation, as well as other forms of divine revelation, may occur, but does not engage in procedures specifically designed to elicit a theophany. (The recipient may or may not anticipate a divine message at some indefinite point in the future.) (3) Accidental unintentional dream incubation describes appear even more like an incubation by virtue of Jacob's emotional state (Ant 2.172-176). McAlpine (Sleep, p. 159) considered the text as suggestive of incuba- tion, but was dubious, since the term for dream is replaced by vision. 58 Gnuse, Dream Theophany, pp. 149-150.</page><page sequence="18">366 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW those experiences when the recipient receives a dream theophany unaware of the power of the place to produce a divine theophany, and did not expect a message from the divine realm. In the first category would belong those accounts where we suspect deliberate incubation: the two theophanies of Solomon at Gibeon and Josephus' account of Jaddus. Perhaps here we should include also those vague allusions in the Psalms to possible acts of dream incubation (Psalms 3, 4, 17, and perhaps also 5, 11, 27, 57, 63, 101), since one would surmise that pilgrimage to a shrine, such as the Temple in Jerusalem, would be undertaken by those seeking a theophany and prepared to engage in appropriate rituals.59 But consideration of the material in the Psalms warrants a separate detailed study in this regard. In the second category would belong the experiences of Samuel at Shiloh and perhaps of Jacob at Beersheba. In the final category would be the experience of Jacob at Bethel. This typology also reveals further the continuity between the dream experiences as they are described for Solomon and Jaddus. One cannot help but suspect that Josephus may have been describ- ing the experience of Jaddus to resemble somewhat that of Solo- mon. In both accounts we have the following similarities:60 (1) Sacrifice and prayer function as prelude to the theophany;61 (2) sleep in a holy place or shrine is undertaken at a propitious moment; (3) significant dialogue between God and the recipient occurs (although Jaddus does not speak to God directly as does Solomon); (4) formulaic language is used to describe the dream experience, including dream references and formal termination; 5 Numerous scholars have proposed that allusions in the Psalms refer to dream incubation: Sigmund Mowinckel, Psalmenstudien (Oslo, Kristiania, 1921-24), 1:154-156; Hans Birkeland, Die Feinde des Individuums in der israelitischen Psalmenliteratur (Oslo, 1933), pp. 335-336; Gustav Widengren, The Accadian and Hebrew Psalms of Lamentation as Religious Documents (Uppsala, 1936), pp. 28, 256-257, 263, 291; Lindblom, "Theophanies," pp. 104-105; and more recently the issues have been raised by K. van der Toorn ("Ordeal procedures in the Psalms and the Passover meal," VT38 [19881: 427-435) who suggested that dream incubation was part of a juridical ordeal; and Th. Booij, "Psalm ci 2-'When wilt thou come to me?"' VT 38 (1988): 458-462. 60 Ehrlich (Der Traum, pp. 26-27) provided a brief comparison of these two texts. 61 Ibid., p. 27. Ehrlich noted that in both instances it is unclear whether the recipient desired a dream theophany or another form of revelation.</page><page sequence="19">THE TEMPLE EXPERIENCE OF JADDUS-GNUSE 367 (5) subsequent public proclamation of the theophany by the re- cipient is reported; and (6) some form of public rejoicing occurs in response to the revelation. Conclusion Why would Josephus consciously or unconsciously cast the experience of Jaddus in a form reminiscent of dream incubation theophanies, and in particular the experience of Solomon? Jo- sephus wished to describe the response of the Jewish community to Alexander the Great and to the fall of Persia, and he desired to demonstrate that their actions were divinely directed at this dra- matic juncture in human history. One would expect these special persons to act with divine guidance, and it was forthcoming to lead the people to accept Greek hegemony over themselves. Thus this submission to a foreign power was not a human decision prompted by cowardice or a lack of faith in God; it was the will of God.62 The account of Jaddus was probably a literary fiction generated out of old pious memories.63 Therefore Josephus had some flexi- bility in how he cast the narrative, but describing the theophany was a delicate matter. Incubated dreams were common in the Hellenistic world, especially in the cults of healing deities. It was important for Josephus to describe the theophany of Jaddus in a fashion more dignified than those found in Hellenistic shrine in- scriptions. The terse and circumspect treatment of the narrative leaves the listener or reader unsure of whether this was truly dream incubation. The ambiguity in the text is by design, and the re- sultant presentation resembles dream reports in the Hebrew Bible, especially those of Solomon, for he was another person of high rank who functioned in an official capacity for the people of God.64 Like the biblical authors before him, Josephus would not let his narratives violate his beliefs. Although the plot of both 1 Kings 3 and Ant 11.326-328 require dream incubation to ensure that a divine message and affirmation be given at the appropriate mo- ment, to declare that God responded immediately upon human 62 Cohen, "Alexander," p. 53. 63 Blenkinsopp, Prophecy, p. 260. 64 Ehrlich (Der Traum, pp. 26-27) stressed how they both fall short of royal status, since Solomon was not yet confirmed as king. But this may be stretching the argument too much.</page><page sequence="20">368 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW demand would be blasphemous. Dream incubation flirts with such blasphemy; it implies a God who is manipulated by crass divina- tion. Therefore, the biblical authors and Josephus crafted texts in which God comes at the proper time out of free will due to the divine compassion for the chosen people. To this end dream incu- bation must be portrayed in subtle, almost nonexistent, fashion. Dream incubation must not quite seem to be real dream incuba- tion; the text must be as it is without revealing exactly what it is. Here the craft of historian, literary artist, and theologian is woven together in delicate fashion by Josephus.</page></plain_text>
