<plain_text><page sequence="1">TIlE BIRDS OF ARIZoNA. By Allan Phillips, Joe Marshall, and Gale Monson. University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1964; 91/? X 12 in., xviii + 220 pp. $15.00. At last, those who are concerned with birds in the Southwest have an accurate and authoritative volume covering a major part of the region. Although possessing one of the largest avifaunas of any state, Arizona has had no book treating its entire bird life. For many years-until early in 1964-there was not even an up-to-date checklist available. The annotated list which appeared that year as Part 4 of Lowe's "The Vertebrates of Arizona" was written by Monson and Phillips and was based on the same data that appear in the present volume. Some of the wording is exactly the same in both works. UJsers of both will note, however, that whereas the checklist employed nomenclature of the fifth edition of the A.O.U. Check-list, there are numerous departures from this in "The Birds of Arizona." The book opens attractively with a colored frontispiece (by W. J. Schaldach) depicting a pair of Masked Bobwhites with golden-leaved cottonwoods and Baboquivari Peak in the background. Following a two-page preface by Guy Emerson is a table of contents, a list of museums referred to in the text, and an introduction by Marshall stating clearly the aims of the book and role of each author. Five well-illustrated pages of habitat in- formation (with a sad commentary on man's destructive activities) by Monson and Phillips, and a map, precede the 212-page text. The latter treats each of the 423 species admitted to the Arizona list by the authors' strict criteria. (However, if A.O.U. Check-list nomenclature were here followed the species list would be longer.) Forms of hypothetical occurrence are not numbered as are the others, but are included</page><page sequence="2">December 1966 ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 485 Vol. 78, No.448 in brackets in their customary taxonomic position. Subspecies receive considerable atten- tion lbut are treated within each species account. Space devoted to one species varies from five or six lines (e.g., Blue-footed Booby) to more than two pages (Screech Owl). The pages carry double columns of print and, very often, an outline map showing the Arizona distribution of one or more Arizona species or subspecies. Each family is introduced by an interesting general summary of the group as repre- sented in Arizona, with occasional comments on remarkable habits or structure of extra- limital forms; these introductory discussions are largely by Monson. Two groups, the hummingbirds and Empidonax flycatchers have keys for specimen identification that will assist the bird-bander or anyone with a dead bird to name. Phillips' Empidonax key is more satisfying to use than any other heretofore available. Nevertheless, as the author states, it will not work 100 per cent of the time. (I might add that if a specimen won't "key out" here it is sufficiently interesting to warrant preservation; too many inexperi- enced banders continue to ring Empidonax flycatchers recorded positively as one species or another. It is not that easy.) The hummingbird key is useful only in a very general way, not permitting final distinction between, say, females of the two Archilochus species, or those of Selasphorus. But it does permit narrowing down the number of species to which an unknown individual mav belong. Marshall's introduction reveals that the book's aim is to "tell exactly where and when each kind of Arizona bird can be found and to remark what is interesting about it in Arizona." It tries "to present ornithology as an engaging pursuit full of absorbing problems, not as a static discipline with everything settled by pompous dicta of the ex- perts. Original information that cannot be found in other books is emphasized. On almost every page we seek to entice the attention of the amateur ornithologist toward the biological problems that birds so superbly illuminate, in hopes that he will be encouraged to con- tribute to their solution." Certainly no one could quarrel with these aims nor with the sincerity evidenced by the authors in doing exactly as Marshall has written. Virtually every page does indeed reflect our present lack of detailed information on distribution, breeding, or movements of Arizona's birds. More than most other state bird books, this one emphasizes what we don't know. On its positive side it has no equal as a source of information on southwestern birds. Nothing has been taken for granted. Wherever possible, specimens have been re-examined, regardless of their location. Unlike some modern books treating of bird distribution, the species accounts in this volume are based largely on critically examined specimens, not sight records. Many published reports, and even specimens in some cases, are viewed by the authors with a healthy skepticism which some may consider extreme. Throughout the b)ook, dates of occurrence are italicized when supported by specimen evidence; furthermore, a parenthetical insertion reveals location of the specimen (s). References to specimens in the older literature are not taken at face value; everything appears to have been re-examined. Thus the accounts are exceptionally well documented and can be safely relied upon by the most critical reader. The authors' extensive knowledge of living birds is reflected in the numerous worth- while aids and cautions in field identification. Every reporter of sight records in the Southwest should read (and heed) these comments; there is much information here that is not in the field guides. To cite but a few examples: male Allen's and Rufous humming- birds "cannot safely be distinguished in the field" owing to variable back color (p. 64); Clay-colored and Brewer's sparrows may be very difficult to distinguish, but "When in doubt, your bird is a Brewer's!" (p. 197) ; "the White-necked Raven is impossible to identify in life unless seen right beside the Common Raven, when its smaller size can be</page><page sequence="3">486 THE WILSON BULLETIN December 1066 discerned" (p. 106). These may seem rather dogmatic statements in this era of en- lightened field recognition. Nevertheless, I have been uncertain of several male Selasphorus that I have seen clearly; and without exception every questionable "Clay- colored" Sparrow I've taken has proved to be a Brewer's; you know if you see a genuine Clay-colored. Eight years' close association with southwestern Corvus has convinced me that only the uninitiated or careless observer identifies most ravens to species. The White-necked Raven (C. cryptoleucus) is, we all know, a desert or desert-grassland bird, whereas C. corax is more of a mountain species. Phillips states (p. 106), "A raven nest in a yucca or low mesquite would almost certainly be [that of] a White-necked." But the "almost" is important, as disclosed by our recent discovery of breeding Common Ravens in the mesquite-yucca-grassland near Silver City where it has been assumed that the only breeding ravens had to be cryptoleucus. I can likewise endorse the statement (p. 78) that "Many observers do not realize how much a Say's Phoebe resembles a kingbird . . . nor do they appreciate how similar to each other the various species of kingbirds appear." I cite these instances to emphasize my complete agreement with the authors, lest some readers be inclined to dismiss their words of caution. One must witness repeated misidentifications of sonie of these birds before becoming fully impressed by the magnitude of the potential error inherent in the masses of sight records publishe(d annually. Marshall writes in his introduction that the book "is Phillips' Birds of Arizona 'as told to' Marshall and Monson." Phillips "is responsible for the scientific names and classifica- tion used." There are numerous deviations from the conventional A.O.U. Check-list nomenclature. Phainopepla is placed in the Bombycillidae; Peucedramus in the Sylviidae. Surprisingly, the latter and the Turdidae are retained as families, not as subfamilies of the Muscicapidae. Notable is the dismissal of numerous familiar genera such as Chen, Lophodytes, Lophortyx, Squatarola, Columbigallina, Platypsaris, Iridoprocne, Petrochelidon, Ixoreus, Hylocichla, Vermivora (here = Helminthophila), Richrnondena, Pyrrhuloxiui, Guiraca, Hesperiphona, Chlorura, Passerculus, Amphispiza, and Rhynchophanes. However, Passerella is maintained as distinct from Melospiza, and Setophaga is not merged with Myioborus as some have proposed. Anas crecca is considered only "possibly conspecific" with A. carolinensis. The Snow and Blue geese are united under Anser caerulescens. The Mexican Duck (Anas diazi) is treated as a race of the Mallard. Harlan's Hawk is reunited with the Red- tails. The Arizona Woodpecker is merged with Dendrocopos stricklandi of Mexico. The Black-eared Bushtit (Psaltriparus melanotis) is considered to be a form of the polymorphic P. minimus, with the proportion of black-eared birds increasing southward. Troglodytes brunneicollis and T. aedon are likewise considered clinal variations of a single species. Sitta pygmaea is lumped with S. pusilla. Phillips recognizes only one species of Colaptes, combining under C. auratus the Yellow- shafted, Red-shafted, and Gilded flickers (which he advocated at least as early as 1947, cf. Condor, 49:121) since "the differently colored forms of Flickers interbreed mas- sivel) wherever they possibly can." One of the more surprising (and to me the least defensible) lumpings is of the Nash- ville, Virginia's, and Colima warblers (under the name Helminthophila ruficapilla, the "Gray-headed Warbler"). Even if justification could be found for merging the first two, it is stretching a concept too far to place the very different crissalis with them in the absence of reasonable proof. Because three forms are allopatric, have similar songs and call-notes, and nest on the ground is no reason for considering them conspecific. Granted that these three birds are more similar to one another than any is to luciae,</page><page sequence="4">December 19664 ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 487 Vol. 78. No.4 peregrina, or celata, they are distinctive forms and no valid reasons for lumping them are presented in this work. I disagree that crissalis, virginiae, and rujicapilla "all have the same song"; this is not so. Their call-notes are similar, but this seems a minor point. That all three nest on the ground, whereas Lucy's Warbler nests in cavities, is insufficient evidence of conspecificity. Closely related forms may or may not have similar nesting sites (consider the variation within Dendroica, for example). Tail-wagging is cited as still another specific character common to all three forms. Although both Colima and Virginia's warblers indulge in this (as do various other parulids), I do not recall the Nashville Warbler as a "tail-wagger" either as a migrant or on its breeding grounds. Expectedly, the Baltimore and Bullock's orioles are considered conspecific, as are the Rose-breasted and Black-headed grosbeaks and the Indigo and Lazuli buntings. Vernacu- lars assigned to these combinations are "Northern Oriole," "Common Grosbeak," and "Common Bunting." However, the familiar common names are also supplied in the ac- count headings, and are used frequently throughout the bunting account. No new evidence to support the conspecificity of any of these forms is presented here. The rosy finches are also merged under the name Leucosticte tephrocotis, "Rosy Finch." The genus Junco is considered to include, in the United States, but two species, the Brown-eyed Junco (J. hyemalis) and the Yellow-eyed Junco (J. phaeonotus). Although there is considerable merit in this arrangement, I think it is an oversimplification of the complex relationships within this genus. Granting that hyemalis, mearnsi, and the various races of oreganus may be conspecific, it is difficult to include aikeni, the White-winged Junco, in this collective "species" without considerably more evidence than is known to me. Very few mearnsi-aikeni hybrids are known, and I am aware of no intermediates between aikeni and any Junco other than mearnsi. Although the breeding ranges of those two forms overlap, with a few hybrids resulting, Miller ("Speciation in the Avian Genus Junco," 1941: 353) considered it "remarkable that more hybridization does not occur. . . . Through some factors of habitat preference and specific intolerance, or both, they remain essentially separate, as do species rather than races." This very limited interbreeding makes one question the statement (p. 203) that the brown-eyed juncos, like flickers, indulge in "interbreeding on a large scale wherever and whenever possible." Certainly this is an exaggeration. It is misleading, too, to refer to aikeni as "a sort of dull relative of mearnsi" (p. 204), for phenotypically aikeni is conspicuously nearer to the hyem.alis group than to any of the mearnsi-oreganits complex. Interpretation of species limits in Junco is made no easier by the hybridization between oreganus and the forms of caniceps, but in this reviewer's opinion wholesale lumping is not necessarily the answer. Reflecting all subgeneric relationships on a racial level may obscure, rather than clarify. the picture. Some readers will lose patience with the emphasis on taxonomic and nomenclatural matters in this book. (Thirty lines are devoted to the merits of the name Toxostoma crissale as opposed to T. dorsale.) The average reader of a state bird book probably couldn't care less about such matters, but certainly in this way much interesting history is injected into some of the species accounts. As has already been implied, subspecies receive much emphasis-partly because so many forms usually considered full species are reduced to racial status here. Thankfully. there is likely to he little confusion to the lay reader, for the authors list each ".sub- species" separately under the species, with its assigned trinomial and the commonly used vernacular-e.g., "J. h. caniceps (Woodhouse). 'Gray-headed Junco.'" followed by a brief description.</page><page sequence="5">488 THE WILSON BULLETIN )eCellberT 1966 There seem to be very few actual errors in the book; it obviously has been proofread with great care. For all its accuracy and insistence on reliable data, the style of the writing is informal. often chatty, with occasional lapses into slang. I have already commented on the in- clusion of occasional exaggerations. In a scientific work it seems out of place, as well as inaccurate, to be told that young female cowbirds have been stimulated to incubate "by shooting them full of progesterone" and, further, that adult cowbirds "stoutly refuse" to respond (p. 173). (And we tell our students to avoid anthropomorphic interpreta- tions!) It is surprising to encounter in a paragraph on Setophaga-Myioborus relation- ships the statement "It is ruticilla, with its Dendroica-like song, eggs, and tree nesting, which is the odd-ball." Surely there are better ways to word things. Statements such as these detract greatly from the dignity, sincerity, and accuracy one has the right to expect in such a work. Perhaps such writing merely is evidence that languages, like birds, undergo evolution. Certainly the book as a whole is refreshingly readable for a state bird book. No one can complain that The Birds of Arizona is dull reading; this in part compensates for one's annoyance with the occasional "far-out" statement. The 12 color plates, full-page reproductions of Arizona field sketches by George Miksch Sutton, are superbly reproduced and reflect Sutton at his best. I suspect that not a few copies of the book may be purchased for the plates alone. The 51 color photographs by Eliot Porter are good, though not absolutely first-rate owing largely to inferior repro- duction. Most of those in my copy are very dark and dull; a few are too light (as so often is the case with reproductions of flash pictures), with the birds appearing over- exposed. A few (e.g., male Phainopepla, Violet-green Swallow) are not good photo- graphically. The birds in the two Bell's Vireo pictures would almost appear to be of two different species. Some (e.g., Lazuli Bunting, Western Tanager) are lovely, and un- doubtedly most of the originals are of high quality. Throughout the hook one finds evidence of the authors' concern for conservation of birds and bird habitats in Arizona. For example, they express wonder (p. 25) that the Osprey still survives in the State, "considering that even fish-and-game rangers are in- structed to shoot them on sight." (As they do in New Mexico-though officials hesitate to admit it.) Ecological changes are mentioned wherever possible. The plea (p. 42) for preservation of the much-maligned mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) as a valuable and neees- sary component of the riverbottom community should be read by everyone who tills these lands or who hunts White-winged Doves. Long overdue is the declaration that "Grass- lands and riparian woods lave always been neglected by the conservation movement, which concentrates on preserving mountain forests" (p. 194). This reviewer has main- tained for some time that unless ornithologists become truly active in conservation activi- ties future generations will have few natural communities to study in parts of our country. It is reassuring, therefore, to have an authoritative bird book, yet one with a conscience, available to southwesterners. Let us hope that influential Arizonans will not overlook the words of Phillips and Monson at the end of their habitat discussion (p. xvii): "If the state is to remain an attraction to naturalists it is well-nigh past time that action be taken to preserve some of its natural beauties. Let us hope that the data presented in this book do not represent the obituary of some of our most interesting birds. Rather may these birds continue to find shelter and safety in a green Arizona!" In addition to its other assets, this is a handsome, well-made volume.
