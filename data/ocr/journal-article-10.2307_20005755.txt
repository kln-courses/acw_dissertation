If the believer admits that he cannot provide such a description then, Flew would argue, he is admitting that at least his putative theistic assertion is compatible with every state of affairs; consequently it is factually meaningless. The reason for this is that every factually significant assertion must deny that some describable state of affairs obtains. To illustrate, just as when we draw a circle we simultaneously draw in and draw out two particular areas, so when we state a fact we simultaneously deny a fact(s).2 Here is the difficulty, Flew would say, in which the sophisticated believer puts himself when he uses putative theistic assertions: factually he denies nothing, hence factually he asserts nothing. In defence of theism the responses to Flew's challenge have been numerous and varied, and they span a broad spectrum of viewpoints. At one end of the spectrum are those who argue that the challenge itself is misconceived or in some way defective; as such it is said to be completely unsuccessful as a refutation of theism. Arguing that the challenge itself is objectionable, such respondents see no point in trying to meet it. They attempt to disqualify the challenge.3 At the opposite end are those who concede that the challenge is completely successful on its own terms, at least as far as its criticism of the ' Antony Flew, 'Theology and Falsification', in New Essays in Philosophical Theology, ed. Antony Flew and Alasdair Maclntyre (London: SCM Press, I955), p. 99. To understand the circumstances in which the challenge was first issued see Antony Flew, "' Theology and Falsification " in Retrospect', in The Logic of God, ed. Malcolrn Diamond and Thomas V. Litzenburg, Jr (Indianapolis: The Bobbs-Merrill Co., I975), pp. 269 ff. 2 The importance of the element of denial in successful fact-stating is recognized not only by Flew in his briefsymposium paper ('Theology and Falsification', New Essays, pp. 96-9), but also by I. M. Crombie in his response to Flew's paper ('Theology and Falsification', New Essays, pp. IO9, i io). 3 E.g. Alvin Plantinga, God and Other Minds (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, I967), pp. I56-68; George Mavrodes, 'God and Verification', Canadian journal of Theologv, x, 3 (I964), I87-91.</page><page sequence="2">324 GARY COLWELL supposedly factual character of putative theistic assertions is concerned. Still wanting to defend theistic belief, however, such respondents attempt to provide an intelligible account of religious language which does not imply that putative theistic assertions should be understood as literal truth-claims or as possessing the same empirical features as ordinary factual assertions. They attempt to avoid the challenge.' Between these extreme positions there are those who deny both that the challenge is defective and that it cannot be met successfully on its own terms. Accepting the intelligibility and legitimacy of the challenge, such respondents argue that it can be met successfully on its own terms. They attempt to meet the challenge.2 In this charge of meaninglessness against putative theistic assertions Flew has found a close philosophic ally in the person of Kai Nielson who has defen ded, amplified and carried forth the challenge in his articles and books. The general conclusion of Nielsen's book Contemporary Critiques of Religion3 may be stated as follows: although there have been many attempts to deal with Flew's challenge, none has so far been successful. In other words, according to Nielsen, the challenge has not been successfully disqualified, avoided or met by any of the various important responses made to it. The twofold purpose of this paper can now be stated. It concerns specifically the methodology of Nielsen's argument in his Critiques. First, I shall attempt to expose the form of the argument in the Critiques. I shall try to show that in amplifying Flew's challenge Nielsen has changed the relatively simple and open-ended question, first posed by Flew, into a complex question which contains several important assumptions. Second, after attempting to make conspicuous the form of Nielsen's amplified version of Flew's challenge, I shall then proffer a critique of what I consider to be several very questionable assumptions contained within his version. It is hoped that this exposition and methodological criticism will serve as a corrective to the sort of discussion which has been going on in connection with the contemporary empiricist challenge to theism, which discussion seems to have perpetuated some serious misconceptions about believers and the substance of religious belief. NIELSEN S AMPLIFICATION OF FLEW S CHALLENGE In his amplification and defence of Flew's challenge Nielsen takes considerable care to inform his audience not only about what his position includes, but also about what it does not include. Although Nielsen stands squarely within E.g. Ian T. Ramsey, Religious Language (London: SCM Press, I957); R. M. Hare, 'Theology and Falsification', New Essays, pp. 99-103. 2 E.g.John Hick, Faith and Knowledge (2nd edn Ithaca: Cornell University Press, I966); Basil Mitchell, 'Theology and Falsification', New Essays, pp. I03-5. a Kai Nielsen, Contemporary Critiques of Religion (London: Macmillan, I97I); hereafter referred to as Critiques.</page><page sequence="3">THE FLEW-NIELSEN CHALLENGE 325 the empiricist tradition he states that he is not primarily interested in the critiques of religion made by classical empiricists like Hume and Mill. His primary concern is with contemporary empiricism and its critiques of religion. Contemporary empiricists, far more than their predecessors, have been self-consciously concerned with questions of meaning and language - with articulating criteria for what can be significantly asserted or denied and with fixing the bounds of what can be rightly taken to be a truth-claim.1 It is important to realize in this connection that Nielsen does not think that religious discourse is 'flatly meaningless'. He readily admits that 'religious-talk' has at least formal, pictorial and emotional significance.2 What he denies is that such talk has factual significance or makes truth-claims. In addition, Nielsen does not want his position to be identified with logical positivism. As he says himself, 'Logical empiricism or logical positivism, as it is sometimes called, is stone dead. ' There are several weaknesses in positivism which he recognizes, the best-known of which is the thesis of conclusive verifiability or falsifiability. He affirms what others have observed before him: since universal assertions cannot be conclusively verified and existential assertions cannot be conclusively falsified, and since both types of assertions are obviously meaningful, the criterion of conclusive verifiability or falsifiability should not be used to determine whether or not a putatively factual assertion is a genuine truth-claim. This disclaimer notwithstanding, Nielsen does believe that an important residue of logical empiricism remains for the believer to reckon with, even after the unrealistic requirements for meaningfulness have been exposed. For whatever it is that we are allegedly asserting if we are making a genuine factual assertion, it must be possible to show what it would be like for the assertion to be true or probably true and what it would be like for the assertion to be false or probably false. If that condition does not obtain, if God-talk does not lay itself open to experiential confirmation or disconfirmation in this way (not conclusive verification or falsification), it, no matter how emotively meaningful, is without factual signlficance and makes no genuine truth-claim. This much in the empiricist critique seems at least to survive the dissolution of logical empiricism.4 According to Nielsen, no matter what kinds of significance a theistic assertion may be said to have, and he concedes there are several, it cannot be said to have factual significance, to make a truth-claim, unless the fact-stating criterion is satisfied. But that criterion does not entail the unreasonable requirements of conclusive verification and conclusive falsific ation. Rather, it entails the possibility of showing what would make the theistic assertion 'probably true' and 'probably false', or alternatively, what would experientially 'confirm' or 'disconfirm' the assertion.

PP, 39 40.</page><page sequence="4">326 GARY COLWELL There are several other locutions which Nielsen uses more frequently than those above to explain his criterion of fact-stating. In many places throughout the Critiques he uses 'infirmable' for 'disconfirmable', the former being used to mean essentially the same as the latter.' One can see that he prefers 'confirmable or infirmable' to 'confirmable or disconfirmable'. For instance, in one place where he discusses the status of the criterion of factual meaning he puts it this way, "'A sentence is used to make a factual statement only if the statement it makes is at least in principle confirmable or infirmable. "'2 And although Nielsen will accept 'verifiable or falsifiable', in the weak sense of those terms, he nevertheless prefers 'confirmable or infirmable' to those as well.3 The list is not yet complete, for there are at least two other ways in which Nielsen expresses his understanding of the fact-stating criterion. Very often he will use the Wittgensteinian locution, 'what is the case if it is true' or a slight variation on this.4 In a section where he is explaining and defending Ayer's position, Nielsen says, in referring to theological claims, 'And knowing what would be the case if they were true or probably true involves knowing what observations would confirm or infirm them.'5 And finally, he will frequently say that a statement's factual character consists in the possibility of specifying in principle some empirically discernible conditions which will 'count for', and some which will 'count against', the truth of the statement.6 It will be useful for us to see at a glance the number of alternative ways in which Nielsen explains his criterion of fact-stating. Consider then the following compendious statement. For Nielsen a theistic assertion can be used to make a factual statement, to make a truth-claim, only if, at least in principle, (a) it is possible to show what it would be like for the assertion to be 'true' or 'probably true' and what it would be like for the assertion to be 'false' or 'probably false', or (b) it 'lays itself open to experiential confirmation or disconfirmation' or (c) it is 'confirmable or infirmable' or (d) it is possible to specify 'what is the case if it is true' or (e) it is possible to specify some empirical conditions which 'count for' and some which 'count against' the truth of the assertion or (f) it is 'verifiable or falsifiable'. We may observe that although Nielsen emphasizes positive proof a bit more than Flew does, the result of applying the criterion of fact-stating to theistic utterances is the same under Nielsen's amplified version as it is under Flew's unamplified version. And in either case the root cause of the theist's trouble lies with the word 'God'. Theistic assertions are unable to be 'confirmed or infirmed', etc. because 'God', the key word in such assertions, fails to make reference. Nielsen points out that the word 'God' as used by I Ibid.

But, says Nielsen, 'we seem to have no way of identifying the referent of " God ". '1 This, he assumes, is because God, 'whatever it is,... is not something literally observable ... or something we could become directly aware Of. '2 'The referent of "God" cannot be something given in experience.'3 Why he assumes this about 'God' we shall soon see. As far as the purpose of this paper is concerned the most important qualifications concern the type of theist whom Nielsen imagines himself to be addressing, together with the theological doctrines against which Flew's challenge is seen to be a devastating critique. Nielsen's work is confessedly not a comprehensive criticism of all the theological doctrines of Christianity. Early on he says that he will limit himself 'to the fundamental religious conceptions of the Jewish-Christian Islamic forms of life'.' And towards the end of the Critiques he reminds his reader that his defence of the empiricist critique of religion has been 'designed to establish that the central doctrines ofJudaism, Christianity and Islam ... do not succeed in making intelligible truth-claims'.5 The reader is not given an explicit account of which 'conceptions' and 'doctrines' of Christianity (for example) are, in Nielsen's judgement, the 'fundamental' and 'central' ones: still less, the basis for his judgement on these matters. The reader must try to gather from the context of the Critiques, through ideational association, what Nielsen means by these phrases. What mainly he has in mind is suggested when we consider another qualification. It is equally important to recognize that Nielsen follows Flew in directing the modern empiricist challenge to the contemporary' sophisticated believer ' .6 If the reader should ask who precisely are these believers, and what criteria are being used in classifying them as 'sophisticated', once again, he will get no answer from the Critiques. Instead, he will learn from various passages something about what, in Nielsen's opinion, a sophisticated believer believes. In many places Nielsen says or implies that the sophisticated believer is one who thinks of God as being non-anthropomorphic or utterly transcendent in nature.7 And of course the main object of Nielsen's book is to show that when such believers talk about God, assumedly in transcendent or non anthropomorphic terms, their speech is factually meaningless. As Nielsen says, in speaking about the relation between mystical experience and the supposed nature of the transcendent God of Christianity, '. . .if something can be literally experienced as located in space-time, it cannot - logically Ibid. p. 38. 2 Ibid. p. 38. Ibid. p. 38. It should be emphasized here that Nielsen does not stipulate that the referent for 'God' must be something like a rock or a tree, in order to satisfy him; it could be an ethereal phenomenon, something like a pain or an anxiety. Briefly, he would apparently be satisfied if it were 'something given in experience'. We shall therefore understand his request for such a referent in very broad experiential terms. 4 Ibid. p. 2. 5 Ibid. p. 94. 6 Ibid. He uses the similar phrases on pp. I, 2, 3, 4, I9, 25, 29, 6i. Ibid. pp. 2, 3, 4, I9, 20, 28. 12 RES 17</page><page sequence="6">328 GARY COLWELL cannot - be God, i.e., an infinite, utterly transcendent, non-spatio-temporal reality '.1 It is important to bear in mind that these are Nielsen's qualifications. It is he who qualifies 'transcendent' with 'utterly'; and it is he who equates the notions of 'utterly transcendent' and 'non-anthropomorphic'. (Ap parently then, anything less than an utterly transcendent God could not, in his mind, be non-anthropomorphic.) Any theist who would not believe in an utterly transcendent God would also not, in Nielsen's scheme, be a 'sophisticated' theist. He would in fact be an 'unsophisticated' theist. Moreover, such an 'unsophisticated' theist would not, according to Nielsen, believe in the most fundamental doctrine(s) of Christianity. Not having been given precise and unusual definitions of the terms 'sophisticated', 'anthropomorphic', 'transcendent', 'fundamental doc trines', the reader is left to judge for himself whether in accordance with the traditional theological understanding of these terms, as well as the dictionary definitions of them, Nielsen has made justifiable assumptions in his amplifi cation of Flew's challenge. Is it true, for example, that all sophisticated believers hold that a (the) fundamental doctrine of Christianity is the statement that God is utterly transcendent? This and other questions will be addressed in the next part of the paper where we shall examine in detail Nielsen's terms and assumptions. At this stage it is sufficient that we become as clear as we can in our thinking about the multifaceted character of the Flew-Nielsen challenge. The problems raised by Nielsen's qualifications of Flew are numerous, important, complex, and in the author's opinion, the potential source of much confusion concerning what Christianity is and traditionally has been. Let us now attempt to frame Nielsen's amplified version of Flew's challenge in the form of a question which will show the similarity and difference between Flew and Nielsen. Although the resultant question is somewhat awkward, it does, I hope, have the virtue of letting us see at a glance just what Flew's challenge becomes in the hands of Nielsen. What would have to occur or to have occurred to constitute for you [a sophisticated Christian who, because he is sophisticated, believes what is the fundamental doctrine of Christianity, namely that God is utterly transcendent and utterly non anthropomorphic] a disproof of [a confirmation/disconfirmation of, a counting for/against, etc.] the love of, or of the existence of God [a putatively factual assertion like 'God exists' or 'God loves mankind']? The unbracketed portion of the question is simply Flew's challenge verbatim. The bracketed portion is Nielsen's amplification of Flew's challenge. The question taken as a whole may be dubbed the Flew-Nielsen Challenge (hereafter FNC). If the first bracketed qualification is substituted for the word 'you' which immediately precedes it, and if the second bracketed qualification 1 Ibid. p. 24.</page><page sequence="7">THE FLEW-NIELSEN CHALLENGE 329 is substituted for the unbracketed phrase immediately preceding it, and if the final bracketed qualification is substituted for the unbracketed phrases immediately preceding it, then the resultant version, I trust, will form an intelligible if not yet entirely clear question. One of the first impressions that one gets from examining the FNC is that it is no longer the relatively simple and open-ended question that it was when first posed by Flew. In the writing of Nielsen Flew's challenge has become a complex question, the answer to which can be given only if one accepts the assumptions contained within the brackets. Now there may well be opportunity for argument concerning the qualifications within the last two sets of brackets. For example, it may be argued that Nielsen has loosened the requirements of Flew's challenge in the second set of brackets by substituting 'counting for/against', etc. for 'disproof'. Here also someone might want to query the alleged synonymy between the disjuncts (a)-(f) discussed in the compendious statement above. In this paper, however, I shall be content to go along with Nielsen in accepting all these alternatives as roughly equivalent in meaning. That is, I shall assume on the part of the reader a rough understanding that all of Nielsen's alternative ways of expressing his criterion of fact-stating mean at least the presence of elements of experience. Our main concern here is with the qualifications inside the first set of brackets. Let us therefore turn our attention to the assumptions and ideational associations contained therein. METHODOLOGICAL WEAKNESSES IN THE FNC Several times Nielsen says that he is interested only in the fundamentals of the religious views which he is criticizing. 'In discussing critiques of religion I shall limit myself to the fundamental religious conceptions of the Jewish Christian-Islamic forms of life.'1 The believer's analytic reflexes ought to cause him to flinch a bit when he sees a hyphenated compound like 'Jewish-Christian-Islamic forms of life', used in connection with 'funda mental religious conceptions'. This is because it must reasonably be assumed that the fundamental conceptions of God in Judaism, Christianity and Islam are classified anmong 'the [most] fundamental religious conceptions' of these religions. But when we realize that, we are not at all certain that common denominators can be found for the fundamental conceptions of God in each of these religions. - For the Christian, God is thought to be a Trinity of persons. I shall not attempt to speculate about what the remainder would be like if one were to attempt to remove the idea of the second person of the Trinity from the Christian conception of God. One thing is certain, however, that without the idea of the person of Jesus Christ there is no Christian conception of God, 1 Ibid. p. 2. 12-2</page><page sequence="8">330 GARY COLWELL which conception is probably the most fundamental religious conception of Christianity. As commonplace as this may souindl to some people, it nevertheless seems to require restating for the benefit of contemporary religious language debate. And here I am not minimizing the importance of the Father; in fact both persons, together with the Holy Spirit, are considered to be integral to the Christian conception of God. Therefore, it is difficult for this writer to see how the Christian conception of God, a conception which entails the idea of Christ's deity, could be incorporated into the fundamental teachings of Judaism and Islam, both of which deny the trinitarian conception of God. Now of course at a high level of abstraction there can be said to be many religious conceptions held in common by these three religions. All of the religions previously mentioned claim that they are monotheistic; that they are ethical and historical in character; that their God is the supreme being; etc. Unfortunately, however, such rarefied notions as 'supreme being', by themselves, unspecified, tell us next to nothing about the fundamental religious claims of these religions. To say that these religions have funda mentally the same theistic doctrines because they share in common a number of generic qualities would be rather like saying that a chair and a lamp are fundamentally the same kind of object because they share in common the quality of being a piece of furniture. Could it be that we have unfairly interpreted the phrase 'fundamental religious conceptions' in our analysis? We do not think so; for it is clear from another quotation that Nielsen perceives himself as really getting at the heart ofJudaism, Christianity and Islam. Here he speaks of' central doctrines' and 'fundamental theological claims'. In the preceding chapters I have explained and defended an empiricist critique of religion designed to establish that the central doctrines ofJudaism, Christianity and Islam - the most fundamental religious and theological claims which these forms of life presuppose - do not succeed in making truth-claims.' Suppose now it were charged that we have unfairly slanted the meaning of the term 'fundamental' in our favour. To this charge two things could be said in response. First, the dictionary definition of the term will lend us support; second, where the term in question is used together with 'claims', 'doctrines' or 'beliefs', in contexts other than religious, it is evident that our understanding of the term is not peculiar. The adjective 'fundamental' entails not only the idea of that which is 'basic', but also the ideas of that which is 'indispensable' and that which is 'of central importance '.2 All of these ideas come into play at once if we consider 'the fundamental theological claims of the Christian religion.' In other words, we should be looking for those basic claims without which Christianity would not be what it is, and 1 Ibid. p. 94. 2 Webster's Third New International Dictionary (I963), p. 92I.</page><page sequence="9">THE FLEW-NIELSEN CHALLENGE 33I by which, because of their central importance, Christianity is distinguished. If we omit the last two ideas the significance of' Christian' in the phrase 'the fundamental theological claims of the Christian religion' is not guaranteed; in which case there might be nothing particularly Christian about the claims under consideration - surely a self-defeating prospect. I think it safe to say that both Judaism and Islam consider Jesus to be a great teacher and prophet: but only Christianity recognizes him as God incarnate. This latter notion is not only basic to Christianity, it is indispensible to and characteristic of it. To reiterate, without the Christian conception of God, which is fundamental to Christianity, there would not be any Christianity; certainly not any biblical or historic Christianity. In principle the same thing may be said of 'fundamental claims (doctrines, beliefs)' when that phrase is used in other contexts, for example, philosophy and politics. If one were to ask for the 'fundamental claims' of Marxism or of the New Democratic Party, he would surely expect to hear in reply an answer which included not just some basic claims of each, but rather those basic claims without which the ideology or political party in question would not be what it is, and by which it is distinguished. It might well be asked what is particularly wrong with setting the scope of one's thesis? Surely Nielsen cannot be expected to examine everything about these religions in one volume. And if by his criticisms he can undermine the foundations which these religious forms of life presuppose then he will have done a great intellectual service to the philosophy of religion. Certainly there is nothing wrong with such a procedure and if one can undermine the main supports of these religions then he is to be commended as a good strategist. The problem is, however, that Nielsen does not seem to see the major supports, much less undermine them. Throughout his work he continually questions the factual significance of assertions like 'God exists' and 'God loves mankind', but he makes little effort to consider the empirical basis for such assertions, either in the factual content of the term 'God' (in his sense of 'factual') or in the factual moorings for the transcendental elements of God-talk. By any reasonable standards the deity of Christ is absolutely fundamental to any religious system which wishes to call itself Christian. And yet this pivotal doctrine of Christianity is never really addressed by Nielsen. In his criticism of Hick he recognizes only partially the esteem in which Jesus has been held since earliest New Testament times, and continues to be held by a host of sophisticated contemporary Christians.' While correctly observing that the theistic element in the phrase 'Son of God' needs just as much explanation as the term 'God' alone, he fails to realize two important points: (a) although the theistic element in 'Son of God' is transcendental, 1 Ibid. p. 77.</page><page sequence="10">332 GARY COLWELL in Christianity it is not utterly so; (b) since the beginning of ChristianityJesus has been thought of not only as the 'Son of God', but also as 'God the Son'. In other words, the word 'God' in Christian usage can appropriately be applied to Jesus. Witness one of the earliest apostolic confessions of the Church, the confession of Thomas. After satisfying himself that the person before him was indeed the risen Jesus, Thomas exclaims in adoration, 'my Lord and my God'.' It is abundantly clear that Christianity's textbook, the Bible, teaches the divinity of Jesus Christ. Unfortunately, space does not permit a detailed substantiation of this claim. However, it is really unnecessary because the claim has already been well substantiated many times in various theological and philosophical works.2 It is sufficient for our purposes to point out that, whether the word 'God' is used as a proper name or whether the word 'God' is used as a definite description of the attributes of a divine person,3 in either case the word properly applies toJesus Christ. That is, according to the Bible, Jesus appropriated to himself the unique divine name (Yahweh, I Am That I Am) which the Father revealed to Moses and by which he came to be known; also, Jesus attributed to himself and exemplified in his person the attributes (e.g., omnipotence) which the Father attributed to himself and by which he came to be known.4 The significance which this observation has for our study is that a referent for 'God' in Christianity is given in experience. The historic Christian position has always been that God reveals himself at various times and places, and that his clearest self-revelation was in Jesus Christ. It is believed that God, although under no obligation, chose to enter the world of his creation to make himself known here to some extent at least. Consequently for such a Christian, the experience of the divine is part of experience. Therefore, the stipulation which Nielsen makes (in his criticism of Hick)5 to the effect that the verifying conditions of a putatively factual theistic assertion must be expressible exclusively in non-theistic terms, begs the question in an important respect. This is because many of the theistic assertions of Christianity are factually significant precisely because they are in principle historically and experientially verifiable. An objection to the line of argument above is not difficult to imagine. It might be objected that in finding a referent for 'God' in each of the three persons of the Trinity we have not succeeded in eliminating meaninglessness from Christian theistic assertions; for now the question is, 'How can it make 1 John. 20: 26-9 (Revised Standard Version, 1946, 1952). (Subsequent quotations are also from the RSV.) 2 See for example John R. W. Stott, Basic Christianity (London: Inter-Varsity Press, I958), part I; Norman Geisler, Christian Apologetics (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Book House, 1976), pp. 329-52. 3 I.e. attributes which, if possessed, warrant a person's being called 'divine' or 'God'. 4 Cf. Exod. 3: I4, John 8: 58; Gen. I7: I, Matt. 28: i8. A detailed treatment of this point can be found in my 'Biblical Theism and the Question of Factual Significance' (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, University of Waterloo, I979), pp. 8o-i 17. 5 Critiques, p. 75.</page><page sequence="11">THE FLEW-NIELSEN CHALLENGE 333 sense to talk about three persons in one Godhead?' To answer this objection a distinction is called for. The problem which arises as a result of apparently not being able to logically reconcile the terms of a statement is not the same as the problem which arises as a result of apparently not being able to give factual significance to these terms. Logically reconciling the terms which refer to the persons of the Trinity, in a philosophical explanation of the Unity of the Trinity, is not the same as establishing the factual significance of those terms or showing how 'God' is factually significant when applied to each of the persons to whom the terms refer. Briefly, the problem of logical irreconcil ability is not the problem of factual vacuity: the latter problem alone concerns us here. Moreover, a solution to the former problem is not a necessary condition for a solution to the latter problem.' One can understand quite well how 'God', as either a proper name or definite description, applies to Jesus Christ, as well as to the other persons of the Trinity, without understanding precisely how or in what sense the three persons form a Unity in Trinity. Although the strategy of striking at what is fundamental in a major religion, in order to topple the utterances which form its superstructure, is commendable, Nielsen never really dislodges the foundations. At least as far as Christianity is concerned - and here I think that Orthodox Judaism must be included - he has not recognized religion's empirical strength. The reason for this is not difficult to find; we are taken to another set of methodological assumptions which he employs at the beginning of his thesis. Starting early in the Critiques and continuing throughout his work Nielsen uses phrases like 'sophisticated contemporary Christian', 'non-Neanderthal Christian', and 'sophisticated theism'.2 He never explicitly defines these phrases, nor gives any justification for applying them in the way he does; he simply assumes an understanding and agreement on the part of his audience. Let us examinejust two of the passages where such phrases as these are used. (i) Where 'God' is taken to stand for a kind of mysterious cosmic superman who orders things one way rather than another, we have some rough idea what it would be like for it to be true or false that there is such a God. However, by now such religious belief has become idolatry. Such a God is (a) not adequate to the demands of religious life, and (b) recognizably mythical. That is, we know that there is no such God. However, such an utterly anthropomorphic Big-Daddy-in-the-Sky is plainly not the God of sophisticated theism; or at least it is not the image of God that asserts itself when such theists are thinking about the concept of God.3 1 Analogously, the physicist who speaks of the dual nature of radiation at the microphysical level is not required to understand how light can be both undulatory and corpuscular in character before he speaks factually about light as a wave or about light as a particle. Indeed the understanding process would appear to be just the reverse. I have dealt with this point a little more expansively in my doctoral dissertation, pp. 42-4, I09, I IO. 2 Ibid. He uses these or similar phrases on pp. I, 2, 3, 4, I9, 25, 29, 6is. 3 Ibid. p. 3.</page><page sequence="12">334 GARY COLWELL (ii) All but the most Neanderthal ofJews and Christians have long ago decisively rejected a concept of God in which God, like Zeus, is thought of as being physically detectable and as having spatiotemporal location.1 It is not exactly clear who 'Big Daddy' refers to in (i), mainly because of phrases like 'mysterious cosmic superman'; for Christianity's God is mysterious, does have cosmic control, and does possess supernatural power and knowledge. This typifies one of the difficulties in Nielsen's methodological approach to theism, namely the ambiguity in his terms of reference. If 'Daddy' refers only to an utterly anthropomorphic deity then decidedly he is not the God of 'sophisticated' theism. That is, if 'Big Daddy' means only a large, visible old man surrounded by clouds, or a dirty old man like Zeus, fond of making an appearance as an animal, or someone similar, then it goes without saying that no recognizable Christian denomination believes in such a crude anthropomorphic deity. However, if 'Daddy' is meant to include the heavenly Father of the Old Testament, who allegedly did speak to his people, as well as do mighty acts in history, then to say 'Daddy' is not the God of 'sophisticated' theism is false. It is both interesting and relevant to notice thatJesus, in praying to the Father, used the Aramaic word Abba, a term of filial intimacy thought not to be proper to use when speaking to God. The word can mean either 'dear Father' or 'Daddy'.2 A key word in Nielsen's attack upon theism is 'anthropomorphic' and its blanket usage by him often suggests that all religions whose theistic conceptions contain anthropomorphic elements are false; furthermore, no such religion has any sophisticated adherents. However, it is far from obvious that all such religions are false, or recognizably mythical, and it is certainly not true that no such religion has sophisticated adherents. In response to this, someone might question whether we are justified in speaking about a conception of God which is to some degree anthropomorphic. Is it not the case that one's notion of deity must be either utterly anthropomorphic or not at all, as Nielsen seems to think? Neither the ordinary dictionary nor the dictionary of theology will support such an all-or-nothing view of the matter.3 Let us consider the term's use where it is most relevant to our study, in the dictionary of theology. D. M. Beegle, a professor of Hebrew and Old Testament, informs us that the term 'anthropomorphism' ... . designates the view which conceives of God as having human form. . ., but in a wider sense the term also includes human attributes and emotions'.4 In his commentary on the meaning of the term he shows that neither the Old Testament nor the New Testament 1 Ibid. p.

Harrison (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Book House, I960), p. 45.</page><page sequence="13">THE FLEW-NIELSEN CHALLENGE 335 has escaped anthropomorphism completely. Using a quotation from a theologian he summarizes his position. "'To say that God is completely different from us is as absurd as to say that He is completely like us."" Most people who call themselves Christians have at least some anthro pomorphic elements in their beliefs, and that is because of their adherence to the teaching of Scripture. There they read accounts of God speaking, acting, and in general revealing himself in a human form or context. Biblical illustrations can easily be multiplied.2 One early Old Testament passage which is particularly interesting in this regard is Genesis I: 26. It is recorded that man was created in the image of God. In Hebrew the idea meant to be conveyed is that there exists a 'similarity', 'correspondence', or 'resem blance' between the original image and its likeness, that is, between the creator God and the created man.3 Now it must be emphasized that there is no suggestion that the resemblance is complete. How close it is we are not told by the text. Nor is there a suggestion that the Father, in having created man, ceases from being transcendent and ultimately mysterious to man. Briefly, the stated similarity is not meant to deny the essential difference between God and man. These qualifications notwithstanding, however, the import of this passage (along with many others) is clear: there is some degree of resemblance between God and man. In turning to the New Testament we can scarcely find better examples of partially anthropomorphic statements than John's. 'The Word became flesh and dwelt among us' ;4 or Paul's, '. . . Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form he humbled himself....'5 Furthermore, the relationships which the biblical God establishes with men are in many instances like inter-human relationships. For example, he speaks to man and is spoken to by him; he loves man and is loved in return.6 Only by characterizing contemporary Christianity as something akin to Tillichian ontology could one factor out all anthropomorphic elements.7 I am not saying that this cannot be done: only-that it is not natural to do so. For it runs counter to what the Bible suggests, what church history suggests, and what the beliefs of vast numbers of Christians today suggest. To factor out such Christians as 'unsophisticated' because of their partially anthropomorphic beliefs would be shameless question-begging.

We cannot be sure, but against such an objection a consideration of passage (ii), along with other passages in the Critiques,' weighs quite heavily. Since Christians have never believed in a God so crudely anthropomorphic as Zeus, and since this is widely known in the West - it must surely be known by Nielsen - then the concept of God which ' all but the most Neanderthal ofJews and Christians have long ago decisively rejected' must presumably be a concept in which an anthropomorphic parallel with Zeus is only partial. This would seem to be borne out by reference to the mutual quality of spatiotemporal detectability. Unfortun ately, all these conceptions of deity are spoken of as being 'utterly anthro pomorphic'. Once again the problem is that Nielsen avoids making any theological distinctions, for he bunches together the conception of Zeus with the Jewish and Christian conceptions of deity, this being a pretty unsophisticated bunch in his scheme. But of course one may reject concepts of deity after the pattern of Zeus and still accept deity understood in the way Yahweh or Christ is understood. Moreover, such acceptance is found among many sophisticated contemporary believers. The question of ruling out anthropomorphic God-talk is very important because, as far as Christianity is concerned, whatever stance a person takes on the matter may easily affect his thinking about transcendence.2 This is not to claim that there is a logical equivalence between 'non anthropomorphic' and 'utterly transcendent', though at times it seems that Nielsen thinks so. It is simply to say that if the possibility of the personal manifestations of God in history are proscribed a priori, then the step to postulating an utterly transcendent God is an easy one to take. Nielsen appears to have taken the step, though he might not consider it to be a logical one. Nielsen's - along with many others'3 -- insistence that God is transcendent in the 'sophisticated' sense of the term makes the reader who has had more than a casual acquaintance with Judaeo-Christian teaching a bit suspicious. In just one of the several places where Nielsen tells us what the Christian's transcendent God is like he says that '... . if something can be literally experienced as located in space-time, it cannot - logically cannot - be God, i.e., an infinite, utterly transcendent, non-spatio-temporal reality.

Critiques, p. 24.</page><page sequence="15">THE FLEW-NIELSEN CHALLENGE 337 that this alone will not do. For the question which leaps to mind is, 'Who says that God cannot be experienced, at least partially, in space-time; which Christians believe that God is utterly transcendent?' Certainly not those millions of Christians who turn out each Sunday for worship and subscribe to the biblical doctrine of God, either by reciting the creeds ex animo or by using the Christian source book directly. And certainly not according to the sophisticated tradition of Christian scholarship: not according to the early Church fathers (e.g. Polycarp, Irenaeus, Origen), nor Augustine, nor Luther and Calvin, nor contemporary orthodox theologians.' Nielsen's method of presenting his case leaves a good deal to be desired, namely, a more dispassionate and analytical approach. Using expressions like 'sophisticated theism', 'sophisticated contemporary Christian', 'non-Neanderthal Christ ian' he sets the stage for just that kind of theism which he considers worthy of attention, the kind which seems most defenceless before the FNC. By itself this does not of course provide sufficient grounds for criticism. The questionable feature of this methodology lies in the fact that he assumes the stage he sets is large enough to accommodate the whole contemporary sophisticated theological scene: when in fact it is very doubtful whether it can accommodate even a major part of it. It will not I think justify Nielsen's methodological approach to theism to argue, as Malcolm Diamond does for example, against the irrelevance of 'fundamentalism'. Diamond puts forward the view that fundamentalism simply cannot qualify as a contender in the contemporary religious language debate. The reason, he tells us, has primarily to do with fundamentalism's belief in miracles. As far as sophisticated contemporary theologians are concerned, they '... . are embarrassed by the miraculous elements of the Bible' ;2 and as far as contemporary sceptical empiricists are concerned, ' ... they regard fundamentalism as so hopelessly outmoded by the develop ment of scientific standards of believability, that they do not even bother to challenge the thrust of its factually meaningful statments'.3 So although the theistic assertions of fundamentalism are factually meaningful, they are dismissed from the outset as not possibly true by theologians and empiricists alike; hence fundamentalism is not even relevant to the contemporary religious language debate. Furthermore, anyone who implies a belief in the possibility of miracles in his account of the factual significance of theistic assertions, as R. S. Heimbeck does for example,4 is ipso facto 'utterly naive' in his theological approach - no matter how sophisticated his handling of the 1 It is not my intention to try to make all these venerable men subscribe to the detail of my theological viewpoint. However, I do wish to argue that with respect to the fundamental doctrine of Christ's deity at least they would all agree with the biblical account to which I am referring here. See, for example, L. Berkhof, The History of Christian Doctrines (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Wm. B. Eerdmans, I949); Reinhold Seeberg, Text-book of the History of Doctrines, trans. by Charles E. Hay (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Book House, I 96 I). 2 Diamond, The Logic of God, p. 43. 3 Ibid. p. 45 4 Raeburne S. Heimbeck, Theology and Meaning (Stanford: Stanford University Press, i969).</page><page sequence="16">338 GARY COLWELL question of meaning in theology may be. This argument has obvious parallels with Nielsen's and it deserves more than one answer in reply. The possibility of miracles and the authenticity of the biblical record of them are both positions which are ably defended in contemporary philosophy and theology.' The very least one should say about them is that they are open questions. Therefore, given the fact that the question of miracles is not a closed question, it will hardly suffice to assume that the fundamentalist's belief in miracles must be false. Diamond, like Nielsen, assumes in the context of one problem in the philosophy of religion, viz. the problem of religious language, the answer to a question which, in the context of another problem in the philosophy of religion, viz. the problem of miracles, continues to be seriously debated. Briefly, in his methodological approach to religious language he falsely assumes that the question of miracles is settled. Also, like Nielsen, he uses the pejorative modifier, e.g. 'utterly naive', to dismiss in a cavalier manner a viable theological belief. This reply would lose some of its force were it not for the fact that (a) numerous sophisticated Christians do believe in miracles and (b) the complete evacuation of miracles from the Bible raises serious doubt whether what remains can really pass as an account of Christian theism. Diamond's remarks evoke an additional response, one that concerns a theological distinction of some importance for the understanding of con temporary Christianity. While it may be true that all fundamentalists believe in miracles, it is certainly not true that all who believe in miracles are fundamentalists. There exists a large body of sophisticated Christians, generally known as evangelicals or (theological) conservatives, who give primacy of place to the teachings of Scripture, including its account of miracles, in formulating their doctrine of God. Many such believers would no doubt repudiate the label 'fundamentalist', together with the charges of cultural rigidity, anti-intellectualism, intolerance, etc. which are conjured up by the mere use of the term. Furthermore, it cannot be charged that these evangelicals or conservatives are numerically insignificant or that they have no tradition of Christian scholarship. Quite the contrary.2 Fortunately, some leading philosophers of religion are cognizant of these facts. In the introduction to one of his books John Hick outlines his own theological position by referring to two prominent groups in contemporary theology.3 He sees himself as standing on a middle ground between conservatives and radicals. He speaks of the former group as '. . . the growing and articulate conservative wing of the churches which today calls itself evangelical. This 1 E.g. Richard Swinburne, The Concept of Miracle (London: Macmillan, 1970); F. F. Bruce, The New Testament Documents (5th edn, rev.; London: Inter-Varsity Press, I960). 2 For a brief but useful discussion of the distinction here being discussed see William E. Hordern, A Layman's Guide to Protestant Theology (rev. edn New York: Macmillan, I962). 3John Hick, Christianity at the Centre (London: SCM Press, I968), pp. 9-I6.</page><page sequence="17">THE FLEW-NIELSEN CHALLENGE 339 conservative response', says Hick, 'has become a major phenomenon.' Though not a conservative himself, he leaves no doubt about his attitude toward many who belong in this group. 'Although very many intelligent and responsible Christians for whom I have the greatest respect see the classic structure and proportions of theology that we have inherited from the time of St. Augus tine as being permanently valid and as of the essence of the Christian faith, I am quite unable to share their view.'l It is well to remember that not all Christians who give first place to the teachings of Scripture when forming their ideas of God can be tarred with the brush of 'fundamentalism', nor accordingly be disqualified from the contemporary religious language debate. There are very many sophisticated Christians who are neither 'fundamentalist' nor theologically 'naive', but who do believe in and argue for the possibility and existence of miracles. Therefore, the modern empiricist challenge cannot pretend to be challenging contemporary sophisticated Christianity without including those believers whose theistic truth-claims imply the existence of miracles - unless of course it wishes to continue begging the entire question of sophistication in theology. REVIEW AND CONCLUSION Before drawing our discussion to a close let us try to bring into sharper focus the chief critical concerns of this paper. The empiricist challenge in the Critiques canjust as well be cast into an argument form as a question form. The complex question earlier referred to as the FNC can, with some minor modifications, be transposed into an argument against contemporary soph isticated Christianity. Dilemma i. Contemporary Christianity is either (a) utterly transcendental and non anthropomorphic Christianity or (b) anthropomorphic Christianity. 2. No intelligent and cultured, i.e., sophisticated, person would consider believing (b). 3. (a) is the only option open to the sophisticated Christian believer (from I, 2). Criterion offactual significance 4. If a theistic statement is factually significant then it must be possible to indicate what will experientially confirm/disconfirm, count for/against, etc. such a statement. 5. It is not possible to indicate what will experientially confirm/disconfirm, count for/against, etc. the putatively factual theistic statements of (a). Conclusion 6. The only option open to the sophisticated Christian believer turns out to be factually meaningless (from 3, 4, 5). 7. Contemporary sophisticated Christianity is irrational (from 6). 1 Ibid. pp. 9, io. Emphases added.</page><page sequence="18">340 GARY COLWELL Our main critical concerns have not lain with premises 4 and 5. We have been content to go along with '4' and to touch upon '5' only as it pertained to our discussion of the supposed utterly transcendent nature of the Christian God. (Of course this does not necessarily mean that we ultimately accept the FNC's criterion of factual significance.) Instead, we have concentrated our critical remarks mainly upon premises 1-3, and our position has been as follows: even if we assume that '4' and '5' are true, because ' i ' or '2' iS false, '3' does not follow; consequently, the conclusion 6 and 7 cannot be drawn. By way of review let us examine more closely premises 1-3. First, we observed that one cannot talk sensibly about the fundamental claims (doctrines, beliefs) of a particular theism without discussing those basic claims about God without which the theism in question would not be what it is and by which it is distinguished. As far as Christianity is concerned this means that one must talk about a God who came out of obscurity and revealed himself at various times and places, his clearest self-revelation being in the person of Jesus Christ. If one wishes to speak sensibly about the God of Christianity, or even about the Christian conception of God, he must surely speak about the triune God who partially revealed himself in space and time. And although one should speak of him as being transcendent, one should not speak of him as being utterly transcendent. This is hardly a new idea; it is taught by Christianity's textbook and reportedly by Christianity's founder; it is taught by Christian tradition and by a host of contemporary Christians, including a large number of sophisticated ones. The burden of proof rests squarely upon the shoulders of those who suppose they can speak in the same breath about Christian theism and an utterly transcendent God. Premise I is somewhat ambiguous; deliberately so. This is because the assumption about anthropomorphism in the Critiques is itself somewhat ambiguous. This disjunction between (a) and (b) can be interpreted in one of two ways, depending upon whether or not 'non-anthropomorphic' in (a) and 'anthropomorphic' in (b) are qualified by 'utterly'. According to one interpretation it is possible to see Christianity divided into two groups which are polar opposites with regards to their positions on the anthropomorphic nature of God. That is, contemporary Christianity can be seen to be divided into (a) utterly non-anthropomorphic Christianity and (b) utterly (or crudely) anthropomorphic Christianity. According to a second interpreta tion, however, we may view the anthropomorphic position in '(b)' not as the polar opposite of that in ' (a) ', but merely as the denial of that in ' (a) '. On this reading contemporary Christianity can be seen to be divided into (a) utterly non-anthropomorphic Christianity and (b) partially anthropom orphic Christianity. In this case, although there are anthropomorphic elements found in the (b)-group's doctrine of God, such a doctrine is not crudely anthropomorphic. Whichever of the two interpretations we settle upon we find serious problems with the methodological assumptions of the FNC.</page><page sequence="19">THE FLEW-NIELSEN CHALLENGE 34I If we decide upon the first interpretation we discover, on a moment's reflection, that the contemporary empiricist has presented us with a false dilemma. Even if we assume that it makes perfectly good sense to talk about an utterly transcendent and utterly non-anthropomorphic Christian deity, there remains the problem of whether, at the other end, it makes sense to speak about a crudely anthropomorphic Christian deity, like Zeus for example; because no recognizable Christian denomination holds such a crudely anthropomorphic view of God. Furthermore, even if we make another concession and grant for the sake of argument that both of these polar opposite extremes are in fact represented by contemporary Christian belief, there is still the critical question of whether these two groups exhaust the possibilities for anthropomorphism in contemporary Christianity. We state categorically that they do not, for there are many sophisticated believers whose biblical approach to God does not fit either of these extreme groups. In short, the first interpretation is a false dilemma. On the other hand, if we decide upon the second interpretation we get a more reasonable and indeed realistic picture of the contemporary Christian scene. But in this case, although premise I may not be false, premise 2 can no longer be considered true. It is simply false that no sophisticated Christian believers hold a partially anthropomorphic doctrine of God. Therefore, 'i' is either false or true; but if it is true then '2' is false. Consequently, because ' I ' or '2' is false '3' will not follow and the argument will not go through: '6' and '7' cannot be concluded. In bringing our discussion to a close it remains for us to ask how those who subscribe to the empiricist's characterization of contemporary Christianity have fallen into such a loose way of talking. Apparently, what has happened is this. Critics like Flew and Nielsen seize upon a few famous figures like Bultmann and Tillich and call their writings sophisticated contemporary Christianity. Now of course theologians of their stripe dismiss out of hand the possibility of miracles and completely reject anthropomorphic God-talk :' hence the association of' sophisticated' with 'non-anthropomorphic', and by implication, 'unsophisticated' with 'anthropomorphic'. However, as we have already suggested, sophisticated contemporary Christianity simply cannot be identified exclusively with the writings of theologians like Tillich and Bultmann. Not all contemporary sophisticated Christians speak Tillichese2 when they speak of God. Put positively, vast numbers of contemporary sophisticated Christians (including theologians, philosophers, scientists) speak biblically about God. Empiricists who hold up ontologists and existentialists like those above, as the only paradigms of sophisticated Christianity, show a certain imperviousness to fundamental Christian doc ' Rudolph Bultmann, Kerygma and Myth, Hans W. Bartsch, ed. Reginald H. Fuller, trans. (New York: Harper &amp; Row, I 96 I), pp. I-I 6; Malcolm Diamond, Contemporary Philosophy and Religious Thought (New York: McGraw-Hill, I974), pp. 322-393. 2 A word used by Malcolm Diamond in his Contemporary Philosophy and Religious Thought, p. 375.</page><page sequence="20">342 GARY COLWELL trine, not to mention a disdain for the kind of Christianity which most believers accept. And here it should be added that in reading the literature on the religious language debate one will find very few of the discussants who appear to recognize the central importance of Christianity's source book in determining what 'God' in Christianity stands for, or what 'God exists' means.' At a time when religious philosophy is experiencing such a resurgence this should only be regarded as a lamentable state of affairs. The way to clear up the methodological misconceptions at the root of the empiricist argument against theism is, I suggest, quite straightforward. It is simply a matter of specificity. If the contemporary empiricist wishes to challenge the factual significance of the theistic assertions of the systematic theology of some contemporary radical theologian, then let him say so specifically. In each case he may or may not be presenting a formidable challenge to theists of that particular persuasion, but by narrowing his scope considerably he will at least be presenting an accurate challenge. However, what is gained in accuracy will be lost in force; for by accurately narrowing his scope the empiricist will no longer be issuing what has been so widely accepted as a challenge to all of contemporary sophisticated Christianity. 1 E.g. a standard anthology on the religious language debate is New Essays in Philosophical Theology by Flew and Maclntyre. With the exception of Crombie's essay no reference, to my knowledge, is made to the fundamental importance of the Bible in the discussion at hand.</page></plain_text>
