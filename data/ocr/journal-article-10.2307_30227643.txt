<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONFUCIUS AT WALDEN POND: THOREAU'S UNPUBLISHED CONFUCIAN TRANSLATIONS Hongbo Tan THE BERG COLLECTION of the New York Public Library possesses an unpublished manuscript notebook by Henry David Thoreau containing, among other writings, Thoreau's translation of ninety-six paragraphs of Confucius from M. J. Pauthier's Confucius et Mencius (Paris, 1841) written on twenty-three pages.' This is an important document, since for decades, scholars have been speculating on possible sources for the Confucian sayings Thoreau used in his writings. In 1961, Lyman V. Cady discovered to his surprise that none of the nine Confucian quotations he found in Walden coincided with any of the English translations of the Confucian works Thoreau had read.2 After a close comparison between these quotations and Pauthier's Confucius et Mencius in Les Livres sacris de l'Orient (Paris, 1840), Cady submitted that Thoreau must have made his own translations from Pauthier, whose text con- trolled "the form and wording of the English equivalent" of the Walden quota- tions, with even the proper names following "the French system of romanization used by Pauthier." Despite his convincing demonstration, Cady admits that "external evidence is very scanty."3 What Cady did not realize is that "external evidence" does exist in the Berg Collection manuscript notebook. In it, Thoreau had translated not only these nine quotations, but many more. This article, besides presenting for the first time Thoreau's complete translation from Pauthier's text, attempts to investigate the history of the manuscript, and the factors that have kept these translations from being acknowledged. It will also explore the possible causes behind Thoreau's decision to make his own transla- tion, the tentative date of his undertaking, as well as discuss the Neo-Confucian Four Books, the texts from which Thoreau selected his translations. 275</page><page sequence="2">276 Studies in the American Renaissance 1993 I The manuscript that contains these translations has an interesting history. As early as 1932, Arthur Christy noted an unpublished Thoreau notebook de- scribed in the Catalogue of the Stephen H. Wakeman Collection of Books of Nineteenth Century American Writers as containing Thoreau's translations of Confucius.4 Sold at the Wakeman sale to a private collector, and apparently not easily accessible, in 1958, it was sold at the Parke-Bernet Galleries to the House of El Dieff for $3,750.6 Six years later, Kenneth Walter Cameron listed this notebook, now in the collection of the New York Public Library, as the only unpublished Thoreau Commonplace book.6 In 1974, William Howarth pre- sented a bibliographical description of the notebook itself in The Literary Manuscripts of Henry David Thoreau,7 and the following year, Joseph J. Moldenhauer, editor of Thoreau's Early Essays and Miscellanies, acknowledged his translations when commenting in a textual note on Thoreau's selections of the Confucian sayings for the Dial.8 Most recently, and on the evidence of the notebook, Robert Sattelmeyer included Pauthier's Confucius et Mencius in his "Bibliographical Catalogue" in Thoreau's Reading (1988).9 But none of these scholars seems to show an understanding of exactly what Thoreau had trans- lated; nor do they seem to feel the need for further investigation. The Princeton edition of Thoreau's Translations, for example, ignores these translated Confu- cian passages, stating that its editorial principle is to publish Thoreau's "literary translations" only.'a Thus, ironically, while critics such as Cady go so far as to infer that Thoreau had made his own translations in Walden, while a single figure of speech in Thoreau's writings often triggers endless source probing and investigation, these twenty-three pages of Thoreau's actual translation remain ignored in the archive, their content virtually unknown. Anxious to defend Thoreau's originality, or, rather his Occidentality, critics since Mark Van Doren, who asserted in 1916 that "Thoreau took figures and sentences, not ideas from his Oriental reading,"" have tended to minimize Thoreau's debt to the Orient, particularly to the Confucian texts. In his pioneer- ing study of the Orient in American Transcendentalism, Christy acknowledges the Confucian canon as one of the three major Oriental resources. But he quickly dismisses it as least significant when compared with the Indian and Persian influences, and declares unhesitantly that it is "fruitless to attempt finding in [Thoreau] a resemblance to the ethics of Confucius." He further asserts that there was "nothing essentially Confucian in Thoreau's tempera- ment," adding "No Confucius would ever have gone to Walden."'2 Few scholars have challenged these conclusions. Even Cady, after his elaborate effort to argue that the nine Confucian quotations in Walden are Thoreau's own transla- tion, finds himself noting apologetically that Thoreau "for the most part uses</page><page sequence="3">Thoreau's Confucian Translations 277 Confucian materials in a non-Confucian way," and that "he rarely sees these sayings in their proper implications."13 As if it were to avoid the pit, some recent scholars turn to the "construction" of Thoreau's Taoism via his reading of Confucianism.'4 When Orientalism in general is regarded as marginal, the Confucian canon marginal within that margin, one cannot be surprised that these translations have been neglected for so long. II To understand what impelled Thoreau to undertake his own translation, we need to examine what the Confucian texts are, and how they came into exist- ence. Most Thoreau scholars view the Confucian tradition as a stagnant ortho- doxy having nothing in common with Thoreau's dynamic and unconventional, if not eccentric, individualism. A closer study of Chinese intellectual history will reveal, on the contrary, that Confucianism is, to quote Daniel K. Gardner, "no more an unchanging monolith than was Christianity."'5 Just as the understand- ing of the Bible varied from a Puritan to a Transcendentalist, the interpretation of the Confucian texts differed between scholars of the Han and Sung dynasties. The texts Thoreau translated are from the Neo-Confucian Four Books, compiled by the great Sung Confucian scholar, Chu Hsi (1130-1200), "the most influential philosopher" since the time of Confucius and Mencius.'6 A collection of four Confucian classics, the Four Books consists of the Ta-hsiieh (the Great Learning), the Lun-yii (the Analects), the Meng-tzu (the Mencius), and the Chung-yung (the Doctrine of Mean). While the Lun-yii and the Meng-tzu were originally two of the Thirteen Confucian Classics, the Ta-hsiieh and the Chung- yung were two chapters from the Li Chi (the Books of Rites, one of the Thirteen as well). In 1190, Chu Hsi grouped the four together and published them for the first time as one collection."7 The significance of this compilation was far- reaching; it altered the entire course of the Confucian classics. For centuries, the central texts in the Confucian tradition had been the Five Classics: the I ching (the Book of Changes), the Shih-ching (the Book of Poetry), the Shu ching (the Book of History), the Li Chi (the Book of Rites) and the Ch'un-ch'iu (the Spring and Autumn Annals). These works were the first of the Thirteen Classics to be canonized and remained central and most important for more than a millennium.'s But Chu Hsi, after over fifty years' devotion to the Confucian classics, was convinced that the Confucian principles were "more accessible" in the Four Books. He therefore urged his students to focus on these works instead. In 1313, the Four Books, together with Chu Hsi's com- mentaries, were made official and became the basis of the Chinese civil service examinations. Until 1905, when the examination system was abolished, the</page><page sequence="4">278 Studies in the American Renaissance 1993 Four Books had been held as the "intellectual standards" for the Chinese literati.19 The rise in importance of the Four Books was closely connected with Sung intellectuals' efforts to revive the Confucian tradition. Like any philosophical or religious tradition, Confucianism has also experienced its ups and downs. Since the reign of Emperor Wu (141-87 B.c.) of the Han dynasty (206 B.c.-220 A.D.), Confucianism had gained a more privileged status than any other Chinese doctrines. From the late Han through the Tang (618-907 A.D.) dynasties, how- ever, Neo-Taoism and Buddhism, the latter in particular, gained a stronger hold on the Chinese population. The political chaos and social upheaval prevailing throughout the country during the late Tang dynasty further enhanced the appeal of these teachings. Restoration of the Confucian tradition became urgent for the Sung dynasty (960-1279 A.D.). To many of the Sung scholars, the Confucian classics were no doubt the "receptacle of the truth."'2 The problem was how to interpret them. They found that scholars since Han had relied too heavily on Han commentar- ies, many of which "obscured" the true message of the original. To unveil the truth, Sung scholars advocated a return to the "bare" text. This going back to the original was not a mere intellectual gesture. It was closely related to the Sung Confucianists' vision of the world order. As Gardner's study shows, with the collapse of the powerful Tang empire still "fresh" in their mind, the Sung Chinese encountered new problems: nomads were occupying the north, and the doctrines of Buddhism, penetrating from India, continued luring away the population. "Be they adults or children, officials, farmers, or merchants, men or women, all have entered the Buddhist fold," lamented Chu Hsi.2' The Sung scholars believed that this was all because the Confucian "Way" had declined. To return to the Golden age, they held, one needed only to bring back the principles of the Classics and let the Way prevail again. Thus Chu Hsi wrote: The sages wrote the classics in order to teach later generations. These texts enable the reader to reflect on the ideas of the sages while reciting their words and hence to understand what is in accordance with the principle of things. Understanding the whole substance of the proper Way, he will practise the Way with all his strength, and so enter the realm of the sages and worthies.22 Not all Thirteen Classics caught his equal attention, however; nor was the Five Classics his preference. He was attracted instead, as has already been men- tioned, to the Four Books: In reading, begin with passages that are easy to understand. For example, principle is brilliantly clear in the Ta-hsiieh, the Chung-yung, the Lun-yii, and the Meng-tzu, these four texts. Men simply do not read them. If these texts were</page><page sequence="5">Thoreau's Confucian Translations 279 understood, any book could be read, any principle could be investigated, any affair could be managed.n It seems that an easy accessibility of Confucian principles made Chu Hsi turn his attention to the Four books. But other factors were even more important. With the impact of Buddhist thought, accompanied by the increasing promi- nence of Neo-Taoism, Sung Confucian scholars could no longer ignore broader ontological and metaphysical issues. They had to ponder not only man's relation to man, but also man's relation to the universe. While the Five Classics were more prescriptive in nature, indicating, for example, how one should conduct oneself in "certain concrete objective situations," how "ritualistic practice" could maintain "a well-ordered society," the Four Books were concerned prima- rily with the "nature of man," the "inner source" of his morality, and his relation to the world.24 Another factor Gardner believes grew logically from the "reaction" of the scholars to the "bleak" political situation of the time, and, particularly, to the failure of Wang An-shih's political and institutional reform. Disillusioned, Sung scholars realized that institutional and legal changes alone could not bring about social and political order. Many then turned their concerns inward to the process of"moral self-perfection." They felt deeply that progress in the "outer" realm depended on "prior" progress in the "inner realm," and believed that only the "truly" good man could bring about good reform; only the "truly" good man could maintain the effectiveness of his reformationY5 Consequently, the prob- lems of human nature and the cultivation of the self became the center of their attention, and the Four Books, with their emphasis on exactly these issues, rose naturally in importance. Their centrality in the Confucian canon was thus established. Understandably, books of this nature would catch the attention of Thoreau, who was equally engaged with these issues. In nineteenth-century New England, social reform-from civil disobedience and the abolition of slavery to communitarian schemes like Brook Farm--was on everybody's mind. III Before proceeding with the description of Thoreau's translations, a brief note to each of the Four Books is necessary. (1) The Ta-hsiieh. The Ta-hsiieh, the first of the Four, was originally Chapter 42 of the Li Chi. Chu Hsi, following Ssu-ma Kuang (1019-86) and the famous Cheng brothers (1032-85, 1033-1107), rearranged the chapter, making it an individual work.26 As its title suggests,27 the Ta-hsiieh presents an "outline for learning," and a "pattern for cultivating the self and governing the other.""2 Chu</page><page sequence="6">280 Studies in the American Renaissance 1993 Hsi compares this text to the "foundation" of a house. A man building a house must start with the foundation; a student reading the Four Books must begin with the Ta-hsiieh. Chan finds that the Ta-hsiieh, despite its small size, has summarized the Confucian "educational, moral and political" programs neatly in its "three items" of "manifesting the clear character of man, loving the people, and abiding in the highest good," and the "eight steps" of "the investigation of things, extension of knowledge, sincerity of the will, rectification of the mind, cultivation of the personal life, regulation of the family, national order, and world peace." In contrast to the Chung-yung, this book is "rational in tone." While the former being a metaphysical discourse, the latter, Chan maintains, is the "Confucian doctrine of humanity (jen) in application."29 Although the Ta- hsiieh does not discuss metaphysical problems, it presents "the investigation of things" as the "starting point" in moral and social life. This, Chan holds, is "perfectly" in accordance with the Confucian emphasis on learning." (2) The Lun-yii. A collection of sayings by Confucius and his pupils, the Lun- yii consists of two parts of ten books each. Four hundred and ninety-two chapters in its original state, Chu Hsi combined and redivided certain chapters, making a total of eight hundred and forty-two, with one of the chapters further divided into eighteen sections.31 Chan considers the material of the text "unsys- tematic," in a few cases, "repetitive," and in some cases "historically inaccurate"; but, the Lun-yii, he insists, is "generally accepted" as "the most authentic and reliable source of Confucian teachings."32 It reflects most explicitly the human- istic emphasis of the Confucian teaching. Like Thoreau in A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, 3 Confucius talks about man and life at present: "Chi-lu (Tzu-lu) asked about serving the spiritual being. Confucius said, 'if we are not yet able to serve man, how can we serve spiritual beings?' He ventured to ask about death, Confucius said, 'if we do not yet know about life, how can we know about death."'' His strong faith in man is reflected in his belief that man "can make the Way [Tao] great," and not that "the Way can make man great."' He offers also specific instructions on how to be a superior man and on what constitutes proper conduct. He teaches further, like Emerson and Thoreau, the perfectibility of all men. Until Confucius' time, the term chiin-tzu, often translated as "superior man," was a term referring to hereditary nobility. Confucius changed this concept and used it to address most of the time a "morally superior man."" The Confucian interpretation of Heaven in the Lun- yii departed from the traditional belief even more radically. According to Chan, the superior power was originally called "Ti" (the Lord) or "Shang-ti" (the Lord on High) and was understood in an "anthropomorphic sense." Confucius never used "Ti," but "T'ien" (Heaven) instead. While it is still "purposive" and is the "master of all things," Chan writes, Confucius' Heaven is no longer the "greatest of all spiritual beings who rules in a personal manner." His is a "Supreme Being" who only "reigns," leaving his "Moral Law" to operate by itself.37</page><page sequence="7">Thoreau's Confucian Translations 281 (3) The Meng-tzu. The Meng-tzu is perhaps the most "unified text" of the four.38 The work is divided into seven books; each in turn divided into two parts. While Confucius talks about specific modes of behavior, Mencius speaks to larger issues, such as preserving the mind, and nourishing the nature. Chan considers Book 6, Part I, "the most important portion" of the text. It records in full Mencius' theory of human nature. While "Confucius no more than implied that human nature is good," Mencius "declared definitely" that human nature is "originally good."39 In Mencius' scheme, as for the Transcendentalists', the universe is "essentially moral." Both man and nature originate from Heaven. The moral principles of man are therefore "the metaphysical principles of the universe," and the nature of man is an "exemplification" of these principles. Based on his conception of the original goodness of human nature, Mencius further develops the theory that all things are complete within: "All things are already complete in oneself. There is no greater joy than to examine oneself and be sincere."40 Built up around his theory of human nature are, as Chan summa- rizes, Mencius' other tenets: Man "possesses the 'innate' knowledge of the good and 'innate ability' to do good"; "if one develops his mind to the utmost, he can serve Heaven,' and 'fulfil his destiny'"; "evil is not inborn but due to man's own failures and his inability to avoid evil external influences"; "serious efforts must be made to recover our original nature"; and "the end of learning is none other than to 'seek for the lost mind.'"'41 (4) The Chung-yung. Of the Four Books the Chung-yung is considered the most difficult since it concerns, to quote Chu Hsi, "subtle mysteries of the ancients"; it speaks often of"the abstract," of"spiritual beings," and of"forming a trinity with heaven and earth."42 Formerly a chapter of the Li Chi, the Chung- yung is, in Chan's opinion, "the most philosophical" of the Four.43 The text begins with Chu Hsi's remark: Master Ch'eng I [Ch'eng I-ch'uan, 1033-1107] said, "By Chung (central) is meant what is not one-sided, and by yung (ordinary) is meant what is unchangeable. Chung is the correct path of the world and yung is the definite principle of the world." This work represents the central way in which the doctrines of the Confucian school have been transmitted. . . . The book "first speaks of one principle, next it spreads out to cover the ten thousand things, and finally returns and gathers them all under the one principle." Unroll it, and it reaches in all directions. Roll it up, and it withdraws and lies hidden in minuteness. The language itself reveals the mystic nature of the text. No wonder this work had "strong appeal" to both Taoist and Buddhist scholars, who had written lengthy commentaries on it long before it was made one of the Confucian Four Books. One Buddhist monk in the eleventh century even styled himself by the title of the book.44 What had attracted Taoists, Buddhists, as well as Sung Confucian scholars, is, Chan believes, the very subject the text explores, "human</page><page sequence="8">282 Studies in the American Renaissance 1993 nature and the Way of Heaven": "What Heaven (T'ien, Nature) imparts to man is called human nature. To follow our nature is called the Way (Tao). Cultivate the Way is called education. The Way cannot be separated from us for a moment. What can be separated from us is not the Way."45 These are the concepts even Emerson had to copy into his "savings bank."46 IV We must note that Thoreau had read at least three English translations of the Neo-Confucian Four Books, from which he made, together with Emerson, two selections, and published them in the Dial in 1843.47 But in his writings he seldom relied on these translations. The reason is perhaps easy to surmise: by his time, western intellectuals had inherited two conflicting views of Confucius. The Jesuits, whose mission reached China in the late sixteenth century, were the first introducers of Confucius into the West. Hoping to win over the mandarin- scholars, hence the Imperial Court, these missionaries carefully studied the Chinese classics, many becoming renowned Chinese scholars and great admir- ers of Confucius. The version of the Chinese sage they presented to the West had so aroused the admiration of such European thinkers as Leibnitz and Voltaire that Confucius became "the patron saint of eighteenth-century Enlight- enment."48 On the other hand, the Protestant missionaries, who came to China in the early nineteenth century, and who ardently set about to convert millions of lost souls, found Confucius a pagan, lacking the light of God. It is altogether characteristic of this age that David Collie, one of the Protestant translators Thoreau encountered, should describe the Confucian system as "compounded of a number of self-evident, sound, practical truths, intermingled with many abstruse, high sounding, false, and highly dangerous theories," while noting that Confucius himself labored "under the destructive influence of the most gross and dangerous ignorance, viz. Ignorance of his Creator."49 Of the three English translations Thoreau read, the first was by Father Couplet, a Jesuit missionary who went to China in 1658 and stayed there till 1680 when he was sent back to Europe,50 and published in 1687 Confucius Sinica Philosophus, "the first translation of Confucius" in Europe.51 The other two were by Joshua Marshman, a Baptist missionary stationed in India,52 and Collie, a member of the London Missionary Society, and later principal of the Protestant Anglo-Chinese College at Malacca.53 Unlike these English translators, Pauthier (1801-73) was not a missionary. He was, according to Raymond Schwab, a "good Indic scholar" but a "better sinologist.""' Pauthier began his literary career as a poet, publishing two collec- tions of poems in the late 1820s. But his verse, as Schwab notes, showed "few</page><page sequence="9">Thoreau's Confucian Translations 283 flashes of genius." It was his Oriental scholarship that put him on a level with Abel R6musat, Stanislas Julien, and other famed Orientalists. His translation of Colebrook's "Essay on the Philosophy of the Hindus" in 1832 won him a prize from the royal college. His Les Livres sacres de l'Orient (Paris, 1840) provided the curious "a portable Asia," and became an "important channel" through which "works exhumed by the philologists were to enter the larger sphere of living values."55 Even Ezra Pound based his poetic rendering of the Confucian Cantos on this book." Like the famous sinologist R6musat, Pauthier, too, devoted much of his life to Chinese studies. His scholarly works include a Chinese-Latin-French dictionary, and translations of various Chinese classics (including the Taoist text), chronologies, and official documents. He also wrote essays and books on China, ranging from its literature, government, and religion to agriculture, medicine, and plants; from general descriptions of the country to accounts of its interactions with Western powers-making a total of over forty publications.57 Pauthier's Confucius et Mencius was first published as part ofLes Livres sacrds in 1840. This part, a complete translation of the Four Books with Chu Hsi's commentaries, was reprinted the following year as a separate book. It was from this that Thoreau made his translations. Contrary to what had then been held to be the Oriental mentality, motionless and immovable, Pauthier begins his introduction to Confucius et Mencius by stating that "En Orient, comme dans la plupart des contrdes du globe, mais en Orient surtout, le sol a 6t6 sillonn6 par de nombreuses rdvolutions, par des bouleversements qui ont chang6 la face des empires."58' What have endured these "bouleversements," Pauthier writes, are those monuments that "exercent la plus puissante influence sur les destinies des nations." These are "les grandes ]huvres de l'intelligence humaine que les sibcles produisent de loin en loin, et qui, m6tdores extraordinaries, apparaissent comme des ,riv6lations i des points d6terminds du temps et de l'espace, pour guider les nations dans les voies providentielles que le genre humain doit parcourir" (p. i). The Chinese text presented here in French is, he states, "un de ces monumens providentiels" (p. i). Pauthier has certainly shown his reverence for the subject. He has been disturbed by the assumption held by many of his contemporary historicans of philosophy in regard to Confucius. In Livres sacris he cites with overt agitation Hegel's view: N'est-il pas pdnible, par exemple, de voir des historiens de la philosophie comme Hegel et H. Ritter, dont les habitudes d'esprit sdrieuses devaient ]btre exemptes, sinon d'une pareille ignorance, au moins d'une pareille l6garet6, crire, le premier: 'Nous avons des entretiens de Confucius avec ses disciples, dans lesquelles est exprimbe une morale populaire; cette morale se trouve partout, chez tous les peuples, et meilleure; elle n'a rien que de vulgaire. Confucius est un philosophe pratique; la philosophie spculative ne se rencontre pas dans ses dcrits; ses doctrines morales ne sont que bonnes, usuelles, mais on n'y peut rien apprendre de sp6cial.59</page><page sequence="10">284 Studies in the American Renaissance 1993 Hegel blindly dismisses Confucius as a mere "practical philosopher." His moral is "good," Hegel writes, but "common," and can be found at "homes of all peoples." Because the "speculative philosophy" is lacking in this teaching, Hegel continues, there is "nothing special" in it. With a tone of Occidental superiority, Hegel writes: "L'ouvrage moral de Cicdron, De Officiis, nous en apprend plus et mieux que tous les ouvrages de Confucius" (quoted on p. ix). Addressing himself directly to Hegel's "l6gardt&amp;," if not "ignorance," Pauthier argues that "cette doctrine, il ne la donnait pas comme nouvelle," but in the "mission d'Institute du genre humain," the Chinese philosopher accomplished bien autrement qu'ancunn philosophe de l'antiquit6 classique. Sa philosophie ne consistait pas en speculations plus ou moinss vaines, mais c'6tait une philosophie surtout pratique, qui s'6tendait i toutes les conditions de la vie, i tous les rapports de l'existence sociale. Le grand but de cette philosophie, le but pour ainsi dire unique, 6tait l'amrlioration constante de soi-me]bme et des autres hommes; de soi- me]bme d'abord, ensuite des autres. L'amdlioration ou le perfectionnement de soi-me]bme est d'une ndcessitd absolue pour arriver i l'amblioration et au perfectionnement des autres." To teach the priority of self-improvement, Pauthier maintains, is what makes Confucius unique and distinctive from other philosophers. Speaking of Mencius, Pauthier holds that he "poss6dait une connaissance profonde du c]hur humain" (p. xxiv), and he finds Mencius' philosophy "plus de viqueur et de sallies spirituaelles" than that of Socrates and Plato (p. xxv). Pauthier also commends the Confucian way of government, stating: "Selon Khoung-tseu, le gouvernement est ce qui estjuste et droit. C'est la r6alisation des lois 6ternelles qui doivent faire le bonheur de l'humanit6, et que les plus hautes intelligences, par une application incessante de tous le instants de leur vie, sont seules capables de connai]btre et d'enseigner aux hommes" (p. xi). Perhaps Thoreau would find him quite in agreement when Pauthier concludes: "Dans un temps ori le sentiment moral semble se corrompre et se perdre, et la socidt6 marcher aveugl6ment dans la voie des seuls instincts materiels, il ne sera peut-e]btre pas inutile de rdp6ter les enseignemens de haute et divine raison que le plus grand philosophe de l'antiquit6 orientale a donn6s au monde" (p. xxviii). V The manuscript that contains Thoreau's Confucian translations is a bound notebook, consisting of "136 leaves of white wove [paper], 23.8 x 19.2 cm., paged '1-269."'61 The catalogue of the Parke-Bernet Galleries 1958 sale de- scribes the notebook thus:</page><page sequence="11">Thoreau's Confucian Translations 285 Thoreau, Henry D. MS Note Book, containing Transcripts and Extracts of Poems By Early English Poets, Translations of Portions of two French Works with his notes on the same, etc. Closely written, in ink, on about 225 pages and consisting of approximately Twenty-Eight thousand and Two Hundred Words. 4to, half roan. ... Entirely in the Autography of Thoreau .... Among the contents may be mentioned: Translations from the French: Portion of "Confucius et Mencius ... Traduit du Chinois. Par M. G. Pauthier." Written on 23 pages. Thoreau has translated many paragraphs, and interspersed are notes by Thoreau on the same.62 Thoreau's translations (including that of the Pauthier's introduction) were cop- ied fairly neatly on pages 127-49. At the head, Thoreau cited the book from which he made his translations: "Confucius et Mencius. Les Quatre Livres De Philosophie Morale Et Politique De La Chine, Traduit Du Chinois Par M. J. Pauthier. Paris, 1841" (p. 127). He then translated two paragraphs from Pauthier's Introduction (pp. 127-28). The third paragraph consists of his notes on Pauthier's other Chinese works, Spring time &amp; Autumn and Chou-king, both of which Pauthier had translated from the Chinese and published in his Livres Sacris, and Descriptins historique, geographique et litteraire de la Chine (p. 128). His translation of the Confucian passages begins on page 129 and continues to page 149. Thoreau has translated a total of ninety-six paragraphs of Confucius from Pauthier,63 of which five are from the Ta-hsiieh, thirteen from the Chung-yung, forty-six from the Lun-yii, and thirty-two from the Meng-tzu. On the whole, Thoreau follows the order of the French text in selecting his translations. In a few cases, however, he goes back to a previous chapter and translates one or two more items before resuming the regular order. All the translations are written in ink, but interspersed are his additions, corrections, and commentaries, mostly in pencil. A helpful clue in the manuscript is that forty-one of these passages are struck through with a light vertical line in pencil. I have succeeded in locating Thoreau's use of twenty-seven of these marked passages: fifteen in Walden (one in F. B. Sanborn's Bibliophile edition), six in A Week, two in "Civil Disobedience," one in "Walking," and three in the Letters- plus nine paragraphs in a single long passage in an unpublished manuscript at the Houghton Library, Harvard University." It seems obvious that Thoreau had also intended these translations for his literary writings-like Emerson's "sav- ings bank," from which he could readily withdraw ideas or quotations. Nowhere in his journals or other writings did Thoreau specify the date of these translation although he alluded to them once. On 12 December 1856, Thoreau responded to B. B. Wiley's inquires about Confucius. After explaining what he understood as the essence of the Confucian teaching, Thoreau included three sayings, stating that these were passages he "translated from the French."' However, he did not give any indication of when he had done it.</page><page sequence="12">286 Studies in the American Renaissance 1993 There is no known record of Thoreau's borrowing of the Pauthier book, nor did Thoreau date the "Commonplace book." The catalogues of the Wakeman and the Parke-Bernet sales both describe the "Commonplace Book" as "in all probability" written in Thoreau's "Later Thirties or Early Forties," which would place it in the mid and late 1850s. Based on its contents, Cameron also agrees on 1850-55.66 Howarth gives the notebook two dates: 1842-43 and 1850, while Moldenhauer assumes a time period from the late 1830s to the early 1840s.67 We need to reach a more satisfactory date than somewhere between the late 1830s and 1850s. Pauthier's book was published in 1841, which establishes the earliest year in which Thoreau could have done the translation. The Confucian translations follow closely Thoreau's transcriptions of early English poets in the notebook. According to Sattelmeyer, from the second half of 1841 to the end of 1843 Thoreau read and copied "extensively" English poetry and verse dramas." It is very likely that these transcriptions of early English poets were done during this period, and it might even be probable that some of them were copied from the books Thoreau read in New York in late 1843 when he was tutoring William Emerson's children.69 Howarth's dating of 1842-43 undoubtedly refers to the copied English poetry. This then leaves us two possible times for the transla- tions: one could be within the period of Thoreau's transcriptions of the English poets, as the translations follow closely after them; the other would be any time after that, but certainly before 1850. In "Resistance to Civil Government," Thoreau first made use of one of his translations: "If a state is governed by the principles of reason, poverty and misery are a subject of shame; if a state is not governed by the principles of reason, riches and honors are then the subjects of shame."'7 "Resistance" first reached print on 14 May 1849 as Article X of Elizabeth Palmer Peabody's Aesthetic Papers, after it was earlier delivered as a lecture before the Concord Lyceum on 26 January 1848.7' But Thoreau is known to have been in the habit of constantly revising his manuscripts until the last minute. Many of his Confucian sayings in A Week and Walden are, I find, later additions to his first drafts.72 We do not know whether this quotation was in the lecture as he first delivered it or whether it was added afterwards. No manuscript of the lecture survives. Thus, in so far as the external evidence indicates, Thoreau could have made these translations any time between 1841 and 1849, though late 1843 seems most likely."7 As we will see, most of these translations concern the nature, or inner qualities, of the Confucian superior man and with the Confucian ideal of governing. A good number are devoted to the more mysterious aspects of Neo- Confucian naturalism.74 Of particular interest is that lengthy Confucian anec- dote-a conversation between Confucius and four of his disciples, in which Confucius asked each what he would do if he were one day famous. Three of</page><page sequence="13">Thoreau's Confucian Translations 287 them showed ambition in statesmanship; only Tian, the last to speak, expressed his wish to be free and to go with a few companions to the river Y, to take some fresh air and then return home singing. Hearing this, Confucius smiled and exclaimed that he agreed with Tian. Instead of a man of formality and conven- tion, Confucius is presented here as rather a Taoist-like individual, free and unrestrained. Notice Thoreau's own comment at the end of his translation: "For the most part I too am of the opinion of Tian" (p. 138). This anecdote, as has been noted, also appears in almost exactly the same form in the Houghton manuscript fragment.75 Since Thoreau saw fit both to translate this section and also to use it in his other work, clearly he was caught by the message the Confucian conversation insinuated. We cannot tell for sure whether it directly affected his decision to go to Walden as we have no absolute date for this translation,'7 nor for the Harvard manuscript. But Thoreau might certainly have found his justification in it: even Confucius would consider retreating into the woods. Viewing this in light of Christy's bold declaration that "No Confucius would ever have gone to Walden,"77 we would have to question who is misrepre- senting whom. Is it Thoreau who misread Confucius? Or have Thoreau scholars all along misread Thoreau's reading of Confucius? In their search for ultimate relations between man and God, self and nature, Transcendentalists like Emerson and Thoreau turned to the East as one of many sources for inspiration. The Neo-Confucian Four Books became one site for their spiritual exploration and intellectual expansion. Thoreau's translation of these texts is a typical example. Much study remains. But the recognition and publication of these translations provide us with further evidence for the Orien- tal influence on Transcendentalists in general, and on Thoreau in particular. VI In the following transcription, I adopt the editorial conventions in the Jour- nals and Miscelleneous Notebooks of Ralph Waldo Emerson. I specify in footnotes passages which appear in Thoreau's published writings. Thoreau's additions, cancellations, corrections, commentaries, and passages marked in pencil are also noted. All additions are above the line unless otherwise indi- cated. Spellings and punctuations appear as they are in the original. Manuscript page numbers are given in square brackets, while page numbers of the French text and the French titles of the Four Books appear in braces. All other instances of bracketing are Thoreau's.

In the Introduction the Translator says-{ii-iii) "Indeed it is a phenomenon which we can call extraordinary, that of the Chinese nation and the Hindoo nation preserving themselves immoveable, from the remotest origin of human societies, on the so move- able and changing scene tstages78 of the world!

Assuredly, there are there some vestiges of the eternal laws which govern the world."s3 According to Pauthier-Khoung-fou-tseu (by the missionaries Latinized Confucius) {vi- vii) "collected and put in order [128] in the second half of the sixth century before our era, all the religious, philosophical, &lt;and&gt; political and moral documents which existed in his time, and formed of them a body of doctrines, under the title of Y-King, or Sacred Book of permutations; Chou-king, or Sacred Book par excellence; Chi-king, or Book of Verses; Li-ki, or Book of Rites. &lt;The&gt; The Sse-chou, or Four Classical Books, are his sayings and maxims collected by his disciples. If one can judge of the worth of a man and of the power of his doctrines by the influence which they have exercised over Isur4, populations, one can, with the Chinese, call Khoung-tseu the greatest Instructor of the human race which the ages have ever produced." There is mention of a book called "Spring time &amp; Autumn" written by Confucius. Pauthier has translated the Chou-king in what he calls his "Livre sacres de l'Orient" from which in fact the present translation is taken.

Tseu-lou replied with a brisk but respectful air: Suppose a kingdom of a thousand war- chariots, hard-pressed [137] between other great kingdoms, add even, by numerous</page><page sequence="18">292 Studies in the American Renaissance 1993 armies, and that withal it suffers want and famine; let Yeou (T'seu-lou) be appointed to its administration, in less than three years I could accomplish that the people of this kingdom should recover a manly courage, and know their condition.

As to the rites and to music, I would entrust the teaching of them to a superior man. And you, Tchi, what do you think Tare your thoughts4,?132 The disciple replied respectfully: I will not say that I can do these things; I desire to study. When the ceremonies of the temple of ancestors are performed, and great public assemblies take place, clothed in my robe of azure and other vestments proper for such a place and such ceremonies, I could wish to take part in them in the [138] quality of a humble functionary. And you, Tian, what do you think, tare your thoughtsL?1u The disciple did nothing but draw some rare sounds from his guitar; but these sounds prolonging themselves, he laid it aside, and, rising, replied respectfully: My opinion Tdiffers entirely,1 4 from those of my three fellow disciples.-The Philosopher said: What prevents you from expressing it? Each one here can speak his thought. The disciple said: Spring time being no more, my robe of spring laid aside, but covered with the bonnet of manhood, accompanied by five or six men, and six or seven young people, I should love to go and bathe in the waters of the -Y-, to go and take the fresh air in those woody places where they offer sacrifices to heaven to obtain rain, to modulate some airs, and then return to my abode. The Philosopher applauding these words by a sign of satisfaction, said: I am of (the opinion of)'l5 Tian.('s mind.)' The three disciples departed, but Thseng-sie remained yet some time. [139] Thseng- sie said: What ought one to think of the words of these three disciples? The Philosopher said: Each one of them has expressed his opinion; that is all let voila toutl.- -He added: Master, why did you smile at the words of Yeou? The Philosopher said: &lt;Each&gt; One ought to administer a kingdom according to the established laws and customs; the words of Yeou were not modest; this is the reason I smiled. But Khieou himself, did not he also express the desire to administer a state? How should we see that in a province of sixty or seventy li, or even of fifty or sixty li in extent? that is not a kingdom. And Tchi, was it not of the affairs of a kingdom that he meant to speak? Those ceremonies of the temple of ancestors, those public assemblies, are they not the privelege of the grandest of all the orders? And Tchi how could he take part in them in the quality of a humble functionary? Who then could perform the great function?'37 For the most part I too am of the opinion of Tian. &amp;(am of Tian's mind.),-'l [140] (162.45) T'seu-lou demanded what was the superior man.

Yao and Chun themselves did thus. {162.46) Youan-jang (an ancient friend of the Philosopher) more aged than he, was seated on the road with legs crossed. The Philosopher said to him: Being a child, not to have had fraternal deference; in mature age, to have done nothing praiseworthy; arrived at old age, not to die; it is to be a good-for-nothing wretch. a worthless fellow tmy own 1' 39 --vaurien] And he struck his legs with his sticks (to make him get up). (166.20-167) The superior man demands nothing but of himself; the common Tvulgairel man and without merit demands everything of others {167.25} I have almost seen the day when the historian of the empire left blancs in his narratives 'relationsl, lstorya140 [where he was not sure of the facts] [141] {168.31} The superior man does not occupy himself but with the right way; he does not occupy himself with eating and drinking.

Their language was in harmony with reason 8 justice; while their acts were in harmony with the sentiments of men.141 What follows is from Mencius.142 {Mencius) {209.7} Another man had a thought; I, I have divined it, and given it its measure. Book of Verses [142]Mencius about a century after C.143 {235.14-236) Wen-kong, prince of Teng, put another question in these terms: The men of Thsi are on the point of surrounding with walls the state of Sie; I experience great fear at it. What ought I to do in this case? Mencius replied with respect: Formerly Tai-wang inhabited the country tlandJl of Pin; the barbarians of the north, named Joung, troubled him without ceasing by their incursions; he quitted this residence and betook himself to the foot of mount Khi, where he fixed himself; it is not from choice and deliberate purpose that he did thus, it is because he could not do otherwise. If any one practises constantly virtue, in the course of generations there will be found always among his sons and grandsons a man who will be elevated to royalty. The superior man who wishes to found a dynasty, with the intention of transmitting the sovereign</page><page sequence="20">294 Studies in the American Renaissance 1993 authority to his descendants, acts tagita, so that his enterprise can be continued. If this superior man accomplishes his work, then heaven has pronounced. Prince, what is this kingdom of Thsi to you? Exert yourself to practise [143]'" virtue [which opens the road to royalty] and confine yourself to that. [Mencius] {256.8} The ancient emperor Yu heard pronounce words of wisdom &amp; virtue, he bowed ts'inclinaitl, in sighs of veneration for receiving them.'45 {257.9) Lieou-hia-hoei said What you do belongs to you, and what I do belongs to me. If ever you should be arms naked and body naked to 1by1,46 my side, how could you soil Idefile',47 me? Mencius does not quite approve of this.'4s {258.1} It is said-It is not necessary to place the limits of a people in frontiers wholly material, nor the strength of a kingdom in the obstacles which mountains and water- courses present to the enemy, nor the imposing majesty of the empire in a great military equipage. That one who has attained to govern according to the principles of humanity &amp; justice, will find an immeasurable Iincalculablel149 support in the heart of the people. {302.7} Yang-ho desired to see Khong-tseu, but he feared lest he should not observe the rites. [It is said in the Book of Rites] "When the first functionary carried a present to [144] a learned man, if it happens that the last is not in his house to receive it, than he presents himself at the abode of the functionary to thank him for it." Yang-ho informed himself of a moment when Khoung-tseu was absent from his house, and he chose this moment to go and carry to Khong-tseu a little salt here. Khoung-tseu on his side, informed himself of a moment when Yang-ho was absent from his house to go and thank him for it. In this case Yang-ho was the first to make advances; how could Khong-tseu have avoided going to visit him? {315.5} Mencius said-Men have a constant way of speaking [without very well understanding it]. All say: the empire, the kingdom, the family. The basis of the empire exists in the kingdom; the basis of the kingdom exists in the family; the basis of the family exists in the person.'5a {317.8-318) Mencius said: Can one converse and speak the language of reason with cruel and inhuman princes. Dangers the most menacing are for them motives of [145] tranquility, calamities the most disastrous are for them subject of profit; they rejoice at that which causes their ruin. If one could converse and speak the language of reason with inhuman and cruel princes, would there be so great a number of kingdoms which perish, and of families which fail "falll? There was a young child who sang, saying; "The water of the river Thsang-lang is it pure, I can wash there uin itk tya"'51 the fillets which bind my head; 'The water of the river Thsang-lang is it troubled, I can wash there tin ita'12 my feet."

Men certainly despise themselves before other men despise them. Families certainly</page><page sequence="21">Thoreau's Confucian Translations 295 destroy themselves before men destroy them. Kingdom certainly attack themselves before men attack them.153 The Tai-kia'l says; "One can preserve himself from the calamities sent by heaven; one cannot support those which he has brought upon himself." These words say exactly what I wished to express. [146]'55 [146] {323.15} If you listen attentively to the words of a man; if you consider the pupil of his eyes, how can he conceal himself from you? {333.19} That in which men differ from brute beasts is a thing very inconsiderable; the common herd lose it very soon; superior men preserve it carefully.'~' {356.6} That which operates or produces effects without apparent action, is heaven; that which happens without one's causing it to come, is destiny. {369.3} To contract ties of friendship with any one, is to contract friendship with his virtue.

In like circum- stances, &lt;what&gt; the evil which one does in the interval of a day prevents the germs of virtues which began to spring up again from developing themselves and destroys them. After having thus prevented many times the germs of virtue which began to spring up again from developing themselves, then the beneficent breath of evening does not suffice to preserve them. As soon as the beneficent breath of evening does not suffice longer to preserve them, then the nature of man does not differ much from that of the brute. Men seeing the nature of this man like that of the brute think that he has never possessed the linnatel faculty of reason. Are those the true and natural sentiments of man?'62 {394.11-395) If one loses a fowl or dog, he knows well how to seek them again; if one loses the sentiments of his heart, he does not know how to seek them again! The duties of practical philosophy consist only in seeking after those sentiments of the heart which we have lost; that is all.'~ [148]'" {396.15-397) Koung-tou-tseulu put a question in these terms: All men resemble one another. Some are however great men, others little men; how so?

As all the population of their village boast of them without ceasing, they think themselves perfect men, and they cannot enter into the way of Yao and Chun. That is why Khoung-tseu regarded them as the pest of virtue. Mencius {285.4} lIt is said,il 'Some work with their intellect, others work with their hands. Those who work with their intellect govern men; those who work with their hands are governed by men. Those who are governed by men nourish men; those who govern men are nourished by men.'

The Houghton manuscript fragment is bMS Am 278.5, Folder 12a, and reads: But suppose his digestion is sound, still we might ask, would this man, if he were at the head of affairs, do any better than those whom he condemns? We confess that we should not like to try the experiment. We lately read an anecdote of Confucius and his disciples which is to our purpose. "Tseu-lou, Thseng-sie, Yan-yeou, Kong-si-hoa, were seated by the side of the Philoso- pher. The Philosopher said: make no account of my age more than if I were only a day older than you. Living apart and isolated, then you say: we are not known. If any one knew you, then what would you do? Tseu-lou replied with a brisk but respectful air: Suppose a kingdom of a thousand war- chariots, hard-pressed between other great kingdoms, add even, by numerous armies, and that withal it suffers want and famine; let Yeou (T'seu-lou) be appointed to its administration, in less than three years I could accomplish that the people of this kingdom should recover a manly courage, and know their condition. The Philosopher smiled at [2] these words.</page><page sequence="25">Thoreau's Confucian Translations 299 And you, Khieou, what are your thoughts? The disciple replied respectfully: Suppose a province of sxity of seventy li in extent, or even of fifty or sixty li, and that Khieou were appointed to its administration, in less than three years I could accomplish that the people should have sufficient. As to the rites and to music, I would entrust the teaching of them to a superior man. And you, Tchi, what are your thoughts? The disciple replied respectfully: I will not say that I can do these things; I desire to study. When the ceremonies of the temple of ancestors are performed, and great public assemblies take place, clothed in my robe of azure and other vestments proper for such a place and such ceremonies, I could wish to take part in them in the quality of a humble functionary. And you, Tian, what are your thoughts? The disciple did nothing but draw some rare sounds from his guitar; but these sounds prolonging thermselves, he laid it aside, and rising, replied re[3]spectfully: My opinion differs entirely from those of my three fellow disciples-The Philosopher said: What pre- vents you from expressing it? Here each one can speak his thought.-The disciple said: spring being no more, my robe of spring laid aside, but covered with the bonnet of manhood, accompanied by five or six men, and six or seven young people, I should love to go and bathe in the waters of the -Y-, and go and take the fresh air in those woody places where they offer sacrifices to heaven to obtain rain, to modulate some airs, and then return to my abode. The Philosopher applauding these words by a sign of satisfaction, said: I am of Tian's mind. The three disciples departed, but Thseng-sie remained yet some time. Thseng-sie said: What ought one to think of the words of these three disciples? The Philosopher said: Each one of them has expressed his opinion; that is all." The narrator proceeds to tell why the Philosopher smiled; but that is obvious enough. For the most part, when we listen to the conversation of the Refornmers, we too [are] of Tian's mind.

The fact that Emerson was unfamiliar with Pauthier (at this time at least) suggests that the book may not have been in Thoreau's possession in Concord. The fact that Thoreau's translations are not reflected in the "Ethnical Scriptures" selections might argue for a date after September 1843. 70. Aesthetic Papers, ed. Elizabeth P. Peabody (Boston: The Editor, 1849), p. 202. 71. Thoreau, Writings, Reform Papers, ed. Wendell Glick (1973), pp. 214, 313. 72. The first drafts of Walden and A Week do not contain the Confucian sayings. A Week was published on 26 May 1849, a few days after "Resistance to Civil Governmment" appeared in Elizabeth Palmer Peabody's Aesthetic Papers (see J. Lyndon Shanley, The Making of Walden [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1957], and Linck C. Johnson, Thoreau's Complex Weave: The Writing of A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers [Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1986]). 73. See note 69. In the early 1840s, Thoreau engaged in extensive and enthusiastic studies of the Oriental scriptures under the influence of Emerson and through Emerson's personal library. It was in 1843, as mentioned earlier, that Emerson and Thoreau made the two Confucian selections for the</page><page sequence="26">300 Studies in the American Renaissance 1993 Dial. Pauthier and his translations did not appear in Emerson's journal until 1864. Neither is Pauthier's book in Emerson's library. It is likely that Thoreau might have encountered Pauthier's text himself in the latter part of 1843 in New York where he was tutoring William Emerson's children. Bradley P. Dean, secretary of the Thoreau Society, believes, however, that 1849 is a more likely date for these translations since Thoreau began to use Confucian translations in the second drafts of A Week and Walden. Scholars generally assume that the second drafts of these writings were completed in 1849 (letter to Joel Myerson, 9 February 1992). 74. A few of these passages also appear in the Dial's Confucian selections in Marshman's and Collie's translations, such as (44.1}- {44.3}, {176.8}, {102.9), {394-395.11}. 75. bMS Am 278.5, Folder 12a; see note 64 above for a full transcription. 76. Thoreau began to live at Walden in July 1845 and left there in September 1847. The whole of his Walden days falls within the time period of his Confucian translation. 77.

'You... bends.' is struck through in pencil with a vertical line; the passage is used in "The Village," Walden, p. 172. Thoreau did not cite his source. This brought about an interesting episode of source tracing over half a century later. In 1894, Charles Francis Adams came across this quote in Walden. Struck by its "figure of speech," and its "mystical Eastern turn," he "appropriated" it in his own writing. Thirteen years later, in delivering an address on General Robert E. Lee at Lexington, Virginia, he again employed this quote. But, as he could not remember the exact source, he simply drew it from his own earlier writing. It was then that he received a letter from R. V. Lancaster, telling him that the saying he used in his speech had been quoted by a Professor Hogue of Washington and Lee University in an account of Adams' address, in which the quote was attributed to a "disciple of Emerson." Lancaster explained to Adams that this saying should be ultimately attributed to Confucius. Surprised at this, Adams wrote back to Lancaster, "reiterating" his "own surmise" that the saying, if not original with Thoreau, "went back at furthest only to Emerson." Lancaster, a missionary to China for fifteen years, showed him the source of the passage in Confucius' Lun-yii. Complaining that "Thoreau had not in any way indicated the source from whence he drew [it]," Adams resolved the case by writing to the Nation: I presume I do not stand alone in having on more than one occasion, lost sleep over the effort to place some quotation which had stuck, so to speak, in memory's crop, and in the pacing of which no collection of quotations offered any assistance or supplied a clue. In the present case I hold it to have been a notable coincidence that a poetical figure of speech found in Thoreau's work, and assumed to be taken from those of Emerson, should thus be</page><page sequence="28">302 Studies in the American Renaissance 1993 correctly placed as attributable to Confucius by a modest Presbyterian clergyman, living in an obscure village nestled in the Virginia Alleghanies; he having a knowledge of the writings of Confucius solely as he had studied them in the Chinese tongue. Such a coincicence seems to merit mention among the Curiosities of Literature. ("From Thoreau to Confucius, Via Washington Co., Virginia," 21 April 1910, pp. 399-400.) In response to Adams' correspondence, F. B. Sanborn verified Adams' finding, stating that "early readers of the Dial" would realize that Thoreau in Emerson's absence edited the magazine's "Ethnical Scriptures," which made Confucius and Mencius first "known" to "most New England readers." He confirmed Adams' source found in Thoreau as well, agreeing that "No author was named by Thoreau in citing it." But he supposed that to those "familiar with" Thoreau's Dial chapters "the turn of the phrases disclosed it as attributed to Confucius" ("Thoreau and Confucius," Nation, 12 May 1910, p. 481). 127. 'In... others).' is struck through in pencil with a vertical line; the passage is used in a draft of Walden as reported in Sanborn's Bibliophile Edition (2 vols. [Boston: Bibliophile Society, 1909], 1:127), where Thoreau states: "'In antiquity,' said Confucius, 'those who devoted themselves to study, did it for themselves; now, those who devote themselves to study, do it for others;' as a commentator says, 'to appear learned in the eyes of others.' Now, it appears to me, those who devoted themselves to charity, do it for others" quoted in Stern, Annotated Walden, p. 207). 128. 'venir a bout' is in pencil. 129.
