        <p>In this article, I attempt to write about phenomena that resist entry into the realm of
            language, namely, secret power-granting visions. I am specifically interested in the
            power-granting visions of Shuar, a group of perhaps 80,000 people indigenous to the
            Ecuadorian Amazon (in most of the travel and academic literature, they are known as
            “Jívaro,” but I avoid the term because Shuar consider it
                pejorative).<sup>1</sup> This essay is thus an
            experiment in dwelling within a cross-cultural moment in ethnographic research, the
            encounter with the unfamiliar and unsettling. I conducted research among the Shuar from
            December 1988 to February 1992 and in five summer visits since then. As I reread in my
            university office transcripts of interviews I conducted with Shuar, I realize that I did
            not fully understand the answers to my questions at the time I asked them. As I reread
            these interviews, as I do with older ethnographies, I try to imagine myself as being
            back in the field, dependent on a certain kind of suspension of disbelief, trying to
            live in a world where the things to which I must hold my research and myself
            accountable, the things I must take as real, are precisely those things my own culture
            tells me are unreal.</p>
        <p>Michael Harner (1968) made Shuar—especially
            Shuar shamans—famous for their use of hallucinogens in his article “The
            Sound of Rushing Water.” But he also pointed out that in nonshamanic contexts, all
            Shuar consumed the same hallucinogens as shamans and that all male Shuar took a
            hallucinogen more potent than that used by shamans. Moreover, adult Shuar considered it
            essential to the welfare of their children that they too consume considerable amounts of
            hallucinogens. Through life-history interviews of women conducted in 2006, I learned
            that women also took and continue to take hallucinogens and, moreover, that they
            continue to consider the provision of hallucinogens as essential to good parenting. In
            other words, shamanic visions are a specific subset of a universal set of practices. I
            began to consider the possibility that the childhood experiences of the average Shuar
            are as important as, if not more important than, the experiences of shamans to an
            understanding of the importance of visions in Shuar culture. Shuar routinely
            characterize these visions, or the encounters that occur within them, as among the most
            important moments of their lives. What is it about these visions that make them so
            important?</p>
        <p>Harner, a meticulous ethnographer, provides a straightforward answer: <disp-quote>
            <p>The
                    Jívaro believe that the true determinants of life and death are normally
                    invisible forces which can be seen and utilized only with the aid of
                    hallucinogenic drugs. The normal waking life is explicitly viewed as
                    “false” or “a lie,” and it is firmly believed that the
                    truth about causality is to be found by entering the supernatural world or what
                    the Jívaro view as the “real” world, for they feel that the
                    events which take place within it underlie and are the basis for many of the
                    surface manifestations and mysteries of daily life. (Harner 1984:135; see also Karsten 1935:444, and see Gow 2000:62 regarding a similar belief among
                    the Peruvian Piro)</p>
         </disp-quote>If Harner is right (and as best I can tell,
            this is a fairly accurate summary of what virtually every Shuar I have met believes),
            then we can no longer call the substances Shuar take “hallucinogens.” They
            are kinds of palliatives that enable one to succeed in a world of deception.<sup>2</sup> This is why women consume certain
            infusions while they are pregnant and give their babies a few drops of another infusion
            at birth. It is why parents will give a more potent infusion to a child who has
            displayed a lack of self-control; they hope that the experience will give the child the
            strength needed for self-discipline. It is why fathers will give an even stronger
            infusion to their pubescent sons, who will soon participate in feuding and warfare. As
            Ann-Christine Taylor put it, plant-granted visions continue to function for Shuar as
            “existential amplifiers” (Taylor 1993:666). But what happens in these visions that makes them sources of such
            power?</p>
        <p>Sometimes Shuar are granted visions of their future. The contents of these visions are
            kept secret until they come to pass. But there are other aspects of the experience that
            Shuar will not talk about. They willingly talk about their visions in generic terms, as
            involving an encounter with a spirit. The name of the spirit and other details of the
            encounter, however, are typically kept secret. The ethnographic question leads to a
            methodological question: how is an anthropologist to write about the unspoken?</p>
        <p>This question may seem to be methodological, based as it is in a particular ethnographic
            situation, but I consider it theoretical as well, since it leads me to reflect more
            generally on an ethnography of the ineffable. There is a line here, and after wavering
            considerably, I realize that I cannot take either side. On one side is the possibility
            that my informants are fully aware of and understand their visions, although they keep
            this knowledge secret. On the other side is the possibility that something occurs in
            visions that cannot enter speech. The possibility of the latter makes it impossible to
            know which of the two is the case. I suggest that both are in play simultaneously.</p>
        <p>In his examination of secrets, sociologist Georg Simmel (1950:312) concluded that “we simply cannot imagine any
            interaction or social relation or society which is <italic>not</italic> based on this
            teleologically determined non-knowledge of one another.” In an earlier essay in
            which I reflected on the secrets that largely defined my relationship with an individual
            Shuar, I pursued Simmel’s suggestion that the temptation to confess or betray is
            the source of the power of the secret (Rubenstein 2004:1055–1061). In the course of my fieldwork, however, I have spoken
            to many more Shuar about their visions, in an effort to learn the secrets of power. They
            readily told me about the immense importance of plant-granted visions and of the effects
            these visions had on their lives. But they repeatedly refuse to tell me what occurred in
            their visions, and they consistently insisted that some visions are kept secret from
            everyone. So this essay is at least as much about the power of secrecy as it is about
            forms of power.</p>
        <p>I would like to suggest that some secrets are powerful because they are mimetic of the
            ineffable. My use of the word “mimetic” invokes philosopher Charles Sanders
            Peirce’s triadic semiotic.<sup>3</sup> As
            Michael Taussig has shown, the mimetic faculty is often essential to the ways people
            perform their relationship to the ineffable. Like the symbolic, it is a field of power:
            “Once the mimetic has sprung into being, a terrifically ambiguous power is
            established: there is born the power to represent the world, yet that same power is a
            power to falsify, mask, and pose” (Taussig 1993:42–43).</p>
        <p>What happens in these visions that makes them sources of such power? As I suggest below,
            it may have something to do with the way visionary encounters form a kind of
            subjectivity that can stand up to a tension in Shuar culture between valuing freedom and
            valuing power. This kind of subjectivity is fundamentally distinct from the bourgeois
            subjectivity proposed by Sigmund Freud and his followers.<sup>4</sup> It is made possible by the way Shuar visions mediate the
            real and the symbolic—registers that in many ways parallel a distinction made by
            Jacques Lacan—and, consequently, by an ambivalent relationship between visions and
            speech.</p>
        <p>The central concern of psychoanalytic theory is “the unconscious,” that is,
            the thoughts and ideas a person cannot put into words, not because of some lack of
            competence but because of some mechanism of repression. One could argue that by
            definition the contents of the unconscious are not meaningful, but Freud argued that the
            unconscious <italic>works</italic> and that the workings of the unconscious have
            knowable, meaningful effects that we can talk about. Of all psychoanalytic theorists,
            Lacan was perhaps the one most concerned with the significance of the chasm between the
            unconscious and the conscious and of the ways that talk is both unavoidable and a danger
            to psychoanalysis. Lacan was concerned that analysts had come to take the role of
            language in analysis for granted without considering the ways it can distort or disguise
            as easily as it can expose and explain. He argued that “the
            Symbolic”—the order constituted through language—is a realm of
            misrecognition and impossible desires. Given the importance of secrets and distorted
            speech in Shuar culture, I believe that anthropologists must take Lacan’s concerns
            seriously as well.<sup>5</sup>
      </p>
        <p>This essay is necessarily speculative. As an “ethnography of the ineffable,”
            it is also an experimental alternative to an ethnography of
            “representation.” Although the “crisis of representation” of the
            1980s questioned the right of anthropologists to represent their informants, this crisis
            centered on an understanding of culture as representation and of ethnography as
            interpretation (see Clifford and Marcus 1986;
            Geertz 1973; Marcus and Fisher 1986). But it is important for ethnographers to
            acknowledge that our informants may have experiences and their cultures may involve
            practices, or dimensions or registers of experiences or practices, that resist
            representation.</p>
        <p>This essay thus lingers on a second encounter, between ethnographic fieldwork and
            writing. To acknowledge the importance of the secret or ineffable in the lives of our
            informants, I look for ways to write not “about” these experiences or
            customs but “around” them. There is, of course, a good deal that Shuar have
            to say about plants, visions, and powers. Just as such talk frames experiences about
            which my informants do not speak, my interpretations of this talk are forwarded to frame
            (and thus acknowledge) that which I cannot interpret.</p>
        <sec id="sc1">
            <title>Psychoanalysis and Ethnography</title>
            <p>As only a few other anthropologists have engaged Lacan (e.g., Crapanzano 1980; Ivy 1995) and my reading of Lacan is selective and not shared by all
                Lacanians, I begin with a brief comment about my approach. One reason I believe that
                anthropologists should find in Lacan’s work a productive path to engage
                psychoanalytic thought is his attention to language.<sup>6</sup> Lacan relied on Saussurian linguistics, especially the
                distinction between <italic>parole</italic> and <italic>langue</italic>, and the
                implications of the arbitrariness of the sign (see Saussure 1966 [1915]). For Lacan, the difference between signified and
                signifier constitutes an unbridgeable space of “misrecognition”
                    (<italic>méconnaissance</italic>). Lacan’s Saussurian analysis
                means that one’s language, and everything of the subject’s that is
                mediated by language, is always intimately human but also
                “Other”—alien—to one’s self.</p>
            <p>This is not the place to review the many critiques or alternatives to
                Saussure’s dualistic semiotic. In some cases, a dialogic or performative
                approach to language is more useful (some have argued that Lacan takes a
                performative approach to language in that language creates the subject; Lee 1990:75–79).<sup>7</sup> One reason I find Lacan’s reading of
                Saussure appropriate is because it resonates with a dualistic view of the world that
                permeates Shuar culture.</p>
            <p>Another reason I find it useful is that attention to the specificity of language is a
                first step to recognizing what is culturally specific and relative. As psychoanalyst
                Bruce Fink noted,<disp-quote>
               <p>We are born into a world of discourse, a discourse
                        or language that precedes our birth and that will live on after our death.
                        Long before a child is born, a place is prepared for it in its
                        parents’ linguistic universe: the parents speak of the child yet to be
                        born, try to select the perfect name for it, prepare a room for it, and
                        begin imagining what their lives will be like with an additional member of
                        the household. The words they use to talk about the child have often been in
                        use for decades if not centuries, and the parents have generally neither
                        defined nor redefined them despite many years of use. Those words are handed
                        down to them by centuries of tradition: they constitute the Other of
                        language. (Fink 1995:5)</p>
            </disp-quote>This point provides a razor for working through
                what may be universal in Lacanian thought and what may be limited to bourgeois
                culture (see Zaretsky 1976). For example,
                while the arbitrariness of the sign and the way meaning is constituted through
                difference may be universal, the appropriateness of castration as a trope to refer
                to the process of subjectivation, central to Lacanian thought, may not be. (Indeed,
                if my analysis below is correct, for Shuar the key trope of subjectivation is the
                incorporation of the visionary power).</p>
            <p>Against the Symbolic, and that which enters into language, is that which resists
                entry into language. Lacan calls this “the Real.” Since the Real does
                not enter language, it is impossible to describe it directly; we can, however,
                imagine what it is not. For example, we can try to imagine the consciousness of a
                baby before it has any awareness of language. Lacan sometimes speaks of the Real and
                the Symbolic as developmental stages—babies are born, as Freud wrote,
                “polymorphously perverse” (meaning that the entire body is an unbroken
                erogenous zone, for which anything can be an object of erotic gratification).
                        <disp-quote>
               <p>So too, Lacan’s real is without zones, subdivisions,
                        localized highs and lows, or gaps and plenitudes: the real is a sort of
                        unrent, undifferentiated fabric, woven in such a way as to be full
                        everywhere, there being no space between the threads that are its
                        “stuff.” It is a sort of smooth, seamless surface or space which
                        applies as much to a child’s body as to the whole universe. (Fink
                            1995:24)</p>
            </disp-quote>As the
                baby enters the Symbolic order, “in the course of socialization, the body is
                progressively written or overwritten with signifiers: pleasure is localized in
                certain zones, while other zones are neutralized by the word and coaxed into
                compliance with social, behavioral norms” (Fink 1995:24). Lacan explicitly distinguishes the Real from
                “reality.” Since we cannot put the Real into words, it does not exist as
                such. It is the Symbolic that constitutes reality (see Berger and Luckman 1966): “a world that can be designated
                and discussed with the words provided by a social group’s (or
                subgroup’s) language” (Fink 1995:25).</p>
            <p>Although one may identify the Real and the Symbolic with developmental stages, they
                coexist: a baby is born into a world of language, and older people begin encoding
                its body as soon as it is born (and in many societies, before). Similarly, the Real
                is a spectral presence through the life of the individual; Lacan (1978:vii) identifies it as the
                    unconscious.<sup>8</sup> “The real is
                perhaps best understood as <italic>that which has not yet been symbolized</italic>,
                remains to be symbolized, or even resists symbolization; and it may perfectly well
                exist ‘alongside’ and in spite of a speaker’s considerable
                linguistic capabilities” (Fink 1995:25). In this sense, the Real and the Symbolic are better thought of as
                registers than as developmental stages.</p>
            <p>Between the Real and the Symbolic is another stage, or register: the Imaginary. The
                Imaginary consists of images people form of themselves and others.<sup>9</sup> For Lacan—in sharp contrast
                to other psychoanalysts—“the foremost imaginary object is the ego”
                (Fink 1995:84). Whereas many psychologists
                and sociologists refer to this process of self-definition as
                “intersubjective” (Mead 1934,
                    1964), Lacan terms the ego
                    “<italic>moi</italic>,” “me” (the objective case; the
                “me” is acted upon), in contrast to the subject, the “I”
                that acts. While other psychoanalysts (especially in the United Kingdom and the
                United States) sought to help strengthen the ego of their analysands, Lacan viewed
                the Imaginary as the problem. He argued that “it is an analyst’s job to
                intervene in the patient’s real, not in the patient’s view of
                reality” (Fink 1995:25)—that is,
                in the unconscious, the unspeakable.</p>
            <p>Cultural anthropologists face some problems that are very similar to those of
                psychoanalysts. It is often quite obvious to me that those Shuar who represent
                themselves to me most articulately are those who, having considerable experience
                talking to Euro-Americans or Europeans, have learned how to reflect back to me what
                they believe I wish to hear (and, certainly, what is most intelligible to me). I
                suggest that one reason anthropologists and colonized peoples (such as Native
                Americans) so often have conflicting anxieties about “cultural
                representations” is that such representations are “Imaginary” in
                the Lacanian sense, a self-serving or defensive construction that “makes
                sense” in the context of whatever politics constitutes the ethnic boundary at
                the time but usually fails in some way when it is actually taken to be identical to
                the collective subject.<sup>10</sup>
         </p>
            <p>Moreover, cultural relativism is at least in part a theory of cultural repression, in
                that it posits that “culture” often shapes our thoughts, feelings, and
                actions in unreflexive ways—a powerful idea but one that creates all sorts of
                hermeneutic problems. For example, I worry that the forms of ethnocentrism I can
                most easily express and explain in language are the least serious of the biases that
                threaten my understanding of another culture. Often, the questions that I ask my
                informants demand that they put into words things the meaning of which may best be
                indexed by how hard it is for them to do so.</p>
            <p>In this essay, I use the Lacanian registers of the Imaginary and the Symbolic to
                refer to developmental stages because I am in part raising questions about
                early-childhood socialization. But I am even more interested in how I, as an
                anthropologist, can use these terms as registers, to make sense of what does not
                enter Shuar discourse by examining it in relation to what does enter Shuar
                discourse. A brief consideration of one of Jacques Lacan’s most notable essays
                both highlights the contrast between Shuar culture and our own and illuminates some
                of these seemingly mysterious features of Shuar culture, especially the questions,
                What makes the encounter with the <italic>arútam wakán′</italic>
                so important to Shuar, and Why must key elements of this encounter be kept
                secret?</p>
            <p>
            <italic>The mirror stage</italic>. An important phase in childhood socialization
                involves the internalization of one’s self-image (Grosz 1990:46). According to Lacan, an important moment in this
                phase is the “mirror stage,” which not only inaugurates “the
                Imaginary” but also effects an essential split in the subject. Some have
                argued that Lacan uses the term “mirror” metaphorically (e.g., Homer
                    2005:24; Laplanche 1976:81). Perhaps this is because the term is used
                metaphorically by so many other psychoanalysts, especially followers of
                object-relations theory. Yet Lacan and object-relations theorists were careful to
                emphasize the differences between them.<sup>11</sup> I suspect that this reading reflects the ways that actual
                mirrors are taken for granted in bourgeois society; it effaces bourgeois dependence
                on mirrors (indeed, I believe that part of the power of Lacan’s reflections is
                to suggest a profound ambivalence that is reenacted daily by virtually every member
                of the bourgeois upon preparing for bed, waking up, urinating, or defecating).<sup>12</sup>
         </p>
            <p>I share the view of those who read Lacan as referring to an actual mirror in part
                because this is the means of the apprehension of one’s body as a whole (rather
                than feelings about one’s self) and because (unlike the faces of other people)
                it reflects an image that is simultaneously “accurate … as well as
                delusory” (Grosz 1990:39; see also
                Fink 1995:36; Metz 1982:46; Silverman 1996:10–11). In the mirror stage, the child identifies with an
                image <italic>of itself</italic>. My point is to highlight the importance of the
                asocial or antisocial (and thus objective) elements of the mirror stage.<sup>13</sup> Metaphorical mirroring reflects
                the mother’s intentions, feelings, or desires. An actual mirror conveys to the
                child nothing but what the child projects onto the mirror, recast according to the
                optical properties of the mirror.</p>
            <p>Lacan was taken by the fact that “the human child, at an age when he is for a
                short while, but for a while nonetheless, outdone by the chimpanzee in instrumental
                intelligence, can already recognize his own image as such in a mirror” (Lacan
                    2006 [1949]:75). This image is mimetic
                of the child’s actions; that is, it establishes an iconic but not symbolic
                representation of the child:<disp-quote>
               <p>This act … immediately gives rise
                        in a child to a series of gestures in which he playfully experiences the
                        relationship between the movements made in the image and the reflected
                        environment, and between this virtual complex and the reality it
                        duplicates—namely, the child’s own body, and the persons and
                        even things around him. (Lacan 2006
                            [1949]:75)</p>
            </disp-quote>For Lacan, this fact plays a decisive
                role in the psychological development of the child between the ages of 6 and 18
                    months.<sup>14</sup> It provides the child
                with a whole or gestalt image of itself, one that “symbolizes the
                    <italic>I</italic>’s mental permanence” at a time when the child
                cannot walk and is still nursing, that is, a time of “motor impotence and
                nursling dependence” (Lacan 2006
                    [1949]:76). It is thus a glimpse of the future—of the autonomous
                whole the child may become—while at the same time a distortion, especially
                given that, as a mirror image, it presents the child with an image that is literally
                the reverse of the child’s embodied perspective.</p>
            <p>In short, the first occasion the infant has to form a self-image, an identity of
                itself as a singular whole, the infant identifies with an image that
                    <italic>is</italic> and <italic>is</italic>
                <italic>not</italic> itself: the distorted image of the mirror. The child cannot but
                have an ambivalent relation to its self-image; there is always a gap
                    (<italic>béance</italic>) between one’s experience of one’s
                self and one’s image of one’s self. What the child ultimately beholds
                is, in Lacan’s terms, its own “want-of-being.” The mirror stage is
                just the first time in a lifetime during which the subject will hold onto an image
                of itself that displaces one’s physical self, an image that, for Lacan, is
                forever inauthentic, displaced from a truth that is itself absent.</p>
            <p>This mirror image is “the symbolic matrix in which the <italic>I</italic> is
                precipitated in a primordial form, prior to being objectified in the dialectic of
                identification with the other, and before language restores to it, in the universal,
                its function as subject” (Lacan 2006
                    [1949]:76). That the precipitation of a “self” that is
                fundamentally alienated from itself occurs through an encounter with the
                baby’s own image of itself means that any future mirroring with anyone else
                will only feed an illusion. As Lacan wrote, “the important point is that this
                form situates the agency known as the ego, prior to its social determination, in a
                fictional direction that will forever remain irreducible for any individual”
                (Lacan 2006 [1949]:76). (Inter alia,
                Lacan’s model suggests that the ego forms as a result of acts of recognition
                or misrecognition. This view contrasts with the popular belief that one begins with
                an ego or self-image that can be influenced by acts of recognition or
                misrecognition.)</p>
            <p>The literal mirror gives way to metaphorical mirroring, and the child’s ego
                takes shape in this social milieu:<disp-quote>
               <p>“Imaginary relations”
                        are not illusory relationships—relationships that don’t
                            <italic>really</italic> exist—but rather relations between egos,
                        wherein everything is played out in terms of but one opposition: same or
                        different. They involve other people who you consider to be
                            <italic>like</italic> yourself for a variety of reasons. It could be
                        because the two of you look very much alike, are similar in size or age, and
                        so on. In the case of an infant, it is generally that child in the family,
                        extended family, or circle of friends who bears the greatest affinity to the
                        infant in terms of size, age, interests and abilities and who also stands in
                        a similar relation to a parental or authority figure. (Fink 1995:84–85)</p>
            </disp-quote>The
                mirror stage ends as a developmental stage with the child’s acquisition of
                language. But the Imaginary continues as a register, alongside the Symbolic, because
                the <italic>béance</italic> of the mirror stage haunts all future social
                relations.</p>
            <p>Through language, the child, and then the adult, can actively seek a recognition it
                can never receive. As Jonathan Lee explained,<disp-quote>
               <p>What the child would
                        appear to ask for, in her first attempts at speech, is the satisfaction of
                        her bodily <italic>needs</italic>. But what Lacan emphasizes is that the
                        linguistic translation of these needs—what he calls
                            <italic>demand</italic>—is inherently interpersonal: demand is
                        always addressed to another person, at first a parent or caretaker. Indeed,
                        the child is not simply asking for food when she demands this of her parent;
                        rather, she is using the demand for food to provoke the parent, the other,
                        into recognizing her existence as a force to be contended with. In such
                        recognition is held the promise of something to fill the
                            <italic>béance</italic> between body and <italic>moi</italic>,
                        and it is that which is at the heart of what the child will regard as
                        parental love. In short, the child’s demand for food actually masks a
                        deeper longing for recognition by the other, recognition that will in some
                        way make up for the child’s fundamental want-of-being. It is this
                        profound but always only implicit longing for recognition—itself a
                        product of the mirror stage—that Lacan designates by the term
                            <italic>desire</italic> (Lee 1990:58–59).</p>
            </disp-quote>This desire can never be
                fulfilled; that is, the child’s want-of-being can never be fulfilled, because
                any other person to whom one might direct one’s desire suffers from the same
                want-of-being. Although this problem has its origin in the mirror stage, for Lacan
                it is ultimately a problem in and with language. Because one’s words are
                always the words of someone else, they are never really one’s own (Lee 1990:49–50).</p>
            <p>If there is any truth in the mirror image, it concerns the impossibility of
                self-identity, an instruction that is confirmed or seconded in language itself
                (where the signifier can never be itself). But this negativity can be read as a
                positive: the suggestion that the infant may become something else. Such a
                “becoming,” in which some parts blossom as others wither or drop off, or
                as some parts unhinge as others connect, may have more in common with the corporeal
                experience of the baby—disorganized, not fully in control—than with the
                image of the baby as whole. All an analyst can do, according to Lacan, is challenge
                the analysand to reject misrecognitions and unfulfillable desires and accept that
                what we are today is not what we were yesterday or will be tomorrow. Lacan ends his
                reflections on the mirror stage with an enigmatic but hopeful note: “In the
                subject to subject recourse we preserve, psychoanalysis can accompany the patient to
                the ecstatic limit of the ‘<italic>Thou art that</italic>,’ where the
                cipher of his mortal destiny is revealed to him, but it is not in our sole power as
                practitioners to bring him to the point where the true journey begins” (Lacan
                    2006 [1949]:81).</p>
            <p>What is at stake, for psychoanalysts and anthropologists alike, is to understand how
                people are able to forge meaningful lives in a world not of their making. This
                accomplishment depends not only on the cultural resources available but also on the
                kind of subjectivity. In the remainder of this essay, I use Lacan’s concepts
                of the Real, the Imaginary, and the Symbolic to explore how visions played such an
                important role in the pursuit of a meaningful life among Shuar, in part through the
                constitution of a different kind of subject.</p>
            <p>To be crystal clear: I take Lacan’s mirror stage as determinate of a certain
                kind of subjectivity and not of subjectivity as such. Among Shuar, I argue,
                plant-granted visions created a different kind of subject, one whose freedom does
                not depend on some sovereignty. This kind of subject did not inhabit a world
                innocent of misrecognition and violence—on the contrary!—but
                misrecognition and violence were organized in this world in ways that contrast
                starkly with those of the bourgeois world.</p>

            <title>Shuar Culture, 1916–1964</title>
            <p>Most Shuar live in the <italic>montaña</italic>: the easternmost foothills of
                the Andes and the uppermost fringe of the Amazon rainforest, between 400 and 1,200 m
                above sea level, mostly in present-day Ecuador. They are one of several neighboring
                groups that are culturally and linguistically similar—the Achuar (in Ecuador
                and Peru), the Huambisa and the Aguaruna (or Awajún) in Peru—that
                anthropologists refer to as Jivaroan. My claims are restricted to the Shuar,
                although I also draw on research in neighboring groups.</p>
            <p>My claims are also restricted to a specific period, before I began my fieldwork. To
                explain: this article is motivated by questions that arose during my own fieldwork,
                but it is based on the realization that I must look beyond the historical horizons
                of my fieldwork for the answers. During my research I often experience a feeling of
                dislocation, because I have to interpret what informants tell me in terms of two
                frames of reference. One involves institutions with fixed, material locations: the
                Shuar Federation headquarters, the hospital, the marketplace, all in the town of
                Sucúa; outside of town, a Shuar <italic>centro</italic> (“center”
                or community, i.e., nucleated settlement), someone’s house, a garden, a
                river—most talk centers on events or interests that have some clear
                relationship to one of these places. Sometimes, however, this talk seems to drift
                somewhere past me. I have come to realize that I could follow what people were
                saying (even if they were speaking in Spanish, as they often did in conversation,
                and which I relied on in my interviews) only in reference to key Shuar
                    terms—<italic>kakáram</italic>, <italic>kajeka</italic>,
                    <italic>akasma</italic>, and so on.</p>
            <p>I have since learned that most of my Shuar friends experience this dislocation too.
                The Shuar world (by which I simply mean that world most easily described in the
                Shuar language) has been shattered by the market economy, bureaucratic and
                hierarchical political institutions, the spatial relations of the state, and writing
                as the authoritative form of knowledge. This process began when poor Ecuadorians
                from the highlands began to settle in Shuar territory, in small numbers in the 1920s
                and in large numbers in the late 1950s. Missionary activities (mostly by Catholics
                of the Salesian Order but by some evangelical Christians as well) paralleled those
                of Ecuadorians, and the state assigned jurisdiction of a Shuar reserve to the
                Salesians in 1935. Shuar children were educated in larger numbers at mission
                boarding schools starting in the 1940s (although family continued to have an
                important role in socialization during visits home).</p>
            <p>The creation of the Federation of Shuar <italic>Centros</italic> in 1964 by Salesian
                missionaries and their alumni signaled a remarkable reconfiguration of colonial
                forces. The Ecuadorian state recognized a degree of Shuar political autonomy; in
                return, the Federation accepted the role of primary agent of modernization
                (Rubenstein 2001). This was achieved in
                part through a reorganization of Shuar social and spatial relations and in part
                through the creation of schools in which Shuar with specialized training would teach
                Shuar children to read and write in Spanish. As late as the 1950s, most Shuar
                maintained a way of life consistent with accounts from the seventeenth, eighteenth,
                and nineteenth centuries.<sup>15</sup> Within
                a few years of the Federation’s founding, its structures, discourses, and
                practices had replaced this way of life (Harner 1984:210). As far as I can tell, all Shuar discourse has been recast in
                terms of missionary discourse (or, for younger Shuar, that of the United Nations and
                NGOs; see Boster 2003). Beyond this
                discourse, however, most Shuar see something else. The world of the Shuar language
                remains vividly meaningful to most of my informants, even though so many of its
                material referents have given way to a new order.</p>
            <p>To make sense of Shuar visions within the frame of reference of the Shuar language, I
                must rely on accounts of Shuar life before the founding of the Federation. I rely on
                ethnographies by Rafael Karsten (fieldwork: 1916–1919, 1928–1929),
                Matthew Stirling (fieldwork: 1930–1931), and Michael Harner (fieldwork:
                1956–1959, 1964, 1969). Written at different times, these works are relatively
                consistent with one another and, in many ways, with what Shuar tell me today. But, I
                must emphasize, what they describe is <italic>not</italic> the material world in
                which Shuar operate today.</p>
            <sec id="sc2.1">
                <title>Power/Knowledge</title>
                <p>What are we to make of Harner’s claim that for Shuar the normal waking life
                    is false and the world accessed through hallucinogenic drugs true? Harner is
                    using “the real” to denote a realm that we do not recognize but that
                    has all the qualities the word “real” connotes for us.<sup>16</sup> I am not sure whether the
                    distinction between the natural and the supernatural applies in Shuar culture,
                    but Shuar certainly distinguish between the world that can be seen, understood,
                    and manipulated without the aid of specific plants and the world that they can
                    see through the aid of such plants.<sup>17</sup> All Shuar I have met are convinced that the visions
                    made possible through the consumption of these plants are always true and are
                    irreplaceable sources of power, although I never heard a Shuar refer to the
                    ordinary world as “false” or “a lie.” Against the true
                    or real world, I suggest that Shuar view the normal waking life as <italic>a
                        world of signification</italic> and understand that there is always some gap
                    between a sign and its object. It may not be a false world, but it is a world of
                    falsehood and deception.</p>
                <p>Their beliefs in the importance of visions do not make Shuar dreamy, otherworldly
                    people. Harner noted that “the Jívaro seem proud of their ability
                    to judge for themselves the usefulness of continuing or changing their
                    traditional behavior on very pragmatic and personal grounds” (Harner 1984:196). Indeed, the more time I spend
                    in the company of Shuar, the more certain I am that “pragmatic” is
                    the single best English word to describe their outlook on life. Although they
                    would translate our words “to think” and “to feel” as
                    one word, <italic>enentaimsatin</italic>, when discussing with Shuar how one
                    does this activity, people regularly explain that it involves considering the
                    consequences of one’s actions. In fact, there is another word that one can
                    use for “to feel,” <italic>nekáp-ra</italic>, but this word
                    is explicitly sensual (rather than emotional) and is also used to mean “to
                    experiment.”</p>
                <p>I suspect that it is this pragmatic sensibility that led Ann-Christine Taylor,
                    who conducted field research among the Achuar, to exclaim,<disp-quote>
                  <p>Indeed,
                            they have very few explicit theories about anything, and have little
                            taste or talent for explicating the self-evident. There are no
                            specialists of metaphysical lore and ritual in this society: even
                            shamans are considered experts in the manipulation of certain kinds of
                            relations rather than holders of specialized knowledge. (Taylor 1993:658)</p>
               </disp-quote>Certainly, Shuar shamans do have specialized
                    knowledge, especially knowledge they purchase from neighboring Runa
                    (Quichua-speaking) Indians. But this knowledge is perhaps closer to the Hellenic
                    notion of <italic>technê</italic>, craft (specifically, techniques to harm
                    or heal others), than to <italic>epistêmê</italic>,
                    “pure” knowledge. Similarly, the dualistic view of the world
                    observed by Harner may be considered a Shuar metaphysics, but I would suggest
                    that a Shuar epistemology (if the term is even appropriate) takes the form of
                    practices through which Shuar bump into the “true” world and seek to
                    make use of its powers. Shuar hold that visions are “true” because
                    of the clear effects these visions have on their lives. Whether Shuar are
                    ingesting vision-granting plants or attending Catholic missionary or Ecuadorian
                    schools, they do so for comparable reasons: to gain useful—that is,
                    empowering—knowledge.</p>

                <title>Shuar Social Organization</title>
                <p>Before the formation of the Shuar Federation, Shuar had no territorial or
                    political center, and the basic unit of Shuar social life was the politically
                    and economically autonomous family (Harner 1984:41; Karsten 1935:183;
                    Stirling 1938:38). There was no one
                    Shuar society; there were many scores of autonomous social groups, linked by
                    very fluid kinship networks, trading partnerships, and alliances. Each social
                    group was organized through one or a cluster of houses; houses would be
                    abandoned and relocated every 5–9 years.</p>
                <p>Men and women played distinct and complementary roles in the production of food,
                    social life, and warfare. The typical house consisted of a husband, two or three
                    wives, unmarried sons, daughters, and sons-in-law.<sup>18</sup> Clusters of households were organized through
                    alliances between sons-in-law and a father-in-law.<sup>19</sup> Sometimes closely allied houses would be
                    200–300 yards apart; more typically, they were spread along a small river
                    at half-mile intervals (Harner 1984:78).<sup>20</sup>
                    Following Harner’s calculations, there were more than 200 such social
                    groups in 1956–1957. The actual number would fluctuate over time as old
                    groups dissolved into new ones.</p>
                <p>Shuar are famous for their hatred of authority. According to Harner, Shuar were
                    well known “as an individualistic people intensely jealous of their
                    freedom and unwilling to be subservient to authority, even among
                    themselves” (Harner 1984:1). This
                    value extended to relations between parents and children and was central to
                    enculturation. Stirling reported that “young children are very seldom
                    disciplined in spite of which, like most primitive children, they are very well
                    behaved. The children, especially young boys, have almost complete liberty to do
                    as they please” (although children who broke clay pots or stole meat, the
                    availability of which was unpredictable, could be punished through the use of
                    stinging nettles or the smoke of hot peppers; Stirling 1938:111; see also Harner 1984:89–90).</p>
                <p>Shuar parents located their children in extended bilateral networks of kin. These
                    networks are in part structured through Dravidian kinship terminology. They are
                    also structured by a distinction between <italic>nekás</italic> (true)
                    and <italic>kana</italic> (branch) relatives, a distinction that is clear-cut
                    for a small fraction of one’s kindred and negotiable for the rest (Harner
                        1984:97–98). Yet it is the
                    position of any other Shuar in this network that determines whether he or she
                    may be counted on as an ally. And it is the position of any Shuar one encounters
                    in the networks of others that determines whether he or she is an enemy.</p>
                <p>Like others, one important way Shuar socialized their children was through
                    language and speech. “Fathers often spend an hour or more before dawn
                    lecturing their sons on the degree of relationship between a variety of enemies
                    and friends in their own and other neighborhoods” (Harner 1984:103). According to Karsten, these
                    lectures emphasize the child’s obligation to avenge old offenses.
                    “This discourse is, at times, repeated every morning when the house-father
                    gets up, said with about the same words, and, of course, cannot fail to make an
                    impression upon the minds of the young ones” (Karsten 1935:260).</p>
                <p>The principal means by which Shuar parents socialized their children, however,
                    was through the use of vision-granting plants, which they believe to be a source
                    of knowledge and power.<sup>21</sup>
                    Parents fed children the masticated leaf of the <italic>tsentsemp</italic>
                        (<italic>Matelea rivularis</italic>) either just before a newborn was
                    brought to its mother’s breast (Karsten 1935:226) or when it was a few days old (Harner 1984:84), to ensure that it would be
                    healthy, and again when the child was 2 or 3 years old (Karsten 1935:234).<sup>22</sup> Periodically, members of a household staged
                    “feasts” during which everyone (including small children) would fast
                    for a day and then consume <italic>natem</italic> (an infusion from the vine
                        <italic>Banisteriopsis caapi</italic>) to the point of vomiting, upon which
                    they would sleep to intense visions of the future.<sup>23</sup> Upon waking, people breakfasted on mashed manioc
                    or plantains and then fasted the rest of the day to take more
                        <italic>natem</italic> that night. This practice was repeated for several
                    days, as it was believed to make people stronger and cleverer and was considered
                    part of the children’s education (Karsten 1935:434–435). Youngsters who were blatantly irresponsible,
                    especially those who were not respectful of their parents’ knowledge or
                    authority, were given <italic>maíkua</italic> (an infusion from the plant
                        <italic>Brugmansia suaveolens</italic>), which caused the child to have
                    visions through the night.<sup>24</sup>
                    This was considered not a punishment but rather a means of education, for the
                    child was thus put into contact with the invisible world and shown the same
                    truths known to adults or may have encountered an <italic>arútam</italic>
                    (power-granting vision) and been given adult powers (Harner 1984:90).<sup>25</sup> At some point in time, daughters between the ages
                    of 2 and 8 years were made to refrain from eating meat for a week before a 4-day
                    festival in which they would dance during the day and consume
                        <italic>tsentsemp</italic> and <italic>tsáank</italic> (an infusion
                    made from <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> L.) at night, in the hope of
                    encountering an <italic>arútam</italic> and to ensure that they would
                    grow up to be healthy and strong women (Harner 1984:90–91).<sup>26</sup> Similarly, sometime after the age of 6 a boy would
                    fast and hike for several days with his father to a waterfall, where he would
                    consume <italic>tsáank</italic> and sometimes
                        <italic>maíkua</italic>, explicitly to encounter an
                        <italic>arútam</italic> in a visionary state that could last up to 3
                            days.<disp-quote>
                  <p>Of all a boy’s childhood experiences, nothing
                            is considered to compare in importance with the experience. The power
                            deriving from the acquired <italic>arutam</italic> soul is seen in
                            Jívaro terms as an enculturating and socializing device, since
                            its force is believed to promote almost all the value aspects of
                            character, including honesty, inclination to work, and intelligence; as
                            well as to increase the actual knowledge of the child. (Harner 1984:91)</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
                <p>In addition to their love of freedom, Shuar are also well known for their
                    bellicosity. Karsten wrote, “The Jibaros are no doubt at present the most
                    warlike of all Indian tribes in South America” (Karsten 1935:259). Stirling agreed: “At the
                    present time the Jivaros are without doubt the most warlike group in all South
                    America, and it is probable that this statement would hold true for the past
                    century” (Stirling 1938:41). In
                    perhaps more measured tones, Harner remarked,<disp-quote>
                  <p>It should not be
                            unexpected that the leaders in Jívaro society are outstanding
                            killers and shamans. Although such leadership is informal, almost all
                            neighborhoods have at least one or two noted killers and a few superior
                            shamans who are valued as protectors of their neighboring relatives, or
                            at least of those with whom they are on friendly terms. Such leadership
                            roles are earned and, in the case of the killers, acquired literally
                            through life-and-death struggles. (Harner 1984:111)</p>
               </disp-quote>This situation, in which
                    leadership is not institutionalized and may be sought by anyone who dares,
                    conforms to what political anthropologists called an “egalitarian
                    society,” a society that “does not have any means of fixing or
                    limiting the number of persons capable of exerting power” (Fried 1967:33).<sup>27</sup> Shuar culture did, however, provide distinct paths
                    to power, each involving different techniques involving vision-granting plants
                    through which one could access the real world.</p>

                <p>
               <italic>Uwishín</italic> is typically glossed as “shaman” or

                        “<italic>curandero/a</italic>” (healer).
                        <italic>Uwishíns</italic> arguably have the most developed technology
                    for accessing and manipulating the invisible real world and thus provide a
                    paradigmatic example of how Shuar interact with the real world (Noll 1985). An <italic>uwishín</italic>
                    is someone who, through an apprenticeship with another
                        <italic>uwishín</italic>, has purchased <italic>tsentsak</italic>
                    (shamanic darts) and learned how (after a preparatory period using
                        <italic>tsáank</italic>) to use <italic>natem</italic> to contain,
                    control, and use <italic>tsentsak</italic> to either harm or heal others (Harner
                        1984:152–166).</p>
                <p>According to Harner, <italic>uwishíns</italic> believe that all
                        <italic>tsentsak</italic> have a material and a nonmaterial aspect;
                        <italic>uwishíns</italic> swallow material aspects (e.g., insects,
                    plants) that bring with them their nonmaterial aspect. To harm another person,
                    an <italic>uwishín</italic> blows a <italic>tsentsak</italic> in the
                    direction of the intended victim, who is struck by the nonmaterial aspect. An
                        <italic>uwishín</italic> who is about to cure first examines the
                        patient—<italic>natem</italic> enables the
                        <italic>uwishín</italic> to see the ordinary world and the otherwise
                    hidden, or “true,” world simultaneously—to see whether the
                    patient has indeed been struck by a <italic>tsentsak</italic> and, if so, to
                    identify the malevolent <italic>uwishín</italic>. The healing
                        <italic>uwishín</italic> then puts a <italic>tsentsak</italic> (both
                    material and nonmaterial aspects) in his or her mouth. The nonmaterial
                        <italic>tsentsak</italic> catches and contains the nonmaterial
                        <italic>tsentsak</italic> wounding the patient’s body. The
                        <italic>uwishín</italic> then vomits out the
                        <italic>tsentsak</italic> and can show the patient the material aspect as
                    evidence of the cure (Harner 1984:162–163). One may say that Shuar use a material but
                    ineffective analogue for an immaterial but effective instrument. I suggest that
                    this dual aspect of the <italic>tsentsak</italic>, the use of something that is
                    perceivable in the ordinary world and mimetic of something in the invisible
                    “true” world, is paradigmatic of other techniques (as I suggest
                    below when analyzing <italic>arútams</italic> and <italic>anent</italic>)
                    for bridging the distance between these two worlds (see Taussig 1993:16).</p>

                <p>Preoccupied with killing, Shuar were more concerned with two other invisible

                        <italic>arútam</italic>.<sup>29</sup> Shuar provide a generic mise en scène for the
                    acquisition of an <italic>arútam wakán′</italic>. The most
                    detailed account comes from Harner and focuses on men:<disp-quote>
                  <p>If the
                                <italic>arutam</italic> seeker is fortunate, he will awaken at about
                            midnight to find the stars gone from the sky, the earth trembling, and a
                            great wind felling the trees of the forest amidst thunder and lightning.
                            To keep from being blown down he grasps a tree trunk and awaits the
                                <italic>arutam</italic>. Shortly the <italic>arutam</italic> appears
                            from the depths of the forest, often in the form of a pair of large
                            creatures. The particular animal forms can vary considerably, but some
                            of the most common <italic>arutam</italic> include a pair of giant
                            jaguars fighting one another as they roll over and over towards the
                            vision seeker, or two anacondas doing the same. Often the vision may
                            simply be a huge disembodied human head or a ball of fire drifting
                            toward the forest toward the <italic>arutam</italic> seeker. When the
                            apparition arrives to within twenty or thirty feet, the Jívaro
                            must run forward and touch it, either with a small stick or his hand.
                            This is said to require a good deal of courage, and sometimes the person
                            flees the <italic>arutam</italic> instead. But if he does run forward
                            and touch the vision, it instantly explodes like dynamite and
                            disappears. (Harner 1984:138)</p>
               </disp-quote>The seeker then returns home but tells
                    no one of his success. Instead, he sleeps on the bank of the nearest river so
                    that the <italic>arútam</italic>, in the form of an old man, may return
                    to him in his dreams, reveal himself to be the
                        <italic>wakán′</italic> (spirit) of one of the seeker’s
                    ancestors, inform the seeker of his fate, and then enter the seeker’s
                        body.<sup>30</sup> “Upon
                    acquiring this <italic>arutam</italic> soul, the person feels a sudden power
                    surge into his body, accompanied by a new self-confidence” (Harner 1984:139; see also Taylor 1993:660–661). One who possesses an
                        <italic>arútam</italic> is a <italic>kakáram</italic>, a
                    powerful one, and cannot be killed. Indeed, one feels an overwhelming desire to
                    kill, and a successful and long-lived <italic>kakáram</italic> might have
                    killed dozens of people (see Rival 2005:304–305 on the importance of the relation between the body
                    and the soul in Amazonian understandings of the desire to kill).</p>
                <p>The acquisition and use of <italic>arútam wakán′</italic>
                    provided the basis of precolonial Shuar power; the difficulties in accumulating
                    and controlling it provided the basis for Shuar egalitarianism. According to
                    Taylor, the content of the <italic>wakán′</italic>’s message
                    “as well as the identity of the dead Jivaroan who issues it must
                    henceforth be shrouded in utmost secrecy” (2007:146). One way an <italic>arútam
                        wakán′</italic> could be lost was talking about one’s
                    visions. Since warriors on the eve of a raid customarily took turns describing
                    their <italic>arútam</italic> to one another, a young warrior would have
                    to seek new <italic>arútam</italic> sometime in the future (Harner 1984:140). Moreover, they also believed
                    that after inhabiting the same body for 3 or 4 years, an <italic>arútam
                        wakán′</italic> would begin wandering about at night, as the
                    warrior slept. During such nocturnal walks it could be acquired by someone else
                    (Harner 1984:141). The
                        <italic>arútam wakán′</italic> inhabited people but did
                    not belong to them. Shuar thus depended on a power that circulated, and while
                    one could harness this circulation, one could never control it absolutely or
                    permanently (see Clastres 1989:209–210). Shuar culture thus allowed for the concentration of
                    power, but only ephemerally.</p>
                <p>Sooner or later a warrior lost all of his <italic>arútam
                        wakán′</italic> and eventually died. Like nonwarriors, Shuar
                    believed, warriors also possess a <italic>nekás
                        wakán′</italic> (a “true” or “ordinary”
                    soul) that, upon death, takes the form of a demon (<italic>iwianch</italic>).
                    The <italic>iwianch</italic> represents the opposite of a fulfilling life; it is
                    an ugly spirit consumed by perpetual hunger and loneliness (Karsten 1935:373; Harner 1984:144). Through their beliefs about
                        <italic>arútam wakán′</italic>, however, Shuar men
                    transformed death from an experience of emptiness and consumption into a source
                    of power and productivity. For it was at the moment of his own death that a
                    warrior’s <italic>own</italic>
                    <italic>arútam wakán′</italic>—the same number that he
                    had possessed over the course of his life—would come into existence
                    (Harner 1984:143).</p>
                <p>A great warrior could attempt to will his <italic>arútam
                        wakán′</italic> to his sons, by instructing them to leave his
                    corpse seated on a stool and leaning against the center-post of the men’s
                    end of his house. The sons and sometimes sons-in-law would then take turns each
                    night to take <italic>tsáank</italic>, enter the house in darkness, touch
                    the corpse, and announce, “I am your son, father,” in the hopes of
                    encountering an <italic>arútam wakán′</italic> (this ritual
                    thus enacts the quest for an <italic>arútam</italic> through a
                        <italic>maíkua</italic>-granted vision; in this case, the corpse
                    stands in for the <italic>wakán′</italic>; see Harner 1984:168–169). The inheritance of an
                        <italic>arútam wakán′</italic>, however, was far from
                    guaranteed (see Mader 1999 for a more
                    comprehensive analysis of Shuar discourse about power as constantly circulating
                    and transforming).<sup>31</sup>

                <p>Anthropologists usually explore the intersubjective element of visionary
                    knowledge through accounts of shamans (e.g., Buchillet 1992; Hill 1992;
                    Kracke 1992; Townsley 1993), where a visionary transaction with
                    a spirit empowers a normally benevolent transaction between the shaman and
                    another human in the ordinary world. Since shamans typically talk about their
                    visions with their patients, they are usually good informants on visionary
                    knowledge. The <italic>arútam</italic> vision of the Shuar
                        <italic>kakáram</italic> is in many ways the structural opposite, in
                    which a transaction with a spirit in the vision-world empowers one to kill other
                        humans.<sup>32</sup> Despite the
                    decline in warfare, even today, <italic>kakarma</italic> (power) is for many
                    Shuar a tangible quality. But <italic>kakáram</italic>s do not readily
                    talk about their visions.</p>
                <p>Elke Mader, who conducted research among the Shuar in 1990, 1991, and 1994,
                    confirms Harner’s account of a two-part vision (Mader 1999:246; see also Harner 1984:138–139). She argues that power
                    is transmitted through the words of the anthropomorphic
                        <italic>arútam</italic> (Mader 1999:244–246). She provides a symbolic analysis of typical
                    elements of the <italic>arútam</italic> encounter (pp. 227–230) and
                    demonstrates convincingly the parallels between the imagery in
                    individuals’ accounts of visions and the imagery in the popular Shuar myth
                    of the cave of the <italic>tayos</italic> (oilbirds [<italic>Steatornis
                        caripensis</italic>]; pp. 249–270). She argues that there is a
                    detailed discourse linking Shuar visions, myths, and rituals concerning the
                    transmission of powers and Shuar feuding and warfare.</p>
                <p>Mader provides the most detailed and insightful account of Shuar symbolism. Her
                    analysis relies not only on her own interviews but also on accounts collected by
                    the missionary Siro Pellizzaro and the research of several Shuar students. While
                    the raw material of this discourse is undoubtedly Shuar, I am concerned that the
                    fact that this material has entered discourse is to some degree the
                    accomplishment of missionaries and their Shuar students, that is, part of the
                    transformation in Shuar history from power based on visions to power based on
                    writing. But even granting that a Shuar discourse about power existed before
                    missionization, all ethnographic accounts of the Shuar make clear that some
                    elements of visions enter discourse only under specific circumstances; my
                    informants suggest that there is some element of visions that may not enter
                    discourse at all. This essay is meant to complement Mader’s work by
                    focusing on those elements that resist entry into discourse or that enter
                    discourse only in distorted form.</p>
                <p>None of my informants would speak to me of the details of their encounter with
                    their <italic>arútam</italic>, but they all spoke of the feeling of
                    strength and purpose that it gave them, qualities that stayed with them as long
                    as they possessed the <italic>arútam</italic>. Taylor provides a
                    different, though equally significant, account of the beliefs of the Achuar.
                    Noting that the <italic>arútam</italic> is essential to the personality
                    of an “outstanding human-being,” she remarks that her informants do
                    not speak of the <italic>arútam</italic> transmitting any
                    “energy” or “force” (as occurs in other Amazonian
                    societies) to the seeker. She then asks, what exactly is
                            conferred?<disp-quote>
                  <p>The Jivaroan emphasis on the heightened sense
                            of self-consciousness and purpose, instead of that of strength or
                            vitality as such, seems to point to a different interpretation, which is
                            that the <italic>arutam</italic> serve as an <italic>existential
                                amplifier</italic>; it gives not just life, but, more importantly,
                            life with direction or quality, life linked to a certain set of values.
                            (Taylor 1993:666)</p>
               </disp-quote>Although there are some notable
                    differences between Shuar and Achuar (the Shuar receives and absorbs the
                        <italic>arútam</italic> itself), the emphasis on a heightened sense
                    of self, of self-possession, is shared. What is it about visions that leads
                    Shuar to view them as sources of power?</p>
                <p>To understand these other elements, I wish to reflect on a double tension within
                    these practices. One is the straightforward way in which the heightened sense of
                    one’s own self and vitality is directed toward the extermination of the
                    life of another self (boys too young to participate actively in a raid would
                    accompany their fathers on raids; Harner 1984:139). The other is the conjunction of speech and silence:
                            <disp-quote>
                  <p>Most of his relatives and acquaintances shortly know that
                            he has acquired an <italic>arutam</italic> soul simply because of the
                            change in his personality. For example, he especially tends to speak
                            with great forcefulness. However, he must not tell anyone that he has
                            acquired such a soul, or it will desert him. (Harner 1984:139)<sup>33</sup>
                  </p>
               </disp-quote>Aside from prowess
                    at killing, combined with invincibility, the principle diagnostic of a
                        <italic>kakáram</italic> is the ability to speak clearly and
                    effectively. This ability is exemplified in autobiographical narratives, which,
                    according to Taylor (2007:148), are
                    “in fact the only kind of discourse in which experience of the past is
                    given collective shape” (see also Hendricks 1993).</p>
                <p>Yet one of the most important events in the person’s life is kept out of
                    this autobiography. Mader reports that there are conditions under which Shuar
                    speak of their visions, but my informants have revealed to me only those visions
                    that “have already come true.” It is easy to misunderstand a Shuar
                    who says that his or her vision was true as likening the vision to a prediction.
                    Given Shuar views of the ordinary world, it makes more sense to liken the
                    relationship between the envisioned future and the future in this world to the
                    relationship between the <italic>uwishín</italic>’s nonmaterial but
                    real <italic>tsentsak</italic> and the material <italic>tsentsak</italic> that
                    is its mimetic manifestation. It is not really that the vision “came
                    true”; rather, it is that the Shuar came to experience the material
                    manifestation of the vision. Thus, Shuar talk of their visions is not in my view
                    a violation of secrecy. In effect, to say that a vision has come true is simply
                    to say that others have seen it; it is thus their vision too. The vision entered
                    the social on its own, as it were.</p>
                <p>According to Harner, during the visions the <italic>wakán′</italic>
                    informs the seeker of his fate and then enters the seeker’s body. We could
                    say that the vision enters the seeker’s body; through the body, the vision
                    enters the world, and the seeker meets his destiny (see Lacan 1988:159). This complex is so important,
                    Taylor concluded, that “Jivaroan culture as tradition is not an
                    objectified body of knowledge or set of explicitly held representations, nor is
                    it concentrated in material things or institutions; it is primarily the means of
                    achieving a certain kind of selfhood” (Taylor 2007:151). Put another way, then, what is it about the
                    encounter with the <italic>arútam</italic> that produces this kind of
                    selfhood?</p>

        </sec>
        <sec id="sc3">
            <title>Shuar Culture through the Looking Glass</title>
            <p>I think that the answer has something to do with the way in which the plant-granted
                vision is <italic>not</italic> like a mirror. Very few Shuar before the founding of
                the Federation, and no Shuar before European colonization, had a mirror. Adults
                could use language to describe one another or fill a gourd with water to create a
                reflective surface. But while there are many puddles in a rain forest, they are
                usually muddy and can barely reflect shadows. There may be some rivers and the
                occasional oxbow lake that run still enough to reflect an image back, but Shuar
                seldom pause before them, and the baby swaddled and slung behind a parent or, more
                likely, older sister has virtually no opportunity to see its reflection.</p>
            <p>What if it was not “the specular image,” as Lacan suggested, that was for
                Shuar infants “the threshold of the visible world” (Lacan 2006 [1949]:77) but something else? I propose
                that Shuar babies did go through “the Imaginary” but did not go through
                the mirror stage. I suggest that the first image a Shuar was given of itself as he
                or she became self-aware was not the deceptive image of wholeness that bourgeois
                children get from mirrors.</p>
            <p>In place of a mirror, I speculate that the Shuar Imaginary had a basis that is as
                material and objective as the mirror in bourgeois society but quite different in
                nature: the images that they encountered were those given to them by
                    <italic>tsentsemp</italic>, <italic>tsáank</italic>, and
                    <italic>maíkua</italic>.<sup>34</sup> Just as a mirror disrupts the visual plane against which
                it is set (for example, creating the illusion of depth when flat on a wall), visions
                disrupt any consciousness of a continuous reality. While each person’s vision
                was subjective, this realm of the “Imaginary” had an objectivity for
                Shuar because it was based on the ingestion of plants; plants constituted the
                external and shared point of reference for all power-granting visions. Most
                importantly, the vision did not present the child with an image of itself; it was
                the medium for an encounter with another subject.<sup>35</sup>
         </p>
            <p>Mader provides a detailed analysis of the part of visions that Shuar recount in words
                and that thus draws on and enters into discourse. While I value her analysis, I do
                not believe that it is sufficient to explain the power that Shuar gain through the
                vision. In my conversations with Shuar there is a surplus power, a feeling of power
                that goes beyond the <italic>wakán′</italic>’s account of the
                future. As Harner and Mader have both pointed out, the communication of knowledge
                about the future is only one part of the encounter between a person and an
                    <italic>arútam wakán′</italic>. Both emphasize that a
                crucial part of this encounter is the incorporation of the <italic>arútam
                    wakán′</italic>, or some of its power, into the person. This Shuar
                belief is similar to Lacan’s point that encounters with others not only
                influence one’s self-image but also actually constitute the ego, that is, a
                part of one’s self. It is this intersubjective mutual recognition in the
                plant-granted vision that, for Shuar, establishes “the symbolic matrix in
                which the <italic>I</italic> is precipitated in a primordial form, prior to being
                objectified in the dialectic of identification with the other, and before language
                restores to it, in the universal, its function as subject” (Lacan 2006 [1949]:76).</p>
            <p>Descola calls attention to this dimension of the self in his conversations with
                Achuar concerning kinds of <italic>arútam</italic>.<sup>36</sup> Descola’s careful analysis of
                    <italic>anent</italic> (a very specific register that I discuss at greater
                length below) meant to summon an <italic>arútam</italic> makes it clear that
                it is the formation or transformation of a new kind of subjectivity that is the
                essential source of power:<disp-quote>
               <p>Of particular significance, finally, is the
                        exclamation, “As I wait in expectation, let him carry me off
                            [<italic>jurukuta</italic>], as I wait in expectation, let him rearrange
                        me [<italic>iwiaitkuta</italic>]”: the effect of
                            <italic>arutam</italic> is revealed here in two complementary
                        modalities. The first evokes the adoption of a child and thus suggests the
                        creation of a new social identity; the second indicates a metamorphosis in
                        the course of which the supplicant discovers himself to be endowed with new
                        characteristics. This is confirmed by Tunki who, in answer to the question
                        “How does <italic>arutam</italic> act upon the visionary?”
                        replied “<italic>Arutam</italic> reorganizes
                            [<italic>iwiaitkawi</italic>] the personality: it becomes a new
                        personality.” (Descola 1996:309)</p>
            </disp-quote>What is the relationship between the
                verbal and nonverbal parts of the vision?</p>
            <p>Here, I believe, anthropologists may benefit from Lacan’s methodological
                arguments against his fellow psychoanalysts. Most simply put, Lacan felt that his
                colleagues depended unquestioningly on language to access dynamics that resisted
                entry into language: early-childhood experiences and the unconscious. He believed
                that the discourse created by the analyst and the analysand disguised and distorted
                precisely those elements of the analysands’ experiences and desires that
                needed analysis. Similarly, Mader’s analysis of the verbal part of the vision
                gives us insight into how adults comprehend their encounter with an
                    <italic>arútam</italic>. Typical of most adult experiences, it is, of
                course, mediated by language. And as Mader’s analysis demonstrates, it of
                course gives us further insight into Shuar discourse. But this is only one dimension
                of personhood.</p>
            <p>How, though, might we understand the portion of the vision that cannot be
                    verbalized?<sup>37</sup> How can we
                understand the significance of the plant-granted visions of preverbal Shuar
                children? Here I believe that an anthropology of the ineffable can learn from
                Lacan’s psychoanalysis of the ineffable (Lee 1990:33–34). For Lacan, the point of entry into an understanding
                of bourgeois subjectivity was the mirror. I believe that for Shuar the point of
                entry is the plant-granted vision. My method is to reflect on the ways plant-granted
                visions are and are not like mirror images. This is a speculative exercise, but it
                helps us look at other aspects of Shuar culture in new and interesting ways.</p>
            <p>My argument is simple and thus brief. Shuar recognize that the Symbolic—the
                order constituted through language—is a realm of misrecognition and impossible
                desires (see Basso 1987 for an analysis of
                language as a realm of deception and illusion among the Brazilian Kalapalo). We can
                thus use Lacan’s analysis of the Symbolic to infer what occurs in the Shuar
                vision. If speech is the realm of misrecognition, then for Shuar their visions are a
                realm of true recognition, the true recognition <italic>of</italic>, and
                consequently (and most importantly) <italic>by</italic>, an Other. In their earliest
                visions, I propose, babies encounters images of the Real—an experience that
                reinforces their experience of reality as Real. In later visions, the child
                encounters a nonhuman from which it experiences a pure and truthful recognition, a
                kind of recognition not possible from other human beings (which has implications for
                Shuar attitudes toward sociality that I explore below).</p>
            <p>Like Lacan’s mirror-visionary, the Shuar visionary-Imaginary is built up and
                modified through a person’s life. However, whereas Lacan’s Imaginary
                begins with a literal mirror and is built up through metaphorical mirroring, the
                Shuar Imaginary begins with a plant-granted vision and is built up through more
                plant-granted visions, as Shuar would repeat the search for an
                    <italic>arútam</italic> many times in the course of their lives. I do not
                question that Shuar also experience metaphorical mirroring, that is, the reception
                of an image of one’s self through the actions and reactions of another. I
                point out only that Shuar insist on a clear distinction between the encounters they
                have with other beings in the real world of the plant-granted vision and the
                encounters they have with other beings in the deceptive world of everyday relations.
                (Put another way, for Lacan the ego exists in the Imaginary register. For Shuar, no
                ego is real <italic>in this world</italic>. For Lacan, the subject is split. For
                Shuar, the “me” and the “I” are allies in a way that
                contrasts strongly with their roles in Lacan’s patients.)</p>
            <p>For Lacan, the Real, the Imaginary, and the Symbolic may coexist as distinct
                registers in the life of an adult, but we have direct access to the Real only as
                preverbal infants. Shuar adults, however, can always have another direct encounter
                with the Real through a plant-granted vision and new encounter with an
                    <italic>arútam</italic>. It is for this reason, I posit, that
                Harner’s (1984:134) informants told
                him that the normal world is a lie, but the world of the
                    <italic>arútam</italic> is real. The effect of the vision’s
                disruption of ordinary “reality,” one might say, is to reverse the
                semiotician’s point that symbols are the arbitrary signifiers of objects:
                visions reveal that there is something arbitrary about the objects of the mundane
                world (to suggest a reformulation of the quote from Harner [1984:135], at the beginning of “Power/Knowledge”).<sup>38</sup>
         </p>
            <p>The visionary-Imaginary thus involves a <italic>béance</italic> for Shuar, as
                for the bourgeois analyzed by Lacan. The Shuar <italic>béance</italic>,
                however, takes different forms and functions: a gulf between the Imaginary and the
                Symbolic (i.e., between vision and speech) and, as Harner put it, between the false
                normal world and the true hidden world. Put another way, for Lacan the Imaginary
                effects a split in the subject; for Shuar, it effects a split in the world.</p>
            <p>But there is no reason to believe that, as was the case for Lacan’s analysands,
                who he supposed had all passed through the mirror stage, Shuar identify the
                visionary-Imaginary in terms of a gap between the body as dependent fragments and
                the body as autonomous whole. The earliest visions that occur after the Shuar child
                enters the Symbolic reflect knowledge of its split or alienated subjectivity, but
                one that contrasts sharply with that of the bourgeois subject. The principal divide
                that the Shuar encounters <italic>within</italic> the visionary-Imaginary is not the
                distinction between the Shuar and his self-image, his “me”; it is
                between the Shuar and the <italic>arútam</italic>. There is in this drama a
                kind of alienated subjectivity, but the relationship between the Shuar and the
                    <italic>arútam</italic> is one not of identification but of attachment.
                As long as the <italic>arútam</italic> is partnered with the Shuar, it is a
                source of overwhelming power.</p>
            <p>As Shuar typically suggest, in the visions that occur as they grow older, there is
                some kind of symbolic communication that, coming from a nonhuman, Shuar take to be
                accurate in the ordinary sense of the word. Perhaps these revelations of the
                seeker’s future are the noncorporeal analogue of that nonsymbolic portion of
                the <italic>arútam</italic> that is incorporated into the seeker’s
                body. This experience enables Shuar to articulate another difference internal to the
                subject, between the Shuar who ingests the plant-granting vision and the Shuar who
                is “rearranged” and augmented by the <italic>arútam</italic>. But
                this second subject is neither the ego in Lacan’s sense of self-image nor
                Freud’s “ego-ideal” against which the Shuar may judge himself (and
                fall short)—it is the “me” transformed into the “I”
                who will return to the ordinary world and a life of action. In other words, the one
                thing visions have in common with the mirror stage is what Lacan identified as the
                truth of the mirror stage: not what one is, but what one will become.</p>
            <p>Shuar make clear that central to the visionary recognition is a recognition of what
                one will become. In contrast to bourgeois children, for Shuar the experience of the
                    <italic>béance</italic> is exhilarating and literally empowering. The
                Shuar visionary-Imaginary is the inverse of Lacan’s mirror stage: power and
                independence signified by the fragmented and metamorphosing images of Others issued
                forth from the plant (not the wholeness reflected by the mirror). I propose that
                this “visionary-Imaginary” constitutes “another Other,” that
                is to say, another realm that can, as it were, <italic>stand up</italic> to
                    language.<sup>39</sup>
         </p>
            <p>I am <italic>not</italic> arguing that Shuar did not go through Lacan’s
                Imaginary. Shuar children entered into the Symbolic, interacted with other children
                and adults, and surely formed self-images through these encounters. I am, however,
                proposing that Shuar had and continue to have access to <italic>another</italic>
                Imaginary, one mediated through visions and constituted through relations not with
                other egos (“me’s”) but with other I’s, that is, the
                    <italic>arútam</italic>s. Shuar could thus have a subjectivity that
                avoids or even resolves psychological problems caused by the ego.</p>
            <p>More to the point, the visionary-Imaginary and the Symbolic had functions for Shuar
                fundamentally different from those of the Lacanian Imaginary and Symbolic in
                bourgeois society. In both, the Imaginary mediates a relationship between the Real
                and the Symbolic. In bourgeois society, I suggest, it is the terrain in which the
                Symbolic colonizes the Real. Conversely, I suspect that through visions, Shuar
                created a space in which the Real could colonize the Symbolic.</p>
            <p>One way it did so was through seemingly endless cycles of feuding and warfare that
                repeatedly squeezed, almost to the point of closure, the cycle of life and death.
                For Lacan, during the Imaginary a ruptured identity manifests itself in jealousy
                verging on paranoia; frustration with the impossibility of being the internalized
                Other explains childish aggressiveness (Grosz 1990:41–42). For those who view the mirror stage metaphorically
                (with Mommy playing the mirror), this phase ends with the resolution of the Oedipus
                complex (Grosz 1990:42–43). Shuar,
                however, continued to have literal visions into adulthood, resulting in a desire to
                kill that was not enclosed by the Oedipal triangle but rather channeled through
                extensive kinship networks that organized blood feuds and war-party alliances.</p>
            <p>Another way the Real colonized the Symbolic was through practices (described below)
                that disallowed speech or distorted it beyond recognition. Put another way, by
                punctuating their speech with certain silences and by distorting speech beyond
                recognition during encounters with others or attempts to conjure up visions for
                others, Shuar mimicked aspects of their encounter with an
                    <italic>arútam</italic> and thus extruded a bit of the Real into
                    reality.<sup>40</sup>
         </p>
            <p>Visions, however, enable a Shuar to speak truthfully. It is not that a vision reveals
                a particular truth about which the Shuar may speak; it is rather that the possession
                of an <italic>arútam</italic> manifests itself in the person’s ability
                to see and speak about the world clearly. The Shuar term for this quality is
                    <italic>paan chicham</italic> (clear speech), which Shuar believe may overlap
                with, but be different from, <italic>penker chicham</italic> (good speech). An
                anthropologist taking a performative approach to language can say that individual
                Shuar manipulate speech and use it strategically to manipulate others with more or
                less skill and that the most skillful are considered
                    <italic>kakárams</italic>. Shuar, however, believe that a
                    <italic>kakáram</italic> is sincere and transparent. It is as if it is
                the authentic quality of the vision that enters into the
                    <italic>kakáram</italic>’s speech.</p>
            <p>Above, I called attention to the mimetic relationship between the material and
                nonmaterial <italic>tsentsak</italic>s of the <italic>uwishín</italic>. It
                seems to me that the relationship between the <italic>paan chicham</italic> and the
                    <italic>arútam wakán′</italic> of the
                    <italic>kakáram</italic> is analogous. <italic>Paan chicham</italic> is
                mimetic of the <italic>arútam</italic> in its power and truthfulness. This
                leads to an irony, if not a paradox, in that the <italic>kakáram</italic>
                does not speak clearly about his visions.</p>
            <p>This paradox is resolved on the eve of a raid, which occasions the principal
                exception to the taboo on speaking of one’s visions. Warriors took turns
                revealing to one another the identity of their respective
                    <italic>arútams</italic> (for Shuar, these often turn out to be legendary
                ancestors such as Shakai and Nunkui). The ultimate proof that one possesses an
                    <italic>arútam</italic> is that one could speak its name—one had
                the knowledge and also the sincerity and honesty. To prove that one has an
                    <italic>arútam</italic>, one must give it up.<sup>41</sup>
         </p>
            <p>It was through this paradox, I suggest, rather than the kinds of neuroses Lacan
                treated, that Shuar paid the price for their divided subjectivity. The split
                effected by the identification with and incorporation of the
                    <italic>arútam</italic> enacted being’s embracing of its becoming.
                The only threat that this arrangement presented to Shuar was the possibility of the
                loss of the <italic>arútam</italic>. Yet even this loss Shuar managed to make
                their own by deliberately disowning their <italic>arútam</italic> on the eve
                of a raid, by violating its secrecy and naming it among the other warriors. This
                negation of becoming was simultaneously its realization.</p>
            <p>As soon as the warrior pronounced the name of his <italic>arútam</italic>, it
                departed his body; in effect, on the eve of killing, the warrior committed a form of
                spiritual suicide (Harner 1984:140). I think
                that it is highly significant that this occurred at the threshold of death, as the
                warrior would either have killed or have been killed before the next night fell.
                Freud grappled with this dependence of life on death in his various writings about
                the death instinct. In light of Shuar beliefs, Lacan’s account makes more
                        sense:<disp-quote>
               <p>The death instinct essentially express[es] the limit of
                        the historical function of the subject. This limit is death—not as an
                        eventual coming-to-term of the life of the individual, not as the empirical
                        certainty of the subject, but, as Heidegger’s formula puts it, as that
                        “possibility which is one’s ownmost, unconditional,
                        unsupersedable, certain and as such indeterminable
                        (unüberholbare),” for the subject. (Lacan 2006 [1953]:262)</p>
            </disp-quote>This practice is
                evocative of Lacan’s understanding of the aim of psychoanalysis: for the
                analysand to be able to speak his or her own story (to speak as an “I”
                rather than as a “me”), the analysand must recognize life’s
                dependence on death:<sup>42</sup>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>The events of a subject’s life
                        come to have meaning only through their relationship to a future point in
                        that life that is somehow essential and revelatory of meaning. …
                        Death is such an essential and revelatory future moment, not because it is a
                        nonarbitrary end point of life, but because it is the one part of the
                        subject’s life that cannot be taken away from the subject: one’s
                        death is unavoidably one’s own. (Lee 1990:92)</p>
            </disp-quote>When one is born into a social world
                often governed by convention and taught to express one’s feelings and desires
                in a language shared and shaped by countless others, one’s death is not just
                the end of one’s becoming, it is most purely one’s own. In speaking of
                and thus losing one’s <italic>arútam</italic>, one spoke this
                truth.</p>
            <p>The vision entered the space of language and left the <italic>kakáram</italic>
                behind. It left the “I” behind, alone to confront its ego, its
                “me.” Perhaps battle was as much a contest between the “I”
                and the “me” as it was between two warriors: the next day, a man could
                say either “I killed him” or “he killed me.”<sup>43</sup> The Shuar subject thus entered
                life on its own as the warrior entered the space of death (one might say that in
                order to kill, the warrior must first be able to die). The murder of another the
                next day may thus be considered a kind of rebirth (which, at some point, will be
                followed by another trip to a waterfall, to take <italic>maíkua</italic>
                again, and encounter another <italic>arútam</italic>).<sup>44</sup>
         </p>
            <p>The warrior was vulnerable not only in the face of his enemies but also in the face
                of his allies. Shuar social life offered very few occasions for large-scale
                collective action. A war party was one of the few occasions for many men from
                several clusters to work together. A successful party required a solidarity that
                often rested on a weak foundation, especially as it was quite possible for members
                of the same party ordinarily to be enemies. One could easily take advantage of the
                conditions of the raid to kill the other (Harner 1984:185). Revealing the identity of one’s
                    <italic>arútam</italic> on the eve of a raid was one way to heighten the
                sense of shared purpose. Perhaps the fact that this act had the effect of expelling
                one’s own <italic>arútam</italic>—of exposing one’s self
                among one’s fellow warriors—further heightened the sense of solidarity.
                The destruction of a social group was thus preceded by the creation, however fragile
                and ephemeral, of one of the largest social groups to which a Shuar man might ever
                belong.</p>
            <p>Shuar warriors gave up their <italic>arútams</italic> in return for a brief
                period of social solidarity. In the next section of this essay, I describe certain
                practices that illustrate the fraught nature of Shuar sociality that would have made
                such moments so precious. These practices involved ritual uses of speech, the
                principal means by which power intruded into the social.</p>

            <title>Language and the Space of Death</title>
            <p>As in Lacanian theory, Shuar seemed to inhabit a Symbolic register that is defined by
                violence and vulnerability. Lacanian thought provides a useful point of reference
                for comparing bourgeois culture and Shuar culture, in that it directs our attention
                to the relationship between the Symbolic and violence. But, I argue, the terms and
                operation of this relationship are strikingly different in these two cultures. In
                bourgeois societies, the name of the father (represented by the phallus) displaces
                one’s power over the Symbolic; symbolic castration—the loss of
                one’s phallus—is the price one pays for entering society.<sup>45</sup> In Shuar culture, on the other
                hand, it was through the actual gain of an <italic>arútam</italic> that one
                entered society; individuals gained mastery over speech through their encounter with
                an unnamed <italic>arútam</italic>. These individuals <italic>chose</italic>
                the moment of loss—not of the Symbolic but of their kernel of the
                Real—by speaking the name of the <italic>arútam</italic> before
                entering the space of death.</p>
            <p>As feminist theorist Kaja Silverman pointed out, an important way to begin situating
                Lacan’s analysis historically and culturally (and thus moving away from the
                suggestion that the value of Lacanian thought depends on the universal validity of
                his claims) is by distinguishing between his concepts of “the law of
                language” and “the law of kinship structure.” Following the work
                of Claude Lévi-Strauss (1951, 1969) and Gayle Rubin (1975), she argues that according to the former, the incest
                taboo between child and parent, central to bourgeois culture, leads to an erotic
                displacement that maps relations among father, mother, and child. According to the
                latter, the incest taboo between brother and sister, central to nonstate societies,
                leads to the circulation of women, alliances between brothers and brothers-in-law,
                and the organization of families into larger social units (Silverman 1992:35–42; see also
                Lévi-Strauss 1969).<sup>46</sup>
         </p>
            <p>As Silverman (1992:37) points out, there is
                no necessity for the circulation of women. Among the Shuar, who were matrilocal, one
                could, for example, say that men circulated. Of course, one could say that
                Lévi-Strauss’s point about the use of women to forge alliances among
                men held, but the circulation of men in Shuar society had important consequences. It
                was used to forge alliances between a senior warrior and his sons-in-law (not
                brothers-in-law). This had two important consequences. First, it functioned to build
                up the power of senior warriors (see also Turner 1979). If institutionalized, this could, one might suppose, have led to
                the development of the state. But the second consequence was that when the senior
                warrior died, there was no longer any bond holding the sons-in-law together. They
                dispersed to form their own networks of allies. In Shuar society, kinship did not
                build up larger social units; it broke them down.<sup>47</sup>
         </p>
            <p>The senior warrior and his sons-in-law formed an independent social group, but they
                were not autonomous; they belonged to multiple, overlapping networks of allies.
                According to older ethnographies, Shuar socialized a great deal. Nevertheless,
                Harner describes a life that was insecure and at times lonely. The problem, as I
                have argued through this essay, is not a failure of social solidarity but rather the
                undependability of networks and, at a more profound level, the lack of
                trustworthiness in recognition, in the truth value of recognition. The
                “Symbolic” as a space of death signals the perpetually troubled
                relationship Shuar have with both language and other Shuar. Whereas the Shuar
                visionary-Imaginary is constituted through the recognition of an impossible other,
                the Shuar Symbolic is, I suggest, constituted through, and constitutes, the
                dangerous—in many cases impossible—realm in which people encounter
                ordinary others. In this section, I explore the Symbolic as a space of death, first
                in childhood relationships and then in adult interactions and relationships.</p>

                <p>The “Symbolic” as a space of death signals the perpetually troubled
                    relationship Shuar have with both language and other Shuar. Whereas the Shuar
                    visionary-Imaginary is constituted through the recognition of an impossible
                    other, the Shuar Symbolic is, I suggest, constituted through, and constitutes,
                    the dangerous—in many cases impossible—realm in which people
                    encounter ordinary others.</p>
                <p>To understand this, I turn to a different tradition in psychoanalytic theory that
                    has addressed intersubjective recognition. According to Jessica Benjamin, the
                    tension between a desire to dominate and a desire to be dominated is a challenge
                    all children must confront in their socialization. This is because infants are
                    fully dependent on older caregivers, especially their mothers, but at around the
                    age of 14 months they begin to become capable of some independence. For
                    Benjamin, the move toward independence is not purely a move toward separation
                    and autonomy. Ironically, in order to achieve independence, the child has a new
                    need: the need to be recognized (by its mother, among others) as independent. As
                    the growing child explores its world with increasing volition, it tests the
                    boundaries that surround it. There is the risk that a child can become, in
                    effect, a sadist, asserting itself at the expense of others; there is also the
                    risk that the child will prolong its dependence on its mother, in effect playing
                    the masochist, surrendering its own boundaries (Benjamin 1988:52–53).</p>
                <p>Benjamin’s language concerning recognition suggests the influence of
                    object-relations theorists such as D. W. Winnicott, who first called attention
                    to metaphorical “mirroring” as a form of recognition.<sup>48</sup> As I read her, however, she is
                    not concerned so much with “recognition” as with the ways a
                    subject’s power depends on its recurring encounters with resistances. What
                    is important is not the mother “mirroring” back an image of the
                    infant but rather the mother and child’s struggle to assert their own
                    agency without obliterating the other. This “dialectic of control”
                    identifies a challenge in childhood socialization that persists through
                    adulthood.</p>
                <p>Benjamin is working within psychoanalytic terms and thus within the Oedipal
                    triangle (that is to say, a triangle organized by desire and threatened or
                    repressed violence) of the bourgeois nuclear family. Among Shuar, this triangle
                    is ruptured in at least two notable ways. In the world of the vision, it is
                    through the intervention of the <italic>arútam</italic> and the dynamics
                    of recognition of which we cannot speak; in the world of speech, it is through
                    the intervention of a personal, bilateral kindred that extends far beyond the
                    walls of the natal home and thus the history of violence (not Freud’s
                    hypothesized castration anxiety but the threat of actual murder) and alliances
                    that canalize this network. I believe that familiar narratives of blood feuds
                    are a means through which the domination drama between parent and child
                    described by Benjamin is doubly displaced. First, any tension between parent and
                    child is displaced by enmity toward others. Second and just as important,
                    domination is displaced by actual violence.</p>
                <p>Shuar culture is characterized by both a will to power and a rejection of
                    authority. Domination, as Benjamin insists, is a kind of social relationship.
                    The obliteration of another—the termination of any possibility for a
                    social relationship—is the expression of power without domination. This
                    may also explain why Shuar beliefs developed so as to encourage repeating the
                    quest for a visionary encounter with an <italic>arútam</italic>: such
                    visions, building on infantile visions that predated the entry into the
                    Symbolic, provided a space where a Shuar, if he dominated his own fears, could
                    have a social (i.e., intersubjective) interaction with a nonhuman, an
                    interaction free of the complex and perilous negotiations between two
                    humans.</p>

                <title>Dangerous Dialogues</title>
                <p>My reflections on the importance of intersubjective encounters in Shuar visions
                    and the ways they contrast with intersubjective encounters among Shuar stand
                    apart from much research among other Amazonian peoples. There has been a great
                    deal of research recently on “conviviality” in Amazonian societies,
                    what Joanna Overing and Alan Passes described as the “aesthetics of
                    community” (Overing and Passes 2000<italic>c</italic>:xi; see also Overing and Passes 2000<italic>a</italic>). They called
                    attention not only to how individual agency and sociality were mutually
                    constitutive but also to the importance of the affective (as opposed to the
                    purely structural) in this process (Overing and Passes 2000<italic>b</italic>:14).</p>
                <p>In an ethnography of the Piro of the Peruvian Amazon, Peter Gow noted that when
                    people believe that all kin “should live well together,” it follows
                    that kin who live apart are those with whom one cannot live well (Gow 2001:122). Gow’s comment occurs in
                    the middle of an analysis of elaborate greeting rituals that occur when Piro of
                    one village visit another; one could describe his account as a negative
                    dialectic of conviviality. Given their pre-Federation settlement pattern and
                    that Shuar even today consider the matrilocal homestead the basic unit of social
                    life, one could say that they provide the extreme case of Gow’s principle:
                    people do not get along with those with whom they do not live. In
                    Hendricks’s account (1993:146),
                    Shuar revalue this negation as something positive: “I was told that the
                    ‘traditional’ Shuar man was the one who separated himself from
                    others and lived a quiet life avoiding conflict.”</p>
                <p>Shuar are highly social, but because households are dispersed, socializing often
                    requires long-range visits (Harner 1984:105–111; Karsten 1935:245; Stirling 1938:96–99). The apparent contradiction between bellicosity and
                    sociality leads to another important feature of Shuar culture: dialogic
                    discourse (on ceremonial dialogues in native South America, see Urban 1986; see also Crépeau 1993; Erikson 2000; Surrallés 2003). As noted above, Shuar speech is an indicator of
                    power—not because speech is a medium of domination (since no Shuar could
                    give orders to another; Hendricks 1993:7) but because a skilled orator is taken to possess an
                        <italic>arútam</italic>. Much of Shuar speech is structured around
                    explicit calls for recognition, and in certain cases recognition must be
                    carefully negotiated, lest one man be given cause to kill another. Ritual
                    dialogues are both necessary and highly risky activities.</p>
                <p>Brief descriptions of two major kinds of ceremonial dialogues will establish the
                    basic principles. According to Hendricks, the most important pre-Federation
                    speech form was the <italic>enémak</italic>, “war speech”
                    (Hendricks 1993:86). This began with the
                    approach to and entry into a house: a visitor first announced his presence from
                    a distance, with a call; at the entrance of the house, brandishing a shotgun or
                    lance, he declared, “<italic>Winiájai</italic> [I am
                    coming].” At that moment, the host jumped up, brandishing his own shotgun
                    or lance, and began questioning the visitor to establish who he was and the
                    purpose of his journey. The dialogue consisted of stereotypic phrases,
                    contracted to two to four syllables and shouted as the two men stepped forward
                    and backward; the entire exchange could take up to 15 minutes (Karsten 1935:283–285). When large war
                    parties assembled, the men formed two lines facing one another to perform the
                        <italic>enémak</italic> collectively. If two strangers chanced upon
                    one another on a trail, they also performed the <italic>enémak</italic>
                    to establish their relationship and intentions.</p>
                <p>The other major form of ceremonial dialogue was (and in many places, still is)
                    the <italic>aujsatin</italic>, or visiting speech. As with the
                        <italic>enémak</italic>, this began with the approach to and entry
                    into a house: a visitor first announced his presence from a distance, with a
                    call; at the entrance of the house, brandishing a shotgun or lance, he declared,
                        “<italic>Winiájai</italic> [I am coming].” The visitor
                    remained, as it were, in a state of suspended
                    animation—“coming”—until the host responded,
                        “<italic>Winitia</italic> [You may come].” According to Karsten,
                    this period could be prolonged until the guest and host had both seated
                    themselves, the host had arranged himself, and a woman of the household had
                    served manioc beer. Once the host had formally acknowledged the guest, the guest
                    would shout for 5 or 10 minutes—the nature of his journey, news from home,
                    and if he was a stranger, to identify who he was, where he was from, and how the
                    two men were related (if they were) and to affirm friendship and support. During
                    this speech the host periodically shouted back an appropriate term of
                    recognition (“yes,” “true,” “quite so,”
                    “no,” “I don’t know”). When the visitor finished,
                    the host reciprocated with his own speech (Karsten 1935:245–247; Stirling 1938:96–99).</p>
                <p>As Janet Hendricks writes, these exchanges “provide participants with an
                    opportunity to display personal power, aggressivity, knowledge and skill, while
                    at the same time preventing open conflict by acknowledging the power of
                    one’s opponent” (Hendricks 1993:87–88). “Acknowledgment” is also a key
                    function of the semantically limited, but essential, declarations listeners make
                    while listening to a speech. Robert Crépeau has argued that in situations
                    where social solidarity is weak, Achuar visiting speeches, empty of content,
                    have a phatic function in demonstrating mutual respect of the rules for social
                    interaction and communication (Crépeau 1993:93). I add that in a culture where “the effective use of
                    language is considered to be a decisive factor in a man’s success in
                    social and economic activities” (Hendricks 1993:86), the use of speech to acknowledge the speech, the
                    presence, and the very existence of others is equally important. What speech is,
                    in effect, acknowledging is the presence of a person with an
                        <italic>arútam</italic>. That power, which the Shuar recognizes in
                    the silent realm of the vision, is acknowledged by other Shuar in the realm of
                        speech.<sup>49</sup> Significantly, it
                    is through gesture and voice, but not words, that men perform mutual
                    dominance.</p>
                <p>But these speeches are not entirely void of content, and they have immediate
                    communicative functions. Shuar children are brought up in a world where their
                    families are involved in a variety of blood feuds, and whenever two men meet,
                    they must discover immediately the nature of their relationship to assess
                    whether they are friend or foe. During an <italic>enémak</italic>
                    exchange on a path, for example, two men have a very short period of time to
                    determine whether, through kinship relations, they are ancestral enemies. A man
                    who is highly knowledgeable about his networks of kin and who wishes to avoid a
                    conflict can identify himself in such a way as to assure amicability. Otherwise,
                    one will kill the other. The same holds true when one visits another’s
                    house: “Failure to manipulate kin classification successfully can result
                    in the visitor’s food or beer being poisoned or in his being ambushed by
                    the host after he leaves the house” (Harner 1984:103). In the realm of speech, the wrong kind of
                    recognition means death.</p>

                <p>One might infer that the dispersed settlement pattern puts extra pressure on
                    intrahousehold relations. Yet Karsten, Stirling, and Harner observed that
                    domestic relations between men and women and between adults and children are for
                    the most part characterized by liberty and harmony. There is, however, an
                    interesting record of unfulfilled desires and hurt or angry feelings. These
                    enter language, but in a way that further illustrates a profound ambivalence
                    toward language: <italic>anent</italic>. An <italic>anent</italic>, I suggest,
                    is the closest speech can come to the visionary-Imaginary—and it does so
                    in a form virtually unintelligible to other people.</p>
                <p>
               <italic>Anent</italic> are highly formalized statements that typically portray a
                    desired situation. Shuar (like the Aguaruna and Achuar) believe that they were
                    composed by legendary heroes in a mythic past (although <italic>anent</italic>
                    often include Spanish words that sometimes describe objects of recent invention,
                    such as “airplanes, jukeboxes, ink, books, and so forth”; Taylor and
                    Chau 1983:99). Men and women have their
                    own <italic>anent</italic>, which they share only with people of the same sex.
                    Close kin may pass on their <italic>anent</italic> to others; one may also seek
                    to purchase <italic>anent</italic> from an elder. Among the Aguaruna, one can
                    learn an <italic>anent</italic> only with the aid of
                        <italic>tsáank</italic> that has been chewed by the elder. Once one
                    has memorized the <italic>anent</italic>, one must abstain from sexual relations
                    and consuming certain foods for several days (Brown 1986:72, 168).</p>
                <p>“<italic>Anen</italic> are not characterized by directive speech. Few
                    commands are to be found in them. Instead they consist primarily of descriptive
                    statements about the singer or the future state of things” (Brown 1986:168). Nevertheless,
                        <italic>anent</italic> are not referential, that is, they are not used to
                    communicate information; they are performative: they are believed “to have
                    a direct effect on the course of events” (Taylor and Chau 1983:92). They are usually addressed to
                    the productive activities of a household, such as hunting and cultivation, and
                    harmonious relationships among people related through marriage, especially
                    husbands and wives and brothers-in-law (Taylor and Chau 1983:94). Michael Brown concluded,<disp-quote>
                  <p>The
                            manipulative quality of <italic>anen</italic> shares much in common with
                            the power of visions. Both are constituted by evocative imagery that
                            illuminates a desired future state. Consumption of psychotropic
                            substances figures in the performance of <italic>anen</italic> and the
                            search for visions. Although both are essentially private experiences,
                            they place the actor in direct contact with ancient sources of
                            knowledge, thus projecting past and present into the future. Visions and
                                <italic>anen</italic> are attributed a palpable quality that
                            distinguishes them from other phenomena: they are both reified, referred
                            to as “things” that have a life of their own. This
                            reification underscores the degree to which the performer of an
                                <italic>anen</italic> sees himself as engaging in a real operational
                            procedure rather than as performing a purely symbolic act. (Brown 1986:169–170)</p>
               </disp-quote>
               <italic>Anent</italic> are not
                    speeches about visions; they are speeches that function in many ways
                        <italic>like</italic> visions. The singer of an <italic>anent</italic>, I
                    propose, is seeking to communicate a vision to another Shuar (this is why it is
                    essential that <italic>anent</italic> are believed to have been authored by
                    mythic heroes like Nunkui and Shakai, for these are the
                        <italic>arútam</italic> that are the sources of visions). We could
                    then view the words of the <italic>anent</italic> to be not like a prayer (or
                    plea), an exhortation to the earth, or an animal, or one’s spouse, but
                    rather the iconic representation of a vision to be.</p>
                <p>Critically, these speeches are removed by Shuar as much as possible from the
                    realm of social discourse. <italic>Anent</italic> are secret; some people refuse
                    to reveal their <italic>anent</italic> to an ethnographer; others are willing to
                    produce in speech what they termed “imitations” of their
                        <italic>anent</italic> (Brown 1986:187). The language of <italic>anent</italic> is heavily distorted:
                    some syllables are repeated, others are contracted, parts of suffixes are
                    dropped or changed, and in some cases new suffixes, which have no semantic value
                    but affect the rhythm of the <italic>anent</italic>, are added (Taylor and Chau
                        1983:97). These changes often
                    render one person’s <italic>anent</italic> unintelligible to others
                    (Taylor and Chau 1983:99; Brown 1986:31). Most importantly,
                        <italic>anent</italic> must be sung (an <italic>anent</italic> that is not
                    sung is only an “imitation” of an <italic>anent</italic>, and not a
                    real <italic>anent</italic>). Taylor and Chau (1983:95) argue that “song” is not a native category;
                    what we call singing “is a meta-linguistic device used … to signal
                    the ‘otherness’ of the language one is speaking.”
                        <italic>Anent</italic> are sung alone, or, if in the company of intimates,
                    sung sotto voce. Sometimes, an <italic>anent</italic> is merely played on a
                    musical instrument (Taylor and Chau 1983:94).</p>
                <p>Taylor and Chau (1983:96) call attention
                    to the similarities between <italic>anent</italic> and shamanic chants (see also
                    Buchillet 1992, on the power of the
                    inaudible in Desana healing rituals, and Hill 1992, on the instrumentality of music in Wakuéni healing
                    rituals; Townsley 1993 provides a
                    detailed analysis of the combination of chanting and “twisted
                    language” in Yaminahua healing rituals). “Song,” they suggest,
                    is the language of the <italic>pasuk</italic> (a shaman’s familiar; i.e.,
                    an assistant that in the real world of visions often takes the form of an
                    animal) and <italic>tsentsak</italic>. I believe that the relationship between
                    the words and the melody of the <italic>anent</italic> is analogous to that
                    between the material and the nonmaterial <italic>tsentsak</italic>, or dart,
                    used by shamans. With both <italic>anent</italic> and <italic>tsentsak</italic>,
                    I believe, one may say that Shuar use a material but ineffective analogue for an
                    immaterial (or unspoken) but effective instrument. I suggest that the material
                    (or spoken) analogue is a technique for bridging the distance between the
                    ordinary world and the invisible “true” world.</p>
                <p>Perhaps song is the language of the <italic>arútam
                        wakán′</italic> (or “<italic>arútam</italic>
                    soul”)—this would explain why an <italic>anent</italic> played on a
                    musical instrument has force but the words of an <italic>anent</italic> spoken
                    without music are considered an imitation. The dilemma for Shuar is that words
                    constitute the language of human beings; in the words of the
                        <italic>anent</italic>, Shuar turn language against itself. The language
                    that warriors use to communicate to one another the identity of their
                        <italic>arútam</italic> has the effect of driving their
                        <italic>arútam</italic> away. Perhaps by making language
                    unrecognizable to other humans, Shuar hope to create in their solitary or soft
                    chanting of <italic>anent</italic> a space in the mundane world where the truth
                    of the imagination may abide. In their solitude, what they imagine most is
                    productivity and the companionship of others.</p>

            <title>Reflections of | on the Subject</title>
            <p>What is at stake in this article is how we talk about the difference between state
                and nonstate societies. It is not surprising that this is hard to talk about. Pierre
                Clastres (1989) began his provocative
                    <italic>Society against the State</italic> (originally published in 1974;
                English translation published in 1989) by asking whether it is possible for us to
                talk about such peoples—“primitive” or “archaic”
                societies, including Amerindians, especially in Amazonia—without having to
                characterize them in terms of a lack of the institutions of coercion and
                subordination that we take for granted, in other words, as “stateless”
                societies. He suggested that rather than trying to understand such societies as
                lacking in power, we need to try to understand them as standing against a certain
                kind of power, namely, the “command-obedience” relationship. The rest of
                his essay consists of his reflections on what kind of power can be antithetical to
                the command-obedience relationship we so take for granted.</p>
            <p>Clastres argued that all power hinges on a relationship between speech and violence
                and that state societies (in which command-obedience is considered acceptable or
                even normal) are characterized by the conjunction of the two (as Weber [1978:54] put it, “the
                    <italic>legitimate</italic> use of physical force”; emphasis in the
                original) and that nonstate societies employ a variety of strategies for keeping the
                two dimensions of power separate. In an intellectual tradition that perhaps includes
                Hobbes as well as Rousseau, Clastres believes that there are always people who are
                tempted to conjoin the two or that people may be aware of a desire within themselves
                to do so. “The State” exists not only as potentate but also as
                potentiality: as an idea, or the glimmer of an idea, somewhere in the mind (see
                Abrams 1988). Consequently, the performance
                of the practices that keep speech and violence separate constitutes a “history
                of their struggle <italic>against</italic> the State” (Clastres 1989:218; emphasis added).</p>
            <p>The Shuar add to Clastres’ examples another, and important, kind of history of
                a people’s struggle against the State. Among the Shuar, speech and violence
                are conjoined in the person of the <italic>kakáram</italic>: the search for
                the power of voice and the search for the power of physical violence are one and the
                same. Nevertheless, their pre-Federation social organization cannot be understood in
                terms of the command-obedience relationship, and it could hardly be characterized as
                a state. Given that the head of each household could aspire to be a
                    <italic>kakáram</italic>, that the typical
                    <italic>kakáram</italic> could generally rely consistently only on the
                support of his sons-in-law, that each cluster of allied households formed a
                politically and economically autonomous unit, and that these units typically
                dispersed when the elder <italic>kakáram</italic> died, one might
                characterize the history of the pre-Federation Shuar as a people’s struggle
                against Society.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, I think that Clastres is right to call attention to the relationship
                between speech and violence. His analysis, however, lacks a theory of the subject,
                and I think that the interplay between speech (or discourse, or the Symbolic) and
                violence in the constitution of “the subject” is essential for a full
                understanding of the difference between the state and societies against the state.
                What I am attempting to do in this essay is to add to Clastres’ analysis of
                political practices in egalitarian society an analysis of the formation of
                “the subject” in one egalitarian society.<sup>50</sup>
         </p>
            <p>I end this essay with some reflections on the relationship between different kinds of
                subjects and different configurations of speech and violence.<sup>51</sup> I find psychoanalytic theory as provocative a
                set of reflections on the “subject” in bourgeois states as I find
                Clastres’ reflections on “power” in nonstate societies. In both
                kinds of societies, there is some kind of problem with “the subject,”
                but the problems (and hence, the subjects) are different. Lacan’s mirror stage
                is an encounter with the self that one can never become; Shuar visions involve an
                encounter with an other that no other human can be.<sup>52</sup> Language and the limits of language are key to both,
                and an adequate understanding of the subject requires a reconsideration of the
                Symbolic.</p>
            <p>In keeping with much psychoanalytic theory, the Lacanian subject is the desiring
                subject, desire signifies a lack, and desire is constituted through the Symbolic.
                Philosopher Gilles Deleuze and psychoanalyst Félix Guattari have argued that
                this is a bourgeois view. While they employ Lacan’s distinction between the
                Real, the Imaginary, and the Symbolic, they explicitly treat desire as a presence.
                They argue that humans are born into a social world organized by flows between
                different organs of different people and things and that desires produce these flows
                (Deleuze and Guattari 1983:1–2,
                    46–48).<sup>53</sup> In
                noncapitalist societies, flows are coded, regulating specific flows between specific
                organs on specific occasions, and people are territorialized, meaning that flows
                among them are local (pp. 139–153). As various kinship systems and their
                political and economic, as well as social, functions illustrate, mothers, fathers,
                brothers, and sisters are never just mothers, fathers, brothers, and
                sisters—they always have other functions.<sup>54</sup>
         </p>
            <p>The Clastrian question is, what kinds of desire organize speech and violence in ways
                that frustrate or serve the command-obedience relationship? For Shuar, I have
                argued, it is an augmentation of the person—specifically, the attachment of
                the power of the <italic>arútam</italic> through a plant-granted vision
                (rather than the mirror stage or castration anxiety)—that creates the desiring
                subject. This subject desires, above all else, not pleasure but power.<sup>55</sup> Shuar experience this desire not
                as a lack but as a surplus of speech and a desire to kill.</p>
            <p>Although speech and violence are combined in the <italic>kakáram</italic>,
                they are functionally separate in that the threat of violence is never used to
                support the use of speech to command. Arguably, high levels of violence, or the
                threat of violence, promoted a dispersed settlement pattern among Shuar that
                undermined any attempt to institutionalize alliances among large numbers of
                    <italic>kakárams</italic> under the leadership of one. Moreover, the
                desire to kill constitutes a kind of power that can never take the form of a
                command-obedience relationship: the only thing a <italic>kakáram</italic>
                wishes of potential victims is to kill them, not to command them. Speech and
                violence connect most directly not through a command but through the naming of
                one’s <italic>arútam</italic> on the eve of a raid. And it is this
                act—an autonomous act—that detaches the
                <italic>arútam</italic>-power from the
                <italic>kakáram</italic>’s body. It is the separation of the vision and
                speech, the violation of which initiates the separation of the
                    <italic>arútam</italic> from the body, then—rather than the
                separation of speech and violence per se (see Clastres 1989:152–155)—that distinguishes Shuar politics. I
                also take this to mean that the Shuar subject is essentially fragmented (albeit in a
                way that is fundamentally distinct from Freud’s bourgeois subject).</p>

                <p>I conclude with an account of the bourgeois subject, because I think that this
                    kind of subjectivity helps explain why Shuar, who successfully resisted the Inka
                    and the Spaniards, were so quickly and peacefully subjugated by the modern
                    state. In this account, I rely heavily on the work of various critical
                        theorists.<sup>56</sup> Deleuze and
                    Guattari argue that the workings of class domination are better understood
                    through an analysis of desire than through interests (1983:257). Deleuze and Guattari, philosopher Slavoj
                    Žižek, and Kaja Silverman have forwarded very compelling, and
                    complex, analyses of what Silverman (1992:2) calls the “libidinal politics” of capitalism by
                    bringing Marxian and Freudian thought into engagement. I cannot hope to do
                    justice to their arguments, but this conclusion is heavily indebted to their
                    work.</p>
                <p>Political theory, which not only is a set of theories about states and their
                    subjects but also is produced by the subjects of states, largely concerns itself
                    with classifying different kinds of states, analyzing the different rights and
                    duties of the sovereign and its subjects, and evaluating the relative strengths
                    and weaknesses of different kinds of states. For political anthropologists, the
                    existence of nonstate (or egalitarian) societies highlights certain seemingly
                    universal features of states: the command-obedience relation that Clastres
                    emphasizes and the class stratification that Morton Fried (1967) emphasizes. As Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels (1971 [1848]) famously remarked, the
                    history of all such societies is a history of class conflict. In these theories,
                    the state is fundamentally opposed to human freedom.</p>
                <p>The Enlightenment project was to theorize a new kind of order that would
                    guarantee the freedom to choose one’s way of life (i.e., a system in which
                    the sense of subject as actor would displace or determine the sense of subject
                    as acted upon or spoken for). Proponents of the liberal state<sup>57</sup> and of capitalism (i.e., the bourgeois
                    state) claim that these systems have either achieved this goal or are the best
                    means available to achieve it. As one of the central objectives of indigenous
                    political movements, to seek the recognition from the state (and thus enjoy the
                    rights of its subjects), entails recognizing the legitimacy of the state,
                    indigenous peoples must care about the truth of this claim. The struggles of the
                    Shuar Federation for legal recognition suggest that the Shuar accept this
                    claim.</p>
                <p>Žižek’s work is of value not only because it provides an
                    important critique of this claim but also because the very critique helps
                    explain why Shuar would nevertheless find the bourgeois project appealing. As I
                    read him, the great paradox of capitalism is not that it promises freedom while
                    delivering inequality but rather that it does so in a way that convinces people
                    that the solution to problems caused by capitalism is more capitalism. The key
                    lies in the means through which the bourgeois subject is produced. According to
                    critical theorists, the bourgeois subject came into being historically through
                    the rise of the labor contract, which first emerged in Europe in the fourteenth
                    century and became the dominant and paradigmatic relationship with the
                    industrial revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (see also the
                    work of conservative legal historian Henry Maine [1946 (1861)]). According to Marx (1976 [1867]:668), the creation of capitalism—the
                    transformation of money and other commodities into
                    “capital”—begins with an act of mutual
                            recognition:<disp-quote>
                  <p>Two very different kinds of
                            commodity-possessors must come face to face and into contact: on the one
                            hand, the owners of money, means of production, means of subsistence,
                            who are eager to increase the sum of values they possess, by buying
                            other people’s labour-power; on the other hand, free labourers,
                            the sellers of their own labour-power, and therefore the sellers of
                                labour.<sup>58</sup>
                  </p>
               </disp-quote>These new workers were free in the
                    sense that they were not part of the means of production (like slaves and serfs)
                    and in the sense that they were “free from, unencumbered by, any means of
                    production of their own” (Marx 1976
                        [1867]:668; see also pp. 165–166). The relationship between the
                    capitalist and the worker was thus, it seems, predicated on the mutual
                    recognition of two free and equal actors. This may have been the case in the
                    fourteenth century, when feudalism was collapsing but before capitalism was
                    institutionalized. Former serfs undoubtedly and very reasonably considered the
                    labor contract to be a major improvement over their former condition. By the
                    time of the Industrial Revolution, however, the dependence of workers on wage
                    labor was anything but a victory.<sup>59</sup>
            </p>
                <p>This kind of contract developed before actual bourgeois states, and it provided
                    the basis for the “social-contract theories” that have been used to
                    legitimize the bourgeois state.<sup>60</sup> According to these theories, the basis of this kind of
                    state is not the command-obedience relationship around which feudal society
                    revolved but the contract entered into among free and equal people. In turn,
                    this kind of state enacted laws that supported and enforced the wage-labor
                    contract while exacerbating economic and political inequalities among its
                    subjects.</p>
                <p>The Marxist critique of capitalism is that the encounter between capitalist and
                    worker in fact involves a misrecognition that itself is predicated on and
                    perpetuates more profound misrecognitions. The fundamental misrecognition is
                    that the capitalist and the worker are equal, or free in the same way. (As
                    Silverman [1992:7] notes, in Lacanian
                    thought the Imaginary and Symbolic identifications are “mutually
                    coercive.” Perhaps this explains why the mirror is so important in
                    bourgeois society, not just as a play object for parents and their babies but to
                    the point that most people look at themselves in a mirror not only when they
                    awake but also shortly before going to bed. The image it reflects—that
                    one’s opposite is one’s equal—supports the fiction of the
                    labor contract, that the worker and the capitalist, while formally opposites,
                    are nevertheless equal.)</p>
                <p>That capitalists own the means of production has a series of important
                    consequences. For example, British political economists such as Thomas Malthus
                    and David Ricardo argued that as long as the supply of workers is greater than
                    the demand, workers will need capitalists more than capitalists need workers,
                    wages will be lower than profits, and capitalists will, on average, be wealthier
                    than workers (see Marx 1976 [1867]:689,
                    720).</p>
                <p>According to Žižek, however, this is but the material consequence
                    of another kind of misrecognition: that the freedom of the worker is a form of
                    freedom. “This freedom is the very opposite of effective freedom: by
                    selling his labor ‘freely,’ the worker <italic>loses</italic> his
                    freedom—the real content of this free act of sale is the worker’s
                    enslavement to capital” (Žižek 1989:22). Thus, for Žižek, the wage-labor
                    contract undoes the entire Enlightenment contract.</p>
                <p>However, as Žižek points out, this is because this contract is
                    premised on yet another kind of misrecognition: that labor power can be a
                    commodity like any other. Marx (following the political economists of his day)
                    argued that labor is unique in that it is labor that transforms everything else
                    into some useful product (Marx 1976
                        [1867]:53; see also Kołakowski 2005:227–228). “The crucial point not to be
                    missed here,” Žižek (1989:22) insists, “is that this negation is strictly
                        <italic>internal</italic> to equivalent exchange.” In formal terms,
                    the exchange of labor power for a wage is entirely fair; the price set by the
                    abstract forces of supply and demand, it is the act of exchange that by
                    definition establishes the equivalence between a quantity of money and a
                    quantity of the worker’s time. The “catch,” as he puts it, is
                    that the commodity sold by the worker, labor power, can be used by the
                    capitalist to produce other commodities that are worth more than the wages paid
                    for the labor power. The process of capitalist production thus produces
                    something new (something that would not come into existence, e.g., with the
                    exchange of bread for meat, in Smith’s famous example), what Marx termed
                    “surplus-value.” It is this surplus value that Marx believed to be
                    the real source of wealth in capitalism, being reinvested in new technologies
                    that have enabled capitalism to grow into a global system.</p>
                <p>In capitalism, not only is labor viewed like any other commodity but the meaning
                    of labor (as a producer of all other values) is also displaced onto a different
                    commodity: money (see Žižek 1989:24). This is because money can buy anything; Marx does not
                    consider this an essential property of money but rather one that attaches to
                    money only when it comes to be used to purchase labor power. Unlike feudal
                    lords, capitalists invest a portion of their wealth in developing new markets
                    and new technologies, thus creating ever more commodities that one might
                    purchase with money and thus making money <italic>seem</italic> not only more
                    desirable but also more productive and powerful. Marx calls this last
                    misrecognition “commodity fetishism” because people believe that
                    money—whether an inert object mined by humans (e.g., silver and gold) or
                    printed by humans (e.g., paper money) or just an idea, today represented
                    electronically—is talked about as if it were alive and had the power to
                    reproduce, like real living things.<sup>61</sup>
            </p>
                <p>Now the point is not that people literally believe that money is alive (an
                    equally important part of my socialization [see n. 61] was my mom—no
                    capitalist, but a believer in savings banks—repeatedly insisting that
                    “money doesn’t grow on trees”). According to
                    Žižek (1989:30–33),
                    the power of ideology is not that people believe in an illusion (e.g., that
                    money can grow) but that people <italic>acknowledge</italic> the reality but
                        <italic>live</italic> as if things were not so. This is evident when the
                    state response to failing banks is to lend banks money and the response to a
                    credit-default crisis is to encourage people to borrow more money.</p>
                <p>The critical question is, what keeps people believing things they do not
                    “literally” believe? According to Marx, the working class was first
                    produced from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries through state violence,
                    which compelled ever-growing numbers of people to sell their labor power. But
                    subjects of the bourgeois state must be produced anew in every generation,
                        <italic>before</italic> entering the labor market (and without the constant
                    and immediate use of violence).<sup>62</sup> What kind of cultural and psychological work has to
                    occur to sustain this series of misrecognitions? Critical theorists argue that
                    this kind of subject—the subject ready and willing to enter into the
                    wage-labor contract—is produced through the bourgeois family.<sup>63</sup>
            </p>
                <p>According to bourgeois ideology, the household is the proper place for sex and
                    the production of children. Freud’s insight was that independent of
                    whatever virtues parents consciously seek to instill in their children, it is
                    the very structure of the household, the way that it triangulates desires, that
                    produces “the subject.” Although Freud was relatively uninterested
                    in capitalism, Deleuze and Guattari and Žižek find in
                    psychoanalytic theory the link between the kind of subject produced by the
                    bourgeois family and the kind of subject who will experience the labor contract
                    as the foundation of freedom.</p>
                <p>According to Deleuze and Guattari, when capital becomes productive and money
                    becomes the primary way through which social relations are ordered, the formerly
                    coded “flows” that connected people and objects in highly specific
                    ways become “decoded.” Crude examples of such decoding include the
                    beliefs that “everything has a price,” that people will do anything
                    if offered enough money, and, more commonly, that “my money is as good as
                    anyone else’s” (i.e., money does not care whether someone is high-
                    or low-born, cultivated or uncultivated).</p>
                <p>To all appearances, the bourgeois family is clearly set off from this uncoded
                    world: “There ensues a privatization of the family according to which the
                    family ceases to give its social form to economic reproduction: it is as though
                    disinvested, placed outside the [social] field” (Deleuze and Guattari
                        1983:263). Within the privatized
                    family, mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters are, or appear to be, simply
                    themselves. In fact, they provide the interior limit to the utter decoding of
                    all flows. The Oedipal triangle of “mommy-daddy-me” sets the stage
                    for castration dramas through which desire comes to be experienced not as
                    productive but as a lack. “We are all little colonies and it is Oedipus
                    that colonizes us” (Deleuze and Guattari 1983:265).</p>
                <p>Whereas Freud used the language of myth to understand this process (thus
                    identifying one family’s personal drama as archetypical of all families),
                    Lacan seeks instead to describe an abstract structure common to such families.
                    He thus explains desire-as-lack by describing the subject, the “I,”
                    not as an identity but as a position within this structure. Specifically, it is
                    a location situated between two registers that are alien to one’s self:
                    the Real (which, by definition, has not yet entered and perhaps can never enter
                    into the Symbolic and is thus unavailable to one’s consciousness) and the
                    Symbolic (the entire cultural world that exists through the words and deeds of
                    others but is introduced to the subject, and is for Lacan signified, by
                    “the name of the father”). One may think of this location as empty,
                    but Lacan’s argument is that it is precisely this empty location that
                    defines the subject.</p>
                <p>Put another way, the subject is constituted through lack: it is what is neither
                    Real nor Symbolic. This lack defines the subject as a desiring subject.
                    According to Lacan, there is always some portion of the Real that cannot enter
                    into the Symbolic and that anchors this lack. But one can desire only what one
                    can imagine. For example, at first this desire may simply be for milk. As the
                    child grows and develops an image of herself as a person, as a desiring subject,
                    she will realize that her mother is not just a source of milk but is another
                    desiring subject, and the girl may come to desire her mother—or, more
                    precisely, to desire being desired by one’s mother. And she will discover
                    that her mother has other desires. The child’s desire will turn toward
                    other objects, drawn from a repertoire of objects available in her culture. But
                    none will ever satisfy her. None of them can. No object taken from that
                    “Other” that is the Symbolic can ever fill the lack that exists
                    because of that “Other” that is the Real.<sup>64</sup>
            </p>
                <p>That portion of the Real that is cut off from one’s self is, according to
                    Lacan, what Freud meant (in the terms of his Oedipal myth) by
                    “castration.” Put another way, some portion of the Real that cannot
                    be symbolized is what is “left over” (<italic>reste</italic>) from
                    the process of symbolization. Lacan refers to this “left-over” as
                    surplus—specifically a surplus pleasure (<italic>plus-de-jouir</italic>),
                    meaning a pleasure that one cannot use. Lacan also calls this
                        <italic>jouissance</italic> (a pun on <italic>jouis-sense</italic>,
                    “enjoyment-in-sense” or “enjoy-meant”). A simple example
                    of this may be the pleasure some people experience when shopping, especially
                    upon entering a supermarket or department store where one is surrounded by
                    objects that one cannot purchase in fact but <italic>could</italic> purchase in
                    fantasy (when I was growing up, this image was a common sign of the superiority
                    of capitalism over communism in popular American culture; in the film
                        <italic>Moscow on the Hudson</italic>, the overwhelming—i.e.,
                    “surplus”—bounty of a supermarket causes the protagonist, a
                    Soviet defector, to faint). Žižek refers to this surplus pleasure
                    as a “hard kernel” of the Real that exerts an obscure and
                    uncontrollable force on society. All societies must find some way to channel
                    this force, but most cannot. It is thus fundamentally destabilizing.</p>
                <p>In capitalism, however, the lack that defines the desiring subject is masked by
                    the lack created when one sells off one’s own labor power, which one must
                    do if one lacks ownership of the means of production (Žižek 1989:49). But in bourgeois ideology,
                    purchasing commodities can fill this lack, so above all things people desire
                    money (indeed, equating it with freedom)—and therefore are willing to work
                    for wages.<sup>65</sup> Heiko Feldner and
                    Fabio Vighi (2010:2) summarize
                    Žižek’s argument thus: “Capitalist ideology functions
                    by surreptitiously converting <italic>jouissance</italic> into value—into
                    something which is valorised and exchanged.” For Žižek,
                        <italic>jouissance</italic> is a “hard kernel” of the Real, a
                    signifier of trauma (the castration effected by the Symbolic) that constitutes a
                    problem in every society. He suggests that capitalism is so durable because it
                    provides (through the exchange of alienated labor power for fetishized
                    commodities) a salve for the wound of castration.</p>
                <p>This model of the subject depends on two elements: first, a distinction between
                    the registers of the Real and the Symbolic and second, the use of
                    “phallus” and “castration” as signifiers of desire and
                    lack. I find the first element useful in analyzing Shuar culture but not the
                    second. For this reason, I find the work of Deleuze and Guattari especially
                    useful. For them, “castration” is neither privileged nor the
                    privileged signifier of the Symbolic. It is the effect of culturally specific
                    processes. As I understand them, it is capitalism, through the bourgeois family
                    and specifically the Oedipal drama, that produces this traumatic wound that
                    transforms desire into a lack that can never be filled.<sup>66</sup> As I read them, it is the Oedipalizing
                    family that solves a problem in the capitalist mode of production.</p>
                <p>I consider Deleuze and Guattari’s historicization of the Oedipal complex
                    and castration anxiety a significant advance that helps us better understand the
                    difference between bourgeois societies and societies like that of the Shuar.
                    According to them, castration anxiety cannot simply be interpreted as the
                    experience of desire as a lack. It is also the mark of a relocation of violence
                    in the production of the subject. Here we see the value of a theory of the
                    subject for Clastres’ model: it identifies another kind of violence
                    (psychic rather than political, in the strict sense) on which the
                    command-obedience structure of the bourgeois state depends.</p>
                <p>For Deleuze and Guattari, one of the pivotal case studies manifesting
                    Freud’s complicity with this Oedipal colonialism is “A Child is
                    Being Beaten” (Freud 1955 [1919]),
                    which describes a fantasy, often accompanied by masturbation, that an indefinite
                    number of children of undetermined sex are being beaten by someone (Deleuze and
                    Guattari 1983:61). According to
                    Freud’s patients, this fantasy involves a series of three displaced
                    identifications through which children work through their Oedipal dramas.<sup>67</sup> It begins with an
                    identification with the child being beaten and ends with an identification with
                    the father who is beating the child. Freud’s point is not that everyone is
                    a sadomasochist; rather, the dynamics of the Oedipal triangle makes it likely
                    that children will have both sadistic and masochistic fantasies as they
                    negotiate the passage from childhood to adulthood.</p>
                <p>As Deleuze and Guattari point out, none of Freud’s patients describes the
                    second fantasy. It is Freud’s construction, meant to help him make sense
                    of the relationship between the first and third fantasies (and how—within
                    the fantasy—boys and girls swap positions). Rather than take this as an
                    accurate account of some patients’ dreams, Deleuze and Guattari take it as
                    revealing a dynamic inherent in the Oedipal triangle: the internalization of
                    sadistic fantasies (when one identifies with the castrating father) and
                    masochistic fantasies (when one experiences violence as a substitute for, and
                    thus a form of, love). It thus exemplifies psychoanalytic theory’s place
                    in bourgeois ideology.</p>
                <p>This is a disturbing and provocative analysis, but I think that it fills an
                    important gap in Žižek’s analysis of capitalism because it
                    shows how pleasure (e.g., in constant shopping sprees) can also express a kind
                    of violence and how a violation (e.g., going to work) can be experienced as a
                    kind of pleasure. Castration may be a metaphor, but metaphors such as these are
                    played out through fantasies, repressed desires, or dreams, where the violence
                    one experiences is, at that moment, real. Cynics may say that the threat of
                    violence is always present in bourgeois societies, while the faithful believe
                    that democracy ensures the consent of the governed. The fact remains that
                    bourgeois states need subjects who do not require the constant and arbitrary
                    exercise of brute force to be obedient. Moreover, they need subjects who can
                    serve as agents of the violence of the state (a necessity if, as Weber stated,
                    the state is to have a monopoly on the legitimate use of force).</p>
                <p>For Deleuze and Guattari, the violence that is both symbolic and terrifying
                    exists in the dreams of children, and it is this combination of symbolism and
                    violence that produces bourgeois subjects:<disp-quote>
                  <p>Simultaneously the boys
                            are beaten-initiated by the teacher on the little girl’s erotic
                            stage (seeing machine), and obtain satisfaction in a masochistic fantasy
                            involving the mother (anal-machine). The result is that the boys are
                            able to see only by becoming little girls, and the girls cannot
                            experience the pleasure of punishment except by becoming little boys. It
                            is a whole chorus, a montage: back in the village after a raid in
                            Vietnam, in the presence of their weeping sisters, the filthy Marines
                            are beaten by their instructor, on whose knees the mommy is seated, and
                            they have orgasms for having been so evil, for having tortured so well.
                            It’s so bad, but also so good! (Deleuze and Guattari 1983:61)</p>
               </disp-quote>Perhaps
                    one must have read <italic>The Heart of Darkness</italic> (or have seen
                        <italic>Full Metal Jacket</italic>) and must remember the My Lai Massacre to
                    understand their point (our fantasies have the greatest force when they are
                    inexplicable, and they thrive when we forget our own history).</p>
                <p>The point, for this essay, is that bourgeois subjects do not make great warriors.
                    Even after going through training that is designed to desensitize and habituate
                    themselves to the act of killing, conscripts become generally reluctant killers.
                    What traumatized American soldiers the most during WWII was not the fear of
                    being killed: “<italic>Fear of killing, rather than fear of being killed,
                        was the most common cause of battle failure</italic>” (S. L. A.
                    Marshall, quoted in Silverman 1992:63,
                    emphasis in original)—this is the form in which subjects of the state
                    struggle against the state. When converted into an occupying force, bourgeois
                    soldiers often end up questioning their identity as civilized men and women.
                    Both situations cause tremendous stress. As this essay was being revised,
                        <italic>Time</italic> reported on the difficulties in “bringing relief
                    to thousands of damaged soldiers”: “Army troops, TIME has learned,
                    are seeking mental help more than 100,000 times a month. That figure reflects a
                    growth of more than 75% from the final months of 2006 to the final months of
                    ‘09, according to Army data” (Thompson 2010:22).</p>
                <p>What is remarkable in these accounts is not the terror of being shot at or being
                    a constant target but the trauma of being made a killer. I believe that this is
                    because—and in stark contrast to men in “societies against the
                    state,” such as the Shuar—these soldiers are not killing for their
                    own <italic>jouissance</italic>, but for the pleasure of their commanders, of
                    the state. By literally emasculating others, under the orders or in the
                    interests of the state, they are simultaneously enacting their own symbolic
                    emasculation.</p>

                    <p>“In a democratic order,” Žižek (1989:147) writes, “sovereignty
                        lies in the People.” There is one serious danger in such a situation:
                        “But what is the People if not, precisely, the collection of the
                            <italic>subjects</italic> of power?” This is how he analyzes the
                        totalitarian states that plagued the twentieth century, principally
                        Hitler’s Germany and Stalin’s Soviet Union. The ideology of
                        these regimes (and the fact that they, like many other dictatorships,
                        employed the device of elections) points to a fatal problem in
                        Rousseau’s theory of democracy: the concept of “the
                        People.” Žižek (1989:147) concludes that “the Lacanian definition of
                        democracy would then be: a socio-political order in which the People do not
                        exist—do not exist as a unity, embodied in their unique
                        representative.” What better way to characterize the pre-Federation
                        Shuar? What I have tried to demonstrate in this essay is how certain beliefs
                        about plant-granting visions play a central role in sustaining such a
                        society.</p>
                    <p>Žižek insists that entry into the Symbolic creates a
                        “hard kernel” of leftover or surplus Real that makes trouble for
                        every society except capitalist ones, where it is harnessed to
                        “solve” the very problems it creates through constant
                        revolutions (in the means of production). This occurs not only through the
                        intervention of the Symbolic as such but also through a specific symbolic
                        order based on the labor contract, through which the mutual recognition of
                        capitalist and worker is the means by which workers give up their labor
                        power to the capitalist. This produces surplus value, which is used to
                        produce the commodities that workers buy in an impossible attempt to fill
                        the void.</p>
                    <p>I propose that the Shuar have found their own solution to this problem, a
                        solution that can be expressed as the “mirror image” of
                        capitalism: the Shuar enter a particular kind of Imaginary based on
                        plant-granted visions, where the mutual recognition of the
                            <italic>arútam wakán′</italic> and the Shuar is the
                        means by which the vision gives up some portion of its power to be
                        incorporated into the individual Shuar. This produces a
                            <italic>jouissance</italic> that Shuar experience as a drive to kill, a
                        drive that I do not even try to understand and a kind of killer that I do
                        not think bears comparison to any kind produced in bourgeois society.</p>
                    <p>Here we see the value of a theory of the subject for Clastres’ model of
                        societies against the state. If, as Lacan suggested, all psychic economies
                        are threatened by a surplus of pleasure (<italic>jouissance</italic>), Shuar
                        managed this by giving up their share of the Real (when naming their
                            <italic>arútam</italic> and losing its force on the eve of a
                        raid) in return for the pleasure of killing (or trying to kill) another.
                        Shuar thus used <italic>jouissance</italic> to create a system without
                        internal limits. Whenever power threatened to concentrate within Shuar
                        society, feuding threatened to kill the most powerful men or send the most
                        powerful men into war, where they could be killed.</p>
                    <p>Violence was thus as central to pre-Federation society as it is to the state,
                        but in significantly different ways. For Shuar, the
                            <italic>arútam</italic> created a desire to kill, but in ways
                        that subvert the Symbolic. Power was derived not from a coordination of the
                        Imaginary and the Symbolic (whether it be “God” or “the
                        People”) but rather from a coordination of the Imaginary and the Real.
                        It was the intrusion of the Real into the individual’s Imaginary that
                        created the <italic>kakáram</italic>. Clear, truthful speech occurred
                        in the register of the Symbolic, but I believe that it should be understood
                        as an index of that “hard kernel” of the Real that for the
                            <italic>kakáram</italic> was not traumatic but a form of
                            <italic>jouissance</italic>. This <italic>jouissance</italic> perhaps
                        should be viewed not as surplus pleasure but as surplus power. This power
                        could never take the form of a command-obedience relationship: killing
                        someone makes it impossible to command them; death dissipates surplus power.
                        No state can form through this kind of violence.</p>
                    <p>Shuar visions involve a recognition that occurs in both the Real and the
                        Imaginary. This is not a break with the Real. On the contrary, some part of
                        the Real, in the form of the force of the <italic>arútam</italic>,
                        adheres to the Shuar subject. The ineffable plays such an important role in
                        Shuar power because it marks the intrusion of the Real into real life. There
                        were, no doubt, attempts to bring the Real directly into the Symbolic, but,
                        I propose, Shuar beliefs about visionary knowledge and power doomed such
                        attempts to failure. In Clastrean terms, the point at which speech and
                        violence actually met, with the speaking of the name of the
                            <italic>arútam</italic> on the eve of a raid for Shuar, was the
                        point where this excess of power dissipated (i.e., the
                            <italic>arútam</italic> departed the body). Violence and speech
                        were brought as close as possible, but the resulting discharge, the killing
                        of another, could be indexed by the reputation of the killer but not
                        transformed into an enduring command-obedience chain. No state can form
                        through this kind of speech.</p>

                    <p>Among anthropologists, Michael Taussig popularized the idea of the
                        “space of death” in his work on the inhabitants of Putumayo,
                        Colombia. As he described it, “The space of death is crucial to the
                        creation of meaning and consciousness, … We may think of the space of
                        death as a threshold, yet it is a wide space whose breadth offers positions
                        of advance as well as of extinction” (Taussig 1984:467). For Taussig, the space of death accurately
                        and precisely names the “room without a number” in which
                        dissident Argentine-Jewish newspaper publisher Jacobo Timerman was tortured
                        in 1977. Taussig is especially concerned with “cultures of
                        terror,” those spaces of death “based on and nourished by
                        silence and myth in which the fanatical stress on the mysterious side of the
                        mysterious flourishes by means of rumor and fantasy woven in a dense web of
                        magical realism” (Taussig 1984:469). This is the state where violence punches through
                        speech, perhaps, one might say, where the state reaches its outer limit
                        (perhaps most recently expressed for Americans in images from Abu
                        Ghraib).</p>
                    <p>In a way, this essay is my attempt to comprehend what the “space of
                        death” might have been like in a “society
                            <italic>against</italic> the state.” Before the founding of the
                        Federation, Shuar lived in a world in which “men sleep with their guns
                        at their sides, rarely go more than a few hundred yards from their houses
                        without weapons, and when visiting another family, expect their hostess to
                        sample the beer, before she serves it, to prove it is not poisoned”
                        (Harner 1984:186). I believe that
                        Taylor’s (1993:666) emphasis
                        on “existential ‘health’” and the “meaningful
                        life-course in accordance with the epic values typical of a warrior
                        culture” has an important critical function in contrasting the power
                        and freedom granted by the <italic>arútam</italic> vision with the
                        power and freedom granted by the wage-labor contract. But I am concerned
                        that it can be read to romanticize the conflict-ridden lives of Shuar.</p>
                    <p>Lacan understood that “<italic>thou art that</italic>” (where his
                        patients entered their own space of death) could not stand for a completed,
                        integrated, or fulfilled identity. It is reported that many of Lacan’s
                        patients could not understand this and that they often stormed out of his
                        analytic sessions in anger. Shuar exited the space of their visions not with
                        a desire to kill their <italic>arútam</italic> but with “a
                        tremendous desire to kill” <italic>somebody</italic> (Harner 1984:139). Whom one killed, exactly,
                        depended on the tricky terrain of language; the detailed accounts of
                        enmities learned from childhood, the ability to manipulate kinship
                        relations, the luck, good or ill, of whom one met on the path. This was a
                        world in which, no matter how powerful one was, one’s identity was
                        always subject to renegotiation. I suggest that the desire to kill, felt
                        after acquiring an <italic>arútam</italic>, was an index of a
                        Shuar’s awareness that power points toward the space of death and that
                        destiny is a state not of grace but of war (or, as Clastres might have put
                        it, that Hobbes’s state of war, an ongoing war against the leviathan,
                        is the only state of grace).</p>
                    <p>I have tried not to minimize the violence that, to be honest, still threads
                        through Shuar society. This violence, unleashed against several Spanish
                        towns in a series of uprisings between 1579 and 1599, resulted in the death
                        of most of the Spaniards and the abandonment of all but one of the towns
                        (whose survivors relocated). “In this manner, the territory of the
                        Jívaro was left free of Spanish presence [and] the Jivaroan-speaking
                        peoples succeeded in maintaining a high level of autonomy until well into
                        the twentieth century” (Santos-Granero 1992:215–220).<sup>68</sup>
               </p>
                    <p>Since Ecuadorians returned to settle the Amazonian region in the early
                        twentieth century, there have been no reports of organized violence by Shuar
                        against settlers.<sup>69</sup> This
                        “space of death,” however, is still an active presence among the
                        Aguaruna in Peru. As Shane Greene has noted, plant-granted visions are still
                        “the first step” toward becoming a
                            <italic>kakáram</italic> (Greene 2009:81). Bikut, the legendary hero whom many Aguaruna liken to
                        Jesus, Buddha, and Socrates, is the embodiment of the entry of the space of
                        death into the ordinary world. A young man who kept ingesting
                            <italic>maíkua</italic> (in Aguaruna, <italic>baikua</italic>)
                        “in search of more and more powerful visions,” at one point he
                        stood up and declared that he had been transformed into Bikut. “He was
                        consumed by aggression, so much that his family was forced to restrain him
                        in the house by tying him to his stool. Bikut’s baikua-induced
                        dementia was, however, also the source of a unique and unbeatable warrior
                        spirit” (Greene 2009:92). In
                        stark contrast to Socrates, who drank hemlock in order to die, Bikut drank
                            <italic>baikua</italic> in order to kill.</p>
                    <p>Greene opens his ethnography with a conversation between an elder warrior and
                        a bilingual teacher (who had founded one of the four oldest regional
                        indigenous organizations) over the difference between visionary knowledge
                        and textual knowledge. Perhaps because no single Aguaruna organization has
                        the legitimacy and hegemony of the Shuar Federation (and, as Greene points
                        out, there are more than a dozen different Aguaruna organizations), Aguaruna
                        warriors can still act as leaders at critical moments.<sup>70</sup> This was the case in 1979, when a group
                        of warriors waited in the forest while another group peacefully occupied the
                        unauthorized camp of film director Werner Herzog (the peaceful action
                        succeeded in ejecting Herzog and his crew from Aguaruna territory, but the
                        warriors later burned the camp as an outlet for their aggression [Greene
                            2009:186–187]). In January
                        2002, more than 100 warriors massed and attacked a community of settlers
                        from the Andes, leaving 15 colonists dead. Greene remarks that he could not
                        “even fathom the kind of violence that these Aguaruna men decided to
                        use” (Greene 2009:152). At one
                        point during my dissertation fieldwork, Euro-Ecuadorian settlers expressed
                        real fear of a violent Shuar uprising. That the violence of the
                            <italic>arútam</italic> can leave the vision to create in the
                        ordinary world such a space of death is indeed terrifying, but I suspect
                        that what makes this so unfathomable to Greene is that this potentiality is
                            <italic>not</italic> terrifying to warriors.</p>
                    <p>So I think that it is a mistake to characterize the Shuar space of death as a
                        culture of terror. Terror, I have concluded, belongs to the state because
                        states have an existential dependence on a belief in secure boundaries. But
                        the self-destruction of paranoid military dictatorships in post-Perón
                        (Isabel), post-Perón (Juan) Argentina was just one example of the
                        state at its limits. States sometimes reach their paranoid limit when they
                        enter into spaces where they see no other states to mirror back to them an
                        acceptable self-image. For Taussig, Joseph Conrad’s <italic>Heart of
                            Darkness</italic> is paradigmatic, but so are the Americas: “The
                        space of death is one of the crucial spaces where Indian, African, and white
                        gave birth to the New World” (Taussig 1984:468). Taussig’s study centers on the
                        rubber-gathering areas and stations along the Putumayo River between 1900
                        and 1912 and the survivors of that little holocaust. For colonialism marks a
                        frontier for societies against the state, too; it is where states come
                        face-to-face with their own nightmare.</p>
                    <p>In the Amazon, capitalist culture, in which people believe that their desires
                        are infinite and that money can buy anything (in other words, that people
                        will do <italic>anything</italic> for money, if offered enough of it),
                        encounters cultures in which desires are coded and canalized, where people
                        regularly feel free to ask for what they want of another and do as they
                        please. When the British Parliamentary Select Committee on Putumayo asked
                        Peruvian rubber magnate and politician Julio César Arana what he
                        meant when he said the Indians did not wish to be civilized and indeed were
                        cannibals, he replied, “What I mean by that is that they did not admit
                        of exchange, or anybody to do business with them—Whites, for
                        example” (quoted in Taussig 1984:482). Perhaps an encounter with this carefree lack of
                        desire fomented in Arana and others unmanageable anxieties about their own
                        excessive desires. The absence of Indian desire reveals that bourgeois
                        desire is a presence, after all.<sup>71</sup>
               </p>
                    <p>The province now called Morona Santiago illustrates a different colonialist
                        dynamic. It lacked rubber trees to exploit, and although people have long
                        suspected that there are oil deposits under Shuar territory, there was no
                        serious interest in exploring for and extracting it until recently. But
                        after the 1941 war, Shuar were suddenly located on the contested border with
                        Peru. Under these conditions, Ecuadorians did not rely on the exorbitant
                        violence of the rubber boom. It tried to use relatively peaceful means to
                        convert Shuar into bourgeois subjects. Put another way, instead of
                        mobilizing the state’s space of death to colonize natives, the state
                        relied on capitalism’s libidinal economy to colonize and pacify the
                        Shuar space of death.</p>
                    <p>Today, headhunting is illegal, and many Shuar prefer to rely on the Shuar
                        Federation or Ecuadorian courts, rather than feuding, to resolve conflicts.
                        But Shuar are paying a price for peace. One example is how the
                        “pacification” of the Shuar has turned out to mean the
                        appropriation of Shuar violence by the state, which has embraced an image of
                        Shuar as warriors. Thus, in the Cenepa War (1995–1996), special
                        brigades of Shuar soldiers named “Arútam” and
                        “Iwia” fought, not against Achuar, but against Peruvians.<sup>72</sup>
               </p>
                    <p>While Shuar violence has been subordinated to the directives of the state,
                        Shuar speech is being subordinated to authorized publications. The Shuar
                        Federation cares more about the recognition of the state than it does about
                        the recognition of <italic>arútams</italic>. In the process, it has
                        embraced an “ideology of dependence and hierarchical order [that is]
                        is in sharp contrast to the pre-Federation ideology of individual autonomy
                        and balance of power” (Hendricks 1988:224). The Federation thus realigns Shuar agency to promote
                        their incorporation into a class-stratified society. It claims to defend
                        Shuar culture, but through publishing books about Shuar myth and ritual
                        rather than through the quest for plant-granted visions or warfare. In this
                        context, it is not surprising that many Shuar talk openly about their
                        visions; they have been colonized by speech—not the speech of the
                            <italic>kakáram</italic>, but the speech of the literate (see
                        Hendricks 1988).</p>
                    <p>This move toward literacy began as the project of Salesian missionaries.
                        Elmer Miller (1970) called
                        attention to the way that Christian missionaries in South America were
                        subverting native belief in the power of visions as they revealed the power
                        of the written word. The Salesians have dedicated themselves to transcribing
                        Shuar myths and rituals, to enlisting young Shuar in this project, and to
                        using written accounts of Shuar beliefs and practices, including accounts of
                        visions, in their schools (see Boster 2003). But attempts to preserve indigenous culture through the
                        production of written texts may thus have unintended consequences. Descola
                        tells a moving story in which a Christian missionary, having committed the
                        words to paper, performed a flawless <italic>aujmatin</italic> (visiting
                        speech) before an Achuar <italic>kakáram</italic>. Rather than
                        feeling honored, or comforted to know of a new means for reproducing his
                        culture, the old man was saddened by the realization that writing-power had
                        made vision-power obsolete (Descola 1996:353–356).</p>
                    <p>Descola’s informant recognized the power of the priest because the
                        priest had succeeded in reproducing an Achuar ritual so accurately. I
                        suspect that priests convinced large numbers of Shuar and Achuar of the
                        authenticity of their claims to truth and power because they exhibited some
                        of the virtues of the <italic>kakáram</italic>—they were
                        articulate and charismatic speakers and generous in their gifts of
                        manufactured goods. But other missionaries had tried to convert Shuar in the
                        past and failed. There must be another reason why the Shuar, who had been
                        famous for resisting the power of the state even from Inka times, succumbed
                        so quickly to state-sponsored efforts to pacify and evangelize them in the
                        mid-twentieth century.</p>
                    <p>My final speculation is that this has to do with some of the features of
                        capitalism to which Marx (especially in Žižek’s reading)
                        called attention and that distinguish it and liberal states from tributary
                        empires like the Inka and the Spaniards. The labor contract promises the two
                        things that Shuar valued most: power and freedom. That it involves the
                        alienation of one’s labor power would not necessarily have troubled
                        Shuar, who were used to the exchange of their <italic>arútam</italic>
                        powers or the exercise of violence during raids. I suggest that the first
                        generation of Shuar who had regular contact with settlers in the twentieth
                        century saw that the settlers who had access to money were able to purchase
                        a seemingly endless variety of manufactured goods. They need not have felt
                        any malaise, and all my informants agree that their grandparents and parents
                        continued to seek the powers available only through plant-granted visions.
                        But money must have appeared to them to be a new kind of desirable
                        power.</p>
                    <p>How did their children make sense of this new world? One informant, who was
                        born 12 years before the founding of the Federation, told
                                me,<disp-quote>

                                cultivate and that did not have any value. They did not eat the
                                papachina while I did eat rice, but there was the sense of shame
                                because I did not have money. I don’t have money, because
                                money has to do with it, if I had had money or my parents, we would
                                eat rice, the same as them. If you have money it has value and if
                                you don’t have to spend any money it doesn’t have any
                                value; that is it, more or less.</p>
                  </disp-quote>A generation of
                        Shuar understood commodity fetishism before they understood what a life of
                        wage labor entails.</p>
                    <p>Shuar also routinely complain about the racism that they experienced as
                        children, from Ecuadorian teachers. Might it be that it was through this
                        entry into a different (Hispanic) Symbolic that Shuar children experienced a
                        kind of “castration,” one experienced as a lack that could be
                        filled only through the pursuit of expensive commodities? Racist teachers
                        are like the <italic>arútam wakán′</italic> in that they
                        are supposed to grant power, but their message of the
                        Symbolic—Lacan’s “thou art not”—is not
                        emancipating but demeaning. What most Shuar learn at mission schools and
                        from observing settlers is that one can have the speech of the other but not
                        its power; this is what Oedipalization is all about. The missionary and the
                        settler are the vanguards of state expansion. At stake are two radically
                        contrasting regimes of recognition: for Shuar, the real, the essence, is
                        internal. This means that they cannot recognize whether or not a Shuar
                        possesses an <italic>arútam</italic>; they can only infer as much
                        through its effects. Ecuadorians, on the other hand, recognize their
                        inferiors immediately; their schema of essences is superficial, immediately
                        recognizable in the ordinary world. Ecuadorian racism gives the settlers an
                        identity that binds them to the state and its laws of language, but this
                        racism, in turn, gives the Shuar an image of him- or herself as
                        marginal.</p>
                    <p>Simultaneously, the Shuar Federation (and Ecuadorian laws considering
                        inheritance) is creating “the name of the father” through local
                        patrilineages (Rubenstein 2002:240). Although many households still function in many ways as
                        they used to, as mobile and ultimately ephemeral loci in fluid social
                        networks, Shuar territory is being reinscribed through the creation of
                        landing strips and, more importantly, roads. Different communities have
                        radically different levels of access to market towns, which determines what
                        portion of land can be devoted to the production of commodities. While
                        actual household structure remains fluid, a familial ideology is being
                        instilled in Shuar, one that coordinates the sexual division of labor with
                        the emerging class system.</p>
                    <p>Following Žižek and Deleuze and Guattari, I believe that the
                        myth of a contract that is between equals and freely entered into is the
                        guise through which one becomes complicit in one’s own symbolic
                        emasculation. To be clear, I am arguing for a certain kind of equivalence
                        between the murders executed by Aguaruna warriors against poor settlers that
                        Greene (2009:152) reports and the
                        contract that a capitalist enters into with a worker or the state enters
                        into with its subjects. The significant difference is <italic>not</italic>
                        that Aguaruna violence is literal and the violence of these contracts is
                        metaphorical. It is the transformation of the violence from literal to
                        symbolic that is precisely what makes the key difference possible, that is,
                        the reversal of the direction of violence from being against others to being
                        against one’s self. In both cases the victims are innocent, and for
                        me, the importance of the theoretical apparatus of this essay (Lacan,
                        Clastres, etc.) is how they help me conceive of that unoccupiable locus from
                        which both forms of violence are equally appalling and equally unfathomable
                        but still equal. For Shuar, I believe that Ecuadorian colonialism was the
                        process through which, at some specific point (which, pace Zeno, cannot be
                        isolated analytically), they momentarily came to occupy this locus, where
                        one system of violence could be exchanged for the other.</p>
                    <p>Shuar today exhibit a variety of attitudes toward the diverse forms of power
                        in their world. Older Shuar often freely talk about the plant-granted
                        visions of their youth, perhaps because they long ago traded in the value of
                        the vision for the value of the written word, probably because they believe
                        that the days of feuding and warfare are behind them and do not fear the
                        loss of an <italic>arútam</italic> power. Many younger Shuar seek as
                        much formal education as possible, hoping that textual knowledge will bring
                        them power (including, many say, the power to help their communities). Many
                        feel that they have no choice but to sell the timber on their land or seek
                        wage-paying jobs in order to feed and clothe their own children. Some
                        question the value of plant-granted visions and other rituals practiced by
                        their parents. And others are profoundly disturbed by the kind of power that
                        comes with literacy and money, because they are not convinced that it will
                        bring them either power or freedom.</p>
                    <p>Ironically, at the same time that the Shuar Federation secures the
                        recognition of the Ecuadorian state and, moreover, produces more and more
                        written accounts of Shuar myth and ritual, more and more Shuar express an
                        anxiety that they are losing their culture (see Rival 1997 on a similar tension among the Ecuadorian
                        Huaorani). Their world has changed, but it continues to be one of deception
                        and misrecognition. I know several Shuar who have continued to seek
                        plant-granted visions or say that they will. And for some, there is still a
                        great deal at stake in secrecy.</p>

            <title>The End of Analysis</title>
            <p>Descola remarks on the profound identity crisis of the old
                    <italic>kakáram</italic> when he encountered the power of writing; this
                is a pain that is echoed when my informants relate to me stories of their
                experiences at mission schools (Descola 1996:353–356; see Lyons 2001,
                MacCormack 1991, and Orta 2004 for discussions of the dynamic between
                visionary, textual, and oral sources or forms of knowledge in indigenous-missionary
                relations in the Andes). Descola’s larger point, that what we literati imagine
                to be a positive form of recognition may in fact be devastating to Amerindian
                culture, is one of the thoughts motivating this essay.<sup>73</sup> Thus, when I crouch forward, pen and notepad in hand,
                only to hear an informant tell me that her vision is a secret, I do not perceive an
                obstacle to my research but rather a social fact that, in this context, is also an
                act of resistance against colonialism. I also perceive an invitation to reflect on
                those bits of a culture the importance of which lies in their not being shared.</p>
            <p>Shuar understand that mutual acknowledgment between people is superficial and
                fleeting. As Taylor points out, “As in any competitive social structure, the
                hierarchy of individuals is very unstable and their relative positions are
                constantly shifting” (Taylor 2007:151). An ally, even a relative, today may become an enemy
                    tomorrow.<sup>74</sup> Shuar tell me that
                it is their power-granting visions that provide them with the resources to negotiate
                this shifting terrain. I would like to suggest that, for Shuar, visions play the
                role that Lacan hoped analysis could play for his patients. Visions interrupt
                discourse and take a Shuar to “the ecstatic limit of ‘<italic>Thou art
                    that</italic>’ where the cipher of his mortal destiny is revealed to
                him” (Lacan 2006 [1949]:81). But these
                visions accomplish even more: they bring Shuar to the point where the true journey
                begins.</p>
            <p>Bob Scholte argued that “the possibility of communicative interaction is the
                irreducible epistemological precondition to any anthropological knowledge
                whatsoever” (Scholte 1969:440).
                Following Lacan, I would suggest that mutual recognition is impossible in the realm
                of language. But I do not mean to entirely disavow Adolf Bastian’s principle
                of the psychic unity of humankind, which Scholte evokes in the quotation above. As
                my observations on Shuar culture suggest, Shuar themselves are aware of the
                impossibility of recognition in language. An anthropology in the Bastian tradition
                may still be possible if we acknowledge this as a situation shared by all humans.
                Shuar, after all, do not then give up entirely on speech. Neither should
                anthropologists give up on ethnography. The speculations in this essay—the
                chain of ideas unleashed—sometimes feel as if they could go on forever. Yet to
                admit that they are speculations is to call them into question. I am not enough of a
                Lacanian to dismiss them as illusions. But perhaps one could say that they are
                surrogates for (or traces of) some unspeakable kernel of the Real that an
                anthropologist encounters through ethnographic fieldwork. This kernel fuels a
                “surplus <italic>jouissance</italic>” that an anthropologist feels when
                encountering a “society against the state”—and a desire to return
                to this kernel, even when professional obligations and the academic calendar make
                this impossible.<sup>75</sup>
         </p>
            <p>Unlike traditional psychoanalysts, Lacan rejected the idea of sessions of uniform
                (and necessarily arbitrary) duration. He believed that the act of terminating a
                session was itself part of the therapeutic process and had to be determined
                strategically by the analyst, whether the result was a session that lasted 2 hours
                or one that lasted 2 minutes. I am concerned that ethnographers today recommend
                ideal periods for fieldwork that conveniently fit university rules concerning leave
                or the dictates of funders (while we strategically forget the often idiosyncratic
                practices of earlier fieldworkers). Ironically, I believe that most of my colleagues
                agree that fieldwork never ends. Surely, this testifies more to the unpredictability
                of social life than to its regularity. We might do well to follow Lacan’s
                example and rely less on convention and more on deliberate experimentation in
                deciding when one must leave the field or end an article.</p>
            <p>I believe that this would be a necessary component of an ethnography that seeks to
                identify precisely those places where we seek—and, thank God, fail—to
                “capture” our object of study. Such places do not signify the failure of
                anthropology (or rather, they do signal the failure of an anthropology that we do
                well to disavow). On the contrary, I propose that such places are the closest anyone
                can come to recognizing the creative vitality of our informants and their culture.
                This place, I argue, is where we recognize that our informants have their own lives
                (messy and unpredictable, but also containing vital self-direction) to live and that
                ethnography can, and must, come to an end.</p>
