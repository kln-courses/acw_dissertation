PAUL COLOMY University of Denver During the last several years there has been a resurgence of interest in functionalism. General theoretical concerns, sometimes pejoratively called "metatheory," have assumed center stage in this revival. What is distinctive and refreshing about Michael Faia's Dynamic Functionalism is the unrelenting effort to systematize a function- alist explanatory model and to demonstrate how that model and empirically specified variants of it can be rigorously tested. The core of the book is divided into three parts. The first part, consisting of four chapters, identifies the distinctive elements of functional- ism, which, according to Faia, comprise a unique form of analysis yet to be fully appreciated. The book's first chapter clears the brush, shearing the core elements of functional analysis from the more peripheral ones. Faia maintains that the distinctive thrust of functional analysis is its commitment to explain social structures by reference to their consequences and a concomitant emphasis on feedback, self-regulation, cybernetic control, and circular causation. On the other hand, functional analy- sis does not presume any anthropomorphic teleology, assume that every structure has an identifiable function, adopt a logic of indispens- ability, or dictate that actors' intentions be ignored. Chapter 2 specifies the notions of social survivorship and the mortality of social organizations and outlines a variation and selective retention model for analyzing how an environment selects out or reinforces specific social structures. Chapter 3 introduces the logic of the life table and employs several examples to demonstrate how life-table analysis contributes to our understanding of social survivorship. Part 1 concludes with chapter 4, where Faia discusses the dynamic character of functional analysis, its ability to explain linear and nonlinear social patterns, and the necessity for both time series data and the most sophisticated techniques to analyze such data. Chapter 5, which introduces Part 2, discusses adaptation theories-i.e., theories that explain how changes in one part of a system help to resolve problems generated in another part-and describes the causal (and functional) logic underlying adaptation processes. Chapter 6 provides an introduction to time-series analyses, and demonstrates their utility for assessing functional hypotheses. Part 3 tackles more general theoretical issues. Chapter 7 argues that the form of functionalist propositions represents the most advanced ap- proach to sociological theorizing, and calls for social scientists to move toward a "functionalist culmination." Faia introduces his own definition of social science theory, and suggests that the widely noted convergence on the methods appropriate for the creation of theories can and should contribute to the formation of a single theoretical paradigm. The book concludes with an appendix that presents a historical and theoretical appraisal of functionalist analysis which commences with Spencer and concludes with Parsons. In my estimation, this book makes a very important contribution to contemporary theory and methodology. It persuasively demonstrates how the potential of functionalist analysis has yet to be fully exploited. By outlining the core of functional analysis-feedback, self-regu- lation, the variation and selective retention model and adaptation processes-and coupling these core components of functionalist analysis with sophisticated statistical programs, Faia provides an essential corrective to the contem- porary discussion of functionalism which has been heavily tilted toward general theorizing. Finally, though the arguments are not presented</page><page sequence="2">266 REVIEWS in sufficient detail, Faia indicates how at the levels of models and hypotheses, functionalism and its purported theoretical antagonists (e.g., Marxism) exhibit considerable overlap. The book is not without its difficulties, of course. The argument for an integrated para- digm and a functionalist culmination, for example, is not compelling, at least not to me. Overall, however, Faia's book is an exciting and engaging work destined to generate controversy and, I hope, a more appreciative understanding of functionalism.</page></plain_text>
