<plain_text><page sequence="1">Did the Priests Have a "Name" Theology? S. Tamar Kamionkowski Introduction The topic of the following essay is a reconsideration of the meaning of the phrase 1X לחלל את שם in the Holiness writings.2 My thesis is that this phrase is a significant priestly theologoumenon developed by the Holiness (H) school in response to Priestly (P) theology. Before elaborating on this thesis, I will first set the stage by explaining the background of the internal priestly debate. In developing this argument, I refute the common understanding of this phrase as referring to God's concern with God's reputation. I argue that this understanding of שם as "reputation" applies to Ezekiel's mis- or reuse of H's material and that Ezekiel's reworking has become the dominant postbiblical reading, thereby obscuring H's unique usage. Given the common equation of "profanation of the Name" with "insult to reputation," my essay must begin with a presentation of the dominant argument, the reasons for its persuasiveness, and then the flaws that invite a fresh rethinking of this formula. The second part of this study will set a new context for this formula. The context assumes certain relative dating for H and P, along with particular theories regarding holiness in priestly thinking. The third and final section of this examination entails a careful reading of the "profanation of the Name" passages in H, along with other relevant passages. It is in this final section where I will lay out in detail my thesis concerning the theological significance of this phrase. By the very nature of this project, I cover many different areas of research and place myself within a number of hotly contested areas of debate. My indebtedness to the work of a number of scholars will be evident on the pages that follow. I am X may refer to YHWH, Elohim or the epithet Kodesh. Israel Knohl (Sanctuary of Silence [Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995]) and Baruch Schwartz (The Holiness Legislation: Studies in the Priestly Code [Jerusalem: The Hebrew University Magnes Press, 1999; in Hebrew]) use the term "holiness legislation" (תורת הקדושה) to indicate that in their estimation the H material is not a specific law code, but rather a literary supplement that renews and reworks P.

Even where I disagree with them in small measure, my respect for their insights and breadth of knowledge is immense. Refuting the Consensus At this juncture in biblical scholarship, there is broad consensus regarding the meaning of X לחלל את שם in the Bible. Although only one article that I am aware of has devoted itself solely to better understanding this phrase, a number of scholars make passing reference to this term. On the face of it, the general understanding seems sound and persuasive. I will use the dedicated study of Sheldon Blank to represent the current consensus. Blank's starting point in his investigation was a text critical emendation of Isa 52:5 which resulted in the posited phrase, X לחלל את שם, in the Book of Isaiah. This outcome led him to consider the meaning of the phrase more broadly. Blank astutely argues that the biblical claim that God's name is profaned because of God's people can mean one of two things: "God is defamed by the shameful conduct of his people, or b) God is disgraced because of the disgraceful condition of his people."3 According to Blank, Jer 34:16 is chronologically the first text to use this phrase, followed by the texts in Leviticus, all of which use X לחלל את שם to indicate that God's name can be profaned by Israelite conduct. Ezekiel is then the first to use the formula to suggest that God's name can be profaned by the condition of Israel, not its conduct. By this he means that Israel's tragic fate in exile is seen as a disgrace to God and God's reputation among the other nations. Among his concluding remarks, Blank argues that the word "name" "adds the idea of reputation, fame, prestige, recognition. To profane the name of God is to do damage to God's reputation, to defame him, to lessen his prestige, to retard the process by which he achieves recognition, to put off the day on which it shall be known that he is God."4 This argument is followed closely by Moshe Greenberg who, in discussing Ezekiel 36, argues that the very condition of exile desecrated God's name among the nations. The return from exile was necessary in order to preserve God's good name.5 Blank's position can certainly be supported by general studies on the word 6.שם Sheldon H. Blank, "Isaiah 52:5 and the Profanation of the Name," HUCA 25 (1954): 1-8 (6). For a recent reaffirmation of this reading, see Jacob Milgrom, "The Desecration of Yhwh's Name: Its Parameters and Significance," in Shai le-Sara Japhet: Studies in the Bible, its Exegesis, and its Language (ed. Moshe Bar-Asher, Dalit Rom-Shiloni, Emanuel Tov, Nili Wazana; Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 2007), 317*-25*. Blank, "Isaiah 52:5 and the Profanation of the Name," 8. See also Baruch A. Levine, Leviticus (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1989), 128. Moshe Greenberg, Ezekiel 21-37 (AB; New York: Doubleday, 1997), esp. 733-38. See for example the studies by Adam S. van der Woude, "שם, name," Theological Lexicon of the Old Testament (ed. Emst Jenni and Claus Westermann; trans. Mark Biddle; Peabody, Mass.: [22*]</page><page sequence="3">Did the Priests Have a "Name" Theology? Names of deities and people were imbued with power. Thus the name had a power in and of itself, especially if it was associated with great fame, and in this sense, שם may be connected to "reputation" (cf. Deut 26:19 and Jer 13:11 where שם and תהלה appear together). Proverbs 22:1 states unambiguously that a name held in honor is more precious than great wealth. God is credited with making a name for Godself in delivering Israel from Egypt (cf. Isa 63:12, 14; Jer 32:20; Dan 9:15; and Neh 9:10).7 Therefore, if a name could mean that which characterizes its bearer, then misuse of the name could defame the individual or deity. This logic leads to the conclusion that שם in reference to YHWH can refer to God's glory or fame. Therefore, X לחלל את שם refers to blaspheming God and causing injury to God's honor. Additionally, we can cite other texts in which God is unambiguously concerned with what others think of Him. Moses, for example, implores God not to destroy Israel on the basis of God's reputation during the Gold Calf episode (Exod 32:12; cf. Deut 9:28), and similarly during the negative report of the spies (Num 14:15-16). In support of taking X לחלל את שם as indicative of God's concern with his reputation, we can look to postbiblical Jewish sources, up to the present. Avraham Holtz argues that the terms kiddush hashem and hillul hashem are only relevant in the context of other nations, "for without the awareness of the nations apparently no Kiddush Hashem can take place, the Lord can not be sanctified without the awareness of the nations."8 God unfolds His plan for the world through Israel, but it is ultimately the other nations who are needed by God to effect his sanctification. In the postbiblical era, it becomes the obligation of the Jew to sanctity God's name through daily behavior and even a martyr's death. Through martyrdom, the Jew announces his devotion to God while the "others" witness this deed. Hillul hashem, by contrast, is regarded as any public action that puts the God of Israel or the Jewish people in a bad light. The Orkhot Tzaddikim, a 15th c. anonymous work, describes hillul hashem as a wrongful act that others witness and from which they might take example.9 From this brief overview, we can summarize the following: Ezekiel's work is the starting point and focus for the biblical understanding of the formula.

[23*]</page><page sequence="4">S. Tamar Kamionkowski term centers on God's reputation in light of the other nations. This is substantiated by the use of שם as reputation and by the clear context in which Ezekiel sets his writing. The idea of God's reputation in the world is then continued on through centuries of Jewish interpretation. It is not my intention to refute the arguments above, except in one small, but significant aspect. I will argue that Ezekiel has reffamed H's earlier use of X לחלל את שם, and that for H, this formula had little to do with God's reputation. In isolation, H reflects no concern with God's reputation among the nations. The H school sets its literary document in the wilderness of Sinai prior to entrance into the land of Israel.10 Within this setting, the people of Israel are in isolation and the primary relationship is between the community of Israel and God. By contrast, Ezekiel's literary framework is the exile and the people are in the midst of an alien land. When we set H within the context of priestly writings, we can better understand X לחלל את שם as an internal, priestly polemic against P theology. It is only later that Ezekiel picks up on this phrase and recontextualizes it rather radically. Although Ezekiel is usually the focal or entry point, this study will 1) centralize H's use of this formula; 2) more carefully examine the concept of חלל in a priestly context; and 3) set the broader context of this formula within a priestly frame of thinking. Since the phrase X לחלל את שם appears only in H and Ezekiel, it must be considered in light of specific priestly thinking. Establishing a New Framework My argument is founded upon a series of hypotheses regarding the relationship of H to P and the relative dating of these works. For my purposes, I need not assert a particular date for the composition of H, but relative dating is essential to my argument. First, I do believe, with Israel Knohl," Jacob Milgrom,12 Baruch Schwartz,13 David P. Wright,14 Jan Joosten,15 and a handful of others, that there is a distinct body of literature produced by a priestly group that is differentiated from the works of P by literary style, philological variation, worldview, and theology, and that is chronologically later than most of the P writings.

I believe that H is a polemical response and supplement to P thinking. I make no claims about the specific dates of these works, but I am profoundly influenced by the linguistic evidence presented by Avi Hurvitz20 and the sophisticated theological observations made by Milgrom and Knohl in considering H as a priestly revision of preexilic P cultic writings. I am convinced by the positions of Milgrom and Knohl21 regarding the following points: H is a polemical rejoinder to and theological revision of earlier P cultic material. H represents a priestly response to prophetic critiques regarding the needs of ordinary Israelites. H democratizes P^ holiness, extending it beyond the priests to all of Israel and beyond the Sanctuary to the entire land of Israel. H uses anthropomorphic language to describe a God invested in the affairs of human beings. H expands proper conduct beyond the realm of the purely cultic to include ethical behavior as well.22 Philip Peter Jenson, Graded Holiness: A Key to the Priestly Conception of the World (JSOTSup 106; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1992). While I find Jenson's "Holiness Spectrum" a valuable tool in unlocking the priestly systems of thought, I am in strong disagreement with Jenson's assertion that "H is closer to P than to any other part of the Old Testament" (24). In some cases H shares more with D or with the prophetic traditions than it does with P. I believe that if a scholar recognizes the existence of P and H, and is doing research in priestly thinking, they are methodologically required to consider these strata separately.

These last two points are argued specifically by Knohl, Sanctuary of Silence. [25*]</page><page sequence="6">S. Tamar Kamionkowski To understand the radical nature of H's theology, we must appreciate the theology of P to which H was responding. Stephen Geller describes the God of P as a "tremendous force ... essentially mechanical."23 Knohl asserts, regarding P literary blocks that have been placed after the narrative of the erection of the Tabernacle, that The revelation of the name of Yahweh results in a Copernican revolution. Moses and, following him, Israel learns to recognize the divine nature, which is unrelated to creation, or to humanity and its needs. This dimension cannot be fully comprehended by humans and surpasses the limits of morality and reason, since morality and its laws are only meaningful in relation to human society and human understanding. The aspect of the divine essence that surpasses reason and morality—the 'numinous' element—is represented in PT by the name of Yahweh ... the impersonal, nonanthropomorphic language of the period of Moses expresses the majesty of the holy and its awesomeness.24 The morality of God in P is still being debated, but the general nature of P's God, as a nonanthropomorphic, force-like God who is physically immanent, but dangerously other, is generally agreed upon. The conclusions that I draw regarding H's conception of holiness are based on and further the implications I believe to be implicit in the works of Knohl, Milgrom and Schwartz. The research of Knohl, Milgrom, Joosten and Schwartz has shown that while P holiness is static, H holiness is dynamic, or to use my own terminology, H holiness is pliable and malleable. According to Milgrom, "The dynamic catalyst that turns H's view of the Lord's covenant from a static picture into one of flux is its concept of holiness. For H, the ideal of holiness is not only embodied in a limited group (priests), animals (sacrifices), and space (sanctuary) but affects all who live on God's land: persons and animals, Israel and the 25".גר For Milgrom, the idea of dynamic holiness means that Israel can enhance its collective holiness in proportion to its observance of God's commandments. This also suggests to me that the boundaries between the holy and profane are somewhat malleable.26 Stephen A. Geller, "The God of the Covenant," in One God or Many? Concepts of Divinity in the Ancient World (ed. Barbara Nevling Porter; Transactions of the Casco Bay Assyriological Institute 1; [Chebeague, Me]: Casco Bay Assyriological Institute, 2000), 273-319 (278). See also his detailed study, Sacred Enigmas: Literary Religion in the Hebrew Bible (London and New York: Routledge, 1996), chap. 4. Rnohl, Sanctuary of Silence, 146-47. Jacob Milgrom, "The Changing Concept of Holiness," 71. Eyal Regev juxtaposes D and P/H, arguing that D represents static holiness and that priestly holiness is dynamic. Since D describes holiness as a condition or quality of the Israelite people in covenant with God, he concludes that D's holiness is static. He then equates the graded holiness of priestly thinking with dynamic holiness. See "Priestly Dynamic Holiness and Deuteronomic Static Holiness." Regev's work is problematic insofar as he equates graded holiness with [26*]</page><page sequence="7">Did the Priests Have a "Name" Theology? Schwartz devotes more of a consideration to the meaning of קדש, noting that there are two distinct, more identical Semitic roots. While קדש II means "cleanse," קדש I has the sense of "separated," or "designated for." According to Schwartz, this is the root that expresses God as a "totally Other" transcendent being. God can make things holy, which means that God can take people, objects, and places, and make them His, so that they become the personal property of God. The holiness of YHWH is thus a quality describing the essence of the divine being, while holiness of people and objects is acquired through designation or contact with the divine.27 According to Schwartz as soon as God "took up residence in His earthly abode according to H, the holiness which He exuded began to radiate upon Israel as a whole, making them His."28 God's holiness is therefore an "effusion of His essence rather than a mere designation or election."29 Just as God exudes holiness on the people of Israel, they are enjoined to seek it out, to reach for the holy. The conferring of holiness is thus a two-way street. Schwartz concludes his discussion of H holiness by claiming that the failure of Israel to perform the commandments is a profanation of the Name. In other words, God "sanctifies them by His presence if they keep His laws, and this in turn is what perpetuates His own holiness."30 The next logical step, which Schwartz does not take, is to ask what it means that the people have the power to hold God back from perpetuating God's holiness. In other words, in this mutual relationship, how far does the power of the people go with respect to God's holiness? This is one of the central questions that I will address in my reading of hillul hashem. To date, the many studies on holiness in the priestly works have focused on holiness as that which is designated for God, or set apart as God-related. Thus, scholars of priestly thought have studied, in great detail, the holiness and profanation of people, objects, and places. However, there is relative silence on the question of what it means to desecrate God's name, another common object of desecration, along with people, objects and places. Scholars tend to skirt around the issue, only offering passing reference to this area of concern. The H theologians were calling for a radically new understanding of the relationship between God and Israel. To the extent that P distances God from the life of Israel, H dynamic holiness. A system can be graded, but static; I believe that P operates in this fashion. It is also problematic to assert that P and H have relatively coherent theologies, especially when the object of investigation is holiness. Schwartz, Holiness Legislation, 258. Schwartz, "Israel's Holiness," 55. See also his Holiness Legislation, esp. 250-56, for a more extensive discussion of these two roots. Schwartz, "Israel's Holiness," 55. Schwartz, "Israel's Holiness," 58. Joosten argues that the expression "to profane my holy name" may imply that transgression of God's commandments desecrates the bond between Israel and God and further leads to the defilement of the sanctuary (People and Land in the Holiness Code, 132-33). [27*]</page><page sequence="8">S. Tamar Kamionkowski brings God into a profound intimacy. The knot that binds God and Israel is holiness, and the term that expresses this aspect of the divine, in intimate relationship with Israel, is שם or שם קדשי. This terminology stands in contrast to P's use of the term כבוד, to signify the immanent yet nonanthropomorphic divine presence of P. It is my belief that the H writers were expressing a key element of their God belief through the technical terminology of hillul has hem. The Use of "the Name" in the Holiness Code It is my contention that the phrase X לחלל את שם is a significant priestly theologoumenon developed by the H writers in response to an earlier P theology. The phrase appears with frequency in H, while it never appears in P texts. The name of God, YHWH, was undoubtedly of central importance to the priests, but the term שם is never used by the P writers to convey information about their God beliefs. The phrase לחלל את X שם appears with frequency in the Holiness Code and in the Book of Ezekiel. Apart from these occurrences, the phrase appears only once in Jer 34:16 and in Amos 2:7, a verse that is considered suspect by several commentators.31 The distribution of this phrase indicates that it is indeed a priestly term, albeit not a P phrase! This phrase is a significant priestly technical formula developed by the H priestly writers in response to an earlier P theology. The phrase does not simply indicate God's concern with God's own reputation, but the H writers' concern with Israel's power to have a direct impact on an aspect of the divine, that aspect entitled the שם. The prophets believed that God can be and is continually influenced by Israel's actions; God responds to Israel's sins through absence, direct punishment (like exile) or instrumental punishment. The P writers believed that Israel could drive God away from the holy center through acts of ritual impurity. The H writers believed that God could not only be driven away, but also be substantively affected by Israel's wrongdoings. In this sense, I assert that חלל should be understood in the literal sense of desecrate, that is "to reduce the sacredness of," and that the aspect of God that people could affect in this manner is God's שם. The phrase X לחלל את שם is theologically loaded. H has developed this language in order to convert P's notion of static holiness into a dynamic one. I will differ from and further contribute to the work of Milgrom and Knohl in two regards here. First of all, neither writer has considered this phrase to be a central H theological concept. Secondly, where Milgrom talks about dynamic holiness, he means the ability of Israel to attain greater holiness; the dynamism is only on the side of Israel and the land. God's holiness is still stable and static in Milgrom's model. I will argue that 31 The phrase appears in slightly different formats inPs 74:7 and Jer 34:15-16. In these cases, it is the sanctuary for the name that is being profaned. [28*]</page><page sequence="9">Did the Priests Have a "Name" Theology? holiness is dynamic on the divine side as well. Where P argues that God's presence, God's כבוד is a stable, pine holiness, H will argue the very opposite. The phrase X לחלל את שם is therefore an important theologoumenon for the H writers, standing in sharp contrast to both P's כבוד and D's שם theologies. 1. חלל in H The verb חלל appears eighteen times in the Holiness Code, indicating that it is a key H term. The LXX consistently uses the word ßeßqXoco, the Targum חלל, to represent the MT חלל. Otherwise, the term appears only in Exod 31:14 and Num 18:32, both passages that have been identified as HS by Knohl.32 Assuming that Knohl is correct, the P writers never use this term! Moreover, the nominal form, חל, appears only one time in all of the priestly writings (Lev 10:10).33 Although the root appears in other biblical texts, my interest is in its particular meaning for the H school. The word is usually translated as "profane," but my preferred translation is "desecrate," which more accurately renders the word in opposition to "sanctify," or "make holy." I will have more say about this below. Milgrom has consistently argued that "P's precise distinction between טמא 'pollute' and חלל 'desecrate' begins to dissolve in H and even more so in Ezekiel."34 He points to examples wherein H uses the term טמא in noncultic, nonritualistic contexts (Lev 18:25, impurity of the land; Lev 20:3, impurity caused by Molech worship; Lev 18:20, impurity caused by adultery). In each of these contexts, impurity cannot refer to cultic impurity, for which proper rituals and sacrifices can atone; rather, the concept of impurity is here metaphoric. Similarly, Milgrom argues that the use of חלל is also loose and metaphoric in H. For example, a priest who is ritually contaminated by corpse contact should, according to P thinking, become טמא; but H utilizes the term חלל to describe the priest (Lev 21:2^4). This makes no sense to Milgrom, so his conclusion is that H is simply not precise in its use of terminology. However, the assertion that H uses these terms indiscriminately reflects our own inability to understand the terminology and formulae of H. Schwartz and Knohl have both shown, in different ways, how carefully the H writers use specific phrases to polemicize against or to supplement the work of P.35 Therefore, we must assume that the frequent usage of חלל in H is of some significance. Knohl, Sanctuary of Silence, 104-5. This rare occurrence is rather extraordinary given the centrality of the secondary literature on the concept of profane status in the priestly writings. The many schemata that have been devised to set up the polarities between the holy and profane in priestly thinking are not necessarily reflective of the P writings themselves. See for example the work of Philip Peter Jenson, Graded Holiness, for a series of diagrams presented throughout the book. Milgrom, Leviticus 17-22,1801. Jonathan Klawans has argued that the impurity system applied to nonritual impurity in priestly material is no less literal and technical than the system applied to ritual impurity. He [29*]</page><page sequence="10">S. Tamar Kamionkowski H uses the term חלל in relation to a priest, his daughter, his general offspring, and his potential wives. Each of these persons can be the object of desecration. A priest who comes in contact with a corpse defiles himself and thereby desecrates himself36 לא יטמא בעל37 בעמיו להחלו (Lev. 21:4). H does accord with P by designating the priest ritually impure (טמא), but H supplements P's system with another status change: the priest is not just rendered ritually impure, he is also desecrated. A priest can also be desecrated by the sexually illicit behavior of his daughter (Lev 21:9). B. Sanh. 52a interprets this passage to indicate that others in the community will no longer treat the priest with respect. Milgrom, influenced by this passage and postbiblical understandings of חלול השם, believes that this verse must be metaphorical. The priest is not literally stripped of his status, but he is shamed by his daughters actions. He writes, "it is as though he were disqualified."38 However, Milgrom adduces no evidence to argue his point. The evidence from within H shows that the priest has in fact been diminished in status.39 Milgrom himself writes elsewhere that in H, the priests are enjoined to observe the commandments in order to retain their holy status; this assumes that they can lose their status as well.40 A woman of priestly family can also be desecrated, although it is not altogether clear under what circumstances this desanctification occurs.41 In Lev 19:29 and Lev 21:9, the daughter of a priest has engaged in some sort of illicit sexual activity. In the latter case, she is held responsible for her shift in status, and in the former the father bears the responsibility. That she bears some degree of holiness as a member of the priestly family is worthy of note. The same inferences can be drawn concerning the status of wives and other forbidden women in Lev 21:7 and 21:14. Leviticus 21:12 commands the priest not to leave the sanctuary, presumably in order to moum a family member while he is on duty.42 distinguished between ritual and moral impurity, asserting that both are literal and belong to distinct and comprehensive symbolic systems (Impurity and Sin in Ancient Judaism [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003], esp. 3-42), The verbal form is a reflexive niphal. The suggestion of Meir Paran ("Literary Features of the Priestly Code: Stylistic Patterns, Idioms and Structures" [Ph.D. diss., The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1983], 152-53) that בעל is a textual error based on partial dittography with בעמיו is persuasive given the fact that בעל appears to be an incomplete construct. Milgrom, Leviticus 17-22, 1800, brought Paran's work to my attention. Milgrom, Leviticus 17-22, 1810. Levine, Leviticus, 144, implies the same reading of the text. Cf. 4Q213a 3-43: "She will profane her name and her father's name." Milgrom, "The Changing Concept of Holiness," esp. 70. For discussion, see Milgrom Leviticus 17-22, 1696-97. See discussion in Milgrom, Leviticus 17-22, 1818. [30*]</page><page sequence="11">Did the Priests Have a "Name" Theology? ומן המקדש לא יצא ולא יחלל את מקדש אלהיו כי נזר שמן משחת43 אלהיו עליו אני יהוה The result of this transgression is profanation of the sanctuary. Milgrom again describes the use of חלל here as imprecise, because corpse contamination results in impurity (טמאה) not desecration.44 Joosten argues that חלל here is just a first step in profanation, which may later lead to impurity. For him, the more dangerous state is טמא, because it is this state that drives the divine out of the sanctuary.45 H describes the desecration of the sanctuary in one other verse, Lev 21:23. A priest46 may not approach the veil or the altar with a blemish; doing so results in desecration of the sanctuary, but not in impurity. Besides the sanctuary, objects that have been consecrated to God can also be desecrated. Thus, Lev 19:8 teaches that improper consumption of a well-being offering desecrates the offering. And Lev 22:9 also suggests that the sacred meal can be desecrated47 So far we have seen that people (especially those of the priestly family), the sanctuary, and sanctified objects can all become desecrated. Milgrom has argued that we should take this language metaphorically in most instances. However, if H's holiness is dynamic, and people and things can move toward greater degrees of holiness, then it stands to reason that each of these people and things can also experience a reduction in holiness. A sacrificial food can lose its sacred quality and become a source of sin. The sanctuary can experience the withdrawal of the holy presence, and a priest can lose his status for himself and/or his descendants. The sacrifice becomes just a piece of meat, the sanctuary just a building, and the priest just a man. In each of these cases, the H writers choose to use the language of חלל in addition to P's טמא terminology. In other words, H overlays standard P material with the concept of חלל. In H, חלל signifies a real reduction in holiness status. 2. X לחלל את שם Leviticus 21:6 enjoins the priests to be holy for their God and to refrain from desecrating the name of their God, for it is they who minister in God's sanctum: קדשים יהיו לאלהיהם ולא יחללו שם אלהיהם כי את אשי יהוה לחם אלהיהם הם מקריבם והיו קדש The contrast drawn in v. 6 is between the human aspiration to reach God's holiness 1QM 9:8 makes reference to priestly oil of anointment and desecration. Milgrom, Leviticus 17-22, 1818. Joosten, People and Land in the Holiness Code, 126-27. Milgrom argues that this law applies only to the high priest (Leviticus 17-22, 1832). This is a difficult verse. The source of the 3ms referent is not altogether clear. Martin Noth (Leviticus: A Commentary [rev. ed.; OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1977; orig. pub. 1965], 155) posits that לחם is the subject since משמרתי is feminine. [31*]</page><page sequence="12">S. Tamar Kamionkowski (the verse begins with קדשים יהיו and ends with והיו קדש) and the human ability to desecrate , that is, to reduce the holiness of God. This verse describes a relationship of reciprocity vis ä vis holiness. This speaks to H's model of a dynamic holiness, one that can expand and contract on both the divine and human sides, depending on human action. This stands in marked contrast to P's static holiness. In Lev 22:2, the text reads: דבר אל אהרן ואל בניו וינזרו מקדשי בני ישראל ולא יחללו את שם קדשי אשר הם מקדשים לי אני יהוה The Hebrew syntax of this verse is difficult because the relative clause marked by אשר seems misplaced. Rashi describes this verse as twisted, and suggests that the middle clause should be put at the end. This has been the practice of commentators from the medieval period to the present. Thus, JPS: "Instruct Aaron and his sons to be scrupulous about the sacred donations that the Israelite people consecrate to Me, lest they profane My holy name, Mine the Lord's." In this translation, the participle מקדשים refers to the sacred donations. The context, which deals with the donations that Israel sanctifies, certainly verifies this reading. However, there is another possibility. If we read the verse more straightforwardly, without transposing the phrases, the participle מקדשים would then refer to the Name. "Instruct Aaron and his sons to be scrupulous about the sacred donations of the Israelite people; they should not desecrate My holy name which they sanctify for me, I am YHWH." In this particular case, the people sanctify the name of God, not the donation. The Israelite sanctification of the Name of God at the beginning of this chapter forms an inclusion with the end of the chapter in which (v. 32) we are told that God is sanctified in the midst of Israel, and Israel should not profane God's Name. The desecration of the name is inextricably linked to the people's potential and charge to sanctify God. Again, Israel has the power both to expand and contract God's holiness. Leviticus 22:32 appears as a summary statement following upon God's admonition to observe all of the commandments.48 The verse reads: ולא תחללו את שם קדשי49 ונקדשתי50 בתוך בני ישראל אני יהוה מקדשכם There are three assertions in this verse. First, "You should not desecrate my name of holiness." Secondly, "I am made holy in the midst of the people Israel." And 48 Schwartz opines that this generalized statement indicates that the observance of all the laws is a preventative against hillul hashem and that every transgression is a hillul hashem (The Holiness Legislation, 221). 49 This phrase appears in Lev 20:3; 22:2,32; Ezek 20:39-^0; 36:20-22; 39:7; 42:13; 43:7-8; Amos 2:7. 50 The niphal of the root קדש with God as the subject in priestly writings appears in Lev 10:3 and Num 20:13. [32*]</page><page sequence="13">Did the Priests Have a "Name" Theology? finally, "I am YHWH who makes you holy." In unambiguous language we have here the presentation of H theology as relational and mediated through the language of holiness: 1) People have the power to desecrate God's name, that is, to diminish God's holiness; 2) But if they do it then it impacts upon God's ability to make Godself holy among Israel (3 ;(ונקדשתי בתוך בני ישראל) And thereby Israel's holiness is diminished, since it is God who is ultimately their source of holiness. Again, חלול השם is not just about harming God's reputation or disobeying the word of God; it is about Israel's direct ability to affect God's holiness, which in tum, has an impact on the level of holiness that the community of Israel attains.51 Leviticus 20:3 is the most illuminating passage for our investigation. ואני אתן את פני באיש ההוא והכרתי אתו מקרב עמו כי מזרעו נתן למלך למען טמא את מקדשי ולחלל את שם קדשי In this verse, we are told that Molech worship affects God in two ways; first of all, it defiles God's sanctuary; and second, it desecrates his name.52 Are these two parallel statements, two sequential results of Molech worship,53 or do they signify two different effects of sin? The initial phrase in this verse stands in the tradition of P thinking with some revision. Certain wrongdoings (cultic/ritual for P and more expansive for H) can have a direct negative impact on the sanctity of God's sanctuary. טמאה is created by human actions and attaches itself not to God, but to God's objects, i.e., the sanctuary and its contents.54 In P writing, we might then find a priestly prescription for cleansing the טמא from the individual and from the sanctuary through blood sacrifice. Instead, H offers a supplemental phrase: "desecration of my holy name." P's cultic writings are exclusively concerned with the maintenance of the sanctity of the cult site in order to ensure God's כבוד in the midst of the people; the H inclusion of the term שם adds a new theological dimension to the former nonanthropomorphic, static theology of P. It is no longer sufficient to ensure the presence of the כבוד, argues H, but Israel must work to maintain the holiness of God's שם. Regarding oath taking, Schwartz argues that the 2d person use means that H is saying, "It's not just my Name that you are desecrating, but the name of your God." The name of YHWH is the only holiness that Israelites are entitled to have a part of, so its desecration is the desecration of all other holiness for Israel (The Holiness Legislation, 309.) Lev 18:21 forbids the dedication of children to Molech as well, and teaches that the result of this act is the desecration of the Name. Cf. Lev 20:2-5; 1 Kgs ll:7;2Kgs 23:10; Isa 57:9; Jer 32:33. See Schwartz, The Holiness Legislation, 187-203. Tannaitic literature seems to take these two phrase sequentially, cf. Sifra Kedoshim, Parasha 10:8: '"And so defiled My sanctuary and profaned My holy name': this teaches that [Molech worship] defiles the sanctuary, profanes the Name, causes the Divine Presence to depart, brings the sword upon Israel, and exiles them from their land." For a thorough analysis of this and related tannaitic sources, see Klawans, Impurity and Sin, 118-34. Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16, 258-61. [33*]</page><page sequence="14">S. Tamar Kamionkowsk.1 In a sense, Ezekiel, the prophet-priest, takes H writing a step further by changing למען טמא את מקדשי ולחלל את שם קדשי into למען טמא את שם קדשי, thus conflating the language of P and H. Affinities between H and Ezekiel have long been noted. Apart from H, Ezekiel is the only other writer to use the terminology, חלול שם. In Ezek 43:1-9, in the vision of the new Utopian Jerusalem Temple, Ezekiel is led to the east gate. He witnesses the כבוד of God coming to re-inhabit the Temple. He is then transported into the inner court and witnesses the kabod כבוד filling the room. The כבוד does not engage with Ezekiel directly—it is simply a force, a nonanthropomorphic presence of the divine. Then, a mysterious voice in the form of a man speaks to him. Note how the author is careful to distinguish the כבוד from the speaking aspect of the divine. ואשמע מדבר55 אלי מהבית ואיש היה עמד אצלי Lest anyone misunderstand and believe that the כבוד is speaking, the text inserts the image of a man/messenger. The voice announces, in language reminiscient of the ark traditions, that the כבוד will reside in the Holy of Holies for eternity. Then the voice announces that the Name of Holiness (שם קדשי) will not be rendered impure (טמא) again by the abominations of the kings56. Milgrom notices the oddity in the use of טמא for God's שם, because elsewhere in priestly writings טמא affects objects only. And in our context, we would expect חלל שם. An earlier P writer may have written "defile my sanctuary," but I believe that Ezekiel is combining the P כבוד and H שם theologies here by blending the terminology of the two. I do not believe, as Milgrom claims, that this is simply an example of Ezekiel's relaxed use of older precise terms, but that this reflects a theological shift. Ezekiel takes the P notion of defilement (usually restricted to God's sancta), and applies it to God's שם. The shift from desecration to defilement indicates that for Ezekiel, in this new Utopian vision, impurities do not just drive God's כבוד out as a matter of chemistry, but that God's שם is diminished as well. God responds to Israel's actions not only through a pattern of divine presence and absence, but qualitatively as well. If H democratizes P, as has been argued by several scholars, then God's שם is that aspect of God which is accessible to all of Israel and not just the priests. Milgrom argues that "God's name is the only sanctum other than the meat of the well-being offering that can be utilized by the laity."57 The P writers argued that impurities have Azzan Yadin argues for the priority of LXX, which reflects a Hebrew Vorlage of מדבר and he suggests that קול should be taken as a hypostasis ("קול as Hypostasis in the Hebrew Bible," JBL 122 [2003]: 601-26 [606-9]). Probably memorial stelae. See Margaret S. Odell, "What Was the Image of Jealousy in Ezekiel 8?"

[34*]</page><page sequence="15">Did the Priests Have a "Name" Theology? an impact on the sanctuary and may ultimately drive God's כבוד away, but H counters that while impurities and ethical wrongdoings have an impact on the sanctuary, they also directly impact upon an aspect of the divine being. The untouchable כבוד is replaced, or rather supplemented, by the relational שם. The inaccessible, force-like God of the P writers is here changed into the more accessible, intimate God of H. Israel's power as a partner in holiness is so central for H that a narrative cautionary text about exploiting this power is provided in Leviticus 24. Within the legal material of the Holiness Code, we find a single narrative text embedded. The fact that it is the only narrative text in the Code is worthy of note, but it is its content that is especially relevant for our purposes. The story begins abruptly with a fight between two men:58 one who had an Israelite mother (of the tribe of Dan) and an Egyptian father, and the other a full Israelite.59 In the midst of the fight, the half-Israelite invokes the Name and utters a curse, and is immediately taken into custody. God then instructs Moses to remove the man from the camp, have all who heard him lay their hands on him, and then have the community stone him. The narrative is then interrupted with a general legal statement prescribing stoning as the punishment for cursing God. This brief passage is packed with numerous difficulties, not all of which can be addressed here.60 The important questions for our purposes are: what does נקב mean? What does נקב mean within the context of קלל? And finally, what is the relationship between w. 11 and 16? In Leviticus 24, נקב appears exclusively in the qal. There are a number of instances in biblical passages where the qal of נקב has the basic sense of piercing. For example, in 2 Kgs 12:10, the priest Yehoiada bores a hole through a chest.61 But the qal can also be used in the meaning of "designate" or "summon by name" as in Isa 62:2 and Amos 6:1. In our passage, therefore, one could argue on the philological evidence alone that the man has either simply invoked the Name or has somehow "pierced" the Name. The second verb in v. 11, קלל, is clearer and indicates that the man somehow uses the Name in a curse. He may have tried to attack YHWH directly through magic; or perhaps he used YHWH's Name against Himself;62 or he may have There are a number of legal cases situated within the context of male fighting, cf. Exod 21:18-19; Exod 21:22; Deut 25:1-3; Deut 25:11-12. The definite marker is odd here and suggests that this may have been a person of some importance or centrality to the ancient writers. The primary discussion of this passage can be followed in a series of articles published in Fetus Testamentum since the 1960s. H.

Sank 56a suggests that the crime is cursing God Godself. Rashbam wrote: "He pronounced the Name and then he cursed." According to this interpretive tradition, mentioning the Name [35*]</page><page sequence="16">S. Tamar Kamionkowski tried to invoke YHWH in his cause against an Israelite.63 Jacob Weingreen argues that v. 11 implies that the problem did not reside in the naming (נקב) of the Name, but in the cursing (קלל). Hutton and others have rejected Weingreen's reading because v. 16 uses נקב in the sense of "pierce" or "curse." Hutton concludes that while the syntax of v. 11 is complex, נקב must imply some sense of cursing or taboo action. The most basic sense of v. 11 is that there were two distinct acts, naming and cursing. I believe that v. 16 was added to the story by H to prohibit the mention of the Name, because of its vulnerability. In other words, the H writers have taken this story from another source and added v. 16 to prohibit the mention of the Name and to warn Israelites about the seriousness of the offense. This seemingly misplaced narrative serves to enforce the theological arguments embedded in H legal material. Just as the Name can be desecrated by certain actions, so the Name can be pierced. In both cases, the Name is susceptible to Israel's actions and speech. Conclusions H understands holiness as the central relational principle between God and Israel. God identifies Godself as holy and the one who makes holy. People, places and things can also be holy and can make holy. Concurrently, people, places and things can have their holiness diminished, and God can have God's name diminished. H is centered around holiness as relationship between God and Israel, with both partners able to impact profoundly on the other. H never mentions God's כבוד. H is theologically interested in one particular aspect of God and designates that aspect as שם. In the כבוד system of P, טמאה can drive God out of the sanctuary as a matter of chemistry. For H, people's moral actions can also have an impact on God, but not upon God's כבוד. Unethical behavior, or certain wrongdoings can desecrate the שם of God. This is an aspect of God that can be directly affected by humanity. The כבוד cannot be directly desecrated. As we noted in Ezekiel 43, the כבוד is, the man figure delivers the message, and the שם is vulnerable to the acts of Israel. The שם is that part of God which has a more intimate relationship with humanity. The inclusion of the שם of God acknowledges God not just as a force residing within the sanctuary, but as a God in dynamic relationship with the people of Israel. The שם invoked by H is the priestly attempt to humanize God, perhaps in response to prophetic critique, as Knohl has convincingly argued.64 and general cursing are not at issue here. The crime is specifically cursing God by name. Cf. Livingston, "The Crime of Leviticus." See Erhard S. Gerstenberger, Leviticus: A Commentary (OTL; Louisville, Ky.: Westminster John Knox, 1996), 360-64. It is beyond the scope of this paper to consider any possible relationships between H's use of שם as a theological presentation and that of the Deuteronomistic Name Theology. [36*]</page><page sequence="17">Did the Priests Have a "Name" Theology? The centrality and vulnerability of God's שם in this priestly thinking develops to a new stage in Ezekiel 37. Influenced by the crisis of exile and a world in which the rise and fall of gods is mirrored by political highs and lows on the human plane, Ezekiel transforms H's notion of שם as that part of God that is accessible and impressible into a conception of that part of God that is concerned with reputation among the other nations. Ezekiel's understanding comes to play a dominant role in postbiblical interpretations of hillul hashem. This leads us to reconsider the meaning of holiness and God's name for the Holiness writers. It may be that שם was used as a sort of synecdoche, where שם indicated or represented the essential nature of God. This position is undoubtedly influenced by the common understanding of שם as summarized earlier in this essay. However, for the Holiness writers, שם is closer to a hypostasis or attribute of God rather than an indication of the essence of God. By hypostasis, I mean a quasi-personification of certain attributes proper to God. Helmer Ringgren further describes this phenomenon as "divine qualities split from their source of origin."65 More recently, Azzan Yadin and John T. Strong have drawn attention to S. Dean McBride's definition: "a quality, epithet, attribute, manifestation or the like of a deity which through a process of personification and differentiation has become a distinct (if not fully independent) divine being in its own right."66 Early Christianity and Judaism, especially the mystical traditions, acknowledge the inability of humanity to perceive God Godself, and use language of manifestation instead. Without equating Holiness School theology to that of its descendants hundreds of years later, I do believe that H was concerned with a particular aspect of God, termed שם, that was in direct relationship with Israel. Schwartz has argued, in his reading of the 2d person address of Lev 22:32, that the name of YHWH is the only holiness that Israelites are entitled to have a part of, so its desecration is the desecration of all other holiness that Israel can experience.67 Schwartz does not draw the same conclusions as I do, but he does imply that the name of YHWH is only one aspect of God—that aspect that is in relationship with Israel. I would suggest that it is the שם of God in the H writings that expresses that part of God which is in dynamic relationship with the community of Israel. And just as שם needs rethinking, so our understanding of קדש in H may also need some adjustment. Claude Geffre has argued that in addition to profane and holy, we Helmer Ringgren, Word and Wisdom: Studies in the Hypostatization of Divine Qualities in the Ancient Near East (Lund: Ohlssons, 1947), 190; John T. Strong, "God's Kabod: The Presence of Yahweh in the Book of Ezekiel," in The Book of Ezekiel: Theological and Anthropological Perspectives (ed. Margaret S. Odell and John T. Strong; SBL SymS 9; Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2000), 69-96. As quoted by Yadin, "קול as Hypostasis in the Hebrew Bible," 601. Schwartz, The Holiness Legislation, 309. [37*]</page><page sequence="18">S. Tamar Kamionk.owsk.1 ought to add the category of the divine—that which is beyond holy.68 Although I do not agree with his full argument, there is something to be said for differentiating the divine from the holy and recognizing that holiness has meaning only in the context of relationship between the divine and the human.69 This rethinking enables us to think of קדש in H as a relational quality, as that which binds God and Israel, and as that which is malleable, flexible and potentially in flux. If my conclusions are correct regarding TPs attitude toward holiness and God, it would suggest a highly sophisticated modality of thinking in which it was understood that one's sense of God's presence may be diminished when one fails to meet her or his obligations. In conclusion, the contrast between H dynamic and P static holiness has been argued brilliantly by Jacob Milgrom, Israel Knohl and others. What I hope I have been able to contribute is how the phrase X לחלל את שם plays into that priestly debate. X לחלל את שם is a loaded theological expression, conveying the idea that people can have a direct impact on God (that is, their experience of God), diminishing his holiness through improper cultic actions and unethical behavior. Conversely, people can expand God's holiness and their own holiness through proper action. Claude Geffre, "Le Christianisme et les metamorphoses du sacre," in Le Sacre: Etudes et recherches (ed. Enrico Castelli; Paris: Aubier, 1974), 133-50. Cited in Amorim, Desecration and Defilement, 199. William Robertson Smith, in The Religion of the Semites: The Fundamental Institutions (London: Black, 1894), 141-42, suggests that holiness is localized, that "the idea of holiness comes into prominence wherever the gods come into touch with men..."
