<plain_text><page sequence="1">rones Of the chas Afro-Cuban Altars in New Jersey, New York, and Havana DAVID H. BROWN To make Santo is to make a king, and kariocha [initiation] is a ceremony of kings, like those of the palace of the Oba Lucumi [Yoruba king]. (Calixta Morales, priestess Oddedei, in Cabrera 1983b:24 fn.) [In my work] I favor the Louis XV style...in fact, all the Louises. (priest/throne maker Ram6n Esquiv4l, May 12, 1987) We can no longer speak of tradition in terms of the approximate identity of some objective thing that changes while remaining the same. Instead, we must understand tradition as a symbolic process that both presup- poses past symbolisms and creatively reinterprets them. (Handler &amp; Linnekin 1984:287) hrones of the orichas-special altars for Afro-Cuban deities of Yoruba origin-are often huge, stunning installations. Composed of colorful cloth, porcelain vessels, and beadwork objects, they rise above bountiful spreads of fresh fruit, flowers, and plates of pre- pared foods. Wherever important ritual events take place-in western Cuba, South Florida, New York, New Jersey, California, Puerto Rico, Venezuela- thrones preside as commanding pres- ences in practitioners' homes. Priests (santeros) of the religion popularly known as Santeria, La Regla de Ocha, or La Regla Lucumil double as artists, or rely upon specialized throne makers, to construct temporary altar installations that please and honor the orichas, im- press congregations, and play focal roles in sacred performance. Curiously, these thrones have received little more than a half-dozen pages of superficial description in all the scholarly literature on Afro-Cuban religion com- bined (Cabrera 1980:176-79;. Brandon 1983:400-42; Drewal 1989b:22-25). Only recently has this important art form been given public exposure in several small exhibitions of thrones built by priests and as a series of reflections by contemporary artists.2 As this is the first article devoted solely to the subject, I will describe and interpret recently documented examples in the United States and Cuba, and then locate the throne form in a broader eth- nohistorical context. Reworked transat- lantic ritual object types and familiar Yoruba iconography, previously studied in isolation, are seen to crystallize in a uniquely New World altar form that emerged in Cuba, later to be elaborated in the United States among Cuban mi- grants. Analysis of the throne form reveals much about emergent Diasporic art history and culture and provides fer- tile ground for a theoretical critique of processes hitherto characterized by the terms "continuity and change," "syn- cretism," and "creolization." Thrones are built to honor and for- mally present one or more deities, inter- changeably called orichas or santos, of the Lucumi pantheon. The orichas, deriving ultimately from the major brish of Yorubaland, are customarily adorned as powerful royal presences, with splendid clothwork, costume, and iconographic attributes. If, as priestess Oddedei de- clared to Lydia Cabrera in 1954 (Cabrera 1983b:24 fn.), the kariocha initiation ritual "is a ceremony of kings" as found in Africa, how is it that it came to be ex- pressed with a system of signs and aes- thetic preferences that derive apparently from European aristocracy? How is it that a premier black Cuban altar maker and priest of Obatala, the late Ram6n Esquivel, "favor[ed] the Louis XV style" in his worship of Yoruba-derived deities, and that this style is widely regarded among Cuban practitioners as wholly traditional? More generally, how does one approach the question of the Africanity of Lucumi religion? In an art history of Lucumi religious objects for orichas of apparent Yoruba provenance, what weight and attention are placed on Yoruba "origins" in understanding Afro-Cuban iconography and meaning? In short, what are the assumptions behind the notion of "tradition" in gener- al and "Yoruba tradition in the New World" in particular? As domestic altars, constructed in practi- tioner's homes which double as "houses of ocha" (houses of oricha worship),3 thrones provide a sacred portal for sup- plicants to approach, salute, praise, com- municate with, and make offerings to the orichas. Yet thrones are creations distinct from the permanent shrines found in those same homes. Thrones are tempo- rary installations, whose scale often requires reallocation of domestic space, and whose duration as an assemblage is 1.

Shaped cloth squares (patios) represent other deities (orichas): at left, Yemaya; at right, Ochun; and above, Obatala. The cloth cover- ing the centered and elevated vessel of Chang6 is shaped to form a thunder axe, and the triangles formed by the translucent red curtain panels flanking Obatala also suggest Chang6's thunder axe.

Thrones employ a basic dominant form: an installation of colorful cloth cre- ating a canopy overhead, a curtain back- drop behind, and symmetrically parted and tied-back curtains in front-either independent hanging curtains or the suggestion of them in swags of cloth sta- pled to the wall. The throne's canopy may form the hypotenuse of two con- verging walls, it may project straight out from a long single wall, or it may even span the entirety of one end of a narrow room. The construction recalls a minia- ture proscenium stage or an elaborately curtained picture window. Yet it recalls more precisely the baldachinss of Euro- pean royal thrones, church and domes- tic Catholic altars, whose architecture and imagery historically incorporated throne references, and state beds. The enclosure radiates the identify- ing colors of the oricha of honor. Squares of cloth called pafios, color coded to a set of companion orichas, punctuate the throne enclosure itself in artistically gathered or pinned configurations, or lie draped over elevated oricha vessels con- taining the deity's "secrets," atop which are placed the appropriate iconographic attributes in beadwork and metalwork. I encountered three main throne con- figurations keyed to functionally distinct _ iI .` .. .4i~r ? ? ,.l 's ..: 2 :."!iS}+ ritual events in houses in New York, New Jersey, Miami, Havana, and Matanzas: thrones built for initiation (asiento), for a "saint's birthday" (cumpleahios), and for sacred "drummings" (tambores).6 Initiation Thrones The initiation throne, or trono del asiento (Fig. 2), consists of three basic visible elements: the canopy of cloth, which may be more or less elaborate; a sa- cred mortar (pil6n in Spanish, odd6 in Lucumi) on which the initiate (iyawd) may sit; and a reed floormat (estera). Completed the night before the initia- tion, the throne stands for seven days (often Friday to Friday), and is taken down when the newly made priest leaves liminal seclusion for "reincor- poration" into the community on the "Day of the Plaza" (Market Day).7 The asiento is centrally about the cre- ation of a new earthly locus of oricha power-that is, the establishment of a shrine-and the parallel birth of a new generation of priesthood to serve and channel that power for human benefit. Asiento refers to the "seating" of spiritual power, ache, in the material world (aye). The ceremony is also called the "corona- tion," an expression that captures the momentousness of the ritual process of "putting ache on the head" (kariocha in Lucumi). On the first day (Day of the Asiento), in the igbodan, the initiate is seated upon the pil6n as the oricha is "crowned" or "seated" upon the top of the head in a series of secret and guarded procedures. Consistent with the idiom of coronation, the oricha is often spoken of as "my crown," a spiritual head that gov- erns, but also confers priestly authority upon, its human servant, a relationship nicely encapsulated by the Lucumi proverb "The head rules the body." Having been crowned atop the pil6n but outside the throne's domain, the iyaw6 is then installed in the throne and spends that night and the next five nights sleep- ing under its protective canopy. The asiento throne may be seen to play three metaphorical roles vis-a-vis the initiate, whose name, iyaw6, trans- lates as "bride of the oricha": it is a royal throne for a "new king"; a marriage bed for a new bride and oricha; and a con- tainer that protects the vulnerable new- born priest from destructive spiritual influences. Not least, the throne plays the symbolic role of "house" or seclu- 2. Initiation throne (trono del asiento), made by Antonio Queiro for exhibition at the Caribbean Cultural Center, New York, 1984.

An asiento throne constructed for exhibi- tion purposes at the Caribbean Cultural Center. in New York in 1984 (Fig. 2) is predominantly white, reflecting the cen- tral role of Obatala as the guardian angel. Three draped, shaped, and pinned pailos punctuate the curtained front, and one the quilted background: yellow for Ochtin, blue bordered in white for Yemaya, red for Chang6 (and probably Oya),9 and at top center, white lace adorned with a dove figure with out- spread wings for Obatala. The maker10 symmetrically balanced the pailos for two intimately related female orichas, Yemaya and Ochuin, and placed the bold red diamond for Chang6 at rear cen- ter-all representing the orichas to be "received" by the iyaw6, in addition to the governing guardian angel Obatalai "made" by the iyaw6.11 These lightly floating cloth forms hover about the cen- 7wi :_ : N;5--ri t.A _; jr ~ -c.;-. 1 tral space as a kind of supporting cast to the guardian angel's lead. On the second day in the igbodzin, the Dia del Medio (Middle Day), the initiate is publicly presented in the early after- noon to the community. The iyaw6, under the immediate influence of the "newly born" oricha/santo-referred to as a "new king" or "new queen"-dons elaborate garments called ropa de santo (clothes of the saint) or traje de medio (suit of the middle day) and appears under the canopied asiento throne to receive humble submissions and greet- ings from family and visitors. The iyaw6 may stand, sit upon the pil6n, make prone submissions to the floor to salute elders, or else sit on the mat, as the moment demands. The "secrets," orfun- damentos (foundation), of the orichas made and received the previous day are contained in a variety of covered vessels called soperas, arrayed in an orderly line on the floor alongside the throne's mat or elsewhere in the igbodzin. Thus, in a real sense, the asiento throne as a complete altar consists not only of the canopy and the pil6n--which has been consecrated like any other sacred oricha object-but also the ritually pre- pared, dressed, and iconographically outfitted body of the iyaw6, who is noth- ing less than a living altar. Formal Garments of the Orichas Initiates who make Obatala, Yemaya, Oya, Chang6, and Ochin are dressed as crowned palace royalty reposing under lavish cloth thrones of satin, velvet, lame, and lace (Fig. 6). Their ropa de santo ensembles include shimmering paste- board crowns encrusted with cowries and iconographic details. The warriors (guerreros) Elegua, Ogutn, and Och6si, by contrast, are most frequently figured as october 1993 47</page><page sequence="5">? .. ,-/ -. ? . , ....?...:.. .-., F ?. ":.~I~ L .% ... ... -,..

They sit not upon a lathe-turned wood pil6n but upon a large, often jagged, heavy stone (piedra) brought from their outside domains. Presented on the Dia del Medio under the leafy throne in the igbodan, each guerrero also owns a paral- lel throne of leaves constructed outside the house (trono del patio) where impor- tant rituals of the asiento were per- formed. In other words, their particular spiritual power is not wholly containable within the house or the "town." Formally dressed iyaw6s carry the appropriate dance wand or staff used by their oricha. Flywhisks (rabo) accompany the outfits of Obatala and Oya; fans (dbanico) are carried by Yemaya and Ochiin; a thunder axe (hacha) is held by Chang6.13 Instead of refined implements of palace royalty or aristocracy, the guer- reros carry rustic and fierce implements of work, war, and hunting: a cutlass (machete) for Ogiin, a hooked staff (gara- bato) for Elegua, and a bow and arrow (arco-y-flecha) for Och6si. Although the form and function of these impressive dance wands and other attributes may be interpreted as Yoruba derived, they have been creatively re- worked in an Afro-Cuban idiom. For example, the red and black bead-wrapped hooked staff (garabato) of the Afro-Cuban EleguA reconstitutes the Yoruba Elegba's figurated phallic club (ogo-elegba).14 Fashioned from the guava tree sacred to that deity, the garabato is adapted from the rural Cuban field tool used by farmers 5. Birthday throne for the Chang6 of the late priest Adolfo Fernandez, designed by Ram6n Esquivel in 1985. This throne, composed of lace, satin, velvet, and lame, celebrates the anni- versary of the priest's coronation. Orichas are contained in covered vessels (soperas) on ped- estals, draped with luxurious cloth. Obatala is represented in white double peaks above the red-and-white Chang6, the crown of Dada descends from the canopy, and the cloth-cov- ered soperas of other orichas are arrayed below, from left: Ochun, Agayu with Ibeyis atop him, Chang6, Yemaya (Obba behind in the cor- ner), Oyi.

For example, the red and black rooster feathers of Elegua's hat and the male goat hide used for his bag come from sacrificial animals used to feed the deity (interview, Lourdes L6pez, Feb. 21, 1987). The hat's straw and the guava wood are rooted in the earthly landscape he inhabits. Most important, dance wands, when carried, are exten- sions of the orichas' potential for ac- tion-what it is the deities do-or more specifically how, when properly invoked, they can transform the world (see Drewal 1989:208, 223-29). Complementing the impressively orchestrated textures and colors of expensive-looking fabrics, modeled on aristocratic styles, are Yoruba-derived color-coded bracelets and sashes in metal and beadwork. Iyaw6s wear on the left wrist a multistrand beaded bracelet (ide) in the colors of their dngel de guarda; and up to four groups of metal bracelets may be divided between the two wrists, depending upon the oricha made: silver dedicated to Yemaya and Obatala, cop- per to Oya, and brass to OchTin.16 Oricha Beadwork Beaded necklaces and sashes complete the iyaw6's Middle Day ensemble. The iyaw6 wears at least five consecrated oricha bead necklaces received at an earli- er level of initiation. But more prominent, on the occasion of the Middle Day, are the collares de mazo (literally bunch or bundle of bead strands), which are sad- dled around the body (Fig. 3).17 At least five mazos are draped diagonally across the iyaw6's chest in two directions, form- ing an X. Each mazo can weigh as much as three pounds and consist of over 12,000 glass, ceramic, and plastic beads.18 The iyaw6 wears one mazo for each of the 48 african arts</page><page sequence="6">orichas made and received. Painstakingly made by hand, collares de mazo consist of multiple strands of beads organized on the basis of an oricha's oracular number and set of counterpointed sacred colors. The thick circle is subdivided into equi- distant segments by large, decorative fas- tening beads called glorias. In turn, emanating octopus-like, from each main gloria, are multistrand tassels called mofias (knots/ties), one of which, the moia prin- cipal (principal knot), is the most worked and elaborate. The number of segments, the number of strands in the bunch mak- ing up the segments, the numbered pat- tern of beads on each strand, and the number of main glorias with attached mohias are based on the orichas' oracular numbers or multiples thereof.19 The mazos, like crossed bandoliers over the ropa de santo, proudly identify the iyaw6 as a newly consecrated living locus of the orichas' achd. The beauty and sheer prodigiousness of the mazo signifies wealth, prerogative, and divine authori- ty in a way consistent with cascading cowries and beadwork among the Yoruba (Thompson 1970:8).20 At the same time, one suspects that the collar de mazo was creatively reconstituted in the New World in dialogue with the model of the rosary. The Catholic necklace is mnemon- ically and numerically organized in seg- ments of ten smaller beads devoted to the Ave Maria prayer, punctuated by larger glorias and Padre Nuestros; it fea- tures a depending crucifix whose promi- nence can be seen to mirror the mofia principal of the mazo (Centro del Rosario n.d; and Brazilian examples in Gleason 1987:241-43). However, the comparison is limited, as the mazos radically differ in scale, weight, complexity, and function. At another register of meaning, mazos in their specific ritual context come to mark boldly and bodily the claims par- ticular orichas have made upon the initi- ate's "head." In their life as objects, mazos may be activated as spiritual las- sos by ritual elders, and by orichas when they possess their priests, to ensnare the bodies of those marked for initiation (a dramatic move called la prendici6n).21 Finally the mazos' physical encirclement delineates and reinforces an envelope of spiritual containment or embodiment. Formally worn in concert with ropa de santo on only two occasions in the life of a priest, the Dia del Medio and the pre- sentaci6n al tambor (presentation to the drums),22 the mazos remain, for the rest of the priest's life, draped around the orichas' soperas (Fig. 4) or temporarily upon festival thrones. Thus, the mazo- encircled body may be seen as an analog to the vessels containing the orichas' achi.23 And at festival time body and ves- sels are "dressed" formally with cloth to identify and mark oricha presence. Owing to the architectural role cloth can play, the trono del asiento effects a : " I z U.. ? 0 :3ll i-i 0 0 cc "break" in significant space (to use Mircea Eliade's terms), defining a sphere of the oricha's immediate presence and implying the oricha's direct influence and claim upon the individual under it. For Eliade it would constitute a "sacred" space carved out of the surrounding "homogenous" "profane" world (1959:20). Ritually "set apart" by articulated bound- aries and prohibitions (see Douglas 1978: chaps. 2, 3), the throne protects the iyaw6 from the potentially dangerous influ- ences carried by disincarnated spirits, eguns. At the same time, the uninitiated visitor who intentionally or accidentally crosses the proscenium into the throne's canopied space is subject to the immedi- ate and irrevocable grasp of the oricha. That is, the individual must surrender his or her "head" to the santo, i.e., the reli- gion: initiation is imminent. The person is encircled immediately with a collar de mazo and instructed to get initiated as soon as possible. The seized mazo-wearer sooner or later finds him- or herself under the throne on the Dia del Medio, dressed in ropa de santo and encircled with five mazos. The construction of the throne also effects a break in time, constituting a ritu- al or festival period, as the appearance of royal cloth registers and heralds the immediate or imminent manifestation of oricha. On the same principle, the wearers of ropa de santo step into a public ritual role for a defined period as the "mounts" of the deity they serve. "What is impor- tant about the dressing of the orisha here 6.

"The new dressing signifies that it is an orisha who is occupying his mount's body and participating in the event" (Friedman 1982:194). Ropa de santo, and the bolts of cloth and patios which comprise the throne, belong exclusively to the oricha and may not be worn, displayed, or otherwise used except on ritual occasions.24 If the cloth is understood to identify or repre- sent iconographically particular orichas through a system of color coding, it should also be seen, in more dynamic terms, as actively constitutive of, and materially coextensive in space and time with, embodied oricha presence in the world. Indeed, as Ochiin priest Ysamur Flores has written, the ropa de santo "cre- ates the orisha in the body of the initiate" (Flores 1990:47). In other words, cloth may evoke oricha qualities and serves in the invocation of spiritual power, as Henry Drewal, John Pemberton, and Rowland Abiodun (1989) and Margaret Drewal (1989) understand representation in Yoruba sacred arts. Artistic representa- tions not only "acknowledge supernatu- ral forces and events"; in concert with oral praises, music, and dance, they october 1993 49</page><page sequence="7">"more importantly evoke, invoke, and activate diverse forces, to marshal and bring them into the phenomenal world" (Drewal, Pemberton &amp; Abiodun 1989:16). Birthday Thrones and Drumming Thrones While the trono del asiento (initiation throne) serves to publicly present and protect the newly crowned iyaw6, the trono del cumpleahios (birthday throne) presents formally, as a dramatic array, all of the priest's orichas themselves (Figs. 5, 10), which have remained in covered ves- sels and confined in their permanent shrine during the year, most often a set of shelves or a closed cabinet (canastillero). The canastillero is the historically pre- ferred and probably most convenient form of domestic shrine or altar form developed by Afro-Cuban practitioners of Lucumi religion. It supports covered ves- sels-the soperas-hierarchically ordered on shelves and surrounded by their bead- ed attributes, accumulated decorative gifts, and, very often, the ebos (sacrifices) of ongoing ritual activity in the house (see Fig. 8 and Gonzalez Huguet 1968:34, 48-49; Cabrera 1983b:plates). The orichas' soperas, although adorned with their mazos and attributes, are not dressed in cloth pailos until festival time: drummings (tambores) and birthdays (cumpleahios). The cumpleafios throne is erected for the annual oricha's "birthday," that is, the anniversary of a priest's coronation and the birth of his or her "crown." It is a serious, beautiful petition, weighted with wishes for the well-being of the priest who is entering a new year in ritual age (i.e., seniority). Each year's birthday throne for active priests registers new additions to the , Z - - IP r r .......1 111 PTDDHR :%;ir i; " :? i PHOTO:~~~ DAIDH.BRW original group of orichas, as auxiliary pro- tectors called addima-orichas are incre- mentally "received."25 Birthday thrones thus inscribe aesthetically a kind of emer- gent spiritual biography marking a priest's growth in santo. At the same time, active priests regularly create new beaded and cloth objects for their own orichas or as gifts to orichas of ritual kin, registered annually on the throne in an ever grow- ing accumulation of beautiful attributes. Each time the orichas are presented for- mally their stature and iconographic rich- ness appear more expansive, with new objects that tell stories and reflect not only upon the grandeur of the deity but also upon the well-being of the house, its owner, and the ritual family of "godchil- dren" (ahijados) the latter has initiated.26 Modeled on the general outlines of the trono del asiento, the birthday throne's canopy is erected over spreading straw mats. The orichas' soperas are arranged on pedestals so that the original group of orichas made and received in the initiation is usually clustered together centrally, while the addima-orichas arc outward toward the two extremes. Consistent with the ranking of orichas in their multishelved canastilleros, the houses studied here always placed the arch-divinity Obatala centrally, in a position of absolute ascendance, fol- lowed by the priest's dngel de guarda (if it is not already Obatala), followed by the second parent-oricha.27 A trono del tambor is erected for a drumming celebration (tambor). The main formal difference between a trono del cumpleatios and a trono del tambor is that the former presents the vessels of all the orichas a priest has received, while the latter usually presents only the oricha of honor (i.e., the oricha to whom the cele- bration is given) and Elegui, who, along with his companion guerreros, must take part in all ritual events; it is they who "clear the way" for the success of any undertaking. In a throne for a 1983 drum- ming to Chang6, only the envesseled secrets of this deity are elevated at center stage, along with the guerreros nestled directly below; however, cloth patios rep- resenting other key orichas-in this case ObatalA, Och6in, and Yemayb-are ar- ranged in an outer constellation of silver, gold, and blue and white respectively (Fig. 1).28 The cumpleafios is held every 8.

They receive a sumptuous spread of fruit and sweets, and special tributes (derechos) of coconuts, candles, and money, from godchildren who gath- er in the house of their godfather (padri- no) or godmother (madrina) to celebrate. Bolts of cloth of silk brocade, sequins, velvet, lace, lame, satin, and chiffon, carefully selected for the colors, textures, and patterns associated with particular orichas, are purchased in wholesale tex- tile stores (in Manhattan, for example, in the Garment District and on Delancy Street). Cut and fitted with sparkling contrasting borders of silver and gold braid, and often adorned with cowrie shells, they become pafRos to dress and cover the orichas' soperas. The most desir- able fabrics have printed or brocaded floral sprays with flecks or threads of metallic silver or gold, or else they are densely sequined. Over the pailo the oricha's mazo can be doubled to encircle the now-covered sopera, or draped sash-style. Crowns (a nine-pointed copper one for Oya, a five-pointed brass one for Och6n3O) are then placed on top, their dangling attributes radiating out from the cen- ter.31 In order "to make it beautiful," says Josie Garcia, the top of the pafo is carefully coaxed up through the crown, or pinched and tied if there is no crown, to form a puffy navel or head that she likens to a "bun" (interview, May 21, 1988)(Figs. 9-11). Finally the appro- priate beaded or painted staffs, dance wands, or other symbolically resonant attributes owned by the oricha are placed on top or slipped through the mazo, or nestled nearby against the wall (Fig. 11).32 The result poses the finely dressed orichas like a glorious assembled theatrical cast at a curtain call or, more precisely, like royalty sitting in state. Offerings for the Orichas Orichas mounted on birthday and drum- ming thrones, as well as those newly born orichas reposing on the floor of the igbodan on the final day of the initiation period, find a selection of cool (fresco) and sweet (dulce) fruits and foods arranged before them. This array is called plaza, a term which here simply means a bountiful "spread" of food, but which, in a related context, refers to an open-air marketplace (interviews, Melba Carillo and Beatriz Morales, Sept. 9, 1993). The plaza is said to refresh (refrescar) them PHOTO DAVID H BOWN before they are addressed through div- ination with four shards of coconut meat (obi). That which is cool, refreshing, and sweet should produce a disposition con- ducive to positive divinatory responses and is metaphorically consistent with the desired result: tranquility, advancement, health, and well-being. The aesthetic choices of the plaza are guided by oricha categories and charac- teristics, in which shape, color, texture, and even taste are taken into account.33 Creative throne makers engage in a kind of intimate landscaping. Ochuin, for example, receives fruits of her charac- teristic color and sweetness: mangos, oranges, and grapefruits, as well as "Spanish pumpkins" (calabazas), which suggest the contours of the female ab- domen. Chang6 receives bananas and plantains (for their phallic shape), and strawberries and apples (for their red and white color); Obatala receives Anjou pears, whose light exterior and white interior correspond to his color, while their shape approximates the conical mountain where he lives. Other matches are not as easily explained but are never- theless traditional: Oya receives egg- plants (berenjenas), whose dark color appears to reproduce the shades of the robes of St. Theresa and Our Lady of Candlemas with whom Oya is associat- ed; Elegua, Oguin, and Och6si prefer sugar cane (cala de azacar), perhaps because of its association with the "out- side" (the fields) and the aggressive cane-cutting/ground-clearing wielders of machetes (Ogin in particular).34 Particular kinds of fruits are placed before or near particular orichas, often creatively distributed in symbolically significant configurations and eye-pop- ping alternations of color echoing the counterpoint of oricha beadwork.

The paper fan and peacock feathers are attributes of the deity. Union City, New Jersey, 1987. 1986 birthday throne to her Och6in (Fig. 10), Josie Garcia of the Bronx spread a central circle of five pineapples (the number five being sacred to Ochuin) alternated with four small calabazas, in the middle of which rested a large cal- abaza. These pumpkins were doused with honey and sprinkled with sweet, multicolored jimmies. In a 1983 throne for Chang6 (Fig. 1), Ram6n Esquivel arranged Delicious apples on the mat into the shape of the deity's double thunder axe, whose twin points sprout- ed from a bunch of bananas. Elaborate plazas also feature a host of home-prepared and purchased desserts and snacks. Elegua loves hard candies (caramelas) and popcorn (rositas de maiz). Och6n gets dulces finos (syrup-soaked yellow cakes) and natilla con canela (sweet egg custard with cinnamon). Obatala takes arroz con leche (rice pudding, but unsweetened), white rolls and merengues (swirled puffs of white sugar) in multi- ples of eight and a large, conical "tower" (torre) of merengue that represents the white, heavenly mountain upon which he lives. Yemaya likes coco dulce, made of grated coconut with brown sugar and melao (molasses or dark cane syrup), and also often receives mala-rabia and boniatil- lo, sweet potatoes (boniato) blended to be chunky and smooth, respectively. Oya receives a dish of chocolate pudding, really a custard of the same base as Och6n's natilla with chocolate added. Chang6 is served amald-ild (cornmeal and okra) (interviews, Melba Carillo, 1987 and Aug. 1993). The prize of the pre- pared sweets is a large frosted birthday cake featuring the oricha of honor's name. After a period of time on the mat as offer- ings to the oricha, pieces of the cake and the rest of the throne's fruits are distrib- uted back to birthday guests. Oricha Thronescapes35 Throne makers like the masterful Ram6n Esquiv"l employ cloth as a plastic medi- um to create thrones that dramatically announce oricha presence through their signature colors, that reference architec- ture and the sacralized natural landscape, and that inscribe a hierarchical model of the cosmos. The oricha of honor customar- ily is elevated and centralized, fronted by Elegub upon the mat and transcended by ObatalA above. Elegub is always placed on the floor in the center, near where priests make their prone salutations (moforibale) and deposit a monetary trib- ute (derecho) in the calabash (jicara) on the october 1993 51</page><page sequence="9">mat (Figs. 1, 5, 10). He is the guardiero (guardian) of crossroads, thresholds, mar- ketplace, and house; the diminutive "messenger" who ferries communications and sacrifices to other orichas; the oricha addressed, fed, and assuaged before all others. He thus stands guard with the other guerreros before the orichas elevated behind him, at a kind of threshold or crossroads that links them with the throne's human supplicants. Fruits and foods as products of the earth distributed on mats of straw find direct vertical opposition in the rising celestial canopy, often made of sheer white fabric, lace or crepe, suggesting clouds in the sky and rising mountains (Fig. 5). This is the sphere of ObatalA, sky oricha and pure "King of the White Cloth." In a 1983 drumming throne for Chang6 (Fig. 1), behind the sheer red curtains joined at the apex by the silver lame "shield" of ObatalA, white moun- tain peaks rise above the horizontal bar spanning the two converging walls, while bunted lace "clouds" depend below. Beneath this firmament in cloth, the striking pailos and the covered, ele- vated vessel of Chang6 are set against against the blazon-like dominant back- ground of alternating vertical pillars of red and white bolts of cloth, forming the counterpointed signature colors of Chang6, the oricha of honor. In a 1985 birthday throne for Chang6 (Fig. 5), Ram6n Esquivel shaped the sil- ver and white brocade pailos covering the soperas of two Obatalas to form dou- ble peaks, referencing the deity's myth- ological residence, the "hill of Oke," that towers above all of the other orichas (interview, Ram6n Esquivl, Aug. 17, 1986). Oke is Obatala's faithful companion oricha, his rock-solid sup- port or "staff" (bast6n) (interview, Melba Carillo, Nov. 14, 1987; see also Angarica n.d:21). Thus Esquiv6l rendered in his thronescape not only a hierarchicalized landscape of sky and earth but also an understanding of Obatala-who, by rights, is "higher" than the other deities presented-as the spiritual "head of all the orichas." ObatalA crowned atop the "hill" bridges and mediates "sky" and "earth," playing the axis mundi role to which Eliade refers (1959:36-37). In a marvelous instance of cultural bricolage, Esquivil mounted on the wall an elaborate golden spoked metal lamp in the form of the monstrance of the Host, the Christian God's Holy Sacra- ment (Santissimo Sacramento). The lamp, with bulbs of different colors, rises just above and behind the twin peaks of ObatalA. A priest fleshed out the sense of this striking juxtaposition in an expla- nation to me of an ObatalA drumming throne that Esquiv4l made for him. The throne's central upward-aspiring white and silver pafio was an "airplane going to heaven...you know, height!, like some- thing that looks toward the sky. Because Obatala, is, you know, God's son. Like Jesus, ObatalA is like Jesus. It's like something [going] to his father, very symbolic...to open the ways to Heav- en from Earth" (interview, Idalberto Cardenas, Nov. 29, 1986). Thus the spiritual landscape as in- scribed in throne architecture suggests something of a reconciliation of Yoruba and Western Christian cosmology based, undoubtedly, in a historically emergent Cuban and Latino popular religious conception. Yet though the throne presents an image structured by a Western spirit-matter hierarchy of "heaven" and "earth," heaven is not at all a distant or otherworldly one as in certain Christian conceptions. Reflecting its foundation as an African-derived shrine, the throne-as-altar embodies spiritual power in envesseled earthly material objects, a power manifested in an immediate, intimate, and voluptuous way, right here, amid an otherwise mundane domestic domain. These same canopies that structure vertical mediations between "sky" and "earth" provide the dramatic stage for some of Esquiv6l's most powerful and large-scale evocations of the thunder god Chang6 and his oricha "sister" Dada, who is known in Cuba as the "crown of the Saints" (Angarica n.d.:45-49). In the 1985 birthday throne Esquivel built for Chan- g6 (Fig. 5), the magnificent beaded and cowrie-encrusted crown of Dada de- scends from the canopy on clustered strands of red and white beads and cowries.36 Hovering above the covered vessel and pedestal of Chang6, its twelve long cowrie-studded fringes dangle beneath it and encircle a red and gold flo- ral patio, atop which are arranged Chang6's beaded thunder axe (oched), beaded baseball bat (bate),37 and collares de mazo. In Yorubaland the prototype of the New World version of the crown is worn by special priests of Shang6 called to pay homage to their thunder god when houses are struck by lightning (Abraham 1946:121, 622).38 Here the descending crown of DadA appears as the very embodiment of Chang6's light- ning (his achei) arcing from sky to ground, condensing in the beaded attributes of Chang6 and the covered vessel that con- tains his thunderstones (edun ard). Esquivdl echoed lightning's descent with the vertical chevron pattern of sequins embroidered across the surface of the patio itself. As if that were not enough, Esquivel shaped the pailo further by draping and tacking its upper edge in the form of zigzagged horns, evocations of lightning and of the ox horns that repre- sent Chang6's companion-oricha Oggue. In a stunning repeat performance in 1987 (Fig. 12), Esquiv4l shaped the same red and gold paiio into repeating dia- mond-shaped lightning bolts falling downward beside the uncovered vessel (batea) and pedestal (pil6n) of Chang6. Having seen, in 1986, photographs of decoratively painted Chang6 vessels and pedestals on display in a Havana muse- um, he decided to reconstitute this tradi- tion in the United States.39 Numerous other possibilities exist for employing throne curtains and pailos iconographically. Esquivel and other throne makers shape cloth creatively as flowers and butterflies for the feminine water orichas YemayA and Ochi6n (Figs. 2, 10) and thunder axes for Chang6 (Fig. 10). Esquivel's 1983 drumming throne for Chang6 (Fig. 1) features a fiery red pailo crackling with gold sequins, shaped to the form of the oricha's double thun- der axe at the center of the throne. Most dramatically, the front curtains are part- ed sharply so that the two opposing tri- angular areas of sheer red cloth appear to compose a huge overarching double thunder axe. The 1986 birthday throne built by Josie Garcia for her Ochuin expands the possibilities of rendering cosmology in cloth, as it reorients a more strictly hier- archicalized sky/earth landscape into underwaterscape (Fig. 10). And it sug- gests a fluid reinscription of aesthetic emphases around the values of the cult of Och6n. While ObatalA still sits ascen- dant, he is dominated by Ochuin's colors; there is no sky or mountain range ren- dered in puffy white lace or crepe. The canopy was, in fact, conceived by Josie Garcia as a running river's surface as seen from below, for the throne maker understands her particular manifestation, or "road," of Ochuin as having "lived in a river in a cave." The dominant colors are "honey" and gold, representing all of Ochuin's "sweet things," especially the "sweet water" of the river she "owns." The canopy's lacy gold border glistens and bubbles; its gold dimpled ceiling suggests running rapids; its pleated verti- cal drapes at left and right are like water lapping riverbanks. The gentle curves of the central butterfly shape-a beautiful avatar of the female oricha Ochiin--dou- ble as a figure of emanating, concentric "waves," as its maker explained (inter- view, Josie Garcia, May 16, 1986). Pea- cock feathers, from one of Och6n's central avatars, adorn the outer drapes as well as Ochin's central patio. Layered in with these references to Och6n's sweet things are the counterpointed bead colors of this Och6n: the alternating vertical bars of amber and green. (This road of Ochiin employs green because of her intimate association with Orunmila, whose colors are yellow and green.) The meaning of the throne and its objects is not exhausted by an account of its iconography, not least because most of its constituents are quite abstract.

The golds and "honey" colors identify this oricha of "sweet water" (the river). Obatala is above Ochun in the center. To Ochun's left are Olokun, Kofa de Orula, and Yemaya, with the twins Ibeyi (represented by dolls). Warrior orichas appear in front. To the right of Ochun are Agayu, Oya, and Chang6. At the top, a red pafio is shaped like Chang6's thunder axe. The beaded mazos were made by Melba Carillo. New York, 1986. 11.

A hierarchy and differentiation of aes- thetic density-the lavishness of cloth, decorative embellishment, and concen- tration of gathered objects-throws into relief the paio-covered oricha vessels against the dominant areas of the throne itself. It is certainly the pafos, with their rich gold and silver fabrics, that appear most expensive.

The effect echoes Judith Gleason's observa- tions of Yoruba Egungun masquerades and suggests something of a transatlantic tradition of sacred clothwork. The mas- querades use "a dramatizing of the sur- faces in order to stress the depth of what is thereby concealed. The delighted eye october 1993 53</page><page sequence="11">teases the mind to contemplation of the unseen force behind the apparition" (Gleason 1987:102). The crowns and globe-like gatherings of cloth rise like heads atop a conical body draped with beads. Dance wands or other hand-held attributes sprout atop them. The assemblage is at once readable as hierarchical and anthropomorphic on the one hand, and as a discontinuous, additive, metonymic clustering of forms on the other. Robert Plant Armstrong has referred to this latter additive aesthetic formation as a process of "syndesis," in which the intentional addition and piling up of forms, including material objects, songs, praises, and sacrifices, serve to invoke and sustain "presence"-in this case oricha power, achg-for particular rit- ual applications and passages (Arm- strong 1981).41 If the mound is a kind of body, a "grammatically animate" (Jackson 1989:144) body that "stores" ache" (Apter 1987:246-47), diacritically distin- guished by its attributes from its neigh- bor, it is both similar to and distinct from the more clearly hierarchically organized, kinetically animate body of the priest whose body may be possessed and danced by the oricha.42 Finally, while the throne is accessible in this extended moment for visual con- templation, an effect heightened by its objectification in a photograph, the pro- cess of the accumulation of its objects is masked or internalized. And the "mean- ing" of the throne is certainly not re- duceable to the results of a single static iconographic "decoding operation" (Bourdieu 1977:1). Its constituents accu- mulate prior to the throne's construction in an additive way, unsystematically over time, in numerous exchanges and encounters-a field of actions and moves that could be encapsulated by the term "practice"-between individuals, within ritual families, and in the setting of modern urban culture. Many of these moments of addition gain their signifi- cance in the context of promises made, obligations fulfilled, and personal strug- gles and desires as mediated by the orichas' involvement in priests' daily experience. Thus an important level of "meaning" must be identified in what Richard and Sally Price call "social meaning" (1980:188-93), that which is embedded in the micro-exchanges of everyday life-in this case as marked ritual exchanges. Exchange and the Ritualized Circulation of Objects As a special festival altar, the throne structures communication-drummed and chanted praises rendered, and div- inatory dialogue conducted, through obi divination (the coconuts)-between two worlds, and witnesses a wealth of gift exchanges between orichas and follow- i ~ :I~is la~L~b~ ~' r f~3 r ~t~f~i~ ~ J t p? ?% " .

Upon their arrival at houses cele- brating an oricha's birthday, priests immediately "throw themselves to the throne" (moforibale) to show respect for the oricha of honor, salute the oricha musically with a shaker or bell, and deposit monetary tributes in a calabash (jicara) or basket on the floor. The birth- day thrones of godparents who have large ritual families become, in the course of a day, veritable groves of coconuts and candles which their god- children must bring as a special tribute, and whose jicaras overflow with money. The spread of the basic plaza arranged by the throne maker grows in proportion to the arrival of the gift-bearing faithful to the house, and ebbs as the cornucopia is later distributed and consumed. Just about "everything sweet is given out to the people" (interview, Melba Carillo, Mar. 20, 1987). Gifts initially made to the oricha cycle back to refresh the givers anew with food that has absorbed the orichas' ache. The cutting and serving of the oricha's birthday cake happily borrow a secular form in dramatizing the distri- bution of sweet blessings. By the end of the evening the mat of the throne is virtu- ally defoliated. Within thirty-six hours its contents have traveled from supermarket bins to the throne-from actual plaza (market) to the throne's plaza; have been presented to the orichas and then recipro- cated, to be eaten immediately or taken home, often in the same shopping plastic or brown paper bags used to purchase the fruit in the first place. The fruit taken home is eaten by the guests' family and friends in an exponential spreading of the oricha's blessing. Finally, the gift cycle includes many constituents of the throne itself. New 12.

Union City, New Jersey, 1987. additions of cloth and beaded objects make for considerable variation in throne design from year to year. Whereas some objects are purchased or made for one's own orichas, others come to the house as gifts from godchildren and, in fact, from other orichas. When orichas "come down" at drummings, they often give away the patios and even the very ropa de santo in which they have been dressed. The patios may soon appear upon the blessed recip- ient's own enthroned orichas. Thus, the composition of a throne and its attendant meanings are produced collectively through the circulation of status gifts, some of which do not remain for long in the same house, suggesting an informal and fluid inner-city gift-exchange net- work, which interfaces with the mass marketplace of commodities.43 Thrones of Oricha Royalty in Afro-Cuban Cultural History Lydia Cabrera in 1954 remarked upon the royal protocol-a set of gestures and images-evident in everyday Afro- Cuban Lucumi religious practice and most powerfully in the asiento or kariocha (initiation) of priests and priestesses. The elder priestess Oddedei (Calixta Morales) explained to her that "to make Santo is to make a king, and kariocha is a ceremony of kings, like those of the palace of the Oba Lucumi" (Yoruba king).44 And, she stated, the priests and priestesses of Afro-Cuban Lucumi reli- gion, "the babalao, and the mamalochas, formed a court like the one there" (in Africa)(Cabrera 1983b:24 fn.). The pageantry of the Dia del Medio existed, Cabrera was told by her informants, "for the simple reason, 'that the Orichas were kings'" (Cabrera 1980:179). Though we might want to qualify Oddedei's allusion by distinguishing ethnographically between the ritual enthroning of Yoruba divine rulers on the one hand and the initiation of cult members on the other, she in fact in- vokes a mythico-historical understand- ing common to the Yoruba themselves: that the brisi were "princes of the royal family" of Oduduwa, founder and first Oni of If6, princes "who traveled away from their home in all directions to found new kingdoms and dynasties" (Smith 1969:19-20). As Obas-new kings of their respective domains-each of them bore a crown as a sign of their rightful office. Today, the possession of 54 african arts</page><page sequence="12">such a crown and genealogical links to Oduduwa legitimate the authority of Yoruba kings. In effect, kings are official- ly the descendants of certain 6rish~.45 It is no less significant that Yoruba cult mem- bers, the aworo, are considered not only as the "kings" (alddd, crown wearers) of their ritual domains-their shrines-but also the "kingmakers," for the king who wears the beaded crown is dependent upon them to "safeguard the crown and revitalize its powers," his ashe, in annual festivals (Apter 1992:103-5). While all agree that West African Yoruba ritual is the ultimate source of Lucumi practice, many have observed that African traditions were creatively reworked and reorganized in the Amer- icas (e.g., Mintz &amp; Price 1976; Bastide 1978; Thompson 1983:18). In late eigh- teenth- and nineteenth-century Cuba, the important proximate, contextual source for the emergence of Lucumi royal religious symbolism is to be found in stylistic traditions elaborated during and after the colonial period within Afro-Cuban religious brotherhoods called cabildos (Bastide 1972:95; Brandon 1983:61-94; Palmii 1989). The "focus" of African-derived religious practice- what William Bascom defined as "stones, herbs, and blood" (Bascom - !i PTD BR - . ;2 i:'; :N *iL*i 1950) along with African patterns of div- ination, sacred music, spirit possession, and structures of leadership-was reem- bedded in a set of expressions congruent with the island's distinctive cultural his- tory. The authority and splendor of elected or hereditary cabildo officehold- ers-kings, queens, courtiers, and mili- tary aides-were encoded in symbols creatively borrowed from Spanish or colonial Cuban iconography of the eigh- teenth and nineteenth centuries. European aristocratic styles were end- lessly copied and revived in colonial Cuba by an emerging bourgeoisie of merchants and planters: lavishly draped and layered floral cloths, gold-gilt adornment, porcelain, and faience. Appropriated, in turn, by Afro-Cubans, these objects and styles became tradi- tionalized as status objects in the presen- tation of Lucumi orichas. That is, Afro- Cubans brilliantly reinvested colonial Cuban forms with new significance in constructing the "royal" setting for ini- tiatory and ceremonial practice. Change occurred not through a single agentless encounter between "Spanish" and "African" traditions, but through a dynamic socio-cultural history in which Africans and creoles built institutions and actively engaged in constructing and presenting themselves in relation to their changing surroundings. This in- volved both the preservation of Yoruba ritual patterns precisely through a con- scientious reworking of them, and the borrowing, copying, or appropriating of available symbolic elements and whole stylistic systems for enjoyment and empowerment. The kinds of transfor- mations that historically occur in creole settings, Karl Reisman insists, involve "not merely the passive results of histo- ry" (1970:131). Cultural borrowing does not necessar- ily represent dilution, loss, or corruption, as implied in recent Yoruba Reversionist writing seeking to "purify" the tradition of foreign elements (see Mason 1985). To my mind, "copying" and "imitation" re- main uncomfortable concepts only if one acquiesces to the hegemonic conceit that people easily succumb to assimilating pressures; we should look for creative behavior, practical and tactical processes of resistance through transformation, or what recent theorists have called "critical revision" (Gates 1988; Apter 1992). A deemphasis of "origins" as prima- ry and determinant in cultural investi- 13. Mantle (manto) of the Virgin of Regla, dis- played in its cabinet.

If we follow recent work by Handler and Linnekin, moreover, we are forced to relinquish the formalist, essentialist, or natural science point of view, which "identifies the essential attributes of culture traits rather than to understand our own and our sub- jects' interpretive models" (Handler &amp; Linnekin 1984:274). Lydia Cabrera suggested, probably based upon readings of Fernando Ortiz (1921), that the Afro-Cuban religious brother- hoods (cabildos) during the colonial peri- od carried on traditions of kingship that appeared to mirror those of Africa. The "royal honors" that were rendered to cabildo kings and queens, perhaps as late as the 1880s, were reflected in certain "courtly reminders," that is, an "etiquette shown by junior priests toward their most distinguished elders," that she observed in the 1950s and were reported to her by her elderly informant Oddedei (Cabrera 1983b:24 fn.). In 1853 the Swedish traveler Freder- ika Bremer visited a wealthy, well-ap- pointed and well-staffed Lucumi cabildo in a black barrio just outside the walled city now known as Old Havana. She described its elegant king and queen as possessed of "a throne with a canopy over it," under which stood their seats and near which was a crown painted on the wall. Greeted by the king and queen, she watched festive drumming and dancing proceed before the throne in what may be read as a religious celebra- tion complete with spirit possession. A conscientious observer of customs, Bremer made a tribute of money to a male dancer apparently possessed by the deity Chang6 as well as to the society's coffers (Bremer 1853, vol. 2:380-81). In journalistic reports of the first half of the nineteenth century, observers of Carnival on the January 6th Day of Kings described cabildo queens as they emerged in dress the style of the whites, covered with fine Spanish lace, sash of precious stones, belt and scepter of gold, pendant earrings and necklace of pearls....Each queen had her court of young slaves, in imitation of her aristo- cratic mistresses [female masters], decked out luxuriously. (Ortiz 1921:6-9) One cabildo king was described as wear- ing "a genuine costume of a king of the Middle Ages, a very proper red, close coat, velvet vest and a magnificent gilt paper crown" (Aimes 1905:20-21). Other officers such as the Mayor de Plaza (Chief of Ceremonies) wore "long mili- tary coats, starched shirts...flamboyant doublepeaked hats, gold braid...swords on the belt...[etc.]...All of these adorn- ments," noted Ortiz, "were taken princi- pally from the Spanish Army" (1921:6-9). Many observers regarded such formal expressions of cabildo courtly hierar- chy as grotesque and humorous "imita- tions" of "the adornments and dress of the whites." I suggest, following Roger Abrahams (1983:26), that cabildo proces- sions in stylized court and military dress artfully presented subversive public models of royal wealth, order, power, and alternative authority. The presenta- tions were strategically masked by the ambiguity of the signs and thus were "safe": these were just slaves and of course it was just entertaining-"slav- ish"-imitation. Karl Reisman suggests that the sym- bolic technique of "taking on" dominant cultural forms and "remodeling" them has characterized the emergence of cre- ole cultures in the Caribbean. In a range of practices, Caribbean people "re- shap[e] the forms of symbols to resem- ble as closely as possible both the historical source and the forms current in the environment" (Reisman 1970). The case of Yoruba kings and cabildo kingship seems to be a good example of this. While Oddedei's reference is to the "palace of the Oba Lucumi"' "there" in Africa, this is not necessarily the same Yoruba king that the contemporary ethnographer knows. Her language is reoriented to, and shaped by, the unique- ly and historically Cuban ethnic nomen- clature for the Yoruba-"Lucumi"--the nearest ("emic") rather than the more remote ("etic") term. How might the creation of Afro- Cuban royalty be understood in terms of the creolization model? First off, a new language or system of signs is not created through the simple synthesis, blend, or reconciliation of two different languages-in other words on the popu- lar A+B=C syncretism model or the binary "tourist-guide" model (Decamp 1971:21-22). The process requires at least three languages and an available pidgin grammatical system; it might involve, for example, two or more minority groups under colonization or conquest, establishing a new common language by drawing lexical items into the pidgin grammar from the third lan- guage-the tongue of the colonizer-as well as usable terms from their respec- tive mother tongues (a process known as "relexification") (Decamp 1971). In the Lucumi context, it is Africans and their descendants of diverse Yoruba ethnicities and related regional peoples who occupied subordinate status in the slave society and its aftermath, con- structing an emergent Afro-Cuban cul- ture in relation to, and against, the dominant Spanish-Cuban system of signs.46 In the religious domain, the core ritual patterns were reworked, having been wrenched from their "wealth of institutional and ritual detail" (Bascom 1950:68) in Africa and reembedded in new socio-ritual and aesthetic frame- works in the New World (Bastide 1978). The fundamentals of stones, herbs, blood, and patterns of divination, drum- ming, and spirit possession were not lost but reworked and critically differentiat- ed from dominant Catholic practice at the same time that they borrowed aes- thetic ideas and even structural pat- terns from it. A "creole"-uniquely New World-"mother tongue," religiously speaking, emerged, through relexifica- tion and elaboration, ritually and aes- thetically. African stones and shells-the fundamento of the orichas-came to be fed in prestige copies of rococo porcelain soup tureens, initiations consummated under grand canopied thrones, and initi- ates presented in the royal or quasi-mili- tary garments on the models of those described to us by nineteenth-century cabildo observers. Using the terminology of historical linguistics, Roger Abrahams and John Szwed suggest that many borrowed per- formance elements-the equivalent of lexical items-are "loan translations" or "calques" incorporated according to the "ethical and esthetic demands of a con- ceptual system shared by Africans and Afro-Americans....Many of these fea- tures (such as the oratorical variety of Standard English) were introduced into ceremonial proceedings as a substitution for similar prestige varieties used for oratory in West Africa" (Abrahams &amp; Szwed 1983:36). In short, cabildo kings, queens, and their courts may be seen as Afro-Cuban creolizations of African structures of authority and centers of power (see Aimes 1905). With historical changes like the suppression of the cabil- dos and emancipation in the 1880s, Afro-Cubans continued to transform themselves and their religions (Ortiz 1921; Scott 1985). The framework of pop- ular religion among Cubans and Afro- Cubans, which included African religion and "folk" Catholicism-a Catholicism that Cubans say they practice "in my own way" (en mi manera)-was and remains one such local or regional "con- ceptual system." Whereas the eighteenth- and nine- teenth-century cabildo leaders called kings and queens possessed a formal- ized administrative role and political relationship (as official "ambassadors") to the colonial power, in the late nine- teenth and early twentieth centuries specifically religious houses of the oricha (houses of ocha) emerged from the insti- tutional base of the extinct old-style cabildos. When the politico-administra- tive structure fell away and oricha hous- es split off and went underground, 56 african arts</page><page sequence="14">~rsrWNr~=r~n J-ail~ Fv W "r . nl,:rAl X;R PHOTO: DAVID H. BROWN powerful priests and priestesses re- mained as leaders, notably the emerging ritual specialist-administrator within the house of ocha called the obd-oriatf (king or head of ritual proceedings and div- ination). Babalawos-Ifc diviners-with- in their own organizations ranked themselves with nomenclature that derived from Yoruba titles, including that of oba (king). This history lends sug- gestive context to Oddedei's remark that the "babalao, [and] the mamalochas formed a court, just like there" (in Africa) (Cabrera 1983b:24 fn.). At the same time, it seems, the glori- ous symbolic styles from the period of the old-style cabildo royalty have re- mained to this day as the distinctive adornment of the orichas themselves who are seen as "kings" and "queens." When Oddedei located the origin of rit- ual coronation in African royal tradi- tions, she was correct; yet the materials and styles in which their royalty was figured-thrones, formal festive costume, crowns-in great part were elaborations upon models derived from the proximate source of the cabildo hierarchy of kings and queens, combined, of course, with reworked Yoruba-derived models of beadwork and oricha iconography. Royal canopied thrones and garments of specifically religious initiation were modeled after, or emerged historically in tandem with, cabildo royal styles, which themselves were imitations or appropri- 14.

Madruga, Havana, Cuba, 1989. ations of colonial Cuban models. In speaking about the religious throne and costuming tradition, it is historically erroneous, if not insensitive, to refer to it as "Spanish" or "European." What I have called its proximate source-cabildo material culture-was already Afro-Cu- banized and traditionalized within the institution of cabildo kingship. New Jersey priestess and seamstress of ritual garments Lourdes L6pez was taken aback when I suggested that her designs were European in style; she responded that they were Cuban, as taught to her by her godmother in ocha (interview, Feb. 21, 1987). What is Cuban is com- plexly creole and emergent in ways that defy formalistic readings that focus upon putative ultimate origins, leapfrog- ging a whole cultural process of contex- tually embedded choices by creative New World people. If emergent oricha thrones and garment styles were nourished by the material cul- ture of the rising Cuban bourgeoisie in the nineteenth century, throne makers drew also from Catholic forms of sacred presentation. For example, the draping of cloth upon altars (the dossal) and over the saints (their mantles, or mantos), and the symmetrical, cosmically soaring architecture and gold-gilt ornamentation of church and domestic altars (see Fig. 14) offered visual inspiration. Such dis- crete propitiatory media as candles, flow- ers, and ex-votos came to serve the needs of the orichas. The pafos covering enthroned orichas were undoubtedly modeled after the style of draping statues of Catholic saints. These statues are dressed in lav- ish, sparkling, brocaded mantos or pafos that fall cape-like over the shoulders and back, often combined with a mantil- la that covers the head. Ornamental gold crowns (and halos) grace their heads. For example, as displayed in its own canas- tillero-like cabinet in the chapel behind the main altar of her church, the capa- cious sea-blue manto of the Virgin of Regla, bordered in silver braid and sur- faced with silver floral patterns (Fig. 13), looks to be the inspiration of a common pai~o type hung upon an oricha throne.47 The Virgin is specially dressed in the manto on her feast day, September 7, when she heads a procession through the streets of the town of Regla.

She pointed to the large statue of La Virgen de las Mercedes (The Virgin of Mercy) atop her antique white canastillero, comparing the saint's crown to one she had recently made for Obatala, the signif- icant difference being one of detail (inter- view, Lourdes L6pez, Feb. 21, 1987). Yet far from being "Catholic elements," the clothes and accessories of the saints are artfully recontextualized signs of prestige for the greater glory of Lucumi orichas. The flat, symmetrical, soaring archi- tecture of church and domestic Catholic altars, in which the saint of honor is cen- tered and supported by a constellation of angels and companion saints who also wear brocaded mantos, suggests itself as one important model for Lucumi throne- work (Fig. 14).48 Yet the means of throne construction are wholly different, em- ploying cloth as opposed to stone or wood architecture. At the same time, the Yoruba brought definite patterns of altar making to Cuba, whose organization was not inimical to Catholic forms. John Pemberton studied shrines for Eshu in Ila-Orangun, Nigeria: Some are large chambers which open upon a main corridor, with raised altars that can be seen through an entrance resembling a proscenium arch....the pedestal is called ijoko Eshu ("seat of Eshu") and the calabash is simply referred to as igba Eshu ("calabash of Eshu")....Cloths of appropriate colors, dance vestments with long strands of cowrie shells, and dance wands hang on the wall behind the calabash, enhancing the impor- tance of the central symbol just as a dossal frames the cross on a Christian altar. (Pemberton 1975:20-22) Eshu's shrine is at once altar and throne, whose presentational form reminded Pemberton of something Western. Afri- cans in the New World apparently found something in the material culture of the Cuban church and state which remind- ed them of something African.49 Recently documented examples of thrones in Cuba dramatically combine the foregoing sensibilities. In one a dos- sal bearing the image of the Virgin of Regla frames the elevated vessel of Yemayi covered by the protective, embracing blue skirts of a black doll that may be read multivocally as the Virgin herself (she carries a crucifix and the Christ child) and as a spirit doll repre- senting a servant of Yemayi (Fig. 15). PHOTO: DAVID H. BROWN Bascom observed this up-down configu- ration of saint over oricha: While chromolithographs and plas- ter images of the Catholic saints are prominently displayed in the shrines and houses of the santeros, they are regarded as empty ornaments or decorations, which may be dis- pensed with. The real power of the santos resides in the stones, hidden behind a curtain in the lower part of the altar, without which no san- teria shrine could exist. (Bascom 1950:65) The concealing of orichas with cloth of the saints may have been historically a strategy of defensive masking (Reisman 1970; Bastide 1978:260; Metraux 1972: chap. 6; Thompson 1983:18)-and still may represent a safely ambiguous front where persecution has not abated. But it has at the same time become traditional- ized as a cherished mode of present- ation in what emerged as a popular religion that located saints and orichas in distinct, sometimes parallel and some- times hierarchical registers of spiritual being (see Murphy 1988: chap. 11; Wafer 1991:14-15). In some of the most "tradi- tional" houses of ocha in Cuba, saint statues are highly prized. I dare anyone to try to take them away from their owners. Yet variant traditions do exist: some houses and ritual lineages empha- size the saints while others do not. Thrones I observed in New York, New Jersey, Miami, and some houses in 58 african arts</page><page sequence="16">Havana do dispense with the saints, re- sulting in far more abstract tableaux. Historically, while individual creative choices were important in the emerging throne art of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, these must be seen in the larger context of class and the international marketplace. What circle of options affected or constrained the rising style? To begin with, we see the vigorous nine- teenth-century trade in mass-produced export-porcelain and luxury objects for the consumption of the emergent Cuban urban bourgeoisie made rich between 1820 and 1860 by slave-produced sugar (Faniel 1957; Thomas 1971). The versions of royal styles that this class copied from France and Spain (Thomas 1971:142-48; Faniel 1957:38)50 became available for appropriation by Afro-Cubans because of an expanding marketplace. The sopera (soup tureen), for example, became a prized object in Cuban homes of all classes, saturated with the mean- ings of domestic family nurture, well- being, and status. The sopera styles that became traditionalized in Afro-Cuban religion were the most popular oval and octagonal forms of the Chinese export trade and European-centered manufac- ture in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, mass-manufactured and shipped throughout the world increas- ingly in the first half of the nineteenth century. Copies of copies of the "origi- nal" styles remain universally popular (Fig. 16) (Fay-Halle &amp; Mundt 1983:11-12; Palmer 1976; Godden 1979). In the nineteenth century also, the most lavish thrones and ritual garments appear to have utilized an extraordinary array of African adornments that were being imported in the "lucrative trade carried on by Canary Islanders who plied the West Coast of Africa to supply them- selves with goods to sell to priests of the Lucumi cult and other African cults in Cuba" (Cabrera 1980:176). Combining adornments such as African animal skins, horns, beads, cloths, rugs, and cowries, as well as European-derived luxuries, the thrones and garments of these late-nineteenth-century houses of ocha must have appeared as remarkably creative bricolaged assemblages. The log- ical extension of this international trad- ing and marketing phenomenon in the twentieth century is the extraordinary specialized market for ritual goods, called the botdnica, found in most major U.S. cities (Fig. 16). With such a trade in mind we can revise the acculturative stereotype of irreversible dilution from some primor- dially pure state. Perhaps, bereft of African materials as a result of the Middle Passage, ritual assemblages were re-Africanized over the course of the nineteenth century (see Bastide 1978:66, 165) even as they appropriated styles from the Cuban bourgeoisie. Urban ethnic culture can thus be re- newed thanks to the marketplace rather than withering in the face of it (see Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 1983). While it is clear that only the wealth- iest houses of ocha could afford the most expensive trade objects, they may have set stylistic trends that were copied in budget media by the less fortunate. Cheaper objects nevertheless sent simi- lar messages of prestige. Cabrera's informants reported that in nineteenth- century houses of ocha that initiated light-skinned creole women who were kept by wealthy Spanish gentlemen, the thrones were astonishing in their extravagance; while those in poorer houses were "nothing of luxury!," con- sisting of white sheets hung from the wall, often painted with floral designs (Cabrera 1980:176-77). Shrines in more impoverished houses have relied upon brightly painted clay vessels (tinajas) (Fig. 8) or chumbas consisting of two bowls, one inverted as a lid (Ortiz 1973:79), adding the highly prized sop- eras when possible. On the other hand, certain orthodox houses may have have resisted creolizing trends by falling back on more "purely" African models, retaining, for example, the use of lidded natural calabashes instead of porcelain soperas (GonzAlez Huguet 1968:34). What appears to us in this histo- ry-not forgetting, of course, powerful preservations of core practices-is a great chain of imitations, appropriations, bor- rowings, importations, and renovations across space, time, and class, given the largest context of global changes. It cul- minates, in our moment, with Lucumi thrones and garments made all the more luxurious by Cubans in the United States in the last three decades. If these traditions have resulted from the process of Caribbean creoliza- tion and migration, it does not mean that other agents might not subject them to further shifts according to their own aesthetic and ethical demands. I have in mind the ideological agenda of Black Nationalism in the United States. The first black Americans initiated by Cubans in Matanzas in 1959 inaugurat- ed a movement of black American Yoruba which has sought to "purify" the religion of European and Catholic elements, a strategy later called "Yoruba Reversionism" (Mason 1985:iv-v). Their wearing of Yoruba clothes and rejection of saint statues contributed to a split with New York Cuban priests (Hunt 1979:27). Their changes can be seen as self-conscious relexifications in an ethi- cal and ideological context in which ele- ments of the Cuban creole tradition are seen as irrelevant or antagonistic to black American identity. Thus they deci- sively reworked their practice as a "neo- Yoruba" religion (Omari 1991), which departs radically from an aesthetic and cultural history that Cubans and other Latinos share.

He died in the spring of 1993. The work presented here represents a rewriting and rethinking of parts of chapters 1 and 7 of my Ph.D. disserta- tion in American Studies, directed by Robert Farris Thompson (D. Brown 1989). It derives in part from disserta- tion research conducted in New Jersey, New York, and Miami with the support of a pre-doctoral research grant by the Wenner Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research in 1987, from dissertation writing with support from the Charlotte Newcombe Fellowship (Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Foundation) in 1987-1988, and from research in Cuba in 1989 as part of a post-doctoral fellowship at the Office of Folklife Programs of the Smithsonian Institution. I cannot thank enough the following priests and priestess- es for their patience, cooperation, and generosity: Luis Castillo, Melba Carillo, Idalberto Cardenas, Lourdes L6pez, Luis Bauz6, Ernesto Pichardo, Zenaida Villanueva Justiz, Hermes Valera Ramirez, and the late Adolfo Fernindez. I would also like to thank Judith Bettelheim and Donald Cosentino for encouraging me to seek publication of this material in African Arts, Michael A. Mason for reading and commenting upon a draft of this manuscript, and Ysamur Flores for giving me the opportunity to present the confer- ence paper that contained the working version of my cultur- al history argument (the final section here) at his American Folklore Society panel in October 1992. 1. Santeria means "the way of the saints." La Regla de Ocha means the "order of the o[ri]cha," ocha being a contraction of the Yoruba-derived word for deity. (A note on orthography: throughout I use the Spanish form oricha in Cuban contexts, which is how it is spelled and pronounced there, as well as the Spanish names for the deities--Ochuin, Chang6, etc.) Members of various Yoruba ethnic subgroups, brought to Cuba as slaves in the greatest numbers between the last decade of the eighteenth century and about 1865, were known as the Lucumi (or Lukumi) (Lachatafier6 1961:3). For data on numbers of Yoruba slaves that were taken to Cuba see Curtin 1969. The religion of the Lukumi, always ensconced and secret within the colonial period's cabildos (religious brotherhoods) and later houses of ocha, has been intermittently persecuted or ignored until quite recently. From the 1940s to 1980 hun- dreds of thousands of Cubans emigrated to the United States in four major waves, the greatest numbers arriving following the installation of the current Cuban revolution- ary government in 1959. Priest/throne maker Ram6n Esquiv6l was one of those who arrived from Havana with the 1980 Mariel Exodus. More than one million Cubans now live in the United States (Clarke 1981; Dixon 1983, 1986). La Regla de Ocha has been established in New York, New Jersey, Miami, and California, as well as Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Mexico. 2. Including Caribbean Cultural Center 1984; Miralda &amp; Mason 1985; Abramson &amp; Rodriguez 1985; Boza 1986; L6pez &amp; Keiro 1987; Lindsay 1992. Some of the constituent ritual objects (vessels, dance wands, clothwork and other Yoruba- derived iconography) have been studied and exhibited indi- vidually or documented in related domestic altar configura- tions, yet apart from their most dramatic presentation within thrones themselves (Cabrera 1983b; "Orichas" 1964; Gonzilez Huguet 1968; Dornbach 1977; G6mez Abreu 1982; Center for African Studies 1982; Thompson 1983; Bolivar Ar6stegui 1990; Flores 1990). 3. However, I did much work in one house of ocha (also casa de santo or ilW-ocha) that was not a practitioner's home but a house exclusively dedicated to ocha ritual work. 4. Igbodfin means "sacred grove of the festival" as translated from the Yoruba, a place for the receiving of spiritual power (see Brown 1989:272, fn. 30 for a developed etymology). 5. Baldachins were of silk and gold thread, rich brocade, sus- pended from the roof, supported on columns, or projected from walls. 6. I say "three main" configurations or types, yet the throne form has influenced other functionally distinct rituals. The throne form was used by Ram6n Esquivil to fete a Palo Monte (Kongo-Cuban) spirit. At the same time, a throne is not always erected for a birthday, where economic means and other factors may be at play. 7. See Turner 1967 and 1969 for the theoretical and eth- nographic use of these terms which form the tripartite moments of the "rite-of-passage" model: separation, liminal- ity, reincorporation. In Lucumi religion, the initiate's ritual at the "river" the night before the main initiation rites might be seen to mark the beginning of his/her "separation"; entering the room, the formal commencement of his/her "liminality"; and the trip out of the house to the market, the moment of "reincorporation." While the term asiento can refer generally to the whole weeklong period/process of initiation, it more strictly refers to the key ritual events of the initiate's first full day in the room, the Day of the Asiento or "coronation," followed by the Dia del Medio (Middle Day) and the Dia del ItA, a day of intensive divination. See D. Brown 1989:chaps. 3, 4, 7 for more detailed description, as well as Cabrera 1980, Brandon 1983, Murphy 1988. 8. I am indebted to Brandon (1983:388) for a way to describe these proceedings in terms of the controlling metaphors of bride, king, and infant. lyaw6 is a surviving Yoruba ritual metaphor which in Africa situates the structurally feminized body of the initiate as subject to the penetration of the struc- turally male and ruling brolsj (see Matory 1986; 1991:pt. 3, chap. 11, app. 6). 9. Traditionally, OyA is "received" along with YemayA, Chang6, and Och6n when ObatalA is "made." She may or may not be represented with her own pailo on an asiento throne. In any case, the four colors-white, blue, red, yel- low-not only represent particular orichas but also can signi- fy groups of like temperament. For example, red can stand for, evoke, and invoke warriors and generally "hot" orichas such as EleguA, Ogin, Chang6, Agayd, Oyd; blue may do so for Yemayd and Och6si, as in the ceremony of painting the head during the asiento (see Ecun 1985:210, 66; Angarica n.d.:72-73). 10. The maker was Antonio Queiro (also spelled Keiro), according to exhibition brochures (Caribbean Cultural Center 1984, L6pez &amp; Keiro 1987). 11. In the Cuban-Lucumi ritual idiom the guardian angel is said to be "made," while the others are "received." The iden- tity of the oricha to be made determines which are received. Most iyaw6s emerge with ObatalA, Yemayd, Chang6, and Ochin, and some, additionally, with Oya or Agayfi. All have already received their EleguA, Ogin, and Och6si in prior rit- uals, and possibly other orichas like Olokun and St. Lazarus (Babalfi Ay6). See Brown 1989, chaps. 3, 7; and Ecun 1985. 12. See Bames (1989) for discussion of these roles in Africa as played by Og6n; Thompson (1983:18-33, 52-60) on relation- ships between Elegba, Ogun, and Oshosi; Karen Brown (1989) on Ogun's military history in Haiti; Murphy (1988:70-73) on these three "warriors." 13. In Lucumi they are called iruke (flywhisk), abeb6 (fan), ochW-chang6 (thunder axe), add-ogtn (sword of Ogdn). There are nuances and exceptions to these characterizations that are too extensive to be covered here. For example, Chang6 is also seen as a guerrero; there are younger and more aggres- sive roads of ObatalA that carry swords; and OyA can fight carrying a machete. 14. See discussions of the West African Yoruba ogo-elegba in Wescott 1962, Pemberton 1975, and Thompson 1976; and its manifestation as an Afro-Cuban hooked staff in Thompson 1983:32. 15. Garabato and machete in concert evoke concretely one of the ways Elegud and OgOin may be seen to "work" together. The hook permits EleguA, the trickster and glutton, to trip up unsuspecting travelers and grab what he wants. The tradi- tional Afro-Cuban campesino's straw hat (yary) and the rus- tic sidebag (cartera) of goat hide (chivo) mark this EleguB as a rural-dweller from outside the "town." Och6si, the Hunter, carries a sidebag of deer hide. 16. There is one silver bracelet for Obatalh, and then nine copper for OyA, seven silver for YemayA, and five brass for Ochin. The system of bracelet coding/wearing is too com- plex to elaborate upon here. However, it can be said that OyA's bracelets and Yemayd's are never worn on the same wrist as they are antagonists. ObatalA's is always worn on the left wrist. People who make male orichas do not wear the bracelets under the throne. People who make female orichas do wear the bracelets, but of them only the women wear them later, on the street. 17. Mazos are not always available or affordable, as in con- temporary Cuba; for example, mazos are not seen in Figure 8 over the soperas. They are sold, in abundance, at botinicas in U.S. cities, at prices ranging from $65 to over $100. Beadworker and priestess Melba Carillo understands the mazo as the descendant of the cascades of cowrie shells worn by priests/deities "in Africa" which she has seen in pho- tographs. Examples of cascading cowries are seen in the art of Eshu-Elegba (see Pemberton 1975) and Oshumare (Verger 1954). With respect to clusters of beads, William Bascom notes that priests of certain orisha wear "large bunches of beads ("idileke") around their waists, walk up and down until they are possessed by the deity" (1944:35). 18. I arrived at the approximation of three pounds by picking up several examples and comparing their weights against my three-pound Nikon F2 camera. The number 12,000 comes from a study of one example in which I counted its con- stituent beads. It actually had 12,615 beads (see Fig. 3). 19. The term mofia was taught to me by beadworker and ObatalA priestess Melba Carillo of New York. The mofia principal is formed when the two extremes of a length of beaded strands is brought together and threaded through a gloria-sometimes a triad of glorias. A mazo for Ochiln, which is based on fifteen strands (her number 5 x 3), results in a mofa principal of thirty strands. This mazo will have five main segments junctioned by five main glorias. With the mofia principal already formed by the joining of the circle, each of the remaining four moias is then tied to the main cir- cle at each of the four junctions, so that each appears to emanate from one of the large main glorias. A collar de mazo for ObatalI-AyBguna (Fig. 3), whose colors are white punc- tuated by red and whose basic number is 8 (and related multiples 16, 24, 32), is comprised of a main circle of sixteen strands with eight main glorias and eight moilas. Its mofia principal has thirty-two strands. A mazo for YemayA would have seven mohas and bead-strand clusters/patterns in mul- tiples of the number 7; Chang6, six and its multiples, in red and white; Och6n, five, beaded in yellow and amber with punctuations of red or green; OyA, nine, in brown or caramel beads with black and white stripes; Elegua, three, in red and black. 20. Robert Farris Thompson writes: "The gods of the Yoruba long ago chose beaded strands as emblems....Indeed the prerogative of beaded objects is restricted to those who rep- resent the gods, kings and priests; and those with whom the gods communicate, kings, priests, diviners, and native doc- tors" (Thompson 1970:8). 21. In a pre-initiatory ritual called the "first prendici6n," according to Cabrera, the neophyte, when "distracted" and "least expecting it," is snared with the white mazo of ObatalA (Cabrera 1980:146-47). ObatalA's mazo is used because he is the arch-divinity who has authority over, or "owns all" heads. 22. La presentaci6n al tambor is a procession of the iyawd entailing the initiate's delivery of a tribute (derecho) to the sacred bata drums (tambores de alid or defundamento), a ritual submission to the drums and ritual elders, and finally, the initiate's dancing for the first time before the drums. All this is dedicated to authorizing the iyawd to actively participate in drumming rituals that can involve spirit possession (for those destined to become possessed). Only two mazos are worn of the oricha-mother and -father, crisscrossed over the chest for the presentacidn al tambor. 23. See Matory 1986 and 1991 for brilliant discussions of the role of bodies and vessels as structurally homologous forms of containment of spiritual power. 24. However, exceptions have been made here and in Cuba for exhibitions and folkloric performances by cultural institu- tions. The former is, of course, the source of Figures 2, 6, 7. 25. Addimf-orichas received may include Olokun, St. Lazarus, the Ibeyi (twins), Oricha-Oko, Obba, Odda (Oduduwa), and DadS, among others (see Brown 1989, chap. 3). 26. This continues the tradition Karin Barber documents in Yorubaland: "Each devotee concentrates on her own brisd and tries to enhance its glory through her attentions. This involves not only making offerings and chanting oriki, but also spending money as lavishly as possible on their day to give the feast. In return, the brisa is asked to give blessings and protection....Personal magnificence enhances reputa- tion: it is the outward sign of greatness, and is described in images of riches, sumptuous garments, beads, beauty, ele- gance, graceful dancing, and so on." With these visual and verbal praises, the devotee's "concern is...to elevate and enhance her own [brisb] so that it will be able to bless and protect her.... [I]t is the devotees who spend conspicuously to increase the prestige of their brisb. Indeed, the devotee seems here to be combining the roles of supporter and Big Man. He adulates his brisk. and by doing so increases his own stature" (Barber 1981:735-37). 27. If a male dngel de guarda was made, the initiate "received" a female oricha as second parent or "mother" from the original group. If the dngel de guarda was female, the initiate received a male second parent or "father"-as determined by divination. 28. In the case of sacred bata drums, which are considered to embody an oricha in their own right (the spirit Afii), the drums, in effect, become an altar/part of the throne-as-altar. Drummings may variously, as the occasion demands, employ the goblet-shaped, double-headed sacred bata drums called fundamentos; unconsecrated bata drums called aberinkuld; a giiiro ensemble of gourd shakers called chekere or giiiros, conga, and bell; or even a violin ensemble to play sweet romantic music for Ochfin (las violinas para Ochin). For detail and analysis of Lucumi drumming celebrations, see october 1993 85</page><page sequence="18">Robert Alan Friedman's fine study of drumming, drummers, and ritual performance in Lucumi religion (Friedman 1982). 29. I have encountered cases of drummings added to birth- day festivities where drumming proceeds before the birth- day throne type. 30. OyA and Ochfin are the only two orichas that wear metal- work crowns, apparently because they are the two, some- times competing, wives and queens of Chang6. There are, however, examples of silver crowns for YemayA in Cuban ethnographic collections (The Fernando Ortiz Collection of the Casa de Africa in Havana). The program of brass (Ochdn), copper (OyA) and silver (YemayS) crowns for these three female orichas is identical to that found in the Brazilian Candombl (see Caryb6 1980). 31. Oyd's crown bears the tools of Og6in's forge, in copper, while Ochdin's has five brass depending oars or bracelets. 32. Oricha objects are produced in a substantial cottage industry that draws on the Garment District for bulk beads and cloth of startling variety, and on botdnicas and specialty stores for the objects used by the orichas. Tourist-industry figurated flywhisks, carved statues, and Asian masks are drawn from specialty importers of African and Oriental objects. The metalwork (herramientas) in brass, copper, and iron, such as the bracelets of OyA, YemayA, and Ochfin, the tools of Ogin, and the crowns of OyA and Och6in, is forged in small workshops and apparently then sold to larger out- lets such as Almacenes Shang6 ("Shang6's Warehouse") on Madison at 111th Street in Manhattan. 33. It is interesting to note that in the U.S. more commonly available fruits combine with more specialized tropical fruits that ethnically diversifying supermarkets are increasingly carrying, which were more traditionally used in Cuba. See Angarica (n.d.:87-89) for a list of fruits and foods traditional for the orichas prior to 1955 in Cuba, many of which are not found or used in the United States. 34. For developed studies of oricha food, see Edwards &amp; Mason 1981 and Miralda &amp; Mason 1985. 35. I coined the term "thronescape." 36. The crown of DadA is composed of alternated concentric bands of cowries and beads-four bands of cowries with one in the center at the very top, four bands of rows of beads. From widest band to center: A) cowries; B) four rows of red and white beads in the pattern 2W/4R/2W/4R, etc.; C) five rows of red and white in the pattern 2W/2R/2W/2R, etc.; D) cowries; E) four rows of red and white in the pattern 2W/4R/2W/4R, etc.; F) cowries; G) four rows of 2W/4R/2W/4R, etc.; H) finally a single cowrie at its zenith. Each "leg" of fringe consists of twelve cowries divided by units of red and white beads in the pattern 2R/2W/2R/2W/2R/2W/2R/2W, twelve units in all. 37. The bat, an emblem of phallic shape and great force, is used by Chang6 to enforce justice and defend his children, as he often also does with a whip (interview, Melba Carillo, Aug. 17, 1985). 38. In Cuba DadA is called La Corona de los Santos ("The Crown of the Saints") and La Hermana de Chang6 ("Chang6's Sister") in La Regla de Ocha. The relatively rare Afro-Cuban DadA is the last of a series of auxiliary orichas received by senior priests. She is often called Bafiani inter- changeably. In Yorubaland the crown, called baay6n:ni, is worn only by priests of Shango, while in Lucumi Afro-Cuban religion, priests of any oricha can receive the crown if necessary. 39. I am inspired here by Thompson's discussion of artistic representations of the descent of Shango's lightning (Thompson 1983:84-97). I went to Cuba for the first time in 1986 and took photographs of examples of Chang6 mortars and vessels in the collection of Fredesvinda Rosell, which were on exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts in Havana and in her own small ethnographic museum in Madruga, east of Havana. Esquiv6l saw these photographs following my return during that summer. In the spring of 1986 he painted the vessel and pedestal, which were then unveiled on his friend's birthday throne of August 17, 1987, in Union City, New Jersey. 40. I am grateful to my colleague Alice Jarrard for these observations. 41. My thoughts here emerged in conversations with my col- league Michael A. Mason, who originally suggested the Armstrong text to me. 42. "Grammatically animate" means to me a subject of dis- course, a spiritual interlocutor endowed with independent agency to effect change and mount bodies in order to act, heal, speak, and so forth. 43. My thoughts on the circulation and exchange of objects have been shaped by Appadurai 1986. 44. As an example of royal etiquette, Cabrera reported that following the coronation ceremony, "[around] [t]he iyawd, now installed on the apoti [mortar], with barefeet, the Iyalochas sit on the mat, also barefoot, and there [the iyaw6] remains like a king surrounded by his court, until sundown, receiving homage from those who come to salute him and deposit, in a calabash placed before him on the ground, a tribute of money" (Cabrera 1980:177). 45. Conjoined here are two distinct but related notions, one the "royalty" of the gods as founder-kings, and the other the divinity of Yoruba kings themselves; the former is an earthly metaphor that images divinity, and the latter a heavenly metaphor that officially authorizes the king's power. 46. Mintz and Price argue that syncretism or creolization occurred between African peoples in the New World as much as it ever did, if at all, between Africans and Europeans (Mintz &amp; Price 1976). 47. One wonders if it always was displayed in this way or if the church (re)appropriated this manner of display as a strat- egy of cooptation to draw santeros into the church and stress the primacy of the Virgin over YemayA. 48. The elaborate domestic shrine for Our Lady of Charity (Caridad de Cobre) (Fig. 14) in an eclectic but predominantly neoclassical style occupies the front room, facing the street, in the house of a famous deceased santero, Rigoberto Rodriguez, in Madruga, outside Havana. 49. The Yoruba conception of altar clearly bears the double reference of place of sacrifice and throne of dignified author- ity. The Yoruba term for "sacrificial altar"-the place in the shrine where offerings are made-is oja eb6 (literally "face" [ojW] + "sacrifice" [ebo]). Oj i can mean "face," "eye," "mouth," "presence," "surface," "edge" in different contexts, all rele- vant considerations for the nature of an altar as a mediating threshold, a place of encountering a deity in relation to whom "speaking," and "eating" are potent metaphors. See Abraham 1946:460-62, and Thompson 1983:58. Thompson, inspired by the meanings of oja eb6, has taught Yale Seminars in Yoruba Art called "Face of the Gods," which I was privileged to take. Yoruba linguist Michael Oladejo Afolayan translates ojt as "throne" in this fragment of praise poetry collected by Apter: "Bi O16kun 16 mi legbee/ 6 ye yin yeye 16j6 bdee" ("Walking with self-composed dignity like Olokun/ It befits you and befits the throne in the open place") (Apter 1987:261). 50. To express their new elevation the Cuban bourgeoisie bought royal titles for tens of thousands of dollars, were "'indolently fond of rich and gaudy furniture and apparel'" and spent "great sums...on houses, fountains, renaissance ceilings, marble staircases, and baths....Next to the [Moorish] palaces of the 16th and 17th centuries, and baroque adaptations of the 18th, there now arose classical palaces inspired by the French Revolution" (Thomas 1971:142, 146-48).
