<plain_text><page sequence="1">News and Notes Report of Guatemala's 'truth commission' LONDON/BERLIN/TOULOUSE (Latin American Weekly Re port/taz/Marie-Christine Lacoste). In February, the three mem bers of Guatemala's 'truth commission' (CEH: Comisión de Esclarecimiento Histórico) released their long-awaited report on the country's protracted internal war. In it they charged former Guatemalan officiais with acts of genocide against the Mayan population. The report blâmes the govemment for killing some 90% of the 200,000 Guatemalans who perished in the conflict between the army and leftist rebels. While the suspected culprits of these acts of genocide have not been named, the authors of the report say they can and should face trial. Critics say, however, that now that most of the govemment officiais from the worst phase in the early 1980s are out of power and an amnesty prevenís the arrest of suspected war crimináis, the report is likely to 'die on the vine'. However the commission's German chairman, Christian Tomuschat, argues that Guatemala's amnesty is restricted to™ crimes committed during fighting, and explicitly excludes geno cide. Those who committed acts of genocide, he contends, can always be prosecuted by the ministry of justice, since those crimes have nothing to do with the military conflict. "There were massacres of entire villages, a policy of total destruction," Tomuschat said "[in some villages] every human being was killed, including women, children, babies and elderly people [...] Nobody can explain these atrocities [except] as an attempt to exterminate an entire group as such." Tomuschat acknowl edged that the report named no individuáis as criminally responsible for the acts of genocide. In fact, the Oslo Agree ment signed by the govemment and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) in 1994 explicitly statedthat "the Commission shall not attribute responsibility to any individual in its work, recommendations and report, nor shall these have any judicial aim or effect." At least one commis sioner says that determining responsibility for the worst of fences should not be difficult. "In 1981 [when the worst phase^ of killing began], everyone knows who the President of the™ republic was, and who was serving as the army chief of staff," notes Otilia Lux de Coti. Although not mentioning him by name, Lux de Coti was pointing at the one man singled out by human rights groups for orchestrating the worst atrocities during 1981-83: General Efraín Ríos Montt, then the country ' s prési dent. It was during Ríos Montt's rule that the commission observed what Lux de Coti described as a transition from the govemment's war with Communist rebels to its attack on the indigenous Maya. The commission uncovered the existence of at least 630 massacre sites, she noted, and even saw some "planning documents" for the govemment's 1982-83 cam paign. The question remains as to whether the current civilian govemment will attempt to carry out any arrests or investiga tions into the actions of the military-backed régimes of the past. Many crimes are likely to fall under the amnesty, although the massacres of villages may not, as Tomuschat noted. The UN, which helped fund the report and was its officiai récipient, has not commented on whether further investiga tions are necessary.

The Mayaruins of Tohcok (also spelled Tohkok, or more correctly Tahkok) in the north-central région of the Mexican State of Campeche, are located about 4 km northwest of the town of Hopelchen, in the municipality of Hopelchen, and have been known since at least 1940. Access to the site is easy, as Highway 261 cuts through the site. When briefly visited by Edwin M. Shook and Tatiana Proskouriakoff of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1951 (C.I.W. Yearbook 50 [1951]:238), they investigated the Late Classic vaulted two-storey building of the main group, which they named the Painted Jambs Building, today known, in the nomen i' 'V-Q &gt;wr v i Fig. 1.

Andrews, who investigated the site exten sively over a number of years, as Structure I: "Photographs [and] plans... of what remained of the structure, and drawings of the exposed portions of two painted doorway jambs were obtained". An important discovery was the fact, that the doorway of the west wall of the centre room, Room 2, of Structure I featured mural paintings.Each jamb of this doorway "had been surfaced in ancient times with fine, hard, creamy white lime plaster on which was painted in black an elaborately costumed figure framed by a rectangular band of hieroglyphs. The same room has a painted capstone". Two photographs of one jamb, named the North Jamb, taken by Shook, are in the archives of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, preserved at the Peabody Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts (CIW 51 -9-139/140). Proskouriakoff s copy of the unique North Jamb painting (Fig. 1) was published by her 14 years later ("Sculpture and Major Arts of the Maya Low lands", Handbook of Middle American Indians [2, pt. 1 ] :491, Fig. 13,b, Austin, 1965). Presently, no trace of this or the other reported mural painting survives. The painted capstone is still in situ, but in a very ruinous condition; only a straight line and some round, glyph-like elements remain, all painted in black on the stucco surface of the centrally located vault capstone. " When re-visiting Tohcok in March of 1998, mexicon staff members Stephan Merk and Karl Herbert Mayer obtained the exact geographical coordinates of Structure I, lying only a few metres north of the highway, with a hand-held GPS receiver (latitude 19° 46.10' North, longitude 89° 52.55' West). The présent guardián of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia showed them two hitherto unpublished limestone sculptures and several polychrome stucco fragments which can be illustrated here." A severely broken and eroded bas-relief fragment, prelimi narily designated as Tohcok Miscellaneous Sculpture 1 (Fig. 2), has a height of 49 cm, a maximum width of 47 cm, and a thickness of 15 cm; the relief depth is ca. 0.6 cm. Typologically, the panel cannot be classified. The figurai image represents two seated human figures in side-view, facing each other.

This sculpture is heavily eroded and has lost all its détails. This artifact measures 24 cm in height, 13 cm in width, and 41 cm in depth. There may have been more stone sculptures at the site. Edwin Shook (written communication, November 1982), pro vided the information that a carved lintel lay on the west side of Structure I, which probably fell from its second storey, but by May 13,1951, when his visit took place "the lintel and many other sculptures had been removed from the site ". Of the eleven small, painted stucco pièces ( Fig. 4) probably constituting part of an originally larger painted stucco surface, all exhibit in a dark-red color straight lines and curvilinear designs on the white background, which may represent frame elements and portions of figurai or textual images. They cannot be pièces from the reported stuccoed jambs, which were painted in black. These fragments are evidence of the existence of another mural painting at Tohcok. Architecturally, George F. Andrews considers Structure I as Chenes-Puuc in style. 1% 115: * iV &gt; %■ % Fig. 4. Remnants of a mural painting from Tohcok (Photo: K.H. Mayer, March 1998). The Maya ruins of La Iglesia, Yucatan BONN (S. Schlegel). In March 1998 Stephan Merk and Karl Herbert Mayer, two members of themexiconstaff, accompanied by Susanne Schlegel of the University of Bonn, visited a small site, which locally is known as La Iglesia. They were guided by Rogelio Colli Mo from the village of San Simon, Y ucatan, and accompanied by Manuel Bonilla Camal and Don Victoriano from the town of Santa Elena, Y ucatan. La Iglesia is situated in the archaeological Puuc Zone, 7.3 km northwest of San Simon, close to the border between the Mexican states of Campeche and Yucatan. A hand-held GPS Navigator gave the following readings: latitude 20° 15.99' N, longitude 89° 51.37'W. mexicon • Voi.xxi • April 1999 29</page><page sequence="5">30 CID U0^r&gt;o 2 I 3 Ch 14^ 001 19 O 1=1 Fig. 5. Sketch map of La Iglesia. (Drawing by Susanne Schlegel, 1998). The access to the ruin is not very difficult. The first part of the way can be covered with a high-clearance vehicle following the old and meanwhile badly overgrown dirt road to Calkini, which turns west just outside the village of San Simon. After approximately 7 km the way is too narrow for vehicles and has to be continued on foot another 1.5 km heading southwest, until the borderline between Campeche and Yucatan. Following the borderline and heading northwest for another 1-1.5 km, the min is reached. According to inhabitants of San Simon and the village of Xculoc in Campeche, La Iglesia is a site with at least one monumental building with very high and partially intact rooms. This edifice presumably named the min because of its height and form. Inspite of this on the actual site only remains of low buildings and a rather limited building density could made out. Whether this min actually is the enigmatic La Iglesia as de scribed by inhabitants of the région or another unpublished site, is not yet clear. Between the borderline in the south and the settlement remains in the north (some 100 m) one crosses several fallen, fairly low terrace edges (Fig. 5), which were built for levelling the gentle hilly terrain. On top of the uppermost level of these terraces one passes the first scattered building remains, which are at least three meanwhile completely collapsed stone build ings. The largest of these buildings is a so-called "range structure" with formerly three or four rooms. Quite close to these stone buildings two chultunes and some pilas were noticed. To the north two large platforms or terraces, the total area of which could not be determined, border on the uppermost terrace and the building remains. The up to 1 m high eastern retaining wall of the westernmost platform is notably well visible. The eastern platform has side lengths of roughly 60 m. On top of these two platforms several architectural remains are dispersed in loose arrangement, all of them in a very bad condition: on the western platform are several stone buildings, preliminary designated as Structures 1 through 3 and 5, a possible platform or foundation brace, named Structure 4, as well as one chultun. The buildings on the eastern platform concéntrate on its southern part. Two stone buildings, desig nated Structures 6 and 7, one foundation brace, twosascaberas (one of which lies to the east below the platform), one chultun and a plain stone altar are located here. Structures 1 through 4 form a small courtyard, which is built up on three sides. At its open eastern side is a chultun. The buildings stand very close together. Structure 3 is located at the northern edge of the courtyard, representing the largest struc ture of this architectural complex with its two stories and 6 or 7 rooms. Only some wall sections, vault portions and parts of the doorways on the first floor are still preserved. The first story contains 5 rooms, which are arranged around a solid core: two rooms in a double row each on its eastern and western flanks (the southwest room is approximately 470 x 173 cm) with an additional room on its north side projecting out to the north. The two rooms facing south on the eastern and western side of the core have wide doorways with two remarkably thick columns and capitals. The plain doorway columns of the southwest room are still in situ (Fig. 6). A central stairway probably led once from the south to the second story. The latter consisted of at least one, perhaps two rooms. Of Structure 2 at the western edge of the courtyard, only part of the lower façade is preserved (Fig. 7): Three façade colon nettes in a row with a plain stone lying on top of them. This stone is probably part of the lower member of the medial moulding. The colonnettes have very long and barely tapered tenons. The faces of the colonnettes are decorated with horizontal bands in bas-relief on différent levels. , 'i wr5 Fig. 6. Doorway column of the southwest room of Structure 3.

Structure 1 is situated at the southern edge of the courty ard, right opposite of Structure 3. Presumably, it too had two stories and a stairway to the north. Structure 4 is a rubble mound bordering Structure 1 on the east and may be a foundation brace oraplatform. Situated to the north of this architectural group and at the northern edge of the common platform, Structure 5 can be found. It is a "range structure" probably containing two rooms. Each room had two doorways opposite each other, thus facing | both north and south. In addition to the entrances of the western room a small part of the undecorated lower façade is still preserved. Structure 6 is a stone building featuring originally two or even four rooms one behind the other. Only some sections of the dividing wall and small portions of the vault are preserved. A chultun lies northwest of Structure 6 and northeast a sascabera bordered with a ring-shaped stone setting. To the east of Structure 6 is another architectural group consisting of three buildings forming a small courtyard. These are small, originally one-room buildings: a stone building, designated Structure 7, defining the courtyard to the south, another uncertain stone building at the northern side of the courtyard and a foundation brace to the west. In the centre of the courtyard is a plain stone altar.
