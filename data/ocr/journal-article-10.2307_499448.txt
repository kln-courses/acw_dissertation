The vast Amazon area is generally considered to be of particular importance in South American archaeology. This impression arises from various scattered finds, some of which have been pub- lished, and also from deductive reasoning. On the whole, however, very little is known of sequence and chronology; lacunae are many, and archaeo- logical terra incognita prevails in abundance. It is only natural, therefore, that a systematic study aiming at a better understanding of Amazonian antiquity, should be deemed a welcome and a valu- able contribution. The pioneering work of Miss Palmatary, her first publication in archaeology, is indeed an attainment of special merit. She was first attracted to Tapaj6 pottery as a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. The Tapaj6 collections at the Uni- versity Museum, the Heye Museum, and the Giteborg Museum provided the main basis of a fertile subject for a tedious but determined study. Unable to visit Brazil (until 1939), Miss Palma- tary yet had the excellent advantage of drawing information and advice from Mr. Curt Nimuend- ajh, a practically encyclopaedic source on the Amazon. Miss Palmatary's study benefited from her mature logical orientation, from her dis- criminating sense of pursuing that which was truly significant to her purpose, as well as from her keen appreciation of art. The result is a con- cise, methodical, and clear description of a com- plex group of Tapaj6 pottery, revealing also extraterritorial comparisons and correlations. "The principal site from which Tapaj6 pottery has been obtained is Santarem; this is a city located at the mouth of the Rio Tapajoz, a large southern tributary of the Middle Amazon. The Tapaj6 were a numerous and powerful people when the first Europeans ventured into the heart of South America over the Amazonian highway, but, like many other aboriginal groups, gradually succumbed to the cruelties and superior weapons of the white man. A few remained on the Rio Tapajoz until about the middle of the eighteenth century when the Munduruchs descended upon that valley and eventually became masters of it" (p. 3). In section III, entitled "Stylistic Analysis" (pp. 7-53), a classificatory grouping and detailed descriptions of forms and designs are presented. The numerous subdivisions devised by Miss</page><page sequence="2">284 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Palmatary distinctly aid the reader by the order- liness so achieved. Larger vessels, smaller vessels, and elements such as rims, handles, figurines and their features, comprise the three major categories of the analysis. The various components of these categories are conveniently grouped into logical types. The treatment is governed by the criteria of form and design and is, therefore, essentially artistic. (Physical properties, qualitative details, and technologic aspects are not considered; these, Miss Palmatary well realizes, must be reserved for a competent specialist in ceramic technology.) Tapaj6 pottery comprises a variety of forms and designs. Caryatids, anthropomorphic vessels, theriomorphic and anthropomorphic figurines, footed vessels, tripods, concentric dishes, etc., are invariably so well shaped that precise identifica- tion is readily attainable. The decorative tech- niques include incising, punctations, applied relief, and painting. On the whole, the bulk of the pottery reflects considerable technical skill and general knowledge of ceramics on the part of the original makers. The Amazon area is easily accessible via its intricate and far reaching system of water-ways. The distance from the Amazon estuary to the Caribbean islands or to the coast of Middle America is not so great as to preclude contacts by sea even with the limitations of simple craft. Indeed, certain archaeological evidence indicates that some such traffic actually existed in an- tiquity. Moreover, Miss Palmatary ably argues, from comparative studies, in favor of ". .. pos- sible correlations between the Middle Amazon and certain cultures to the north, chiefly those of British Guiana, Venezuela, Panama, Costa Rica, the Antilles, and some areas of the Southern Mounds" (p. 59). By "Southern Mounds" is meant the mounds of the Mississippi Valley and the Southeastern area of North America, and the term is used as a generalization. The chief criteria for correlation are drawn from eye-forms, crescent- based figurines, caryatids, four-lobed vessels, the double-headed motif, the sigmoid scroll, hollow rims, supports, etc. On the whole, such features are distinctive, and the stated comparisons inspire confidence. It will doubtless seem like heresy to some, if not many, to read Miss Palmatary's conclusions that Tapaj6 pottery may have been derived from that of the Mississippian and Southeastern mounds. Such a thoroughly unorthodox concept is naturally incompatible with the teachings on which many archaeologists have been nourished. And yet it seems safe to anticipate rational re- actions and new stimulus to further studies of the new vistas opened by Miss Palmatary. Her pio- neering contribution will remain a solid basis from which to pursue further investigations. She is fully cognizant of the urgent need of filling the existing gaps, and specifically points out several problems and the ways to approach them. Miss Palmatary's contribution combines the advantages and disadvantages of a pioneering synthesis. Her modesty and sobriety might pos- sibly be mistaken for weaknesses, whereas they really constitute admirable virtues. With so many temptations on all sides, a less discriminate meth- odology might easily lead to unwarranted ex- cursions of fancy. It is significant to stress that Miss Palmatary is cautious in her deductions and that she carefully qualifies her conclusions on the whole as possibilities, not necessarily definite finalities. Whatever may be the results of further work arising from the leads of the meritable study under review, its fine presentation of the salient features of Tapaj6 pottery will remain a valuable and dependable source. The uniformly good illustrations, half-tones and line drawings, and the bibliography certainly increase the value of the book for reference. The usefulness of the map, prepared by Dr. Kaudern (p. 2), is deplor- ably diminished by incorrect names for several of the southern tributaries of the Amazon, and by the misplacement of Santarem. The river named on the map "Tocantins" actually marks the Tapajoz. The position of the city of Santarem should be changed conformingly, i.e., to the con- fluence of the Tapajoz with the Amazon.
