<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Comic Frame and the Rhetoric of Science, Epistemiology, and Ethics in Darwin's Origins In a short essay on public speaking written in 1838 Darwin's great political contemporary, William Ewart Gladstone, coined a memorable maxim summarizing what he considered the central ethical obligation of rhetoric. Early in the essay Gladstone observed; "The truth is not always loved when seen and it is not always seen when shown." 1 Gladstone's maxim nicely reverses philosophy's traditional ethical repugnance toward rhetoric. Indeed it seems to hoist philosophy on its own petard. Rhetoric, through Gladstone, seems to say "Who cares more about truth? The discipline that dooms it to failure through demanding inhuman standards of purity; or the one that enables it to succeed by adapting it to people as they are ?" That rhetoric might exact a cognitive price for its services does not seem an issue for Gladstone. According to his maxim "truth" - some knowledge sufficiently secure or important to be seen or at least shown - is possible. Given an accessible truth (however come by and however much owing on it) - the question for thought is how that truth can become public property. The first phrase of Gladstone's maxim "the truth is not always loved when seen" emphasizes the importance of transforming the merely intelligible into a principle of action - of presenting truth as a conviction to be embraced. The second phrase "and it is not always seen when shown" draws attention to the historical and psychological circumstances under which shared understanding is to occur. In both halves of Gladstone's maxim rhetoric emerges as a reflective and philosophic response to the needs of human cognition. What to philosophy would otherwise be distorting psychological, sociological and historical particulars to rhetoric are conditions that make perception possible and advocacy morally necessary. By making persuasive advocacy as integral to truth as questioning, doubting or inquiry itself, Gladstone's maxim is philosophically edifying. To accept Gladstone's maxim is to see rhetoric as comic. I want to problematize Gladstone's maxim by arguing that rhetorical practice always involves an element of epistemic risk. I will take the case of a well known epistemic drama with high cultural stakes involving rhetoric, reality and reason (the usual suspects - indeed my usual case). My aim is to show - despite a fabulously successful outcome (considered rhetorically and even philosophically) that the association of these terms in this case was never unambiguously happy. lWilliarn Ewart Gladstone, "Public Speaking," 267. Reprinted with an introduction by Loren Reid, "Gladstone's Essay on Public Speaking," Ouarterly Journal of Speech. 39 (October, 1953), 265 - 272. I have slightly edited the quotation for clarity. The original statement reads "Let him [the House of Commons orator] not suppose that he is to deviate one step from the course which Love of Truth would prescribe: but he is to learn that truth is not necessarily loved when seen: that she is not necessarily seen when shown: that she is not necessarily shown, when intended and honestly attempted to be set forth through the imperfect medium of language, and by faculties in a still more imperfect state of self possession: in short let him be guided by the love of truth, to adopt for his law and principle, the desire of making truth effective: for his object, the giving to that desire a maximum of effect." 267 RSQ, Vol. 24, Numbers 1/2</page><page sequence="2">28 John A. Campbell In his recent essay "Persuasion" Philip Kitcher takes Darwin's Origin and uses it to sketch five ways rhetoric is integral to the cause of science. 1. Dead rhetoric: the use of cliche or field-specific connectives or conventions to establish context. 2. Uncharted territory: changing the rules of the game and anticipating and blocking objections with audience-specific arguments. 3. Emergent rhetoric: recognizing that argument changes both the writer and the audience. 4. Inflaming the passions: bringing the affective commitments and desires of the audience into play. 5. Dialogues of one: that macro social change begins with the deliberations of "the audience of one".2 The whole of Kitcher's analysis is instructive. His account of function three is particularly refreshing because in it he candidly defends the most morally offensive aspect of rhetoric. Taking the example of Darwin's apparently insincere attempt to mollify the religious scruples of his audience he notes that when a scientific insight is blocked by popular belief (in Darwin's case belief in the God of the Bible) "it is epistemically desirable for the proposer to respond ... even if it requires deception." (Kitcher, 20). Kitcher's defense of deception suggests a moral cloud on the otherwise sunny horizon sketched by Gladstone's maxim. Yet consonant with Gladstone Kitcher sees the moral/cognitive benefits of rhetoric and Darwin's in particular as unambiguous. In the Gladstone/Kitcher account, deception might almost be described as a Cheshire vapor - a silver lining without a cloud. The aim of my paper is not to counter Kitcher's technical analysis of Darwin which I greatly admire - but to complicate our understanding of the role of rhetoric in science by broadening the epistemic context in which we frame its operation. Because of its very nature as a faculty for providing arguments on both sides of an issue, and because of the ethic of success inherent in rhetorical practice, rhetoric - despite its services to knowledge - must always be approached with epistemic caution. In shedding new light, rhetoric inevitably casts a shadow. Because paradigm shift inevitably involves paradigm loss, the rhetoric of science is at best a tragicomic enterprise. To hold the comic and tragic dimensions of rhetoric in productive tension Gladstone's maxim must be balanced by a maxim of that poignant and ironic defender of the comic, Kenneth Burke: "Even if any given terminology is a reflection of reality, by its very nature as a terminology it must be a selection of reality; and to this extent it must function also as a deflection of reality."3 2Philip Kitcher, "Persuasion," in Marcello Pera and William R.

As Alisdair MacIntyre has pointed out the specific rationality of a paradigm shift is found in the account of the previous paradigm embedded in the narrative of the new one. 4 If Darwin's misleading account of the theological implications of his own perspective was benign (assuming as Kitcher does that popular religion is an enemy of "the human epistemic project"5) his attribution to his predecessors and colleagues of a view of nature grounded in theology and hostile to science was not.6 Darwin's account of his own aims and his depiction of the explanatory ambitions of his precedessors and contemporaries is all of a piece. Darwin's brilliant rhetorical tactics in misrepresenting the cognitive grounding and explanatory motives of his predecessors' view of nature has had the consequence that while his great classic has facilitated our understanding of nature in many particulars it has also necessarily frustrated it in others.7 Prior Tradition and The Challenge of Darwin's Rhetorical Logic One of Darwin's single greatest persuasive challenges, in addition to explaining his own theory, was to explain how earlier researchers - those who had founded paleontology and comparative anatomy and discovered the sequence of formations and fossils in the geological record - had failed to discover evidence for common descent. (One of the meanings of our protean term "evolution"). Darwin's short answer is that his predecessors' perception of nature was a function of their 4AMisdair Maclntyre, "Epistemic Crises, Dramatic Narrative and the Philosophy of Science," in Stanley Hauerwas &amp; L.

Campbell metaphysical/religious belief in "the theory of special creation".8 His longer answer is to discredit "typological thinking" (Ernst Mayer's term)9 or "rational morphology" (Stuart Kaufmann)10 and the associated belief in catastrophes as a function of what in the language of Kenneth Burke we would call "trained incapacity" 11 - the inability of professionals in any field to see beyond their own specialty. Darwin argues that the habits of thought common to both breeders and naturalists blocked them from understanding properly even the data of their own fields. 12 An essential strategic element of the Qrigin, indispensable to the success of Darwin's enterprise, is to read the typological or "rational morphological" approach to organic form and the belief in world-wide catastrophes out of science - indeed to vilify both beyond redemption as epitomes of a prescientific mentality. It is true that the order of nature as it was understood from the time of Linnaeus to Cuvier to Darwin's immediate peers: Agassiz, Bronn, Pictet and Owen, had been understood as a system of fixed and disparate types.13 But Darwin's thesis, first set forth in opening paragraph of chapter two of the Origin, that what motivates belief in natural types is special creationism - while a polemical stroke of genius is- conceptually irresponsible.14 The statement is a polemical stroke of genius for in 8Darwin's first mention of this theory is in the Introduction to the Origin where it is referred to twice; there are no references in Chapter one; "created" and "creation" are mentioned twice each in Chapter two; the heavy references to "created" and "creation" appear later in the book;"created" is mentioned four times in Chapter eleven, five in twelve twice in thirteen and eighteen times in Chapter fourteen; "creation" is mentioned five times in Chapter eleven, nine in Chapter twelve, five in Chapter thirteen and twelve in Chapter fourteen. The polemical intensity of Darwin's attack on "special creation" intensifies as the book progresses.

Additional support comes from Hull, "Critics both at the time 11859] and since agree with Rudwick (1972:222) that in arguing against the special creationists, Darwin presented his theory with only a straw man to oppose it: either slow trans-specific evolution by means of "natural selection", or direct divine creation of new species from the inorganic dust of the Earth'." David Hull, "Darwin and the nature of science," in Evolution from Molecules to Men, ed. D.S. Bendall, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1983.) In the final chapter of the sixth edition of the Origin Darwin virtually admits as much: "...I have</page><page sequence="5">The Comic Frame and the Rhetoric of Science 31 epistemology as in politics the power to define is the power to destroy. The statement is conceptually irresponsible for the claim is itself metaphysical, it reflects directly Darwin's Comtean program - carnied forward from the time of his notebooks - of bringing biology into what he regarded as its final or "positive" stage.15 Typology - whatever its metaphysical allegiances - is first and primarily an empirical enterprise. Darwin's colleagues believed in the distinctness of each type not because they believed in the God of the Bible (to whatever degree they did) but because they felt that the discreteness of living forms was an accurate reflection of the order of nature. 16 Cuvier's celebrated ability to predict the remaining structure of an animal from a single exposed fragment of bone presupposed and seemed to prove the invariance of the unique defining features of each type.17 It was not that Darwin's peers did not believe in variation' Variation was as much a fact as the division of nature into discrete types. But variation was believed to be limited by the life-constraints of the form. 18 The same empiricism that applied to organic form also applied to the belief in catastrophes. Indeed it was the fact of extinction, demonstrated by Cuvier, that informed his belief in world-wide catastrophes as the only force adequate to account for them.19 To appreciate the rhetorical beauty of one of Darwin's major supporting arguments for his own cause - and the lasting disservice it has done to the perspective of his peers and predecessors, and the obstacles it has placed in the path of the study of organic form and of extinction - we must situate Darwin's attack on typology and catastrophes in the context of his argument. It is precisely because Darwin's account of the "typological perspective" and catastrophes seems a corollary of his larger case for the seamless uniformity of natural causes that it so commonly passes unquestioned and its rhetorical structure unexamined. Logic, Rhetoric and the Fabric of Darwinian Reason retained... several sentences which imply that naturalists believe in the separate creation of each species; and I have been much censured for having thus expressed myself." Darwin mentions that before publication of the QOriin, he never met with a sympathetic hearing from naturalists with whom he discussed his ideas and adds: "It is probable that some did then believe in evolution, but they were either silent, or expressed themselves so ambiguously that it was not easy to understand their meaning." 479. As one would expect of a strong writer with a potentially epoch making case, Darwin's account of his colleagues' beliefs was largely a function of the rhetorical requirements of his own argument. It is through such bold tactical moves at the beginning of an intellectual revolution that we see the power of rhetoric to change even collective memory. Subsequent history - in taking its cue from Darwin's account of his predecessors - inevitably becomes an apology for the victors. In intellectual revolution we might well substitute "epochal amnesia" for the classical rhetorical canon of "memory". 15See notebooks: D152, E 88, M 70, 72, 81, 135, N 12 OUN 25 in Paul H.

Campbell The argument of the Origin is a fabric of many strands. As logic the argument of the Qrigin can be summarized as a simple deductive inference. 1. Organisms vary, and these variations are inherited (at least in part) by their offspring. 2. Organisms produce more offspring than can possibly survive. 3. On the average, offspring that vary most strongly in directions favored by the environment will survive and propagate. Favorable variation will therefore accumulate in populations by natural selection.20 But Darwin does not allow the statement of his case to rest merely on the feeble reed of logic. Logic takes work and while some readers may grasp "evolution" as an inference from Malthusian population dynamics - others will be appalled by a conclusion that runs counter to everything they know. Indeed, in his account of the structure of the eye, Darwin admits what he is asking the reader to believe indeed "seems ... absurd in the highest possible degree", but, he urges (following a typically imaginatively rich passage) the problem is merely one of imagination and "can hardly be considered real." (Origin, 186- 187). Darwin's idea of allowing reason to conquer imagination contains the core of the rhetorical task of the Origin. It is easy enough to say that what Darwin means by "reason" includes "imagination", but more difficult to specify in detail how Darwinian reason functions through imagination. With Darwin one does not know which way of putting Bacon's definition of rhetoric "to bring reason to the aid of imagination for the better moving of the will"21 or "to bring imagination to the aid of reason for the better moving of the will" best fits the case. The specific historical achievement of Darwinian reason is to present itself so exclusively as the representative of scientific reason that any attempt to question the imaginative elements in the picture can be dismissed, as a failure to understand. 22 But there are places where Darwin's appeal to imagination is too patent to be disguised however it may be denied. The most noted example is his celebrated metaphor, or personification "natural selection" which - as Darwin himself hoped -has become a dead figure. In attributing human qualities to a random search process as in "Nature is daily and hourly scrutinizing ... adding up all that is good, rejecting all that is bad...." (Origin, 84) the figure is a personification. In combining contradictory qualities "natural selection" is also an oxymoron on the level of "unconscious/consciousness", or "brain dead/awareness". To understand the theory as a concept is to understand that nature in no sense of the term selects nature eliminates. 20Stephen Jay Gould, Ever Since Darwin, (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1977), 11. 21Sir Francis Bacon, The Advancement of Learning, Vol. III., 409. J. Spedding, ed. Works, (London: D.D. Heath, (1857-74). 221n later editions Darwin urged that the kind of personification he used in the Origin was no different than that used by astronomers in "speaking of the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets." "Brevity" he added made such terms necessary and that "With a little familiarity such superficial objections will be forgotten" Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species. (New York: Collier Books, 1962).92. (Sixth edition).</page><page sequence="7">The Comic Frame and the Rhetoric of Science 33 As I have argued elsewhere, as a personification natural selection is a necessary rhetorical antidote to the social absurdity of Darwin's technical Malthusian solution to the problem of organic change.23 In my view the rhetorical need for the analogy with breeding itself was made evident by the skeptical reaction with which his sister and brother-in-law met his first attempt to explain to them his "Malthusian views". The analogy with domestic breeding in principle brought the notion of the cumulative power of variation within social experience, even as Malthusian population dynamics could be explained as competition. The theological possibilities of the figure were evident from the first and Darwin's theological strategy for the theory was part of his planning from his first sketch in 1842 onward. Darwin's analogy with the breeder and his concept/metaphor/oxymoron "natural selection" are clearly examples of imagination brought to the aid of reason - indeed they are an attempt to use imagination to save reason from inferential work too demanding and too incredible either for the public or his fellow naturalists or for both. But Darwin's personification of nature as agent is not his sole appeal to imagination nor is the previous summary of Darwin's formal logic the only formal logic at work in the book. Another formal logic which is also aided by imagination is Darwin's use of vera causa logic. M.J.S. Hodge, following the work of Vincent Kavaloski, has pointed out that Darwin's early drafts of 1842 and 1844 followed the conventions of "vera causa" logic - a convention of scientific reason that was passed from the middle ages to modem science via the work of Bacon and Newton.24 According to this logic to show that something qualifies as a true cause one must first show that it exists independently of the phenomena it is to explain and that it is competent to bring about the effect required of it. In Darwin's work this logic unfolds in a three part pattern. Darwin's notes show that chapters 1-3 of the Origin were to establish the existence of variation and selection in nature in nature as in domestication; chapters 4-8 were to argue for the competence of variation and selection to bring about the effects claimed; and finally chapters 9-13 (chapter 14 being Darwin's summation) to argue for the probable responsibility of natural selection as the principal agency of organic change.25 On Hodge's reading the logic of Darwin's Origin is unnecessarily blurred because while functionally one can find the vera causa pattern in the Origin, structurally it is obscured by Darwin's failure to section his manuscript according to the divisions 23John Angus Campbell, "On the Way to the Origin: Darwin's Evolutionary Insight and Its Rhetorical Transformation," The Van Zelst Lecture In Communication, )Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University, School of Speech, 1990)19- 21., "Scientific Discovery and Rhetorical Invention: Darwin's Path to the Origin," in Herbert Simons, ed., The Rhetorical Turn, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990), 78- 84. 24M.J.S.

Campbell indicated in his drafts. As a result the first four or five chapters of the Origin follow an intrinsically logical sequence: Variation Under Domestication, Variation Under Nature, Struggle for Existence, Natural Selection, Laws of Variation. The next three chapters: Difficulties on Theory, Instinct, Hybridism, are a kind of miscellany in which Darwin poses and rebuts objections. The five remaining substantive chapters: On the Imperfection of the Geological record, On the Geological Succession of Organic Beings, the two chapters on Geographic Distribution, and the chapter on Mutual Affinities of Organic Beings, again follow an intrinsic logic and consider whether the process Darwin has described conceivably could have been responsible for what the facts of nature show. On Hodge's reading the strategic topography of Darwin's forest is obscured by the undifferentiated proliferation of his expositional trees. Despite this Hodge argues that a properly trained scientific contemporary would have been able to identify the larger pattern.26 Hodge's point is well taken. The Origin is not perfect even on its own ground. But here, as in the case of Darwin's Malthusian logic, there is an imaginative dimension that works, on the one hand, to make the vera causa logic functionally effective, and on the other to undermine its formal integrity as logic by making sure the desired conclusion is not left to the vagaries of unaided inferential reason. Imagination and Reason in Darwin's Vera Causa Logic The hold that Darwin's ideas have over the reader stem from a combination of their causal efficacy and their imaginative power - an imaginative power rooted in a shared common sense world. In a much quoted passage in the conclusion of the Origin, Darwin characterizes his preceding work as "one long argument". (Qigin, 459). Later in the chapter Darwin added, in a subsequent edition, that his method of inferring the truth of his theory from its ability to explain "several large classes of facts ... .is a method used in judging of the common events of life" as well as one "often ... used by the greatest natural philosophers." (Origin, 476, Sixth edition). Stephen Meyer has brilliantly demonstrated that in and through the vera causa pattern the Origin makes use of what Peirce called "abductive" inference.27 As opposed to "deduction" in which conclusions are entailed in premises and "induction" in which rules are generated from a knowledge of particular cases and results, in abduction Peirce notes "we find some very curious circumstance, which would be explained by the supposition that it was a case of a certain general rule and thereupon adopt that supposition." But abduction is a weak form of inference and "inclines our judgment so slightly toward its conclusion that we cannot say that we believe the latter to be true; we only surmise that it may be so."28 26Hodge, 245. 27Stephen C.

Particularly in his "responsibility" chapters - dealing as they do with unobservable past events - Darwin is not able to argue directly for natural selection and must make use of what Meyer calls "retrospective causal analysis". 29 What Darwin does show, however, is that various classes of facts - geological succession, geological distribution, embryology and homology are consonant with natural selection having occurred. 30 By a process Darwin's philosophic contemporary Whewell called "the consilience of inductions" Darwin was able to show that these "classes of facts" were explained by natural selection - even though natural selection itself (at least on this scale) could only be known by inference. As both Stephen Jay Gould and historian and philosopher of history Edward Carr have argued, bringing a properly historical mode of reason to the aid of biology is one of Darwin's most signal contributions as a thinker.31 Like the gradual process described by his theory, Darwin's rhetorical strategy unfolds through a series of epistemic increments. These increments do not necessarily correspond point by point with the formal logic of the work - but use it as their vehicle. While the formal logic of the Qrigin is just getting launched in the first several chapters of the book, by the end of the first and certainly by the end of the second chapter, Darwin has so freighted the epistemic agenda of his book with loaded images and examples that to refuse assent to his full agenda is tantamount to abandoning the naturalistic point of view. By securing early from the reader a commitment to the metaphysical agenda of his naturalism Darwin gains an additional hold over the imagination of his reader that he then uses as a powerful epistemic stick with which to keep the reader in line when the going gets tough and the evidence thin. The Triple Function of Darwin's Vera Causa Logic The crucial sticking point in Darwin's argument has always been his effort to apply his "special theory," his theory of micro evolution, into a "general theory" of macro evolutionary change. 32 Even with the aid of his talent in what he called "the master art of wriggling" 33 his extension to the higher taxa (Phyla, Class, Order) of the micro processes by which breeders could develop domestic races, posed major explanatory problems - then and now. In general terms Darwin's strategy of moving from micro to macro evolution has three parts. First, Darwin folds domestication into nature and depicts nature as a 29Meyer, 112- 113. 30Meyer, 114- 130. 31Meyer, 113; Stephen Jay Gould, It's A Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of Historv, (New York: Norton &amp; Norton, 1989), Ch.

Campbell continuum of varying forms. In the course of doing this Darwin plays off the common sense knowledge of the breeder based on experience, against the expert knowledge of the naturalist based on taxonomic analysis. The effect of Darwin's epistemological play off between the breeder and the naturalist is to redefine the meaning of empirical science. This synthesis between the breeder's common sense and the naturalist's technical study Darwin uses to extend a revised breeder model to explain not just the origin of varieties and species but the origin of the higher taxa. Second Darwin redefines the motives of the received picture of science to make it appear as little more than supernaturalism reinforced by a blinkered professional practice bent on reducing natures' teeming variety to discrete and separate categories at all costs. Third, in the course of the work Darwin constructs such a vivid and compelling picture of nature as a great self-regulating machine - a picture that is by turns and sometimes at once both practical and theoretical - that not only is the possibility of catastrophes excluded but the role played by supporting evidence is significantly recontextualized and even displaced. In the limited space here we can only briefly trace and summarize representative moments in this process. Laying the Foundation: The Existence of Variation and Selection, Chapters 1-3 The epistemological center of chapter one is the section On the Breeds of the Domestic Pigeon. (Origin, 20-29). As the pigeon example opens, Darwin gives the reader several pages of exposition that characteristically are at once informative and entertaining. Having introduced the various classes of domestic pigeon and explained that breeders believe each breed to be descended from an aboriginally wild form, while naturalists trace them all from the rock pigeon, Darwin proceeds to develop an elegant reductio ad absurdum against the assumption of their multiple wild origin. Though the details of his argument are too numerous for easy summation it is noteworthy that he makes telling use of the classes of argument that will appear again in later portions of the book -including geographic distribution and the inheritance of common patterns of color and stripes that clearly indicate common ancestry. Particularly memorable in his development of inheritance is his use of own experience with breeding. The reader sees - through the virtual experience of Darwin's detailed yet readable descriptions of specific cases - that remarkable variations in numerous features have been inherited and selected by breeders. As Aristotle remarks logical appeal is persuasive because people tend to believe what they think they have seen demonstrated. Only in the final paragraph of the section does Darwin mention why he has developed this example at such length. Since the pigeon is not one of the breeds whose ancestry is disputed among professional naturalists, Darwin has developed his example without fully explaining his motive. Why has he spent his time on an uncontroversial case rather than on one where the experts disagree and his examination might have made a contribution to the literature? Darwin explains that he has "discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some ... length because when I first kept pigeons ... I felt fully as much difficulty in believing that they could ever have descended from a common parent, as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard to the many species of finches, or other large groups of birds, in nature."(Origin, 28)</page><page sequence="11">The Comic Frame and the Rhetoric of Science 37 Darwin's aim is to expose what he takes to be gratuitous and professionally enforced ignorance. First, Darwin exposes the ignorance of the breeders. "Ask, as I have asked, a celebrated raiser of Herford cattle, whether his cattle might not have descended from long-horns, and he will laugh you to scorn." (Origin, 29). Or again, "I have never met a pigeon, or poultry, or duck or rabbit fancier, who was not fully convinced that each main breed was descended from a distinct species." He then points out "The explanation" for why breeders fail to see the continuity linking the diverse forms their art creates " ... is simple: ... they ignore all general arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences accumulated during many successive generations. (Origin, 29). Darwin then turns the same critique against the naturalists. May not those naturalists who, knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than does the breeder, and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate links in the long lines of descent, yet admit that many of our domestic races have descended from the same parents - may they not learn a lesson of caution, when they deride the idea of a species in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other species? (Origin, 29) The breeders in believing in an aboriginally wild form as the ancestor of each of their variants manifest one form of typological thinking. The naturalists, however, in failing to see that wild forms are themselves descended from other and distinct wild forms manifest only a slightly more sophisticated version of the very same parochial thinking. The reader is now prepared for the real target of the analysis: "We cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in several cases, we know that this has not been their history. (Origin. 30) The issue of the Origin of Species is naturalism vs. supernaturalism. In establishing the existence of variation and selection - informally through the pigeon example Darwin has used the prevailing technological social epistemology to secure as well the reader's tacit recognition of its competence and responsibility to bring about unbounded morphological change. Chapter two consolidates the gains of chapter one by naming the enemy. Darwin notes that difficult though "species" is to define everyone knows that the term "includes the unknown element of a distinct act of creation." (Origin, 44). Though this definition may have reflected popular belief it was not the predominant view among Darwin's colleagues.34 Indeed Herschel, whose expression "the mystery of mysteries" Darwin uses in his Introduction (Origin 1) to describe the question of the origin of species, affirmed in the very letter to Charles Lyell from which Darwin took this expression, his confidence that new species were the products of natural law. 35 A similar point is made by Darwin's geological mentor Lyell in his expression "law of creation". But the problem with Darwin's colleagues is not that they believed in special creation, but that their positions were sufficiently 34See notes #6, #13, #14. 35"The origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to miraculous process ..." in Gillispie 31.</page><page sequence="12">38 John A. Campbell ambiguous as to be misrepresented as affirming that they did. With a revolution to win and the need for an unacceptable alternative to play off against his own controversial views Darwin invented the theory of special creation thereby defining the position from which any attack on his own theory would emanate.36 By Darwin's definition naturalists are supernaturalists. Much of the burden of the chapter is to show how the supernaturalistic premise Darwin misrepresents as framing the soul and core of prior tradition is reproduced in the course of work-a- day taxonomic practice. Darwin quickly proceeds to show how differences between individuals and the differences among and between subvarieties are not welcomed by naturalists for they create problems of classification. (Origin, 45-50). In the middle of chapter two Darwin offers the reader a counter part of the breeder/naturalist epistemic play off so potent in chapter one. With devastating effectiveness Darwin catalogues the differences of interpretation among experts concerning where a variety leaves off and where a species begins. Darwin then describes the steps an hypothetical "young naturalist" would go through in learning his craft. (Origin, 50-51) As his description makes clear the overriding professional aim of taxonomy is to make discriminations that will win the acceptance of peers. His account of how a naturalist "makes" species through interpretive decisions is a brilliant pioneering and intentionally reductionist study in the sociology of science. What the reader ends with is a picture of a profession that starts with a metaphysical premise and, driven by a professional interest in ignoring differences (all the while through professional disputes recognizing them), produces the illusion of nature as a series of fixed types. Mid-way through the chapter, somewhat reminiscent of Mark Anthony and Caesar's will, Darwin returns to the question of definition and defines a variety as an "incipient species" and a species as "a more or less permanent variety". (Qrigin, 50, 54). That he has his sights trained on the higher taxa is made particularly clear in his elegantly simple assault on the massive reality of taxonomic difference. Darwin observes - anticipating his later arguments in chapters 10 and 11 on geographic distribution - that it is the larger genera that have the greatest number of varieties and species. These he tellingly calls a "manufactory" and speaks of them as "manufacturing" and as having "manufactured" still other varieties and species. (Origin, 56) This redefinition facilitates the abductive inference on the part of the reader that (whatever the mechanism exactly) it simply must be the case that varieties and species are made by a process intelligible to the common sense of technological reason. Darwin's technological image "manufactory" or "manufacturing", is augmented and reinforced by his complementary rural maxim making the same point "where many large trees grow, we expect to find saplings." (Origin, 55). The same logic whereby the breeder makes new breeds - sometimes "unconsciously" (and everyone knows the fecundity of trees in spreading saplings) - so the larger genera would be the 36Rhetorical inventions are almost never from whole cloth otherwise they would be mere lies. In Aristotelian terms we can say that in characterizing his opponents as "creationists" Darwin was not hitting on the first principles of any existing science. He was reinventing convention for purposes of rebutting an easy, unsubtle and unscientific target rather than a hard, subtle and scientific one.</page><page sequence="13">The Comic Frame and the Rhetoric of Science 39 most productive of species and incipient species! One may challenge Darwin on technical grounds and one may critique his sociological account of taxonomists by the simple expedient of starting with the higher taxa - the reality of different kinds - and working down (thereby relativizing border disputes rather than allowing them to define the enterprise). But one would have to be tone deaf to the technological current in the soul of Victorian culture not to recognize the suasory force of this chapter. When Darwin comments "As Fries has well remarked, little groups of species are generally clustered like satellites around certain other species." (Origin, 57) he has tied his revolution to the locus classicus of scientific revolution. Through his telling image of "satellites" Darwin invites the abductive inference that through his account of breeding and classification he is doing for biology what Galileo did for astronomy through his account of the "Medicean stars". 37 The sociological reductionism and industrial triumphalism of chapter two are extended and augmented in chapter three. The final lines of chapter two "And thus, the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into groups subordinate to groups." (Origin, 59) provide the macro context for the reader's understanding of the engine of evolutionary change introduced in chapter three. The close parallel between Darwin's introduction to chapter three and the nearly identical ground - and closely parallel language - of chapter four exemplify further the tension between Darwin's formal vera causa logic and his informal logic aimed at securing immediate assent. In the scheme of Darwin's vera causa exposition, as we have seen, chapter three completes the "existence" step. As the language of the introductions to both chapters three and four show - even at the risk of outright repetition (indeed through the very use of repetition) - Darwin is at pains to encourage his reader's immediate assent to his larger agenda. Each chapter begins with the summary of the preceding argument (especially the relation among variation, struggle and the origin of species) and sets the agenda of the chapter to come through the generous use of rhetorical questions. In the second paragraph of chapter three Darwin concludes an introductory series of rhetorical questions "How do those groups of species, which constitute ... distinct genera ... arise?"(Origin, 61). In chapter four his topic sentence asks again a question repeatedly addressed, albeit in a different context, in the chapter three "How will the struggle for existence, discussed too briefly in the last chapter, act in regard to variation?"(Origin, 80). We cannot here comment in detail on these extremely rich chapters. In previous work I have attended too closely to the obvious rhetorical features which together make them form a natural series of stepping stones. (Darwin referred to chapter four as "the key-stone of my arch,"38). Here I want to stress their abductive coherence - how in presenting evidence for the "existence" and "competence" of superfecundity and variation they elicit belief that these forces must have been responsible for unbounded morphological change. 37Jean Dietz Moss, Novelties in The Heavens: Rhetoric and Science in the Copernican Controvry, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993),80. 38LL1, 511.</page><page sequence="14">40 John A. Campbell Chapter three begins on an analytic note that clearly indicates how Darwin means to fuse the issues of "existence" and "responsibility." Before entering on the subject of this chapter, I must make a few preliminary remarks, to show how the struggle for existence bears on natural Selection. It has been seen in the last chapter that amongst organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual variability; indeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed. (Origin, 60) Even as in the course of chapter one Darwin used the analogy of the breeder to fold variation and selection back into nature, here "variation" and "selection" are to be folded into "struggle". Paralleling the same tactic of chapter one - in which Darwin framed his pigeon example as a defense of the universal opinion of naturalists in the descent of domestic breeds from the rock pigeon - Darwin here positions himself as merely defending a commonplace that all organisms vary. The meaning of Darwin's conceptual minimalism becomes clear as Darwin extrapolates the implications of this seemingly minor concession. I here pass over the rhetorical questions by which Darwin evokes the tradition of natural theology he is about to subvert.39 Two passages from this chapter invite our attention. The first is Darwin's initial description of the mechanism which powers natures' "manufactory" of species. The face of Nature may be compared to a yielding surface, with ten thousand sharp wedges packed close together and driven inwards by incessant blows, sometimes one wedge being struck, and then another with greater force. In the wake of this striking exemplification of the unstaunchable reality of competition as a force at once familiar and ubiquitous Darwin immediately proceeds to stress how ignorant we are of the very thing he has so clearly illuminated. "What checks the natural tendency of each species to increase in number is most obscure." and again "We know not exactly what the checks are in even one single instance." (Qrigin, 67) The chapter sketches a series of vivid, memorable and evocative instances of the fierce relentlessness of competition in nature. Darwin takes the reader to the estate of a relation and shows the effects of a fence in transforming what had been a blasted heath to a self-sown forest of scotch firs and of the increase of insects and birds this has occasioned. He tells stories from the new world of how when an American forest is cut down the same order and proportion of kinds of trees grows up once again - as evidenced by the forests which have covered old Indian mounds. The reader is instructed into how minute is the "warfare" of kind with kind and of the "war between insect and insect - between insects, snails, and other animals with birds and beasts of prey - all striving to increase and all feeding on each other ..." (Origin, 75). Encyclopedic as has been the increase in the reader's knowledge Darwin's emphasis remains on ignorance. This curious tactic reaches its rhetorically most decisive expression in our second major passage - the final paragraph of the chapter. Darwin has the reader imagine a plant or animal in "a new country amongst new competitors" with a climate like that in its old home. Even in these circumstances 39See my account in John Angus Campbell, "Scientific Revolution and the Grammar of Culture: The Case of Darwin's Origin," Ouarterly Journal of Speech, Vol. 72., (1986), esp. 361- 366.</page><page sequence="15">The Comic Frame and the Rhetoric of Science 41 so closely parallel to the old ones "the conditions of its life will generally be changed in an essential manner." (Origin, 78). Darwin invites the reader to share a thought experiment in trying to give the plant or animal some new characteristic that would enable it to prosper in its new country. It is good thus to try in our imagination to give any form some advantage over another. Probably in no single instance should we know what to do, so as to succeed. It will convince us of our ignorance on the mutual relations of all organic beings; a conviction as necessary, as it seems to be difficult to acquire. (Origin, 78). From his description one would think that the experiment must inevitably fail. But the very next sentence gives us the clue to the rhetorical meaning of the example. All that we can do, is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being is striving to increase at a geometrical ratio; that each at some period of its life, during some season of the year, during each generation or at intervals, has to struggle for life, and to suffer great destruction. As the final line of the chapter unmistakably indicates, what Darwin offers is not ignorance, but pious ignorance. When we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no rear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy and the happy survive and multiply. (Origin, 78-79). The reader now has answers to the rhetorical questions with which the chapter began and is becoming accustomed to believing in the efficacy of causes that are best known by analogy - but which are too close and too embedded in the web of ordinary experience to be doubted. Under Darwin's pious humility is a new and dogmatic form of belief linking the logic of the social order to the logic of nature. "Competence" and Darwin's Superstructure of Image and Concept: Chapters 4-8 Diverse as are the topics of these chapters the specific rhetorical task common to them all is to strengthen the reader's commitment to naturalism and to provide a series of virtuoso examples of the "competence" of natural selection to bring about results that at first a reader would regard as beyond its power. In these middle five chapters following the paradigm of the pigeons in chapter one, in acknowledging the competence of natural selection, the reader tacitly recognizes its "responsibility" as well. Imagistically Darwin's "arch" is not complete until the famous often cited figure of chapter four. Thanks to the language he has reconstituted from whole fragments of Malthus, his own redefinition of "struggle" and traditional natural theology and numerous tacit commitments linking domestication and nature, directionless struggle, variation and selection, Darwin's claim is strictly correct: It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. (Origin, 84) "It may [indeed] be said" for the rhetorical reconstitution of language and meaning which is the gift and achievement of the chapters preceding makes this</page><page sequence="16">42 John A. Campbell extraordinary statement of the core of his theory sayable - and as a social, if not conceptual, proposition intelligible - even believable. With his personification of nature as the breeder Darwin has achieved not precision but maximal indeterminacy. Darwin has constructed a semantic range of meanings for "selection" that extends from a conscious valuing intelligence or demi-urge through the hyper-acute perception of the English breeders through "savages" - scarcely more self-aware than unconscious nature - to the strict and literal laws of Malthusian population pressure. As a result "selection" has no fixed meaning but is an indeterminate point along a semantic continuum subject to renegotiation with each new use. Following his sections "On the intercrossing of individuals" and on "extinction" Darwin approaches the heart of his chapter, indeed of his book in his section "Divergence of character". This section is at once a vindication of Aristotle's view that rhetoric is , at best, a substitute for teaching, and an object lesson in the indelible trace of the rhetorical even where it seems to disappear. The conceptual aim of this technically dense and demanding section is to enable the reader to visualize the working of Darwin's Malthusian logic across space and time and to understand how a process that on the one hand is random on the other could eventuate in what appears to be directional change. A general reader could follow Darwin's leading/misleading analogy with domestic breeding to the very borders of the visual diagram that is the centerpiece of this section, but no further. Only a serious conceptual grasp of Darwin's Malthusian logic will enable a reader to understand what is at issue in "Divergence of Character". Early in the section Darwin asks "How, then, does the lesser difference between varieties become augmented into the greater difference between species?" (Qrigin, 111). And again, since breeders breed for some desired characteristic. "... how ... can any analogous principle apply in nature?" (Origin, 112). Here where the abstract character of the Malthusian logic is at its most severe Darwin engineers some conceptual relief through a higher level comparison with domestic breeding. Darwin points out nature favors diversification so that "the more diversified ... the descendants of any one species...in structure, constitution and habits, by so much more ... will they be ... enabled to seize on ... many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature ...." (Qrigin, 112) The conceptual beauty of this passage is that it redeems Darwin's earlier personification of the breeder by substituting objective niches or places that are the locus of survival or extinction (for the individual or for the type) for the breeder's choice. While the reader has more than enough examples at this point in the work to understand the principle of "selection" in nature, a further analogy from domestication makes his theory seem like an explicit statement of what farmers have always known. "It has been experimentally proved" Darwin observes, that if a patch of ground is sown with only one kind of seed it can support but a limited amount of vegetation. But if that same ground is sown with many different - and diverse - kinds the total quantity of herbage supported by that patch will be significantly greater. Anyone reflecting on how a market economy diversifies as it expands would find something intuitively "right" with this analogy. That the same process that favors change would bring about the gradual extinction of the lesser improved forms is equally - and intuitively - obvious.</page><page sequence="17">The Comic Frame and the Rhetoric of Science 43 The conceptual climax of Darwin's Origin is the great chart in the middle of chapter four. In later sections of his book as in his personal letters Darwin refers the reader concerned about the general perspective afforded by his view to this diagram. It is here that Darwin provides a schematic summary of his combined principles as they would act over space and time. (See Figure 1) The letters "A-L" represent the species of a genus large in its own country. The letters are unevenly spaced as Darwin points out to show that the species of such a genus would resemble one another to unequal degrees. The space between the fourteen horizontal lines to the right of the figure represent a thousand generations, though Darwin adds that it would be better if they represented "ten thousand generations." The diverging dotted lines extending from "A" represent "A's" two main branches with the subbranching fans representing their diverging offspring. Darwin notes that only the most divergent of "A" and "I's" offspring would reach the first horizontal line which marks the point at which a systematist would recognize the form as sufficiently different from its parent as to rank as a distinct variety. These new varieties "al and ml", Darwin notes, will inherit the advantages that made their common parent "A" more numerous and will as well enjoy the advantages that made the genus large in its particular country. Assuming the same conditions hold that favored the diversification of this form, the form will continue to vary and to diverge as did its predecessors until given another thousand or ten thousand generations a2 and m2 will be formed and these will be as different from al and ml as a2 and ml were from "A". As the diagram shows both the "a"' and "nm" lines in turn give rise to further diverging varieties. These offshoots Darwin represents by "d" and "k" in the case of "A" and "s", "i", "k" and "1" in the case of "M". As the various dead-end branches illustrate not all of these newly forming branches succeed. The letters and variously diagonal lines at the top represent a simplified version of the continuation of this process for an indefinite period. As one can see by glancing across the top of the diagram and counting the fully branched lower portion of the diagram and the idealized diagonal lines above them one would eventually - after fourteen thousand or fourteen hundred thousand generations - have eight clearly differentiated species all ultimately descended from A. Though abstract in form the chart is amazingly concrete. The previous images Darwin has established now burgeon in the reader's imagination, insinuating themselves along its lines requiring only the syntactic cartilage of colorless exposition to link the conceptual bones. Darwin's relentless interleaving of examples from domestication to nature back to domestication, his image of the breeder, of machinery and his persistent use of images of war and competition have thoroughly domesticated problematic and controversial ideas. So completely has Darwin stretched the limits of linguistic/semantic convention in the sections preceding that he has now cleared a conceptual space where ideas made over familiar by repetition may be laid one upon the other like bricks. As the expository temperature of the work approaches "rhetoric degree 0" the boredom that begins to numb the reader is, in effect, one of Darwin's greatest rhetorical achievements. As Galileo demonstrated, to bring about an intellectual revolution, all else being equal, a challenger has only to argue convention to a draw. In such circumstances the yawn of a reader nodding off may be a surer mark of success than the fickle nod of conscious approval. The increasing rarity of the personified breeder image in the</page><page sequence="18">44 John A. Campbell Origin, does not announce its impending death, but its apotheosis into a cliche- the highest status to which a rhetorical conceit may aspire. In the course of his summation Darwin warns the reader of the methodological prohibition against eating the epistemological fruit from his diagrammatic tree. Whether natural selection has really thus acted in nature, in modifying and adapting the various forms of life to their several conditions and stations, must be judge of by the general tenour and balance of evidence given in the following chapters. (Oii, 127). But if one reads on a few lines, this warning seems purely formal and indeed empty. But we already see how it entails extinction; and how largely extinction has acted in the world's history, geology plainly declares. Natural selection also leads to divergence of character... . Thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species, will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greader differences between species of the same genus, or even of distinct genera. (Origin, 128). Hypothetical and schematically idealized though the diagram is, there can be little doubt that Darwin regards the relations it depicts as real. The diagram, though technically hypothetical, has to be true for it is the only naturalistic explanation for the clustering of groups around groups in endless cycles to which Darwin first drew the reader's attention in chapter two. Darwin notes "On the view that each species has been independently created, I can see no explanation of this great fact." Whereas the pattern of nature "is explained through inheritance and the complex action of natural selection, entailing extinction and divergence of character, as we have seen illustrated in the diagram." (Origin, 129). The move from chapter four to chapter five is in part a step backward. Chapter five completes Darwin's meditation on heredity begun in the opening pages of chapter 1 preceding his example of the pigeons. Five is of interest from the standpoint of the history of argumentation for in this chapter we see Darwin doing science- heredity - in the mode of a common law lawyer gathering precedents and maxims and parallel cases. So few positive laws of heredity were understood at mid-century that Darwin here functions as a casuist attempting to argue for a universal process in the language developed to handle particular and local truths. More particularly the chapter is of interest for its bold equation of the principle of descent from common ancestry with scientific reason itself. Toward the very end of the chapter Darwin takes the example of the horse family and noting the universal appearance of stripes on the various species invites his reader to join him in imagining a common ancestor. If the reader refuses he is invited to join the ancient cosmogonists in believing that fossil shells in the mountains were created specially to mock living shells on the sea-shore. Chapter five but makes emphatic what was already explicit at the end of chapter four (or even chapter one) - one either believes in common descent by natural selection or one believes God is a liar. "To admit this view [to deny ancestry] is ... to reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown, cause. It makes the works of God a mere mockery and deception;" (Origin, 167) One could scarcely ask for a clearer example of Eugene Garver's concept of "stable innovation" - the technique by which a new style ruler</page><page sequence="19">The Comic Frame and the Rhetoric of Science 45 approximates legitimacy by timely and selective invocation of the maxims and traditions his regime subverts.40 Chapters 6-8 form a unit within the larger "competence" unity of chapters 4-8. Their rhetorical aim is to rebut and amplify. Explicitly the chapters are organized to answer a miscellaneous series of objections. At the beginning of chapter six "Difficulties on theory" Darwin sets before his reader a great agenda of potential objections. "Some of them" as he notes "are so grave that to this day I can never reflect on them without being staggered." (Origin, 171). Often overlooked or downplayed in uncritical approaches to Darwin's intellectual virtues is the second part of this statement which is fully important as the first. "but to the best of my judgment, the greater number are only apparent, and those that are real are not, I think, fatal to my theory." (Origin, 171). Chief among the objections Darwin lists are the following: 1. "... why, if species have descended from other species by invisibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms?" 2." How could an animal like a bat be formed "by the modification of some animal with wholly different habits?" 3. "... can instincts be acquired and modified through natural selection?" 4. "... how can we account for species, when crossed, being sterile ..." when varieties, when crossed, are fertile? (Origin, 171, 172) The strategy Darwin adopts in addressing these objections can usefully be considered as a detailed answer to the partly dialectical, partly rhetorical question posed by the thought experiment at the end of chapter three. The genuinely dialectical component of that thought experiment was Darwin's leaving open of the question of what improvement might enable the plant or animal to increase the extent of its range. Chapter four added to the reader's knowledge and imagination a number of potential answers to that question while at the same time leaving open many intriguing and, as Darwin puts it "staggering" particulars. The general tactic of chapters 6-8 is to begin with a particular case, pose what seem to be insuperable objections, and then proceed to show - using the analogy of breeding as a foundation - that the objections can in fact be overcome. Any summation, including the present one, must do violence to Darwin's art which is always manifest in the particulars of its execution. At the risk of exaggeration one can roughly compare the narrative structure of these chapters to the cliff-hanger pattern of old-time Saturday movie matinees. The chapters unfold as a series of close escapes in which the theory of natural selection is repeatedly saved from the brink of destruction. Darwin regularly pits natural selection against what seem decisive objections - and then discovers a way out. After awhile the reader comes to understand that natural selection is invincible - or if not invincible that it is at least plausible and thus Darwin battles convention to a draw. 40Eugene Garver, Machiavelli and the Histoiy of Prudence, (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1987), 22-25.</page><page sequence="20">46 John A. Campbell These chapters encourage the reader to see natural selection as a creative force. Once a reader has followed Darwin through the variations in the flanks of various known types of squirrels from slightly flattened flanks to squirrels with the flaps of membrane so developed as to let them glide, and is then asked to believe that bats or flying lemurs must have followed a similar sequence (though Darwin notes we have not the slightest positive evidence in either case) or when the reader is taken through the range of possible transitional structures (in various lineages) of the eye - from a nerve sensitive to light to the eye of an eagle - even a skeptical reader cannot help but feel the theoretic/imaginative force of Darwin's argument from progressive increments. "Responsibility" and the Reader's Sense of the Probable: Chapters 9-13 The imaginative psycho-rhetorical importance of Darwin's examples in chapters 6- 8 is fully manifest in chapter nine "On the Imperfections of the Geological Record". Chapters 9-12 have the vera causa task of showing how the patterns we do find in nature argue for the actual "responsibility" of natural selection". If in these chapters Darwin's task is to compare his theory against the "facts" it would seem that in leading off with a chapter on geology he slams straight against, as it were, a "hard facts" wall. Darwin points out to the reader that the facts of geology go directly against his theory and if any one wants a good reason to reject it geology supplies the reason. But it is easy, and common, to make too much of this concession. As in the chapters preceding, the theory once again escapes. The wall turns out to be a picket fence in bad repair. The continuous wall with the missing transitional forms Darwin's theory requires has been destroyed - he explains - not by great catastrophes and rapid creations but by the slow vandalism of time. Darwin invites the reader to leap over the "hard" facts or crawl through the large gaps. The leap or the "wriggle" Darwin requires of the reader in chapter nine is not a leap or a "wriggle" in the dark. Not least of the persuasive power of Darwin's chapters 6-8 is the practice they gave the reader in filling in blanks, sometimes across relatively small and sometimes across very large gaps in the evidence. By the time Darwin's reader approaches the massive "gaps" in chapter nine he or she has become a champion pole vaulter or wriggler. Once the reader sees the geological record, rather than the theory, as imperfect it is indeed true as Darwin claims at the end of the chapter "the main objections to the theory of natural selection are greatly diminished or disappear." This is a breath taking rhetorical achievement even if it is persuasive with but a minority of readers and (at the time at least) with virtually none of Darwin's peers.41 There is no doubt that Darwin provides many important empirical reasons for believing in his theory in chapters 9-13. Darwin's point that the succession of the same type of being in changed form in the same location over time is an argument for descent is telling as is his case for modification based on geographical distribution. Even if Darwin's bio-geographic arguments are empirically stronger as supports for his micro theory than for his macro theory - their coupling with arguments based on geological succession give force to his macro theory. Artful and convincing as are many sections in his final five chapters - and particularly the way he explicitly employs the consilience of inductions from many lines of 41See, for example in Hull (1973): Bronn, 124, Pictet, 149, 150.</page><page sequence="21">The Comic Frame and the Rhetoric of Science 47 evidence to add probability to his view - the argument of the Origin requires faith and that faith is philosophic naturalism. Chapter Fourteen: One Long Argument In the end, like the propounder of any exclusivist metaphysic, Darwin anathematizes those who, finally, will not believe. The concluding chapter of the Origin begins with what seems to be Darwin's characteristic humility. Darwin notes that indeed "many and grave objections may be advanced against the theory of descent with modification through natural selection" and that "I have endeavored to give to them their full force."(Origin, 459) - as indeed he has. But these objections are to be weighed not just against the facts of nature placed in the scales of his Malthusian or vera causa logics or the abductive probabilities of retrospective causal analysis - but against the technological common sense of the industrial order. As the paragraph unfolds we find all doubts about the theory of natural selection - "though appearing to our imagination insuperably great, cannot be considered real if we admit the following propositions ...". The propositions that follow are that organs and instincts are variable and "that there is a struggle for existence leading to the preservation of each profitable deviation of structure or instinct." (Origin, 459). In the subsequent pages Darwin offers a magisterially concise account of his theory, of the objections to it, and a telling account of the advantages that accrue to science from seeing nature from the perspective it offers - as opposed to the counter supposition that the forms of life have been suddenly and specially created. That under the collegial tone and genial patience of much of the Origin is an unshakable conviction that what we call the typological perspective is an irremediable mistake - as is belief in sudden catastrophes and the sudden appearance of novel species - is made particularly clear by the following passages. "Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we willfully will not understand."(Origin, 480). Or again, "it is so easy to hide our ignorance under such expressions as the 'plan of creation,' 'unity of design', &amp; and to think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact." (Origin, 482) Or most deliciously "When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension ..."(Qrigja, 486). And most reassuringly "we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of great length."(Origin, 489). Conclusion: The Tragi-Comic Legacy of Darwin's Oki in The Origin of Species whether judged by rhetorical or philosophic standards is a work of genius. Conceptually it offers an alluring and, for its time, a compelling picture of the history of life including (implicitly) the place of the human animal within it.

Campbell been abundantly confirmed. 42 But when we come to the macro theory - the crux of the whole, relying as it does on a straight line linear extension of micro variations into unlimited macro changes - Darwin has never enjoyed undisputed consensus.43 Though Darwinism continues to be our official theory of how life ramified variously across space and time into the astonishing variety of forms we see around us and which the geological column records as having once existed, the history of the theory has been a history of drastic revisions. The tragi-comic character of Darwin's revolution is well attested by the up-hill efforts of contemporary neo-Darwinians interested in laws of organic form alternative to natural selection to correct Darwin's conceptual and rhetorical legacy. As Stuart Kaufmann has argued, laws of form supplemental to natural selection need to be re-examined for in many instances natural selection is known to be a conservative force incapable of bringing about radical morphological change. 44 In his It's A Wonderful Life Stephen Jay Gould points out that a central prediction one would make about the history of life from Darwin's celebrated chart in chapter four - that species diversity must precede taxonomic disparity - turns out to be empirically false. Using as his example the creatures of the Burgess Shale which represent a world of life just a few million years past the Cambrian explosion, Gould points out that the majority of these creatures belong to hitherto unknown taxa which stand in absolute discontinuity to anything that followed them. In short taxonomic disparity precedes species diversity. Gould goes on to identify the cone of increasing diversity, the assumption of unlimited progress and the gradualness of species extinction and appearance as three ideological fruits ripening on Darwin's taxonomic tree.45 In his book Extinctions, David Raup adds to Gould's critique of Darwin's gradualism by calling attention to the odd congruence between the received view of extinction as the result of: climatic change, sea level rise or fall, predation, epidemic disease and competitors, and the kinds of calamities that human beings are often subject to or hear about during the course of a lifetime.46 When we realize that Darwin's is as much a theory of extinctions as of origins, the reason for the vehemence of the recent opposition to the Alvarez comet theory of extinction and to Raup's own work on the periodicity of extinctions and their relation to comet showers is only too clear. Though Gould and Raup reaffirm the compatibility of the new catastrophism and the neo-Darwinian theory of punctuated equilibrium, recent work in microbiology suggests that irreducible complexity and not just unwelcome comets and the odd asteroid may pose further and more serious problems for natural selection as the central creative engine of morphological change. Mike Behe has pointed out that in Darwin's day most of the basic phenomena of biology consisted of "black boxes". Only in the last forty years has biochemistry been able to explain such basic 42Denton, 81- 86. 43Ibid, 86- 87. 44Kauffman, 24- 26. 45Stephen Jay Gould, 27- 52, 299- 308. 46David M.

Norton &amp; Co. 1991), 112- 114.</page><page sequence="23">The Comic Frame and the Rhetoric of Science 49 phenomena as how animal muscles cause movement, photosynthesis, how energy is extracted from food, how the body fights infection and how vision works. From Darwin's time through the first half of our own century such basic questions were unanswerable. When we add to our now advanced understanding of the specificity of the chemical sequencing in folded proteins, and the low probability of their occurrence, the irreducible complexity of the protein sequencing required to produce the bending motion in such molecular machines as cilia, we are faced not just with complexity but with a "complexity [that] is final and fundamental". As Behe notes "The components of cilia are single molecules. This means that there are no more black boxes to invoke." Further "Since the irreducibly complex cilium can not have functional precursors it can not be produced by natural selection, which requires a continuum of function to work."47 It is not for a rhetorical critic to comment on the likelihood of the demise or the further conceptual downsizing of Darwinism. Indeed, apart from the formidable technical issues involved, to anyone familiar with the mere rhetorical history of Darwin's theory, its radical erosion would seem highly unlikely. Nevertheless, well structured scientific world pictures (such as Aristotle's or Newton's - both of which could show their own consilience of inductions) occasionally do crash to a relatively abrupt end (or are suddenly and radically recontextualized) - when a Galileo or an Einstein bursts unexpectedly through the noosphere "with flames of incandescent terror". More often huge edifices of ideas - such as positivism - never really die. Thinking people gradually abandon them and even ridicule them among themselves, but keep the persuasively useful parts to scare away the uninformed. For example, the way philosophers of science use exploded demarcationist arguments to keep "creationism" out of the public schools. In a recent study Martin Eger finds that in the humanities grade and high school teachers have taken seriously the teaching of values through nurturing habits of critical questioning among students. 48 By contrast he finds in science a dogmatic circle- the-wagons attitude in which any dialectical engagement between the student and the received neo-Darwinian world-picture is unacceptable. Eger demonstrates that beneath the on-going local school-board battle between "creationism" and "science" is a real and little understood conflict between scientific foundationalism and the critical, antifoundationalist and liberal tradition at the heart of a dialectical/rhetorical model of learning. His essay underscores the far from merely historical interest in a critical reconsideration of Darwin's rhetoric. When the tactics that gave Darwin a momentary advantage are transformed into a permanent epistemological monopoly cognitive, philosophic, pedagogical and ethical issues that are wholly secular are brought into play and fundamental liberal values are placed at risk. The belief in typology or "rational morphology" that characterized the naturalistic outlook of Darwin's predecessors and colleagues and the associated belief in catastrophes - while having metaphysical implications - were neither of them products of the rampant supernaturalism Darwin successfully pinned on them in the rigin. Indeed these assumptions - then and now - were as rationally justified as 47Michael Behe, "Microbiology and Irreducible Complexity," Unpublished paper presented before the American Scientific Affiliation, Seattle, (August, 1993),1- 8, esp. 4- 6. 48Eger, Martin, "A Tale of Two Controversies: Dissonance In The Theory and Practice of Rationality," Zygon, Vol. 23., (1988), 291-325.</page><page sequence="24">50 John A. Campbell Darwin's own project - and empirically (as the science of cladistics claims) they were more justified. The contemporary efforts to revive the study of the laws of organic form independent of natural selection; the sometimes bitter struggle of the (oddly) young science of "extinctions" to reaffirm catastrophism; the remarkable professional silence on the evolutionary implications of the microbiological evidence for irreducible complexity49; and the on-going pedagogic debate over whether science teachers can be liberal educators (whether they will be legally allowed to use the time-honored comparative method in their teaching) - indicate the tragic power of scientific rhetoric to block and impede as well as to open fruitful paths to learning and knowledge. Given the enormous empirical as well as cultural constraints against his audience "loving" what he wanted them to see, and "seeing" what he sought to show, Darwin simply had to generate extraordinary imaginative appeal. Darwin generated his extraordinary imaginative appeal through a combination of Malthusian and vera causa logic, his consilience of inductions, his personification of the breeder, his anthropomorphic appeal to technological "common sense", his general retooling of the language, and his riveting and ingenious narrative of the capacity of natural selection to accomplish seemingly (and perhaps actually) impossible feats. Coupled with his positive realizations of his theory his brilliant and ingenuous caricature of his opponents indisputably aided him in redefining the terms of the debate. If there is an epistemically tragic element in Darwinism it is that what began as a brilliant answer to a variety of extremely daunting problems of conception, exposition and persuasion has often determined the ethics and defined the permanent epistemic and pedagogical interests of science. Indeed sometimes Darwin's achievement is confused with science itself. With Gladstone and Kitcher I too - in the end - support a comic, or at least a tragi-comic, frame for the rhetoric of science. A rigorous tragi-comic rhetorical analysis of science, friendly to science yet absolutely hostile to equating any one theory, hero - or metaphysic - with "the human epistemic project" is also our best hope to articulate and uphold an ethics of rhetoric; it alone forces us to expose what Burke, following Augustine, called "the rottenness of our perfection."50 John A. Campbell Department of Speech Communication University of Washington 49Professor Behe points out the not uninteresting fact that the J oumal of Molecuhar Evolution "that was begun specifically to deal with the topic of how evolution occurs on a molecular level" in the past ten years has published "zero papers discussing models for intermediates in the development of complex biomolecular structures." He adds "If one looks at other journals or books the story is the same." Behe, 7. 50Burke, Language As Symbolic Action, 16</page></plain_text>
