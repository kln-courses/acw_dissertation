The biggest problems with this book, like some others in this series from Academic Press, is overall integration and organization. The chapters on geology and soils contain information on the site setting that belong in the Introduction, includ- ing a general site map. A particularly frustrating point is that the chapters on geology and soils make almost no reference to one another; it is very difficult to un- derstand the relation between the strata and soils. Var- ious paleoenvironmental interpretations are offered in the sections on vertebrates (Chapter 9), soils (Chapter 10), snails (Appendix 4), and phytoliths (Appendix 5), but there is no synthesis or review of the conclusions reached. Finally, the very important conclusions on late Paleoindian projectile-point typology and tech- nology are found in the middle of Chapter 6, but not well summarized at the end of that chapter or in the concluding chapter of the book. In spite of the above-mentioned problems this vol- ume is a very important addition to the literature on Plains Paleoindians. It particularly is significant in that it provides a final report on the early work at Horer and a wealth of data based on the more recent inves- tigations. The Horner Site is sure to become a standard reference for the Cody Complex and late Paleoindian projectile-point technology. It was heartening to see that Academic Press decided to put out a paperback edition of the book, but the price is still outrageous and few but the most dedicated of Paleoindian ar- chaeologists are likely to purchase it. The Prehistory of North Carolina: An Archaeological Symposium. MARK A. MATHIS and JEFFREY J. CROW, editors, with contributions by DAVID SUTTON PHELPS, H. TRAWICK WARD, BUR- TON L. PURRINGTON, and JOFFRE L. COE. North Carolina Division of Archives and History, Department of Cultural Resources, Raleigh, 1983. xvi + 206 pp., references, index. $6.00 (paper). Reviewed by Cheryl Claassen, Appalachian State Uni- versity. This book is one of a very few syntheses of the pre- history of a coastal state or an eastern state available for a professional audience. This fact, plus the quite reasonable price, merits the purchase of this volume. The information it contains, written by the most re- spected authors in the state (four chapters and four authors) also warrants a place on your shelf. The state of North Carolina is to be applauded for funding the initial conference in March 1980 at which these four authors delivered their papers. The initial chapter focuses on the coastal plain and is written by David Phelps. After a sharp look at cul- tural resource management in the region, apparently with an axe to grind, Phelps goes on to spend the ma- jority of the chapter presenting a comprehensive chro- nology of the prehistory of the region, filling a much needed gap in the literature. It includes a brief discus- sion of the distribution of fiber-tempered ware and burial mounds. That contribution not withstanding, I found several comments and omissions of concern as well as the geographical diversity to be summarized cumbersome to the discussion. With respect to the lat- ter point, the prehistoric records of the coast and the inner coastal plain cannot be lumped conveniently on many points. For instance, his claim that sites are of the greatest density during the Archaic is not supported by data gathered from several coastal counties. It is derived from inner coastal-plain surveys. His assertion that no meaningful statements can be made concerning settlement and subsistence patterns for the Woodland reflects his failure to incorporate materials written since the second half of 1979 as much as it does a scant data base. In asserting a new ceramic chronology for a re- gion, I believe it is incumbent upon the proposer to correlate the old sequences with the new, a task which would have been facilitated greatly by a table. The final omission I noted concerns the lack of information on the body of coastal skeletal material housed by Phelps at his laboratory. We eagerly await data from this col- lection. The second chapter on the prehistory of the Pied- mont written by Trawick Ward is a joy to read. This article leads the reader through each major cultural period by referring to quantity of data available, va- lidity of surface collections, and a discussion of induc- tive and deductive logic, as well as by raising key the- oretical issues for each subsection. The Paleoindian discussion is cautious in interpretive comments and points out weaknesses in the data. The subsection on the Archaic notes the lack of shell-midden sites and the lack of archaeological and floral-community evi- dence for the seasonal transhumance often assumed for Archaic peoples. In the Woodland period subsec- tion Ward addresses (1) the transition into the period noting the cooccurrence of Savannah River points and pottery in several sites, (2) the ceramic sequence, and (3) the presence of maize and other cultigens. He could have included illustrations from a few more sites. While Ward questions much that has been printed, I was surprised by what he did not question. He spec- ifies that the theorist and excavator must realize that the major theoretical pitfall concerns the data base, not when the research question should be formulated. The data-base problems Ward articulates are preservation and integrity of spatial context. He omits excavation techniques as a variable! In his own region, the lack of flotation at one site has proved to be the explanation for the absence of maize. In what is otherwise a cau- tious article, Ward's failure to consider excavation techniques-as do the other three authors in this vol- ume-has led to the statement that maize agriculture was not important during most of the Woodland pe- riod. Several other such statements similarly suffer from a lack of consideration of excavation techniques. The third chapter was written by Burton Purrington and addresses the prehistory of western mountainous North Carolina. It contains the only published discus- sion of the prehistory of northwestern North Carolina (principally Watauga County), an area that still lacks a single prehistoric site report. He defines several geo- graphical units, each centered around a watershed, but then ignores these units in the subsequent discussion.

Most of these questions truely are useful for planning research but an occasional one will provide misguid- ance. Given the phase-by-phase organization of the chapter, it would have been more useful had Purring- ton di-cussed the amount of land surveyed systemat- ically, the techniques used on the major survey proj- ects, the estimation of the square meters actually excavated in western North Carolina, and if he had summarized some data by the geographical units out- lined. His claim for settlement-pattern data for the region was supported poorly. Inclusion of this material could have occupied the space spent on determining site significance and CRM issues that seem out of place in this article. These articles summarize different levels of knowl- edge-Ward and Coe address interpretive problems, Phelps and Purrington basic data. Each author has judged correctly, in my opinion, the most fundamental need of the region. The editors saw to it that the head- ings and subsections were consistent in presence, order, and label. Words like "Paleo-Indian" are consistent in spelling and figures, in layout and labelling. An index is provided along with a single set of references. I per- sonally found the CRM language and detail unbalanced between the papers and cumbersome in the Purrington introduction. I also think the editors should have asked for an estimation of the area excavated in each region and for more recent references. The three-year delay in the appearance of this volume largely reflects rewrite time. References as late as 1982 are to be expected- Purrington's 50 references since 1971 amount to 63 percent of all his references, Ward 52 percent, and Phelps 39 percent, if you subtract references to his own writing. Fourteen references in the entire volume post- date 1979. What is ancient and honorable in archae- ology is included here, what is new, is not. The Prehistoric Native American Art of Mud Glyph Cave. CHARLES H. FAULKNER, editor. Univer- sity of Tennessee Press, 1986. ix + 124 pp., illus- trations, references, index. $12.95 (cloth). Reviewed by John G. Douglas, Bureau of Land Man- agement. Since reading the promising 1984 preliminary report on this unmatched example of Mississippian period cave art (AmericanAntiquity 49:350-36 1), I have looked forward to a more-developed analysis. This volume might best be considered an interim or progress report. Mud Glyph Cave is a small solution cave in south- eastern Tennessee. Deep within the cave and extending for nearly 100 m, thick mud deposits on the walls are decorated with trailed and incised designs. The cave's constant temperature and high humidity keep the mud plastic and easily impressed with fingers, sticks, or oth- er implements. A lower cave passage carries stream water and protects the "gallery" passage from flooding. Many of the designs bear obvious affinity to Missis- sippian art, including "Southern Cult" motifs, known in other media from numerous Southeastern locations. They are termed "mud glyphs" in analogy with petro- glyphs, a few of which also occur in the cave. Dark surface staining, thought to be soot from torches and fires, obscures the mud's bright orange color. A few simple hearths are the sole nonart features, and no portable artifacts are present. The only uncharred or- ganic material found is a fragment of eastern red cedar. The cave's art was discovered and brought to Faulk- ner's attention in 1980. Study under Faulkner's direc- tion, supported by a National Geographic Society grant, was conducted in 1982. The 1984 report gives a good summary. Like its precursor, this report is mostly descriptive. Several brief chapters tell of the cave's discovery and exploration, its survey and mapping, the photographic recording of the glyphs, and the identification of in- cidental animal marks. A chapter on dating reports eight radiocarbon dates from the fifth to eighteenth centuries A.D.; five cluster around the mean, A.D. 1248, which is taken as a reasonable date. Chapters by Mul- ler, on the art of the cave, and by Henson, on rock art in the Tennessee Valley area, make up most of the volume's length. A brief concluding chapter by Watson gives a comparative perspective for prehistoric cave utilization in the Midsouth. Muller presents a preliminary analysis of the art's execution and style, cautioning repeatedly against pre- mature interpretations of "meaning," especially iden- tification of prehistorically rendered figures with his- toric mythic beings. He compares the Mud Glyph Cave figures stylistically and thematically with similar rep- resentations in shell and copper from around the Southeast, finding cross-dating justification for a mid- to late thirteenth-century date for the cave art. Muller's caution about one-to-one equations is well taken, but I hope it does not deter him from considering the very fundamental symbolic relations that do seem to hold through the centuries. As Watson puts it, "there are resemblances between some of the art motifs on the walls of Mud Glyph Cave and some of the basic themes in the mythology... of the Southeastern United States. An explanation of Mud Glyph Cave, therefore, necessitates attention to the descendants of its crea- tors" (p. 116). Muller often notes the ambiguities generated by bird- like elements on "anthropomorphic" and "herpeto- morphic" figures, using those terms to stress that rep- resentations are probably not humans or serpents per se, but may be purposely ambiguous. Similar mixing of attributes is common in the metaphorical conven- tions of many eastern North American narratives, where one finds oppositions among the spirit realms together with reference to natural species and substances that link the realms as intermediaries. For example, cedar and shell link dry-land and water aspects of the Earth's surface (where humans live) with the Above Earth realm; copper links Below Earth and Above Earth; all three materials have considerable ritual power. In this con- nection, I suggest that attention to the medium is po- tentially important in any examination of symbolic representation, certainly in the case of shell and copper, and I would consider this for the mud itself. Not only is subterranean location significant, so might the mud's 205</page></plain_text>
