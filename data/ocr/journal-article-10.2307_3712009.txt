Yet as James McClendon has pointed out, any worldview, including our own, is ultimately based on faith. Guthrie would like to divide worldviews into false anthropomorphic faiths and true non anthropomorphic ones. To do so requires omniscience, hardly one of those faculS ties that God has granted us. James V. Spickard University of RedEmds Sex, P7iests, and Power: Anatomy of A Crisis, by A. W. RICHARD S1PE. New York: Brunner/ Mazel Publishers, 1995, xiv + 220 pp. $24.95. A. W. Richard Sipe, an ordained Roman Caiolic priest, now retired from active miniso try and a psychotherapist, has written this book as a companion piece to his earlier A secret world: Sexuality and the search for celibacy (Brunner/Mazel, 1990). That previous volume was much more statistical, examining the reS sults of interviews with hundreds of priests and many more with other persons who possessed first-hand knowledge of the sexual/celibate ad- justment of Catholic priests (over 1800 respon- dents altogether) . The latter topic in A secret life subsumed a wide range of behaviors, from ho- mosexual andheterosexual practices (including affairs with women parishioners and fellow clergy, pedophilia, and ephebophilia) to mas- turbation, pomography, transvestism, bestial- ity, exhibitionism, and even AlDS. Celibacy as institutionalized in the Church of Rome and the former's correlates formed the foci of Sipe's earlier volume. In Sex, p7iests, andpowerSipe's focus shifts to the more sociological lens of organizational power. Specifically, the author examines how the Roman Catholic Church is caught up in an "epic crisis" (the author's words) between, on the one hand, an allegedly celibate clergy that more often than is known betrays its ideals and, on the other, an increasingly cynical, aggres- sive, and at times exploited laity. The recent 1980s-1 990s scandalsofpriestly pedophilia, maintains Sipe, are primarily symp- toms of a flawed, unraveling, ecclesiastical power structure, one that no longer can even replace its own clergy. Ultimately, as Sipe wrote in his first book, the problem continually returns to the system of celibacy which began with Rome's proclamation after the Second Lateran Council in 1139 that celibacy be a requirement for . . . Orolnatlon. Sipe's prognostications are ominous (and despite his clinical orientation, he provides supportive statistics from a number of credible sources). True, clerical celibacy of a majority versus the hypocrisy and double lives of just some clergy might be one thing. But the wide- spread sexual corruption of vast proportions of the Roman Catholic ecclesia is another. And the issue of a rapidly growing homosexual ele- ment in the clergy aside, the statistic that per- haps as many as one-half the clergy at any given time are not living up to their vows bodes poorly for the Church in the next century. Meanwhile, an outraged laity is being sen- sitized and mobilized, not just to form victims' advocacy groups, but also to become punitive against its Church, with disastrous financial consequences for the latter. At the same time, Sipe draws on current research (including his own) to remind the reader that there is a broader pattern behind the recent pedophilia scandal. As he notes (p. 45): 'sFour times as many priests involve themselves with adult women, and twice the number of priests involve themselves with adult men." Sociologists can (and have) been critical with psychotherapist Sipe's methodology. He does not possess random sample survey data but rather extensive samples of convenience and judgmental samples of clinical studies gathered over one-and-one-half decades. After all, he is not a survey researcher, but in reply, what do his critics have to counter his estimatesw Sipe has been studying and formulating estimates and warnings for an uninterested, nonresponsive ecclesiastical audience since the mid-1970s.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 105 Moreover, Sipe (as a former insider to the American Roman Catholic hierarchy) makes no attempt to compare his data withnon-Catho- lic samples (which in any event are few and far between, and mostly as clinical). American Protestantism cries out for similar studies. And for most sociologists' tastes Sipe prob ably relies too much on both the Freudian perspective as well as ideas from sociobiologist Edward O. Wilson. Nevertheless, there is a lot of sociologi- cally relevant material in this volume, and it should be digested by that small but growing number of sociologists who are seeking to link the sociology of religion to our other subdisci- plines such as deviance, mental illness and addictions, and formal organizations.

In this book Frederick Ferre makes a stimu lating contribution to both the debates over religion and science and over the nature of modemity. He argues that we are living at the end of the modern era and (if humanity is to survive) thebeginningofa postmodemage. For him modernity is defined by the consciousness of the industrialized gNorth," a consciousness decisively shaped by science. Flaws in the mod em consciousness are destroying the environ- ment and will inevitably bring about the end of modemity itself. Religion, in the form of a postS modem &amp;ith, is the key to surviving the period of transition and creating a new mythos. Ferre begins with a functionalist definition of religion as that which is centered on primary values and in which feelings, perceptions, beS liefs, and behaviors are more important than doctrines. Modemscience,hesays, ismorethan a methodology for describing empirical reality. It is both grounded in primary values and ex- tends beyond empirical observation to form a metaphorical way of understanding the world, what he calls a religious world model. ScierOn is the religious world model of the modem consciousness. The problem with scientism is that its obsession with quantity and Uobjective" consciousness alienates us from concerns for quality, its reductionism alienates us from per- ception of the whole, and its fixation uport technique alienates us from humanistic visions of the universe. This is not, however, another romanticist diatribe against science and technology. Ferre is radical, but not extreme. He appreciates the insights of empirical science and understands that human beings are dependent upon tech nology. He is sharply critical of those religious groups which attempt to substitute religious doctrine for scientific findings (the title of the book comes from a sermon remembered by his father, in which the local preacher condemned the use of lightening rods). What is needed, he says, is to liberate science and technology from scientism and technolatry and to develop a new paradigm built upon creativity, limits, and ho- lism. He suggests that ecology provides such a model for postmodem science. The path to a postmodern consciousness, Ferre argues, lies through religion. Much of his book is an examination of myis, bot h those of modemism and those which offer potential for liberation. While he recognizes value in premodem science and gNew Agew mysticism and magic, he does not see much hope in them. We simply cannot pretend the modem age did not happen and try to tum back the clock. A new consciousness must be posanodem. The only traditions in the gNorth" which have ie potential to move the whole socieq through the period of transition are Judaism and Chris- tianity, and then only if they are rethought and remythed. Ferre calls for a gaultimythic organicism" derived from Whitehead's process philosophy as the best hope for developing a postmodern faith. A distinguished philo60pher of religion,</page></plain_text>
