<plain_text><page sequence="1">90 Western American Literature Ulzana . By James R. Oison. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company 1973. ix + 307 pages. $6.95.) Were it not for the current interest in things Indian, it is a safe bet that James R. Olson's first novel, Ulzana , would never have been published. It is a misguided venture from beginning to end, and though the author's sincerity and goodwill are incontestable, his book is woefully inept. Ulzana tells the story of a "typical" Apache warrior of the post-Civil War period, following him through a series of events, historical and otherwise, that seem all too familiar. We learn at tedious length of Ulzana's typical Apache childhood, adolescence and middle-age. We meet his typical wife with her typical Apache background (two-pages' worth of instant ethnology), who bears him a typical Apache son. Everything is typical because Olson's characters are types, not people. They are names without substance, anthro- pological and historical composites devoid of individuality and life. The novel, in short, is an outright failure as an attempt to portray believable human beings, and it might be worthwhile to consider why. First is the matter of style. Some novelists have tried to capture an elusive, poetic quality in the Indian character through naturalistic similes and metaphors - a tradition that stretches back in time at least to Cooper. Others have abandoned the more ornate approach for a simple, spare style intended to convey the innate dignity of natural man. Olson, on the whole, has adopted the latter strategy, but he does not have the skill to carry it off, and thus what is meant to be profound and meaningful is merely flat and trite. His prose is studded with clichés as bullets "buzz like angry bees," sparkles dance in a girl's eyes, the hot blood of youth pounds through veins, warriors strike "with savage fury," crush the enemy "under flashing hoofs," "die in vain," and are "herded like cattle" on trains. In glaring contrast to the usual spartan prose, the sun never seems to set without inspiring a lush rhapsody as "molten fingers of red and orange" probe the sky, "touching, then staining the cotton clouds with fiery hues." Olson's anthropomorphism embraces all nature. The desert landscape keeps devour- ing the sinking red ball of the sun, while "hungry clouds" swallow whole mountain ranges (sometimes the mountains just "wear clouds like hats"), "victorious shadows" race across the desert, the sun's dying rays paint the tips of mountains, and one day the warm sun even consents to lay "a nostal- gic hand on Ulzana's back." Ridicule is easy, of course, and my point is more serious: the clichés flow not only because Olson's stylistic resources are meagre, but because he has no deeper insights to offer. Thus human experience for him reduces itself to the obvious, and his language mirrors his level of perception. We are solemnly told, for instance, that "there are some things more important than life or death"; "If a thing's worth living for, it's worth dying for"; and "A man who has learned how to die has learned much." We are also told that a dead woman once "laughed and loved and lived," that "what</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 91 had been . . . would never be again," that "everything was the same, yet different," and that Ulzana, at one point, realizes he has "flung his youth into an empty void." Indeed, all of Ulzana's reflections on the meaning of life ("Life was a river, and he had been a pine needle, carried by a current he could not fight"), love ("a vague longing that was like a dream"), and death ("Death was but a sleep, and in sleep there was no pain or suffering") are embarrassingly banal. Olson even presumes (twice, in fact) to have Ulzana sum up the human condition in a sentence: "A man was born, walked under the sun, slept beneath the cover of countless living stars, breathed, ate, talked, joked, and then was no more." It is out of a mishmash of just such platitudes that the reader is expected to construct some under- standing of the inner workings of the book's characters. The task, needless to say, is hopeless. Besides the insuperable burden of its style, Ulzana suffers from a basic structural flaw. Even as he struggles to portray a typical Apache warrior, Olson cannot resist introducing a counterbalancing white hero of sorts, Lieutenant Greighton, whose chapters are not merely pointless but wrong- headed intrusions since they wrench the novel off course, adding nothing to Ulzana's story while leaving the novel's narrative viewpoint in shambles. (And what kind of double standard is it, anyway, that permits historical figures to appear in the novel if they are Indian, but not if they are white? This inconsistency results in Geronimo sitting down to negotiate terms of surrender with a "General James Harrison" who, Olson informs us in his Epilogue, is actually General George Crook. He then proceeds to recount Crook's subsequent career, abandoning a fiction as transparent as it was inexplicable. ) It is customary at the end of a review to strive for a measure of balance by meting out both praise and criticism before offering a final assessment. The simple truth is that Ulzana is a very bad novel. Someone already made the mistake of publishing it ; you need not compound the error by reading it. BRIAN W.
