It was originally bought from a na tive of Copan by Dr. Albert Gage, who then gave it to Dr. Rudolph Matas. Finally Matas gave the sculpture as a loan to the Middle American Research Institute (Accession No. 39-729). The piece was obviously taken from Copan before the law prohibiting the export of archaeological objects came into effect. The head is carved from the greenish tuff used for sculpture and masonry in and around Copan, but the . Side view of the fragmentary head. darkening of the surface of the stone is unusual. A written commentary by William Fash (dated January 17, 1985) on the back of the filecard attributes this darkening to the fact that the piece was in the possession of a "native." Besides of a few chipped-off areas the carved surface of the stone is fairly well preserved, but the upper part of the head is broken off above the eyes, as well as the left side of the chin and the tip of the nose. The head originally seems to have been part of a larger sculpture. Compared to the known fa9ade sculpture heads from Copan this head is very small (H. 13.1 cm, W. 12.3 cm, L. 13.5 cm). The protuberance visible on the back of the head is its neck, not a tenon, as indicated by its round section and its angle to the face. Thus the head resembles those of a number of small figures known from the stelae commissioned by Copan's thirteenth ruler Waxaklajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and those of K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil, the fifteenth ruler. These monuments belong to a sculptural tradition known for carvings in a very detailed and vivid style, deeply carved and almost three-dimensional. They include Stelae 4, A, B, C, D, F, H, M, N, and architectural sculpture like, for example, that of Structure 10L-22 (Maudslay 1889— 1902, 1; Fash 1992; Baudez 1994). The general shape and proportions of the face are anthropomorphic and that of an aged male. But the bulbous eyes and the large incisor tooth point clearly to a supernatural being. Although the remaining parts of the sculpture are missing and its original context is unknown, some diagnostic traits of the being represented allow its identification. The preserved facial features are shared by several supernatural beings known from Maya art. But the "cruller" around the eyes and the remains of the so-called "shell-beard" allow a clear identification as the nocturnal and underworldly aspect of the sungod, a fire god also known as the "Jaguar God of the Underworld" who is the god of the number 7 and the patron of the Haab month Wo. Copan Stela F shows the portrait of Waxaklajuun Ub'aah K'awiil impersonating this deity who is surrounded by a number of little figures representing beings of the nocturnal underworldly sphere. Of three small figures - two on the side and one on top of the headdress - the heads are lost. But before surely attributing the head published here to Stela F or another monument at Copan a closer inspection of the original sculptures - both the head and the stela - is necessary.
