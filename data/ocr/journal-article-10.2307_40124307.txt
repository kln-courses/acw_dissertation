<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Conception of Life in the Art of Pasternak By RIMVYDAS SILBAJORIS is difficult to conceive of life as some- thing that extends beyond the limits of one's consciousness of his own self. In order to experience personally the reality of oth- ers, people must resort to some medium which could, like the ether postulated by eighteenth-century science, carry the signals of life across the void between the individ- ual "I" and whatever else, outside of one's self -awareness, might also be a living thing. Such a medium can be observation and analogy, question and response, an entity constructed with the participation of others, for instance science or a social organism, or an entity conceived essentially in solitude but fulfilled in communication with others, such as art. Art can thus become an instru- ment by which to overcome man's existen- tial solitude. It can communicate, make real, other people's experience of being personally alive and thus be a unifying force among men, similar to love. The special achievement of Boris Pasternak is that his art conveys still another experience, namely that there is really only one totality, called life, to which we all belong. To Pasternak, life is not a statistical con- cept, a sum total of individual existences, absolute and hermetical, like grains of sand, but rather, like the sea, it is a single dy- namic entity, on the surface of which you and I are its configurations. Obviously, such a notion of life does not belong to the category of propositions open to scientific scrutiny. It is an artistic experience - a blend of emotion and thought transformed into systems of images. It is also a cumulative experience, arrived at by means of a series of artistic insights. In Pasternak's development as a writer there have been revelations born of a meta- phor, inevitabilities suggested by the rhyth- mic recurrences of prosodic features in verse, and perspectives unfolding within the structural relationships between plot and idea in a novel. His conception of life thus emerges gradually from the very tech- niques of his art as much as it does from</page><page sequence="2">210 BOOKS ABROAD his world view, because his artistic devices in themselves are already ideas formulated in terms of feelings. Pasternak was especially quick to sense the possibilities of so constructing his poetic images as to suggest a unique relationship between separate and sometimes disparate things - a relationship which amounts to the description of poetry and life as one and the same ultimate reality. This is why the very process of writing a poem often en- tailed for him the bringing together of concepts, objects, and ideas not otherwise logically comparable into a special co-pres- ence in the artistic dimension. To say, for instance, as Pasternak did in one poem, that "I fed a flock of piano keys from my hand" is to substitute the reality of a highly complex emotional experience for the mere- ly physical one of fingers touching the keys. That inner reality, the nourishment of music by the artist's passion, is in itself art, is life in one of its innumerable embodi- ments. In such a context, the very laws of nature become significant, and in this sense real, only when the power of a poetic image can transform them into descriptions of human experience. Thus, in a poem depict- ing the absence of the beloved as if it were a physical emptiness in the mind, Pasternak speaks of "this onslaught of sorrow, roaring today like quicksilver in a Torricelli vacu- um." Conversely, the distortion of physical phenomena in a poetic image can reveal new ways to understand a human feeling. In Pasternak's line: "the thunderstorm, like a priest, burned up the lilac bush," what we may physically see is the sudden brightness of lilac blossoms against the dark, in a flash of lightning. To say that this "burns up" the lilac is to distort the event in such a way as to call up the Biblical burning bush. That, reinforced by the reference to the thunderstorm as "priest" (which adds an implication of sacrificial offering) trans- forms a physical fact entirely into a spiritual event, and we can see that our momentary aesthetic experience - the sight of the radi- ant lilac - really amounts to a chain of simultaneous associations passing through the aesthetic, moral, and religious categories of inner life to constitute another portrayal of life as a totality of human experiences throughout history, myth, and revelation. Such a simultaneous awareness of a mul- titude of things, fusing in the creative process into the recognition of a single all- pervading entity which is life, underlies the basic structure of most of Pasternak's poems. A particularly striking illustration of this can be seen in a poem devoted to Alexander Pushkin, where all manner of things from all over the globe blend into a single consciousness - that of Pushkin him- self at the moment of writing a poem called "The Prophet": Stars raced headlong. Seaward headlands lathered. Salt spray blinded. Eyes dried up their tears. Darkness filled the bedrooms. Thoughts raced headlong. To Sahara Sphinx turned patient ears. Candles guttered. Blood, it seemed, was frozen In the huge Colossus. Lips at play Swelled into the blue smile of the desert. In that hour of ebb night sank away. Seas were stirred by breezes from Morocco. Simoon blew. Archangel snored in snows. Candles guttered. First text of The Prophet Dried, and on the Ganges dawn arose. (Babette Deutsch, tr.) Thus poetic reality in the art of Pasternak is a blending of things, not possible in ordinary logic which depends upon defini- tions that separate one thing from another. Such reality is precisely the sum of apples and oranges, inconceivable to a mathema- tician, but perfectly familiar to a poet. It constitutes his whole inner world and it accustoms the poet to think of his own life, and that of others, not as a thing of itself, but as a common denominator uniting man and forest, man and grass, man and other men. Pasternak once praised Chekhov for "inscribing man in a landscape on equal</page><page sequence="3">SILBAJORIS 211 terms with birds and trees," in other words, for depicting the totality of life rather than an assemblage of solitudes circumscribed by separate individuals. It thus becomes possible for Pasternak to speak of human events as if they were events in all of nature, both animate and inanimate. He did so in Doctor Zhivago, describing the revolution simultaneously in terms of hu- man thought, feeling, and action, and in those of natural events: snows and storms, and insanely beautiful sultry summer nights when every man and every tree be- came transfigured into signs and wonders. Outside the framework of fiction, Paster- nak described his own upsurge of feeling which stimulated the writing of Sister My Life (see footnote on p. 195) and the excite- ment of the Russian people on the eve of the October Revolution in much the same way as in Doctor Zhivago : "The infectious universality of their exhilaration erased the borderline between man and nature. Dur- ing that remarkable summer of 1917, in between two revolutions, it seemed that roads, trees, and stars made speeches and held meetings together with the people. The air was permeated from end to end with an ardent thousand-mile-long inspira- tion and seemed to be a personality, to be clairvoyant, to have a soul." The concept of life as an all-pervading presence, as "the soul of air," is achieved in a moment of intense commitment to all of reality, when the heat of the poet's passion melts down the barriers between different categories of phenomena. In the poem "Vorob'ev Hills" we read: Rouse your soul to frenzy. Let today come foaming. It's the world's midday. Have you no eyes for it? Look how in the heights thoughts seethe into white bubbles Of fir-cones, woodpeckers, clouds, pine- needles, heat. (Babette Deutsch, tr.) The underlying faith which makes it possible for thoughts to "seethe" into fir- cones and clouds has been articulated by Pasternak in another poem, called "The Definition of Creativity": Gardens, ponds and palings, the creation Foam-flecked with the whiteness of our weeping Are nothing but categories of passion That the human heart has had in keeping. (C. M. Bowra, tr.) Thus life reveals itself to Pasternak in a world transformed by passion. Such a trans- formation also signals the birth of a poetic image, that is, the transition from an inert state of consciousness to the experience, and then also the language of art. And that is really the only thing that counts in the activity of an artist. A poem for Pasternak is never actually about the landscapes de- picted in it, or about love, or anything else except its own inception. Similarly, the essence of a novel does not lie in the events described, or the characters, or ideas, but in the presence of art. "The best creations in the world," said Pasternak on one occasion, "telling us of the most diverse things in reality describe their own birth." The birth of a work of art is essentially the creation of a central image-idea around which a system of specific metaphors can be devel- oped, that is, an angle of vision from which to convey the experience of reality per- ceived anew and in an unprecedented way. The ultimate frame of reference upon which the meaning of such a central image must rest is, in the work of Pasternak, his special conception of life. Thus, another way of saying that art describes its own birth is to say that it describes life itself. Pasternak put it as follows: "Besides and above the separate tropes and metaphorical turns of a poem there exists a figurative tendency, a drift in the poetry itself and in art as a whole - and that is its chief signifi- cance - to relate the general, summary pur- port of a composition to broader and more fundamental ideas - in order to reveal the sublimity of life and the unfathomable values of human existence." The values of a human existence can be- come unfathomable only when an individ-</page><page sequence="4">212 BOOKS ABROAD ual consciousness transcends itself in the recognition of life as a suprapersonal con- tinuum, when a person attempts to realize himself not in separation from but in a union with that eternal river of being. For Pasternak this necessitates a manner of writing in which a personal awareness of life, at its most intense, embodies itself not in images centering around an individual ego, but, on the contrary, in those that dis- solve the ego into the fabric of reality of which it then becomes an indistinguishable part. This sets Pasternak off from those artists who experience inspiration as a heightening of their own power, placing them in a dominant position in their own work. Art for them is essentially self-ful- fillment. For Pasternak, however, art en- tails the displacement of consciousness from oneself to the surrounding reality as trans- figured by the imagination. In his poetry we may find various ap- proaches toward constructing poetic images so as to achieve the dissolution of the per- sonal "I" in the texture of the poem. Some times, although he speaks of himself in the first person, it is done not to separate the ego from the context in which he stands, but to set up the dynamics of a poem in such a way that the poem shall achieve artistic fulfillment when the ego and its surroundings blend into a new entity. In an early poem the fusion of the two is directly proclaimed as if it were an article of faith: "And I transfer over into this night/As if into an unheard-of faith." The expression "unheard-of" separates this ex- perience from such familiar notions as pantheism, or the romantic urge to com- municate with nature by ascribing to it anthropomorphic qualities. Pasternak un- derstands that nature, with all its wondrous complexities, is not commensurate with the concept of God, and he also knows that pretended communication with objects in nature on human terms can at best con- stitute a basis for imagery, but not for be- lief. His own faith is that man is an "articulate configuration" upon the surface of life in its totality as, perhaps, an expres- sion of the will of God. At other times, as in Zhivago's poem "August," the blending with nature de- velops gradually, in connection with the theme of death. The poem fulfills itself when the imagined death and eventual decomposition in the soil of the individual "I" becomes equivalent to immortality: Death stood like a state surveyor Within God's acre in this forest, scanning My lifeless face, as if it thought How best to dig my grave to proper measure. All of you heard (not inwardly but with your sense of hearing) The calm voice of someone close beside you. That voice had been mine once, a fatidic voice. It sounded now, untouched by death's corruption. (Manya Harari, tr.) As a matter of fact, this is precisely how Zhivago's own immortality embodies itself after his death in the flowers around him, in his poems, and in his thoughts which are forever creating the future. A different method of integrating the persona of a poem with its surroundings is the depiction of it as a presence which passes through reality, as if the world were, in Pasternak's own words, "a transparent fabric of being." One might say that there are distances between one dead fact and another which can be filled with the poet's own essence, his creative power, to achieve a transformed reality, a blend of mind and object which, again, amounts to a descrip- tion of life. In a poem from "The Second Coming" Pasternak writes : Across the thin-ribbed expanse of fences I shall pass through as does the light, Or else, as image enter image, And as one object cuts another. To pass through reality in the manner of a ray of light is to illuminate it from within, and that, for Pasternak, describes the action of art. In Safe Conduct he speaks of it as</page><page sequence="5">SILBAJORIS 213 follows: "I would point out that, as distinct from science which takes nature in a dis- section of the pillar of light, art concerns itself with life as the ray of power passes through it" Finally, one could mention the matter of perspective. Quite often Pasternak describes events from nature's own point of view, and not from that of the artist, thus subor- dinating the author, in his own poem, to a sequence of phenomena of which he is not the center. Or else an event in nature is not what the artist sees, but what it does itself, as in this description of dawn in the Urals: Without a midwife, in darkness, dazed, Hands braced against the night, the mass Of the Urals roared and, falling unconscious Gave birth to the morning. This manner of creating poetic imagery implies a very special conception of the nature and place of the individual con- sciousness in the general scheme of things. In Pasternak's view, the deliberate choice of such images and perspectives, which seem to eliminate the presence of the artist, imi- tates the processes of adaptation and cam- ouflage taking place in nature itself. A transparent jellyfish, for instance, may be- come practically invisible against the sandy bottom of the sea, and yet, our knowledge that it is there, makes any given spot on the seashore, so to speak, potentially a jellyfish. Thus an organism survives by seeming both to disappear and to augment itself to include all surrounding reality. The moment in evolution when a living crea- ture deliberately attempts to resemble its surroundings is, for Pasternak, also the moment that signals the emergence of con- sciousness, because it manifests an aware- ness of the difference between "I" and "not-I." Therefore an artist also, reaching the highest degree of consciousness, imitates in the spiritual dimension the action of a butterfly when it merges with the mottled surface of a stone, at the time when he creates a poem which seems, somehow, to both conceal and augment the artist in the reality depicted by him. The poet makes a conscious effort to become identical with the totality of life, and in so doing under- stands for the first time what life actually is. An artist's self-awareness, therefore, is not a cogito ergo sum in opposition to the rest of reality, but a continuation and per- fection of the existence of all things. In this sense, an individual becomes really but an embodiment of the all-pervad- ing life force which is itself immortal. In Pasternak's work, immortality is not the continued existence of a separate ego in a metaphysical dimension, but an unbroken chain of being, encompassing both man and nature. He once expressed this idea in a poem called "In the Hospital," where a dying man sees "a part of a garden and a piece of sky" framed by the window, and understands that his own being, like the sky and the garden, continues beyond that frame, that is, beyond the frame of himself as a separate individual. In a wartime poem, "Death of a Pioneer," Pasternak describes the fatal wounding of a soldier engaged in cutting a path through barbed wire for the attacking Russian troops. As the soldier's life ebbs away from him, it seems to re-embody itself in the whole attacking army which breaks through the opening he has made, as if his own personal existence had broken out of his body to become a thunderous, fiery mass of Rus- sians, crashing on to victory like sea waves across a broken dike. The soldier is dead, but the energy and devotion of his deed continue to live in all others, thus making him immortal - an immortality, one might add, quite unlike that of a stone memorial. Similar ideas are expressed in Doctor Zhi- vago, especially in the passage where the young doctor, trying to calm the fears of his mother-in-law who is on the threshold of death, explains that an individual's con- sciousness is a light turned not inward, to form a single hermetical existence, but out- ward, to illuminate the totality of life. This is why, says Zhivago, "man in other people is the soul of man." In Safe Conduct, Pas-</page><page sequence="6">214 BOOKS ABROAD ternak notes, apropos of reading Rilke, that the true biography of a poet is what hap- pens to the minds of his readers, and in Autobiographical S\etch he speaks of the artist's joy of life which continues to exist after his own death to be shared by every- one in all the coming generations. In this way, life, a generalized abstract concept, becomes an entity concretely shared with all others. Such an understand- ing of it naturally points to the establish- ment of a moral quality of life defined as a gift and as sacrifice. The lines from Zhi- vago's poem "The Wedding": Life is also just a moment, Just a dissolution Of ourselves in all the others, As if bestowing a gift. (Many a Harari, tr.) are answered by multiple echoes in the whole work of Pasternak, constituting one of his central ideas. But since death is not annihilation, but only a perfect gift of one- self, then the very principle of sacrifice is connected not with suffering and self-re- fusal, but with joy and self -fulfillment. This glad knowledge that life is a sacrifice grows steadily in Pasternak's poetry and becomes especially important in the poems of Doctor Zhivago. In the early verse, the impulse of self -dissolution did not necessarily bear the name of sacrifice, but it was already an act of poetic faith. Later, in such long poems as "The Year 1905" and "Lieutenant Schmidt," this faith acquired the quality of a social act, a commitment of one's life to his fellow men at the time of great histori- cal upheavals. Finally, in Doctor Zhivago, the notion of sacrifice expresses itself in specific religious terms. While in the novel proper, sacrifice might still be essentially a social-historical act (Zhivago and Lara give up their active role in the events of the Revolution in order to remain the guard- ians and witnesses of its spirit), in Zhi- vago's poems that spirit of the Revolution comes to resemble the spirit of sacrifice as it was embodied once before, in the death of Christ. Thus, in the work of Pasternak the con- sciousness of a single individual is a fact pertaining to the entire universe, because the image of man in art relates to and encompasses all aspects of being. Life is conceived as a force which fulfills itself equally in a poetic image, in the encounter between a single individual and the flow of history, and in the leaves of grass where, Pasternak once said, we shall find poetry if we bend down low enough to hear it. In the context of world literature, the figure of Pasternak stands out sharply against the studies in solitude and despair which represent the posture of so much of modern art. His world-embracing opti- mism seems naive, though touching, when compared with the clear and merciless knowledge of a Samuel Beckett that, what- ever images of immortal life force we might construct, the death of each one of us is absolutely certain, and it entails the total annihilation of these our images, and our faith, and, in a very personal but none- theless total sense, of the entire universe. If life is to be a continuum, then it is a circu- lar one, turning endlessly inside the prison of an individual consciousness until the lights go out. The crucial question is: what is the knowledge of Pasternak worth as against that of Beckett ? The answer, if we could find one, would not necessarily affect Pas- ternak's excellence as an artist, but it might well destroy the mean- ing of life as he under- stood it.
