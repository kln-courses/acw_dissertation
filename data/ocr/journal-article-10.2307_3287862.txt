<plain_text><page sequence="1">]Uo of rbirm Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion. By ARTHUR BERNARD COOK. I. Zeus, God of the Bright Sky. Cambridge University Press, 1914. Pp. xliii+885. ?2 5s. The present volume, despite its great bulk, is only the first half of the author's work on Zeus. Furthermore, several appendixes dealing with topics belonging to this volume have been relegated to the end of the second. Chap. i of the work, "Zeus as god of the Bright Sky," occupies the whole of this volume. In nine subdivisions the author discusses "Zeus and the Daylight"; " Zeus and the Burning Sky " (aither); "Zeus Lykaios"; "Zeus and Olympus"; "The Mountain-Cults of Zeus"; "Zeus in Relation to the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars"; and gives a few pages of general conclusions with regard to "Zeus as god of the Bright Sky." Two indexes, one of persons, places, and festivals, the other of subjects and authorities, are of unusual fulness (99 pages), and have satisfied several tests for accuracy. The illustrations are an extremely valuable feature of the work; there are more than 6oo, not a few from hitherto unpublished objects, and 42 of the number are plates. All are beautifully executed. In the field of numismatics in particular the author's special knowledge and personal collections have stood him in good stead. The general conclusions reached by Mr. Cook are best stated in his own words (pp. 776 ff.): "Zeus, whose name means 'the Bright One,' was originally conceived in zoistic fashion as the bright sky itself. .... The change from the zoistic to the anthropomorphic Zeus was occasioned, not by any despair of magic, but rather by a naive attempt to express heaven in terms of earth. The divine sky, as supreme weather-maker, was represented under the guise of an ordinary human magician, or weather-ruling king. This transition, which had been accomplished well before the end of the second millennium B.C., meant that Zeus was no longer worshipped as the sky but as the sky-god. .... As god of the bright or burning sky, Zeus dwelt in aither. .... And since high moun- tains were supposed . ... to penetrate the upper zone of aither, mountain- tops were regarded as in a peculiar sense the abode of Zeus. .... To the mind of the Greek, sun, moon, and stars were made of the same fiery stuff as the aither itself. Zeus, therefore, must needs stand in relations of peculiar intimacy toward these special exhibitions of his own brightnesss. .... In various districts of the Mediterranean area the sun was popularly viewed as an eye, a wheel, a bird, a ram, a bull, a bronze man. .... But each of these manifold and in part barbaric notions was sooner or later absorbed into I55</page><page sequence="2">156 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL the all-comprehensive cult of the Greek sky-god ..... In short, Zeus was brought into close connection with any and every celestial luminary. But * . . . it must be steadily borne in mind that genuine Hellenic religion never identified Zeus with sun or moon or star." The author further summarizes the syncretistic development of Zeus-cults, which subject occupies no small part of the volume, and lays emphasis in closing upon the importance of Zeus's character as a father, a procreative god. To the elaboration of these views the author has devoted himself with extraordinary industry and a remarkable display of varied and minute learn- ing. He has collected the ancient material, literary and archaeological, with great care, and shows an unusual command of previous writings in all parts of his field. With the main outlines of Mr. Cook's work many critics will find little difficulty in agreeing, though many will certainly balk at the attempt to interpret in terms of solar symbolism the various animal aspects of Zeus. Are not the animals important enough in the life of early man to become sacred and so develop divine relationships without the need of a celestial intermediary? No doubt the sociological or anthropological method of inquiry has its dangers, but more attention to the phenomena of early societies would save investigators from many vagaries of the naturalistic theory. The greatest fault in Mr. Cook's general point of view is his tendency to consider Zeus in nature rather than in human society. In matters of detail the conservative reader of this work will find himself very frequently dissenting. With the highest regard for the author's erudition and a cordial desire to be instructed the reviewer finds himself utterly unable to see the cogency of many arguments and the value of many combinations here presented. It is impossible adequately to illustrate these objections in the space here available, and the selection of a few items is sure to seem captious. However, it is hard to be patient with such combinations as that of Circe, hawk, and sun-wheel (p. 243), of moon and mulberry tree (p. 470), with the sug- gestion about the willow (p. 549), and the interpretation of the brawl between Dikaiopolis and the chorus (p. 689). Mr. Cook's too-pronounced tendency to grasp at mere shreds of evidence is shown by the note on Triptolemos at Gaza (p. 237, n. 4), the conjecture about Talos, Kalos, and the rope (pp. 725 f.), and the use made of a certain bit of prehistoric art (p. 501, Fig. 363). Some of these doubtful speculations may conceivably prove fruitful later if the author's further researches bring confirmatory material; but surely it would have been better for the present to hold them in petto and disburden a book already too heavy with details and conjectures. In spite of these faults Mr. Cook deserves the highest praise for the sin- cerity that he manifests throughout in his handling of his sources. Here is no juggling of evidence. The reader has the material before him and may accept or reject the author's interpretation. He may be dissatisfied with it; he need not be misled. The severest penalty which, because of its bulk and its con- jectural character, can justly befall so honest a work is that it may be used less</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 157 for its main thesis than for its wonderful collection of material and for its by- products, such as the discussions of the iynx (pp. 253-65), the Labyrinth (p. 472), Minoan bullfights (p. 497), the origins of the drama (pp. 665 ff.), the Dioscuri (pp. 76o ff.). And it may be doubted whether a scholar of so gener- ous and unselfish a spirit as Mr. Cook's would resent this verdict. Among the very few available authorities that Mr. Cook has not used may be mentioned Pley's De lanae in antiquorum ritibus usu (Giessen, I9II), for the A~uh K)&amp;Aov (p. 422), and Elworthy's Horns of Honour (in connection with pp. 5o6 ff.).
