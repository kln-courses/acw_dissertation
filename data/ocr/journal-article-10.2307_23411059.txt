<plain_text><page sequence="1">All things bright and beautiful, or all things wise and wonderful? Objects from Island Oceania in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery When Philip Dark asked me to write a piece about the Pacific material in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG), I had difficulty deciding what sort of approach to take. First, I had to accept that, like most of us, my knowledge of Pacific art is stronger in certain areas than others, and 1 have to rely heavily on the literature in areas I know less about. Second, the TMAG has approximately io,ooo objects catalogued in its ethnographic col lection, the majority of them from Australia and Island Oceania. Simply listing the objects is a huge task way beyond the scope of an article such as this,1 and at the end of the day it would be meaningless to readers except statistically, unless extensively annotated. A short selected listing was obviously not only all I could do, but could be more informative. The selection of some objects for photographic inclusion highlighted the next dilemma. Should I try to illustrate only what a western readership would consider the more dazzling objects? There are certainly some exceptionally fine and rare pieces in the collection. But the great treasure-houses of the world, whose financial capacity to collect aggres sively over a long period puts them in a totally dif ferent league from the TMAG, would in most cases have items equal or superior, which have been illus trated previously. Against this, however, the TMAG does have an unusually rich array of everyday items from a number of societies, which tell a different and sometimes more intimate and engaging story. For obvious enough reasons, the large coffee table books that result from the interest of people such as all of us in the PAA, tend to focus on arti facts which are considered to be self-evidently 'trea sures,' and unquestionably the objects that adorn their pages are marvels of human creativity. Also Roderick Ewins Retired Head of Fine Arts, University of Tasmania at Hobart many, indeed most, are ritual objects and thus essen tial to the spiritual life of their makers and owners. But it is not always safe to assume that only the more dazzling objects fulfill that role. Apparently humble objects might possess great and lasting importance. For example, plain white bark-cloth was not often collected in Fiji, yet white signified the spiritual domain, and white cloth was reserved for the prin cipal rites of passage and for special uses in the tern pies. Arguably it was of at least as deep cultural sig nificance as the richly-figured cloth normally collected.2 But finally and most importantly, it is the spread of objects that provides true insights into societies, and surely that is of far greater importance than merely bringing a caressing western gaze to isolated and decontextualized artworks. As a held anthro pologist I am usually left feeling restless after poring over such picture books, and often also after visiting the public display areas of museums. It is not until I go into museum storerooms that the societies start to come to life through the entirety of the objects that clutter the shelves, each demanding its rightful role, however restricted, in the telling of the stories of its makers and users.^ Social anthropologists have for a long time been dismissive of such objects,4 and in museums they are usually at the end of the queue for curatorial attention, and are frequently in a woe ful state. But were they really, to the societies that made and used them, less important? Such societies tend to be less prone than ours to value what we define as art' more highly than what we often define as craft,' or even more pejoratively, 'handicraft.' For similar reasons of Western taste and precon ception, it has also generally been the 'dazzling' items, not the more humble ones, that have been July 1997 71</page><page sequence="2">subject to mass-production for the tourist market — as Meyer (1995:7) points out, Maori greenstone heitiki were apparently being produced in numbers for trade to western visitors by the time of Cook's second voyage, Easter Island 'sacred' figures that never saw service were being churned out by the early 1800s, large ceremonial' paddles were being mass-produced in Ra'ivavae by the 1820s, as were large pedestal-adzes in Mangaia. Today, he points out, 'Asmat' shields are even being carved in Bali! If Museums are concerned about authenticity' (by whatever definition — the debate goes on), and provenances are shaky (as they more often are than aren't), it is far more likely to reside securely in a bilum string bag or digging stick than in a Sepik mask. sage motivated creativity and aesthetic judgement. The daily business of living was celebrated by the application of artistry to the 'everyday' treasured objects, and frequently the constraints of tradition surrounding such objects were less rigid, resulting in the exercise of great originality. Over the past two decades I have worked in the storerooms of dozens of museums large and small all over Australia and New Zealand, through much of the USA, Great Britain and Ireland, and Western Europe. My purpose has been to survey, and fre quently to identify unattributed or misattributed, Fijian items among collections of material from all over the Pacific — and frequently further afield. In the course of this I have of course encountered great masterpieces also, superb and unforgettable exam ples of artistic expression. But along with those, why is it that many of the things that haunt the mind are not dazzling, are not tours deforce of the carver's, pot ter's, weaver's or painter's arts, but are humble (if often elegant) items? Among once-common but now very rare Fijian objects I recall such things as: a turtle-scapula breadfruit-splitter in Berne; a group of finely-woven flat satchels (in which women kept their husbands' hair-scarfs) in the British Museum; a cone-shaped fiber kava-strainer in Newcastle; a janus-headed walking staff in Frankfurt; a pinafore style dress (sewn in Fiji by a chiefly woman using kin-derived Futuna barkcloth) in Brighton Pavilion; a very rare collection of male-decorated Highland barkcloth in the New York Museum of Natural History; a ceramic canoe-hearth in Peabody Cambridge. The list goes on and on, and could be repeated for virtually every society whose material culture has been collected and squirrelled away in large and small museums all around the world. The picture that emerges is of societies in which not only cere mony, religious awe, and momentous stages of pas In the end, in my choice of items to photograph for this article I have tried to balance the quality and age of the item, and gender of maker/user, with rel ative unconimonness in books. Coupled with con straints on the number of photographs I could use, the equation was impossible, but I trust will give some sense of what I have been discussing above. The collectors are the other intriguing part of the equation. Like most smaller museums, the TMAG has had limited funds for purchase, and for the same reason was never able to mount the collecting expe ditions engaged in by some of the great museums. The nature of smaller collections, therefore, is large ly determined accidents of history—who was where and when, and which of them made gifts and left bequests to the museum. What is remarkable, given this, is that so many small museums in far-flung cor ners have ended up with what are significant and fas cinating collections of material from often unlikely places. Few museums, large or small, have any shortage of weapons (not only Oceanic collections, either). On an artifact count alone, it would seem reason able to assume that murder and mayhem was the principal preoccupation of most cultures through out history. Pacific cultures among them. In the TMAG nearly half of the ethnographic collection is weapons. The reason, I suggest, was less the unques tioned fact that warfare was a significant cultural phenomenon in such societies, for after all they still needed a diversity of objects to get on with all of the other aspects of living. It was more that the 19th century male collectors had much less interest in defining the cultures they had contact with, than in the construction of their own identities.5 The 'war rior was associated with manliness, and to display on one's wall a collection of weapons from 'the islands' was to portray oneself as a man among men, and sufficiently powerful to obtain the weapons of the 'Other.' The mythology is very powerful. Similarly, for a male missionary to acquire the symbolic objects of'primitive' religion was testimo ny to their success in dislodging false gods — their 72 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="3">version of manly power. I have in a number of per sonal journals encountered comments by mission aries about their obtaining idols and other items from 'heathen priests' on the basis that the latter would have no further need of these, and were either pressured into giving them to those who had sup planted them, or gave them voluntarily as evidence of the sincerity of their conversion. The female domain, unsurprisingly, tended to be less well represented in such collections. This is shown dramatically by the fact that, while it is my impression that relative to some collections the TMAG is quite strong in the female domains, par ticularly of weaving and textiles (skirts, mats, fans, dilly-bags, baskets, feather-work, loom-weaving and bark cloth),'' nonetheless, relative to female pro ductivity as against male productivity in Oceania, it is very small, all female productions representing only a little over 10% of the holdings (compared, as mentioned, with 40% for weapons alone). Of course, women would have had a hand in the pro duction of a number of other articles not specifical ly in the female domain (such as barkcloth-covered ceremonial masks), but the fact remains that there was a colossal gendered selectivity of both vision and collection.7 The Melanesian bias of the collection, and the fact that in Melanesia material culture pro duction was more extensively a male domain (com pared with Micronesia and Polynesia), in particular of the ceremonial items that have been privileged in collecting, are still inadequate reasons. Women still produced a significant range of goods, including some directly related to their own rich ceremonial life. The reason was, I contend, at least in part the same as the reason for a focus on weapons. The 'fron tier' tended to be (at least conceptually) a male domain, and there was no wish on the male collec tor's part to define his identity in terms of female articles. Where these do appear, they tend to be either ceremonial objects that were presented to the collector (such as bark-cloth), or usable articles (such as some baskets and floor-mats). The excep tion to this was when women accompanied the men, and often acquired domestic articles chosen for their beauty, delicacy, or practical ingenuity. It might be argued that these were also associated, if not with identity construction, at least with a perception of self on the part of the Western women whose iden tity was itself at that time constrained and defined in largely male-sanctioned terms. Finally, however, there were instances where the contact was sufficiently long and/or intimate, and the collectors of either sex sufficiently generous-spir ited, that they did become genuinely interested in the people with whom they shared their lives, and sought to remember them as more than symbols of their own conquest or achievement. It is to these people, largely, that we owe a debt for the collections of digging-sticks, tapa-beaters, water-containers, sago-pounders, collecting-baskets, dilly-bags and other articles, sometimes, as I have suggested in the title of this paper, bright and beautiful, but usually wise and wonderful. I will try, in this brief overview, to offer some balance between the two. The Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery Along with Glasgow and Edinburgh and a number of other surviving Museum and Art Gallery com plexes throughout the British Empire, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery and its sister institution in Tasmania's other large center, Launceston (The Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery — QVMAG), were if not a direct product of the 1851 Great Exhibition of London at the Crystal Palace, at least a product of the same eclectic spirit and desire to display the finest achievements of the arts and sciences within one complex. It was a lofty goal, and the imposing edifices both cities erected demonstrated both their earnest intent and their unshakable faith in the future of their small com munities. With its establishment by Act of Parliament in 1885, the TMAG inherited the 1863 museum build ing and the collections of the Royal Society of Tasmania for Horticulture, Botany and the Advancement of Science, whose members had an interest in all parts of the natural world from min erals, flora, and fauna to 'primitive' man. Their col lections formed the basis of several of the new Museum's domains of specialization, including the ethnographic. While the bulk ot the ethnographic collection dates from 1863 onward, objects were being assembled from the founding of the Society in 1843,^ and many would have been collected at some earlier date. As a result, a number of Pacific objects in the collection would have a collection date of a century-and-a-half ago. Really very few are of July 1997 73</page><page sequence="4">recent manufacture, with the exception of some aboriginal material that is still being actively col lected by the Museum. Tourist objects do pop up as they do in all collections, but they are few. The live ly current anthropological debates about authentic ity are therefore hardly relevant, and certainly do not need to be explored here. Overwhelmingly, the TMAG's Pacific ethnographic material came out of societies in which the syncretic process of incorpo rating Western culture was not yet far advanced, so their cultural messages are sharper, less layered. There were two important factors that influenced the large number and high quality of objects which came into the TMAG during the 19th century and early 20th century. First was the fact that Hobart was an important deep-water transit port through out that period (as it remains, though today less fre quented), with many sailors and naval officers visit ing and not a few returning to retire here. In these categories belong the 25 naval captains and lieu tenants whose names are associated with some 200 objects, some of them striking and important. While their gifts were, as might be expected, prin cipally of weapons (and a number of skirts — they were sailors!), some (notably Lt. E.E. Jones and Lt.C.R.Watson) were discerning collectors, whose travels included inland areas as well as ports. A sur vey of their gifts helps explain the richness of the col lections of Melanesian material in particular. 9 Second was the fact that it was an important mis sionary base first for the Wesleyan Mission to the Western Pacific and then for both Presbyterians and Anglicans, who staged in Hobart enroute from Britain to their postings in the islands, used it for 'R &amp; R' and, in some cases, based families here and/or retired here. Many missionaries were avid personal collectors of indigenous artifacts of all sorts, and they also sent 'home' artifacts to be sold as a means of raising funds for their missions. As a result, many of the items in the collection can be traced either directly to these discerning collectors, or to their agency — indeed, it is striking that the strengths of the ethnographic collections coincide remarkably with the presence of Hobart-associated missionaries. Of particular importance as collectors were the following: Brown, George. [Samoa 1860-74, New Britain/New Ireland 1875-?] (nearly 70 items). Chalmers, James 1841-1901 [Rarotonga 1867-77, south and southeast PNG 1877-1901] and author of several books including Pioneer life and work in New Guinea 1877-94. (nearly 70 items). Frazer, Robert M.1851-1921 [Epi, Vanuatu 1882-1921; wife Elizabeth Westbrook from Hobart, daughter Ruth worked in Epi with him and returned to Hobart on his death] (over 30 items). Moore, William [Fiji 1850-69, based in Hobart, wife and 16 children there] Waterhouse, John d.1842 [first regional General Superintendent of Wesleyan Mission, based in Hobart. Visited Fiji 1840, 1841 and brought artifacts to Hobart] Waterhouse, Joseph 1828-81 [Fiji 1850-78; son of John, based in Hobart, wife and ten chil dren survived him there] There were also several prominent and discrimi nating Tasmanian collectors of Pacificana, with items from all regions occurring in the Museum's holdings as a result of posthumous purchases or bequests. Most notable among these are: Beattie, John W.1859-1930 [Professional pho tographer and keen amateur anthropologist, toured the Western Pacific in 1906. Much of his collection was purchased by the QVMAG in Launceston before his death, but some came to the TMAG posthumously]. Sticht, Robert C. 1856—1922 [Mining engineer and 'gentleman collector' of a great array of categories from mediaeval parchments to ethnographic material which he documented in an Edge-Partington manner. His collections were broken up, some Pacific material coming to the TMAG from his estate in 1963]. Taylor, Alfred J. 1849-1921 [Librarian of the Tasmanian Public Library for 47 years, trav elled in 1905, probably collecting. He ran a private museum of Natural History ('Henry's Museum'), part or all of which was purchased by the TMAG in 1922, the year after his death]. One other source of note should be mentioned: the retiring Lieutenant-Governor of British New Guinea, Sir George Le Hunte, who in 1906 gave the 74 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="5">Museum about 50 items from his administrative area.10 ment, particularly shell-work necklaces. There are a great number of stone implements, again from all over Australia but of course with many archaeolith ic flaked implements from Tasmania. There is also a significant collection of current contemporary abo riginal art from various parts of Australia, in partic ular of course Tasmania, which is being actively col lected and documented by the Museum. The extensiveness of the holdings and my own inade quate knowledge of Aboriginal ethnography prompt me to leave this material for a separate review at another time.11 The Collection Australia Perhaps not surprisingly, there is considerable Australian Aboriginal material (over 2,000 articles). The objects come from a very wide spread of loca tions. The largest number are from Tasmania, then in descending order Queensland, Western Australia, Victoria, Torres Strait Islands, Northern Territory, New South Wales and South Australia. As usual, there are many weapons: a very large number of spears, fighting clubs and boomerangs from all over Australia. Of note are numerous decorated shields, and an intact full-sized bark canoe from Victoria is unusual. Among women's objects, there is a large amount of woven material, some beautifully formed baskets and dilly-bags, and a lot of personal adorn Figure I. Tatanua malagan mask M135, New Ireland Melanesia By far the largest ethnographic collection overall is of Melanesian material. PNG There are over 2,000 objects from Papua New Guinea (including the offshore islands of the Trobriand Is, Admiralty Is, New Ireland, New Britain and Bougainville), with some particularly interesting material coming via Rev. Brown in New Britain and New Ireland, and Rev. Chalmers and Sir George Le Hunte in the former British New Guinea (later Papua). As a result, Massim District/ Trobriand Islands, New Britain &amp; New Ireland, and the Fly River are the best-represented areas of Papua New Guinea, though there is also important mate rial from the Papuan Gulf, and from Collingwood Bay. A reasonable amount of this material is prove nanced, due largely to the knowledge of the naval and missionary donors. Admiralty Is, New Britain &amp; New Ireland There is not a great deal of malagan (or malanggan) mortuary material, but what there is, is both old and in excellent condition.12 • Tatanua mortuary malagan (malanggan) "soul" mask from New Ireland (Fig. i) The apparent helmet crest connotes a former style of hairdress which was worn as a sign of mourning (c.f. Nevermann 1979:476—7; cf. also Brake et al 1979: 52-3; Joyce 1925:38; Meyer 1995:342,346) • A kulap funerary figure, female, 1869 Rev. G. Brown. (Fig. 2) These figures were carved from chalk found in central New Ireland, and were tem porary repositories for the spirit of the deceased. After the funeral ceremonies the figures were broken July 1997 75</page><page sequence="6">Figure 2. Kulap funerary figure M4544, New Ireland to release the spirit, which may explain why this fig ure has one leg broken off (c.f. Meyer 1995: 353; Brake et al 1979: 46,48). • Mask in typical open-carving form and red and-white paint used for tall malagan objects There is a great deal of shell wealth in various forms:1^ • 7 strings of money from New Britain., 6 with extremely early acquisition numbers • A number of personal adornments in the form of tiny shell-discs forming gorgets, armlets etc. • Man's dance-apron from the Admiralty Is, donated in 1920 (Fig. 3). The following items are also noteworthy:1^ • A bag with rattles of large hollow seeds and shells, probably shaman's, from New Britain. • A small, brightly painted 'fish-head' with a han dle and catseye' shell opercula as eyes. Probably a shaman's charm. Collected by Rev.George Brown, therefore before 1908. • 2 canoe-prow ornaments from New Ireland. Massim/Trobriand Is. This collection is limited in scope but notable in three categories of item: • Immediately obvious is the remarkable num ber of ceremonial clubs or maces (pulata) — nearly 80 of them, many dated to the 19th century, and diverse in form, ranging from spatulate to cutlass shaped. The handle of some ends in the curious form reminiscent of a Spanish helmet, also found on a particular type of Fijian club (lost caravel?). *5 Pulata are familiar in the literature (e.g. Rogers 1970: ioi, Meyer 1995:149; Greub 1988:167). • Another important collection is of over 40 fine ly carved lime spatulae (Fig. 4) (the lime taken in conjunction with betel and areca-nut when chew ing), many with anthropomorphic spirit forms on the handles, imparting malevolent magical powers to the spatulae (c.f. Sotheby 1992: 128-9; Meyer 1995: 137, 140-1). Many have early donor informa tion — half of them came from the Lt.Gov. of British New Guinea in 1906. There are only a cou ple of the associated lime-gourds in the collection — they are less spectacular and lack magical prop Figure 3.

Handles of lime spatulae M237/8/9 Trobriand Is., Massim, PNG — they are less spectacular and lack magical prop erties, so were not so sought-after. • There are four fine painted wooden shields, also familiar in the literature though rare, almost cer tainly the possessions of the powerful and important (c.f. Joyce 1925: 133; Biihler et al 1962: 101; Rogers 1970:101; Meyer 1995:148).16 • Two carved wooden pigs with surface decora tion, one large, one small (c.f. Brake et al 1979: 90; Sotheby 1992: 144) • 17 carved paddles, 13 from C19 collectors (c.f. Meyer 1995: 145); 2 canoe prow boards (c.f. Meyer 1995: 142); 5 wooden bowls (3 of bowls, and canoe prows also from the Lt.Gov. 1906)1? • Two sleeping mats c.1900; a cowrie-decorated armlet; numerous axes and adzes.^ Southern PNG, Papuan Gulf and Elema District There is an assortment of objects catalogued rather vaguely 'Southern PNG,' which contains objects from the Papuan Gulf (including the Elema people of the eastern Papuan Gulf) but includes some objects from the southeastern extremity of PNG south of the Markham River. I have grouped them here. The most important objects in the group are from the Elema, doubly important since Elema art has declined following the 1919 'Vailala Madness' of cargo-cultists, and 1930s Christian converts, who between them destroyed much of the old art. Notable are::9 • Kovave spirit-mask, a typical tall conical mask of bark-cloth over a frame, painted and bearing a 'beak' with many fine teeth (Fig. 5). Bark-cloth over cane frame. Kovave are forest spirits summoned during male initiation ceremonies, when the initi ates wear these masks (cf. Joyce 1925: 134; Meyer 1995: 126-8). Figure 5. Kovave spirit-mask M1764. Elema people, E. Papuan Gulf July 1997 77</page><page sequence="8">• A collection of nine marupai magic good luck charms, several in their woven bags, some without. (Fig. 6) Carved from dwarf coconut, in the form of a pig-like head, these were a bringer of good fortune in pigs and crops.The majority were purchased at auction in 1891. (cf. Rogers 1970: 65; Sotheby's Peter Hallinan Collection 1992:150; Meyer 1995:131). • Two unusual caps composed entirely of sewn together shells, from 'Southern P.N.G'. They were obtained from the Australian Board of Missions, and are labeled 'Widows Weeds.' Special widows' caps are not uncommon in a number of societies (Fig 7)-2° • Utilitarian items including 9 pig-catching nets and 8 digging sticks • Clothing and items of personal adornment including skirts, armlets, ear ornaments and head dresses. Huon Gulp2 The Huon Gulf is part of the Vitiaz Straits Trade System (for description and similar examples see Rogers 1970; 1 y6ff and Meyer 1995:159, 163), from which there are various articles in the collection. The area is famous for its carving of which there are three examples held: • 2 typical wooden bowls, both collected pre-1920 (Taylor and Lt.Jones). One was obtained from Morobe/Kilenge, though both were very probably carved in the Tami Islands, a long way from where it was obtained (cf. Rogers 1970; 201 and Meyer 1995:163). • A wooden headrest, with a janus-headed figure that has the flexed knees typical of figures from this area, finely carved and accented with lime (Fig. 8). Also probably carved in the Tami Islands (cf.Meyer 1995:162). Fly River This collection of nearly 90 items owes its presence largely to Rev. James Chalmers, who was active in this area from the late 1870s until 1901, and was an avid collector. Notable are:21 • 2 gope ancestor boards • A dance helmet • 4 ceremonial axes • A collection of musical instruments: 2 drums, 5 'Jews harps,' 2 shell trumpets, 2 rattles • A headrest Figure 6.

Southern PNG Collingwood Bay Most significant for this area is: • A collection of 24 bark-cloths of apparent age obtained from the Australian Board of Missions in 1983 (though no collection dates are recorded), addi tional to one early piece (Lt.Gov of British NG, pre 1906) and one unprovenanced.2^ These decorated bark-cloths, made by the women, are the produc tion for which Collingwood Bay is most known. • A collection of 24 bark-cloths of apparent age obtained from the Australian Board of Missions in 1983 (though no collection dates are recorded), addi tional to one early piece (Lt.Gov of Brit - over 2 dozen clubs dated between 1891 and 1918. • A model canoe24 Bougainville As anyone following the disputes over copper min ing must be well aware, Bougainville is both geo graphically and culturally far closer to the Solomon Is. than it is to PNG, to which it is attached admin istratively. Most old catalogue listings record it as 'Bougainville, Solomon Is.' There is not a great deal of material of interest other than weapons. Figure 8.

Surprising, even though one knows that this was a warlike society, a massive 80% of the collection is composed of bows, arrows and spears, many of them finely made. • 14 paddles, 12 of them obtained from the Australian Museum in 1892 (cf. Meyer 1995: 396—7), along with 3 ceremonial wands given together with 24 other' Solomon Is wands.25 • 9 baskets, 2 of them donated in 1899, the rest unprovenanced, and 1 string bag.2'' Other PNG Among the many items unspecified as to district are a number of beautifully woven bilum, or string bags, usually with dyed weave forming geometric designs (Fig. 9) (for current discussions of these important objects see MacKenzie 1991 and Hauser-Schaublin 1996). There are also some finely carved mens' bark belts. Of grisly interest are three 'man-catchers' (prob ably Abelam) used by head-hunters in raids to secure heads for their haus tamberan. These are simple cane objects with a long handle ending in a large loop, with a sharp spike projecting from the handle into the loop — the practice being to 'lasso' the fleeing victim and impale them simultaneously without damaging the skull, a scene illustrated in Chalmers (1895) and reproduced in Rogers (1970:182). Indeed Chalmers very possibly collected these examples, though no source is listed. Solomon Is/Santa Cruz The Solomon and Santa Cruz Islands (geographi cally close but culturally distinct) appear on the reg ister to be extremely well represented, but over a third of the holdings are arrows, and the total weapon count is over half of the over 600 items! What remains, however, is a rich collection of every day items from digging sticks to canoe bailers to water containers, many of them finely carved and often inlaid with shell, and items of personal appar Figure 10. Gorget M3487, Solomon Is. 8o Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="11">el and adornment. The following handful of items can only give an idea of the spread. Solomon Is. Among objects of spiritual importance there is a somewhat weathered 1896 nguzunguzu canoe prow ornament, the familiar form later produced in larg er (and thus impractical) sizes for tourists. It is a half figure with a large human head with a prognathic snout-like appearance, sometimes holding a fish or bird in its hands, inlaid with shell (cf. Biihler et al 1962:128; Brake et al 1979: 24-5, Meyer 1995:398-9). There are also six inlaid carvings in the round of the highly valued and fetishised bonito fish, four dated from the 1890s (cf.Biihler et al 1962: 136). In 1892 a large collection of Solomon Is ceremo nial wands — two dozen of them (plus three from Bougainville) — came from the Australian Museum.^ Among numerous functional items, a carved coconut shell container from Guadalcanal, donated in 1897, is very beautiful. There are a number of adzes.28 Among garments and adornments, an unusual eyeshade from Vella Lavella has a two-figure acces sion number suggesting a very early date; several dis coid pendants of polished white metamorphosed limestone (coral rock?); numerous beaded arm bands; a finely woven gorget (Fig. 10); a number of skirts (four dated 1897 from Guadalcanal); ear rings and sticks.29 Santa Cruz • Mask with early accession number • Particularly significant is a collection of half a dozen very fine kapkap pendants, clamshell discs with attached fine fret-work tortoiseshell decoration of frigate-birds and bonito (cf. Bùhler et al 1962: 50, who describe them as 'among the finest works in this material [tortoiseshell], cut out in a delicate manner almost like lace' (1962: 88)).30 • Two very finely woven banana fibre bags to hold lime gourds, one dated 1898; about 20 finely woven mats, four dated from the i890s;3i a number of dec orative hair combs. Vanuatu One of the strengths of the Museum's ethnograph ic collection is the material from Vanuatu, both in quantity and quality. Although again, like the Solomons, about half the collection is weapons, there is an extensive array of other interesting items, ranging from mid-i9th century ritual masks to shamanic items, baskets, and tapa cloth. The fol lowing are only a very few of the items I found par ticularly interesting: 32 • A skull overmodelled with fibre and painted, from Malekula (cf. Meyer 1995: 424-5); • Three masks from Malekula, all old, one (ceramic j anus-head base, tall cane hat covered with cobwebs) provenanced to 1899 (Capt. Leah); • An adze with with carved face painted harle quin-like in red and blue, collected on Epi I. by Kev.rrazer probably late 19th century (rig. 11). • Two strings of shell money from Mere Lava I., collected pre-1922. • A double-strand necklace, made of tightly packed discs cut and drilled from coconut-shell.

Adze M126, Epi I., Vanuatu July 1997 81</page><page sequence="12">• 3 loom-woven banana-fibre penis-wrappers from Pentecost I, two pre-1899, ranging from 2.5cm to 9cm in width; • Shaman's items: belt with pendant rattles of candlenuts dated 1892 (missionary Frazer); sorcery stone ('netik') from Tanna pre-1924; • Several fans and very finely-woven square-base baskets dating from 1892 to early 20th century. Loyalty Is/New Caledonia There is little beyond a few unprovenanced clubs from New Caledonia. There are, however, several water gourds with fine sinnet binding and straps, notably one outstanding example in perfect condi tion. Mi cron esia/Po ly nesia There are fewer than 50 objects from Tuvalu and Kiribati, but they are varied in type, including: shell money, adze, tattooing instrument, headrests, mats and fans, fish-hooks, rat-trap, digging stick, and coconut crusher. • Of note are one complete and one partial coconut fibre armor cuirass (without helmets or trousers, but with five shark-tooth swords, a club, and two spears held separately).^ Polynesia is not well represented overall; apart from Fiji, which while culturally hybrid tends to be most strongly Polynesian. There is only a small amount of material from Central Polynesia. Fiji The Fijian material is the Museum's fourth largest holding, after Australia, Papua New Guinea (includ ing offshore islands) and the Solomon Is. However, since I have already published a comprehensively illustrated and still-available catalogue of the Fijian material in this collection (Ewins 1988a). I will not repeat that information here, but merely re-state that, being significantly based on missionary collec tions from the second and third quarters of the 19th century, it possesses some fine objects over a wide range. Of particular note is the duck-form priest's kava dish or buburau (cover illustration of the cata logue), of which as far as I know only four exist, two in the Fiji Museum, one in the Sainsbury Collection at the University of East Anglia, and this one.34 Tonga There are only about 30 items that are definitely Tongan: • 15 pieces of bark-cloth, most of them certain ly Tongan, some either Lau (Fiji) or Tonga; • half a dozen clubs. Other items such as combs and headrests I have detailed in Fijian Artefacts (Ewins 1982a), as there was such thorough interchange between the two groups in certain classes of artifacts by the mid-i9th century that it is very difficult to be definitive. Samoa There are around 100 items ascribed to Samoa, only about 20% of them weapons (clubs and spears). Notable are: • 8 fine mats, at least three collected around the turn of the century (Rev.Newall and Dr. Collingwood) • Nearly 30 fans, some clearly very old and beau tifully made, representing many district fan designs though none have provenances/dates (Fig. 12)'5 Figure 12. Fan M666, Samoa. • 16 skirts, 6 with very early accession numbers suggesting 1880s date, 2 dated 1898, 2 from 1915. • 18 pieces of bark cloth, 8 of them from collec tors active around the turn of the century. 37 • 8 baskets, several evidently old though only one dated to 1915 (M.Wolfhagen donor). • A small kupesi rubbing-block for figuring siapo bark-cloth 82 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="13">Figure 13. Model double canoe M2610, Manihiki I., Cook Is. Niue There are over 20 objects from Niue, an island not prolifically represented in most museums. Nearly half are weapons — 8 spears and a club, but there are two pieces of beautifully figured hiapo bark-cloth and a delicately decorated ike bark-cloth beater, two fans (one dated 1915) and two model canoes. Cook Is There are a couple of dozen articles attributed to the Cook Islands, most of them stone tools (adzes/axes). • Notable are two fine model canoes from Manihiki, collected prior to 1920 (Fig. 13). These are typical models of Manihiki double canoes, with the heads (correctly) in opposite directions. Possibly made specifically for sale to travelers, and found in a number of major museum collections (see detailed discussion and illustrations in Haddon &amp; Hornell (1936)1975:176-94). Austral Is There are two ceremonial items only, one a paddle (excellent condition) and one a long-handled kava ladle (damaged), both from Ra'ivavae and typical in form and intricate carving. They are not large, as later versions made specifically for tourists tended to become, so one might speculate that they may be early (cf. Meyer 1995: 536-7; Brake et al 1975:144). Society Is./Tahiti andHawai'i There is hardly any material from Eastern Polynesia in the collection. There are two white bark-cloths typical of Eastern Polynesia, and one patterned bark-cloth beater from Hawai'i. There is a necklet and a basket both attributed to Hawai'i but with no firm provenance. There is nothing from the Marquesas or Tuamotu archipelagos or from Easter Is. New Zealand It might have been expected, given its close prox imity to Tasmania, that the quantity of New Zealand material would have been greater (there are about 150 objects), though some of what is held is of quite a high standard, having been obtained at an earlier date in exchanges with New Zealand museums, in particular Wellington. Notable are:5** • A flax cloak (Fig. 14) and 9 flax skirts, some ornamented with wool and/or feathers. • A group of fine flax bags, one covered with kiwi feathers; • A strangely baroque bag with looped tree bast (hibiscus?) • A wakahuia treasure-box for storing jade items and the feathers of the huia bird (cf.Meyer 1995: 555); • A carved canoe prow; • A particularly finely-carved wooden patu with a tattooed head at the end of the handle, and a reclin July 1997 83</page><page sequence="14">Figure. 14. Flax &amp; kiwi feather bag M4671, New Zealand ing figure at the junction of handle and blade; NW Americas Although it is strictly speaking outside the Oceania region I am surveying, I should mention a collec tion of objects from the Northwest Native American and Eskimo peoples, over 60 of them Inuit. While the collection is not particularly large, and prove nances are patchy, the objects are predominantly 19th century, including some quite old objects from the Aleutian chain, and some appear to my non-spe cialist eye to be quite unusual. To mention just a few among these: • A thin-wood conical man's hat from Behring Strait dated pre-1850; • A sealskin sock, and pairs of sealskin mittens, slippers (beaded) and boots — all in remarkably good condition; • A Tlingit spoon with carved wolf-heads with blue shell (abalone?) inlay eyes; • A pre-1922 Inuit basket woven from baleen, with a carved bone wolf's head as a handle on the lid; • A small basket from Southern Alaska with col ored weaving decoration, including depictions of whales; • A belt covered with teeth that resemble small human incisors (seals??); • A harpoon foreshaft with bone head, wooden shaft and a long greenhide line) and several scab bards.^39 This unusual component of the collection deserves to be looked at by an expert in the materi al culture of that area. Conclusion Taken as a whole, the TMAG collection of Oceanic ethnographic material is not exceptional but it does have some exceptional pieces. It holds its own rea sonably well in the context of Australian museums, particularly given Tasmania's relative population base (there are still fewer than half a million people 84 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="15">in the whole ofTasmania, compared with three and a half million in Sydney alone). It is remarkable less for quantity than for quality, and for that it can thank its early entry to the field, its enthusiastic founders, and the fate that located some remarkable collectors here. There are probably few museums that would not wish that more scholars came and used their collections, enriching them with their insights. The TMAG is certainly no exception. My view would be that in the areas of Eastern and Island PNG and Vanuatu, as well as NW America, such scholars would be well rewarded by a careful review of the holdings, as I was fifteen years ago when I 'dis covered' the Fijian material here. There are not great numbers of objects to tempt Polynesianists, even less so Micronsianists, but if they are in the area they should still contact the Museum (write to the Director), for even in these domains there are unex pected treasures. 4- Typical of many generations of social anthropol ogists, the Cambridge don Edmund Leach (1864:40) took a limited 'instrumental' view of objects, observing: "Crudely stated, the argu ment is about whether toolmaking or language is the more fundamental. Is this 'thing in itself,' culture, to be "explained" by considering objec tive facts about the technical adaptation of man to his environment? Or is culture a product of the human imagination which exists only in the mind rather than as a material interface between man and the world of nature?" (1984: 40). I take the contrary view, succinctly stated as follows: "The underlying premise is that human-made objects reflect, consciously or unconsciously, directly or indirectly, the beliefs of the individu als who commissioned, fabricated, purchased, or used them and, by extension, the beliefs of the larger society to which these individuals belonged" (Prown 1993: 1) 5. Like many of the characteristics of human behav ior laid claim to a trifle over-zealously by post modernists, self-construction is as old as time. It uses the tools at hand in the period in question, and the construction aimed at is normally one that is considered desirable to the group with which the person wishes to be identified. The most extensive and best-documented discussion of this phenomenon is by Pierre Bourdieu [(I979)I9921 - 6. Though not of pottery. 7. This extended, unsurprisingly, to anthropolo gists in due course. Annette Weiner has pointed out that Malinowski, while perceptively identi fying the male Kula trade network, appeared to not even see the female contribution to eco nomics in the form of banana-leaf wealth (or if he did, to understand that it could be important as the male form — either way, he did nothing to document it). 8. Originally founded in 1843 as The Botanical and Horticultural Society of Van Diemen's Land, in 1844 this society received a royal charter and became The Royal Society of Van Diemen's Land for Horticulture, Botany and the Advancement of Science. The descriptors were dropped in 1848, and their brief expanded with typically Victorian fulsomeness to include "the advance ment of agriculture, horticulture, agricultural Notes I should like to thank Patricia Sabine, Director, for her ready cooperation on this and other occa sions; Alison Melrose for assistance with the online catalogue; Simon Cuthbert for his skilled photography and in particular Debbie Robertson for patiently working through the collection with me. 1. The Museum is currently transferring all of its records to computer but the task is incomplete. Once it is complete it is hoped that it may become possible, by accessing the Museum's website, to browse the list. 2. I have described this in Ewins (1982a.), which is still available. 3. Some curators are at last recognizing this fact. An outstanding example is the Anthropology Museum in the University of British Columbia, where visitors are able to enter the store-rooms, which have huge racks in which most of the objects and their numbers are visible, with cata logue and descriptive information separately available to visitors in the same space. While this is clearly not possible in all museums, an alter native approach would be to substitute didactic exhibitions on specific topics for all or part of the 'standing collection of isolated objects, which has too often hardly been changed for decades.

"In 1855 the name Van Diemen's Land to was changed to Tasmania, and in 1863 the Royal Society opened its museum on the cur rent site. 9. The list includes: Capt.

Williams [5 items, Solomon Is]; Lt. Willis [HMS Goldfinch 1897, 5 items Santa Cruz and Solomon Is]; Capt. Wilson [HMS "Duff"? 2 items NZ]. The close conjunction of dates and PNG/Santa Cruz/Solomon Is. sources in the late 1890s could suggest that some of these collectors were shipmates. 10. The identification of Le Hunte is my own deduc tion from available facts — the donor is merely identified in the records as 'Lt.Gov. of Brit.N.G.' with the date of 1906 (after it had become Australian Papua). 11. Perhaps a short piece by someone who knows this part of the TMAG collection particularly well might be included in a subsequent issue of PPANews.
