<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES THE CHANGE IN THE CONCEPTION OF RELIGION IN DEUTERONOMY by Moshe Weinfelb {pp. 1-17) Since De Wette till today the problem of Josiah's reform has never ceased to occupy Biblical scholars. Indeed this all-important problem warrants discussion and clarification of all its aspects. But to our regret the discussions on this subject have been confined to its cultic implications only. In actuality the reform gave rise to a revolution in all areas of the Israelite religion, a fact that has not hitherto been sufficiently emphasised. The centralisation of cult admittedly constitutes an enormous change in the religious history of Israel but the concomitants of the reform are even more decisive. The abolition of provincial cults caused the divorcement of the religious life of most of the populace from the domain of the priest and the sanctuary (See Y. Kaufman, Toledot Ha'emuna Hayyisre'elit, vol. 2, p. 272). This had repercussions in all spheres of Israelite religion. I wish to survey from this viewpoint three important spheres: 1) cult; 2) sacral conception; 3) the conceptions of God and of the Sanctuary. 1. Cult: In Deuteronomy we do not find that sacrifices are offered for their own sake. God does not require the sweet savour of the sacrifice (Cf. Gen. viii 21; 1 Sam. xxvi, 19 as well as the many passages in P). There is no trace here of the sacrifice as "a fire offering to the Lord" or as "the bread of God". It is not for nothing that public offerings such as the daily offering and the additional offerings of the festivals which constituted the essence of the Divine service in the central sanctuary are entirely missing from here (See 2 Kings xvi 13-15). The sacrifice in Deut. chiefly serves two purposes: a) a social one — the inclusion of the poor and destitute in the sacrificial feast; b) a religious personal one: the fulfilment of a religious duty and the expression of thanks to God through payment of a vow. The sacrifice itself is not necessary to God. It constitutes merely an expression of thanks and in this lies its whole importance. The sacrifice itself is secondary; the essential thing is the good intention behind it. Indeed cultic ceremonies in Deut. are accompanied by prayers and thanksgivings (Deut. xxi 1-9; xxvi 1-15) in contrast to these in P, which are implemented amidst complete silence. The other ritual laws are similarly conceived in a more rational sense than in other Pentateuchal sources. The tithe which hitherto belonged to the sacral sphere (Gen. xiv 20; xxviii 22; Lev. xxvii 30-33) becomes here the property of the owners. What is more, it may be turned over to secular use through monetary redemption. Indeed in the law of the redemption of tithes in Deuteronomy (xiv 24-26), the liberation of cult from its close link to nature finds expression. Sanctity does not adhere to the very naturalia which have been sanctified, but constitutes a function of the religious intention of the consecrator. The firstborn herd and flock which had likewise hitherto belonged to the sphere of the sanctuary are eaten, according to Deuteronomy, by the owners themselves in the precincts of the sanctuary. Perhaps it is no accident that, in this book, laws concerning the firstborn of man and of unclean beasts are entirely absent, although these precepts are rooted in ancient Israelite culture. The book of Deuteronomy evidently does not recognise sanctity which bears the character of taboo exclusively. This fact stands out too in the precept of the Paschal lamb. Whilst in sources JE and Ρ</page><page sequence="2">II SUMMARIES the domestic Paschal sacrifice involves apotropaic ceremonies, in D the Passover becomes a public sacrifice, divorced from any magic-animistic associations. This leads us to the sacral conception in Deuteronomy. 2. The Conception of Holiness: The source of holiness according to Ρ is the sanct ■uary of the Lord and His Tabernacle in Israel. Therefore the priests who are closest to the Tabernacle of the Lord are commanded to take special care regarding their purity. Only the priests are forbidden to partake of carrion (Lev. xxii 8; cf. Ezek. xliv 31) and to "make baldness" on their head (Lev. xxi 5) and this because they offer "the bread of their God". It is otherwise in Deuteronomy. Here all the people are equally holy and therefore the ordinary Israelite is forbidden to partake of carrion (xiv 20) and make baldness (xiv 1). Holiness in this book does not derive from the existence of the Lord's tabernacle but from the fact that the Lord had chosen Israel. The holiness of the people, prominently emphasised in Deuteronomy, has its counterpart in Ρ in the holiness of the land. The soil constitutes here the sacral basis of the Israelite community. Therefore all who dwell on holy soil, both homeborn and stranger, are obliged to guard themselves against uncleanness. If they defile the land it will vomit them (Lev. xviii 29). In Deuteronomy the people, i.e. the ethnic Israelite element is holy, excluding the stranger who, though he dwells in the land, is not governed by the obligation of holiness (cf. Lev. xiii 15 with Deut. xiv 21). Bloodshed according to Ρ defiles the land in which God dwells; therefore the land requires atonement (Num. xxxv 33-34), whilst according to Deut. it is the people who require atonement in the case of murder and not the land (xxi 8). 3. The Conception of God and the Sanctuary: In the previous section we noted that holiness in the book of Deuteronomy is conceived in a more abstract sense and does not involve a territorial material basis. The same applies to the conception of God. God, according to Deuteronomy, does not require a house or tabernacle. His seat is on high and from there He looks down on the earth (xxvi 15). Only God's name dwells in the sanctuary but not He Himself (See G. Von Rad, Deuteronomium Studien, S. 26) and this runs counter to previous conceptions according to which God Himself dwells in the sanctuary (Ex. xv 17; xxv 8; xxix 45; Isa vi 1; Amos ix 1 etc). This conception finds expression also in the descriptions of the revelation in Deutero nomy. According to Ex. xix, God went down to mount Sinai and from there made his voice heard to Moses and the people, whereas in Deuteronomy, God proclaimed his word from His seat in heaven, but it was transmitted to Israel through the great fire on the mount: "Out of heaven He made thee to hear His voice that He might instruct thee and upon earth He made thee see His great fire and thou didst hear His words out of the midst of the fire" (iv 36). Another fact in which may be discerned a kind of avoidance of anthropomorphism is that the centre of gravity of revelation shifts here from seeing to hearing. Whilst in Ex. xix, the chief danger is: "lest they break through to the Lord to see" (xix 21), in Deuteronomy, the danger lies in the hearing of the voice of God (iv 33). The ark in Deuteronomy is not regarded as the chariot of God or His seat as con ceived in previous periods (1 Sam. iv 4; 2 Kings xix 15; Ps. lxxx 1 as well as in Ρ: Ex. xxv 22 etc.) but serves as an article of furniture for housing the tables of stone. The chief importance of the ark lies in the fact that the Torah which embodies the covenant made between God and His people is kept therein. The most sacred piece of furniture in the Israelite cult serves a purely educational function.</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES ΙΠ In the light of the above, it is natural to ask what is the source of all these liberal ideas? In another place (Ziqqato shel Sefer Devarim Labokhma, Kaufman Jubilee volume 5721), I dwelt on the connection between the Wisdom circles and the book of Deutero nomy, and it seems to me that this change in Deuteronomy which is distinguished by its rationalistic and anti-mythical character may be credited to the wise men — the cultured class of those days — who began to apply themselves to the Torah (Jer. viii 8) which had hitherto been the exclusive preserve of the priests. THE HALF-SHEKEL IN THE SCROLLS OF THE JUDEAN DESERT SECT by J. Liver {pp. 18-22) The article deals with a fragment of the Scrolls published by J.M. Allegro (JSS VI pp. 71-73 [1961]). The end of row 8 of the fragment must be completed by the words: ."'לחמש המאות חמשת מניס" With the insertion of this addition based on the Pentateuchal text all the figures in rows 8-9 and their order become intelligible. The order of the figures concerning the shekel donors in the scroll corresponds thus exactly to the order of figures in Ex. xxxviii 25-26 and the sum of money collected fits in with that in the Biblical text. The scroll is therefore concerned with explaining the Pentateuchal text. This filling in of the lacuna in the text whose certainty can be vouched for gives us the length of the line in the whole fragment. Therefore only the last third of each line is missing. This determination of the length of the line enables us to overcome the difficulty in Allegro's explanation of lines 3-5. According to Allegro lines 3-4 are an amplification of the Biblical law of Deut. xxiii 25-26 which line 5 deals with; the prohibition of taking away the corn or the fruit in the field does not apply after it has been gathered. But this explanation which is based on the assumption that only one word has to be supplied to complete these lines is untenable; for what logic is there in being strict, when the produce is still attached to the ground, and taking a lenient view with regard to gathered produce, which the owners have had the trouble of harvesting? Since at the ends of these lines a number of words have to be supplied it seems likely that here we have the explanation to Deut. xxiv 19-21, exactly as the subsequent line is an explanation of Deut. xxiii 25-26. The whole text, to the extent that we may judge from the fragment available is an explanation and elaboration of texts in the Pentateuch. It is certainly not a collection of laws designed for particular circumstances. At the same time, according to the sect's conception — as to that of Judaism in general — the laws of the Torah have basically the validity of halakha. In the fragment available it is stated with regard to the half-shekel of the Pentateuch "אשר נתנו איש כפר נפשו" "דק [פעם] אחת יתננו כול ימיו"! and it is obvious that the sect would not explain the law of the half-shekel in Ex. xxxviii 25-26 in a manner con flicting with the accepted halakha, that is to say, if the annual offering of a half-shekel had been accepted by the people for many generations previously. Evidently the obligation of rendering the annual half-shekel offering for the needs of the Temple was fixed only after the members of the Judean desert sect had separated themselves from the rest of the people and the Temple. The emphasis of "רק [פעם] אחת יתננו כול ימיו", too, which does not of necessity follow from Scripture, originated in the opposition</page><page sequence="4">IV SUMMARIES of the sect to the annual offering of the half-shekel to the Temple which the Sages wished to link to the half-shekel of the Torah. This evidence from the scrolls combines with other data indicating that the ruling concerning an annual half-shekel offering to the Temple came into force only at the end of the Hasmonean period or even a little later (Cf. my article: Parashat Mahazit Hashsheqel, ■Kaufman Jubilee Volume 5721, pp. 54-67); that is after the members of the Judean Desert sect became divorced from the rest of the Jewish people. the significance of the technical expression אלא אי איתמר הכי איתמר IN THE BABYLONIAN TALMUD by Hyman Klein דיל (pp. 23-42) The present article is a continuation of the writers's researches in the analysis of the Talmudic sugya. In previous articles published in the Jewish Quarterly Review (vol umes xxxviii, pp. 67-91; xliii, 341-363; 1, 124-146) the writer has shown how the Talmudic sugya is made up of two parts, a basic element (which he denotes as gemara) and additional interpretative discussion (which he terms sevara). In addition to estab lishing a number of objective criteria for distinguishing between the gemara and the sevara of a sugya, the writer has demonstrated that the compilers of the sevara in their dealing with the explanation of the basic gemara developed a unified terminology to deal with all gemara elements of similar external form. It was not the content of the gemara which determined the present structure of the Talmudic sugya, but rather the outer form. The use of similar technical expressions in different sugyot is an indication of the essential similarity, in external form, of the elements making up the gemara. The present article which deals with all the 55 places where the technical expression אלא אי איתמר הכי איתמר occurs in the Talmudic sugya is a follow-up of previous re searches by the writer (in the articles mentioned above) with regard to the technical expressions ,לאו בפירוש איתמר אלא מכללא איתמר, איכא דרמי לה מירמא and איבעיא להו (where the discussion is in Aramaic and not in Hebrew). Other scholars, notably Abraham Weis, have written at length on the technical phrase אלא אי איתמר etc., but none from the point of view of attempting to achieve a solution to the problem which would hold equally for all places in the sugya where the term occurs. The writer finds that the phrase אלא אי איתמר etc. is a technical expression form ulated by the authors of the sevara in their attempt to find a connection in the basic gemara between an נ Amoraic dictum and the particular piece of gemara which follows immediately upon it. The gemara following upon an 'Amoraic dictum in those cases where the term אלא אי איתמר etc. occurs is either a later 'Amoraic dictum which limits the application of the first dictum or a Tannaitic statement in conflict with the dictum. The question the authors of the sevara attempted to answer for themselves in their exposition of the sugya was: Why did the compilers of the gemara make the juxta position just as they did? The writer shows that in those places where an earlier 'Amoraic dictum is followed by a later limiting one in the basic gemara, the authors of the sevara felt that the purpose of the later dictum, placed immediately after the earlier one, was to indicate that the first 'Amoraic dictum could not be accepted without limitation or explanation. They saw this as the underlying principle posited by the compilers of the gemara in</page><page sequence="5">SUMMARIES determining the type of gemara and the particular place of a given piece of gemara. Now the compilers of the basic gemara themselves did not say what were the particular difficulties which stood in the way of accepting the original ,Amoraic dictum without limitation or explanation. The authors of the sevara, therefore, made it their task to indicate these difficulties. They did this through the use of the phrase^D מתקיף לה ד'. Following upon such indication, the authors of the sevara would then postulate a re formulation of the basic ,Amoraic dictum which would contain in itself the explanation or the limitation found in the later ,Amoraic statement. This reformulation would be introduced by the technical expression אלא אי איתמר etc. Such would be their procedure where a later ,Amoraic dictum would conflict with an earlier one. Where, however, a Tannaitic source would appear to be in conflict with the ,Amoraic dictum, the authors of the sevara worked under the basic assumption that the 5 Amora would obviously not oppose the point of view as expressed in the Tannaitic source. They would "emend", therefore, wherever possible, the original ,Amoraic statement by introducing into it some limiting phrase which would place it in harmony with the Tannaitic source. Where this would not suffice to remove the difficulty, the authors of the sevara would not hesitate to replace the original ,Amoraic dictum with a completely different statement which would not conflict with the Tannaitic source. These new formulations would also be indicated by the technical phrase אלא אי איתמר etc. The authors of the sevara had this fundamental outlook upon the work of the com pilers of the gemara who preceded them: Wherever the officially compiled gemara was made up of an ,Amoraic dictum and a conflicting Tannaitic source, the purpose of this juxtaposition was not simply to contradict the accepted version of the ,Amoraic dictum, but rather to teach the correct halakha. Where this could be done only by positing a completely different formulation of the dictum, the authors of the sevara felt it to be their task to find such formulation. The technical phrase אלא אי איתמר etc. was the invention of the authors of the sevara in order to arrive at an understanding of what the compilers of the gemara had in mind when they placed a particular gemara next to an ,Amoraic dictum. Juxta position, in other words, was in itself taken to be comment by the compilers of the gemara. Not always, however, is there such juxtaposition ("comment"). In these cases, we cannot know the purpose of the compilers. There are many sugyot, however, or, to be more exact, many ,Amoraic dicta where the authors of the sevara found it necessary that they themselves explain or emend the given dictum upon the basis of some conflicting Tannaitic source. These emendations as well would be introduced by the phrase אלא אי איתמר etc., which, in terms of the external pattern they themselves had set for dealing with basic gemara, made it seem as if their own contributions as well stemmed from the gemara itself. In all these last instances, however, all such juxta position or "comment" is given anonymously, and this is the key for determining that the juxtaposition is not basic gemara but the later addition of the authors of the sevara. Care must therefore be taken not to confuse the prime use of the technical expression אלא אי איתמר etc. as a means of determining what the compilers of the gemara had in mind in arranging their material as they did with the secondary use of the same phrase to justify the emendation or explanation of the authors of the sevara themselves. In a very few instances a new reading has already been introduced by the compilers of the gemara and hence is itself part of the basic gemara. The use of the technical term אלא אי איתמר etc. is here misleading, giving the impression that the new reading</page><page sequence="6">VI SUMMARIES 1's only the suggestion of the authors of the sevara. Logically, the authors of the sevara should have created a special technical term to deal with such instances. They preferred, however, to use an accepted and easily understood term, even though not strictly ap plicable, to creating a new term which might prove difficult to understand, as its use would be restricted to those few instances. LETTERS BY GE'ONIM by S. Abramson {pp. 43-58) I. Mss. T-S 10 G 5s (=1) and T-S 20.100 (=2) are but two fragments of one leaf. J. Mann, Texts 8t Studies I, pp. 160-161 has published part I and although he had had before him both fragments, he failed to recognize the connection between the two. Indeed he described fragment 2 {ibid., p. 122) erroneously. The Mss. contain a letter of condolence to a person at the death of his son. The letter is arranged in ten paragraphs and tries to express some ideas how a man can find comfort in his great sorrow. Mann (ibid., pp. 149-150) ascribed the letter to R. Samuel b. Hofni, because it was his method to arrange his remarks under a numerical grouping, but one must bear in mind that this was also the method of R. Se'adya on the one hand, and of R. Israel, the son of R. Samuel, on the other. Furthermore, there are some similarities of ideas in this letter and in R. Se'adya's '"Emunot". No final conclusion about the writer of this letter can be made as yet. In passing, Maimonides' view on the rewarding of animals (Guide III, 17) is explained in this paper (against Aptovitzer, HUCA III, pp. 117 seq.). II. Ms. Adler 2742, paper, is a letter by R. Samuel b. Hofni written to a certain "Alluf", who asked for copies of two of R. Samuel's books: his commentary to the portion "Huqqat" and his "Introduction to the Mishna and Talmud". R. Israel, R. Samuel's son, added greetings to the Alluf. Several names are mentioned in the letter, but none of them are known to me from elsewhere. (To be continued) AN ELEGY ON THE EXPULSION FROM SPAIN by Haim Hilel Ben-Sasson {pp. 59-71) The author publishes here from MS Giinzburg Fol. 214, 157-159 (according to a microfilm in the Ben-Zvi Institute) an Elegy (qina) on the Spanish Expulsion in 1492. The author is Abraham ben Solomon ibn Buqarat. The qina is composed of 40 quatrains. The author prefaced a kind of prose pro logue (most of Fol. 159r). The writer explains in an introduction all that is known of the author of the qina. Abraham is the author of the commentary to Rashi on the Pentateuch printed at Leghorn in 1845. He was born in Malaga and till 1486 lived under Moslem rule; ibn Buqarat knew Arabic and Castilian. His commentary to Rashi and the qina indicate that he was meticulous with his concepts and facts. He was a scholar of the Spanish Jewish cultural genre. Abraham was known in the period of the Expulsion as a poet whose poems were permeated with messianic yearnings.</page><page sequence="7">SUMMARIES ΥΠ From the internal evidence of the qina— both its contents and omissions — the writer determines that it was probably composed before 1497. An analysis of the motifs of this qina and the only other one hitherto known to us from the Expulsion period — that of Solomon ben Samuel Hassefaraddi — and a comparison of them both indicates, according to the writer, that the composers of both laments recognised the sinister implications of the expulsion (though there are differences in the description of it and the indication of its aims in the two dirges). On the one hand, Solomon's lament re fleets the terrible experiences of the actual moments of forced departure from Spain that he witnessed, whilst Abraham's dirge, on the other hand, mirrors the grim reality of the life of the refugees in North Africa in particular. The content of the Expulsion edict (including the dates of its signature and its execu tion), the imparting of the number of exiles, the victims of death and disease and of the returnees to Spain and a depiction of the sufferings in North Africa in the qina and its prologue are all conveyed in a direct unvarnished manner borne out in most of their particulars from internal and external sources. HISTORY OF THE PILGRIMAGE TO MERON by Abraham Yaari {pp. 72-101) The tombs of Rabbi Simeon b. Yohai and his son R. 'El'azar at Meron are the most authentic of all venerated tombs in Galilee, since they are already mentioned in Talmudic and Midrashic literature, while the tradition of most of the other tombs does not go back beyond the 12th century. Yet they are not mentioned by the two travellers of the twelfth century: Benjamin of Tudela and Petahya of Regensburg, who visited Meron. Other pilgrims who did mention them paid more attention to the tombs of Hillel and Shammai, about which all sorts of miracles are told. From the beginning of the 14th century to the middle of the 16th century we hear of an annual day of pilgrimage to the tombs of Hillel and Shammai in Meron on the 15th of Iyyar. The main feature of this pilgrimage was prayers for a rainy year and water miracles. In that pilgrimage Jews and Arabs alike participated, and it is recorded also by the Arab authors al-Dimishqi and al-eOthmani. It was only in the second part of the 16th century that the annual pilgrimage to Meron changed its date, place and character. It was transferred from the tombs of Hillel and Shammai to those of R. Simeon b. Yohai and his son, from the 15th of Iyyar (Pesah Sheni) to the 18th of Iyyar (Lag Ba'omer), and changed its character from water festivities into light and fire festivities, a character which it has retained to the present day. What brought about this change? The theory that it was caused by the appearance of Cabbalist circles at Safad in those days is untenable, since in all the numerous Cabbalist sources about pilgrimages to the tomb of R. Simeon the date of Lag Ba'omer is never mentioned, and as far as there was a specific annual period for the Cabbalist pilgrimage to those tombs, it was the ten days preceding the Feast of Shavu'ot and the Feast of Rosh-Hashshana. These dates were observed by the Cabbalists even two centuries after the initiation of the new popular festivities at Meron on Lag Ba'omer. The only mention of the Lag Ba'omer festivities at Meron in Cabbalistic literature is a story attributed to R. Hayyim Vital in which he tells that his great master R. Isaac</page><page sequence="8">Yin SUMMARIES Luria, in the year of his arrival from Egypt (ca. 1570), made a pilgrimage to Meron with his family on Lag Ba'omer. The story has come down to us in four different versions, in all of which the apologetic motive is explicitly stressed. The writer tells the story to justify new-fangled festivities. In the latest version something entirely new was added, namely that the festivities on Lag-Bacomer are connected with the anni versary of the death of R. Simeon b. Yohai, a fact never mentioned before anywhere in Cabbalistic literature, and certainly an invention of the author of that late version. It is contended here that the story itself is not true, as it is in disagreement with Luria's views as recorded by Vital himself, and has been invented to justify the character of the festivities in Meron on Lag Ba'omer. In the author's view the initiation of the pilgrimage to R. Simeon ben Yohai's tomb on Lag Ba'omer was the result of the forced discontinuation of a similar pilgrimage elsewhere. Since the 12th century the mountain Nebi Samwil near Jerusalem was con sidered to be Rama, the burial place of the prophet Samuel. An annual pilgrimage was held there on the 28th of Iyyar, the traditional anniversary of the prophet's death, in which Jews from all over the East participated. This popular pilgrimage had to be stopped when the prophet's tomb was occupied by the Arabs of Jerusalem sometime between 1565 and 1570. A new place had to be found for the popular pilgrimage far away from the fanatic Moslems of Jerusalem. Meron near Safad in Galilee replaced Nebi Samwil near Jerusalem; the tomb of R. Simeon b. Yohai replaced the tomb of the prophet Samuel; the date was fixed on Lag Ba'omer (18th of Iyyar), which had already been considered a semi-holiday, a date which was just between the date of the early pilgrimage at Meron (15th of Iyyar) and the date of the pilgrimage at Nebi Samwil (18th of Iyyar). All the features of the pilgrimage to the tomb of the prophet Samuel, such as the lighting of beacons and the first cutting of the hair of young boys, features connected with the early life of the prophet, were also transferred to Meron, although they had no connection with the life of Rabbi Simeon b. Yohai. This transfer did not pass without opposition. Rabbinic authorities, from R. Joseph Caro in Safad in the 16th century to Rabbi Moses Sofer of Pressburg and Rabbi Joseph Saul Natanson of Lwow in the 19th century, strongly opposed the character of the new pilgrimage. However the popular need for such a pilgrimage prevailed. The Cabbalists in Safad continued their own old pilgrimage to the tomb on the week preceding Shavu'ot and Rosh-Hashshana, and preserved its pristine character of pray ers, study and meditation. A MESSIANIC POEM OR A SONNET TO HEROISM? by Jonah David {pp. 102-104) In the Isaac Baer Jubilee volume (pp. 374-397) I. Tishbi published an article entitled "The Messianic Ferment in the Circle of M.H. Luzzatto etc.". At the end of the study he cited two poems dubbed by him as "messianic". The second poem which was published from the Ginzburg MS (B 202) is a sonnet to Heroism and not a messianic poem — similar to another poem on that same theme which appears as a prologue to his drama Ma'ase Shimshon. In both of them the figure of Heroism appears in the camp of Dan in order to deliver the people from the oppression of the Philistine enemy, Thus there exists a thematic and linguistic parallel between both the aforementioned poems.</page><page sequence="9">SUMMARIES IX EMENDATIONS TO A RELIGIOUS POEM OF SHEMU'EL HANNAGID by Dov Yarden (p. 105) A SUGGESTED SOLUTION OF A RIDDLE BY JUDAH HALLEWI by J. Razahvi (p. 106) BOOK REVIEW PAUL WINTER, "ON THE TRIAL OF JESUS" by David Flusser (pp. 107-117) The most important achievement of P. Winter's book lies in the distinction he makes between the historical event, the primary report of the events and secondary tradition. It is clear that this method cannot produce a consistent picture of the trial of Jesus because, according to this view, the complex stratification of various traditions makes full reconstruction impossible. "It can be affirmed with assurance that Jesus was arrested by Roman military person nel for political reasons and then conducted to a local Jewish administrative authority during the same night. The following morning ... he was handed back to the Romans for trial. The procurator sentenced Jesus to death by crucifixion, this sentence being carried out in accordance with Roman court procedure" (Winter, p. 138). Among the things that, according to Winter, probably happened are the interrogation of Jesus by the high priest's representative and the derision shown by the Roman soldiers of the execution squad. "No certain answers can be given to the following questions: Firstly, what was the immediate cause inducing the authorities to take official action against Jesus? Secondly, who took the initiative in ordering the apprehension of Jesus? Thirdly, what precisely did Jesus do to provoke police action against himself?" (Winter, p. 138). It seems that we can be more optimistic than Winter and we can find a more con sistent picture of the trial if we place more faith in the veracity of the sources than the author did. The sources must be read with specific attention being paid only to the reported facts and not to the stress put on them. It seems to me therefore that more certainty about the circumstances surrounding the trial is possible than Winter will allow, but fundamentally his analysis is realistic and thus an important contribution to modern scholarship.</page></plain_text>
