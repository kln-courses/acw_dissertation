<plain_text><page sequence="1">Far Eastern Monkey Lore By U. A. Casal, Kobe Oriental art-and that of Japan particularly-frequently used the monkey as its subject or as an adjunct to some other illustra- tion. Monkeys, of the macaque type especially, abound in India (where many other tribes are also at home) and in the major parts of China; in Japan they were numerous in certain districts like the Nikko mountains, Kishfi, and the South1. And it is in Japan, undoubtedly, that the imitative and human-like animal has attained its apogee both as a symbol and as a decorative topic. In paintings like those by Mori Sosena of the Shijo schoolb (1747-1821) the monkey has certainly lost its symbolism. Sosen was a master in depicting monkeys; he loved them and their gambols; he lived for months at a time in the forests not far from Osaka, it is said, to study their movements and observe their mode of life. His pictures, superlatively natural and true to life in attitude and anatomy, breathe animation in every hair. Sosen was so wrapped up in his monkeys and their habits that he him- self, reputedly, took on something simian. To artists like N6amic (1397-1471) and Hasegawa T6hakud (1539-1610), on the other hand, the "funny" side of monkeydom evidently appealed more than the true shape. Their monkeys are "spidery", a furry composition with extremely long arms, looking very much like those modern toys made of thin entwined wires filled with bristly fibre and contortioned into odd and ludicrous forms. Their faces are blank circles with two dots, a triangle and 1 Ancient records show that monkey flesh served as a regular food to the Japanese.

Casal a dash, all close together, for eyes, nose and mouth. And yet, hanging from the scraggiest branches, or sitting on equally perfunctory trees, often with their young perched on the back, they, too, are "alive". They are "impossible", yet they are dis- tinctly and playfully monkeyish. We may say that to Sosen, Tohaku or the much older Chinese Mu Ch'ia (13th century) and quite a few lesser artists, the monkey appealed as worthy of their interpretation simply as an animal. Yet even they may at first have been influenced by some deeper consideration, a "reason" why they should paint their first monkey. The inducements, as we shall see, were many. Some can still be clearly recognized in present-day beliefs and symbolism; others have been lost or modified to such an extent as to be hazy in their identity. The monkey, wherever he lived wild, was considered rather an evil spirit. Prankish at best, he also robbed the early culti- vators of their food, whether of trees or fields. He stole various ob- jects from the home, was cantankerously verbose against passers- by,2 pelting them with stones or nuts, and knew how to combine into "armies" to fight the humans in their settlements. The monkey tribes resent any intrusion in their domain, which they vigorously defend; the natives of Africa and India are still careful not to give cause for offence and revenge, and keep away from monkey- infested forests. To these evil propensities was added a manlike behaviour in other respects, which made the monkey all the more "weird" and objectionable.3 Therefore he had quite naturally to be pro- pitiated: evil, like good (or more so), must be worshipped, and with many races the monkey became a deity. Furthermore, a live monkey, being so much like a human, could replace man in some respects. He could, for instance, be loaded with the sins of the community and be killed or chased back into the woods as a scapegoat. He thereby became a tutelary deity, protecting the 2 The violent vociferousness of monkeys sounds like a string of curses, and curses were always feared because of "the power of the word". 3 "Between a man and a monkey," say the Japanese, "there is only three hairs differe-nce." I have never been able to find out what three hairs. Of course, it indirectly means "very little", but there may be a deeper, now lost meaning to the simile. a 4!e</page><page sequence="3">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 15 community against these very sins. Sin, however, originally was nothing but behaviour which provoked certain evil forces or spirits, such as sickness and bad crops, death and famine. A primary factor in Far Eastern monkey lore is the fertility of these animals. The monkeys, like men, have only one or two young at a time, but are very prolific. They are believed to possess a long life (which is erroneous) and never to be ill. Concurrently, they are lascivious in the extreme, and lasciviousness has always formed part of communal fertility rites among the primitives, and until far into civilized epochs. On the importance of phallic worship in the Orient, particularly in Japan, we cannot here enlarge: it was, and partly is, of even greater concern to high and low than it was in Greece, especially, of course, to the farming class since their very life depended on a sufficient productivity of their fields. Of the phallic meaning of the monkey, however, the most prominent traits will appear in what follows. The extensive monkey ideology of India would demand a special study far in excess of the limits of this paper. It is as old as, or older than, the Vedas-perhaps basically as old as humanity. The battle of R-ama, the Hero, helped by Hanuman, the King of Monkeys, must be mentioned, however, as it is one of the most important legends of antiquity, and may be found insinuated in various ways in the parables of all of Asia. Rama, the perfect model of humanity, always championing Good, passionately serving Duty, lost his wife, Sita, through the wiles of Ravana, the king of the Rakshas (giants, evil spirits), who hid her in the wild island of Lanka (supposedly Ceylon). R-ama, in quest of her, encountered many difficulties, of which the greatest one was the "Ocean" which obstructed his passage to the island. Hanuman, with a marvellous jump, crossed the depths and ascertained Sita's whereabouts. Then, with the help of his legions of monkeys, he laid a solid bridge of boulders and planks, while some of them had to fight the attacking monsters of the deep by throwing rocks at them. Over the bridge Rama marched, to defend Ravana.4 It is the usual scheme: Humanity (Good, Ra- ma) fighting Death (Evil, Ravana) with the assistance of Fertility 4 Huang-ti AX too, the legendary emperor of China in the 27th century B.C., originator of civilization, in his many battles against savages and giants had animals as allies: tigers: panthers, bears, monkeys. But the same theme is also known outside of Asia.</page><page sequence="4">16 U. A. Casal (in this case the monkey tribe, Hanuman), so as to retain, or obtain, Life through Progeny (here represented by Sita, the Wife). But a perilous "bridge" must also be built, unless there is a regular "ferry," connecting "this shore" with the "other shore", and often animals offer to form it (fishes, crocodiles, tortoises etc.). But another legend may even more deeply have affected the monkey lore of the Far East, since it is Buddhist-or at least has been adopted by Buddhism. According to the Mahakdpi Jdtaka, an apologue which exalts Buddha's "perfection of energy", the Enlightened One in one of his former lives was a monkey king. His tribe of 80,000 monkeys did too much harm to the mango- trees,5 and the reigning king decreed their extermination. When the king's archers arrived, the monkeys had but one way of escape, across the Ganges. Swim they could not:6 a rope was there- fore made of twisted bamboo-strips, and the Bodhisattva-monkey bound it to the limb of a tree on their side of the river, with the other end tied around his waist. Then, in a tremendous leap, he crossed the river to fasten the rope to a tree on the opposite shore, thus forming a hanging bridge. But alas!-the rope was just slightly too short. All he could do was to hang on to a branch with both hands, and over the rope and his body the whole 80,000 monkeys climbed to safety. But, as always, an adversary was in the ranks. Devadatta, full of hatred for the altruistic leader, took advantage of his perilous position to brusquely drop onto his back, thus breaking his spine. The King of Benares gently placed the king of monkeys on a blanket, and before he expired, the Bodhisattva-monkey gave him good counsel as to the behaviour befitting a monarch. A famous monkey story-quite supernatural, in accordance with Taoist ideas-is found in Chinese Buddhism. It is the one of Sun Hou_tzua, the "Stone Monkey" (Japanese Son Gokfib), partly based on the Hanuman concept, partly on Taoistic feats of magic, and in its denouement swayed by Buddhist salvation. Like Hanuman, Sun was the "faithful servant"-this time in the 5 The mango in India corresponds to the peach in China, of which more later. 6 Saru no suiren M6DI7R, "a monkey learning to swim", is equi- valent to attempting the impossible, something contrary to one's nature. a MT b B</page><page sequence="5">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 17 service of Hsilan-chuang (Jap. Genz6a), a Buddhist monk who, between 629 and 645, undertook an extended voyage through In- ner Asia and India, whence he brought back many religious books and notes of great geographical, ethnographical and historical value. In the manifold allegory which surrounds this evidently historical pilgrimage, Sun, the Monkey, stands for the Human Mind, as the white Dragon-horse of the party, Pai-mab, represents the faithful Human Heart, willing to bear all loads without com- plaint, although his voice is at times "full of impatience". The third animal in the company is the Pig, Chuc, which rep- resents the uncontrolled Passions and Ignorance. His queer jumps (of the mind) lead Sun into many difficult situations, but he is also full of cleverness, and always extricates himself. He is agile, cunning, elastic, and at the same time can be incredibly strong, as is the human Intellect. He, originally born from a stone, lifeless but with a Mind, by the force of his Will first acquired Life, and then the power to transform himself into any size he desired, and into a variety of bodies without limit. By the magic shedding of his hair he could produce a cloud of tiny monkeys, each provided with an iron rod (as he himself usually carried), who could scratch and bite an enemy like an attacking army of wasps, the little difficulties, the "pinpricks" which may wear one out more thoroughly than larger problems.7 But his power makes him vainglorious; he is a chatterbox imbued with his own impor- tance, and he has to go through many tribulations on this account. He is finally caught in a valley between five high peaks; he tries every possible kind of transformation to obtain his freedom, but his magic has suddenly become useless; he, an infinitesimally small creature, finds himself in the palm of Buddha's hand, of which the five fingers form insuperable barriers. He submits to the highest power, Love, and at last finds salvation. The story, which in its inception is certainly considerably older, was made into a sort of mysterv play by a Chinese scholar of the 16th century, Wu Ch'eng-end. Partly educational or disci- plinal, it is full of gaiety, and the intense wisdom has therefore easily been absorbed-if not always understood-by the genera- 7 Bees and wasps appear in several Japanese legends as the emissaries of some divinity, to fight an unrighteous enemy with their stings. a j; b Et,% c E d XA</page><page sequence="6">18 U. A. Casal tions of four centuries. In Japan, the No stage has changed it into a morality play with less acted absurdity, but to this day greatly appreciated by the cultivated few. The masses know it as a fairy tale. In art, references to Sun Hou-tze in his many monkey moods appear in various guises.8 To these Indian-Buddhist influences must be added, in Japan, a phallic aspect originating in the native Shint6 creed. The Japanese have, in their mythology, a male and a female deity whose names are based on sarua, monkey, which term is also found in other connections. On the occasion of the Sun-goddess Amaterasu O-mikami'sb withdrawal into a "celestial cave" because her unruly brother, the Storm-god Susa-no-oc, had deeply offended her, the eight hundred myriad gods arranged a great festivity to make her come forth again. Cocks chanted, "music" was made, and there was general, if somewhat fictitious, jollity, so as to make her curious of what was going on in spite of her absence. The peak of this pandemonium was reached when Uzume-no-mikotod, the "Heaven-startling Female", mounted on an upturned tub and performed an immodest dance accompanied by a double entendre couplet, and accentuated by stamping on the wooden vessel. Then the gods did roar with laughter. This is plainly "fertility magic" of phallic conception. Uzume, or Usume, may itself rather mean "Mortar Female", and the tub may have been, or stood for, a mortar. We shall find the mortar later again; it, and the pestle, are among the most ancient and widely distributed phallic symbols. The "thumping" of the hollow platform to make it resound has the effect of provoking thunder, which means rain; dances of all kinds have always been connected with sex and fertility, being basically erotic; with many races, at stated rituals, naked women (the bearers of fertility) per- formed licentious dancing or posturing, often "clad" in a few 8 The story of this monkey, highly interesting from the folklor- istic and symbolical standpoint, may be found in E. T. C. Warner, Myths and Legends of China. An even more complete exposition of the legend and its meanings is The Buddhist Pilgrim's Progress by Helen M. Hayes. The description of a (shortened?) theatrical performance given before the late Empress Dowager of China will be found in Princess Der Ling's Two Years in the Forbidden City. a b X],E7;$ c IA dMC i</page><page sequence="7">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 19 creepers and with some leaves on their heads, as emblems of Nature, quite possibly as if they themselves (embodying the tree's powers) were bringing them forth-while singing ribald songs, intended to stimulate good harvests and plentiful progeny. Especially are such performances believed to procure rain, which does not preclude their being adopted also to entice the sun from "behind the rocks" of an eclipse. Uzume too, on this occasion, had unloosened her dress and girdled herself with various mosses, creepers and leaves; and it is remarkable that the crape-myrtle, in Japanese, is called saru- suberia, "monkey-slide", as if monkeys used it for a rope- perhaps, however, with an older and different meaning of suberi. Possibly this creeper is connected with the belief, found in ancient accounts, that the first "bridge" was constructed by monkeys with (wistaria) vines. Highly significant it is furthermore that Uzume-no-mikoto herself is afterwards known, and only referred to in mythology, as Saru-me-no-mikotob, the August Monkey- Female, or still later as Saruta-hime-no-mikotoc, the August Monkey-Field Princess. Her thumping antics on the "tub" in the Plain of Heaven, on earth created the so-called sarugakUd, the Monkey-dance, rather comic if no longer indelicate to the point of disrobing, ac- companied by instruments and song, and decidedly at first linked with fertility provoking festivities.9 The descendants of this same female kami were known by the name of Sarume-no-kimie, Monkey-Female Ladies, and their genealogy seems to have been in the feminine line; to them was entrusted the making of sacred 9 The ceremonial sarugaku flourished especially from before the 8th to about the 13th century, when the more stately (if in its origins contemporary) bugaku S took ascendency, to be later in turn replaced by the even more formal nogaku PfM Some of the farmers' ritual summer-dances until recently were, however, quite licentious. The actual figures of the sarugaku-earlier simply called sarumai @ X-are not known; but apparently each performer "danced" according to his or her own inspiration. Beginning with a slow stepping about, the cadence was gradually sped up, and the performers jumped about, twirled, abandoned themselves to disorderly and suggestive contortions, evoking the idea of monkeys making love. a r b - c jEfpr d , e -</page><page sequence="8">20 U. A. Casal music.10 A noticeable fact is also that all Japanese "dances" - of temples, of geisha, the rondos of the farmers and even of the children-are punctuated by rhythmic stamping of the feet. Also, in parts of rural Japan, at the O-Bon festival in summer the song- leader continues to stand on a mortar. When Ninigi-no-mikotoa, the Sun's grandchild, was sent to the earth to take possession of Japan, he was accompanied by a great many gods, some of whom had played a role at the cave incident. His progress, however, was obstructed at a point by an enormous and refulgent monster, the god of the Eight-forked Roads, Saruta-hikob, Prince Monkey-Field. None of the large company of male gods had courage enough to face him: only the saucy wench Uzume was bold enough. "Thou art superior to others in the power of thy looks," said the males; or "Though thou art but a delicate female, thou art a Deity who conquers in facing Deities," She went to meet the giant, "with her waistband lowered below the navel and her breasts laid bare," and greeted him with a mocking grin. But she was informed that he, Saruta- hiko, had only come to offer his services as a guide; whereupon they went off together-"as heralds," "to Ise," and Ninigi-no- mikoto could continue his procession. It is a well known fact that the gods of the road, and especially of the forking roads, are phallic. Saruta's name links him with the Monkey and with the Fields-he is, like most road-gods, a deity of vegetation (fertility) and a deity who prevents illness (epidemics), supposed to come along the roads, like travellers. Both activities imply the "conservation" of the tribe. Illness and disaster could only be avoided by having plentiful crops, which needed fertility. Fertility had to guard the roads, so that the spirits of Evil could not come along them "from abroad". Most roads go in curves and zigzags because the spectres of misfortune prefer to travel in a straight line. Rocks were set up at strategic 10 Later on four families had the practical monopoly of the com- position and execution of sarugaku and no music (the Kanze WEft, Kornparu!6, H6sh gt, and Kong6 6iiU), a real hierarchy in one depart- ment of "religion". They were collectively known as the Sarugaku Shiza %4-,V (Four Companies). The kagura *Z is another ritual dance, per- formed by shrine-girls, said to be derived from the Uzume entertainment. It is a strictly decent pantomimic posturing and walking, but the thump- ing of the feet forms part of it. a *kj' b EEZ</page><page sequence="9">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 21 points, so that the spectres should run against them and come to grief. It may be of some interest to note that at the Inaria shrine in Fushimi (near Kyoto), the most famous one of this deity of the rice, Inari is conjointly worshipped with Uga-no-mitama-no- mikotob, the protecting spirit of the five cereals and of industry, with Omiya-no-me-no-mikotoc, the god.dess who fosters harmony between government and people, and with Saruta-hiko-no- mikoto, god of the roads and (incidentally) of commerce. Emperor Go-Daigod (1219-1338), as recorded on a stone tablet in the shrine precincts, in a poem considered them to be The three deities that give us light To guide our hesitant footsteps Through the dark wilderness of doubt. Through further modifications, Uzume or Sarume in the end also became the popular goddess of luck and jollity, known as O-Tafukue or O-Kamef, and until the police, under an enlightened modern government, prohibited such indecencies, she was con- stantly and conspicuously represented with phallic attributes." As for Saruta-hiko, all along the roads there were innumerable little sheds containing phalli erected in his honour and as a pro- tection against crop-failures, sickness, and lack of progeny. Like other children-granting images, they were offered children's bibs. The same phallic meaning of the word saru, monkey, may be suspected in such names as Sarusawa-no-ikeg (Monkey-marsh pond) at Nara, where undoubtedly of old fertility rituals were performed. Legend tells us that in the days when Nara was the capital (710-784) a beautiful maiden of the Court, wooed by all the young bloods, refused their offers of marriage because she was in love with the emperor. But when her august lover tired of her, she went and drowned herself in the Sarusawa pond. While this may be a historical fact, it at the same time decidedly suggests some ancient fertility-rite sacrifice. There are strong indications that in Japan, as elsewhere, maidens were offered to the water-spirits. There is a river Saruh in Hokkaid6, a locality Saru-ga-ky6i (Monkey-bridge) not far from Maebashi, a Saru- shimai (Monkey-island) in the Bay of Toky6 (known to us as 11 A paper on O-Tafuku by the author was published in Ethnos (1950: 1-2) of the Ethnographical Museum of Sweden, Stockholm. a a p b -j c ;tckr d Rp i e VA,V f MfiE gMNAk h jbDJIj i iy jMA@</page><page sequence="10">22 U. A. Casal Perry Island), and a Saruta-yamaa (Monkey-field Mountain) near Nagasaki, apart from numerous Monkey localities of but communal importance. And on the basis of the general nomencla- ture of Japan I would say that these places were so named because of an occult monkey connection (fertility rites etc.) rather than because some of those creatures lived there.12 A monkey figure whose origin is apparently no longer known, but which to my mind is undoubtedly older than the introduction of the Chinese calendar early in the 7th century, is K6shinb, later representing the day on which the two terms of the cycle Ka-no- ec (Metal elder-brother) and SarUd (Monkey) meet, i.e., the 57th.13 On that day, feasts are held, whose meaning has become obscure but which I consider credibly to have been prophylactic. The god Saruta-hiko is worshipped, and also a star (or star- deity), called K6shin. the day is known as the Monkey-day, and in the country districts offerings are made to upright stones on which three monkeys (sambiki-zarue) are carved. The belief exists that if a person sleeps during the previous night, he will be threatened with various misfortunes. In about the tenth century this fear went so far that people stayed up each night preceeding a cyclical Monkey-day (which comes every two months), playing games "to while away the time"-a typical non- chalance attitude in the face of danger: -as they believed that worms or at least mushil would, those nights, enter the body of any sleeping person. Worms are connected with snake lore, which in turn reverts to Fertility, but also to Death; and mushi is not only an insect of any kind, worm, caterpillar and so forth, but also anything "disagreeable" as well as "bad temper". Much of this custom reminds one of the sickness-preventing rituals. It is said that dolls are offered at Koshin's shrine "in memory of the departed", but very probably these "dolls" are the ancient (if transiormed) nademonog and similar "scapegoats" of the rough outline of humans, to whom illness and ritual pollution were 12 The Saru-bashi MR, Monkey-bridge, which is said to have given its name to a place near K6fu, and which we mainly know from a famous print by Hiroshige, however, was apparently so called because it was such a flimsy, crazy affair between two high cliffs and over a dark emerald stream, that only a monkey could feel secure in venturing across. 13 For the zodiacal Monkey see later. a MRJL b E* c a d * e ERJF f _ g t4</page><page sequence="11">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 23 transferred at certain rituals. K6shin in fact must have been but another ancient god of the roads, modified by Buddhist and Taoist conceptions. Hearn somewhere describes a very ancient statue of K6shin holding in his six hands respectively a monkey, a serpent, a wheel, a sword, a rosary, and a sceptre-all well known "life-and-death" symbols. The prevention of illness, of bad crops, of misfortune of all kinds, forms part of all phallic rites, and the vertical stone with the three monkeys-often at the apex-is undoubtedly of phallic origin. Of the three monkeys, one each is in the attitude of hiding his eyes with his hand "so as not to see" (mi-zarua), stopping his ears "so as not to hear" (kika-zarub), and covering his mouth "so as not to speak" (iwa-zaruc). Such, at least, is the popular interpretation: see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. But the three attitudes tally completely with the idea of evil which may penetrate the body through its (main) orifices, one of the most ancient superstitions in the East. The "mouth covering" could and would include the nostrils.'4 I am of opinion that only much later were the phallic, evil-intercepting monkeys turned into paragons of good behaviour. Stones with the sambiki-zaru are far too numerous along the roadside in the interior of Japan to be explained by the worship of a simian triad which abides by the precept of not noticing (forgiving) malevolence, and not talking injuriously oneself. It is a more rational explanation that the stone phalli (whether natural rocks of approaching outlineorartificially shaped ones), which were still to be seen in great number not so many years ago, were given added "power" against evil influ- ences by this monkey emblem which "prevented evil from enter- ing". Popular views support this theory; the three monkeys are still sometimes considered attendants of D6sojind, the more cur- rent (agricultural) phallic god of the roads ("Road Ancestor") and protector of the wanderer while he traverses demon-infested 14 All through life and even after death the Chinese and Japanese had to be careful to prevent evil from getting into the body through "the nine orifices", of which of course eyes, ears and mouth were the most important, because the most "intelligent" ones. (Certain spectres could also penetrate under the nails.) Special charms were worn, and others used to close the apertures of the corpse. a k}j b ;U c d 1 d BW;</page><page sequence="12">24 U. A. Casal districts'5. Of greatest interest is the fact that D6sojin is also known as the principal Sae-no-kamia, "Preventive Deity", several of whom are other road-gods, including Saruta-hiko. Three is the universal (and also Buddhist) "perfect number"; at the same time it may, and will, refer to the trifurcate road of which Dosojin is particularly the sovereign. It is not the two roads intersecting which are the most sinister "crossroads". They cut each other, and as such have great symbolical meaning, but in their essence they are each one distinct unit, leading into definite directions comparable with the four quarters of the universe. The chimatab, the forked road, is the one which causes doubt, hesitation, confusion. The forked road resembles the stem and main branches of a tree, and also the human body, trunk and two legs. It is "the crotch of the soil", chi-mata. Arriving at this crotch of the soil, one has to take a chance as to right or left, as to whether one will reach the intended place, get lost in an un- known and possibly dangerous spot, or have to retrace one's steps. In many myths the soul of a dead person travels a good distance on a given, straight road; then comes the "parting of the ways", the crotch, at which point Fate or Retribution decides whether he should go right or left (irrespective of the "reasoning" which the soul may follow) and land in Paradise or Hell. Yet the Three can be equally important with the point of intersection of the true crossroads: one knows whence one comes, but there are three problems before one, whither to proceed from this intersection: straight ahead, to the right, or to the left. In both cases (but the first one is the more mystic and more mythical) the three mon- keys correspond to the "three directions" of the road, which may all lead into the Unknown, and from all of which Evil may blow. I do not doubt that the sambiki-zaru were originally specifically emplaced at such forkings.16 15 Exactly the same role was held by Hermes, who was also a phallic god.-The most famous sambiki-zaru are found at Nikk6 and are said to have been carved by Hidari Jingoro 2Yfi:PK, in a wooden panel over the door of a gateway near the god's white pony, which he uses when he wants to go abroad. 16 Of old, phallic stones were commonly erected at crossings or bifurcations. okuni-nushi 1 himself, the Land-possessing Shinto deity, promised to watch over the country's welfare from the "road- windings". an*- b 0</page><page sequence="13">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 25 I deem it highly significant, in view of what we have con- sidered so far, that when the persecuted Christians were impri- soned in what became known as the Kirishitan Yashikia in Edo, a small bridge leading to it, called Gokumon-bashib (prison-gate bridge), was provided with the sculptured image of a monkey, "as a challenge to, or a protection against, the God of the Chris- tians." The bridge was later, and still is, generally called the Kbshin-bashi. The monkey is also the servant or messenger of the "mani- festation", Sanno Gongenc, who is no other than the Shint6 Daikokud, god of crops, in a Ry6bu-Shint6e garb. Daikoku, in turn, is an evolution of Okuni-nushi-no-mikoto, the Great Land Possessor Deity, with a tinge of the Hindu Mahakala, the Big Black One-Fertility as Death. Sann6's temple, also known as Hi-yoshi', the Good Sun Shrine, "on the other side" of Mount Hiei, which protected the old capital Ky6to, was one of the most venerated, even by the Buddhist monks established on Hiei-zan. The altar, as well as the large gates, contains sculptured images of sitting monkeys, which in former days were worshipped. Locally the deity is also known as Oyama-kuig, the Great Mountain Post (or Stake) -which makes him the (phallic) "world-pillar" of Mount Hiei. Sann6 is plainly a guardian god, living on the pro- tective east side of the mountain which, itself on the north-east corner of the plain, the quarter from which most evil spirits come (the kimonh), offered the decisive inducement to select the Kamo Valley for the city of imperial residence."7 A subsidiary Sann6 shrine was one of the first established at Edo by Ota D&amp;kani, long before Tokugawa days. In fact, Sann6 Gongen be- came the protector of Ota's castle-town. Both in Ky6to and Edo the Sanno festivals were highly important and most elaborate. 17 "Should the Mikado take smallpox, the god of Sanno temple was punished by the door being shut for certain days by green bamboo branches placed across the entrance," writes W. G. Dickson in 1889. Smallpox was one of the dreaded pests against which D6sojin, the phallic road-god, was particularly invoked. Green bamboo twigs, for several reasons too involved to be here explained, were amuletic and prophy- lactic, and helped "in getting up again". They are still in constant use at Shint6 festivals. a jPRR b ?qf c jIj3R d ;kJi% e jfin fW g AWj[ h jqr i kfQMM</page><page sequence="14">26 U. A. Casal While Sann6 is now written as Mountain-King (San-O), I do not consider it at all unlikely that this name is but a contrac- tion of an older (pre-calligraphic) name, Saru-no, the Monkey One, or perhaps Saru-no 0, the Monkeys' King.'8 We now come to a rather unexpected aspect of the monkey lore, the animal's connection with the Ocean. Involved as it may seem, it is ultimately a natural one: the monkey is a fertility animal which stands for the multiplication of humans, herds and crops; the sea represents the "collective power" of Water, the element without which no fertility, no Life can be produced, but which also means Death. We have seen that both Hanuman and the Bodhisattva- monkey jump over what we know as the Styx. Hanuman leaps over the "ocean" to the island on which Sita is "hidden", the Island of Death, and finds her so that Rama may conquer Death and bring her back to "eternal life". The Bodhisattva leaps to the "other shore"; to escape from death at the hands of the archers (hunters) he and his monkey-tribe cross the Ganges (Styx) into the "land of salvation". The monkey, Fertility, in both cases is the means to "cheat death". The water, Fertility, in both cases separates the land of the living from the land of the dead (or of eternal life); it is full of dangers (monsters, too short a rope); it in fact "gives death" so that through death "eternal life" may be acquired. This "eternal life" may be applied to the conception of a Paradise as the Buddhists and Christians and Mohammedans know it; originally it certainly meant the eternal continuance of all life of the Cosmos, the ewige Weltkreis which decrees death, and through death creates rebirth. In folklore, the water's place is often taken by fish or shell. We find the first legendary reference to the monkey and water connection in Japanese mythology in the tale of the death of Saruta-hiko-no-mikoto who, near his residence of Azakaa, once went out fishing and had his hand caught by a hirabub shellfish,'9 by which he was dragged beneath the waves so that he died. The shell in question has long ago been identified by Japanese scholars with one of the Arcadae, now called saru-b6-gaic, "monkey-cheek 18 Saruta-hiko himself is often referred to as Sada-biko. 19 The name is no longer explicable, but it must have had some occult meaning. a SEJN b FtA9 c %M</page><page sequence="15">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 27 shell". A queer and interesting name in itself, whatever its relation to the mythologic hirabu. The allegory is possibly a suggestion of floods or tidal waves devastating fields, "drowning" them.20 Saruta-hiko, however, is not resurrected (as fertility deities usually are) and disappears from mythology; but the tale continues by once again introducing Saruta-mea, the former Saru-me (or Uzume), who shortly after the first meeting had become the wife of Saruta-hiko and taken his attribute, ta, the (rice-) field. Right after his death she "drove together all the things broad of fin and the things narrow of fin," and asked them whether they would faithfully serve the Heav- enly Deities (who take care of humanity). This they promised. That probably means that henceforth humanity could rely on the food from the sea as much as on the food from the fields. (The sequence in Japanese mythology is often muddled. They certainly knew sea-food long before they learned agriculture.21) Saruta- me, the Monkey-field Female of Fertility, became also the mis- tress of the Fertility of the Sea. Therefore, ever since this inci- dent, when the "first fruits of the sea" were offered to the emperor a portion was also offered to the Sarume-no-kimib, descendants of Saruta-me. Under Buddhist influence, the minor arts of Japan sometimes represent a monkey as being caught by an enormous bivalve, interpreting the hirabu idea as a warning against Evil which will not let lfoose until it has destroyed us. It is by some obscure nexus with these tales or ideas, no doubt, that the Funadamac. the individual guardian-spirit of a boat, enshrined within the mast's socket-post, intensely dislikes monkeys. Once a person is aboard, he must not even speak the word saru. Should reference to the animal be unavoidable he should use a substitute, such as yama-no hitod, the man of the mountains; the fishermen themselves prefer the word etee, 20 It is interesting to note that old Chinese writers describe a "four-headed monkey" as an omen of a forthcoming flood. "Four" was generally nefarious, but also "'all-embracing". 21 So did Susu-no-o destroy heavenly rice-fields from which the rice then first grew, long before he killed the Food-deity, after which Amaterasu for the first time planted the long and the wide rice-fields and appointed a supervisor over them. a *-k b M*8 c ,S d A4oLD e 14</page><page sequence="16">28 U. A. Casal i"clever". "skilful" (thing).22 While I do not know whether this is general, in Central Japan people thoroughly dislike a comparison with monkeys, which they do not so much consider insulting as bringing mis- fortune. Nor should reference to a saru be made in the morning: hihia or ete should be said instead; but in the port-cities the (English) word monki can be substituted and is understood without causing the least resentment or fear. I have found no satisfactory explanation for this superstition. As so often is the case, the monkey only knows his true name, saru, which is taboo; substitutes he does not understand, wherefore he does not react.23 Saru written ; means "to depart, leave, go away", and it is therefore comprehensible that the word must not be used at a wedding ceremony, as otherwise the bride might soon "run away". For related reasons one should avoid changing house dur- ing a Monkey-year,24 because one is then likely to have to leave it (saru) again before that year comes to an end. This double sense is however not always to be interpreted in a nefarious way; there are votive tablets with a monkey, for instance, intended to make misfortune and evil leave. In other respects the monkey is also more often believed to have good influences, to shield people from evil, to prevent illness, to procure progeny. What- ever it be, there is no danger in referring to the animal if one uses an euphemistic term. In a popular legend, very old but still a favourite with the children, we find another link between the monkey and the sea. The wife of the Dragon-king fell seriously ill, and her physician -the octopus, symbol of life because of its spiralling eight tentacles- prescribed the liver of a live monkey as the only possible cure. (The dragon is the supreme emblem of Water, 22 Such euphemisms-and they are many, both the Funadama or Funanushi j,= (Boat-soul or Boat-possessor) and spirits living in the water being extremely touchy-are known as oki-kotoba J*, "out-at- sea language". 23 Name-taboos are universal. Among the savages it is customary to have a "secret" (and sacred) personal name, which is closely connected with one's soul, life, and to be called by an entirely different appellation, which may from time to time be changed. 24 All years, days and hours are swayed by one of the zodiacal animals. a ?1Ab&gt;</page><page sequence="17">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 29 Rain, Fertility; the "wife" introduces the productive element, bearing rather than impellent; the liver is the seat of the "spirit", or "courage", in this case probably the "will" to bring forth.) The kuragea, or jellyfish, was sent to entice a monkey to come to the dragon-palace, and with honeyed words he succeeded. In those days the kurage had a hard shell and four legs, not so different from a turtle's. On his back the monkey was transported to the Castle-under-the-Ocean, where he was requested to wait a while. Doing so, he overheard the attendants rejoicing with the kurage that a live monkey-liver would soon be available. Although badly frightened, the monkey did not lose his wits, and when the (somewhat stupid) kurage came to ask whether he had a liver, "Yes," he rejoined, "only I don't always carry it with me, and as it happens I left it in a tree to dry, as it had become all wet. But I'll be glad to get it for you." So back they went, and the monkey got off his perch and jumped onto the nearest tree, deriding the kurage for his stupidity.25 The kurage could walk on land but not climb a tree, so in the end he had to plunge back into the brine, to go and report his very sad blunder. Incensed, the Dragon-king had him mercilessly beaten; and that is why his "bones" were crushed to smithereens, and his eyes and mouth so pounded that he cannot use them any more. Ever since, the jellyfish can but float about at the mercy of the waves, the most insipid and useless of all the Dragon-king's subjects. The kurage was a"false" tortoise; the Tortoise is the Support of the World (Vishnu) and is closely allied with the Dragon (Fer- tility) but the "stupid" kurage was unequal to his task and brought his own downfall. The clever, intellectual monkey (Life, Humanity) cheated the credulous, clumsy kurage (the Death- bringer) by climbing into the Tree of Life, even after having been in "Hades". The short visit of the monkey with his liver apparently was, nevertheless, sufficient to help the Dragon-lady, since she is not reported to have died because the medicine was not, in the end, forthcoming. But blundering Death, the kurage, was made innocuous by order of the King of Fertility; yet he was 25 Vishnu is said to have assumea the body of a monkey to acquire the "agility of diplomacy" which he opposed to violence. a ,)</page><page sequence="18">30 U. A. Casal not completely destroyed.25a It is rather remarkable that the monkey should not be more prominently connected with the tree, his natural habitat and, at the same time, one of the most primary and universal emblems of Fertility, of the Sun, of the entire Cosmos, of Life. The monkey in the foregoing tale saves himself in a tree, and the Bodhi- sattva-rmonkey leaped towards, and held fast to a tree on the other shore. Yet while in many monkey presentations there is a background of waves, there is never a significant background of leaves or even of grass.26 Neither lore nor art indicate the tree in a marked way; even in these two legends the "Tree of Life" is seemingly incidental. The nexus is there but faint. In the only other well-known Japanese tale where the tree plays a part, it is rather its fruit. It is the kakia, the Japanese persimmon, of the colour and shape of the Sun, symbol of autumnal Plenty, of Fecundity and a happy family life, of old and sweet age, and what not. In this story of the Monkey and the Crab, the latter is again the rather dull, easily duped creature, but this time a patient, plodding one, unswerving in his purpose. The monkey is wily, ruthless, selfish. But in the end the untiring persistence of the humble crab, helped by others of similar, insignificant station, overcomes the arrogant persecutor.27 In the Saru-kani gassenb, the Monkey and Crab War, both animals are described as exceedingly fond of the persimmon fruit. The monkey once found a persimmon seed, and the crab a rice- dumpling, and the monkey craftily persuaded the crab to ex- change the treasures. So the monkey ate well, but the crab went 25a This, too, seems to be based on a Jdtaka, according to a Chinese version, in which the Dragon-king himself goes to fetch the monkey to get his heart for the sick Dragon-queen. The monkey escapes in the same way, but there is no bone-breaking sequence. "And Buddha told his disciples: 'At that time I was the monkey.'" (See Claus W. Krieg, Chinesische Mythen und Legenden-Der torichte Drache. Zurich 1946.) 26 I exclude, of course, the true to life paintings referred to at the beginning. They are not folkloristic. 27 The tale has, therefore, also been interpreted as a suitable allegory of the oppressed farmer and the overbearing warrior classes of feudal days. aft; b @Xj</page><page sequence="19">Sembiki-zaru, the "thousand monkeys" (iron sword-guard) Gold lacquer inri with bronze and silver inlays Monkeys catching octopi (wood-carved inro)</page><page sequence="20">- Jo o~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~ Vt = 0 CZ &gt; V</page><page sequence="21">Monkey pyramid Performing monkey (ivory) with jingle-stick and Performing hyotioko mask (ivory) monkey (ivory) NETSUKE Monkey-trainer Monkey wondering at bcetle (coloured wood) cx-aw-ling over persimmnon (ivory)</page><page sequence="22">Hanuman's monkeys and the sea-monsters at Lanka (sculpture at Prambanam, Java) Sambiki-zaru of Nikko ...... **.*nvv|=_||||A_ Some forgotten monkey-story (dagger-handle, bronze and gold) Seven zodiacal animals, monkey with peaked cap; the other animals are on back (dagger-handle, engraved silver)</page><page sequence="23">m.. t&lt;/' # ' 4 sc~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- 0)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~o 0 X Q~~ ~~ ~~~~~~~~ 4-$ _ ,0 Q - . . .'. o_ _! . o-4</page><page sequence="24">Monkey and peach Monkey "protecting" calabash (coloured pottery) (ivory) NETSUKE Monkey and deer (wood) Monkey holding catf fi with gourd Monkey and deer (wood) ( vo yI</page><page sequence="25">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 31 hungry, in order that he could plant the seed. Carefully tending the growing stem, after eight years he had a fine, fruit bearing tree. Now the unfortunate thing is that the crab cannot climb into the branches of a tree to pluck the fruit. So the crab requests the monkey to do it, promising a share, and the, monkey goes up. Nasty as he is, however, he eats the ripe persimmons himself, and pelts the crab on the ground with the hard, green ones, which break his shell. The crab slowly recovers (or dies, and his son takes up the revenge) and to punish the monkey combines with a mortar, a wasp, and a chestnut (or an egg), to whom he recounts the bad treatment suffered. He then sends an invitation for tea to the monkey, who comes, and finding his host absent for the moment, makes himself comfortable and lifts the tea-kettle from the fire to pour a cup. In that instant the chestnut (or egg) ensconced in the brazier, explodes and sends the hot ashes into the monkey's face. Badly hurt, and hardly able to see, he runs to the water to cool it, when the wasp stings his eyes, blinding him completely. As he tries to run home, the mortar, who had perched himself on a ledge, jumps down on him and crushes him to death. The story, of which the above is the essence, is full of the Life and Death symbolism. We know already the monkey as a lascivious animal, and also as embodying the (quick but cunning and iniquitous) human mind. He first grasps the dumpling (food, fertility) and leaves the patient crab to provide for the future (planting the seed); but he then again steals the good fruit and destroys the patient if obtuse crab with life's misfortunes (the green fruit). The crab is undoubtedly the persevering, slow Fate, bravely plodding along irrespective of impediments, starting again whenever temporarily checked, and in the end reaching his goal, overcoming the more spectacular Cleverness, or Mind, which at times seems to win the game. Whether he recovers or his son supplants him, the patient, awaiting, in the end destruc- tive Fate goes on. Whatever the obstruction, Fate finds a way out, like the water, with which the crab is connected. The crab is the "harmful aspect" of Water (and as such an antagonist of the snake and the dragon), wherefore the monkey, the Human Mind, may want to destroy him, or at least to trick him. But the "harmful aspect" of the water even prevents the monkey from reaching the "benevolent aspect" of the water to cool his face and make him see again. The crab is relentless Death, out of which,</page><page sequence="26">32 U. A. Casal nevertheless, Life continues.28 The Wasp symbolizes "the sting of life", but also Industry, the constancy, the assiduity in small things which may kill or bring success, according to its nature. Chestnuts are fruits of the gods and bestow immortality; they are connected with the har- yest-moon, and are a distinct "future life" or resurrection emblem. So, of course, is the egg, the "germ" of animal life, as the chestnut is of vegetal life. Sometimes apparently it is necessary that they "die" (explode) so as to prevent greater harm. The mortar is a universal fertility symbol for reasons partly obvious, partly related to other phallic metaphors.29 They are all Life symbols, and they all combine against Life, as represented by the monkey, whom Death attains while he tries to enjoy his tea-while "drain- ing the pleasures of life". The symbolism contained in these two legends (especially in the second one), nowadays meant to amuse children, is of the most ancient and is more ramified than here outlined. For our purpose, however, this survey will do. A last and Taoist-mystic link between the monkey and water- fertility: Pao P'u-tzea, philosopher and alchemist of the 4th century, was convinced that after living for eight hundred to a thousand years, monkeys were metamorphosed into toads. The toad, however, is again credited with life-powers and with "evil" powers: he is one of the Five Poisonous Reptiles; he is "disgust- ing"-and therefore brings luck and riches. He represents the Womb, is a life-creator. He is the producer of rain who lives in the Moon, the abode of the Dead (Immortals). A very complex and very universal figure. Under the circumstances it is not to be wondered at that the monkey was believed to know the past and to have control over witches and hobgoblins, especially also over the evil spirits of sickness. The monkey was first worshipped in China "in return 28 Buddhist legends and Chinese demon-beliefs make the crab a dangerous, goblin-like if valiant being. The souls of Japanese warriors who found their death in the sea may become crabs with an ugly, dis- torted face on the back. They may be harmful to the living, but their shell will also frighten away evil. 29 We saw Uzume, the later Sarume, perform a "mortar-dance" to get Amaterasu out of her hiding cave. a 4i#FT</page><page sequence="27">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 33 for the services rendered to Hsiuan-chuang," it is said, but this is undoubtedly a Buddhist imposition on a much older creed. He was deified as "the Great Sage equal to Heaven", and called "His Excellency, the Holy King". But his main claim to adoration was because he kept away illness, brought progeny (therefore riches), success in official positions (being nimble-minded) -all attain- ments which, more or less closely, have always and everywhere been connected with fertility and phallicism. The monkey's image therefore became a guardian not only of the household-and chiefly of the women's quarters-but particularly also of prosti- tutes, be it to attract numerous and wealthy patrons, be it to guard against venereal diseases. The skin of a monkey, however, became one of the most potent charms as part of the dress.30 In Japan it is mainly at Shint6 shrines that monkey amulets are sold: either in the shape of the see-not, hear-not, speak-not trinity or as a male and female with pup, as a male with absurdly enlarged organ, or as a group of many ("a thousand", sembiki- zarua), holding on to each other, or piling upon each other's shoulder in a pyramid. They are good for procuring progeny to women in some cases, but in most are prophylactic or recuper- ative, and especially valuable also against children's contagious diseases. The idea of a scapegoat is evident at times, as when the talisman is placed next to the child's bed, to be later "sacrificed" (returned to the sanctuary or thrown into the water) and re- placed by a new one. Others are kept on the kamidanab (god- shelf), or in the living-room, or in the clothes-chest, and so forth, or are attached to the sash or carried in one's purse as a more personal talisman. In some way or other they all "drive away evil" and thereby bring happiness. The monkey, irrespective of species, is deemed to be the living representative of Ugliness; and ugliness, like dirt, always means Good Luck of some sort. Because of the evil-dispelling quality, the monkey, in Japan at least, was a constant attendant on horses. Without one of the small, red-faced macaques to ward off infections, no stable of any pretension was deemed to be completely furnished. We 30 It is said that the skin of the golden-brown Rhinopithecus roxel- lanae of Szechuan and Kansu was at one time reserved to members of the Chinese imperial family. a zFJE b "E</page><page sequence="28">34 U. A. Casal evidently have a survival of the monkey-figure as a phallic road- god, protecting the horse that is used for travelling along the roads. The monkey lived in the stable, being free to go about, and at certain days, especially at New Year, when a new span of life began, gave "performances" before the stalls, to the equal delight of grooms and horses.3' Pictures of a monkey riding a horse are therefore frequent, and of course amuletic. Buddhism has taken over the monkey-and-horse combination for its own symbolism, and tethers both to a pillar inscribed shina, "heart". The horse becomes "the restless spirit", fretting, wanting to run around and gambol. The monkey is human "selfishness". Yet both, because of the chains of "true teaching", will become subdued and firmly attached to the cosmic and occult "heart", and some day attain the perfect contentment of Peace (Nirvdna) . In China the monkey frequently accompanies the Deer, the steed of the gods in Chinese as in other mythologies. But the Deer, again is a totemistic animal closely associated with the Sun, with Death (when hunted), therefore with Life, whose essence is said to be contained in its velvety horns. As the monkey knows the past, so can the deer predict the future.32 In combination, therefore, they cover Past and Future, they create and preserve, they represent the gods and humanity, Heaven and Earth; they stand for the Universal Forces-and are a most efficacious amulet. Invertedly, the monkey, as Intellect, rides the deer, the Passivity of Life, and "makes it go". He is the Essence of Activity which makes the Force of Life work for his own benefit; the human- like spirit having power over the less nimble animals of the forest; Cleverness which rides the lub, "deer", that is, can subju- gate or acquire luC, "promotion".33 The monkey simply replaces the immortals and gods whose riding animal the deer originally 31 In Japan the horse faces the entrance to the stall-a more sensible way than ours, where the unseen approach of man or beast from behind may scare it.-The box of the sacred horse at the shrine of Ieyasu at Nikk6 is guarded by three carved monkeys. It was believed that on New Year these images would don the robes of Shint6 priests and render divine honours to the horse. 32 Usually through its shoulder-blades as an oracle. 33 Much Chinese symbolism is entirely based on a play of words, on homonyms. a 4j b M c</page><page sequence="29">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 35 was and of whom Sun Hou-tze felt to be the equal. Similarly, the monkey may be found riding or leading a water-buffalo. The buffalo, the ox and cow, are fertility-animals all over the world, connected with water, with progeny and, as helpers of the farmer in his work, particularly with the growth of cereals. The monkey may therefore be conceived as adding to the buffalo's powers. But the buffalo, again, is the slow, plodding, docile, somewhat dense "beast of burden", tirelessly working in the interest of its owner; the monkey, the agile, nimble-minded if rather erratic "free agent", whose prodding or leading will keep the buffalo at work, is the "master", human- ity, who benefits from the efforts of passive ("stupid") Nature. Two purely phallic combinations are the monkey and the dog, and the monkey and the hare. Of course their representations are again talismanic. The dog, in its essence, although gifted with many other attributes, is a prolific animal, a brave defender of life against the many spectres which lurk in the dark, a friend capable of unearthing hidden treasure for the benefit of man. But it is also a "filthy scavenger" (whence its treasure-finding character, filth and treasure always having one meaning, the same as death and life) and may eat little (or unborn) children, therefore becoming a representative of Death. Sorm-ehow the relationship between monkey and dog is not a friendly one: inu to sarua, dog and monkey, conveys exactly the same idea as our "dog and cat". Is it an actual natural aversion? Did jealousy play its part in the stables, where dogs were also kept? Perhaps both, but I suspect an older and more occult meaning which no longer seems manifest. Very similar to the dog in some respects, if even more com- plex, is the hare. In India, China, Japan it inhabits the Moon, and also walks over the ocean, or nides in the reeds of marshy plains. It is thus a "water-fertility" animal in every sense, and the reeds add a touch of "original creation". The hare is again a symbol of fecundity since it bears many young with ease. It is "the friend of young virgins", as the monkey is the friend of those women who turn love into a profession: the two extremes of sexual activity which have always and everywhere been of the highest significance in fertility worship. The Chinese Hare in the a ;kL</page><page sequence="30">36 U. A. Casal Moon pounds the herbs of immortality in a mortar, thus to extract the elixir of life; in Japan he pounds the rice to make the dump- lings that are as round and white as the moon, or as a mirror, symbol of the Sun. The hare is a crop-spirit, and as such fights mischievous goblins. But, with all these life-creating and life- preserving characteristics, the very fact that he lives in the (cold) Moon-of which he is said to be the essence-makes him a spirit of Death. Monkey and dog, monkey and hare, are thus again represen- tatives of the forces of Life and the forces of Death-the eternal theme of the constant evolution, constant substitution, constant renovation through destruction, of the Universe- with the hope, when in the form of a charm, that the "life-instrumentality" may be preponderant and give fertility. Sun Hou-tze, in one of his pranky exploits, stole a few Peaches of Immortality which Hsi Wang Mua, the Mother-goddess of the West, had laid out for a feast she intended to give to the other immortals. (The West, as elsewhere, in China is the abode of the souls, the direction of Death, therefore of Immortality.) He ate them, of course, and thereby he (the monkey, Humanity, Fertility) became immortal. The peach, like other fruits in other lands, is the Chinese "fruit of life" par excellence, although there are several others. Its lore is extensive, so extensive that it cannot here be gone into. It has been taken over by Japan, especially also as applying to the feminine sex, and it is interesting to see that Uzume-no- mikoto already used the word momo in her Sun-provoking dance- song, full of double meanings. Momo, which in the "decent" rendition of the couplet may mean "a hundred"b, is the word for peachc, and equally for thighsd; and in the less modest inter- pretation of the same song she thereby calls attention to the allurements of her body. An important Life and Death allegory is again found in Japan in the fable of Momotar6e, the "Peach First-born", which can, however, and evidently was intended to, mean "the Thigh-born". The birth from a thigh, or from the hip, or the ribs, is also known elsewhere; it is, I am satisfied, a supernaturalization of the com- mon way of being brought into the world, comparable to the birth from a virgin mother (and sometimes they coincide), because of a FfEf b A c V8 d R e VS;kP</page><page sequence="31">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 37 a taboo. The various incidents of procreation were "unclean", "hidden", with most of the primitive races, an attitude which retains its strong marks with civilized peoples of our day. Thigh or side births are frequently connected with Moon-divinities, who in turn, if females, are generally virgins, while if males, are connected with "the Intoxicant" of the race, which becomes the elixir of life. Both male and female personifications of the Moon are Life-divinities by being Death-divinities; both, also, are usually considered fastidious in matters of purity. Hence the unsullied emergence of a quite mature child from some other part of the divinity's body. Momotar6 stepped out of a peach which had floated down a river and was found by an old and childless couple who cut it open. His youth he spent in the company of various animals of field and forest, all of them with some Life and Death meaning, but which we cannot here consider more closely. Quickly arrived at the age of maturity or manhood (about 15 in the days of yore), Momotar6 decided to set out on the con- quest of the onia, the ogres who lived on a neighboring island, and who with their depredations harassed the country folk. For lunch his adoptive mother gave him some kibi-dangob, round millet-dumplings, and after a good march he sat down to eat them.4 A dog turns up and begs some dumplings, which he receives on condition that he accompany Momotar6. On they march, and a monkey falls in with them. He, too, wants to help in the expedition for the remuneration of a dumpling. The dog objects strenuously, and they start a vociferous contention, which Momotardo decides in favour of the monkey. Then, farther on again, they encounter a pheasant. The dog starts to chase the bird, and Momotar6 promises to save him, and to give him a dumpling, provided he would join the group; otherwise the dog would kill and eat him. So the pheasant as well goes along: the dog marches first, then the boy and the pheasant, while the monkey walks behind, carrying Momotar6's long sword. At last they come to the sea and find a boat in which to cross 34 Millet, much older a cereal than rice, was of great sacrificial im- portance with the Chinese and with the Ainu aborigines of Japan, who, incidentally, distinguished a "male" and a "female" millet; sacrificial "wine" was made from it, only much later replaced by the rice-sake. In Japanese mythology the millet appears but indirectly. a X, b SE</page><page sequence="32">38 U. A. Casal the channel separating them from Onigashimaa, the Devil's Island, where the ogre's castle rises high on huge rocks. The pheasant at once flies over the ramparts to inspect the interior, and, encountering some oni, begins a fight which is rather one- sided. Luckily for him, the monkey climbs over the walls and opens the gate, so that the master and the dog can walk in too. The ogres in the meantime have divided into three parties, and each one is matched and defeated by one of the animals, while Momotar6 himself attacks the chief, who soon capitulates and offers the victor all his treasures, and also his horns, which he breaks off himself. The chief is bound safely, and with a cart heavily loaded the quartet returns home, where the old couple is overjoyed at the success of their darling. Told less bluntly, this makes a charming fairy-tale for little children, and in fact Momotar6 is probably their best-beloved boy hero. His and his attendants' picture may be found in the most unexpected places. But like so many Germanic Mdrchen, the story is full of symbolism which seems to point to a consider- able antiquity of the parable. Momotard himself, Life, comes to save the old couple, decay- ing, perishing Humanity. The three animals help the new Hu- manity, the new Life, because they in turn are given the life- sustaining element represented by the millet-dumplings. The features of the dog as a phallic animal we have shortly con- sidered; interesting is the verbal battle between the dog, who comes first, and the monkey, who has very similar attributes. The "enmity" of the two seems to be old. It is not impossible that in days gone by there were some marked discrepancies in their respective fertility and life affinities, which have been lost since. It looks as if the dog were rather the passive, "cannot be helped" attitude of fertility, as Nature "just happens" to be productive, while the monkey is rather the indiscriminate fertilizer, who makes everything bear. But the dog also suggests the "destructive aspect" of productive fertility (bitches frequently eat their new- born pups, and here he threatens to kill the bird); the monkey again the erratic but "constructive aspect"; the ancients recog- nized that nothing new could be created without a corresponding annihilation of some sort. Most of their Life-divinities thus had their "double" which caused Death, or at least presided over the abode of the Dead (island, mountain, moon). Monkey and dog a A,+r</page><page sequence="33">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 39 may be similar polarities.35 To the dog and the monkey, as prolific life-givers in the physical sense, is adjoined the pheasant, the "soul" (like most birds) and messenger of the (Shint6) gods, the Sun-bird and Fire- bird so valorous that it will fight the Snake of Water (and of Evil). The pheasant, as Thought, Sentiment, is first to penetrate the fortress, but Thought alone is not enough; Intellect is neces- sary; the monkey must arrive to open the door, "to find the way", so that Humanity may enter to conquer, carrying the Sword of Purity, another symbol of the Soul and of Death, but also of Wisdom. And Humanity comes accompanied by the dog, the dog of progeny who, as I said, I doubt is always of inoffensive char- acter: the dog who, in order to create, first destroys. Onigashima is of course the universal Island of the Dead, the other shore which the party, again as everywhere else, can only reach by crossing the "Styx" in a boat-the Boat of Life which floats on (or in) the Cosmos, which always goes to the island but never comes back. (Momotar6 and his fellows, too, do not seem to need it in order to return with their treasure.) The ogres are Death in its various aspects. Life, Humanity, with the help of Fertility in sunidry shapes, overcomes Death, but Death is not extinguished; the "chief" gives in and is bound, but remains alive and, somehow or other, will re-establish his reign. But he has broken off his horns, his "power", as a token of submission. Humanity need not fear Death. On the contrary, Death gives Life to Humanity, "all the treasures", the Saptardtnd of Hinduism, the Seven Mystic Jewels which confer health and wealth, wisdom and power, longevity and posterity, the Shipp6a of Good Fortune which make life enjoyable and death contemptible.36 35 Usually the Hero who slays the Monster can also be identified as the anthropomorphic personification of the zoomorphic "destroyer" which he kills. In the Shint6 myths, Susa-no-o, the god of Storm (and Rain), kills the orochi kr, a fierce Water (and Rain-clouds) "dragon", so as to save the young and last daughter of an old couple, the continued pro- creation of humanity. 36 In a divorce scene between Izanagi and Izanami, the Shint6 creator couple, the "mother" who had already departed for the Nether- world resentfully swears that she would kill a thousand people every day, whereupon the "father" promises to build a thousand and five hundred parturition huts every day. a L-_</page><page sequence="34">40 U. A. Casal Much old knowledge and deep philosophy is embodied in this fairy-tale. And the monkey plays an important role in it. He carries the sword to the battle, the last in line, as covering the rear; and on the return journey he proudly marches at the head, with a banner which boldly proclaims Momotar6's prowess; Nippon-ichia_"First (hero) in Japan", meaning, of course, the world. Humanity is supreme; it subjugates Nature and conquers Death.37 For the same reason that we find the monkey and the pheasant as companions of Momotar6, possibly, we find the monkey and the cock, each one on one of two symbolical goblets, which belong to the "twelve ornaments" of China, probably among the most ancient groups of emblems ornamenting the im- perial robe worn at sacrifices, and on other ritual objects. The actual meaning of the "goblets" seems to have been forgotten, but no doubt they represent sacrificial vessels. Since the cock is a distinct "sun" or "soul" (spiritual) animal, the monkey, as counterpart, would in this case appear to be a "rain" (or water) and "substance" (or body) animal. The goblets were thus possibly intended to contain some life-water which should benefit both body and soul creating all-round fertility, physical and spiritual "life". Possibly, however, there was at first some other nexus between the two animals; the Egyptian Thot, god of the moon (Fertility, but also Death), usually was an Ibis, but at times also dog-headed. The Chinese monkey may therefore be the moon (water, like the Indian hare) opposed to the cock as sun (fire). Both are necessary to humanity and nature. Both create, and both also destroy. Also, "the bird" usually stands for Air, hence Heaven, and some quadruped (here the monkey?) for Matter, hence Earth.38 37 May I refer the folklorist to the very interesting fact that in ancient Rome a patricide was thrown into the sea, sewed up in a sack which also contained a monkey, a dog, a cock and a snake. Cock plus snake may be equated to the pheasant, a bird which like the cock represents the sun, and fights the snake of darkness. (The conflict between bird and snake in turn is universal.) 38 The Twelve Ornaments are, in their regular sequence: On the upper robe: the Sun, with the three-legged Crow in it; the Moon, con- taining the Hare which pounds the herbs of immortality; a group of Stars, which guide the world and dictate one's fate; a sacred Mountain, meaning (probably) Nature (possibly also abode of the gods); an a EJZ-</page><page sequence="35">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 41 These sundry attributes and interpretations naturally made the monkey a general and efficacious amulet against impending evil. An added feature which may have helped in the conception and augmented its importance is that the creature has long arms; because in China as in India, men with abnormally long arms- "reaching below the knees"- were thought to be particularly wise and successful in all their enterprises.39 Like many other things, misfortune comes in cycles; accord- ing to popular superstition, every twelfth year after one has experienced the first great adversity. Therefore such a person will be careful, whenever the twelfth year comes around, to protect himself with the picture of a monkey, or to dedicate one to certain guardian deities. By a play of words, as we noted, saru may be construed in Japanese as "let me avoid misfortune," or "may adversity leave me." Certain Shinto shrines are full of votive monkey-images, and others even have a live animal chained to a T-shaped post in the precincts, which by its constant beneficient influence shall keep distress away from the parish- ioners. It is quite possible-although not evident from mythology and early history-that some rural communities in the Japan of old worshipped the monkey and sacrificed it on occasion-as the Ainu still do with other animals-and that these are the remain- ing and faint traces of such customs. Remarkably enough, the samurai, whose income entirely depended on the fertility of their fiefs, were fond of having their sword-guards, dagger-handles and sundry other small metal ornaments decorated with monkey figures, possibly, how- ever, with the principal idea of the monkey as "life preserver" in the sense which we found in several allegories. Monkey pictures were also hung up in the rooms in the form of scrolls ascending and a descending Dragon, representing Fertility-rain in all its phases; a Pheasant, the valorous Sun-bird. On the lower robe: the two Goblets just referred to; a spray of Pond-weed (rather doubtful symbolism, but probably Water-fertility); flames of Fire, the "warming" Element (but also Purity); grains of Rice, which of course mean Food, Wealth; an Axe, one of the oldest Resurrection emblems; the ideogram Yaff. This last figure looks exactly like the Swiss cross, with the top and bottom lines extended right and left. Its meaning is quite obscure; usually it is believed to represent "clothing", being the front and back halves of a coat, suitably joined. 39 Buddhist divinities, at least in the earlier stages of iconography, were always represented with such unnatural members.</page><page sequence="36">42 U. A. Casal (particularly during a Monkey-year), be it as the "thousand monkeys" crowded into a small surface, as single ones with peach or persimmon fruit, or just as a few at play together. The love of monkeys for their young must have been well enough known to the Japanese, yet does not seem to have made any impression on them. They know no "monkey love", nor is a child ever "a little monkey" in playful affection. The picture of father, mother and baby monkeys is nevertheless bound to sug- gest a happy family, but it does not oCcur frequently. On the other hand another favourite subject was a "chain" of monkeys, the topmost hanging on to the branch of a tree, the others each holding a hand of the companions above and below, while the last one tries to grab the disk of the moon calmly reflected in a pool of water underneath. It is an allegory on the foolishness of man's efforts, even when acting conjointly (as humanity), on the hopelessness of his aspirations, the silliness of his thoughts, the stupidity of his undertakings, at the risk of his life, if he be without guidance. It reverts to the well-known Buddhist pessimistic attitude on the "vanity of all life". For the same reason, in Japanese poetry, also, the cry of the monkey, like the cry of humanity for salvation, is always sad. The monkey in the wilderness of the forest is lost, forlorn, mournful, demands "soul companionship" and finds it wanting. And yet, like humanity too, the ugly monkey is full of pranks, of human frolic, and among the lower classes it was this aspect, rather, which received most attention. The monkey-trainer could always count on a large and grateful audience. During the Toku- gawa times especially, performers of all kinds went from village to village, singly or in small groups, and in the temple-enclosure or near the market-place beat their drums and gongs of all sorts to attract a crowd and make sure that their efforts would not go unremunerated. Acrobats, fortune-tellers, conjurors, buffoons, sword-swallowers, peep-shows and paper-theatres (not so unlike the modern comic strips, if with more gory subjects) were there at the festivals to create jollity, and our monkey with its trainer conspicuous among them. Others would perform at the principal stopping places-towns or large villages along the high- ways-where the daimyo's procession to or from the. metropolis Edo would stay for a while, so that the numerous attendants and bearers of all kinds might get a rest. It was probably for such occasions that monkeys were first trained to act like these very retainers; dressed in corresponding coats, they carried boxes on</page><page sequence="37">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 43 staffs over their shoulders, or staggered about with state- umbrellas and pikes, with lantern-poles and fans, aping the peculiar walk, half "goose-step", half pirouette, which the bearers assumed when entering a city. It is always highly amusing to see oneself drolly imitated. But the imitations sometimes went farther: the monkey became a blustering samurai with a wooden sword, even the great Lord himself, and in clever disguise ridiculed the betters of the spellbound insignia- and burden- carriers, men from the common strata, of course, friends and relatives of the despised farmers and shopkeepers, who had not much love lost for their overbearing masters. Although performers of all kinds, including the greatest actors, were officially held in such contempt as to be classed as "non-humans", hinina, in the census, they and their shows were welcomed by the "small people", and the artists of the ukiyob school constantly depicted them.40 The monkey performances especially gave them splendid opportunities to satirize the doings of the nobility with but a slight masquerading. Toba Soj6c al- ready, in the 13th century, had found a means of escape from the pomposity and ineptitude surrounding him in drawing scrolls of blinking frogs, timid hares, mischievous monkeys. Himself an archbishop of the Buddhist Church, he recognized the inflated mind and blustering acts of his time and caustically reproduced them in his animal caricatures. Seeing how obvious and how many are the resemblances between humans and certain types of animals, these sarcastic Toba-ed (Toba pictures) were continued as a means to express disapproval or ridicule without too much danger of incurring prosecution, and with the ukiyo school of the Tokugawa era became more general and more elaborate than ever.41 40 "Floating world" school; the "realists" we might say, whose genre pictures of everyday life and portraits of actors and courtesans are best known to us through their xylographic prints. 41 In Europe, during the middle ages, fox and geese were chosen to illustrate the monks and their dupes, the common people, while monkeys "admonished" humanity at large. From Aesop to Dr. Doolittle, animals satirically interpreted humanity and its weakness. But centuries before that, Egyptian papyri show whole groups of animals copying human actions, many of them doubtlessly stigmatizing the king and his courtiers and ladies. Disney's animal cartoons are but a more trivial renovation of the same idea, adapted to our own era's average mentality. a fRA b jf: c .ftMIE d q.%J</page><page sequence="38">44 U. A. Casal Partly as imitator of humanity, partly because of its prolific meaning, we often find a monkey in ceremonial dress, with high conical cap and ritual fan, dancing the sambas5a, the "evil dis- pelling" dramatic posturing of an old man, still acted at the beginning of a theatrical performance. Monkeys are represented as riding races or playing martial games like the samurai, if mounted on the back of dogs rather than of horses. They look into mirrors like dolled up young ladies, or toy with the mask of a devil or a human, as if they wondered whether they could take their place in earnest. With huge spectacles on their noses they play at professors and philosophers, or with various tools represent craftsmen puzzled by odd problems, or carrying their young they act and look like the worried and somewhat be- numbed villagers. The fancy of the artist, especially of the netsukeb carver and inr6c lacquerer, was limitless.42 The monkey, as mans parody, naturally shows up his weakest point, be it vanity, temper, perplexity, or silliness. Popularly, however, the monkey, while cunning, is himself shallow-witted; he is "like a woman" whose judgement is often termed onna no saru-jied, a woman 's monkey-wisdom, "clever" at first sight, but in the end, nevertheless, superficial. And therefore the monkey often finds himself in an embarrassing tangle, highly amusing to the spec- tator. "Even a monkey," says the proverb, "sometimes falls from a tree."43 For some such illustration we may see the monkey trying to grasp a slippery catfish (namazue), or to submerge a calabash, both feats which cannot be accomplished, or only for a fleeting moment, and which therefore serve for a number of comparisons in adage and legend. Here again, however, if we were to delve deeper, we would find a complex fertility lore in both instances. To allude only to the salient points, the catfish, like the Vedic tortoise, supports the world, is the vanquished but not always sub- 42 The netsuke, generally carved from wood, bone or ivory, toggles from which depended on a cord the gold lacquer inro (medicine-box), the tobacco-pouch or some similar container, are an immense source of information on the "spirit" of the Japanese during Tokugawa times. Both netsuke and inro are masterpieces of applied art. 43 Saru mo ki kara ochiruR1 hb, A X*. "To show a monkey how to climb a tree" (saru ni kinobori wo oshieru )z4) ) is the Japanese equivalent to our "teach your grandmother to suck an egg." =V -offlyf est nJ.nA</page><page sequence="39">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 45 missive Soul of the Ocean, and the cause of earthquakes; the gourd is a symbol of Growth (multiplication, ramification), or of the Water of Life, of Health, of Power over Evil. Whether as Fer- tility or as Humanity, the monkey sometimes attempts the im- possible, botches his work. A similar thought, quite possibly, underlies the parable of the monkeys already told in one of the Jdtakas: they were charged to water the trees in a park, but in their silly eagerness uprooted each one of them to see how much water it would need. The monkey is the ninth of the twelve Zodiacal Animals. It governs, apart from the Monkey-years, the Monkey-days, and the ninth lunar month of each year, the hour corresponding to our 3 to 5 p.m. approximately, and the direction (or heavenly quar- ter) West-South-West.44 Being "shy and mischievous", its zodiacal influence is the yina (Jap. in) character, the feminine, passive principle, as befits a being that "bears" rather than that "en- genders" reproduction. This contradiction to the monkey's usually distinctive "fecundative" or yangb (Jap. y6) character, the mascu- line, active principle (while hare, dog, water-buffalo etc. are rather "formative animals"), is nothing unusual, since in Chinese cosmogony everthing has two aspects, yang and yin, according to circumstances, whatever its preponderant character may be. Apparently the twelve zodiacal animals are not autochtho- nous in China, but were adopted from some western nation, possibly of Turco-Tatar stock. The reason for their selection can hardly be discerned now, but we may note that all of them have been interpreted as phallic embodiments. People, of course, are influenced by the animal in whose year they are born, and some of them are more desirable than others. Those born in the Monkey-year are believed, by the Japanese, to be vascillating, restless, unreliable, the "jumpy" nature of the monkey. For this reason, probably, they will not succeed in business, or even in household activities. They are also apt to "leave" before they have finished a task. For some similar reason, probably, but which must also have been connected with superstitions regarding clothes, always identifiable with the wearer, Japanese women avoid cutting the material for their kimono on the Monkey-days of the calendar. The belief is that the dress would soon be damaged by burns a a b W;</page><page sequence="40">46 U. A. Casal or rents. On the other hand the Bird-days are auspicious for such work, because the garment will become "as durable as the plumage of a bird." But I am also told that a Horse-day is best. A good many other things should be avoided on the Monkey- day, as one elderly informant said, "because the monkey scratches and throws things at people." I suspect that at the outset some deeper superstitions were at work, but even the Japanese no longer know why some thinigs are strictly taboo, and others auspicious. So much for the "real" monkey and its aspects and signifi- cance in the vast oriental symbolism, or at least as much as can still be gathered. Man's thoughts, all over the world, began with symbolical comparisons. Religion was taught by symbolism, symbolical parables. The forces of Nature, certain events greatly affecting the community (or nation), eminent epochs of progress were retained in the memory of the human group concerned by representative images; some became legendary "heroes" or gods, some became fetishes, and being easily formed in some hard material gradually were extended to serve as a "token" (sym- bolon) or later on as a "reminder" (monumentum). But there were also others, beings created by Nature, which suggested an association of ideas and simply needed to be given the attribute necessary to definitely link them with a given person, force, or event. Thus certain animals became incorporations of certain conceptions, became gods, whether of good or evil. With human progress, symbolism lost much of its pristine appeal; yet it continues even to this day with the highest developed races, if in less direct manner. We have become more abstract. We no longer believe in animals affecting the community's welfare in some mysterious manner, but some we like and some we dislike -not because of their danger-possibilities, form or colour, but because of a subconscious atavism in many cases-and quite a number of them continue to typify various human traits, or such of Nature's forces, whether in. poetical or impulsive speech. The Oriental has continued to live in closer proximity to Nature than the Occidental (on the average), and to him natural phenomena continue to have a greater personal importance. The life of animals therefore to him is still closely linked with the life of humans. Buddhist teachings (based on older Hindu beliefs), in accepting an interchange of souls between humans and animals (metempsychosis, reincarnation and transmigration based on Karma), sustained this attitude, while Christianity, in</page><page sequence="41">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 47 teaching that the animal world has no soul, has weakened the link. But in the Orient, too, long habit has often effaced the oriainal force of the "symbol" and has left behind but a magic "talisman". People no longer know why the monkey should be adored as a fertility-animal in order to dispel adversity, but they "know" that a monkey-charm obtained at a given temple will bring re- lief from sickness. City people have forgotten the god of the roads, D6sojin or Saruta-hiko, since railways, tramcars and automobiles take them from place to place, but the farmer in the more inac- cessible interior continues to worship "the" god along the foot- path crossing the fields, because his grandfather did so and fared well by it. Temple traditions have been modified to suit the times, perhaps, but the votive offerings of monkey-pictures continue "because they bring luck", while superstition in many other ways flourishes as before-because "one never can tell". And monkey allusions retain their old meaning, or acquire new ones, as the case may be, even if people no longer know what a monkey looks like unless they have visited a zoo. Some folkloristic imaginary beings are connected with the monkey through their features, and again we find that the monkey stands for the creative fertility aspect of these creatures. The Japanese Thunder-god, Raitena, is represented as a shaggy oni (devil, imp) of stocky human traits, as long as he sits in the clouds and beats his halo of drums. Even this god may sometimes lose his balance and fall down to earth-when he will look like a monkey or cat, usually a combination of both, in a way, with iron-like claws which may destroy everything within reach. In the second half of the 5th century one was even caught; unfortunately no picture was made of it, and the descriptions of Raiten after his tumble therefore vary. But monkey-features are manifest. The thunder, inducing rain to fall, is of course fertile, if also dangerous because it can kill people. As late as 1153, there appeared a dreadful monster on the roof of the imperial palace, causing serious illness to the sovereign and great distress to all the inhabitants of Ky6to. It "sang" with a voice "at once guttural, loud, and very plaintive," but shrouded itself invisibly in a black cloud. A famous archer, Minamoto no Yorimasab, shot the beast with a charmed arrow; it was found to be a nuec, with the head of a monkey, the body a b f c</page><page sequence="42">48 U. A. Casal and claws of a tiger, the tail of a serpent, and the wings of a giant bird. As an old commentator says, "a rare and peculiar creature," indeed. However, it combines the features of the most important fertility animals. The tiger is the king of the forests and of the mountains, and usually causes aridity; the snake is the prototype of the dragon, producer of rain; the bird is the symbol of the sun, mostly in its benevolent aspect. And "the head" is that of a monkey. Emperor and country must evidently have been worried by some anomalous weather conditions in that year, and later this was combined into a weird legendary emblem. What is explained as "an idealized personification of the orang-outang" is the mythic Shbjba. The orang-outang is not native to China. but occasional specimens may have found their way thither, and their lore come to Japan. China, remarkably enough, does not know the sh6jo, but in Japan he plays an im- portant role as an auspicious personage of jollity, of unworried perpetual dolce far niente, of the constant enjoyment of life. These orang-outangs were said to come across the sea and live on the broad, sandy shores, near some pine-grove. They were baited by the fishermen with sake, which they love, and their blood and fiery red hair were made into a red dye, "greatly appreciated by the Western barbarians." It must be long since this happened, because in art the sh6j6 are always represented as humans, if with puffed red faces and bulbous noses, and overlarge, smiling mouths. They correctly wear the Japanese haorib and hakamac (the ceremonial dress) and white tabid (socks). Their hair, however, is wild and of an intense scarlet. They dance around, holding a fan and a sake-cup or sake-ladle, or they embrace a sake-jar while lying in drunken- dazed contentment. Their origin is lost, although apparently not very old, and their symbolism has become a superficial one of Epicureanism. They are a merry embodiment of the genius of sake. We may well wonder whether the shojo were not a direct importation from much farther west, the original Greek Satyrs, in fact. Before the satyrs became the companions of Pan of the forests and fields, they were distinct "elementary spirits" of mountains and forests, part goat and part monkey. Hesiod des- cribes them as lazy, a cowardly race, loving only pleasure and a b, c t d)</page><page sequence="43">Far Eastern Monkey Lore 49 good provender, lascivious and sensual, spending much time in making music and dancing. They were the faithful followers of Dionysos, who corresponds very much to the Hindu Soma, god of the Moon, of Life, of Death, but principally of the "soma" elixir, which in turn would be the "wine" of Dionysos, the sake of the shojo. Tradition says that the satyrs were originally humans, and "transformed into monkeys" by Hera because they forgot to control the exuberant Dionysos. The shojo, from being simians, became transformed into humans, if odd ones. The rever- sion is of no importance; such mythic mutations are frequent. Both satyrs and sh6jo are fond of drinking orgies, and of both "races" there are no females. The red hair of the shojo may well indicate their western origin. Sake being "the spirit of rice" (and therefore of food), the elixir vitae sought for since humanity began to brew concoctions of all sorts, the shojo undoubtedly at first was conceived as a spirit of fertility. The vicinity of the sea and of the pine-trees supports this assumption. The Monkey has become human in his shape, has received red hair, red being the most forceful yang colour, the colour of the sun and of blood, and as a Man enjoys the fruits of fertility in the form of the life-giving extract, sake.</page></plain_text>
