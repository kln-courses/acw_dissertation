<plain_text><page sequence="1">Charles Sanders Peirce, Giant in American Philosophy JUSTUS BUCHLER home from Harvard in the fall of 1861 William James said "In last year's [class] there is a son of Prof. Peirce, whom I suspect to be a very csmarť fellow with a great deal of character, pretty independ- ent and violent though." The "Prof. Peirce" to whom James referred was Benjamin Peirce, eminent American mathemati- cian; the unusual young man Charles Sanders Peirce, soon to become a lifelong friend and soon to inaugurate what fructified as the most powerful influence in the history of American philosophy. The spectacular facts of Peirce's career have fil- tered into popular intellectual gossip. Who does not know, by this time, that he was the founder of pragmatism (the doctrine which, to quote the late Giovanni Papini, "had from Peirce its name, from James its fame"); that he wrote voluminously but could not get a single philosophical book published in his life- time; that he likewise failed to obtain permanent academic status; that as a person he was much as James describes him; and that as a writer he was by turns brilliant, unconventional, caustic and obscure? The centennial of Peirce's birth is a good time to look back on the philosophical tradition in which he occupies so impor- tant a place. Possibly because of its relative youth our historians have been blind to the strength of this tradition. American philosophical maturity dates from the beginning of the gilded age and is symbolized by the establishment in 1867 of William T. Harris's Journal of Speculative Philosophy. It was to this journal that Peirce in the following year contributed a series of three remarkable articles, certainly the finest piece of philo- 400</page><page sequence="2">Charles Sanders Peirce sophical literature that had yet appeared in the country. Chaun- cey Wright and Francis Ellingwood Abbot, two men who definitely influenced Peirce and whose reputations were greatest in that period, are today more or less unsung} but they will be reckoned with when thoroughgoing histories of American philosophy are written. Wright, Peirce, Abbot and James, together with others of their circle, were the nucleus from which the major body of thought sprang. Wright, whose influ- ence was largely oral in character, passed from the scene in 1875 at an early age and Abbot lost recognition through the unfortunate hostility of Josiah Royce} but Peirce soon made his powers felt and with the magnanimous James as his medium became a dominant force in the formation of the current that developed Royce, Dewey, Santayana and George H. Mead. It is worth emphasizing that this development was a continuous one, not in the sense that the different philosophers played variations on a single set of ideas but in the sense that mutual influences, whether positive or negative, operated to a high degree. Royce, James and Dewey expressed their indebtedness to Peirce on numerous occasions} and Santayana, who perhaps even before his departure from the country in 191 2 did not like to be called an American philosopher, could hardly escape the challenge of 40 years in the American intellectual climate. But if there is a homogeneity that permits us to speak of a tradition there are also striking differences in the philosophical and literary characteristics of its leading members, each of whom represents a distinctive body of opinion. These peculiar- ities of mind and pen invite many interesting comparisons and one in particular is illuminating. Shortly after James published his Principles of Psychology (1891) two anonymous reviews of the book appeared, one in the Nation and the other in the Atlantic Monthly y the authors Peirce and Santayana respec- tively. Santayana, still in his twenties, was placid, tactful, fin- ished, his review well-rounded, as all his writings for the next half century were to be. Peirce was incisive, often insulting, reckless of grammatical propriety, unable to stretch his space 401</page><page sequence="3">The American Scholar beyond the treatment of one or two crucial points, struggling to draw from his examination as many implications as possible. Santayana was serene, Peirce dishevelled - both were quite extraordinary. At the time that Peirce wrote his papers for the Journal of Speculative Philosophy one old intellectual influence was still strong among philosophers in America and elsewhere. It was the influence of Cartesianism. Descartes had often been buried by his successors and politely eulogized as a quaint antique. And no doubt certain fantastic details of his metaphysics were safely dead. But the psychological scheme that he employed, and above all the logic that he prescribed for successful intellectual inquiry, persisted as basic presuppositions even in his severest critics. Man, it was believed, can look in on his own mind and observe his own thoughts precisely as he observes physical objects. In other words the mind can literally behold itself, wit- ness its own processes. Since the mind studies the world of nature the fact that it can directly examine its own thoughts is impor- tant. For these thoughts are the outcome of the study and by inspecting them the mind can determine whether or not they constitute valid knowledge. It can see whether they are clear and distinct and if they are at once know that they are true. To say that the mind examines itself in order to ascertain the truth is merely another way of saying that it accepts as the truth whatever it feels clearly convinced of. In its feeling of convic- tion it cannot be mistaken, for it cannot be misled by a feeling that is direct, simple, intuitive. This introspective method can only be practised by the individual mind. The individual is thus the ultimate judge of what is and what is not the truth. Peirce revolted against this psychologistic point of view and in attacking it revealed its full intellectual and historical sig- nificance. He first pointed out its gross oversimplification: the mind is not something that can be observed in the simple way that we observe a house. He then pointed out the shaky nature of the consequences that follow from it. The individual cannot be the ultimate judge of truth, for if he were, knowledge of the 402</page><page sequence="4">Charles Sanders Peirce truth would be a private possession. If truth were something acquired by the criterion of psychological conviction or satisfac- tion it could never be communicated: one mind cannot experi- ence the degree of conviction experienced by another. And how can that which is incommunicable be called knowledge? A Walt Whitman, listening to the astronomer, is bewildered by the charts, diagrams and symbols, steals out of the lecture room and looks up in perfect silence at the stars. The mass of theo- retical data does not satisfy him; he prefers ineffable contem- plation. But from Peirce's point of view this, however satisfying to the individual, is not by itself knowledge; it is dumb feeling, not different in kind from the experience of an invertebrate animal. It is precisely the charts, the symbols, the diagrams that make a system of scientific inquiry possible. Can we imagine a "science" where individual inquirers make discoveries that re- main private possessions? Knowledge would never progress. Peirce taught that knowledge is a social product, something non-existent apart from the community. By a magnificent series of analyses he demonstrated that even the thought process of the individual mind is a kind of communication with oneself, a dialogue in which the mind assumes two roles. All communica- tion is by means of symbols - that is to say, by means of lan- guage. Consequently all knowledge, if it is to be communicable and public, must be symbolic or linguistic in character. What are the charts and diagrams but a kind of language? More than any philosopher of modern times Peirce empha- sized and revealed the profound moral significance of the scien- tific method. He firmly believed it the only type of theoretical activity that can be said to end in knowledge. It alone is the method of free public inquiry. Mysticism, arbitrary authority and undisciplined speculation are its enemies. Authoritatively imposed dogma crushes freedom, while mysticism, which claims to dispense wholly with language, destroys cooperative inves- tigation. Opposed to the scientific method are all claims that language, symbols or formulae are not adequate to the under- standing of "reality," that they act as screens intervening be- 403</page><page sequence="5">The American Scholar tween the mind and the world or as false substitutes for the original. Such claims represent cravings for a seizure of things which is not knowledge at all; they miss the realization of the social, cumulative character of knowledge. Yet it is these anti- scientific methods that arrogate to themselves absolute certainty in their results. Peirce had nothing but contempt for glib pre- tensions of this sort; he regarded them as far more pernicious than ignorance. A careful study of the manner in which any natural science carries on investigation testifies that absolute certainty can never be attained by it. And since the method used by natural science is the best of methods no other type of inquiry into the nature of things can claim infallibility in its results. Knowledge grows, by leaps, Peirce liked to say, and the inves- tigator who thinks the evidence for any theory or opinion is complete has ceased to be scientific. The scientific spirit is the spirit of self-criticism. Its aim is the highest possible degree of objectivity in inquiry. Accordingly, Peirce would warn, it must remain indifferent to the influence of practical affairs or special ethical attitudes. Those who, contrary to this warning, are most anxious to direct the subject-matter of science in terms of the struggle for social betterment defeat their own ends. Only by preserving its supreme objectivity and its uncompromising critique of evidence can the scientific method emerge as the natural enemy of mass deception, political barbarism and in- tellectual fraud. In more ways than one Peirce was a revolutionary, an oppo- nent of entrenched dogma and smug habits of thought, a dis- coverer of new possibilities in philosophy - yet, paradoxically, a revolutionary without disciples, a man who attracted no more than normal attention in his lifetime and whose work was only gradually assimilated by a small number. The year before the 1868 articles a series in the Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences was equally path-breaking. This time there was no revolt against some previous tradition but rather a quiet articulation of new ideas. Peirce introduced the new science of mathematical logic to American thought, began 404</page><page sequence="6">Charles Sanders Peirce to make historic contributions himself, and presented logical concepts which were to serve as the foundation for a science of his own discovery - the study of the nature and variety of the symbols that man can use. This science lays bare the different kinds of language that make up our apparatus in the pursuit of truth. It shows that the language of mathematics is different from the language of natural science; that the function of cer- tain signs (and by "signs" Peirce understood not only verbal signs but such things as maps and weather vanes) is to point to or indicate that which they denote whereas the function of other signs is to picture or diagram; that linguistic conventions play a considerable part in human inquiry. The potentiality of the researches opened up is immense and in our day we are ex- ploring the ground that Peirce broke. It was largely this critical attention to language and its prob- lems that led Peirce to formulate his pragmatism: the view that all theories, all opinions about fact of any kind, must be capable of being submitted to evidence exactly in the way that scientific theories are. For a long time various philosophers had persisted in the belief that in contradistinction to problems of natural science, which are settled on the basis of evidence secured from an appeal to experience, certain problems con- cerning the nature of things can be settled by pure reflection. Peirce was convinced, along with those philosophers who have been classed under the label of empiricism, that questions of fact can be settled by experiential investigation alone. But he car- ried the analysis of the situation further, suggesting that factual problems allegedly not decidable by experience involve some abuse of language. The terms by which they are expressed are excessively vague or are perhaps utterly meaningless. An objec- tive criterion of intelligibility is necessary. Pragmatism supplies a formula for clarifying problems by exposing important lin- guistic defects and by calling attention to the standards of scien- tific practise. It maintains that every problem is capable of being solved. To say that a problem is intrinsically insolvable is to say that it is a pseudo-problem, for if it is genuine there must be 405</page><page sequence="7">The American Scholar some specifiable way of investigating it, even though the true answer may remain unknown to us for an indefinite time. This Peircean view is very different from that which most people associate with the name "pragmatism." The pragmatism that has found favor with many American literary groups and with writers on education holds (in a rather confused way) that a theory's "usefulness" or "success" consists in its relevancy to "practical" matters. A problem is regarded as significant if it can influence the actual conduct of those who think about it or offer an answer to it. This forgets what Peirce's view does not - that the conduct of men can be influenced by pseudo-problems too and that a problem which affects men emotionally may be logically unintelligible. Under the influence of James, who derived his pragmatism from Peirce but interpreted it more broadly and loosely, a veritable mob of pragmatists arose in this country and in Europe at the turn of the century, and it is they who are in part responsible for the indefinitely broad extension of the original doctrine. Pragmatism, for which Peirce is most widely known, is among the least understood of his contribu- tions. Professional philosophers often speak of a doctrine which holds that the intellect is inadequate, that the emotions and the will have a legitimate place in inquiry. Nothing can be further than such an "anti-intellectualistic" position from the pragma- tism of Peirce, for which the "will to believe" in the absence of evidence one way or another is the poison of research. Peirce conceived his pragmatism to be a doctrine of logic, a rule pre- scribing the standards that theories must meet if they are to be meaningful answers to problems. Pragmatism was a logic of clarification. For the majority of pragmatists, on the other hand, it was everything else and was turned into a doctrine of ethics, of metaphysics, even of politics. So loose and nebulous did it become that Peirce himself did not escape the influence of the haze, and not until 1905 did he try to shake it off by coining a new name, "pragmaticism," for the old conception. Back in 1877 and 1878, a decade after his earliest publi- cations, Peirce had written for the Popular Science Monthly 406</page><page sequence="8">Charles Sanders Peirce a number of articles one of which, the famous "How to Make Our Ideas Clear," is ordinarily regarded as the original state- ment of pragmatism. In England the next year G. Stanley Hall wrote that the series "promises to become one of the most im- portant of American contributions to philosophy." No one who reads the two opening essays for the first time can miss the vivid impression of the writer as one of peculiar force and fertility or the equally vivid impression of the writer thinking as he writes. Peirce thought and wrote ceaselessly in a long war of self-elucidation. He was for the most part his own Socrates, the midwife to his own ideas. When one weighs the extent of his philosophical labor it seems hardly credible that he should have contributed to mathematics, geodesy, astronomy, chemis- try, photometry, meteorology, psychology, philology and his- tory, and was an authority on wines and universities to boot. But after all, he had embarked on the serious study of his favorite subject, logic, at the ripe age of thirteen. Although Peirce preferred to regard himself as primarily a logician and student of methods for arriving at truth it was perhaps his more speculative philosophical work that had the greater influence on men like James and Royce. Here too he struck out, among other things, against a powerful tradition dominating the thought of his time - the mechanical philos- ophy of the late 19th century. In an essay of 1 892 he examined "the common belief that every single fact in the universe is precisely determined by law," and showed that this belief is by no means a necessary presupposition of scientific thinking. Although there is regularity in nature there is no evidence of absolute or complete regularity. That which things have in common, their uniformities of structure and behavior, is due to law; that which is diverse and specific is due to irregu- larity or chance. Mechanical laws govern the general way in which dice move when thrown, but the fact that a given pair of dice turn up seven on a given throw is specific and unique, the result not of law but of chance or "arbitrary determina- tion." Peirce was for many years connected with the United 407</page><page sequence="9">The American Scholar States Coast and Geodetic Survey and had had exhaustive ex- perience in the technique of precise measurement. He knew that if we measure a quantity many times under the same set of conditions the results never turn out exactly the same; and instead of ascribing this fact to errors of observation alone, in the manner of ordinary scientific procedure, he thought it owing to imperfect conformity to law on the part of what is measured. In his theory of absolute chance as a factor in the universe Peirce felt that he explained what the mechanical philosophy could not- the incontestable variety and diversity which the universe everywhere manifests. Seen in this light, life and spontaneity, freedom and novelty are as real attributes of the universe as law. It is easy to understand why James, who deeply respected every word of Peirce, should have been influenced by such a view. But the influence was not quite as Peirce wished it to be. For James a general conclusion was more important than the details by which it was arrived at. For Peirce a general con- clusion meant nothing unless rigidly substantiated by details. James' protest against the "block universe" that excluded spon- taneity, life and novelty was inclined to be based, as he would frankly admit, on emotional, religious or ethical grounds. The close reasoning of Peirce's essay of 1892 was to him so many words. Years later, in A Pluralistic Universe, he compared Peirce with Bergson on the similarity of their views regarding novelty in the universe. Peirce, though aware of James' partial opaqueness to his manner of thinking, felt wounded and wrote to him in 1909: The only thing I have ever striven to do in philosophy has been to analyze sundry concepts with exactitude; and to do this it is necessary to use terms with strict scientific precision. . . . But that being my only claim to consideration, and it being a deeper conviction with me that philosophy is either a science or is balderdash, and that a man who seeks to further science can hardly commit a greater sin than to use the terms of his science without anxious care to use them with strict ac- curacy, it is not very grateful to my feelings to be classed along with a 408</page><page sequence="10">Charles Sanders Peirce Bergson who seems to be doing his prettiest to muddle all distinc- tions· . . .* Peirce did not escape from another 19th-century fashion of thought, evolutionism. But his own conception of cosmic evolution differed from the current Spencerian. He considered the development of the universe to be essentially like the de- velopment of the individual animal. The direction of its growth is toward habit-forming, toward the creation of pat- terns or regularities which are nothing else than the so-called laws of nature. Admittedly the concept that nature has a "tendency'' to take on habits is anthropomorphic and involves the view that the universe is in some sense spiritual in charac- ter. "Matter" is simply mind become overwhelmed, so to speak, with habit. But just as the development of habits in the indi- vidual leaves room for spontaneous action, so does the evolu- tion of the habits or laws of nature. Peirce wrote that in this general idealistic point of view he followed the suggestion of the late 18th- and early 19th-century German philosopher Schelling, and somewhere he characterized his metaphysics as "Schellingism transformed in the light of modern physics. . . ." If we suddenly raise the question, important for contem- porary thought, whether the doctrines of Peirce's metaphysics obey his own pragmatic formula (which aims to discriminate between a theory that amounts to a significant and arguable opinion and one that is no more than a fanciful cluster of words) we meet with a real difficulty. Are these theories capable of being tested by experience? What kinds of fact would we examine in order to obtain evidence for their truth or falsity? Peirce often condemned certain types of metaphysi- cal doctrine as unintelligible and in a statement of later years reminded readers that one of the purposes of his pragmatism was the clarification of metaphysics. He claimed, rather fre- quently, that his own theories can be observationally tested; 1 From a letter printed In Ralph Barton Perry's The Thought ana Character of William James y Boston, 1935. 409</page><page sequence="11">The American Scholar yet nowhere did he specifically outline how this could be done. Certainly it is not easy to say just what evidence we should have to look for to decide whether matter is "effete mind" or whether nature has a "tendency" to take on habits. No doubt it is possible so to define "experience" that it can be said to serve as evidence for theories of this kind (or of any other kind for that matter). But pragmatism does not provide for more than one kind of evidence - that invoked by the theories of natural science. The problem of inconsistency in Peirce is serious if we insist on reconciling all the basic aspects of his system. It becomes much less serious if we accept each of these aspects for what it is worth and reject what in the light of philosophic research we may feel it necessary to reject. To Peirce philosophy was a science and in this he stood strongly opposed to a view that has since been stated by Santa- yana. Santayana conceives a system of philosophy to be a per- sonal work of art which serves, for the philosopher, to unify the various phases of his experience. Each philosopher employs the set of concepts that he finds best fitted to describe the way in which he knows the world and the moral perspective which he has of it. No controversy ought ever to arise among philoso- phers, any more than among poets, provided that the self- expression of each is sincere and that each is innocent of false pretensions. Philosophy thus practised can never conflict with science or with the universal knowledge we call common sense, which understands that men describe the same world differ- ently and with different degrees of felicitousness. This indi- vidualistic idea of the function of philosophy would plainly have repelled Peirce who regarded the concepts of the philoso- pher not as devices for self-expression but as instruments con- tributing to a common intellectual undertaking. Philosophy is one science among others; it has its own abstractions but it cannot set up a rival to the scientific method of cooperative inquiry. Santayana and Peirce interpreted the history of phi- losophy differently. For Santayana the classical philosophers have contributed, in distinct ways, to the enrichment of human 410</page><page sequence="12">Charles Sanders Peirce experience j for Peirce these philosophers have contributed, each with some value, to the progress of human knowledge. Perhaps both are right and both are wrong. We have come to see the day when certain portions of philosophy are being de- veloped scientifically and we may come some day to feel that certain other portions must always represent expressions of the individual's moral and cognitive experience. Twenty-five years after Peirce's death our bird's-eye view of American thought reveals clearly enough that his place in its development has been to supply rather than to propagate ideas. It was the forte of James to quicken the enthusiasm of the general intellectual public by translating ideas into an idiom which it could adopt. Peirce lacked the popular sparkle of James. He lacked the coherence and satisfying completeness of Dewey and he had little of Santayana's imaginative insight or elegance of statement. But in originality and catholicity of achievement, in depth of philosophic analysis, in suggestive- ness, he stands second to none. The best testimony to the re- sources of his mind is the fact that James, Royce and Dewey felt his influence even before they succeeded in fully under- standing him. Sometimes it is said that he was wilfully obscure, presumably because of his frequent assertions that when medi- ocre minds inherit ideas they divest them of precision and license superficiality. A closer inspection of Peirce's writings discloses a passionate desire to be understood, and by as many minds as possible. He knew that his ideas were difficult, that complete understanding of them was not for the frivolous in- tellect. Dewey has called him a philosopher's philosopher. Yet it is doubtful that he will remain that alone. There is an un- mistakably refreshing quality in his writing, and no one who discovers him can fail to find him provocative. Probably his- torians will never allot as much space to him as to James. But theirs will be the fault. Despite a thousand disavowals they will have elevated the humanist at the expense of the scientist; and will have failed to perceive that there are subtler types of influence in the formation of our culture. 411</page></plain_text>
