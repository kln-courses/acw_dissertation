<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dogma Dogma and Mysticism in Early Christianity. Epiphanius of Cyprus Cyprus and the Legacy of Origen. By Jon F. Dechow. Pp.Pp. xii + 584. (Patristic Monograph Series, 13.) Leuven: Peeters/Macon: Mercer University Press, 1988. FB 1200 In his preface to this work (pp. 4-5), Henri Crouzel warns us what we should not read Origen in the light of later writers who</page><page sequence="2">674 REVIEWS hardened and distorted his system or did not have the genius to understand it, nor participate in their 'radical reduction of the pairs of antitheses that characterize the Alexandrian's thought'. The belief that Epiphanius did treat Origen in precisely this way is the justification for a reassessment of the accuracy of the charges of heresy made by him against Origen in Panarion 64. By selecting particular elements in his thought and passing over others, De chow believes, Epiphanius radically distorted Origen's meaning in the interests of his own defence of Nicene orthodoxy; and he directed much of his critique not against Origen himself but against views current in fourth-century monastic Origenism. It is the presence of these Origenist elements alongside more orthodox forms of monasticism which Dechow signals by his frequent references to theological 'pluralism' in fourth-century Christian ity; and it is the monastic spirituality derived from Origen and centred around a 'spiritualized resurrection experience' (p. 18) which he designates as 'mysticism' (pp. 10-11) in opposition to the literalist 'dogma' of Epiphanius. The bulk of the book consists of two main argumentative thrusts intended to establish the accuracy of these conclusions. Monastic sources are discussed on pp. 32-4, 96-107, and 139-240 with a view to proving that Origenism was widespread in fourth-century monasticism and that it did not go into full retreat until the controversies of 399-400. A historical context is thus provided in which the vehemence of Epiphanius' polemic is explicable. A detailed discussion of the charges against Origen follows on pp. 243-390 to show that they misrepresent Origen in the interests of the anti-Origenist polemic which the situation in monasticism demanded. Epiphanius' role in the Origenist controversies after he wrote Panarion 64 in 376 is examined on pp. 391-448, and an epilogue on pp. 449—60 discusses the sixth-century condemnation of Origen briefly. Before this Dechow offers an account of Epiphanius' life (pp. 25-91) which includes a whole chapter (4, pp. 57-91) on his role in the fourth-century schism at Antioch and the Apollinarian controversy. Dechow's account of the theological questions raised by the Apollinarian controversy is not very clear (cf. pp. 72-3); but his aim is simply to show (pp. 81-2; cf. 63, 90) that Epiphanius regarded Apollinarianism and Origenism as the two most significant heresies, in that both 'diminish the reality of Christian salvation', Apollinarianism by denying the full human ity of the incarnate Word, Origenism by denying the truly human (bodily) nature of the resurrection. The final sections of the prologue to the main arguments are devoted to a discussion of Epiphanius' antecedents in earlier criticisms of Origen by Peter of</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 675 Alexandria, Methodius, and especially Eustathius of Antioch (pp. 107-24), and to his account of Origen's life (pp. 125-38), much of which is of course based on hearsay and 'folklore'. Dechow's treatment of monastic sources is, unfortunately, extremely unsatisfactory. The starting point is that Epiphanius' claim (Panarion 64. 4. 1, Dechow p. 142; cf. Ancoratus 82. 3) that Origenism was found in Egypt among 'some very prominent people also known for having taken up the monastic life' must be taken seriously. It is impossible to disagree with the more moder ate conclusions which could follow from this—that Epiphanius' vehement polemic was precisely a reaction against the presence of Origenism in the monastic movement and that Origenism was generally tolerated and regarded as orthodox in Egyptian monasti cism before the controversies of the last years of the century (pp. 96, 104). But Dechow certainly goes further than the evidence warrants when he argues (pp. 149-64) that ten monks mentioned in the Lausiac History (HL) and other sources as important figures in Nitria were all among the 'prominent people' of Epiphanius. There is nothing whatsoever in the available sources about Amoun of Nitria, Pambo, or Macarius of Alexandria (none of them likely to have been educated figures) to suggest that they were believed to have been Origenists, let alone that they instigated the Origenist tradition which came to prominence in Didymus (pp. 159-61), Isidore (pp. 161-4) and the Tall Brothers (pp. 164-9). On Ρ· 158 the words of Benjamin (HL 12.2) are taken to imply a doctrine of άπάθεια, and therefore that he too was an Origenist; but all he has asserted is that bodily wellbeing and suffering should not affect the 'inner man'—a commonplace of ascetical theology. Similarly on p. 155 Macarius' self-castigation, 'You white haired glutton, how long shall I be with you?' (HL 18. 26) is over-interpreted as suggesting 'the self-abstractive tendencies of the more accom plished ascetics [which] indicate acceptance of a mystical [Origen ist] cosmology in which the corporeal world is subservient to the spiritual'. In fact the alleged evidence for Origenism in these cases amounts only to two forms of guilt by association, both based on false assumptions: that anyone who taught a known Origenist must himself have been an Origenist, and that the Evagrian Origenists, Palladius and Rufinus, would not have mentioned anyone who was not an Origenist like them. On this implicit assumption Rufinus Apology 2. 12 (PL 21, 595a) is cited repeat edly as if all the monks it mentions must have been Origenists. Next (pp. 171-7) Macarius the Great of Scetis and his successor Paphnutius are considered. The only evidence cited for the Origenism of Macarius (apart from Rufinus' reference to him) is</page><page sequence="4">676 REVIEWS from the Macarian homilies, which are used on pp. 308—9, 351 as evidence for Origenist beliefs about the image of God and the resurrection (another reference on p. 299, intimating that the homilies teach the pre-existence of souls, is certainly mistaken). I am willing to keep an open mind on the question of Origenist influence on the homilies, but they should not be used as evidence for conditions in Egypt without a serious reconsideration of the positive positive evidence for their origin in Syria or Asia Minor, and this Dechow does not attempt. In the case of Paphnutius, we have the testimony of Cassian (Conferences 10. 2) that he alone of the leaders of the monasteries in Scetis accepted Theophilus' festal letter of 399 against anthropomorphism. The significance of this depends, however, on further assumptions about the events of 399: it cannot be assumed that all monks were either crude anthropomorphites or sophisticated Origenists. Dechow is embar rassed by HL 47. 3 which speaks of Paphnutius' gift of under standing scripture, 'without having read any [other] writings' (μή άναγνούς γραφάς), and suggests that this must be reinterpreted as 'without consulting the text' (i.e. from memory). But Palladius' reference to this as a prophetic gift belies the reinterpretation, which is in any case a very slim foundation on which to build up a picture of Paphnutius as a learned Origenist. When we come to Evagrius (pp. 177—81) there is a more serious error. Dechow believes that Jerome Ep. 133. 3. 6—7 refers to a lost history, by Evagrius, of the Origenist monks, and suggests that this was a source of the extant Historia Monachorum in Aegypto and HL. Jerome's reference to the inclusion of 'multos . . . qui numquam [monachi] fuerunt' in Evagrius' work is then taken as evidence that the extant texts may have been expurgated of material referring to other eminent Origenists. This would be a precarious argument even if the starting point were correct, but in fact it is wrong. Jerome's letter (CSEL 56. 246) speaks of Eva grius' works on απάθεια which were translated by 'discipulo eius Rufino . . . qui librum quoque scripsit quasi de monachis. . .'. This, as the immediately following comments on Rufinus confirm, shows that Rufinus, not Evagrius, is the author of the alleged history, which is therefore most simply taken as none other than the Latin text of the Historia Monachorum itself. (Dechow's misreading of the text was anticipated by the annotator of the NPNFNPNF version of Jerome's letters. The 'many who were never monks' I take as sarcastic: the Origenists were not really monks, in Jerome's view). When Dechow turns to Upper Egypt his method is similar. The attempt (pp. 190-6) to show that particular Upper Egyptian</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 677 monks such as John of Lycopolis were Origenists is perhaps more successful than in the case of Nitrians such as Pambo, since these Upper Egyptians are known exclusively from HL and the Historia Monachorum,Monachorum, where Evagrian teachings are clearly attributed to them. But it is with the Pachomian monastic movement that Dechow is mainly concerned. He begins (pp. 184-90) with an account of the historical contacts between Nitrian and Pachomian monasticism which proves that the two were by no means com pletely isolated from one-another, but in itself demonstrates nothing about the doctrinal views of the Pachomian monks. Next he repeats the incorrect assertion, made already on pp. 102-3 (an(i cf. 190-1), that Sozomen HE 3. 14. 4 actually describes Pachom ius as an Origenist. Pages 196-206 are taken up with some suggested parallels between the spirituality of Pachomius and his associates and Origenism. Not all of the connections are negligible. Dechow suggests (pp. 204-5) that the account of the resurrection in Letter of Ammon 26 is not incompatible with Origen's view—which is, I agree, at least as likely as the view which sees it as a post-400 addition to the Pachomian tradition (cf. p. 101). Earlier (p. 102) however, Dechow is on weaker ground when he points out that the First Greek Life (Gi), 56-7 teaches that the resurrection is already evident in the present life of the believer, if by this he intends to imply that the passage does not also teach a bodily resurrection to come. Similarly, Paraleipomena 20 makes no reference to the transmigration of souls (as claimed on p. 198), but to the re-use of bodies (i.e. of the material of which they are made) by others. The suggestion that this passage is dependent on PanarionPanarion 64. 70. 5-17 is also probably to be rejected. It is true (pp. 198-9) that Pachomius's view of the image of God in man is not crudely anthropomorphite, but the evidence is surely too slight to judge whether the vitae have subsequently been revised in an anti-Origenist direction; we must, again, beware of thinking that it was not possible to hold a middle position and to deny (as Epiphanius himself did—pp. 311-12, 396) both that the image of God is purely intellectual (found exclusively in the human νοΰς) and that God has a corporeal nature. On the possibility of anti-Origenist accretions to the Pachomian tradition however, Dechow has already (pp. 33-4, 104, 199) stated his view that Pachomius himself is unlikely to have been as anti Origenist as Gi 31 suggests. Rather, he argues on pp. 220-9, this chapter of the life is dependent on Panarion 64. Caution is clearly required here, but I suggest that the general arguments martialled against the authenticity of the anti-Origenist texts do not add up to much, and that the evidence for literary parallels between Epi</page><page sequence="6">678 REVIEWS phanius and the Pachomian sources is very limited. Of the eight phrases into which Dechow divides the first sentence of Gi 31, only one, 'the ruination of the ignorant', is clearly verbally parallel to any thing in Panarion 64 ('you deceive the ignorant': 64. 67. 1). Pacho mian specialists such as Armand Veilleux have of course rejected Gi Gi Gi 31 as non-Pachomian. But I still do not think it is inconceivable that Pachomius might have been persuaded to condemn Origen who was, after all, already a figure of controversy in the early fourth century. And even if Gi 31 is dependent on Epiphanius literarily, the reliability of the historical tradition still cannot be denied a priori. Finally, none of this can supply any positive evidence that Pachomius was actually an Origenist: he may have been completely ignorant of the issues, as other commentators have argued. Dechow's unfortunate relationship with his monastic sources may be illustrated by two or three further examples of relevance to the interpretation of monastic spirituality. The notion (p. 203) that for Egyptian monks άναχώρησις means 'heavenly ascent' rather than withdrawal or renunciation of the world is one. On p. 226 he suggests that the idea of despising (καταφρονεΐν) one's own life or soul (Gi 74, 103, 132) parallels Origen's 'rashness against his own life' (Gi 31), and is therefore a euphemism for 'initiatives deemed abnormal for controlling the sexual desire', i.e. for self-castration. But the three chapters of Gi make no reference to sexual problems: damaging one's own life or soul is clearly a purely general term for negligence in the monastic life. Lastly, there is Dechow's account of the Origenist interpreta tion of Gen. 3: 21. On pp. 315-30 he argues that Origen's discus sion of the view that 'garments of skins' refers to human bodies is more subtle than a simple two-stage account stressing human incorporeality before the fall and confinement in gross material bodies afterwards. As Caroline Bammel shows in her contribution to The Making of Orthodoxy (ed. Rowan Williams, Cambridge, 1989), this view has much to commend it. It is in his detection of a monastic context for Epiphanius' distortion of Origen that De chow goes badly wrong: In line with Origen and Didymus' interpretation of Genesis 3: 21, many monks seem to have associated their garments of animal skin with what the Macarian corpus calls the 'good garment of the body'. At a high stage of accomplishment in asceticism, i.e., at the point where the animal passions have been subdued and passionlessness reached, the monk may shed the skin and, fully self-controlled, go naked both psychologically and literally (p. 331). The first sentence of this astonishing comment is supported by no evidence whatsoever—certainly not by pseudo-Macarius (Collec</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS 679 tion I, homily 49, GCS 55. 2, p. 109), nor by Pachomius' use of a hair shirt (p. 332; see Lefort, Les Vies Coptes de Saint Pachome, PP· 57 &gt; 712־). which merely illustrates his desire for bodily mortification. The second sentence refers to Rufinus' description {PL{PL 21.444B-C) of the monks of Cellia as living 'depositis indumentis' (translated already on p. 148 as 'with skins shed'), while the reference to απάθεια comes from Evagrius' account of the monastic habit in Prakitkos, prologue 6. Evagrius however does not say that the habit symbolizes the body, or that it can be 'shed'; and while Rufinus' phrase is certainly a striking one, in view of the total absence of support for Dechow's interpretation the translation 'stripped of wordly things' (Ward and Russell, The Lives Lives of the Desert Fathers, p. 148) seems perfectly reasonable. How little evidence there is for Dechow's view can be seen from pp. 199-201, where the description of the monastic habit of the Pachomians in HL 32. 3 is also taken as a sign that the Pachomians had connections with Nitrian Origenists and interpreted their garments symbolically with reference to Gen. 3: 21. Needless to say the text of HL provides no support for this symbolic func tion—it is a straightforward account of the monastic tunic (λεβιτ ών), sheep (or goat) skin cloak (μηλωτή), belt (ζώνη), and hood (κουκούλιον). Dechow confuses the goatskin with the belt in the interests of his attempt to align it with the skin belts worn by Elijah and John the Baptist (which would make the connexion with the skins of Gen. 3: 21 less indirect, cf. p. 331), and then associates the 'worked' (είργασμένη) μηλωτή of HL with Origen's statement that God does not act like a tanner ('ίνα βυρσεύσας . . . έργάσηται) in making bodies for Adam and Eve (quoted by Epiphanius, Ancoratus 62. 3). In short, the conclusion drawn with such confidence (pp. 200-1), that the Origenist monks saw the habit as a symbol of their material bodies and practised a 'disci pline' associated with this symbolism, rests on a single verbal parallel (unconnected in actual content) between the works of Origen and a monastic source. Dechow winds up his discussion of this issue with a reference to Panarion 64. 4. 9, saying that Epiphanius 'laughed at those who took such discipline seriously' and 'attacks Origen for feeding the imagination of the monks' (p. 332). Epiphanius certainly regarded Origen's interpretation of Gen. 3: 21 as laughable; but he makes no reference to any monas tic discipline alleged to follow from it. These criticisms of Dechow are, once more, not intended to claim that there were no monastic Origenists in fourth-century Egypt. 'Pluralism' in a wider sense—the presence of gnostic and Manichaean groups and influences—is also well attested</page><page sequence="8">680 REVIEWS (pp. 206-18, 230-40), though Dechow avoids detailed discussion of the significance of the use of the Nag Hammadi texts by the Pachomian monastery at Chenoboskion or of the influence (in my view very peripheral) of gnostic dualism on monastic beliefs. Some of the errors which have been illustrated may therefore seem trivial. But Dechow's ingenuity is continually misplaced in juxta posing unconnected texts and ideas and in detecting traces of supposed Origenism. His unwarranted assumptions, mistakes and misinterpretations frequently lead to simple travesty of the histori cal information and spiritual teaching contained in the monastic sources which he considers, and are not, unfortunately, calculated to instil confidence in his analysis when, half way through the book, he begins his detailed account of Origen's own thought in relation to the charges made against him by Epiphanius. These charges are of course extremely important, and, to be sure, Dechow's treatment of them is illuminating, even though his lack of clarity and his unwillingness to argue critical questions (such, notably, as the reliability of Rufinus' translations) at any length preclude total satisfaction. Is Origen's Trinitarianism rightly treated as an anticipation of some of Arius' claims? (pp. 273-95). Did he teach that the fall led to the loss of the image of God? (pp. 302-15). Above all, did he deny the resurrection of the whole human person, including the material body? (pp. 349-90). Dechow rightly points out the slender nature of the evidence that Origen referred to the Son and Holy Spirit as κτίσματα. De Principiis Prologue 4 and i. 3. 3, and Commentary on John John ii. χ ο (6) are the key to his view. These show that there is a sense in which creation language may be used of the Son (Prov. 8: 22) and of the Spirit (John 1: 3), but also that Origen was cautious about defining the relationship of the persons of the Trinity exclusively in these terms. It is self-evident that Epiphan ius' post-Arian and post-Nicene view would lead him to the conclusion that the fluidity of Origen's language was unsatis factory (pp. 278, 294). The charge that according to Origen fallen humanity no longer possesses the image is, in Dechow's view, simply mistaken, an exaggeration inherited from Methodius (p. 307) and an illegiti mate inference from De Principiis iii. 6. 1 and elsewhere. On the question of the pre-existence of souls (pp. 297-302), as on that of the 'garments of skin', he takes the different line that these were perfectly acceptable Christian speculations and that Epiphanius was unjustified, in the fourth century as he would have been in the third, in condemning them as heretical. In dealing with Origen's view of the resurrection he follows Crouzel (pp. 353, 377, 381—2)</page><page sequence="9">REVIEWS 681 in highlighting the significance of Origen's distinction of the form of the body from its material substrate. This allows Origen to argue for the identity of the resurrection body with 'this body', but not with 'xhis flesh'. Dechow shows conclusively but unsurprisin gly that Epiphanius was completely unsympathetic to this distinc tion. But why did Origen's positions provoke such misgivings any way? Dechow falls back on the 'monastic occasion' (pp. 270, 350) which is held to have given rise to Epiphanius' work, assuming that he has proved sufficiently that a radical Origenism, already moving away from the varied speculations of the master in the direction of a more heterodox approach to doctrines like pre existence, the image of God, and the resurrection, was widespread. Unfortunately this is not adequate. Not only is the evidence for the Origenism of Pambo, Pachomius, and the like illusory, but Dechow treats it as a substitute for serious discussion of the teaching of actual Origenists, notably Evagrius. He contents himself with repeated generalizations (pp. 243, 267, 270, 298, 311, 313-14, 350, 388-9) about the threat to Epiphanius' position posed by the Origenist quest for απάθεια and spiritual resurrec tion. What in detail the Origenist view is we never learn. Epiphan ius himself is only once (p. 301) credited with a positive attempt to defend the 'distinctiveness of Christian doctrine': apart from that his view is simply 'intransigence' (pp. 96, 105-7). The Origenists by contrast are 'sensitive spirits' (p. 181). Even where Evagrius himself is referred to, however (pp. 197, 310, 334, 350), he is hardly allowed to speak for himself but is robbed of all originality and treated only as the mouthpiece of stereotyped positions alleged to be characteristic of Origenist monasticism in general. According to Lloyd Paterson (Studia Patristica 17, p. 938), it is not 'particularly useful merely to say, defensively in Origen's favour, that he was largely misunderstood, which he certainly was, or that with notable exceptions like the Cappadocians his succes sors were lesser minds, which they surely were'. Dechow's book is not an answer to this challenge to Origen studies. If the treatment of Origen himself had been better organized and welded into a coherent account of his Τrinitarianism and anthropology; if Epi phanius' critique had been viewed positively in terms of its scriptural basis and its place in the developing orthodoxy of the post-Nicene period; above all if the two chapters on monastic Origenism had been replaced en bloc with a study of Evagrius in his own right, elucidating both his relationship to Origen and the context of his thought too in the Nicene Church, and enquiring into his dependence on and differences from the non-Origenist</page><page sequence="10">682 REVIEWS monastic tradition (represented by the Apophthegmata Patrum, which Dechow almost completely ignores), Dechow's book would have been at once more interesting, more useful and more convincing. It is in the end its lack of sensitivity to the spirituality of the monastic movement which makes this a disappointing book. Graham Gould Graham Gould</page></plain_text>
