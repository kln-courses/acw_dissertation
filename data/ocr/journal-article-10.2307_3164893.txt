<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS centered on these concerns and their results. Orr shows his own biases by not paying sufficient attention in his lifework to the authentic evangelical qualities of the Desert Fathers, later Celtic and Benedictine monasticism, the Cluniacs, the Franciscans, the Baptist movement in Russia, the Puritan movement and the Reformation itself, and even Wesleyanism. Also, he does not deal adequately with the evangelical spirit inherent in the Oxford movement and in post-Vatican II Roman Catholicism. The author, more- over, tries to be fair about non-Calvinistic revivalism (Finney's, for instance), but his own Calvinism makes that attempt difficult. Finally, Orr tends to view evangelical awakenings, established largely through prayer, as the one source of all that is good in the life of the modern church. Nevertheless, his positive treatment of charismatic renewal in Latin America (in Evangelical Awakenings in Latin America, 1978), though brief, indicates a broadening perspective on the nature of religious awakenings. Despite Orr's biases, which are shared by many modern evangelical scholars, his scholarship is excellent. It is based on good historical sources and is well-researched and well-written, though much of this material can hardly be termed exciting reading. Given the increasing interest in evangeli- cal Christianity among academics, these volumes should appear in all research libraries with major religion collections and should be utilized by all scholars of Christian renewal in general and revivalism in particular. The answers Orr offers and the questions raised by his work are extremely important for the study of the modern church. Nevada City, California RICHARD QUEBEDEAUX Chariot of Fire: Religion and the Beecher Family. By MARIE CASKEY. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1978. xiv + 442 pp. $25.00. The Reverend Dr. Leonard Bacon, the New Haven minister who preached at Lyman Beecher's funeral, remarked in the 1850s that "This country is inhabited by saints, sinners and Beechers." That this remark became a commonplace jest is testimony to Beecher visibility. To a greater degree than the Mathers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries or the Niebuhrs in the twentieth century, the Beecher clan was the first family of nineteenth-century American religion and culture. Marie Caskey's impressive book is the first major study of any of the Beechers to be published since Kathryn Sklar's work on Catherine Beecher in 1973. Chariot of Fire focuses upon the religious experience of Lyman Beecher and his eleven children. Ms. Caskey obviously is steeped in the Beecher source material from which she selects judiciously. The result is a volume which is both comprehensive and reasonably compact. The author finds that the Beechers' religious thought falls into three 215</page><page sequence="2">CHURCH HISTORY distinct patterns which suggest the following categories: (1) the moralists (Catherine Beecher and Isabella Beecher Hooker); (2) the prophets (Edward Beecher and Charles Beecher); and (3) the Christocentric liberals (Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry Ward Beecher, and Thomas Kennicut Beecher). These designations prove adequate to the individual variations of the common family theology and thus provide a helpful framework for under- standing the divergences as well as the continuities in the Beechers' religious experience and thought. The author demonstrates that the matrix for Beecher religious experience was the evangelical household; the inherited theological context from which these variations in Beecher religious thought developed was Lyman Beecher's version of Timothy Dwight's New Haven Theology. Caskey's chapter on spiritualism, describing its attraction for the Beechers and for others in late nineteenth-century American culture, is illuminating. Her final chapter is an examination of the Beechers' doctrine of God and human nature under the following categories: (1) theodicy, (2) election and reprobation, (3) the ethical character of divine law, (4) anthropomorphism, and (5) the divine and human roles in salvation. Ms. Caskey's writing is orderly and lucid. Her documentation is both accurate and exhaustive with extensive endnotes. A seventeen-page bibliog- raphy of both primary and secondary sources adds to the study's value. Carefully edited with an index which is accurate and adequate, this book is a milestone in Beecher studies. Florida State University LEO SANDON, JR. Tallahassee, Florida Octavius Brooks Frothingham, Gentle Radical. By J. WADE CARUTHERS. University, Alabama: University of Alabama Press, 1977. ix + 279 pp. $15.00. Octavius Brooks Frothingham, a moving spirit of the Free Religious Association and interpreter of the Unitarian and Transcendentalist move- ments in America, is a figure eminently deserving of the biography which Professor Caruthers has now provided. The history of liberal religion after the Transcendentalist "heresy" has only recently begun to receive serious attention, and the rise and decline of the FRA has frequently been overlooked in surveys of the American religious experience. Frothingham himself was the author of at least two works, Transcendentalism in New England and Boston Unitarianism, which are still minor classics, and deserve to stay in print. Caruthers' biography of Frothingham succeeds in compiling a great deal of information about the career of a man whose personal life is somewhat difficult to gain access to by the historian. It is also successful in summarizing 216</page></plain_text>
