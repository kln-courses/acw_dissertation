Une lecture attentive du rite de Transmission (bodu ke chuandu ke 4), au c&amp;ur du rituel d'ordination (zouzhi jiacò révèle que le lien contractuel entre l'ordinand et une divinité spécifique du Tonnerre est constitutive de ce que signifie être un taoïste (daoguan MIT, daozhang 5Í-Ü) dans cette région. En plus du pacte de sang établi avec l'un des maîtres chargé de la transmission - un prérequis pour que l'ordinand puisse rece- voir les textes et les instruments liturgiques nécessaires à l'accomplissement de rituels - l'impétrant doit aussi conclure un pacte du même genre avec un général du Tonnerre. Dans le lignage particulier présenté ici, l'ordinand se lie lui-même au Seigneur céleste Yin Jiao chef de divinités du Tonnerre qui lui procurent la puissance efficace dont il aura besoin pour accomplir tout rituel. Pour les taoïstes de ce lignage, un contrat avec Yin Jiao est une condition sine qua non pour pouvoir entrer dans le lignage. La relation de proximité avec Yin Jiao est spatialement représentée par l'installa- tion des divinités du Tonnerre dans le nouvel autel du Tonnerre (leitan Ififi) du taoïste, et textuellement exprimée dans le certificat d'ordination qui atteste de l'identité du taoïste dans cette vie et dans la prochaine. En grande partie, c'est par la vertu de cette relation rituelle, établie lors de la cérémonie d'ordination, que l'impétrant peut être considéré comme un taoïste à part entière par sa communauté et par les puissances célestes. One of the most intriguing aspects of the liturgical life encountered by the scholars working in central Hunan is the pronounced appearance of thunder ritual. Rising to prominence in the Northern Song dynasty, thunder ritual (leifa Wi) is a generic term for a broad spectrum of therapeutic ritual methods associated with the exorcistic power of primordial thunder and imagined to be wielded by a host of martial deities.1 Thunder ritual has become deeply woven into the fabric of Daoist i.

These generals each command legions of spirit armies charged with intimi- dating or destroying demons that cause illness and economic misfortune. The band of martial deities associated with the primal power of thunder is imagined as providing apotropaic protection and exorcistic efficacy. The ritual programs of any jiao or "minor rite" (xiaofa /J';£) - two-to-three hour ritual programs designed to protect or rid households from demonic influences - are infused with invocations, movements, talismans, and spells by which officiants of Daoist ritual summon and come to command thunder generals and their minions. Thunder deities are typically pressed into service to protect the perimeter of the altar space during its purification, to guard transmissions of written announcements and petitions from Daoist officiants to the celestial bureaux of high deities of the pantheon, and, of course, to protect or heal from demonic influence that might inflict the community or patrons of th t jiao or minor rite. From 2004, 1 have spent a good deal of time exploring liturgical activity around Meicheng Township fSMIÄ, located in southeastern Anhua County north- central Hunan.

To make matters more complicated, many Daoist lineages in Meicheng, but not all, are also ordained as officiants of the local exorcistic and divinatory tradition known as the Tradition of the Primal Emperor (yuanhuang jiao ft Mffc).

The very definition of a Daoist priest, literally an "official of the Dao" (daoguan MW), is a ritual officiant who has mastered the proper techniques to summon and control specific thunder deities. Nowhere is this self-definition more plainly visible than in ordination rites, in which these ritual methods are ceremoniously passed down from master to disciple in the form of written manuals of esoteric ritual instructions ( mizhi and oral teachings (kouchuan U{Ķ). In this essay, I employ both textual and ethnographic modes of analysis to bring to light an aspect of these living thunder rites by studying an ordination rite performed by one of the lineages of Daoists who operate in the Meicheng region. By means of a close reading of a transmission rite practiced by them, I demonstrate that a covenantal relationship between an ordinand - a disciple undergoing ordina- tion process - and specific thunder deities is an essential idea that runs through the concept of ordination for local Daoists. Simply put, to become a Daoist in the Meicheng region means not only that an ordinand has received a set of canonical texts that script the rituals he will be qualified to perform, and not only that he has sworn an oath to his master to uphold the rites and teachings that are bequeathed upon him in the form of those texts and oral knowledge. In Meicheng, to become a Daoist means equally that an ordinand has concluded a covenant with one or two specific thunder generals. Imbued with the force of a blood oath sworn between ordinand and thunder general, the covenant binds the parties together in a relation- ship of master and military functionary. In large part, it is by virtue of this ritual relationship, struck during the ordination ceremony and echoed in the consecration of the ordinandi personal altar and in the text of his ordination certificate, that the ordinand may be considered a full-fledged Daoist by his community and by the denizens of the celestial realm. By the covenant, the Daoist derives confidence that he will be able to marshal the exorcistic power necessary to perform any rite free from interferences of demons, sprites, and noxious pneumas. This essay will unfold in four parts. First, it introduces the Meicheng region and the Daoists who live and work there. Second, it sketches the contours of an ordina- tion jiao practiced by one of the Daoist lineages in the region. Third, it describes the particular rite within the ordination jiao - the Rite of Transmission {bodu ke JSSfł, chuandu ke flJSfł) - in which a master bestows upon an ordinand the rites and teachings of the lineage. And finally, it highlights three crucial moments in the Rite of Transmission that demonstrate the centrality of the covenantal relationship between ordinand and thunder deity in the concept of ordained priesthood. I Tucked away in the Xuefeng Hills Sídlil that cut across north-central Hunan, Meicheng Township lies about 120 kilometers (approximately 75 miles) due west of Hunan's provincial capital, Changsha W&amp;, although it takes four and a half to five hours to navigate through the mountains by minibus. Anhua District was established</page><page sequence="5">Daubing Lips with Blood and Drinking Elixirs with the Celestial Lord Yin Jiao 273 in 1072 by the Song emperor Shenzong (r. 1067-1085), and from its founding until 1951, Meicheng served as its government seat and cultural center.4 Today, Meicheng is the main economic hub for the rural towns and villages of southeast Anhua County. Twice a month farmers and artisans from the entire region travel by bus or motorcycle to Meicheng to sell their produce and wares in the largest wet market in the region. The local dialect spoken in surrounding villages is associated with Meicheng and villagers consider themselves within Meicheng s cultural sphere. During the late imperial and republican periods, local religious life flourished throughout the Meicheng region.5 In the mid-1950s, the local government began to brand Daoist and Buddhist religious expressions as "feudal superstitions" (fengjian mixin iíâliÉíiO, and during the tumultuous times of the Cultural Revolution, government agents destroyed all the temples in the Meicheng region and prohibited any kind of religious activity. They confiscated texts, ritual scrolls, and other ritual paraphernalia. Many Daoists surrendered their heirlooms, gave up the practice, and towed the party line. Other Daoists surrendered to the authorities only scriptures that sing the praises of high deities such as the Jade Emperor (Yuhuang 3£M) and the Great Thearch of Purple Tenuity (Ziwei dadi But they surreptitiously buried in the fields the essential secret manuals ( mizhi |&amp;tf) that instruct them how to summon and command thunder deities. Still other Daoists tell stories of lightly striking ceramic tea cup covers with chopsticks to simulate cymbals while quietly performing truncated jiao for trusted friends late at night. By the late 1980s, governmental sensitivity to religious expression began to dull and many Daoists ventured to practice more openly while remaining wary of official censure. In 1992, the Anhua County Bureau of Culture ( Anhua xian wenhua ju published a pamphlet entitled "Materials for Singing at Funerals and Burials" (Binzang yanchang ziliao Pilītei), which dictated the kinds of hymns the government deemed appropriate for funerals. Local government cadres summoned all those officials of the Dao (&lt; daoguan MW) living in their jurisdictions, distributed the pamphlet, and charged them an administrative fee for a permit to perform funerary rites. Zhang Shihong 3RÄ3A, a local resident and collaborator with "Projet Hunan", reports that although the pamphlet meant continued gov- ernment scrutiny of funerals, it signaled that the government no longer considered traditional funerary rites as "superstitious" and was, with certain oversight and a taxation mechanism, willing to sanction certain traditional ritual activity. In 1993, the county government again cracked down on the Daoists who performed funer- als, and on families who hired them, fining them 100 to 300 yuan . But the policy only succeeded in bolstering funerary activity. Families of the deceased simply 4.

By the end of 1995, the county government finally granted wide param- eters for religious expression.6 Today, local religious activity in Meicheng is remarkably free, with notable exceptions such as Falun gong Lay patrons are slowly rebuilding temples throughout the Meicheng region while men again seek Daoist ordination. Some of these men are older and may come from families with Daoist traditions. They seek ordination titles that were not available to them during the roughly 30-year period when the government suppressed religious activity. Most ordination seek- ers are younger men who have not pursued school education after age 15. Many of them have a penchant for music and seek a profession that can employ their proclivities for the flute, cymbal, and drum as well as provide them the local status of an educated man able to read and write literary Chinese. Daoists in Meicheng are acutely aware that membership in their traditions offers a local alternative to the prestige gained from success in the national educa- tion system. The latter represents a coveted way out of rural poverty for the entire family. Many dream that their children will test into college and enter a lucrative profession. Families will take out loans far greater than their economic capacities in order to fund a college-bound son or daughter. But for those rural young men who, for one reason or another, do not climb up that ladder, becoming a Daoist offers another sort of education. One Daoist argues that the instruction in literary Chinese and musical arts afforded through the lineage provides a better education than high school or even college, because one's masters are far more invested than any schoolteacher. Daoist training affords men high social standing in the local community, even if their incomes remain low compared to what they could earn as secular professionals. When a man decides to become a Daoist priest, he seeks to apprentice him- self to one of the masters in the locale, who becomes known as his transmission master (« dushi SM). If the master agrees to take him on as a disciple, he takes his place as one of the five acolytes who supply music at the appropriate times during liturgies and proceeds to learn the rhythms of the rites on the job. He follows the musical patterns and movements of the older Daoists in the lineage, progressing by mastering the various liturgical instruments - first the gong, then the small and large cymbal, and finally the bamboo flute.7 Between ritual performances, he learns to read and pronounce the often archaic literary Chinese employed in the ritual manuals and scriptures by mimicking his main transmission master or any of his two auxiliary masters, known as the guarantor master ( baoju shi ÍS^Ěfp) and the presenting master (yinjin shi 3IÜlS5). The master recites or chants a line of text and the disciple follows, careful to strike the proper pronunciation and tone of voice. The disciple gradually learns the ritual movements and incantations from his masters and continually works to improve his flute playing. 6. Ibid. 7. As the most important instrument that keeps ritual time, the drum remains the respon- sibility of the more experienced Daoists in the lineage.</page><page sequence="7">Daubing Lips with Blood and Drinking Elixirs with the Celestial Lord Yin Jiao 275 After two to several years (the length of apprenticeship differs for each disciple), the transmission master decides that his student is competent enough to undergo an ordination jiao and divines a date. The ordinandi family funds the ordination and prepares to host it in the ordinandi natal home. In addition to arranging for th t jiao y including meals throughout the three or four days of the event, the head of the household also hosts a festive banquet on the last day to celebrate the newly ordained Daoist and thank the Daoists, relatives, neighbors, and friends for their attendance. 8 The following discussion of an ordination jiao (zouzhi jiao #K®Š, literally the ujiao for sending up [to the pantheon the title of] the office [sought by the ordi- nandi) and of the Rite of Transmission {bodu ke gjlJSfł) at its heart, is based on the practice of the lineage of Daoists who live and work in the village of Fuqing located about 12 kilometers (approximately 7.5 miles) west of Meicheng. The interpretations of the ritual action and texts that script it are, unless otherwise stated, my own, but have been heavily informed by my study of the rites with several of the seasoned Daoists in Fuqing. My aim is to paint a picture of the ordinationjïâo, and especially of the Rite of Transmission, as sympathetically as possible to the views of these Daoists, while drawing out the significance of the role of thunder deities in the fabric of the ritual performance and in these Daoists' own conceptions of what constitutes an ordained priest.9 II The two-to-four-day ordination jiao follows the same general format as a typical jiao offered in thanksgiving for a deity's protection and blessing. Each year Dao- ists in Fuqing typically perform thanksgiving jiao (xie'enjiao Iff SB!) dedicated to the Sagely Thearch of the Southern Marchmount (Nanyue shengdi ^IRS^) and to the bodhisattva Guanyin (Guanyin pusa K##®). An ordination orients each of the 15-19 discreet rites that comprise th t jiao toward the purpose of conferring upon an ordinand a title and rank of Daoist office, which occurs on the last day of the ritual during the Rite of Transmission, which is peculiar to ordinations. The rites preceding it afford the transmission master formal opportunities to announce to the celestial pantheon the office and the liturgical name of the Daoist- to-be. The program of a typical ordination jiao as performed by the lineage in Fuqing is generally as follows: - Day one: Preliminary Announcement to the Masters of the Lineage (yugao jiashu ^S^ilr); Banner Rite [to Summon] Sire Yin ( Yingongfanfa §£&amp;fiîfâ). 8. Zhang Shihong, art. cit. 9. For an illuminating discussion of a similar kind of ordination practiced by a lineage in Yangxi Township in Xinhua County UHbfl, about 70 kilometers (approximately 43 miles) southwest of Meicheng, see Qin Guorong "Guangchan gong changyong benjing yu 'neichuan kougong" in Chen Zi'ai Hua Lan ägiü (Alain Arrault), eds., op. cit., forthcoming.</page><page sequence="8">276 David Mozina - Day two: Cleansing Pollution [from the Altar Space] ( danghui Request for [Lustral] Water (qingshui If 7jc) ; Issue of Announcements ( shenfa Í#); Repeated Announcement to the Masters of the Lineage (fugao jiashu Receiving the Carriages [of the Deities of the Pantheon] (yingjia SEU). - Day three: Invitation of Buddhas ( qingfo Iff®); Audience before the Jade Emperor (Yuhuang chaoke Audience before the Thearch of Purple Tenuity ( Ziwei chaoke Audience before the Celestial Masters ( Tianshi chaoke Audience before the [Buddhist] Patriarch [Puan HHř] (Zushi chaoke ì S0BŠ0Í4; Audience before the Dark Thearch ( Xuandi chaoke - Day four: [Announcement to] the Masters of the Lineage for the Rite of Trans- mission (bodu jiashu Rite of Transmission ( bodu ke 8Jg?4); Pacifying the Dragons and Returning [the Pantheon to their Palaces] (anlong huixiang The rites that comprise the first day of the ordination jiao are dedicated to announcing to the divine authorities the purpose of the entire three-to-four-day enterprise.10 Through speech and written memorial, the transmission master, who acts as the main officiant (zhufa 3í&gt;ž) of the entire jiao, proclaims that he respect- fully intends to announce to the various levels of the pantheon the office he seeks for his ordinand, to confer upon his ordinand the right to receive salary for duties performed in the name of that office, and to promote his ordinand to a rank in the celestial bureaucracy (zouzhi shoulu shengxian Then the ordinand, performing his first public ritual as officiant, summons with talismanic writing and esoteric incantation the specific thunder general with whom he will make a covenant during the Rite of Transmission on the final day. We shall see below that this particular lineage of Fuqing summons General Yin Jiao and his legions.12 During the second day of th t jiao y the transmission master, or often one of the auxiliary masters performing the officiant role in his stead, establishes an altar space (i tan it) in the foyer of the ordinandi natal household. The officiant sanitizes the space of all noxious pneumas and demonic influences that might disrupt the pristine environment to which high deities in the pantheon will be invited. Next, he garners permission from the Dragon Kings (Longwang ffiï) and Water Bureau (shuifu 7jCJft) to draw water from a nearby mountain stream, which will be transformed into lustral water and used throughout the jiao. Then, with voice and written memorial, he reverently announces the purpose of the jiao to the deities of the entire pantheon and invites them to descend to the altar and take their places on their thrones. They are represented throughout the altar space by painted scrolls of deities that hang on the walls, placards with names of various celestial offices that sit upon the altar tables, and paper likenesses of deities that hang from the rafters.

In each of these audiences with high gods and patriarchs, the transmission master announces in speech and written memorial the candidacy of the ordinand. The master offers to each of these gods the ordinandi title of office and rank, and humbly seeks that they have recorded the ordinandi liturgical names in their celestial archives. The gods of the pantheon take their thrones in the altar space to inspect the transmission of office that will, as we shall see below, bestow upon the ordinand the status of deity (shen if) in the celestial bureaucracy. Finally on the fourth or last day of th tjiao, the transmission master once again invites the high deities, patriarchs, and masters of the lineage to attend specifically the Rite of Transmission. As the next section will show in more detail, the master entreats the deities to witness the transmission of the textual and material heirlooms 13. The pantheon invoked by this lineage in Fuqing includes familiar high gods such as the Three Pure Ones (. sanqing H}|f) and deities who have been associated with the Divine Empyrean (shenxiao WW) ritual tradition such as the Three Thearchs (sandi H^) - the Jade Emperor (Yuhuang dadi the Thearch of Purple Tenuity (Ziwei dadi the Heavenly Emperor (Tianhuang dadi - as well as the Nine Sovereigns (jiuchen f[3 [), including the Celestial Worthy of the Sound of Thunder Transforming All (Leisheng puhua tianzun ft and the Thunder Patriarch (Leizu dadi The transmission master invites patriarchs such as Lin Lingsu (1076-11x0) and Wang Wenqing BEÄPBP (1093-1153), the founders of the Divine Empyrean ritual movement, and the famed master Mo Yueding (c.1226- c.1294), as well as perfecteds ( zhenren MX) who are associated with thunder rites, such as Sa Shoujian and Wang the Fire Master (Huoshi Wang zhenren ikMīīMA)- Following the patriarchs, past masters of the lineage are invoked. The members who comprise the pantheon are, of course, valuable clues for rooting this present-day Fuqing lineage in Divine Empyrean traditions and perhaps even constructing a history - or imagined history - of this lineage. For an overview of the general pantheon associated with Divine Empyrean traditions, see Li Yuanguo, op. cit., 153-21 1. But we must keep in mind that working with pantheons to tease out the received history of a lineage can be tricky. Pantheons are shifting and lineage is not a straightforward analytic category. There are many deities and patriarchs that I have yet to identify, and their identities will likely show evidence that other ritual traditions have come to constitute the lineage as it is presented today. Furthermore, Daoists may easily construct their lines of descent from certain pantheons for specific social, political, and doctrinal reasons. Without further research, I hesitate to assert that this lineage in Fuqing is simply a Divine Empyrean lineage, which I fear would be a simplification of the historical process by which lineages develop over time. More sinological and theoretical work needs to be done before we can confidently historicize the exist- ing lineages in Meicheng. 14.

Ill The two-hour Rite of Transmission of Daoist and Buddhist Teachings (Daojiao Fojiao chuandu ke the climax of the entire ordination jiao, provides the stage upon which the ordinand finally receives the credentials and tools of an ordained priest qualified to officiate over Daoist ritual and Buddhist funerary rites. I will briefly sketch the contours of this rite here, in order to supply some ritual context that may orient the reader for the examination, in Part iv, of the role of thunder deities in typical ordinations in the Meicheng region. Having already invited the high deities, patriarchs, and masters of the lineage to witness the transmission, the transmission master acknowledges that the deities do not permit the teachings and rites to be passed on to just anyone. Only those mortals who have been destined to receive the ritual tradition are worthy to be ordained. He thus declares: [The Heavenly Worthy of] Primordial Commencement created the principles of the teachings of the rites, and the rites of the Dao are a step-by-step path. The dragon stanzas and phoenix seals await the appropriate person and only then will they be transmitted to him. Gemmy satchels and precious jade require a destined one and only then will they be bestowed on him. [The ordinandi] situation and sincerity have already been reported before the throne of the Thearch; his office and title have respectfully been memorial- ized before the steps of the Transcendents.

In a prepared written document called the Oath Certificate ( shici S§5), which the transmission master reads aloud to the pantheon and then transmits to them by burning, he formally declares that he himself has taken an oath with his own master, in which he swore to guard the precious knowledge of the rites. The transmission master expresses to the assembled deities an awareness of the grav- ity of bequeathing the ritual tradition. He is a caretaker of a revealed tradition of methods to seize control of the exorcistic power of thunder by assuming command of thunder deities, who embody that primordial potency. The transmission master vows, upon pain of punishment by a bolt of lightning, that he is not passing on the 15.

Under these strict conditions, the transmission master formally requests that the pantheon consider accepting the ordinand into their divine bureaucracy. Then, in a fascinating ritual sequence, the transmission master and ordinand together summon General Yin Jiao and a host of thunder deities, with whom, as we shall see below, the ordinand then concludes a covenant. The ordinand declares to the pantheon and mortal attendees of the rite that he puts his trust in the Three Refuges (sangui HÉfi) and accepts the Nine Precepts (jiujie fiM). The Dao, the revealed scriptures, and the lineage of masters constitute the Daoist Three Treasures ( sanbao HÄ) upon which the ordinand pledges to take refuge. The Nine Precepts oblige the ordinand to maintain proper attitude and conduct, befitting his position, and to avoid licentious and selfish behavior that runs counter to the ways of the Dao. The master and ordinand then conclude a blood covenant. The master assures that he has faithfully passed on the ritual knowledge he has received, while the ordinand vows that he will cherish the ritual knowledge and use it for the good of humanity. They each take a sip from a bowl of cinnabar water (danshui fj7jc) - water that has been dyed bright red with cinnabar powder and, according to the text, represents the blood of a sacrificed white horse. The ordinand swears by Heaven and Earth, and his own heart, that he will uphold his pledge under threat of divine punish- ment by means of a bolt of lightning or cutting wind.16 Next, the ordinand, kneeling nearly prostrate before his transmission master, receives from him the ritual implements he will need to perform the duties of the office to which he is applying. The ordinand receives the "texts of mystery" (xuanshu ~£W), the manuals that script the major Daoist rituals performed by the lineage, which were hand copied for him by his master prior to the ordination, and rever- ently places them in a large satchel that hangs about his neck. The ordinand then receives the seals (yin £p) needed to sign liturgical documents sent to the celestial courts and a wooden command placard (lingpai which carries the authority of the Jade Emperor and is used to issue commands to thunder deities as a secular judge might use a gavel to deliver a verdict. A Tianpeng ruler (Tianpeng chi ^ÜM),17 a sword (fian M), and a peach- wood club (taobang all find their way into the ordinandi satchel. They will be used to summon and interrogate demons. The master also confers two pennants, called zaodao banners (zaodao qi Hütt). When placed on the altar table, they aid in summoning thunder generals. Finally, the ordinand receives a hairpin (zan H), Daoist robes (pao ?È), and an audience tablet (hu %j), 1 6. Ibid., iia-i8a. 17. The wielder of the Tianpeng ruler has authority over life and death of demons (shengsha zhi quart By the Song dynasty, Tianpeng became a great general who, along with Tianyou Yisheng fclU (a northern Song title for the Black Killer, Heisha and Zhenwu J®, attends to the Northern Thearch (Beidi itiíř). Together, they are often referred to as the Four Sages of the Northern Culmen (beiji sisheng itíHHIl). See Edward L. Davis, Society and the Supernatural in Song China (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2,001), 67-79; Shin-yi Chao, Daoist Ritual State Religion , and Popular Practices: Zhenwu Worship from Song to Ming (960-1644) (Abingdon and New York: Routledge, 2011), 25-28.</page><page sequence="12">z8o David Mozina proper attire and accoutrements for an official who will have audiences with divine emperors and thearchs.18 After transmission of each item, the ordinand presents his master with a red envelope ( hongbao &amp;IÍÜ) of a few yuan jn, as his three masters or their surrogates recite a couplet of prose marking the joyous moment.19 The payments do not cover the cost of the items, which is included by the family in the remuneration it offers to the ordinandi three masters, but instead the bright red envelopes symbolically express thanks for the items and, more important, for the knowledge of how to use them. In a similar sequence, the ordinand takes refuge (guiyi Éjgfíc) in the Buddhist three treasures (sanbao Hït): the Buddha (fo ft), the Dharma (fa &gt;ž), and the Sańgha (seng fff). He makes four vows (siyuan EIJü) by which he pledges to save all sentient beings, put a stop to delusion, study the Buddhist tradition, and complete the Buddhist path. He also publicly accepts the Ten Precepts (shijie +$c) by which he swears not to fail to uphold Buddhist virtues. As above, the master bestows upon the ordinand the liturgical implements he will need: an incense burner (xianglu Ufi!) with which to establish altar spaces; a water bowl (shuiyu 7JC5Ë) to hold the lustral water needed to purify the altar; and a set of blocks (jiao ^), a brush (bi ®), an ink stone (yan 51), and ink (mo H) with which to prepare and transmit liturgical documents. The master also bequeaths a set of liturgical texts (fashu ir), the ritual manuals and scriptures needed to perform Buddhist mortuary ritual for members of the community, including a text containing the talismans (fuzhuan ffJĶ) required in funerals.20 Finally, the ordinand receives a golden bell (jinling&amp;W) and Buddhist prayer beads (shuzhu SS®).21 The transmission master then requests that General Yin Jiao and his legions recognize the personal altar of the ordinand, who, laden down with a satchel full of items, remains kneeling. Then, in a solemn moment, the master reads aloud and transmits by burning the ordination certificate, which formally submits the title of office and rank and the liturgical name of the ordinand to the divine attendees, and requests that they file the document away in the celestial archive. We shall examine these two ritual segments in Part iv. Finally, the master confers upon the ordinand an oral transmission through the medium of food. Over a bowl of vegetables and rice that has been prepared by the hosts, the master traces a talisman and breathes over the bowl. The ordinand, still kneeling, proceeds to eat every morsel of the portion, which, these Daoists explain, carries to the ordinand the numinous qi (lingqi MÄ-) of the master - and, by extension, 18.

The trans- mission rite nears its conclusion as transmission master, the guarantor master, and the presenting master each divine the ordinandi future by tossing blocks. Each outcome is coupled with a cheery saying, predicting a good and prosperous future for the new Daoist.23 Finally, the transmission master rewards the thunder dei- ties and the rest of the divine functionaries by requesting that they be promoted within the celestial bureaucracy, and then he sends all divine participants back to their heavenly palaces.24 As the climax of the ordination jiao, the Rite of Transmission achieves vital liturgical work. It introduces the ordinand by title and liturgical name to the divine authorities. It binds the ordinand to his master and lineage by means of a symbolic blood oath. The establishment of the covenant provides the basis of trust on which the transmission master may bequeath the precious texts, implements, and knowl- edge the ordinand will need to perform the Daoist and Buddhist rites by which he will earn his living. These liturgical goals generally resemble those of the great ordination liturgies of the early Celestial Masters (Tianshi ^05), medieval Lingbao IUI lineages, and present-day ordinations as performed in southern Taiwan and parts of Guizhou province.25 What strikes me as interesting in the ordinations I have zz.

IV Within the Rite of Transmission, I would like to focus on three junctures in which thunder deities play a fascinating and crucial role. These moments show that to become a Daoist in Meicheng means in no small measure that an ordinand has bound himself to a specific thunder general. The agreement allows the new Dao- ist to employ the exorcistic power supplied by the thunder general and his spirit armies in order to perform any rite, especially the prophylactic and exorcistic rites so conspicuous in the Daoist activity of central Hunan. The Covenant between the Ordinand and General Yin Jiao The first moment in the Rite of Transmission is the covenant itself, concluded between the ordinand and a thunder general. Each lineage in Meicheng invokes one or two specific thunder generals as the Daoists' main supplier of liturgical power. In the ritual practiced by the lineage in Fuqing examined here, the ordinand makes a compact with the Celestial Lord Yin Jiao (Yin Jiao tianjun iSJIKff), one of the thirty-six thunder generals of the heavenly Thunder Bureau ( leifu ®£f). Demons are said to quake with fear and scatter when they hear his golden bell ring; if they don't, they might suffer decapitation from his mighty halberd. Hagiographies of Yin Jiao's mortal life as the nominal son of King Zhou (Zhou wang Mī), the corrupt and wicked last ruler of the Shang dynasty p®, as well as his exploits as a demon, his conversion to Daoism, and his investiture as a martial deity of the Thunder Bureau are all preserved in the cache of "esoteric transmis- sions" ( michuan SMS) copied down through the generations of the lineage. The hagiography of Yin Jiao preserved by these Daoists refers the reader to the Ming vernacular novel Fengshen yanyi iiWMìà for more information on the god.26 This is fascinating because none of the Daoists I have encountered have ever read the Fengshen yanyi , and some of the older ones have never even heard of it outside the context of their hagiography. In Hunan we are finding living traditions of thunder ritual whose preserved texts draw on late imperial vernacular fiction - an intriguing extension of Mark Meulenbelds demonstration that late imperial fiction drew on traditions of thunder ritual from the Song, Yuan, and early Ming periods.27 Ordination Ranks in the Tunhuang Manuscripts," in G. Naundorf, ed., Religion und Philosophie in Ostasien: Festschrift für Hans Steininger (Würzburg: Königshausen und Neumann, 1985), 127-48. 26.

It is important to note that, in Meicheng, specific thunder deities are not assigned according to the ordinandi date and time of birth. In medieval Daoist ordination practice, initiands about to enter the Orthodox Unity ( Zhengyi JE-) grade of priesthood received a list or register (lu Ü) of the names of deities, including generals and clerks ( jiangli J1Ç30, who were charged to protect the initiand and aid in ritual practice. The specific deities listed on the reg- ister were related to the cosmic energy ( qi #0 dominant during the date and time of the initianďs birth, which in turn dictated the dominant energy of the initianďs body, from which generals and clerks emanated.28 Today we know that lineages in Taiwan often assign by name one thunder deity to an ordinand, based on the date and time of his birth.29 But the lineages in Meicheng do no such calculations. For the Daoists of Fuqing, tradition dictates that each of them rely on Yin Jiao as the most important thunder deity for the successful performance of ritual, and so each ordinand concludes a covenant specifically with him. As one Fuqing Daoist said, "We use Yin because the masters [of our lineage] taught us to do so." This does not mean that Daoists in Fuqing are confined to employing only Yin Jiao. Indeed, they employ by name several of the thirty-six thunder generals and their armies, especially Wang Lingguan 3EMK (also known as Wang Shan žE#), Ma Sheng MS# (also known as Ma Lingguan ISIIW), and Zhao Gongming ÍÔH0.3° Yet Fuqing Daoists stress that they privilege Yin Jiao as a kind of first among equal members of the Thunder Bureau. We shall see below that their ritual manuals list the rest of the thirty-six thunder deities under Yin Jiao's military standard. Making a covenant with General Yin is the key to employing the rest of the martial deities of the Thunder Bureau.31 28. K. Schipper, "Taoist Ordination Ranks," 132-133; K. Schipper, The Taoist Body, 63-64. 29. P. Fava, personal communication. 30. Throughout the Meicheng region, Daoists refer to Generals Yin, Wang, Ma, and Zhao as the "four great marshals" (si da yuanshuai and employ them specifically to protect the altar spaces constructed for jiao and minor rites. The documents embedded in the wooden images of ancestors and local worthies collected by "Projet Hunan" show that these four hang together as a defined group throughout central Hunan. 31. Other lineages in the Meicheng region also make bonds primarily with Yin Jiao, and yet others with Wang Lingguan. Still other lineages conclude covenants with both Yin Jiao and Wang Lingguan. I have not yet figured out why Meicheng lineages are especially enamored with these two thunder deities, but answering this question will almost certainly provide a key for interpreting the relatively recent historical shifts in the liturgical traditions there. Considering that the ritual manuals preserved by the lineage in Fuqing abound with equally developed rituals designed to summon Yin Jiao, Wang Lingguan, Ma Sheng, Zhao Gongming, Zhang Jue (also known as Zhang Yuanbo and Wen Qiong the particular emphasis on Yin Jiao as the thunder general whom Fuqing Daoists specifically single out to summon and "use" first among all others suggests that the practice of identifying a specific lineage with a specific thunder deity, or two, is a relatively recent development.</page><page sequence="16">284 David Mozina The covenant with Yin Jiao begins with his summons. Facing each other across the outer altar table of the ritual space, with the transmission master standing in the northern position of authority and the ordinand in the southern position of deference, the master and the ordinand together summon Yin Jiao. As the trans- mission master beckons Yin Jiao to grace the altar space, the ordinand mirrors the incantations, visualizations, and ritual movements of his master. The Daoists of the lineage interpret this parallel ritual action to indicate that the transmission master sponsors the ordinand to the celestial deities during the ordination jiao. The poignant imagery embodies the covenantal relationship sworn between the ordinand and his master, a relationship in which the master promised to teach his disciple everything he knows in exchange for the disciple's loyalty and reverence for the power of the ritual methods. Master and ordinand together summon Yin Jiao so that the master may present his disciple to the thunder deity for the purpose of concluding a covenant with him. The master and ordinand first transform their mundane bodies into the rarified bodies of celestial deities. Through visualization, incantation, and the use of hand mudrãSy they imagine they immolate their earthly bodies of flesh and bone. Out of the ashes first emerges the august body of Zhang Daoling Sflifißt, followed by that of Zhenwu JfÄ- The fact that the master and ordinandi bodies transform into these specific deities is meaningful. Poul Andersen has noticed that the deity into whom Daoists transform is often the first patriarch of their ritual tradition.32 As self-identified Zhengyi Daoists, the priests of Fuqing consider their ultimate patriarch to be Zhang Daoling. Since at least the late 13th century, Daoists who practice strains of thunder ritual have been transforming into Zhenwu in order to summon thunder deities.33 Often referred to as "ancestral or patriarchal master" (zushi ÍSĚřp) by Fuqing Daoists and their manuals, Zhenwu is considered by them to be a second patriarch.34 The transformation of the master and ordinandi bodies (huashen/bianshen {bJ§7 SI#), first into Zhang Daoling and then into Zhenwu, nec- essarily precedes any direct communication with thunder deities. By transforming their bodies into patriarchs - august divinities in the pantheon - officiants acquire ontological status sufficient to command a thunder god such as Yin Jiao to heed their summons.3* 32.

The procedure is a version of the common inner alchemical operation of refining primal essence (yuanjing jcff) into primal qi (yuanqi ŤÉfO, and primal qi into primal spirit (yuanshen jtffi). By forming a hand mudrã called the Jade Trace (yuwen master and ordinand in unison grasp a round beam of the golden light that wreathes their numinous bodies. From the cupped hands of the mudrā, they inhale the golden light deep down into their hearts. The Daoists regard this fiery, rarified qi originating from outside their bodies as the primal essence, the first material utilized in the alchemical operation. It mixes with the fire associated with the heart to produce primal qi.39 Master and ordinand further refine this primal qi by means of the well-estab- lished inner alchemical operation of melding the opposite trigrams Kan and Li HI. Clarke Hudson has characterized this symbolic language of trigrams from the Yijing US as expressing an effort by the adept to reverse a cosmogonie devolution, and the Zuqi michuan held by these Daoists concurs.40 Before the cosmos as we know it came into being, a state of primal unity reigned in which pure yang qi ßg®, symbolized as the trigram Qian E5, existed in pristine motionlessness. As this anterior heaven ( xiantian began to differentiate, producing the regular move- ments of our posterior heaven ( houtian according to the patterns of the five phases and eight trigrams, primal Qian S lost its central yao- line St and became the trigram Li m Eī. The trigram Kun pur t yin qi borrowed the central yao- line of Qian to become the trigram Kan $K iE. In the cycle of generation and decay that characterizes the posterior heaven, the trigrams Kan and Li reside as opposites whose melding is imagined as the method to reacquire the lost state of cosmic unity composed of yang qi.Ą1 The human body is imagined as a microcosm of cosmic devolution. At conception, the fetus comes into being as a product of the fathers essence ( jing If), associated with semen, and the mothers essence, associated with blood. During gestation in the womb, it is composed of a pristine body of pure yang qi, symbolized by the trigram Qian. Emotions associated with human existence in this world - delight, anger, grief, and joy (xi nu ai le - have not yet come forth. At the moment of birth, the pristine body of the baby clashes with the heavenly and earthly qi of our posterior world. As during the cosmogony, the pristine Qian trigram loses its central yao- line and becomes the trigram Li. The wandering yao- line becomes lodged within the trigram Kun to create Kan.

In their mind's eye, they recover the central yang line from the Kan trigram and use it to replace the central yin line of the Li trigram, thereby transforming it back to its original pure yang state, the pre-natal and pre-cosmic qi symbolized by the Qian trigram. These Daoists refer to this pristine yang qi as primal spirit (yuanshen 7ĚW).43 Master and ordinand then visualize that this primal spirit descends to the lower cinnabar field located three inches below the navel between the kidneys. In a circular motion, they rub their bellies with both hands nine times to produce within their lower cinnabar fields a tiny Yin Jiao - rather than a generic fetus, as might be expected. They visualize him growing in size until he bursts forth from the lower cinnabar field and travels slowly up through the Three Passes (. sanguan HIB) along the dorsal tract - the coccygeal pass, the spinal pass, and the occipital pass.44 When he reaches the upper cinnabar field located in the brain, referred to as the Muddy Pellet ( niwan master and ordinand visualize that Yin Jiao lays down his great halberd and shield, and has an audience with his ultimate superior, the Thearch of Purple Tenuity, ruler of the Northern Culmen who, within the microcosm of the body, is imagined to reside in the head of the adept. The Thearch grants Yin Jiao permission to obey the summons of the Daoists. Then, with a great "whoosh" sound, master and ordinand exteriorize Yin Jiao through the middle eye they imagine to be positioned low on their foreheads, between the eyebrows.

Fava, "Han Xin's Revenge".</page><page sequence="20">288 David Mozina Master and ordinand also exteriorize Generals Wang Lingguan and Zhang Jue ?g££ through very similar procedures scripted in the lineage's liturgical manuals. On behalf of his ordinand, the transmission master then politely offers all exteriorized thunder generals tea and wine, but for the rest of the transmission rite full attention is paid to Yin Jiao for the purpose of concluding a covenant with him. The Daoists of this lineage emphasize that they create a bond specifically with General Yin, but that their covenant with him implicates all other thunder generals. The actual covenant between the ordinand and Yin Jiao unfolds in three phases: a sacrifice, a blood covenant, and a pronouncement of oath. As in the rest of the ritual, the transmission master acts as the ordinandi sponsor and so directs the action and does the talking. He instructs lay acolytes to set on the altar table five bowls of rice liquor and a cauldron of raw pork fat with a single stick of incense lodged in it. The acolytes then cut the throat of a cockerel with a cleaver and sprinkle its blood on the meat and into the bowls of liquor and present them as sacrifice to Yin Jiao. After the blood splatters, the transmission master incants: [Adding] blood to this liquor arouses generals and marshals, and musters spirit armies; it makes virile [gods] powerful, and makes heroes vigorous. They are very able to pull down trees and move mountains; they can suddenly overturn rivers and seas. [Yin Jiao], listen to my order and make the clouds and winds converge in celebration! Receive my talismanic command and make the demons and spirits respectfully venerate me! To save human beings and benefit all things, we should make our covenant (meng as firm as metal and stone. In daubing our lips with blood and drinking the elixir [of bloody liquor], we ought to make brilliant its peach-blossom color.46 Sweep away noxious demons and erase their noxious traces!

In his analysis of the evolution of thunder deities through the late Ming dynasty, Mark Meulenbeld has shown that thunder deities were imagined to retain something of their demonic natures even after they had been sublimated into the ranks of Daoist martial deities.49 Here, the bloody offering piques the savage nature of Yin Jiao and attracts him to the 46. The sense of "make brilliant its peach-blossom color" ( xuan taohua zhi se seems to be that the reddish hue of the elixir is deepened or intensified by its application to the lips and consumption. 47. In traditional Chinese medicine, the liver and gall bladder were imagined to have a close mutual relationship: Hanyu da cidian , vol. 6, 1169. The metaphor "liver and gall bladder face or illumine each other" (gan dan xiangzhao jFFflSfSP^) expresses that two parties meet in sincerity and establish close ties. 48.

Indeed, Daoists in Fuqing explain that Yin Jiao, as every thunder deity, was once a demon and so lusts after blood and raw flesh. The sacrificial offer- ings propitiate the powerful and reckless deity and contribute to creating a bond between him and the ordinand. Representing the ordinand, the transmission master concludes the blood cov- enant with the thunder general. To do so, the master does not literally daub his lips with the bloody liquor. The image, instead, echoes the ancient oathing practice of smearing the lips with the blood of a sacrificial animal. Nor does he imbibe the grim mixture, as has been fairly standard practice in concluding covenants throughout China's history.50 Here, the images of lips daubed with cockerel blood and the pres- ence of bloody liquor function as metonyms for concluding a solemn covenant. The force of symbolically shared liquor is strengthened by the blood of the cockerel, considered to supply the yang force of life. To smear lips or consume blood also strengthens the power of the spoken words in the oath. The words spoken by the master on behalf of his ordinand carry the force of life and so are able to achieve the desired bind between two non-kin parties.51 Again on behalf of the ordinand, the transmission master pronounces the oath with words charged with yang energy: Attentively listen to these words of warning: Thunder gods, Thunder gods! With the first libation, I make an oath with Heaven. On high I accord with the heart of Heaven; should Heaven turn on me, the sun and moon will cease to shine. With the second libation, I make an oath with Earth. In the middle I accord with the heart of Earth; should Earth turn on me, the grass and trees will cease to grow. With the third libation, I make an oath with you. Thunder deities, functionaries, and generals, do not turn away from [my] merit. I have venerated you and so you must exhibit your numinous efficacy. Should marshal turn on master, ritual water will not be numinous; should master turn on marshal, incense will not work. Whenever one disobeys a command, Heaven will have fixed punishments.

As he makes the oath with Earth, he flicks the liquid toward the ground. With these first two libations, the master swears to Heaven and Earth that he, on behalf of his ordinand, will behave in accordance with their intentions. He utters a malediction that calamity will befall Heaven and Earth should they not comply 50. For a brief history of blood covenants, see B. ter Haar, op. cit., 151-167.

Heaven and Earth have long been included in oathing rituals as guarantors, responsible for enforcing punishments should a party break the oath." With a flick of bloody liquor over the outer altar table, the master makes an oath to all the denizens of the Thunder Bureau. But the Fuqing Daoists insist that they are especially visualizing Yin Jiao standing in front of them, as a first among equals. Using the pronoun ru &gt;#, the master addresses General Yin as a superior addresses an inferior, reminding the thunder deity that he is entering an asym- metrical pact of subservience to the Daoist. Yet in a revealing phrase, the master lays out the terms of the oath: "I have venerated you and so you must exhibit your numinous efficacy." The thunder deity supplies the Daoist the power he needs to perform ritual in exchange for respectful cult designed to propitiate the unruly god. The ambiguous nature of Yin Jiao as both loyal subordinate and restive, semi- demonic deity is not lost in this ritual sequence. The god is addressed with both firm resolve and wary respect. The point I wish to make in this section is that the ordinandi covenant with the thunder deity Yin Jiao plays a crucial role in the Rite of Transmission. Ever since the ordinations of early Celestial Masters and medieval Lingbao neophytes, ordinands have made covenants with their masters as a prerequisite for receiving the texts, implements, titles, and vestments of ordained Daoist officiants 54. Ordinands have made bonds with their immediate superiors in order to earn the privilege of continuing the liturgical tradition. In the Meicheng region, we are seeing tradi- tions that, in addition, privilege formal bonds with inferior functionaries in the celestial bureaucracy, such as thunder deities. For the Daoists of Fuqing, texts and implements would be rendered inefficacious without the numinous power supplied by Yin Jiao under the terms of the blood covenant struck between him and the ordinand through the sponsorship of the transmission master. Since the Song dynasty, Daoists have been making blood covenants with thunder deities and here, we see that that practice has evolved to become a constitutive element of the very notion of what it is to become a Daoist priest.55 It is instructive to make another comparison with previous ordination rituals. In early Celestial Master traditions, the ordinand received the essential breath ( fing If) from his master in the form of a talisman. The ordinand then learned to visualize that essential breath in the form of anthropomorphic officials (guan H) within his body, and exteriorize them along with subsidiary generals and clerks ( jiangli }ļ#5Ē). These emanations formed a corps of deities the ordinand could call upon to protect 53.

These deities stood guard to protect the new Daoist from demonic influences and formed an entourage with which he could travel throughout the cosmos.57 In the transmission rite practiced in Fuqing today, the ordinand exteriorizes first and foremost General Yin Jiao by means of an inner alchemical operation. General Yin and his troops are not only charged with protecting the Daoisťs body and the altar space during the liturgy, but are also arranged about the ordinandi newly consecrated personal altar, as we shall see in the next section. Installing Yin Jiao and his Minions at the Thunder Altar of the Ordinand The second moment of the Rite of Transmission during which Yin Jiao plays a major role is his installation at the ordinandi personal altar. This segment of the ritual is called the "dispatch of generals" ( hojiang WŘ). During the sequence, the transmission master reads aloud a memorial announcing that, by the power of his Daoist office and rank, he appropriates Yin Jiao and a host of thunder deities and commands them to affiliate themselves with the ordinandi newly conferred thunder altar. The thunder altar is the ordinandi personal altar in his home. In addition to receiving an official title of office and rank, as well as investiture in a particular stellar diocese (zhi &gt;ê) associated with a particular cosmic energy (qi ^), he also receives a personal altar, called a thunder altar ( leitan Si#), and a rites chamber (fajing The names of each of these liturgical venues rotate according to the sexagesimal cycle and are assigned according to the ordinandi fundamental destiny {benming :$np), determined by the position of the stars and planets at his birth.58 The newly ordained Daoist will make daily offerings to his masters, to the patriarchs of the lineage, and to the high gods of the pantheon at his personal thunder altar. It seems that in the past the Fuqing Daoists may have used a rites chamber for private meditation and preparation for ritual performances, but nowadays they mark off no separate structure or space in the household for such activities.59 s6. K. Schipper, The Taoist Body , 63-64. 57. C. Benn, The Cavern Mystery , 48, and same author "Daoist Ordination and Zhai Ritu- als," 333. 58. Further fieldwork and collection of texts from the lineage in Fuqing is necessary to define exactly which astrological scheme (or schemes) the Daoists use to determine fundamental destiny. 59. The rites chamber may have at one time functioned similarly to the pure or silent chamber (qingshi ;§ ig, jingshi if Ig) of medieval Daoism, in which meditation, prayers, and zhai If fasts were performed in an enclosed chamber with only an incense burner in the center. Kristofer Schipper reports that the Daoists of Master Chen Rongsheng's lineage, in Tainan H^i, also do not seem to mark off a pure chamber ( qingshi &gt;§ ^), which their ordination documents list as a corollary to the Daoisťs personal altar ( tan i|[). See K. Schipper, The Taoist Bodyy 91-93. For an account of the development of the concept of an enclosed chamber ( jingshi ffM, huandu used for solitary self-cultivation in pre-Qin and Han texts through Shangqing texts, Tang poetry, and Song philosophical and Quanzhen sources, see Vincent Goossaert, "Entre</page><page sequence="24">2,92, David Mozina Standing and facing south at the outer table of the altar space, the transmission master introduces Yin Jiao and the thunder deities under his standard to the newly consecrated thunder altar of the ordinand, who kneels prostrate on the other side of the outer altar table, facing north. The master pronounces a memorial: Having requested the favor [of the deities] , registered [the ordinandi liturgical] name, and recorded his office, now the Transmission Rite of the Celestial Terrace grants the construction of a new [thunder] altar. Let the following be clear: the status of the thunder lords is powerful in the Celestial Bureau; their offices are listed in the Divine Empyrean. They take charge of the metrics of creative transformation, and control the command of the thunderclap. They protect and maintain the rites of the Dao, and zealously stir the winds of mystery. Whenever there are affairs, it is appropriate to notify them. In order to make solemn the dispatch of this memorial, I request that the Celestial Lord Yin Jiao - the the Earth Controller Great Year of the Rites of the Anterior Heaven - and all the deities under his standard . . . convene and reverently accept the Thearch's command to come out of the Gate of Quaking Heaven,60 attend the jiao banquet, and enjoy fragrant offerings.

They must pitch camp and establish an outpost, and station themselves about the new altar. They must obey their office and support [the ordinand] , forever assisting in the rites of the tradition. And they should accept the sacrifices from the master of this altar and assist the latter-day student's performances of the rites. &gt; wmn ■ zrnit zm • » mmzm • mmm • mm n# • i » rm um &gt; • mm ä ' is&amp;ùm ° » mmm » » mirnm • mm®# • *©»&gt;£ • 11s zmiz ' • 61 The transmission master dispatches a request that General Yin and the rest of the thunder deities take up their duties vis-à-vis the ordinand. Instead of exteri- orized officials, generals, and clerks arranging about the adept's body, as in early Celestial Master and medieval Lingbao ritual, here the exteriorized General Yin and his legions undertake their protective duties by becoming affiliated with the ordinandi newly consecrated thunder altar. Yin Jiao and his military minions are to pitch camp about the thunder altar, thus establishing a recognizable place on this earth, in which to assemble whenever the ordinand may summon them by means of written communique, sacrificial offerings, and exteriorization.

The memorial lists Yin Jiao first and foremost among the thunder deities the transmission master dispatches to serve the ordinand. In addition to Yin's assistant generals, Wang Huai and Jiang Rui several well-known thunder generals also march under his standard ( huixia JUT). Generals Wang ÎWÊ, Ma HSH, and Zhao Xin Hanchen ^/HE, Deng Bowen §M0/S, Zhang Jue 5gEE, Wen Qiong Yang Gengfang Zhu Yan 7^0, Gao Diao and Kang Ning Hg are specifically mentioned among the thirty-six thunder generals and seventy- two assistant commanders who are all imagined to follow Yin's lead. In this ritual, all the major thunder deities are organized under the auspices of Yin Jiao. The thunder generals identified by name do not seem to be inherently inferior to Yin. The ritual manuals preserved by the lineage provide equally detailed instructions for summoning generals Yin, Wang, Ma, Zhao, Zhang, and Wen. But in the ritual tradition that has come to be practiced in Fuqing, General Yin has assumed the role as first among equals and the Daoists of the lineage regard him as the thunder general upon whom they primarily rely, just as other lineages in the Meicheng region rely especially on Wang Lingguan or both Yin and Wang. The "dispatch of generals" segment of the Rite of Transmission functions to establish a spatial relationship between Yin Jiao and the ordinand; all other recognized thunder deities follow suit. Yin Jiao and the Ordination Certificate The third and final moment during the Rite of Transmission in which we can clearly see the significant role Yin Jiao plays in the making of a new Daoist is the conferring of the ordination certificate. Near the end of the Rite, the transmission master reads out loud and then confers upon the ordinand - now a neophyte - this certificate, which the master has prepared prior to the ordination. It formally records the event of the ordination: the place, the date, the sponsors, the program of rites performed during the jiao, as well as the pertinent information that identifies the neophyte as having attained the credentials of an ordained officiant of the lineage's Daoist and Buddhist rites. The document states the neophyte's title of office and rank, his liturgical names, his stellar diocese and cosmic energy, and the names of his personal thunder altar and rites chamber. The certificate also lists the liturgi- cal manuals, ritual implements and vestments bequeathed to the neophyte by his transmission master. The last item on the list is a roster of thunder deities who have come under the control of the neophyte. The roster, led of course by Yin Jiao, lists the same throng of thunder generals, assistant generals, and tutelary divinities under Yin Jiao's standard that were installed at the neophyte's thunder altar during the dispatch of generals segment of the ritual. Immediately following the roster, the ordination certificate states:</page><page sequence="26">294 David Mozina In the Celestial Terrace [Ordination Rite] , [the neophyte] relied upon his master to be ordained.

He ought not be reckless, wild, or indolent; his numinous power ought to manifest as soon as called upon. Master and marshal resonate with mutual trust; spirit and mortal are of unified intention. They are forever interconnected as the heart is with the belly; they perpetually reflect each other as do the lungs and the liver. mmmmmm * mmmmu mñ • wmxm ° • mm » ip mm ° f ° 63 The passage makes explicit the allegiance that Yin Jiao and, by implication, the thunder deities under his standard owe the neophyte due to the covenant concluded during the Rite of Transmission. Although the word is used neither in the language of this ritual nor by the Daoists of Fuqing when explaining the ordination certificate, the roster of thunder deities may be understood as a kind of register (lu Ü). Used in Daoist ritual since the time of the early Celestial Masters, a register is essentially a roster that lists the names, titles, talismans, or icons of deities whom the Dao- ist may summon from within his body. Registers have often been conferred upon ordinands during rites of transmission.64 Here, the ordination certificate provides a register of the thunder deities under the new Daoist's command and documents the blood covenant that bound Yin Jiao and the listed thunder deities to the Daoist. In addition to listing the register of Yin Jiao and his fellow thunder deities, the ordination certificate itself is described by members of the lineage as a kind of contract (hetong êl°l) between the Daoist and the authorities of the celestial bureaucracy. Two almost identical copies of the ordination certificate are prepared - a yang ß§ copy to be kept by the neophyte and a yin Pi copy to be dispatched to the celestial realm by burning. At the end of both is inscribed in bold, cinnabar ink the main talisman that the Daoist will forever use to summon to his command General Yin. Utilizing an ancient practice in which tallies made of cloth, wood, or metal were split in half and retained by two parties as proof of a binding relationship, the talisman here functions as a tally and is rent down the middle, the right half inscribed on 62. Yin Jiao and the other thunder deities are bound by oath to respond when the Daoist summons them by employing the "heart seal" {xinyin &gt;i^£p) specific to each of them. This seal, an inscription in highly stylized celestial script of the deity's personal name, often accompanied with an incantation, is an essential tool for summoning thunder deities.

Mozina, "Summoning the Exorcist: The Role of Heart Seals ( xinyin &gt;[&gt;£p) in Calling Down a Demon-Quelling Deity in Contemporary Daoist Thunder Ritual," in Florian C.

Instead, he immediately takes up the post in the celestial bureaucracy that was assigned to him during his ordination and documented in his ordination certificate.

The yang certificate functions as a kind of passport that, when tallied with its yin counterpart, verifies the Daoisťs identity and qualifies him to assume duties among the masters of the lineage. It is significant that the main talisman this lineage of Daoists uses to summon Yin Jiao in all their rituals is literally at the heart of the ordination certificate. The talisman to summon General Yin is rent in two and functions as the tally that identifies a deceased Daoist to the celestial bureaucracy. In the symbolic form of a rent talisman, we see expressed the idea that the covenantal relationship between the Daoist and the thunder deity is bound up with the celestial status of the Daoist. For this lineage in Fuqing, to be recognized as a Daoist by the divine bureaucracy is to possess the ability to summon especially Yin Jiao, acquired through the blood covenant concluded with the thunder general during the Rite of Transmission. Conclusion A close reading of the Rite of Transmission in the context of the interpretations of the Daoists who perform it reveals that a covenantal bond between an ordinand and a specific thunder deity is constitutive of the very notion of what it means to be a Daoist in Meicheng, Hunan. In addition to striking a blood covenant with ones transmission master - a prerequisite for an ordinand to receive the texts and implements needed to practice the rites - an ordinand must also conclude a blood covenant with a thunder general, who leads a roster of thunder deities supply- ing the efficacious power the Daoist needs to perform ritual. For the Daoists of Fuqing village, a covenant with General Yin Jiao is a sine qua non to enter the 68. The reference to a jade-ring tally conjures the idea that the yang and yin certificates form two material halves of a contractual obligation. In a 13th century ordination manual, the jade-ring tally is defined as an object that binds a master and disciple to each other, as well as to specific divinities. See Shangqing lingbao dafa DZ 1223, 43.12b: "A jade-ring tally is used to bind an oath to the Three Officials and conclude a covenant with the Ten Heavens, [in order to] carry on [the bond] for eternity and strengthen the pledge. The transmission master dare not conceal truth and put forth falsehood; the disciple dare not rebel against the Dao and turn his back on his master. By dividing the jade ring, [master and disciple] will never betray their covenant; by splitting the tally, they will never turn away from their oath." = w ' • ¿hammam ° • 69.
