The scientific term Mantis religiosa is La Mante religieuse or Prie Dieux in French, Gottesanbeterin in German, and Praying Mantis in English. These terms indicate a trans-linguistic connection between the mantis and prophecy, sanc- tity, and prayer. The term "praying" was apparently given to the mantis because of the insect's distinctive posture while awaiting its prey: holding its front legs together before its chest. The visual as- sociation with praying is enhanced by its habit of swaying back and forth, like a leaf in the wind, in order to mislead its victim. The mythologies that have evolved around the mantis in vari- ous cultures all feature a distinct ambivalence. It is simultaneously magical and holy as well as demonic and destructive. Since the mystical powers of the mantis (positive and negative) are always associated with the female, the insect will be referred to hence- forth as "she." The most characteristic idiosyncrasy of the female mantis is her devouring of the male during or directly after the sexual act. Sometimes she decapitates the male at its start, his body perform- ing his duty automatically, like a sex-machine.2 Because of this bru- tal custom, it has been argued that the mantis should be called "preying" rather than "praying."3 Some scientists claim that the beheading of the male results in reflexive and convulsive spasms that ensure successful fertilization, while others maintain that the female eats the male because copu- lation demands extra nourishment.4 In fact, this phenomenon is not as common as might be thought. Under natural conditions, many males escape, as cannibalism of the male is more frequent in the close confines of a small cage. Indeed, some scientists claim that the decapitation of the male is not a natural phenomenon at all and takes place only in captivity.5 Thus, while the mantis's bad reputation may be undeserved, the Surrealists, unaware of the scientific evidence, reinforced the myth to such an extent that the Praying Mantis is universally asso- ciated with the preying female. The French sociologist and avant- garde writer, Roger Caillois, contributed greatly to the mantis myth in his two essays published in the Surrealist journal Mino- taure, "La Mante religieuse" (1934) and "Mimetisme et psy- chastenie l6gendaire" (1935). Both impressed the Surrealists.' Because of her posture, Salvador Dalif identified the praying woman in Jean-Francois Millet's L'Angilus (1857-59; The Louvre) with the mantis. Since Dalf considered this to be the same posture the mantis assumes in coitus before devouring the male, he thus saw this position as expressing the woman's sexual frustration.7 L'Angilus apparently inspired a number of Dali's paintings, among them Atavism of Twilight (1933-1934; Kunstmuseum, Berne), in which Dali's couple reflects the pose of Millet's, but the man has a skull for a head and a gaping hole in his chest above his heart, as though the female has already bitten him." The mantis is not the only female that kills the male. A similar phenomenon is common among certain kinds of spiders, scorpi- ons, and beetles. Indeed, some of these, such as the Black Widow, have become symbols of the femme fatale who precipitates physi- cal and/or emotional castration, even death.9 However, the Surrealists were captivated almost exclusively by the mantis be- cause of her many ambivalent attributes. To them she embodied the most negative female archetype, the "castrating woman," who represents cannibalism and death. The moment of death commingling with the creation of new life has led many cultures to associate the mantis with fertility and revival. Because of this dual connection, the mantis evokes pri- mordial fears or desires in our collective unconsciousness while representing the female archetype, in the Jungian meaning of the term. At the same time she represents the two primordial Freudian instincts: Eros (or libido), the sexual motivating force of creation, and the "death instinct," the desire for self-destruction.'0 Caillois argues that there are some creatures whose forms and behaviors invite poetic metaphors, that ambivalent or antithetical meanings are especially powerful, and that since the mantis pro- vides such imagery, she offers a useful means of "lyrical communi- cation."" Her anthropomorphic appearance contributes further to her symbolic image, and her activities are often interpreted in ac- cordance with human behavioral patterns. Her powerful poetic image is probably one reason the mantis fascinated the Surrealists. The mantis as female archetype and the mythology surrounding her habits featured in their works. Andre Breton and Paul Eluard cultivated mantes in their homes, studied them closely, and invited others to observe the spectacle of their macabre sexual rites. Eluard even told Caillois that their sexual act reflected the ideal sexual relationship-diminishing the male and magnifying the female-making it completely natural, he argued, for the female to take advantage of her momentary superiority and kill the male.'2 The connection between eroticism and death was common in Surrealist thought and was developed especially in the ideas of George Bataille, who believed sex and death to be inextricably linked.13 Andre Masson, influenced by Bataille, depicted the man- tis many times, particularly after 1934, when he moved to Spain and acquired some of his own.14 In one of his mantis paintings, Summer Divertissement (1934; Private Collection), humanized mantes revel in a carnivalesque and bestial orgy. The Surrealists' attraction to the mantis is underscored by the two most prominent motifs in their art, metamorphosis and vagina dentata. Both are represented frequently through the image of the mantis. Metamorphosis-the transformation of an inanimate object from one form into another, or the transfiguration of living forms into inanimate objects (and vice versa)-was used as an artistic means of challenging reality, that which is perceived by the senses, in order to reach another, parallel world, one resembling the world SPRING / SUMMER 2000</page><page sequence="2">ILi ' i ,J Fig. 1.

Breton argued that the fusion of these two worlds is needed to create a superior world: "I believe in the future transmutation of those two seemingly contradictory states, dream and reality, into a sort of absolute reality, of surreali- ty, so to speak."'15 Metamorphosis embodies the vision of Breton, and the mantis is a metamorphic image. Its capacity to change and transform de- rived primarily from camouflage techniques, which Caillois calls "mimetisme."'6 The mantis can disguise itself as a leaf, either alive and green or wilting and brown; it can lie in wait motionlessly for its prey and then pounce swiftly. Examples of mimetisme can be seen in a number of paintings by Max Ernst, in which metamorphosing fauna and flora merge in- to one another. Sometimes they are camouflaged in such a way that they become almost indistinguishable. In Joy of Life (1936; Fig. 1), only on close inspec- tion (and partly by guessing) can the two mantes be de- tected at the bottom of the painting. Probably a male and a female, they are depicted in the process of an ambiguous activity, part copulation, part battle, and, indeed, probably both. The female appears to be winning, as the male (so it seems) is lying on his back with no head.17 The Surrealists also ad- mired the mim6tisme of the mantis because it represents a need to become one with nature. This pantheistic de- sire-to destroy the bound- aries between humanity and nature, to break down the walls of one's self, to become nothing and thus unite with nature-was described by Caillois as a yearning for the primordial, for a return to prebirth unconsciousness, to the state of existence that precedes awareness. But, as Caillois observed, in order to be swallowed up in this way we must first lose our indi- viduality; he therefore refers to it as a desire to eradicate individu- ality-disindividualiser.'8 Caillois sees this phenomenon as weak- ening, as a loss of ego substance, and he calls the space in which the individual wishes to be lost the "devouring force."'9 Erich Neumann uses similar terms when discussing the image of the negative female archetype, the Terrible Devouring Mother. The weaker the ego, he writes, the stronger the gravitation of the unconscious, in which the ego wishes to "sink" and be "swallowed up."20 Neumann, who portrays the Terrible Devouring Mother with a mouthful of teeth-the vagina dentata image-sees a corre- lation between the fear of being swallowed up by her and the fear of castration: both represent a state of immaturity and are symbol- ized by teeth.21 The desire to be swallowed up is dangerous; the need to lose one's self and to return to the primordial state of unconsciousness is in fact a suicide, a "death-drive." According to Neumann, we can confound this instinct through awareness. Confronting this danger, and elevating it from the unconscious to the conscious, is the first step toward overcoming it.22 Because symbols and metaphors operate on both the conscious and the unconscious lev- els, they enable us to express our primordial desires and experi- ence danger without really being in danger. The mantis is such a symbol: through her image we represent our desire to be swal- lowed up, at the same time neutralizing the threat of death (which is inherent in such a desire), for the mantis is merely a metaphor. The mantis's importance as metaphor is enhanced by her ambi- guity, representing simultaneously death and resurrection. The Hottentots and the Bushmen, for instance, worship the mantis as a celestial divinity that was swallowed by a Devouring God but then vomited out alive, thereby connected to rebirth and nourishment. In some Bushmen myths the mantis is killed, disintegrates, but comes back to life, similar to the vision of the Dry Bones or the myths of Osiris and Dionysos.23 The myth of the disintegrated mantis correlates to another motif in Surrealist art-the disinte- grating woman, an image that recurs in many of Dalf 's paintings. In, for example, The Specter of Sex Appeal (1934; Dalif Foundation), Dalf finds a new sexual attrac- tion in what he calls "the spectral capacity of women"-"their possible dissociation, their lumi- nous charnel decomposition."'24 .? ?,??? ?1~ ;.. r;; O~1C~i/4~i~rP~~:;il ::::ri i-' c;.? i" 'r .???*; ?: ? ?.r'. rr ~;; ..?. . : : .t .

Berizzi. 0 WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="3">In many cultures the mantis is associated with teeth, both as a cure for toothache and as a symbol of nutrition and digestion. Because the mantis eats her sex-partner, the teeth have come to symbolize both cannibalism and castration. Represented by a mouth filled with threatening fangs or with a toothed vagina de- signed to castrate any penetrator, she becomes Surrealism's other main trope, the vagina dentata. Ties between maturity and teeth are evident in many cultures and often find expression in initiation ceremonies. Caillois claims that in primitive cultures that do not practice circumcision as a rite of passage, maturity is celebrated by the removal of a tooth.25 If the tooth represents a state of immaturity, in which one fears be- ing swallowed up and drawn back into the unconscious, the re- moval of the tooth represents a confrontation with this fear and the acquisition of awareness. Some North American Indian tribes believe that a sharp-toothed, meat-eating fish resides in the vagina of the Terrible Mother. He who breaks and removes the teeth from the vagina (thereby turning the "terrible woman" into a "real woman") is a hero. In other tribal myths, the breaking of the vagi- nal teeth is an expression of manhood.26 In Ernst's Joy of Life, near the mantis couple is the head of a snake (or a lizard) with a mouthful of teeth that clearly represents the vagina dentata. Its closeness to the couple creates a connection be- tween their coitus and the castration complex, a cynical and macabre reminder of the link between eroticism and death also suggested in the title. Ernst's Berenice (1935; Piero Chiantelassa, Turin), based on a tale by Edgar Allen Poe, reveals an even clearer link to the vagina dentata. Egaeus, Berenice's suitor, became haunted by the image of her teeth. When she was reported dead he went to her tomb, and in a trancelike state he extracted her teeth. Only after he awoke did he realize that she was not dead but in a deep trance.27 Vagina dentata images also appear in many works by Picasso, mostly from the twenties, when he was in close contact with the Surrealists and somewhat influenced by them.2" He used the mouth full of teeth and the vagina dentata as ambivalent images as early as 1927.2 Bust of a Woman with Self-Portrait (1929; Fig. 2) expresses his attitude toward women through her teeth. Paintings such as Nude on a White Background (1927) and Large Nude in a Red Armchair (1929), both at the Musie Picasso, Paris, depict an oval, tooth-filled mouth in an abstract woman's face. The vertical oval more closely resembles the aperture of a vagina than a mouth. This shape recurs in his 1928-29 series of paintings showing the artist and his model in the studio. Pierre Daix claims that the paintings of this period reflect the violence of Picasso's domestic situation, and that Picasso had created an ideogram of the face of his wife Olga, which was "un- doubtedly drawn from the image she presented as she screamed invectives at her husband.'"30 This ideogram was composed of an- gular shapes, stiff locks of hair like the teeth of a comb, and a mouth filled with threatening teeth. Between 1928 and 1931 Picasso (with the help of Gonzilez) created a series of iron sculptures as models for a monument to Apollinaire. The sharp, angular shapes of"Olga's ideogram" fit the jagged and aggressive character of this material, as can be seen in Woman in Garden (1929-30; Musie Picasso, Paris).3' A more di- rect connection between teeth and the mantis can be detected in Picasso's Seated Bather (1930; MOMA, New York), in which the figure appears as an anthropomorphized combination of insect and crab, possessing a bony jaw with pincer-claws, and filled, once again, with threatening teeth. In some of Picasso's paintings, for example, The Kiss (1931; Fig. 3), the sharp-toothed osculaters (male and female) seem to be de- vouring each other.

The Kiss also rede- fines the sex roles. As the male and the female devour each other, they are equally in danger of being swallowed up (or castrated). This interpretation contradicts those classical psychoanalysts who claim that fear of castration is a formative part of the male defini- tion of gender, with the female the castrator.3" Barbara Walker claims that the vagina dentata is not derived from the fear of cas- tration, attacking this attitude as a patriarchal corruption of earlier myths. Walker argues that the mouth of the vagina represents both male and female fears: the fear of being swallowed up by the mouth of the earth, an unwillingness to cede one's individuality to death.33 Thus, Picasso, in The Kiss, liberates the woman from her role as the sole aggressor. AIthough the works of many Surrealist artists are informed by the multiple images of the mantis in relation to mim6tisme and vagina dentata, works by Dali and Giacometti are used here as examples of two different approaches to the ambivalent female ar- chetype that the mantis represents. Neumann argues that a man who fears woman (seen as the vagina dentata) has not yet reached maturity, still seeing himself as a vulnerable phallus rather than an independent entity.) For such a man, masturbation provides an escape from sexual intercourse and protects him from possible castration.'5 This idea is evident in some of Dali's paintings, especially The Great Masturbator (1929; Fig. 4), in which the amorphous shape that fills the canvas is actu- ally the artist's self-portrait face down, with a grasshopper for a mouth.6 The head of Gala Eluard, Dali's lover and later his wife, grows out of the nape of his neck; her mouth is positioned at the crotch of a standing man, who is seen only up to his loins. The male phallus is neither exposed nor erect, and Gala's mouth is shut and therefore (temporarily) not threatening. The Great Masturbator was created just before the marriage of Gala and Dali and may represent Dali's anxieties about his future with her.37 Whitney Chadwick, although explaining the ambiva- lence of Dali's attitude toward Gala, describes her in this painting as heroine-savior.? And indeed, Gala saved Dali from the attacks of paralyzing laughter that prevented him from working and gave him a sense of reality and equilibrium. But their relationship was complicated and problematic, as Gala was married to Eluard when SPRING / SUMMER 2000</page><page sequence="4">~~U Fig. 5.

Dalf did not, apparently, feel entirely comfortable; he was both distressed by the fact that he had taken his friend's wife, and he also feared that she would take advantage of his boundless love and swallow him up entirely. Gala evoked the conflict be- tween his fear of impotence and his strong erotic urges."9 The "great masturbator," then, is actually Dalf himself, who fears being castrated by Gala; and Gala, who is both loved and feared, is the mantis, or in this painting, the grasshopper. Dalf was among the Surrealists invited to Eluard's house to ob- serve the mating rites of the mantes. Despite his fascination with these insects, clearly evident in his writing, he never painted them. Instead, he chose to paint a grasshopper, which he loaded with the symbolism associated with the mantis. On various occasions, he identified the insect as a grasshopper, a locust, even a mantis.40 Dali often wrote poems to accompany his paintings, which he con- sidered parallel works of art. Although the poems usually preced- ed the paintings, the poem for The Great Masturbator, written afterward, referred to the insect as "locust."4' In the painting, the grasshopper-locust clings to the lower part of Dali's face, where his mouth should have been. It should be noted that a mouth substitute had appeared a year earlier, in Dali's and Luis Buhiuel's film Un Chien Andalou (1928), in which the mouth of the "cyclist" is transformed into a kind of a membrane, as in the painting and the poem ("While the membrane which cov- ers his mouth completely"42) and then covered with hair. The ges- ture of the actress suggests that the hair comes from her armpit, but it also looks like pubic hair.43 According to Dali, the most threatening element in The Great Masturbator is the grasshopper, which aroused many associations with his childhood, some real, some imaginary.4 It brought back the fear of being swallowed up, born from a deep-rooted fear of his father, a strict notary whom Dali feared as a Saturn devouring his children.49 The grasshopper also was used by Dali to represent pleasant memories."4 Connected to his anxiety about being eaten or castrated, there is little doubt that the grasshopper endowed with mantis qualities also represents Gala. This interpretation is verified by another painting, Portrait of Paul Eluard (1929), which Dalf started when Gala was still Eluard's wife, although by the time it was finished she had left him.4' Here, Eluard holds the grasshopper, while Dalf"s face appears in the background. The not-so-holy trinity of Dali, Eluard, and the grasshopper-mantis reinforces the claim that the latter represents Gala, both as a symbol of adultery and as the enveloping relation- ship that Dali is about to enter. The phallic shape of the grasshopper in both The Great Masturbator and Portrait of Paul Eluard could al- Fig. 6. Alberto Giacometti, Woman with Her Throat Cut (1932, cast 1949), bronze, 34/2" long.

Caillois points out that Dali, in his comments on Millet's L'Angilus, intuitively understood the connection between sexuality and eating and be- tween love and the desire to consume the beloved." And indeed, just as he feared being swallowed, he also feared his cannibalistic impulse-the desire to swallow up others. Dali discussed this in an article on the modern style in architecture, in which he claimed that Art Nouveau had aroused people's imagination to the extent that they wanted to devour the object of their fantasies and love.5' This lust acquires greater significance in Dali's essay on the Surrealist object, where he concludes that our relationship with the object is divided into four stages. In the fourth stage, he writes, "the object tends to bring about our fusion with it and makes us pursue the formation of a unity with it (hunger for an ar- ticle and edible articles).""5 Cannibalism, as a wish to unify with the object of our love, could also explain Dali's idea about the sex- ual appeal of the edible woman. For Giacometti, a confrontation with the negative female ar- chetype, rooted in his complex relationship with his mother, led him to create an absolute division between the "saint" and the "whore." He admitted that he suffered from impotence and could reach satisfaction only with prostitutes."5 The Surrealists intro- duced Giacometti to Freud's writings even before he became a member of the group, and by the late 1920s he set out on a quest of self-discovery, a sort of self-psychoanalysis, externalizing his in- nate violence toward women. Rather than escaping direct contact with women via masturba- tion, as did Dali, Giacometti attacked. Like the mythical hero or the mature man who had experienced ceremonial initiation, he turned upon the dreaded vagina dentata, breaking its teeth with his toothed phallus. Disagreeable Object (1931; Fig. 5) is such a phallus, an antithesis to the vagina dentata. Here it is the male or- gan that threatens to mutilate the female. This disagreeable object marked a necessary stage in his path to maturity: he replaced es- capism and impotence with angry assault. In Woman with Her Throat Cut (1932; Fig. 6), Giacometti uses the mantis image in a particularly violent way. The woman, with many mantislike features, lies outstretched upon the floor. At the end of her particularly long throat, slit in the middle, is a tiny head with an open mouth, as though gasping for one last breath. The body of the woman-mantis is split into two jagged, toothlike parts, 0 WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="5">which lie on either side of a spinal cohmln.

The mantes belong to the Dictyoptera, and the cricket, locust, and grasshopper to the Orthoptera. The Surrealists used images of several Orthoptera, which they endowed with connotations associated only with the mantis. 2.

The title given to Brassai"'s photograph (a detail from Guimard's entrance to the Metro in Paris) was: "II s'agit en- core d'un atavisme m6talique de I'Angelus de Millet." See Dawn Ades, "Photography and the Surrealist Text," L'Amour Fou, 179. 9. Robert Belton mentions two books that contributed to the fashionable analogies between human and insect behavior: R6my de Gourmont's Physique de I'Amour: Essai sur I'instinct sexual (Paris: Mercure de France, 1903; reprint 1920), in which he compared human sexual practice to that of animals; and the 10-volume half-scientific, half-poetic Souvenirs entomol- gies by J. H. Fabre, published in Paris in 1924-25, in which Fabre claimed that sexual instinct is the most primitive and therefore the most natural.

Caillois, "La Mante religieuse," 23. 12. Ibid., 25. Belton suggests that Eluard and Breton kept the mantis "to remind themselves of an ever-present danger in their own relationships with women"; see his "Edgar Allen Poe," 8. 13. Georges Bataille, "De 1'6rotisme, il est possible de dire qu'il est I'ap- probation de la vie jusque dans la mort," in L'Erotisme (Paris: Les Editions de Minuit, 1957), 17. 14. On the influence of George Bataille on Masson, see Doris A. Bir- mingham, "Masson's Pasipha6: Eros and the Unity of the Cosmos," Art Bulletin (June 1987), 291. See also Pressly, "The Praying Mantis," 607-11. Masson illustrated several issues of Bataille's short-lived journal Acephale (1936-37), the title referring to animals with no heads, like the decapitated male mantis. 15. AndrB Breton, "What is Surrealism?" in Herschel B. Chipp, ed., Theories of Modern Art (Berkeley: University of California, 1975), 414. This was said in a lecture given in Brussels on June 1, 1936, and issued as a pamphlet immediately afterward. An excerpt, translated into English by David Gascon, appears in Andr6 Breton, What is Surrealism? (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1936), 9-24. 16. Caillois, "La Mante religieuse," 26, and "Mim6tisme et psychas- th6nie 16gendaire," 5-10. 17. Belton noted that Ernst revealed the image of the mantis even in paintings that were produced "automatically," like Hunger Feast (1935); see his "Edgar Allen Poe," 8. 18. Caillois, "La Mante religieuse," 26; see also Krauss, "Corpus De- licti," 74. 19. Caillois, "La Mante religieuse," 26, and Krauss, "Corpus Delicti," 74. Bataille also argues that we seek infinity by eradicating the trappings of individuality; see Pressly, "Praying Mantis in Surrealist Art," 608. Bataille, drawing comparisons between death and eroticism, claims that the sensation of eradicating individuality can be reached via extreme sexu- al ecstasy or violence; see his L'5rotisme, 19. 20.

In the prophet Ezekiel's vision, God transformed the Dry Bones into living beings to symbolize the revival of the people of Israel and their return to their land. The Egyptian god Osiris was murdered by his brother Set. His body was cut to pieces and spread all over the country, but his wife, the goddess Isis, collected the pieces and reassembled the body and was able to conceive with him their child Horus. The newborn Greek god Dionysos, child of Zeus and Semele, was torn to shreds by order of Hera, Zeus's legitimate wife, but was res- cued and reconstituted by his grandmother, Rhea. Bataille was the first to notice that mutilation and destruction are characteristics of primitive art as well; see his Oeuvres Complete, I (Paris: Gallimard, 1970), 247-54. 24.

Such shapes were also common at that time in the sculpture of Gonz61lez and Giacometti. On Picasso and Apollinaire and on Picasso's work on the models for the monument, see Peter Read, Picasso et Apollinaire, Les MBtamorphoses de la MBmoire 1905/1973 (Paris: Edition Jean Michel Place, 1995). 32. Belton concludes in "Edgar Allen Poe," 8, 9-10. 33. Walker, "vagina dentata," in Woman's Encyclopedia, 1034-37; see also her entry on "castration," 142-47. 34. Neumann, The Great Mother, 168. 35. Belton explains that sexual reproduction necessarily involves male loss of erection, and the male, who sees himself chiefly as an embodiment of his phallus, accepts it as a loss (as a "little death," as Bataille would put it); see in his "Andr6 Masson "Earth-Mothers," 54. We may assume that the masturbator believes that he controls the act, and at the same time he avoids the shame of being defeated by the female. 36. A similar, and more accurate profile, also with a grasshopper for a mouth, is depicted in Dali's The Lugubrious Game (1929). 37. Pressly refers to Gala in this painting as "his wife to be"; see his "The Praying Mantis," 605. 38. Whitney Chadwick, Women Artists and the Surrealist Movement (Boston: Little, Brown, 1985), 37. 39.

Another Dali and Buhuel film, L'age d'or, contains a scene that resembles The Great Masturbator. See Rudolf E. Kuenzli, "Surrealism and Misogyny," in Mary Ann Caws, Rudolf E. Kuenzli, and Gwen Raaberg, eds., Surrealism and Woman (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1991), 19. 44. Rubin, Dada and Surrealism, 220. 45. The 37-year-old Dali admitted that the fright that the grasshopper caused him had not yet diminished; see his The Secret Life of Salvador Dali, 128. 46. See Rubin, Dada and Surrealism, 213-30, and Pressly, "The Praying Mantis," 601-07. 47. Since it symbolizes the same fear-that of being swallowed-the grasshopper-mantis, for Dali, represented both his father and Gala. 48. Gilles NBret, Salvador Dali (K61n: Benedikt Taschen, 1994), 21. 49. Since the grasshopper is the image of Dali's father, it could equally suggest a fight between Dali's id and his super-ego, chastising him for immorality. 50. Caillois, "La Mante religieuse," 25. 51. Salvador Dali, "De La beaut6 terrifiante et comestible," 69-76; Pressly, "The Praying Mantis," 602. The details from Guimard's pho- tographs of M6tro entrances create an association between decorative flo- ral shapes and human sexual organs and, at the same time, resemble the mantis; see Ades, "Photography and the Surrealist Text," 179. 52. Salvador Dali, "The object as revealed in Surrealist experiment," in Chipp, ed., Theories of Modern Art, 417-27. Dali was probably influenced by Freud, who claimed that "the act of eating is a destruction of the object with the final aim of incorporating it"; see Freud's "The Theory of the Instincts," 149. Rubin argues that the roots of Dali's cannibalism can be found in his childhood, in the sacrament of the Eucharist. The Catholic believer, who eats the Host and drinks the wine, unites momentarily with the body of Christ and becomes one with the Deity; see Dada and Surrealism, 230. 53.
