<plain_text><page sequence="1">Erwin R. Goodenough: By Light, Light. The mystic gospel of Hellenistic Judaism. New Haven: Yale University Press; London: Milford 1935. XV, 436 S. 5 $. Professor Goodenough, who has made a number of valuable con tributions to our knowledge of Hellenistic and Christian thought, here presents a remarkable study of certain of Philo's ideas: God as the Absolute, connected with phenomena by a series of abstractions or powers; a Higher Law behind and above the specific injunctions of the Torah ; a lower way of spiritual endeavor, symbolized in a mystery of Aaron, and a higher way, symbolized in a mystery of Moses; the Patriarchs as animate laws and types of virtues ; Moses as the supreme hero of the men of vision and as himself divine Logos. Goodenough takes literally Philo's references to a Mystery of Moses and is inclined to postulate an actual cult : he finds traces of this in earlier Hellenistic Judaism, and an exemplification in the prayers from Const. Apost. 7 which Bousset identified as Jewish. A promised second volume is to treat the pictures found in the synagogue at Dura. Philo was, as Goodenough argues, no isolated thinker, but a striking representative of a tradition which goes back to the Sapiential litera ture, and which did not die with him1). Further, he was primarily religious rather than philosophical, and nearer to Paul than to Posi donius ; and his type of piety is of the utmost importance for the under standing of the evolution of Christianity2). The new religion's early contacts with Hellenistic Judaism came before its contacts with Helle nistic paganism, and were far more intimate, and I suspect that of the two they had far more immediate consequences; they at once facilitated rationalizations of what the early disciples felt about Jesus x) Cf. H. Odeberg, 3 Enoch. 2) Cf. G. p. 205 on Qu. Ex. 1, 10, where Moses is represented as making the Jews an ecclesia. Goodenough rightly stresses the bearing of Philo's thought on Christology.</page><page sequence="2">A. D. Nock: Goodenough, By Light, Light 157 and the Kingdom. G. says much that is most illuminating in this direction, and since the rest of this review must be devoted to cri ticism, let me here express my deep and sincere gratitude to him for one of the most stimulating of recent books. On the other hand, he seems to me less happy in his treatment of the relation of Philo's ideas to contemporary paganism. When he connects the Philonic 'powers' with the Iranian Amesha Spentas, he may well be right. But when he follows Reitzenstein and Pascher in urging a connection of the Logos-Sophia complex and other things with the Egyptian mysteries and the Herm?tica, he seems to me to be on less secure ground; and when (with reservations) he postulates Graeco-Jewish cult mysteries1), embodying Philo's ideas, he seems to me definitely wrong. The comparison of Philo's piety with the Egyptian mysteries turns: (1) on Plutarch's Isis and Osiris (and in particular on the symbolic significance there attached to the dress of Isis and that of Osiris, which has a close analogy to Philo's allegorization of the garments of the high priest and some analogy to his contrast of Aaron and Moses ; and on the allegorical interpretation of the impregnation of Isis by Osiris as a fecundation of matter by mind); and (2) on the 'deification' of Moses and (in a solemn ritual moment) of the high priest. The similarities to Plutarch are striking. But there is no reason to believe that initiates wTere taught anything like what Plutarch says. Good initiates told but little ? not very much even when they became Christians; and what had they to tell? The statements of Macrobius, Sat. 1, 7, 18 nom occultas et manantes ex meri ueri fonte rationes ne in ipsis guidem sacris enarrari permitti tur, sed si quis illas adsequitur, continere intro conscienliam tedas iubetur, and Comm. in somn. Scip. 1, 2, 18 sed summations tantum uiris sapientia interprete ueri arcani consciis contenu sint reliqui ad uenerationem figuris defendentibus a uilitate secretum are confirmed by all our scanty evidence. The pious initiate could and would meditate on the experience which had been his2). Plutarch says (Isis 3, p. 352 C) 'the true Isiac is he who, when he has duly received the things shown and done in reference to these deities, searches them by reason and philosophizes on the truth contained in them'. Men turned to mysteries, like Apuleius, studio ueri, but they took this nerum with them, or got it from books or talk. Goodenough says (p. 1) 'The mystery is not a path to Isis or Attis; it is a path to Reality, Existence, Knowledge, Life, of which Isis or Attis is the symbol. The value of Isis, that is, to make the intellectual concept emo tionally realizable, something which can be taken out of the cold words of for mulation and made radiantly alive within the longing hearts of mankind', but we must for 'mankind' substitute 'people like Plutarch ?- who was pro x) As earlier F.

Apuleius, who after all fancied himself as a philosopher, puts nothing so elevated in Met. 11, although it seems that he could not have felt under bonds of secrecy in regard to things available in Plutarch and other literature. His whole account treats the ini tiations as rites, changing the religious status of Lucius : the repetition of the Isiac initiation at Rome emphasizes this2). Further, except for the interpretation of the sacred garments, which could be seen when dedicated in the temples and when worn by an initiate coming forward to receive the adoration of all and sundry, what Plutarch says relates to the myth and not to the mysteries as such : and it was not the only interpretation, not even the only interpretation known to him. Elsewhere in this treatise and in other works he gives 'the physical interpretation'3), even of the mysteries. In his Eroticus 17 p. 762 A, an interlocutor says 'there are some slight and dim traces of the truth scattered in the mythological tales of the Egyptians, but they need a clever sleuth who can seize on great things with small means' ; ? that is to say, they are not to be elicited save by such exegesis as Philo applies to the Pentateuch. Of course, such interpretations were acceptable to some of the votaries of these cults, as we see from P. Oxy. 1381. 170ff., where a cosmogony written according to the cpvoix?? X?yo? is mentioned in a religious context. This development may have been aided by the fact that one man of learning, L. Julius Vestinus, occupied the Alexan drian high priesthood and the scholar Chaeremon could hold high priestly office. Nevertheless, Otto has shown that the Hellenistic literature about Egyptian religion came in the main from lay Greeks4). Jewish allegory was in all probability drawing on Graeco-Egyptian learning rather than on Graeco Egyptian religious tradition. The mysteries, like Judaism and Christianity, were in themselves nonphilosophical and, if they were to be intellectually ac ceptable at the time, had a like need of the application of philosophical terms and concepts5). On the question of deification, Goodenough does not follow Pascher, but refers to the view held by Pythagorean and other philosophers concerning x) Lobeck, Aglaophamus 123if., on the Eleusinian mysteries is still note worthy. 2) In general Goodenough does not seem, to grasp the more normal aspects of ancient paganism. It is not well to tell us (p. 4) 'Socrates died in Orphic hope', to use the Orphic hymns (17ff.) for the conceptions lying behind Orphism in the Hellenistic age, to translate 0gvyirj? a reiga (18) as 'the Phrygian Savior', and to say (109 n. 62) 'on sacramental use of negi? ua see Plutarch Aemil. Paul., XXX, iii, 1' (should be xxxiii, 2 and is used simply of the aprons worn by the youths who led the sacrificial victims; i.e. limus). 3) Cf. Th. Hopfner, Fontes historiae religionis Aegyptiacae 260ff. I would add that the Isis of popular piety was not so passive as the Isis of some of Plutarch's explanations. (It should be noted that allegory is found in native Egyptian thought; cf. A. H. Gardiner, Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum,, Third Series, 1, 2ff. for Osiris called 'Truth' and Seth 'Falsehood', and ibid. 31, 33, 86, n. 4.) 4) Priester und Tempel 2, 217 f. 5) [Among the mysteries, Mithraism had the largest possibilities; cf. my forthcoming remarks in JRS. 1937.]</page><page sequence="4">A.

After all, what is said of the high priest refers to an office mystically conceived and not to a man sacrament ally trans formed and the heroes of Judaism could not but seem to stand somewhere be tween man and God. Philo does show scruples about the idea of man becom ing as God2), and yet he is familiar with immortalization in the metaphorical sense used by philosophy ? i.e. a transcending of the lower self and a rising to the highest possibility open to men, which is the being more than man3). Even this could find some slight foothold in Scripture4), and in the world at large it was used far beyond the circle of the mysteries, e.g. in describing what was felt about rnagnae animae, and also the effects on the ordinary man of the enjoyment of love5), or of the work of a master cook6), or of magic7). A difficult problem is raised by the description of the calling of Moses to the mountain in Qu. Ex. 2, 46 as a second birth, better than the first, and as a divine birth. Here Philo may, as Schaeder allows8), be thinking of the idea of rebirth as presented in the mystery-religions. But is there not an alternative ? Rebirth is a natural metaphor for a new phase of life on a new plane. So we find it of the man introduced to Vedic doctrine, of the performer of Brahmanic sacrifice, of the Jewish proselyte; to teach the son of another the Jewish Law was to become, as it were, his begetter9). For a special divine birth there was perhaps a specific origin. Ps. 2. 7, vio? uov el ov, ?y afjuegov yey?vvrjx? ae* when written, probably referred to a metaphorical sonship which began with the king's coronation or enthronement10). We know the place of this text in the story of the Baptism of Jesus11). Jewish exegesis found in it a variety of Messianic connotations12). The underlying concept may well be rooted in other Oriental ideas of kingship13), but it had been absorbed in the Jewish world of thought, as a pregnant expression of a national dream. If Philo has this text in mind, he does not say so outright, but in these Questions he does not seem to quote passages from the O. T. other than those which he is interpreting; he is writing for Jews' who might have such imagery in their minds. I see the difficulties of this interpretation, but they seem to me less great than those of the other14). If Philo had been thinking of anything like the mysteries, would he not have explored the possibilities of a diuina natiuitas for all the men of *) Cf. now L.

Ex. 2, 29, he applies the metaphor of initiation to the prophetic intellect alone: later (2, 51) he promises to the individual soul that a worthy initiation and consecration will lead to the vision of God, but he makes it clear that the requisite is that man should make his soul a worthy tabernacle. In De virtutibus 7. 6 the transformation to an immortal life is gradual, as the body's insistence wanes. In any case, the mysteries clearly promised happiness after death; to Philo, as H. Windisch remarks (Die Fr?m migkeit Philos, 100), this idea, though it is occasionally mentioned, was not at all important. Philo's doctrine of impregnation is a hard matter, and I do not pretend to understand it. Nevertheless, we have to remember, here as elsewhere, that some of the strangest features in his allegories arise from the actual phrasing of the O.T. as he read it in Greek2). The alternation between Logos and Sophia is, as Schwartz saw, due to an equation of the Logos of Gen. 1 with the Sophia of Prov. 8, 27ff.3); and the curious idea of the masculine properties of feminine abstractions seems due to this and to the natural idea of the 'initiate' as re ceptive and passive4). The notion of a restoration of virginity to the soul by divine fecundation seems peculiar to Philo and may spring from his personal tendency to value anything ascetic. We now come to the crucial question. Were there communities with something like a mystery of Aaron and a mystery of Moses, with a sacred meal and an initiatory ceremony of rebirth ? To answer with a downright negative may seem dangerous. It is after all possible, is it not, that proselyte baptism might by some be invested with addi tional solemnity, or that the kiddush might in some groups acquire special significance by being put into relation with the manna given in the desert; and did not Philo interpret the manna (Quis rerum 79), as 'the divine Logos, the heavenly imperishable nourishment of the soul eager for vision' or (De mut. nom. 259) as 'heavenly wisdom' or (Leg. alleg. 3. 173) as God's own utterance and Logos5) ? 1) In Conf. ling. 146 he speaks of 'not yet being worthy to be called a son of God'; worthiness is to be won by moral endeavor (which has excellent Jewish precedent: Strack-Billerbeck 3, 16f.). He does not speak of a condition of non-sonship, from which one passes by a mystery to one of sonship. For God's metaphorical fatherhood cf. Leg. all. 3. 219. Perhaps the rebirth in Corp. Herrn. 13 is an individual application of something like the Philonic concept; this might explain the title ?v ogei k?yo? ?noxgvcpo? and the phrase ?nl xfj? xov ogov? uexa?doe ? (Reitzenstein coni. xaxa??oe ?). 2) Cf. H. Drexler in this journal 8, 1932, 156ff. 3) The Hebrew corresponding to ?v ?g%fj was interpreted by the Jerusa lem Targum as 'by wisdom' (C. H. Dodd, The Bible and the Greeks, 109). I should here remark that the Herm?tica are evidence for speculative theosophic piety and not for the mysteries ; they show at times antipathy to popular cultas (Corp. Herrn. 4, 7; 12, 23; Ascl. 41). 4) For metaphorical pregnancy cf. Plat. Symp. p. 206. 5) Cf. Pascher, K?nigsweg, 184ff. for other parallels, notably Quaest.

Nock: Goodenough, By Light, Light 161 Certainly, mystery language?preliminary purification, initiation in its stages, secrecy before the uninitiated?is very common and very emphatic in Philo. Thus, in a fragment (Mangey 2. 658f.; J. R. Harris 75) discussed by Goodenough (260ff.), Philo says that it is strange that civic law forbids the revealing of ?btvaxtx? ?uvaxrjgta, and yet the true teletai are unveiled to the wicked; those who would share in them should reject idolatry and embrace piety, should be purified in body and soul through the laws and customs of the fathers, and should furnish a reliable pledge that they are worthy of welcome 'in order that they may not, after partaking from a holy table, like intemperate youths, be changed by fullness and satiety, insulting like wanton drunkards things that should not be so treated'1). Our memories of 1 Cor. 11 make the last sentence very suggestive. And yet, in view of the considera tions which follow, it must be pure metaphor. The sustenance is the teaching, but Philo, having introduced the metaphor of a meal, is carried on by the metaphor to envisage and depict the results of wrong par ticipation in the mysteries in terms of the effects of incautious enjoy ment of the pleasures of the table. In any case, he implies quite clearly that the teletai which should be guarded were being divulged; that is to say, the treasures of Judaism were being cast like pearls before swine. There are several basic objections to Goodenough's theory. (1) The ceremony for the reception of proselytes, which included a baptism, could not be applied to what would have been the chief source of recruits for a 'Philonic group'?namely Jews who had come to adopt this new and deeper view of their religion. (2) Philo sketches what he regards as two ideal forms of Jewish existence when he describes the Therapeutai in De uita contemplatiua and the Essenes in Quod omnis probus liber 75ff. and in a fragment ap. Euseb. P. E. 8, 11, 1?18. How could he here fail at least to allude to cultus of the type of his mysteries if it existed in such circles ? And yet all he has to tell us of the Therapeutai is that each had in his habitation a sacred room 'which is called a holy place and a monasterion in which in solitude they are initiated in the mysteries of the holy life, bringing in nothing .. . save the laws and the oracles spoken through the prophets and hymns and the other things by which knowledge and piety are brought to increase and perfection'. These habitations were for individuals and the chapels resemble those in the little houses of the Camaldolese. The men soul, true participation in life, and the cause of immortality). These ideas make sense of Joh. 6, 32ff. ; Christianity gave direct personal content to them, for the words of institution at the Last Supper needed explanation. *) Goodenough mistranslates. He raises the question whether it is pos sible for Philo to be alluding here to the Paschal meal, which could apparently be celebrated only in Jerusalem: but note I. Heinemann, Philons griechische u. j?dische Bildung 518 on Philo's constant references to sacrifice which also was legitimate only in Jerusalem. Gnomon 1937 H</page><page sequence="7">162 Gnomon 1937 were 'initiated'; yes, but there was only God to initiate them1). They offered prayer at dawn and at sunset, they studied the scriptures and interpreted them allegorically, they read writings of the founders of the sect, and they composed hymns. But they met only on the Sabbath for a sermon and every seven weeks for a sermon and hymn, a simple and solemn meal, a vigil, hymns and dances which Philo sets in relation with the crossing of the Red Sea, and a final prayer at sunrise. No esoteric significance is attached to the meal and there is no word of a rite of admission; people entered the group and took rank by senior ity; the spirit of the whole, as of early Egyptian monasticism, is one of the individualistic quest of salvation. For the Essenes Philo tells us of a Sabbath service, reading of the scriptLire, and allegorical interpretation aided by inspi ration. (3) The condemnation of private mysteries in De specialibus legibus 1. 319ff. cannot be explained away. (4) What Philo means by initiation is made clear by De cherubim 49: 'for under Moses, the friend of God, I was initiated in the great mysteries, and yet thereafter when I came to see the prophet Jeremiah and to recognize that he was not only an initiate, but also a competent hierophant, I did not shrink from going to his school: and he, being often in a state of inspiration, uttered in the name of God an oracle which says this . . .'. The experience is purely solitary, personal, individual, like the apprehension of philosophic truth as described by Plato Ep. 7 p. 341 C and Plut. Is. 77 p. 382 D?E2). This is confirmed by De sacrificiis Abelis etCaini60: 'it is well that these three measures (Gen. 18. 6) should be as it were, kneaded and fused in the soul in order that, being persuaded of the existence of God who is above all, God who has trans cended his Powers, being both seen apart from them and visible in them, it may receive the impress of his might and benevolence and, having become initiated in the highest rites, may not tell the mysteries readily to any one, but treasure them up and guard them in silent secrecy'. Revelation and ecstasy revealed these truths to the select few : the unwise and unworthy are ipso facto excluded from participation. Philo's ideal man lives the life of Judaism, faithful and orthodox, like Philo himself, who went to Rome as one of the chosen re presentatives of his people in Alexandria; but he hugs his precious secret. The hierophants are no ecclesiastical officials; they are Moses and the prophets and the men whom God has taught; and the secret is, as in the Fourth Gospel, an eternal life here and now3). (5) Goodenough is right in stressing the community of spirit which exists between Philo and the Jewish prayers in Const. Apost., although these lack the subtle elaboration of Philo. Nevertheless, apart from directions for the? instruction of neophytes (frag. 2. p. 326 G.) the elements which can with some confidence be regarded as substantively Jewish are no more than a development i) Cf. Plotin. 6. 9, 11. 2) The baptism in Corp. Herrn. 1, the rebirth in 13 may be derivative developments. Certain magical proceedings show the attempt to give concrete satisfaction to similar aspirations; cf. Nock, JEA. 15, 1929, 230ff. 3) Philo's idea of a continuous unfolding of God's purpose and unveiling of his secrets helps us to understand Paul's constant reference to the uvarfjgiov now disclosed ? perhaps also Mt. 11, 25?26.</page><page sequence="8">A.

On the pictures in the Dura synagogue we must await Goodenough's promised treatment2); what is noted provisionally, p. 209f., does not seem capable of bearing any weight of hypothesis : we see knowledge of Midrashic tradition, but that proves nothing in the way of a mystery3). The reader may well ask; why then does Philo lay such great and such frequent stress on what is only a metaphor of initiation ? Similar language, if less elaborate, than Philo's4), was often used by philosophers ?e.g. Aristotle, Chrysippus, Seneca. Further, the metaphor was, for a Greek philosopher and for Philo alike, no mere ornamental trick of style. It had great inherent appropriateness. The initiate, the philo sopher, the Jew, each had something which he believed to be of incom parable, irreplaceable value, making him who received and possessed *) I doubt Goodenough's enlargement of the range of Jewish material in this section. Can his Fragment IX (p. 329 from Const. Apost. 8, 6.) be Jewish ? ?cp?ae ? xv%ovxe? x v nkrjuuekrjudx v ?i? xfj? uvfjoe ? does not to me seem possible in Hellenistic Judaism,. Its God forgave sins freely to the repentant (cf. H. Windisch, Die Fr?mmigkeit Philos, 108); and IX is crucial for Goode nough (cf. pp. 351, 353). Fragment XIV is closely related to the Didache prayer and likely to be based on that rather than on a common Jewish original. The thought of Frag. XV (from 8. 16) is in the tradition of Hellenistic Judaism, but what reason is there for supposing that the phrases quoted by Goodenough ever had an existence apart from the whole prayer in which they are found ? E. Peterson, Z. kath. Theol. 58, 1934, HOff. has shown that the Schma was copied in Christian morning prayer in Syria; ib. 400ff. that e?? ?eo? in Syrian epitaphs is probably due to Jewish funerary custom. 2) [Cf. in the meanwhile Goodenough, I. Bibl. lit. 55, 1936, 211 ff., and for the paintings, Excavations at Dura-Europos, VI Rep. 337 ff. where C. N. Kraeling discusses them.] 3) O. Casel, Jb. f. Liturgiewissenschaft, 12, 40f., has made a contrast between the historical style of these pictures and the symbolic style of those in the early Christian church at Dura. (The earlier synagogue found under the great one had only geometric wall-designs. Clark Hopkins, AJA. 39, 1935, 293.) There is one point to add on the general question of cult mysteries. Clement of Alexandria, Strom. 1, 23 p. 95 St. says that Moses after his assump tion into heaven was named ? cpaoiv ol uvaxai, MeXyi, and also p. 96 cpaal ?? o? uvaxai koy uov ?veke?v x?v A?yvnxiov: ib. 2. 20 p. 171 he says that certain parts of victims being sacrificed were removed ?i alxia? ?? ?aaaiv o? uvaxai. The second of these three points occurs in extant Haggadic literature (S. Krauss, Jewish Quarterly Review, 5, 1893, 136f.); the other two are not different in kind. Further, in 5, 5 p. 345 the term o? uvaxai refers to those who gave the regular Pythagorean explanation for a Pythagorean symbolon: in 1. 5 p. 21 to Christians with special understanding (cf. P. Collomp, Rev. phil. 37, 1913, 41 ff.). So it means 'people in the know'. 4) Cf. Lobeck 123ff.; O. Casel, De philosophorum graecorum silentio mystico; A. J. Festugi?re, L'id?al religieux des Grecs et l'Evangile, 120ff. ; Nock, Conversion 182. The application of mystery terminology to love and to poetic inspiration is parallel. 11*</page><page sequence="9">164 Gnomon 1937 it different from other men. The rest of the world was excluded from this privilege as being impure, or by reason of inability to come to Eleusis, or through lack of the divine command of Isis, or through incapacity to meet the cost of the initiation; it was excluded again through lack of the necessary preliminary disciplines or the ability to apprehend the ultimate ideal ; it was excluded by the results of birth and by invincible ignorance1). Each of these minorities encountered at times misunder standing, hostility and contempt. The initiate and the philosopher were distinguished from the rest of humanity and among themselves there were often gradations. So there were for the Jews. Quite apart from apostates and careless men, there were on the one hand those who devoted themselves to the mastery of the Torah and to the contemplation of God's will as revealed to God's people; and there were on the other hand those who could do no more than conform to the barest rudiments. Since the exile, Jewry was always a self-conscious minority among the nations of the world; and within this self-conscious minority there was an even more self-conscious minority. The prophets had fixed that type before the exile; thereafter, we see it in some of the Psalms, and in the Hasidim, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Therapeutai. This minority was distin guished from the many not only by intellectual pursuits ? a close hard study of the Law for which the Am-ha-arez had neither time nor inclination nor ability, but also and often even more by a set of the heart, an emotional attitude, a desire to know that little more which when apprehended could be communicated to few or none. Such men, if they lived in a Greek speaking community, must become aware of a body of pagan philosophy much of which was or could be made com patible with Jewish tradition as they held it. They found among the Greeks groups of men held together by a community of ideas. These ideas included a concept of a deity not anthropomorphic, passionless but endowed, equated, or associated with providence, achieving his purpose, without soiling his hands by contact with matter, through the operation of an intermediary or inter mediaries, expecting of man worship, love, and obedience, and willing to give to man knowledge and sometimes even mystic ecstasy. They included also an emphasis on the triviality of common worldly values and advantages. Philosophers saw no detriment in what to outsiders seemed the unenviable position of being in a small uncomprehended minority ; nay rather, it was a privilege to possess the truth which could *) Of. Hellenistic Jewish discussions of how Abraham was called (W. L. Knox, Harv. Theol. Rev. 28, 1935, 55ff.).</page><page sequence="10">A. D. Nock: Goodenough, By Light, Light 165 only with difficulty be communicated to any and not at all to most. Now for thoughtful Jews truth was one and a Greek formulation which was not positively objectionable was naturally acceptable. They took unto themselves what seemed blameless elements of Pythagore anism, Platonism, and Stoicism, accepting (with reservations) even the Platonic hostility to the body; for them indeed the body was a part of man's totality but, though not positively evil, it was nevertheless dangerous. Of course, a certain measure of transformation was an inevitable consequence of the use of the Greek language, for such words as vojbio?, ?ixaioovvrj, tzlgxi?, had associations in Greek which were different from those of the multiplicity of Hebrew words which in the Septuagint they imperfectly reproduce1). The metaphor of initiation was by its philosophic usage redeemed from any undue association with idolatry; it was particularly appropri ate, inasmuch as it expressed the passive and receptive attitude of mind which Philo held to be necessary2). At the same time, when Philo attacks pagan mysteries, he shows only a theoretical knowledge of their general character (De specialibus legibus, 1, 319 ff.) and none of the detailed facts which Clement of Alexandria possessed. His con tacts are with pagan speculation, both such as gives to religious tale and practice a philosophic content and such as gives to philosophy a religious form?not with pagan rites or popular piety. From that he is as far removed as from Jewish apocalyptic. Cambridge, Mass. Arthur Darby Nock x) Thus xvgio? r v ?vvdue v in the LXX at once suggested a different kind of ?vvduei? to a man who thought in Greek (C. H. Dodd, op. cit., 17, 110f.). Philo's use of some of these words should perhaps be re-examined in the light of Dodd's analysis. 2) De somniis 1, 119; quis rerum 264. In Leg. alleg. 1, 104 we find the bad man spoken of as the man who blabs mysteries ; here a comparison with Horace Odes, 3, 2, 26, P. gr. mag. 4, 2476 (where uvarfjgia can be just 'secrets') indicates that there is nothing recondite in such a usage. The insistence on secrecy is in a measure to be connected with the desire for an atmosphere of solemnity. After all, Philo set forth these secrets for these who would read his works; yet he may have felt, like Clement of Alexandria (R. P. Casey, Harv. Theol. Rev. 18, 1925, 70) that it was undesirable that his writings should get into the hands of all and sundry, and, of course, he may have realized that the generality of mankind would be instantly repelled by them.
