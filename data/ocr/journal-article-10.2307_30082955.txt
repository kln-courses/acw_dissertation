Ratton, M.D., M.Ch., Q.C.I., Lieut.-Colonel (retired), I.M.S., Late Fellow and Examiner, Madras University, Author of " The Apocalypse, the Antichrist, and the End," " Essays on the Apocalypse." R. and T. Washbourne, Ltd. 1912. Pages xiii. 417 THE work before us is the third that the author has devoted to 't subject dear to him. The favourable re300tion of the two former books has encouraged him to develop at greater length in the present work the thesis that seems to him to best meet the difficulties that lie in the interpretation of the Apocalypse. His conclusions, in brief, are that " the Letters to the Seven Churches are predictions concerning the Seven Ages of the Church of Christ, and that the Jewish and Roman themes of the book are historic forecasts, which have come true." According to Colonel Ratton, " the Roman invasion of Judea, the Neronian persecution, and Cesar worship, were the principal subjects heavily weighing on the mind of St. John when he went to Patmos." But as the denunciation of these evils might, if understood by the enemy, be made a source of fresh tribulation to those whom it was meant to warn and console, it " needed a cypher known to the servants of God alone. . . . The symbolic style of the prophets, Isaias, Jere mias, Ezechiel, and Daniel formed a vehicle exactly suited to the occasion. . . . St. John shows great care in selecting extracts from the Q.T. with the double object of explaining the context of his book and showing forth the fulfilment of prophecies." He meant it to serve " as a continuation of the prophecy of Daniel, from the point where it broke off and was closed and sealed (Dan xii., 9)." The invasion of Judea was a sign that it was time to break the seals. " The woe trumpets of the Jewish theme lead up to the proclamation of the kingdom (xi., 15). The Book of Daniel was not concerned with the fall of the Roman Empire. It was necessary, there fore, before beginning the Roman theme, to provide another book from which to draw the thread of narrative. This is done by introducing a little open book at Chapter X. in an inter lude. . . . . . The Roman theme, as dwelling much on Coesar worship and the decline of Rome, has a closer veil of sym bolism than the rest of the book.. . . The leading character,</page><page sequence="2">1913. The Apocalypse of St. John. 329 Nero, is as strongly and clearly portrayed as is compatible with a cypher. . . . . The events predicted in the book are presented in their correct historic perspective " : Nero's per secution (vi., 9-17), the Jewish cataclysm (viii., i-ix., 12), the wars of Galba, Otho, Vitellius and Vespasian (ix., 13-21), the fall of Jerusalem (xi., 1-15), then that of the Roman Empire (xiii.-xix), and " then the thousand years of the middle ages and a glimpse of later times. Then the Day of Judgment (xx.)'' As to the composition of the book, " the visions of Revela tion are linked together from first to last, not only in subject, but in minor details, by close and accurate workmanship. . . . There is evidence in the book that St. John had some freedom in its composition. . . . The letters to the Seven Churches alone were dictated by God (italics ours). It places them on majestic heights." These extracts will show the reader the estimate formed by Col. Ratton of the composition and general purpose of the Apocalypse. It will be seen at once that the seven letters are placed in a singularly privileged position, and it will not be a matter of surprise that peculiar care and ingenuity is expended on their elucidation. The result of this study is the discovery that, in fact, these letters were never meant for the Seven Churches at all. They are neither more nor less than outline sketches of the history of the whole Church. " It is generally ac300ted that the history of the Church, as it lies before us, falls naturally into seven divisions, each having its special characteristics." The choice of names was dictated partly by geographical considerations, partly by the symbolism of their meanings. The obscurity of most of the Seven Churches was a positive advantage. " The chief thing to be avoided in warning the Churches of the future was to give them names that would rivet attention on local Churches. . . . If the local Churches named were to ork out a record unlike that of Revelation addressed to them, and were to be extinguished in the Middle Ages, that would be an additional advantage." Accordingly, the commentary on the text of the Letters is at pains to show that what St. John says of the Church he is addressing was never verified in the local Christian community, but was marvellously fulfilled in that stage of the history of the Universal Church which is typified by it. Ephesus means "counsel," " my wish," and the Apostolic Church " witnessed the will of God in the new counsel of Christianity." Smyrna Y2</page><page sequence="3">33 Studies. [SEPT., means "myrrh," the emblem of blood, and thus the fit symbol of the Martyrs' Age. Pergamos means " dividing the horns." It witnesses to the separation of truth from heresy, which took place in the third age; also the division of the Church into East and West. Thyatira means " to be lighted tip,,, and symbolises the enlightenment of the Gentiles in the third age. Sardis means "the the cause of beauty," referring to the Reformation persecution, which renewed the strength and beauty of the Church in the fifth age. Philadelphia means " brotherly love," the characteristic of the present or sixth age. And Laodicea means "vomiting," significant of the last age of the Church. The reader should not be discouraged by these specimens of philology. He will find it worth his while to read on, and if his capacity for wonder is developed he will pass on from surprise to surprise to the end of the section. He will have somewhat the sensation of watching a top kept spinning by sheer speed and dexterous whipping. It requires no small skill on Col. Ratton's part to keep his argument spinning with the speed and balance which it maintains to the end, but at best, the equilibrium of the top is an unstable thing. It is tempting to quote some instances of the process by which he illustrates the realisation of St. John's prophecies in the history of the Church, but the reader must see them for himself. We will only state here that we are in the sixth or Philadelphian age. It is the age of the "open door," as is proved by the Oxford Move ment, and the progress of the Church in America. But it has its dangers, too, and a piquant allusion to the American divorce courts exemplifies these. In accordance with a prophecy of the Ven. Holzhauser, whose teaching is often quoted in the book when the Apocalyptist is found wanting, the opening of the Philadelphian age is coupled with the names of Pius Ix. and "the Queen-Empress Victoria, the great Christian 600arch" of the new and regenerated Roman Empire. Is the Laodicean age beginning now It is impos sible to say with certainty, but in view of the "dissolving of Jesus" of i John iv., 3, exemplified by the spreading disbelief in His Divinity, " it is a remarkable fact that the present Angel of the Churches, Pope Pius X., has taken for his motto, Restore all things to Christ." We have dwelt at some length on what is only, after all, about a third of the book. Our excuse must be that this part is really for Col. Patton the quintessence of the whole. it is</page><page sequence="4">1913. The Apocalypse of St. John. 331 impossible to criticise in detail this kind of exegesis. The reader will have already judged it. The Seven Age theory dates from the twelfth century, when it was popularised by the disciples of Joachim of Flore, its inventor. For them the " Millennium was attained when the Mendicant Friars spread over Europe," and the "beast beast from the sea " was the Pope who opposed their full development, and " the beast from the land " the Emperor Frederick II. That place of privilege was heartily endorsed to their successors by Wicleff, Luther, and Calvin for controversial reasons. It is to the credit of the Spanish Jesuit, Lewis of Alcasar, to have seen the futility of this method of exegesis, and to have tried to trace in the Apocalypse the historical persecutions of the early Church in a bulky com mentary published in 1616. It cannot but be regarded as a retro gression that the Ven. Holzhauser (1646 reverted to the old system, and aggravated it by interpreting the Seven Letters also as prophetic of the Seven Ages. Yet he has found numerous imitators down to our own day-de la Chetardie, Joubert, l' Etemare, Verschraage, Sentenac; and in 1900, M. Jules Severin published his " Clef a 1'Apocalypse," which claims to have dispelled once and for ever all the obscurity that hung round the book. The "peril jaune " is the " key " to the Apocalypse, and its champions are freemasonry and the Jews. By a series of calculations from the text he arrived at the conclusion that the year 1912 would in all probability see the advent of Antichrist, 1923 the second great invasion from the East, 1952 the third, 1953 the fourth and last, while Antichrist would disappear only in 1957. Col. Ratton has avoided these extravagances, but it is a pity that he should have exposed himself to being logically forced into them. He is in the anomalous position of having adopted two opposite methods of exegesis in the same work that of Joachim and the Reformers for the Seven Letters and the Millennium, that of their opponents, and especially of Alcasar and Bossuet, for the rest of the book. The result of this electicism is that just that part of the Apocalypse which is most direct and literal in its tone and tenour is interpreted as cryptic and symbolic, and the obscure imagery of the remainder is stretched and strained to bring it into agreement with the minutest details of the Jewish and Roman catastrophes. The author has adopted in the main the thesis of Alcasar that Chapters IV.-IX. describe the Jewish war, and Chapters XII.-XIX. the vengeance of God on Rome-with the improvements mentioned above. But even in</page><page sequence="5">332 Studies.?udStudies.[SEPT., its new form there is little to justify the Jewish theme." Apart from the intrinsic improbability of the Apocalypse being meant to serve as a warning to the Christians in Jerusalem (especially with R's. interpretation of the Seven Letters), there is little beyond a few fragments (e.g., vii., i-8; xi., 1-13, of ', very eschatological flavour to connect with the Jewish war. Not more justified is the explanation of vi., 9-17, and ix., 13-2 I, as descriptive of the Neronian persecution and the Wars of Galba, etc., respectively. Col. Ratton regards Chapters XV I . ff. as the detailed enumeration of the woes already described in a general way in the preceding visions. Here the influence of Bossuet's commentary is very apparent, and the variations in the present book not always for the better. R. adopts with enthusiasm the explanation of the number of the beast by gematria as the name of Nero in Hebrew characters. That is probably correct, but its very simplicity has prevented its universal ac300tance. Since 1835, Marker, Kliefoth (followed by Porter and Tiefenthal), Kaulen, Spitta, Volter, Gunkel, Barton, Burkitt, Clemen, Corssen, Vischer, and perhaps others, have all argued plausibly for other interpretations, while attacking that adopted by R. as unassailable The author argues with skill for the Neronian date of the Apocalypse. Without wishing to contest his conclusions, it must be remarked that he has not stated the case for the Domitian date quite fully. He tries to whittle down the Domitian persecution by showing that it was due, not to reli gious antipathy, but to the rapacity of a needy prince. Even supposing that that were the case, it is not quite clear how that modifies the argument for the later date. The fact would remain that the Christians as a body were subjected to persecu. tion of great intensity. But it is not true that the persecution was not specifically religious. The testi600y of all Christian antiquity expressly affirms it, and most Christian writers couple it for fierceness with that of Nero. Nor is it true that the pagan historians give no hint of this religious aspect of it. Eusebius (Hist. iii., Y8 expressly appeals to pagan testi600y (probably that of Bruttius Praesens), and if the language of Suetonius and Tacitus is not explicit, it is more than sugges. tive. It is notorious that the accusations of " segnitia " and aOfo's were uniformly levelled at the Christians. (Cf. instances in Allard, Persecutions, i., 75 ff.). But even were no direct testi600y available, the pretensions of Domitian to divine honours spelt certain religious persecution, not in Rome only,</page><page sequence="6">1913v The Apocalypse of St. John. 333 but still more in the eastern provinces, which invariably out stripped the capital in emperor-worship. Col. Ratton strains the natural meaning of the words of Clement to the Corin thians : there is much more than the apprehension of impending persecution in the language of the Pope. Finally, the episode of the descendants of David admits of a different and more probable interpretation than that of R. Much of the ancient Christian testi600y to the Domitian persecution asserts that it was dropped before the end of the reign. Now, the passage in question expressly states that the emperor "feared feared the coming of Christ as Herod had done," evidently because he saw in Him a dangerous rival to his throne. After examining the two Christians, he found that his fears were groundless, and abandoned the persecution. But this abandon ment does not prove anything against the very real nature of the previous persecution. Does not the author himself count the Domitian persecution in his commentary on ii., zo, side by side with those of Nero. A careful revision would doubtless eliminate a few " lapsus calami," e.g., that St. Paul was shipwrecked at Malta on his way to Jerusalem just before his meeting with the presbyters of Ephesus (p. 104); that the choice of Greek as the language in which the Apocalypse was to be written was, " like its Hebraic cypher, a measure of secrecy " (p. 12o ; that the anthropomorphic Antichrist is medieval in its origin (p. 257), although there is a reference elsewhere (p. 28 to the book of Hyppolitus; the quotation of Nerva's inscription as Nero's. It is a pity that Col. Ratton did not judge opportune to give his own translation of the Greek text instead of one which is no longer quite up to date. The use of footnotes would have helped to relieve the text of references, and of not a few repetitions. In spite of these strictures, the book can be recommended as a stimulus to the study of the Apocalypse. The author writes with an earnestness and conviction, which, if they do not always persuade, will not fail to win the respect of the reader. But these qualities make it all the more regrettable that he should haxe expended so much real ingenuity, research and talent on a task which can no longer be considered as rendering real ser vice to the cause of Biblical criticism. Defenders of the inspiration of the Apocalypse must now, if ever, devote them selves to the study of the literary structure, the Apocalyptic tradition, and the historical conditions under which the book was composed. This last element Col. Ratton has treated with</page><page sequence="7">384 Studies. CSIEP .s</page></plain_text>
