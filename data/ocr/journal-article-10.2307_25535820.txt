<plain_text><page sequence="1">TATTOOED LADY?: A CARVED STONE HEAD FROM THE GRAVEYARD OF KILLOGILLEEN, CO. GALWAY R. M. CHAPPLE INTRODUCTION From March 1995 to October 1997 the author was employed by Craughwell Parish council to supervise the FAS sponsored 'Community Enterprise Scheme' clean-up of the graveyards of Killora and Killogilleen in the modern parish of Craughwell Co. Galway. The aims of the project were to cut back the brambles, grass and trees; along with trimming the ivy covering the churches at both sites. As a complementary part of this work, two volumes of gravestone inscriptions were compiled (Chappie 1995; 1997). On the 4th of July 1996, when work was ongoing at Killogilleen graveyard, one of the workmen, Mr. Sean Howley, brought the author's attention to a carved stone representation of a human head. It had been uncovered in the western portion of the cemetery, under a dense patch of dead, matted grass and brambles (Fig. 1). The church and graveyard of Killogilleen themselves form the focus of an interesting complex of monuments. These include a collapsed souterrain lying c.300m to the west. Outside the modern boundary wall of the site, to the north and north west, are the traceable remains of a small deserted Medieval village (McCaffrey 1952, 231). It is comprised of a series of hut and house sites along with associated field walls. In addition, an Anglo Norman moated-site lies in the adjacent field to the south-east (Holland, 1987). While the majority of the church's fabric appears to be of late 15th to early 16th century date, there is some evidence of a late 12th to early 13th century phase of building (Chappie 1997, 5 f\ 7 ^ /V i X deserted Medieval village ,^^^ n souterrain \ \/ [ &lt;! vA Killogilleen \ W graveyard / \ Fig. 1: Location of Killogilleen graveyard and surrounding archaeological sites.</page><page sequence="2">182 R.M. CHAPPLE 8). The graveyard itself contains memorials dating from the 1640s to the 1980s (Chappie op. cit 1997; 2000). A short distance to the south-east are the imposing remains of 'Cregg castle' tower house. DESCRIPTION The head lies at the western end of a probably 18th century recumbent slab, commissioned by 'Timtioty Halland' [sic] (Chappie op. cit 1997, Kn22,23) (Fig. 2). It is carved from a single block of limestone, measuring 0.29m wide, by 0.23m thick. At the front it protrudes 0.30m above the present ground surface, falling off to 0.42m at the back, where the ground surface is lower, beneath the recumbent slab (Pis. 1-4). Although the stone is roughly square in section, the upper surface is in the form of a half cylinder, giving the front and back elevations of the figure a rounded, almost 'barrel-vaulted' appearance. As no distinct chisel marks etc. appear on this curved upper surface of the head, it is impossible to state whether a naturally shaped stone was chosen for the purpose, or whether the rounded surface was artificially wrought. Nonetheless, the sides of the stone appear to have been roughly dressed, though the visible portion of the back seems to be a naturally flat, un-worked surface. The carving itself depicts a face with ovoid or lentoid eyes (each 46mm wide x 23mm), set high in the head (just below the hair-line), a long and slightly splayed h ? % iB. ?? L | n Li0 ____--?

The pupils of the eyes appear to have been marked as incised dots, though owing to some slight damage or weather-related spalling to the left eye, it is hard to be certain. These features, together with the slight detailing of the hair and the demarcation between the face and hair, and also between the neck and chin, are all executed as a series of incised lines. The only exception to this is the mouth which is carved deeper and wider than the rest. The area outside the mouth is carved slightly deeper, leaving a flattened o-shaped pair of lips in low relief; in particular the chin has been lowered t^hjelp accentuate the lips. A similar</page><page sequence="3">TATTOOED LADY 183 PI. 1: Front view of Killogilleen head, from the west. technique was used to define the lips of a stone head from Killeen, Belcarra, Castlebar, Co. Mayo (Morahan 1987-8, 147). The whole effect is to give the figure a slightly quizzical look of someone in the act of speaking or exhaling. The figure's face tapers steeply to a distinct and steeply rounded chin. A further incised line demarcates the chin from the neck below (35mm long x 65mm wide), presumably to provide a sense of depth between the two. This differentiation between neck and chin is broadly similar to that of the 'Lusrymore Idol', Co. Fermanagh where an incised line separates the chest from a pointed chin (Rynne 1972, 86, pi. ix, 3; Hickey 1976,1985,18, fig. 7). The areas between the jaw-line and the lower portion of the hair, and on both sides of the neck are deeply carved (c.50mm),. which gives added depth to the composition. These two recessed areas continue down to the bottom of the visible portion of the stone, where they taper out, presumably to form the figure's shoulders. With the exception of these two areas, the face is carved in the flat. The hair is depicted as a semi-circular arch running across the top of the head. It is thickest at the top, where it measures 50mm, tapering down to 25mm at the extremities. Just like the facial features, the depiction appears to be highly stylised. At the highest point on the head, the hair is. shown with two short, deeply indented, curving lines, the only discernable detailing within the entire hair-style. These lines are 35mm apart at the top, joining together to form a V-shape. Although these may have been intended to depict some form of hair ornament, it is most likely that they were carved to represent a centre-parting, though this does not continue along the top of the rounded head. The most striking feature of the head, however, are the incised lines running across the face. They are composed of two sets of four asymmetrical lines on both sides of the face. On each side, the lower two lines appear to join with the lowest portion of the figures' nose, forming a somewhat lop-sided moustache. Also, on the right hand side of the figures' face (the observers' left) there are a series of at least two, and possibly more, lines running at opposing angles to the previous. These may be evidence of later damage, though they may equally be an original component of the composition.</page><page sequence="4">184 R.M.

In the case of the Killogilleen head these are further exacerbated by the fact that the piece is partially buried, obscuring any potential decoration or details which may enhance our understanding. In addition, the use of the local landscape setting of sites and monuments as a likely source of either the craftsmen or commissioners, and thus a potential date, is of little help in narrowing down the period of construction. From the evidence presented above this could have been at any time from, at least, the Early Christian period to as late as the 19th century. Taking the individual aspects of the carving, the hair or headdress may be paralleled on the Iron Age stone sculpture from Nimes (Jacobsthal 1944,165; pl.5), though this is tenuous at best. Certainly, there is nothing in the surviving corpus of Irish Iron Age sculpture that possesses a similar coiffure, besides which the distribution of known examples excludes Connacht (Rynne op. cit, 80). The most easily paralleled aspects of the sculpture are the incised lines, which run across the face. One example is to be found in the 'mouth-puller' from Castletown Castle, Co. Louth, which may be contemporary with the late 15th century construction date for the castle (Buckley 1986, pi. 203; Buckley &amp; Sweetman 1991; Sweetman 1999, 143). A second mouth-puller with a lined face is found on a corbel at the late 17th century Carntown tower house, Co. Louth (Buckley ibid., pi. 203; Buckley &amp; Sweetman ibid., 362, pi. 201; Sweetman 1999, 145). Buckley &amp; Sweetman describe this example as a 'hairy human face'. Although the ' facial lines on this example are much finer than the Castletown example, in the opinion of this author, both represent wrinkles or 'character lines', the latter being an attempt to add a v. m x \^^3^^v ,., ^ &gt;,__? * ?^B ^HF ^Sfifi3f^^HHB?B*^B PI. 4: Side view of Killogilleen head, from the north.</page><page sequence="6">186 R.M. CHAPPLE greater degree of expressiveness to the carving, not merely an indication of advanced age. Another carving with a lined face includes the 13th century carving from Ferns Castle, Co. Wexford (Sweetman ibid., 78; Stout 1999, 24). An interesting group of figure sculptures, of all periods, lie in the Lough Erne basin, many of which have faces decorated with incised lines (Hickey 1976,1985). These include a 15th century example at the Premonstratensian Abbey at Trinity Island, Lough Oughter, Co. Cavan (Hickey op. cit., 76-7; Davies 1948, 99-100, pi. xix, 2); an undated head from Keenaghan Lough, near Tievealough church, Co. Fermanagh (Hickey op. cit. 78-9); one of 15th or 16th century date from Castleterra church, Co. Cavan (Hickey ibid.; Davies op. cit., 80, pi. xi, 4) and a very heavily lined face, of probable late Medieval date, from Clannaphilip church, Termon Td., Co. Cavan (Hickey op. cit. 78, 80; Davies op. cit., 98; Barron 1941, 113). The facial lines on this latter example are so deep and furrowed as to preclude a direct association with the carvings listed previously. In this instance, if the lines are anything other than a heavily stylised decoration, they may represent all-over facial hair. However, Andersen argues that these facial lines represent tattooing and sites as examples 'sheela-na-gigs' at Fethard Abbey, Old Wall, Fethard and Clonmel, all in Co. Tipp*erary, along with one at Rahan, Co. Off aly, and the aforementioned Clannaphilip head (Andersen 1977, 84-7,123,151 &amp; fig. 55). With regard to the Killogilleen sculpture, Lanigan Wood is of the opinion that the flatness of the face and the shape of the mouth are more typical of post Medieval carving than Medieval. However, the work could still be Medieval in date: the sculptor may have been self-taught and somewhat lacking in skill, one 'who had not inherited the best sculptural traditions found elsewhere in Ireland' (Lanigan Wood pers. comm.). Overall, she considers that the piece could have been created at any point between the 15th and 19th centuries. Similarly, Heather King (pers. comm.) suggests a broadly 17th century date. The question of function must also be addressed, though the problem of limited visibility above ground is, again, a hindrance. In the first instance, it is unlikely that the sculpture was intended as a burial marker, though this cannot be ruled out. The relatively rough back and sides would suggest that the sculpture was not intended to act as a freestanding monument, observed from all sides. However, it may have been originally incorporated into the fabric of the surviving church; possibly in the north wall or west gable, both of which are now demolished. Lanigan Wood (pers. comm.) suggests that the figures' rounded head would have made it suitable for display within a niche. Such a form of enclosed display is consistent with the observation that the possible depiction of the 'centre-parting' does not continue across the top of the head, suggesting that this portion of the stone was not intended to be viewed. However, it is impossible to be in any way definitive about how this figure was originally displayed. Finally, consideration must be given as to who is depicted by this sculpture. The visible portion of the figure, though appearing to be broadly feminine in appearance, is more accurately described as androgynous. As no saint of either sex is directly associated with the site, male candidates could include any of the clergy</page><page sequence="7">TATTOOED LADY 187 who served there. As the name of the site, Killogilleen, is derived from Cillogcillin, the church of the O'Killeens or Killeens the carving could commemorate any of their number (Holt 1911-2, 152). Papal letters relating to the site from March 1491 and February 1492 name various clergy, including: Geoffrey Ocuan, Florence Ogerabayn and Geoffrey de Burgo (Haren 1978,319-2,414). As is to be expected at this time, the running of the church appears to have been an all-male affair. Alternately, the figure may represent a bishop of Kilmacduagh (the bishopric to which Killogilleen owed allegiance), or it may be of Christ himself. However, if this near genderless head is that of a female, the possibilities are much more limited: the only likely candidate being the Virgin Mary. Aside from Christian parallels, the combination of a sexually ambiguous carving and apparent damage to the left eye are reminiscent of a number of prehistoric wooden idols from the British Isles, associated with Odin (Coles 1998,166,170; 1990,332).1 While this observation is intriguing it is most likely fortuitous. Nonetheless, a similar form of damage is also noted on the left eyes of both the Killeen stone head (Morahan ibid.) and the Lustymore Island figure (Hickey op. cit. 18, fig. 17). In discussing the latter figure, Lowry-Corry suggests that this was intended to depict a blind, or closed eye (Lowry-Corry 1933, 204). CONCLUSION The visible portion of the figure, though small in size, presents a bewildering variety of potential interpretations. While it is most likely that the carving is of late Medieval to post-Medieval in date, aspects of the decoration suggest parallels with earlier periods. Although some of these may be accidental, enough survive to tantalise. At present it is possible to argue that the Killogilleen head is a representation of anyone from a wrinkled priest or bishop, to a tattooed Virgin Mary. Until such time as the full extent of the carving is made visible, in the hope that additional details may survive, little more may be added to the debate of the date, form or function of this enigmatic figure.
