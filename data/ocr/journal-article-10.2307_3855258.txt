<plain_text><page sequence="1">BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS The jackals of the sun-boat IN this Journal, 31, 105, Mr. Dawson published a note in which he mentions the representation of the sun-boat towed along the river of night by jackals. Two recent publications give me occasion to return to this subject. The author only names one text, that on the 'chess-game' with a duplicate. Now there are many more. I quote Berlin stela 7306,1. 9 (the oldest example I know: Dyn. XVIII); Mag. Pap. Harris, v, 11. 4-5; Leps., Denkm. Text, III, 301, and Piehl, Inscript. I, pl. 141, 1. 2 (both Theban tombs); de Morgan, Kom Ombos, I, 87, pl. 107, 1. 3 below (all mentioned Wb. Ill, 420, 10); Brugsch, Grofle Oase, pI. 25, 1. 9 (var. of Harris; Pieper, ZAS 66, 25); Pap. Berlin 3049 vs., XIV, 1. 61; Varille, Ann. Serv. 50, pI. 22, I, i.m.; Klasens, A Magical Statue Base (Socle Behague) in the Museum of Antiquities at Leiden, Leiden, 1952, 1o8, h 38 (?). The first four of them and the game-text are prior to the Twenty-first Dyn., the period which is recorded by Dawson as the oldest for the occurrence of pictorial representations. A propos of the latter it may interest the reader to get some details. The number of the animals varies. To give examples: B.M. coffin 36211 shows one (Handbook, 39), the Saitic stela Hildesheim 1874 two (Scharff, Sonnenlieder, fig. 6) whereas the papyrus of Dirpu at Cairo depicts three of them, black, yellow, and red (Vigneau-Drioton, Le Musee du Caire [Paris, 1949], 155; Dyn. XXI), and Dawson's Turin vignette four2 (as in the text of Lepsius). On the Saitic or later coffin Hildesheim I953 it is Osiris who is drawn in the boat (Capart, Chron. d'tg. I8, fig. 28). One of the recent publications to which I allude is an archaeological survey by M. Leclant in Orientalia, n.s. 22, fasc. i. He describes there among other things a cleaning of the tomb of Ramose, treasurer of Taharqa (Shekh Abd el-Kurnah 132), by M. de Stoppelaere. PI. I3, fig. 26, shows a wall-painting with the sun-boat towed by three jackals. What struck me on this photo is that a legend was added to the animals which is to be read Bow Nhn 'Souls of Hieraconpolis'. So the name of those jackal-headed beings who jubilate at dawn both in literature and in picture figures. here also. The other edition is the Bollingen publication of the tomb of Ramesses VI (Piankoff-Rambova; Dyn. XX) and in that work the Book of Night in particular. On pls. 150-2 of part II one sees four jackals towing together with and in front of the anthropomorphic 'Ihmw-wrd stars and guided by the god P;wty nnty. According to the related text of the Book their name is Bow imntyw 'Souls of the West', whereas their colleagues in a similar but not the same position (they precede the drawers) have been allotted the legend B,w Zibtyw 'Souls of the East' (pl. 159; Day).3 M. HEERMA VAN Voss The costume and insignia of the king in the sed-festival PROFESSOR Samuel A. B. Mercer in his book, The Religion of Ancient Egypt (London, 1949), 122 states that in the sed-festival 'the king assumed the costume and insignia of Osiris', adding (in n. I 14) that the present writer in JEA 28, 71 'contradicts this generally accepted statement without furnishing any adequate proof'. I was there reviewing G. D. Hornblower's articles, 'Osiris and His Rites', and my brief statement ('. . . it is not true to say that the king wears Osirian dress at the sed- festival') seems now to call for a slight elaboration. The king is depicted in two forms in representations of the sed-festival. When he performs the festival dance he is shown wearing a short kilt with a long 'tail' behind. It would be interesting to Zandee, De hymnen aan Amon van papyrus Leiden I 350, Leiden, 1948, 14. 2 Cf. too Schott, ZAS 74, pl. 6 and p. 89, who calls it Ramesside. 3 Cf. I, 400, 426, 427 and the edition of the Book by Piankoff and Drioton, 76-79, 89-93, and pl. 8. M. Piankoff refers to Bruyere, Deir el Me'dineh (I930), Le Caire, 1 933, 53, and pL. 15 where four jackals are asked to announce the deceased in the cabin and to draw him in the 'golden boat' (Dyn. XX). I27</page><page sequence="2">BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS know where Osiris is depicted in this form. The king is also represented in a pavilion, and his appearance here varies. In one early example (Petrie, Royal Tombs, I, xv, no. I6) he wears a long robe reminiscent of the shape of a mummy or of Osiris, but on his head is a Double Crown, which does not suit Osiris. In Das Re-Heiligtum des Konigs Ne-woser-re II, Taf. I (= Kees, Opfertanz, Abb. I i) he has the White Crown, but his cloak is a short one which barely reaches the knee. I know of no example where the form is entirely Osirian. As to the insignia (which I did not mention), they of course include the flail and sceptre which are also carried by Osiris. But it is open to question whose attributes they were first of all,h the god's or the king's. y own belief is that they were the king's. The phrase 'generally accepted', used by Mercer of his statement, is an exaggeration. Frazer, Moret, Petrie, and Margaret Murray seem to have taken this view, although Petrie (The Palace of Apries, 8) made reservations. The opposite view has been propagated by Gardiner (JEA 2, 124); Kees, Opfertanz, I65 (of the dress outside the pavilion), cf. Nachr. Gottingen, 1927, 196, and Gotter- glaube im alten Agypten, 32; Newberry, Agypten als Feld fiir anthropologische Forschung, 2I; and Wainwright, The Sky-Religion in Egypt, 20, where some other references to the literature of the subject are given. J. GWYN GRIFFITHS A note on Ast-Raset IN JEA 33, 58-62, Mr. Wainwright argues for the identification of the Ast-Raset mentioned in the Nastasen stela with the group of wells now known as Abu Tuleih.' FIG. I. I This name is certainly 4 y 1, Cb being the plural of C, the acacia seyal, a particularly attractive red barked acacia. The name is most appropriate, as coming from the desert this is the first place that the tree, common near the river, is found. The version Abu Klea arises from mishearing by British soldiers.
