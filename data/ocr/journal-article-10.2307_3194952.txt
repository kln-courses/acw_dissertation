<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Interaction of Aestheticism and American Consumer Culture in Nabokov's Lolita Dana Brand Throughout his life, Vladimir Nabokov resisted the attempts of "literary mythists and sociologists"' to find satire or moral didacticism in his work. In the "Afterword" to Lolita he insists that he is "neither a reader nor a writer of didactic fiction" (286) and in an interview, he once flatly denied that his work has anything in particular to say about the contem- porary world.2 It is, I think, because of Nabokov's unusually vehement resistance to such interpretations that the only aspects of Lolita which have been neglected in the criticism of the past thirty years have been the book's moral and satiric dimensions. In the following article, I would like to explore these dimensions. I wish to propose a satirical and morally didactic reading of Lolita that is both respectful and skeptical of Nabok- ov's stated feelings on the subject. I do not believe that Nabokov wrote Lolita with a clearly didactic intention. But I think that, considering that Nabokov had, as he put it, some very "strong opinions" about a wide range of moral and social subjects, it is hard to believe that these opinions do not manifest themselves in some way in Lolita, his most comprehen- sive representation of modem American life. In the interviews collected in the volume Strong Opinions, Nabokov repeatedly makes clear that the strongest of his moral and social opinions is his advocacy of the right to unlimited freedom of thought and expression. When asked to describe his notion of an ideal political state, Nabokov could only say that it should provide "Freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of art. The social or economic structure of the ideal state is of little concern to me."3 This value of freedom of expression is central to Nabokov's closest approach to overt moral didac- ticism, his representation of a totalitarian society in Invitation to a Behead- ing.4 It was an important source both of his hatred of the Soviet Union and of his strong patriotic feelings for his adopted United States of America. Yet for all of his affection for the country and its ideals, the author of Lolita appears to have had few illusions about the degree to which individual autonomy is actually respected in the United States. I think that Lolita addresses itself to this issue. Like another European observer of America, Alexis de Tocqueville, Nabokov suggests in Lolita that the society which claims to have freed itself from traditional forms of coercive authority has evolved new and more covert forms to replace the old. Each of the Americans Humbert encounters constructs their identity and view of the world according to the images of normalcy provided by advertising, mass culture, and applied social science. Only Humbert the foreigner is able to resist the influence of these new and powerful forms of coercion. He does this by aesthetically distancing himself from the American commercial and social environment. By representing this act of distancing, Nabokov implicitly offers a theory of "aesthetic" morality. Ultimately Humbert 14</page><page sequence="2">transgresses against the principles of this morality by permitting his aes- theticism to degenerate into a version of the consumerism against which it served as a shield. By tracing this dynamic in the text, I hope to show that Nabokov's disavowals of moral or satiric intention, in the "Afterword" to Lolita, should not perhaps be taken much more seriously than Twain's at the opening of Huck Finn. The clearest and most obvious example of Nabokov's satiric treatment of the standardizing pressures of American life is his characteri- zation of Charlotte Haze. As Humbert notes and describes in detail, her behavior and view of the world are determined entirely by homemaking guides, Hollywood films, movie magazines, advertisements, psycho- analytic cliches and such "deadly conventionalities" as book clubs or bridge clubs. In order to be able to control Charlotte, Humbert quickly learns to manipulate the languages of her interior life. He takes a great deal of pride in the ease and art with which he does this when he describes the artificial romantic past he creates for her consumption. He writes: The sincerity and artlessness with which she discussed what she called her "love life," . . . were, ethically, in striking contrast with my glib compositions, but technically the two sets were congeneric since both were affected by the same stuff (soap operas, psychoanalysis, and cheap novelettes) upon which I drew for my characters and she for her mode of expression. (75) Making up a past for Charlotte, or making up a psyche for the psychoanalysts in the sanatorium, Humbert constructs "pure classics in style" (34) out of the material of sign systems for which he has nothing but contempt. In the process, he drains these sign systems of the immanence so necessary for their functioning. In the following passage, describing Lolita, Humbert defines the quality of immanence which is the source of the coercive power of each of the popular American sign systems he represents. He writes: She it was to whom the ads were dedicated: the ideal consumer, the subject and object of every foul poster ... She believed, with a kind of celestial trust, any advertisement or advice that appeared in Movie Love or Screen Land-Starasil Starves Pimples or "You better watch out if you're wearing your shirttails outside your jeans, gals, because Jill says you shouldn't." If a roadside sign said: VISIT OUR GIFT SHOP-we had to visit it, had to buy its Indian curios, dolls, copper jewelry, cactus candy ... If some cafe sign proclaimed Icecold Drinks, she was automat- ically stirred, although all drinks everywhere were ice cold. (136) For those who have this "celestial trust," advertising contains an authorita- tive presence. Those who trust will buy products expecting to enjoy the idealized existence represented in ads. As Humbert represents them, all of Charlotte's desires are of this nature. Going to Europe, for example, is to enter a travel poster. As an image of a more desirable existence than that which we ordinarily experience, advertising is, in Nabokov's own terms, a false double of art. In the "Afterword" to Lolita, Nabokov offers a 15</page><page sequence="3">conception of art as an ideal realm when he writes that the art of fiction exists to give him the sense of being "connected with other states of being where art (curiosity, tenderness, kindness, ecstasy) is the norm." (286) Yet art, as Nabokov conceives of it, is merely an image of such an existence. Nabokov implies that we do not cease to be aware of the discrepancy between art and the world in which it is not the "norm." As he cheerfully admits elsewhere: "All art is deception."5 Advertising differs from art in that it attempts to go beyond the mere presentation of an image. Its message is that if one buys the product referred to by the ad, one will actually be able to experience the felicity represented in it. Advertise- ments purposely obscure their deceptive nature. They insist that what they represent can be had and that the spending of money is all that is necessary to deliver the referent. What is true of advertising is true of all of the aspects of American culture Humbert comes into contact with. Psychoanalysis and mass cul- ture are also, as Humbert represents them, efforts to replace reality with imaginative representations that, unlike art, insist that they are real and that what they represent can actually be had. In Lolita, Humbert strips advertising, mass culture, and psychoanalysis of any power they might have had over him by denying them the referential nature they claim for themselves. He turns them, in other words, from advertisements into art. He accomplishes this by separating images from their referents. Once they have been abstracted, Humbert can either impose a personal form on the images (creating his own "pure classics in style") or he can appropriate them poetically. Humbert's description of a town in Appalachia is a striking example of the latter process: The town was dead. Nobody strolled and laughed on the sidewalks as relaxing burghers would in sweet, mellow, rotting Europe. I was alone to enjoy the innocent night and my terrible thoughts. A wire receptacle on the curb was very particular about acceptable contents: Sweepings. Paper. No garbage. Sherry-red letters of light marked a Camera Shop. A large thermomenter with the name of a laxative quietly dwelt on the front of a drugstore. Rubinov's Jewelry Company had a display of artificial diamonds reflected in a red mirror. A lighted green clock swam in the linenish depth of Jiffy Jeff Laundry. On the other side of the street a garage said in its sleep--genuflexion lubricity; and corrected itself to Gullflex Lubrication. An airplane, also gemmed by Rubinov, passed, droning in the velvet heavens. (257) The quiet deadness of the town is a readiness for Humbert's imaginative impregnation. He takes advantage of its silence just as he wanted to take advantage of a sleeping, drugged Lolita. The world becomes animated with Humbert's consciousness. The wire receptacle becomes very particular. A thermometer with the name of a laxative "dwells" on a drugstore. A green clock "swims" in a laundry. A garage talks in its sleep and says something that only Humbert's misreading could make it say. An airplane is gemmed by a jeweller. A world of shop windows, signs, laxative and lubrication advertisements becomes a beautiful realm of anthropomorphic colored light in Humbert's consciousness. The advertis- 16</page><page sequence="4">ing message in the light is of no importance to him. The name of the liquor store is of less importance to him than the fact that the letters on its sign are "sherry-red." The name of the lubrication is important only for what it suggests to him. By aestheticizing the objects he sees, Humbert neutralizes the coercive power they have as signs in commercial American culture. This town is as complete a symbol as we may find of the America Humbert represents. It is dead, but filled with a dazzling artificial life. People have been replaced by commercial images. This is true of the world of the novel in at least two senses. The American environment Humbert has been passing through consists of an enormous profusion of images that prevent one from seeing the people behind and among them. Also, people have become so thoroughly determined by these images that the images may be said to replace them. But if this moment in the sleeping town represents Humbert's America, it also represents what Humbert does to America. By reducing the commercial world to dead images he may then revivify, Humbert gains an imaginative control over that which controls the imagination of those around him. This mode of establishing control is evident in all of Humbert's interactions with the external world. Humbert's aesthetic appropriation of people, things, and events is figured, first of all, by the profusion of photographic images in the book. Humbert's first sexual responses are to the photographs in Pichon's La Beaute Humaine. His only souvenir of Annabel is a photograph of her eating an ice cream cone. Humbert asks to see a photograph of Charlotte as a child so that he can have a greater sense of her resemblance to Lolita. At several points in the book, Humbert compares his own visual impres- sions and memories to photographs. At the opening of the book, as he is about to describe his childhood, he writes: "I am going to pass around in a minute some lovely glossy-blue picture postcards." (12) After some play- fulness with Lolita, Humbert laments: "(pity no film has recorded the curious pattern, the monogrammic linkage of our simultaneous or over- lapping moves)." (55) After he reaches orgasm with Lolita sprawled across his lap, he attempts to morally exonerate himself by arguing that what he had done had "affected her as little as if she were a photographic image rippling upon a screen and I a humble hunchback abusing myself in the dark." (59) A photograph is a separation of surface from substance. It provides an empty form that lends itself to the imaginative "filling" of the viewer. The hunchback can make love to a photographic image but he can never make love to the actress. The intention of Humbert's aestheti- cism is apparently to reduce American reality to the status of a photograph. Photography is not the only model the book provides us for Hum- bert's aestheticism. In Lolita there is a striking profusion of literal and figurative references to murder. There is, I think, a connection. The connection between photography, murder, Humbert's aestheticism, and his love for Lolita is suggested in his analysis of his first masturbatory gratification with her. Humbert writes: Thus had I delicately constructed my ignoble, ardent, sinful dream; and still Lolita was safe-and I was safe. What I had madly possessed was not 17</page><page sequence="5">she, but my creation, another fanciful Lolita-perhaps more real than Lolita; overlapping, encasing her; floating between me and her, and having no will, no consciousness-indeed, no life of her own ... (it had) ... affected her as little as if she were a photographic image rippling upon a screen and I a humble hunchback abusing myself in the dark. (59) The creation of such a fantastic image is, like taking a picture, a kind of murder of that which one is making an image of. As in the act of murder, a living person is replaced by a lifeless form of one. Humbert's masturba- tion before his image is accompanied by Lolita's singing of a song about a man shooting his mistress (his "little Carmen") to death. Humbert refers to Lolita several times in the book as his "little Carmen." The morning after he makes love to her for the first time he feels in her presence as if he "were sitting with the small ghost of somebody I had just killed." Humbert murders Quilty and contemplates murdering Charlotte, Dick Schiller, Valechka, and Taxovich. Ultimately the book itself is the murder of everyone in it since it is published only after all the important characters are dead. The book, a series of lifeless images, replaces the living people it purports to be about. Humbert's replacement of the world with his own image of it is also figured in the fact that he must re-name everyone and every place in the book in order to disguise their "real" identities. Humbert is able to rename his childhood sweetheart Annabel Lee. He can rename a taxi driver Taxovich, a girl's camp director Shirley Holmes, and, on a scientific expedition to Pierre Point in Melville Sound, he has an affair with a nutritionist he can name Dr. Johnson. Humbert evidently delights in names and their allusiveness. At one point, he gets a hold of a list of the names of Lolita's classmates. Calling the list "a poem I know by heart," (49) Humbert invents a personality for each child according to the allusive qualities of his or her name. This activity is another paradigm of Hum- bert's aesthetic process. Separating names from their referents, Humbert attaches his own imaginative referents to them. Also, by making up the names himself, he is able to give them an imagistic transparency more characteristic of art than of unaestheticized reality. Not only does Humbert collect the various surfaces he separates from substance, he classifies them as well. With his classifications, he gives a personal meaning to objects by creating a personal context for them which is independent of any context in which they may have had any other meaning. Nymphets, after all, are a species. What is most important to Humbert are the qualities which they temporarily manifest. The defini- tion of these qualities, which are fixed and unchanging in ways that the individuals who manifest them are not, gives Humbert a control over an image that he could not have over an actual human being. This same process is evident when Humbert travels across America and classifies everything from hitchhikers to motels. Here too, Humbert deprives the external world of its independence by reducing things to temporary manifestations of types over which he has complete conceptual control. Humbert's aesthetic re-invention of America, as the preceding survey of his mental processes suggests, involves a kind of imaginative 18</page><page sequence="6">violence against it. Everything outside of Humbert's consciousness is deprived of its independence and is transformed in such a way that Humbert is ultimately surrounded by the equivalent of photographs, corpses, and dead butterflies. He has indeed preserved his independence, by neutralizing the influences that threaten to deprive him of it. Yet his world, however beautiful, is a solipsistic dream, echoing himself back to himself. Still, as Humbert himself argues, this imaginative violence, in its original form, is comparatively harmless. Humbert assures us, after the scene in which he masturbates while Lolita sits on his lap listening to the Carmen record, that "still Lolita was safe-and I was safe. What I had madly possessed was not she, but my own creation." Later, watching, Lolita sleeping at The Enchanted Hunters, he assures us that "The gentle and dreamy regions through which I crept were the patrimonies of poets-not crime's prowling ground." (121) Humbert wishes us to under- stand that, at this point, his crime is nothing more serious than that which the Romantic narcissist perpetrates against the independent reality of the external world. Such a crime, of course, is hardly a crime at all, sanctioned as it is by a great deal of modern literary and artistic tradition. Nabokov has often been accused of writing an immoral book on the grounds that the charm, wit, and imagination with which Humbert transforms the world is such as to seem to excuse what he does to Lolita. There is no question but that our access to Humbert's extraordinary consciousness makes us more sympathetic to him than we would be to anyone else who does what he does. Still, in Humbert's defense of himself in the first part of the book, Nabokov provides us with the moral terms with which we can convict Humbert in the second part of the book. Art, as Humbert recog- nizes in his apologiae, suspends the possibility of gratification in the world. What gratification the artist or aesthete may expect is purely imaginative. Nabokov's critique of Humbert, I believe, focuses on his overstepping of the bounds of art in his appropriation of Lolita. His nympholeptic images degenerate from art into advertising as Humbert comes to believe that he can actually have Lolita in the physical world, not merely in his imagination. Belief in the possibility of the actual possession of an image is, as we have seen, the means by which advertisements reduce people to thralldom. Humbert becomes a thrall to Lolita, losing his "aesthetic" independence when he starts to treat her as a commodity promised by the "advertisement" of his imaginative image. As long as Humbert can draw an analogy between his love for Lolita and a hunchback's love for a film actress, he has some control over his gratification. When Humbert becomes Lolita's lover, he alienates this original power to gratify himself. Humbert can only have the illusion of possessing Lolita by spending a great deal of money to buy things for her. When Lolita becomes, in this process, a commodity, Humbert becomes a consumer. He has left the patrimonies of poets and entered the market- place, as the thrall of a little girl as vulgar, energetic, flirtatious, seemingly innocent and yet manipulative as the American commercial environment itself. When his commodity, as commodities will, takes on a life and independence of her own, he loses the imaginative happiness he enjoyed when he approached her as if she was a piece of art. In Humbert's descent, 19</page><page sequence="7">we can see that just as advertisement is a false double of art in that it deceives a viewer into thinking that an object can be possessed in actuality and not merely in the imagination, consumerism is a false double of aestheticism in that it involves a dependence upon the actual rather than the merely imaginative possession of objects. Humbert loses Lolita to Clare Quilty, a double of himself, a man who physically resembles him and shares his appreciation of little girls, literature, puns, and purple smoking jackets. This motif of doubling can suggest several things. Resembling Humbert so closely and depriving him, ultimately, of his gratification, Quilty may represent a part of Hum- bert himself which finally makes it impossible for Humbert to enjoy what he seems to possess. In his decline from aestheticism to consumerism, Humbert no longer finds the source of his gratification in his imagination. He locates it, rather, in Lolita, an external commoditized object whose independence threatens to deprive him of all gratification. In the context of the thesis I have developed so far, it is possible to understand Quilty as an emblem of this process of alienation. Quilty is the monster, the debased image of Humbert himself, who is created when Humbert seeks gratifi- cation in reality and not in the imagination, and who serves as the agent of the removal of that gratification. In this light, it is significant that Quilty is so clearly identified with mass culture and consumerism. Quilty is a creator of popular culture, he leads a "Hollywood" lifestyle, and he actually appears in an advertisement, the Dromes cigarette ad. A pop-cult American version of Humbert, Quilty lures Lolita with false promises which are the equivalent of the false promises of referentiality made by advertising and popular culture. When he finally has her, Quilty does to Lolita essentially what Humbert did. Yet Quilty had never loved her. For him, she had never been connected with Nabokov's sacred realm of art, that Humbert, by actually possessing Lolita, has profaned. In sum, Quilty may represent Humbert's degeneration, and specifically, the degenera- tion of Humbert's aestheticism into the false double of consumerism. At the end of this book, Humbert kills Quilty and returns Lolita to the realm of art. His aesthetic re-appropriation of her is not, however, identical with his earlier aesthetic image. Included in his aesthetic recrea- tion of his lost love is Humbert's moral realization that by allowing his aestheticism to degenerate into consumerism, he ruined Lolita's child- hood. By coming to view her as an advertised commodity rather than as art, he removed her from the relationships (with parents, friends, normal people, etc.) into which she would have entered independently of him. Humbert recognizes this as his crime when, having killed Quilty, he drives up a grassy slope and waits to be arrested. Sitting in the car, he remembers a day shortly after Lolita's disappearance, when he pulled over to the side of a mountain road and looked out over a small town. Hearing the sounds of children playing, he: stood listening to that musical vibration from my lofty slope, to those flashes of separate cries with a kind of demure murmur for background, and then I know that the hopelessly poignant thing was not Lolita's absence from my side, but the absence of her voice from that concord. (280) 20</page><page sequence="8">As he observes in another moment of roadside meditation, "the melancholy and very local palliative of articulate art" (258) is all that remains to comfort Humbert in his moral misery. Humbert's aesthetic impulse has apparently assumed a new function. Originally a defense against consumerism, it degenerated into a form of it. In the end, Hum- bert the aesthete is able to salvage something of his original defense by expanding the moral scope of his art in order to denounce his own descent from the "patrimonies of the poets" into "crime's prowling grounds." By representing Humbert's fortunate fall, Nabokov reaffirms his own associ- ation of art with "curiosity, tenderness, kindness, ecstasy." In the process he may be warning us of the consequences of living in a culture in which the sinister deceptions of advertising have replaced the harmless decep- tions of art and in which a desperately selfish quest for gratification has replaced the gentle, disinterested gaze of the aesthete. Such a view of modern American culture is perhaps naive in its implicit assumption of the comparative innocence of aestheticism. Perhaps it is impossible to dem- onstrate that aestheticism can ever be anything more than a refined version of consumerism. It may be that the descent from poet to criminal is inevitable. But whatever one thinks of the plausibility of his position, it seems to me that Vladimir Nabokov has offered, in Lolita, one of the most subtle and interesting perspectives we have had on American consumer culture in the middle of the twentieth century.
