<plain_text><page sequence="1">KANGAROO: D. H. LAWRENCE IN TRANSIT Leo Gurko When Lawrence left Europe early in 1922, his art took a new turn. Until then personal relationships had been his main theme. The seven novels from The White Peacock through Aaron's Rod were violent arenas in which men and women struggled for self-realization through a thickening tangle of collisions and fusions. In the last two, The Lost Girl and Aaron's Rod, the protagonists made climactic journeys from England to Italy in search of their elusive happiness,1 but the journeys were subordinate to their emerging selves. Lawrence felt driven from his native continent by the creeping blight of industrialism and by what he regarded as the psychic atrophy that accompanied it. His departure coincided with the end of the strictly personal phase of his writing. His voyage to the other side of the world corresponded externally to a change in inner direction. His later novels are increasing explorations of landscape, religion, and mythology, and their principal figures are, increasingly, in search of something larger than themselves. It is not enough for them to stand in some kind of tensioned balance with others—the ideal of the earlier narratives which came to its climax in the titanic conflicts of Women In Love. They now seek to meld with the spirits and gods of place. Growingly explicit in the later work is a complex animism whose roots were easier for Lawrence to discover in Ceylon, Australia, and Mexico than in mechanized, urbanized Europe. The first of these new departures, and in some ways the most rami fied, is Kangaroo. Its very title suggests Lawrence's trend away from the purely human. The center of this novel about Australia is not any given group of Australians but the country itself. The same non human principle will be true of The Plumed Serpent, St. Mawr, and The Escaped Cock, celebrated pieces that followed. Animals tend to replace human beings in these later titles and are emblematic of countries, clusters of belief, or ritualistic patterns with which they become synonymous. The Australian national animal introduces us at once to Australia as a continent, just as the central figure, nick 1 They land in appropriately different parts of Italy: Alvina and her peasant Italian lover in a remote mountain village south of Rome; Aaron and his intellectual alter ego, Lilly, in Florence. 349</page><page sequence="2">named Kangaroo, introduces us to Australia as a society. The move ment of the story is from persons to politics to place; in the end it is the weirdly exciting quality of Australia itself that takes hold of Lawrence's imagination and defines the tale. The Lawrences reached Australia in May 1922. The novel was begun in June and, except for the final chapter written later in New Mexico, finished in July.2 In August Lawrence and Frieda left Australia for good. They seem to have met few Australians and en gaged in very little social life. "We had no human contacts all these months: a strange experience: nobody bothered about us," wrote Frieda.3 Lawrence was free to absorb the atmosphere of the country unrefracted by human involvements. In the novel that emerged, the country controlled the characters and was indeed the source from which they grew. Lawrence breathed the qualities of the land into the people—a kind of anthropomorphism in reverse. This is the novel's central principle. It proves powerful enough to hold together a narrative which otherwise seems a fragmented hodgepodge of odds and ends. Kangaroo has generally been read from the wrong end, as in essence an ideological novel of politics and power. Julian Moynahan calls it "the most padded and redundant of Lawrence's novels," "a shape less, wandering narrative." He is outraged by Somers' silence in the face of Jack's murders, calls him a revolutionary simpleton and self indulgent blockhead,4 and scarcely mentions the fact that the novel takes place in Australia. It might just as well have been set in Timbuktu. Harry T. Moore's opinion is exactly the reverse of Moynahan's. To him Kangaroo, one of Lawrence's "leadership" novels, is superbly written and "a momentous statement of the predicament of civilized man in the twentieth century." It is not really a novel, but "a special 2 Richard Aldington is dazzled by Lawrence's speed: "The writing of Kangaroo was an extraordinary tour de force of rapid composition, comparable with the almost miraculous creation of Guy Mannering in six weeks" ("Introduction," Kangaroo, London, 1955, p. vii). A better comparison, perhaps, would be with Stendhal's writing of La Chartreuse de Parme during a seven-week period in 1838 (Matthew Josephson, Stendhal, New York, 1946, p. 419). '"Not I, But The Wind . . (New York, 1934), p. 120. In a letter to Mrs. A. L. Jenkins on May 28, 1922, Lawrence wrote: . . we don't know a soul: nor want to" (Letters of D. H. Lawrence, ed. with an Introduction by Aldous Huxley, New York, 1932, p. 554). On July 9, 1922, in a letter to S. S. Koteliansky: "We don't know one single soul—not a soul comes to the house. And I can't tell you how I like it. I could live like that forever . . (Quoted in Edward Nehls, D. H. Lawrence: a Composite Biography [Madison, Wisconsin, 1958], II, 157). And in a letter to Mrs. Brewster, July 24, 1922: "We haven't known a single soul here—which is really a relief. I feel if I lived all my life in Australia I should never know anybody—though they are all very friendly. But one feels one doesn't want to talk to any of them" (Earl and Achsah Brewster, D. H. Lawrence: Reminiscences and Correspondence, London, 1934, p. 59). 4 The Deed of Life (Princeton, N.J., 1963), pp. 101, 102, 105-106. 350 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">kind of book, like the work of Carlyle or Nietzsche."5 Moore is aware of "the life of nature" in the book, but it and the "man-made world" simply exist side by side in his discussion without coalescing or enter ing into any visible connection with one another. Eliseo Vivas has attacked Kangaroo savagely as a tool of Lawrence's "ideas" and an attempt to exorcise its author's personal conflicts. In his opinion it is disorganized, padded, "feels" too much like an autobiography, is full of "corn," has too much "eros" and not enough "agape," and gives a distorted account of the war hysteria in the Nightmare section. Vivas thinks Willie Struthers' "mate" principle pure homosexuality and regards the characters as "pseudo," as mere mouthpieces for the writer; the book has no workmanship and no unity; it presents a vision of the cosmos that is "chaotic, incoherent, evil." It is really a "no-novel." Still, he concludes, Lawrence "comes close to bringing it off" and "I am also ready to acknowledge that from an aesthetic point of view it cannot be condemned without qualification."« This is a baffling turnabout after twenty-five pages of unqualified condemnation. Yet it is a singular testimonial to the power of the novel even when approached from the wrong end. Other readers have gone off on tangents of their own. Mary Free man has plowed through Kangaroo doggedly, searching for Lawrence's attitudes on social and political questions.7 There are plenty to be found, though by themselves they supply few clues to the novel's central purpose. Graham Hough, searching hard for a unifying ele ment, was convinced he had found it, as has Moore, in the theme of power.8 Although he discusses this intelligently, he is left in the end with the Australian background dangling loosely. What to do with this loose end is a problem Hough solves by simply admiring it. . . he [Lawrence] was faced with a new continent, and, something he had never seen before, a country largely untouched by man. He half fell in love with it. . . . At the end, Somers and Harriet forget the human entanglements and, enchanted by this virgin beauty, almost want to stay. The radiant, quivering sense of the life of nature, enfolding and flowing through the life of man, pervades Kangaroo."9 In these sentences the heart of the book is at last touched upon, but as an afterthought outside the main business of the novel. Aldington has sensed the import of the Australian influence more forcefully; ". . . it must be insisted that, with all its other achievements, the supreme » The Life and Works of D. H.

HUCKLEBERRY FINN 351</page><page sequence="4">achievement of Kangaroo lies in its unforgettably vivid and accurate pictures of the Australian continent, in which no other English writer has approached Lawrence."10 These are more than pictures, however vivid and accurate; they are the imaginative source of all the desultory, separate, seemingly miscellaneous elements: the char acters and their private lives, the question of power, the question of marriage, the political entanglements, the Nightmare chapter, and the rambling speculations about love, friendship, matiness, and the dark god. In the opening chapter Somers, an English writer through whose consciousness the story unfolds, arrives in Sydney. The surrounding country impresses him with its flatness and lowness. The harbor cliffs are "squat" and "the low table-land into which the harbour intrudes squatted dark-looking and monotonous and sad, as if lost on the face of the earth."1! The squatting landscape suggests the characteristic posture of the kangaroo. There is a pervasive lack of dimension. At night Sydney "didn't seem to be real, it seemed to be sprinkled on the surface of a darkness into which it never penetrated" (p. 8). Somers observes the absence of height in all directions: seaward the Pacific stretches to the horizon, sparkling and low-lying; inland is the almost equally endless bush with its stumpy vegetation hugging the ground, "the sun-refusing leaves of the gum trees that are like dark, hardened flakes of rubber" (p. 14). The impression is repeated throughout: "That curious sombreness of Australia . . . with the forms all worn down low and blunt, squat. The squat-seeming earth" (p. 73). The flatness of the earth seems to mold the lives and institutions of the Australians. Jack Callcott, the aggressive young Australian work man, remarks about his compatriots: " 'Prop us up on a dozen stumps, and we're cosy. ... Just a little above the earth level, and no higher, you know. Australians in their heart of hearts hate anything but a bungalow. They feel it's rock bottom, don't you see. None of your stair-climbing shams and upstairs importance' " (p. 107). The social life of the Australians has the same horizontal quality: ". . . nobody felt better than anybody else, or higher; only better-off" (p. 16). There are no class distinctions as in Europe, and indeed few distinctions of any kind.12 The lack of distinctiveness produces an inability to discriminate among experiences: "Anything was as good as anything else" (p. 62). Even Australian manners are marked by an equality that oppresses Somers: "He hated the promiscuous mixing in of all 10 "Introduction," p. x. a Kangaroo (London, 1955), p. 5. All page references in the text are to this edition.

A similar spirit controls the country's politics. Australian democracy is as flat and undifferentiated as the landscape. " 'We don't like to have anybody overhead here,' " observes Kangaroo (p. 107). No power is delegated to the leaders,13 but remains formless and fixed in the mass. No distinction or stratification exists between the elected and the electorate, so that political life has the same monotone, one-di mensional quality as the bush. Somers is attracted by its free and easy pace, and oppressed by the absence of individuality. Since in politics individuality expresses itself in leaders with power, i.e. in men who really lead and followers who are really led, he is at tracted to the principle of power. This brings him, through Jack, to Kangaroo, and sets the novel into motion on the political side. The country is not only flat. It is also peculiarly empty, and empti ness becomes another of the dimensions manipulating the material and shaping the life of the book. Jack is "always aware of the big empty spaces of his own consciousness; like his country, a vast empty 'desert' at the centre of him" (p. 36). The landscape is "like a face with little or no features" (p. 73) and breeds human beings "mindless as opossums" (p. 21). The country is "all crumpled out into form lessness" (p. 21), and Sydney itself, a vast sprawl of a city, is "without any core or pith of meaning" (p. 22). To Harriet Somers, Australia "feels as if no one had ever loved it," as if the land had "never come out into the open" (p. 74). To Somers "the continent of the Kangaroo reassumed its strange, unvisited glamour, a kind of virgin sensual aloofness" (p. 27), quite as if its destiny had not yet reached its first consummation. The society produced by this emptiness is unavoidably hollow. Friendship and love in Australia are "just a series of disconnected, isolated moments" (pp. 54-55). Walking into town with Jack Callcott, Somers is struck by how many people Jack knows and the breezy intimacy with which he greets all of them, yet "the moment they had passed by, they didn't exist for him any more than the gull that had curved across in the air" (p. 54). The empty spaces of Australia are reflected in the empty spaces within its inhabitants: "Somers always came again upon this gap in the other man's continuity" (p. 55). Nothing has any "real pip in it," not even the pursuit of money. "Money is a means to rising to a higher, subtler, fuller state of con sciousness, or nothing. And when you flatly don't want a fuller u . . in Australia nobody is supposed to rule, and nobody does rule. . . . The proletariat appoints men to administer the law, not to rule. These ministers are not really responsible, any more than the housemaid is responsible" (p. 16). HUCKLEBERRY FINN 353</page><page sequence="6">consciousness, what good is your money to you?" (p. 22). The last thing in the world the Australians crave is a "fuller consciousness." Therefore, all their freedom has a terrifying vacancy (p. 21). "You never knew anything so nothing, nichts, nullus, niente, as the life here," Lawrence wrote to his sister-in-law Else on June 13, 1922. "They are always vaguely and meaninglessly on the go. And it all seems so empty, so nothing. . . . That's what the life in a new country does to you: it makes you so material, so outward, that your real inner life and your inner self dies out, and you clatter round like so many mechanical animals."14 Somers expresses the same idea in an outburst to Kangaroo: " 'Look at these Australians—they're awfully nice, but they've got no inside to them. They're hollow. . . . They're marvellous and manly and independent and all that, outside. But in side, they are not. When they're quite alone, they don't exist' " (p. 130). But the final impression made by Australia is its air of mystery. In the opening chapter Somers recalls a slightly nightmarish, alto gether electrifying encounter he had in the bush one night. With exactly what he is unsure. There was nothing there, yet he felt the overwhelming sensation of being watched by some dark spirit or other he could not define. The sense of the bush being alive under its surface appearance of deadness at once terrifies him and floods him with an emanation of place. This lurking aliveness runs through the whole of the novel that follows and surges forth in the final chapter when he describes "The frail, wonderful Australian spring, coming out of all the gummy hardness and sombreness of the bush" (p. 364). There is a tremendous outburst of yellow mimosa, heath plants, and bottle-brush trees, the untouched blue sky overhead becomes filled with the cries of strange, brilliant birds, and the air is suddenly saturated with perfume. The bush bursts into golden flame, "flower ing at the gates of heaven" (p. 363). Somers and his wife, now leaving Australia, are seized with a last-minute desire to remain. But they depart for the new world "over a cold, dark, inhospitable sea," leaving behind the strange continent with its mysterious soul crouching under an unrevealing surface. This idea of a deceptive exterior that hides another principle within is reflected in the characters. Both Jack Callcott and Kangaroo have concealed selves which leap at Somers from emotional ambush. Jack is abstracted, curiously inert on the surface, while underneath is buried "a deep flow of loose energy . . . ready to break out like a geyser" (p. 183). Kangaroo oozes charm at first, and espouses the 14 "Not I, But The Wind . . p. 130. 354 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">principle of love as the cure-all for Australia's social ills, but behind the charm and the love-principle there lies a vindictive hate of which Somers becomes the target when he refuses to accept Kangaroo's in vitation to join him. As creations of the landscape, the human figures are always pulled back toward it. They are linked with animals and set in animal frames. Kangaroo announces, only half-jokingly, that he is not a man but a kangaroo (p. 116). Just before his meeting with Harriet Somers, there is a prelude in which Jack tells Somers a story of how a tiger-cat tore a kangaroo to pieces. Harriet, described as a dangerous ogre, presently rips and tears at Kangaroo. He describes himself messian ically as "a fat old Kangaroo with ... a pouch to carry young Australia in" (p. 118) and later, when shot in the abdomen, writes that he re ceived the bullets in his marsupial pouch (p. 329). At various times he is elevated to a mythological level15 and referred to as a phoenix or a unicorn. Even as a kangaroo, he is so unique that no female of his particular species exists. He organizes a semi-military, quasi fascist organization called the Diggers. His chief assistant is the Emu, and the men are trained in squads called Magpies or Butcher Birds. Jack Callcott also goes through animal transmutations: "... when he broke into a little volley of speech, you listened with wonder at the noise of it, as if a weird animal had suddenly given voice" (p. 182). He too has his kangaroo aspect ("a long-faced, smooth-faced, strangely watchful kangaroo") and observes, " 'I go at it in jumps like a kanga roo. I feel I could jump clean through the blooming tent canvas some times' " (p. 103). Somers himself feels "like an animal that is being lassoed" (p. 92) and longs to escape his human frame into almost anything non-human. He wants to be a gannet, a hawk, a kite (p. 138). In his revulsion against the "horribly stuffy heat of human beings," he yearns for the icy energy, the coldness and dumbness of a fish (p. 124). What he is really after is "non-human gods, non human human beings" (p. 349). What he really wants is to get as far away from humanity as possible: " 'I try to kid myself that I care about mankind and its destiny. And I have fits of wistful love for the working men. But at the bottom I'm as hard as a mango nut. "He is also a Jew, though his doctrine of love is overtly Christian. He is indeed a kind of synthesized Jew-Christian, which is perhaps why he jocularly refers to the Jews as God's "half-chosen people." His real name, Ben Cooley, may also be relevant. Benjamin establishes him as Jacob's youngest son (as Australia is the youngest continent) and one of the original twelve tribes. Cooley, or coulee, is a plain reference to his personality. Words and magnetism do pour out of him like a stream of molten lava. There may also be some connection between Cooley and Coo-ee, the name of the cottage occupied by the Somerses. The house is called Coo-ee, Jack explains, "to fetch the rats in" (p. 81). Kangaroo refers to *' 'our heaven-inspired scheme of saving Australia from the dingoes, rabbits, rats and starlings, humanly speaking' " (p. 118). The two names, echoing one another, link Somers and Kangaroo in still another instance and supply Lawrence with another opportunity to reel off one of his animal catalogues. HUCKLEBERRY FINN 355</page><page sequence="8">I don't care about them all. I don't really care about anything' " (p. 206). The themes and narrative details of the novel acquire a special focus from their connections with the Australian earth. " 'Every continent has its own way, and its own needs,' " remarks Soraers (p. 110),16 thereby expressing the ultimate meaning of the book. The struggle for political power between the labor unions, led by Willie Struthers, and the Diggers, headed by Kangaroo, is between two virtually indistinguishable ideologies. In an eloquent speech that extends for six pages (pp. 314-320), Willie expounds the principle of matiness, the proletarian equivalent of Kangaroo's love. The sameness of the two establishes their common citizenship. Despite their formal rivalry, as Australians they are the same in the eyes of the foreigner Somers. Each tries to win him over, but he re jects both and for the same reasons. He espouses the principle of multiplicity and shrinks at the emotional uniformity (however warm and cheerful) the Australian power groups would impose. As an Englishman and a European, passing through as it were and in stinctively resolved not to stay, he espouses differences and degrees, and is repelled by the flatness and oneness, just as he is flattered by the deference and admiration, of his Australian friends. Throughout, Kangaroo, Struthers, and Callcott have not the re motest idea of what Somers is talking about when he repudiates their respective brands of Australian chumminess in the name of the dark god.17 He must keep his theological thoughts to himself: "The God must be unknown. Once you have defined or described him, he is the most chummy of pals. . . . And once you've chummed up with your God, you'll never be alone again, poor you. For that's the end of you. You and your God chumming it through time and eternity" (p. 288). The gulf between these products of different continents is dramatized on Kangaroo's deathbed when for the last time the dying Australian begs the living Englishman for love, an appeal that Somers denies as destructive of his own deepest feelings. Somers brings with him from England marital problems and private nightmares which the Australian atmosphere exposes with peculiar clarity. He does not want equality in his marriage. He thinks of himself and Harriet not as one but two, with himself established »Lawrence had already put forth the same idea in the well-known passage from Studies in Classic American Literature: "Every continent has its own great spirit of place. . . . Different places on the face of the earth have different vital effluence, different vibration, different chemical exhalation, different polarity with different stars: call it what you like. But the spirit of place is a great reality" (New York, 1955), p. 16. "The reader can sympathize with their blankness on the subject since the dark god is likely to leave him pretty blank as well. Yet Hough is surely right in suggesting that its vagueness does not automatically turn it into "a piece of portentous flummery." Law rence, he argues, is using Kangaroo as a means of defining the concept (The Dark Sun, p. 114). 356 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">as lord and master. He cannot get her to accept this inequality any more than Birkin was able to with Ursula. He is also driven by an indefinable, unsatisfied restlessness into relationships with other men or with the public world from which women are excluded. Why aren't we enough for you?, Lawrence's women perpetually cry out to their husbands and lovers. The emotional uniformity of Australia exacerbates Somers' will to marital differentiation, and produces a series of quarrels with Harriet even more rousing than their equiva lent in Women In Love. Harriet gives as good as she takes, and Somers is as often the butt of effective ridicule as he is the persuasive expounder of male supremacy. Two of Lawrence's great claims as a serious writer are demonstrated in this context: his uncanny sensi tivity to the female temperament and his responsiveness to viewpoints to which he is personally hostile. Another of the European problems Somers brings to Australia is his traumatic experience during the War. The painful memories of his humiliations in England as a non-combatant married to a Ger man wife are set into motion by his contact with Kangaroo and pour forth in a fifty-page chapter, "The Nightmare" (Ch. 12), midway through the novel. At the root of Somers' anguish is the violation of his privacy: government agents spying on his movements, police officers breaking in to search his belongings, army doctors examining his naked body. When Kangaroo's rejected offer of love turns to hate, when he lunges at Somers menacingly, the whole nightmare of the war comes back in a rush. It is Kangaroo's threat to his privacy, to that separate self which is an ultimate canon of Lawrence's faith, that brings back the earlier anguish. In recall, Somers relives the acts of humiliation with an intensity equal to the original, a process guai&gt; anteed by the livid face of Kangaroo triggering the nightmare. In Europe his inner self had been invaded, which was bad enough. In Australia, with its uncreated, unformed life, his inner self is being denied. He finds this far worse. Somers also ascribes the return of his black nightmare anger to the inversion of the seasons in Australia, an inversion which may well be a "shock to his blood and his system" (p. 266). Here is the influence of place in its purest ecological form. The novel is also filled with bits and pieces of journalism, chiefly items from Sydney newspapers. These record events in Australia and document its life. The first extended quotation describes Australian earthquakes and volcanoes (pp. 167-170). The instability of the earth suggests the instability of the characters—Kangaroo with his alterna tion between love and hate, Jack veering from a friendly "pal" to a killer who finds putting men to death as natural as making love to women (p. 327)—and is another reference to the land itself as a center HUCKLEBERRY FINN 357</page><page sequence="10">of human activity. The second journalistic insert comes immediately after the frenzy of the nightmare sequence and gives the reader a chance to catch his breath and return to normal. Here Somers is stitching together miscellaneous fragments from the Sydney Bulletin, most of them dealing with animals and aborigines (pp. 274-277). They are lively if unconnected bits of the Australian experience, "the sheer momentaneous life of the continent" (p. 277). In this very current of mindless energy, moving along without form but also without muddle, the soul of the country is plainly revealed. It serves to release Somers from the tormented feelings he has carried with him from Europe, and he now cheerfully curses himself for all "his frantic struggles with the 'soul' and the 'dark god' " (p. 277). Thus the nightmare set into motion by Kangaroo is finally set to rest by the surface flow of events that reflect the amorphous quality of Australia. The new country jars against his European consciousness until Somers is knocked loose from his familiar responses. In the end he works his way past the rough edges of this strange experience and comes to understand Australia, to love her, and almost to settle in her for good. Only the deep pull of America urges him away from this resolve. The last chapter of Kangaroo, "Adieu Australia," gives off the dense ambience of a fulfilled emotion. Lawrence spent two weeks in Ceylon, three months in Australia, and three years in the Mexicos, Old and New. "He travelled," says Frieda, "because he wanted to see what the world was like in other places, not because he was the hunted, haunted man running away from himself."18 He found in continents outside Europe not only sights to feed his curiosity but sources of human experience to nourish his art. The "boneless suavity" of Ceylon may have nauseated him, as he claimed,19 but Australia exercised a complex and powerful attraction upon him. "I love Australia," he wrote, "its weird, far away natural beauty and its remote, almost coal-age pristine quality. . . . Australia seems to me a most marvellous country to disappear into. ... It is a land where one can go out of life."20 This "going out of life," in the sense of breaking free of personal relationships, provides Kangaroo with its central impulse, an impulse rooted in the character of Australia. The novel was the first of Lawrence's massive explorations of vital energy outside the strictly human scene. As he moved over the physical face of the earth, he sought to penetrate it psychically. Kangaroo has as its hero and con trolling element nothing less than the shape of a continent. MFrieda Lawrence: The Memoirs and Correspondence, ed. E. W. Tedlock (London, 1961), p. 131.
