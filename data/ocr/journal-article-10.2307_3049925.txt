Then came University Microfilms and the enterprise that gave dissertations a par- tial professional status by making them available to distant writers pursuing related investigations. And now, along has come Garland Publishing, reducing still further the gap be- tween graduate and professional scholarship. With the in- auguration in 1975 of its first series of "outstanding disser- tations in the fine arts," Garland promised to make more widely available important scholarship by exceptional grad- uate students. The publisher's intention to insert these stud-</page><page sequence="2">486 THE ART BULLETIN ies into the mainstream of art-historical literature is demon- strated by the selection process: leading American scholars were asked to recommend dissertations that "would have been published by university presses and art publishers in the affluent 1960's." Scholarship so positioned by its pub- lisher and its referees deserves, then, straightforward critical scrutiny, with no allowances made for youth or inexperience. Garland's books hold a technical edge over University Mi- crofilms' Xerographic copies. The books have entered the card catalogues under subject headings, making their fortui- tous discovery infinitely more likely. The pool of doctorate- granting institutions is broadened to include Harvard, a major university that does not participate in the Ann Arbor program. The Garland publications are, however, more ex- pensive than those of University Microfilms, costing one half again as much, or more. This is partly justified by Garland's use of more durable paper and more legible illustrations, although the physical difference between the texts in the two publishers' formats is slight since both consist of photo- copied typescript, reduced in size and difficult to read. Is Garland's series more valuable for making available work of superior quality? Its list of outstanding dissertations has now swelled to a third series of 142 books. As the project threatens to become exhaustive, it increasingly resembles the totally democratic University Microfilms, and its original elitist premise is substantially undermined. In my opinion, the venture would have been more distinguished if conceived as a smaller set, a genuinely elite selection, and if published as printed books, better illustrated and properly indexed. Gar- land, however, has undoubtedly found its market in univer- sity libraries, and as long as libraries routinely acquire books but not Xerographic copies, there is no reason, from Gar- land's point of view, not to extend the series indefinitely. The three books here under review all concern aspects of Italian Renaissance sculpture, a field of art history that re- mains somewhat neglected. For that reason, one welcomes the appearance of the titles; in two cases, however, the re- sults are very disappointing. In a dissertation of 1972 for Columbia University, Jane Schuyler promises the first sys- tematic investigation of the origin and purpose of the quatro- cento portrait bust. She delivers instead an arbitrarily fo- cused study, alternately visionary and pedestrian, whose central theses are very dubious indeed. The trouble begins in the first chapter, when the writer flatly asserts that Flor- entine portrait busts "are not studies of individual person- alities and give no indication of temperament, foibles or neu- roses." Rather, she says, they stress good character and "present one type, moderate, benevolent, disciplined." To demonstrate, Schuyler compares three busts by Mino da Fiesole, those of Niccol6 Strozzi, Piero de' Medici, and Dio- tisalvi Neroni (Piero's attempted assassin), and finds them all essentially the same, with no expressive distinction between the "good" Piero and the "bad" Diotisalvi. But what would one expect? Diotisalvi's bust would not have been commis- sioned by an enemy! Schuyler ignores the obvious consider- ation of patronage as it affects character portrayal, even though she devotes a great deal of space to the purposes and uses of sculptured busts. Schuyler's categoric approach precludes recognition of in- dividual differences, the very thing one would expect to have interested her. In this particular group of three busts there are significant variations among the subjects: Diotisalvi smiles and is dressed all'antica, Piero scowls and wears con- temporary clothes, Niccol6's bust combines these elements. So graphic a differentiation of personalities by the same artist urges a connection with the body of theory in which physiognomy reflects character type.' In Della pittura, Alberti contended that in the melancholy person, the forehead is wrinkled, in the angry, the eyes are swollen, and so on. In two treatises on physiognomy that were known in the Ren- aissance and attributed to Aristotle (works assumed by Schuyler without explanation to have been ignored in the 15th century), shapes and sizes of faces were considered im- portant keys to character. She notes that Pliny the Elder was widely read in the quattrocento, even quoting his observation that "everyone should always have the desire to know what sort of person a certain individual was," and could learn this from studying his portrait. Yet in Schuyler's view, Floren- tines were content to know their contemporaries only to the extent that they conformed to a homogenized version of Al- bertian virtui. Central to the history of the quattrocento portrait bust is the question, who introduced the genre into Florence and when? Schuyler rejects the presently held view that Mino da Fiesole was the innovator in this field, turning instead to Donatello, the candidate of earlier scholars. Her claim, if sub- stantiated, would indeed be a major contribution to Renais- sance studies, but her arguments are extremely unsound. We must dismiss as a classic faulty syllogism her suggestion that Donatello ought to have done portrait busts because they are an antique type and he was known for his interest in the antique. Schuyler's case for Donatello rests largely upon her acceptance of the identification of the terracotta bust in the Bargello as Niccolo da Uzzano, who died in 1433, and of its 18th-century attribution to Donatello. She offers weak cir- cumstantial evidence, such as the fact that Niccol6's mother was related to Donatello, and the observation that the fig- ure's sunken eyes resemble those of the artist's Magdalene in the Baptistery at Florence. Nowhere does she directly ad- dress the numerous, persuasive arguments of the many scholars who have rejected both the Niccolo identification and the Donatello attribution, including Ciardi Dupre, Schlegel, Lanyi, Planiscig, and Janson. The frequent appearance of Donatello attributions among individualized busts reflects a widespread belief that Dona- tello's interest in psychic expression must have spilled into portraiture, an expectation voiced by Pope-Hennessy inltal- ian Renaissance Sculpture when he says that "logically the reanimator of the portrait bust should have been Donatello." This seems to me to misrepresent the nature of Donatello's genius. The bronze David, the Judith, the Campanile Abraham are masterpieces of psychological complexity, but they are not specific individual personalities; rather, they are heroic archetypes emotionally particularized by the sculptor, some- what like a certain actor's interpretation of Hamlet or Lear. Donatello's ability to turn an abstract type into a hauntingly 1 See Peter Meller, "Physiognomical Theory in Renaissance Heroic Portraits," The Renaissance and Mannerism: Studies in Western Art: Acts of the Twentieth International Congress of the History of Art, Princeton, 1963, II, 53f., and Philipp Fehl, "On the Representation of Character in Renaissance Sculpture," Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, Spring, 1973, 291f.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 487 complex persona bespeaks a talent for making creative use of the observation of human nature, but not necessarily an in- terest in recording the physiognomies of living individuals. Schuyler is least equipped to provide what is most needed in a study of the portrait bust: fresh critical analysis of our working assumptions. Having promised to revise some interpretations of Pope-Hennessy and Irving Lavin, the prin- cipal modern scholars who have examined portrait busts from a conceptual point of view,2 she confines her criticism to minor factual corrections. For instance, Schuyler demon- strates that, contrary to an assertion by Lavin, many if not most Renaissance busts were displayed on bases. This obser- vation weakens Lavin's theory that the totus homo (the term is used by Manetti and Luther), or the complete individual plus his individual potential, is consciously evoked in the bust without a base, a "deliberate fragment" that called to mind the whole through its arbitrary termination and con- nection with its setting. Schuyler, however, makes no at- tempt to carry the discussion beyond the facts, and retains the notion that the totus homo was an intentional allusion of the portrait bust. Tougher questions might be asked of Lavin. With the traditions of antique busts and medieval reliquaries behind it, could the Renaissance portrait bust really have appeared to contemporary viewers to represent less than the whole man, if not justified in some special way? Schuyler's dissertation is not entirely without merit. There are useful discussions of the roles of life and death masks in the creation of busts, and she includes, albeit arbitrarily, a fascinating final chapter on fakes and forgeries of Renais- sance busts, with appropriate emphasis on the career of the 19th-century forger, Giovanni Bastianini. Yet these contri- butions are heavily offset by flaws and weaknesses. There is careless scholarship, such as her perpetuation of the old at- tribution to Verrocchio of the National Gallery bust of Lor- enzo de' Medici, an attribution persuasively refuted by Pas- savant in 1969. There is a long and tedious chapter on the antecedents of the Renaissance bust, which takes us from the Neolithic Jericho heads through the Middle Ages in an overly detailed history which sorely needs firm conceptual shaping to establish its relevance to the quattrocento situation. Such flaws could be ignored in a study that presented sound orig- inal ideas. What is disturbing here is that a methodologically unsound dissertation should have been chosen by Garland as one of the first 34 "outstanding" ones. Let me illustrate with a summary of Schuyler's argument for a proposal de- scribed by author and publisher as one of the dissertation's two most important contributions, namely, her discovery of new evidence for the identification as a portrait of Ginevra de' Benci of the Bargello Lady with the Flowers, attributed to Verrocchio. Schuyler finds support for this identification in a poem of about 1476 written by Alessandro Braccesi and addressed to his patron, Bernardo Bembo, who was Ginevra's lover. A description of Ginevra in the poem shares with the bust three presumably telltale features: fingers, flowers, and breasts. Leaping from the poem's possible dependence on the bust, which requires the identification of violets without aid of color, Schuyler discovers Ginevra's image again in Bot- ticelli's Birth of Venus, in the Hora of Spring who rushes in from the right. Proof that this figure doubles as Ginevra de' Benci is found in the blue flowers on the garment she carries and the violet ones in the tree behind her. The association between the Horae and flowers, however, goes back to Ovid. Besides, if violets were Ginevra's unmistakable emblem, one wonders why Leonardo made such a point of the juniper connection. Finally, if, as Schuyler asserts, Ginevra's inclu- sion in the Birth of Venus was meant to provide Bembo, Gi- nevra's "knight," with a living guide to the higher sphere of love (as recommended by Landino in a poem of the same time), would it now follow that it must have been Bembo rather than Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici for whom Botticelli painted the picture? Yet documents confirm that it was the latter. Schuyler does not see this as a problem, and neither does she make any effort to reconcile her new inter- pretation of the Birth of Venus with any of the existing icon- ographic analyses by Warburg, Panofsky, Gombrich, Wind, et al. We have too many conflicting interpretations of Botti- celli's mythologies as it is. The least one can expect of yet another one is that it be compatible with one of the older interpretations, or else afford a new comprehensive view. Virginia Bush's dissertation of 1967, also for Columbia University, is the best of the three books reviewed here. Like Schuyler, she focuses upon a class of sculptures, in this case colossal statues of the cinquecento, a choice that leads her likewise to deal with monuments commemorating individu- als. Bush, however, is considerably more sensitive to the role of patronage. Indeed, she distinguishes three types of prop- aganda manifested in 16th-century colossal statues, and these three categories define the subjects of the last three of her six chapters. The first three chapters are also well conceived; the first offers a broad but precisely formulated overview, the second is devoted to technical and aesthetic problems, and the third to surviving antique colossi, a legacy of overwhelm- ing importance for the 16th-century colossus. Bush begins by tracing the term "colossus" back to pre- Hellenic origins, when it had nothing to do with size but referred to statuettes of ritual significance. First attached to large-scale statues in connection with the Colossus of Rhodes, the term began after 304 B.C. to be used exclusively for over- sized statues. The measure-conscious writers of the Renais- sance gave the colossus a more precise definition: a figure of extraordinary size was defined as colossal only when mea- suring three times lifesize, according to Pomponius Gauricus and Cellini. Bush accepts as colossal anything twice lifesize or over, as did later cinquecento writers. Her intention is to redress neglect of this category of Renaissance sculpture, a neglect that derives from the failure of art historians to un- derstand "the aesthetic criteria that the works presuppose and the symbolic importance they held for their contempo- raries." Whereas most writers have treated colossi as vulgar aberrants in the oeuvre of Michelangelo, Giambologna, and others, Bush provides a new, positive perspective, examining the colossal statue from the viewpoint of the motivating ar- tistic and political ideas behind it. One of the desiderata for a clossus was that it be monolithic. Pliny claimed that the Laocoon and the Farnese Bull were each carved from a single piece of marble, even though they were not, and the same erroneous assertion was made by other 2 J. Pope-Hennessy devotes chapters to the portrait bust in Italian Renaissance Sculpture, London, 1958, revd., 1971; and in The Portrait in the Renaissance, Washington, D.C., 1963.

This exaggerated respect for the organic wholeness of the block was carried into Renaissance theory and, when possible, practice. Al- though Bush interprets the attitude as an expression of val- uation of a precious commodity, like the farmer's attitude toward the land, one is also reminded that the idea of a uni- tary block enhances the animistic echo that survives in Ren- aissance sculpture and is so often alluded to in Renaissance topoi, the sense that the sculpture contains a living presence. The effect of anthropomorphic presence is, of course, radi- cally intensified in a colossus, and Bush properly emphasizes that the primary aesthetic effect of a colossal statue is the sense of its extraordinary size in relation to our own, provok- ing feelings of marvel and awe. She discusses the implica- tions of bulk, pointing out that "a colossus twice the height of a man has eight times the volume." Especially useful for the student of Renaissance sculpture is her discussion of the problems of proportion and compensatory perspective ad- justment, which were much more difficult for the colossus than for normal-sized sculpture. Another virtue of Bush's change of focus is that her own insights stimulate the reader to ask new questions and to see familiar monuments in a different light. For instance, it is evident from her account that the colossi of antiquity were known throughout the Middle Ages, and were used as sources of inspiration by artists a full century before sculptors began to emulate their scale. Why were there no quattrocento co- lossi, apart from those destined for architectural settings? The question deserves better than an orthodox W61fflinian response. Bush recognizes the pivotal importance of Michel- angelo for the history of the Renaissance colossus, for in the first two decades of the 16th century he made three colossi and planned several others. The colossal scale of the marble David and its dependence on several colossal antique proto- types have been duly acknowledged in the literature. Yet re- cent discussions of the placement of the David have centered on the political implications of the change of site from a but- tress of the Cathedral to the Piazza Signoria.3 No one, not even Seymour, seems entirely to have grasped that possibly the most important result of the relocation of the David was its transformation through that act into a colossus in the antique sense. It is not clear from the record of deliberations of January, 1504, who first thought of moving the statue from its intended location at the Duomo, where it would not have seemed oversized, to the square, where it became a unique, isolated giant. Bush's shift of emphasis obliges us, however, to reconsider the question of Michelangelo's own influence on the proceedings, and the possibility that the decision may have been affected as much by aesthetic as political concerns, given his preoccupation with colossi around this time. How else can we interpret Condivi's story of Michelangelo in Car- rara in 1505, fantasizing the carving of a large mountain into a colossus? But whether or not the new aesthetic character of the David was understood before it was placed in front of the Palazzo Vecchio, once there the statue created a new stan- dard of reference for normal-sized sculpture. Thereafter, merely to match the David's size, and everyone did, was no longer marvelous but ordinary. Having been stimulated by Bush's line of thinking to see these points, I cannot then accept her classification of a num- ber of works as colossi. Cellini's Perseus is not a colossus, since it does not attempt to surpass the David in scale, as did Bandinelli's Hercules and Cacus and Ammanati's Neptune. Similarly, when a work is created for a large architectural setting, it loses its individual power to provoke marvel, and thus the 16th-century statues designed for the S. Lorenzo facade, along with Michelangelo's bronze Julius II at S. Petronio, Bologna, should not form part of this study, or at least should be differentiated. In a rich and informative sec- tion on the colossal statues collected on the Capitoline, Bush argues that Michelangelo put together the Marcus Aurelius, the River Gods, his planned Jupiter, the balustrade statues, to make "everything ... larger than life." But when everything is colossal, nothing seems so, as she elsewhere explains about St. Peter's. By the same token, many antique colossi, the Marforio, the Quirinal Horsetamers, the Marcus Aurelius, were not really gigantic in their antique architectural set- tings, but came to appear colossal as architectural scale di- minished in medieval and Early Renaissance Rome. Bush ef- fectively describes the sense of fallen glory and of a superhuman golden age that the surviving colossi conveyed symbolically to their Renaissance inheritors, leaving the reader to ponder the implications of a statue's growth in pro- portions measured against a shrunken or changed environ- ment. The interesting questions suggested by Bush's discussion of colossi in general are, unfortunately, poorly served by the chapters on particular works. Tiresome, unenlightening re- hashes of the literature on such warhorses as Michelangelo's Tomb of Julius II or the David contribute little besides bulk to the author's thesis. Throughout the second half of the book, one misses the interpretative links that would connect this catalogue of documented examples with the insights of- fered in the first half. Toward the end of the 16th century, colossal scale was indeed commonplace, and Bush's later chapters resemble all too closely the existing histories of 16th-century sculpture in which inflated scale is simply as- sumed rather than analyzed as an aesthetic and social phe- nomenon. Yet the promise of original thought extended at the begin- ning of this dissertation is fulfilled in the development of an idea that hovers on the periphery until the time is right to make the point: the intimate connection between the colos- sal and the comic, between exaggeration and wit. Early on, Bush tells the story of Michelangelo's joking proposal to Clement VII for a colossus that would double as barbershop and campanile. It was in the nature of colossi, both in an- tiquity and the Renaissance, that the mere envisioning of them was nearly as satisfying as their execution. This is well illustrated by Deinocrates' proposal to Alexander the Great to carve Mt. Athos into a portrait of the king, who would hold in one hand a city of ten thousand inhabitants. The meravig- lioso of the imagination is equally conveyed in Francesco Colonna's description in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili of a bronze colossus 60 paces long, whose interior anatomy could be explored through an entrance in the mouth. Thus the 3 Charles Seymour stimulated inquiry with his Michelangelo's David: A Search for Identity, Pittsburgh, 1967; the significance of the reloca- tion of the David is further examined by Saul Levine, "The Location of Michelangelo's David," Art Bulletin, March, 1974, 31f., and by N. Randolph Parks, "The Placement of Michelangelo's David," Art Bul- letin, December, 1975, 560f.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 489 unrealized joins the unfinished as a positive aesthetic cate- gory, and it is an interesting speculation to what extent the colossal fantasies of Claes Oldenburg (which came to promi- nence while Virginia Bush was writing her dissertation) have sharpened our appreciation of unrealized or lost Renaissance colossi. In the last chapter, Bush draws on modern psychol- ogy to examine the comic effects of abnormal size, and she puts forth a convincing case for the positive values of the grotesque in colossi. She concludes, inevitably, with Giam- bologna's marvelous Apennine as the climax of the cinque- cento colossal tradition, but effectively defines its historical importance as the realization of Deinocrates' and Michelan- gelo's fantasies of a mountain carved into the image of a man. Peter Kinney's Early Sculpture of Bartolommeo Ammanati, a dissertation of 1974 for New York University, contributes modestly to our knowledge of an important 16th-century sculptor. He has gathered more detailed information on Am- manati's early activity, including some new documents, than is presently available in any other single source. Yet as a model of scholarship, this dissertation is as appallingly defi- cient in sound thinking as Schuyler's. Kinney focuses on the first 20 years of Ammanati's sculptural activity, principally spent in Florence, Urbino, and the Veneto, before he moved to Rome in 1548. The better-known monuments of these years, the Sannazzaro Tombs in Naples, the Nari Tomb in Ss. Annunziata, Florence, the Benavides colossal Hercules, are examined in some depth, as are less well-known works such as the reliefs of the Benavides triumphal arch, and the lost fountains executed for Girolamo Gualdo, Ammanati's patron in Vicenza. A secondary concern of the study is the defini- tion of Ammanati's relationship with other 16th-century sculptors, chiefly Bandinelli and Jacopo Sansovino, both for a time his teachers, and Michelangelo, with whom he had indirect but significant contact. The book makes a poor initial impression. No introductory overview is given; instead, after a sketchy biographical first chapter, we are abruptly introduced to Ammanati's sculp- tural style through two highly questionable attributions. The book is also marked by an editorial carelessness that should not have gotten past a thesis advisor. Footnote form is incon- sistent, with op. cit.'s that should be loc. cit.'s; titles are underlined throughout by hand. Figure numbers in the text often do not match those under the illustrations. Frequent minor errors (16th century for 17th century) and misspell- ings abound. There is really no excuse for a specialist in Italian Renaissance sculpture to be unable to spell Pope-Hen- nessy's name correctly. Also distracting is an inconsistency of tone. Kinney ranges from using colloquialisms like "we can't be sure" to old-fashioned English, as in "the design moved the Pope so greatly that. . . ." The latter rendition reveals, beyond an insensitivity to language, an uncritical reading of Vasari, since this interpretation and others like it are accepted at face value. Ammanati's early career is problematic because the touch- stones are too few and too varied to provide a secure stylistic framework. Kinney sensibly accounts for the absence of a clear evolution by suggesting that the artist shifted direction in response to temporarily ascendant influences and to the needs of specific commissions. Yet when defending attribu- tions, he resorts to arguments that presume an internally coherent stylistic development marked by discrete phases. The first work of art discussed is a stone Neptune in the Palazzo Strozzi in Padua, attributed to Ammanati by Fiocco in 1954, an attribution Kinney supports, dating the work before 1533 (predating the earliest certain work by Amman- ati, the Pisa lunette of 1532-34) and claiming the combined influence of Michelangelo and Sansovino. These are logical influences to expect, but no appropriate comparisons are suggested, and I do not know of a single Sansovino sculpture from before 1533 that faintly resembles this figure. Structur- ally, it is closer to later Sansovino, and the figure's vigorous movement, fluid modeling, and inflated musculature might even point to a 17th-century origin. For Kinney, however, the Neptune is stylistically analogous to another attributed work, and their common qualities are used in turn to bolster both attributions. He gives to Ammanati the standing Leda and the Swan in the Victoria and Albert Museum that Keutner has ascribed to Vincenzo Danti.4 Inasmuch as Kinney here concocts an early "warm, sensuous, naturalistic" phase for Ammanati wholly out of new attributions, a phase that is, as far as I can tell, totally undetectable in the Pisa lunette or the Sannazzaro Tomb, it is worth looking at his argument. Stand- ing somewhere between the London Leda and its Hellenistic prototype is a drawing in the Boston Museum that is identi- fied by Kinney as a preparatory sketch for the sculpture (he echoes Pope-Hennessy in making this connection, but does not follow his attribution). Although the drawing bears no resemblance to the known figure drawings by Ammanati,5 it is unhesitatingly claimed by Kinney to be "certainly by Am- manati," because to the author it appears to be a study for the sculpture of Leda. Yet the attribution of the Leda to Am- manati is itself without visible means of support. Kinney is equally unconvincing in his characterization of Ammanati's sculptural style. He finds saturated atmosphere and shimmering optical effects in such works as the Pisa relief and the Justice of the Del Monte Tomb, qualities that to me are impossible to see. In the case of the Justice, there is only a very intellectualized rendering of fluttering drapery, and in the Pisa lunette I wonder if he is not misled by the shadowy atmosphere in front of the darkly recessed relief. The styles of Sansovino, Bandinelli, and Michelangelo are blandly characterized by labels like "classicism" and "ab- straction," and their relationships with each other are greatly oversimplified, even distorted. Kinney makes an especially indefensible case for Ammanati's influence on Sansovino. He correctly observes formal analogies between Ammanati's re- liefs on the Benavides arch and Sansovino's tribune reliefs in S. Marco. But to suggest that Ammanati was the innovator here, whereas Sansovino merely "revealed his solution to the relief problem at an earlier date," is a curious way to dismiss the fact that Sansovino's second set of tribune reliefs was completed three years before the Benavides arch was begun. Credit should be given Kinney, however, for having ex- plored the Sansovino-Ammanati relationship more fully than 4 H. Keutner, "The Palazzo Pitti Venus and Other Works by Vincenzo Danti," Burlington Magazine, c, 1958, 431f. Kinney rejects the attri- bution to Ammanati of the Bargello Leda, based on Michelangelo's Leda cartoon, connecting the London Leda instead with the work described by Borghini. 5 A useful discussion of Ammanati's figure drawings is found in A. M. Gabrielli, "Su Bartolommeo Ammanati," Critica d'arte, ii, 1937, 94, n. 20, and pls. 77-78.</page><page sequence="6">490 THE ART BULLETIN anyone has done so far. The chapter on Ammanati's figures executed for Sansovino's Venetian Library is distinguished by good judgment in the questions he poses about the nature and extent of Ammanati's contribution to the Library, and by a thorough examination of such problems as the division of hands and sequence of execution. Kinney has also pub- lished some 28 documents pertaining to Ammanati's early sculpture, many for the first time. Of particular importance are documents he has found for the Nari Tomb that establish its terminus post quem as October 18, 1539, when Mario Nari was buried after his death in a duel, and that fix the comple- tion date of the tomb as before August 30, 1542. Although many of the sounder ideas advanced by Kinney seem to have come to him from others, especially Kathleen Weil-Garris and Charles Davis, a convincing suggestion of his own is that the colossal Hercules executed for the learned Paduan jurist, Marco Mantova Benavides, allegorically represents Benavides himself. The argument is too heavily dependent on slight facial resemblances, and it could have been effec- tively reinforced by comparison with such clearly analogous work as Bandinelli's and Bronzino's formulations of Andrea Doria as Neptune. Still, the proposal is important. Kinney seems to have had a nodding acquaintance with Bush's dis- sertation, and readers interested in the Benavides Hercules will find a wealth of material in the two dissertations, often presented from points of view that unintentionally conflict, since the later writer did not fully take the earlier author's work into account. In his introduction, Kinney promises that his study of Am- manati's early sculpture will throw light on the artist's career as a whole, yet in the end he draws no significant connec- tions between the early and later work. One wonders whether it was wise to limit the study chronologically and to exclude the four or five major sculptures produced after Kinney's cut- off point. Ammanati's later years were increasingly taken up with architecture, and in the final decade of his life, he re- nounced his earlier sensuous nudes under Counter-Refor- mation influence. Given the difficult and ambiguous charac- ter of Ammanati's total sculptural oeuvre it hardly helps to limit the analysis to a fragment. As Kinney attempts to make sense of the development, he describes Ammanati's career as not progressive and linear (here rejecting Kriegbaum's earlier interpretation), but as "oscillating," depending on the de- gree of stimulus received at any given time from other art- ists. Yet the underlying assumption here is that Ammanati was driven in these diverse directions by "a dedication to formal problems." Why there should be so little stylistic con- sistency, or even coherence, in the work of an artist suppos- edly so inventive and original in his solutions to formal prob- lems is a question lamentably not addressed. Kinney comes closest to a clarification of the artist's intentions when he speaks of Ammanati's "obvious will not to repeat himself," and his "self-consciousness," since it is a self-conscious un- gainliness that seems most to distinguish Ammanati's figure sculptures from the more stylistically suave forms of many of his contemporaries, both painters and sculptors. Kinney does not attempt to define Ammanati's position in relation to maniera, which is a shame, because a reexamination of Am- manati at close range might prove a very effective test of 20th-century interpretations of Mannerism. In his final footnote, Kinney explains that time did not permit a complete documentary, iconographic, and stylistic study of each project, characterizing his own work as a "kind of interim report on work in progress." One hopes that the study is continuing, and that more mature scholarship will result. But given the likelihood that all of these writers will eventually want to put the meat of their dissertations into print, I must return, in closing, to questions properly ad- dressed to the publisher, not the authors. Is such preliminary work worth publishing? In what sense does it deserve to be called outstanding? This is not the place to question present standards of expectation in our best graduate schools, al- though Garland's series may be an unwitting vehicle for such an investigation. Suffice it to say that if the dissertations discussed here genuinely are the cream of the crop, the Cas- sandras who have bewailed the decline of academic stan- dards in contemporary America may well have underesti- mated the problem.
