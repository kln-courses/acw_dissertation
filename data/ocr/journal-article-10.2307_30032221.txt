<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE THEOLOGIAN PHERECYDES OF SYROS AND THE EARLY DAYS OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY HERBERT GRANGER CLASSICAL SCHOLARS WHO TAKE AN INTEREST in the earliest days of natural philosophy should take a closer look at Pherecydes of Syros.' He is more relevant than scholars generally think to the project of patching together a good idea of the intellectual milieu that fostered cosmology and ultimately led to philosophy, as we have come to appreciate it, in the arguments of Parmenides' unnamed goddess. That milieu was primarily theological, and, accordingly, Pherecydes' contribution may be appreciated as more theological than physical. Since nature and divinity are tied together in the tradition of which Hesiod is the primary representative, any re-evaluation of either divinity or nature draws in the other. Pherecydes makes important advances in the Greek conception of the divine nature, and similar insights find their way into the theological side of Anaximander's thought, in which he comes close to formulating in the form of his first principle, the Apeiron, a tran- scendent or supercosmic deity. Once the shared interest in theology of the new intellectuals of the sixth century is recognized, diverse thinkers like Pherecydes, the Orphic poets, the Milesians, Pythagoras, Xenophanes, and Heraclitus may be appreciated as forming a more unified group than is usually acknowledged, through their different efforts to reform or break with the theological tradition embodied in the poetry of Hesiod.2 1 The texts and testimonia are drawn from Diels 1951, Jacoby 1957, Kern 1922, and Schibli 1990. For ease of reading, iota subscripts replace iota adscripts. 2 Burnet 1930:14 has no patience with those who think that the natural philosophers' use of the adjective "divine" has religious significance.

He is the only early theologian whom Aristotle acknowledges by name, when he speaks of those theologians who offer a "mixed" account in their theogonies by not saying everything mythically. These make "the Best" the "first generating agent," in contrast with the other "ancient poets," who begin their theogonies with inferior agents, such as Night, Heaven, Chaos, or Ocean, and then introduce much later the Best when it assumes control over the world-order through a "change" in the divine regime (Metaph. 1091b4-10). Frankel is downright harsh when he says that Pherecydes is "a step backwards" from Hesiod.3 Kirk gives him more credit for advancing thought when he surmises that Pherecydes' three eternal deities provide "a rational amendment of the traditional genealogical pattern," even though Kirk immediately goes on to charge him with falling back into explanations that are "as crudely anthropomorphic as anything in Hesiod.'4 West believes that Pherecydes "deserves better" at the hands of scholars, but in his hands Pherecydes boldly melds together Greek and barbarian ideas in a "crashing syncretism."5 Schibli, who offers the most recent systematic study of Pherecydes, finds that he "foreshadows philosophical concepts,"6 and this approach offers a more fruitful line of interpretation.7 Reliable facts about the life of Pherecydes are not forthcoming, and many of the marvels we find attributed to him are also attributed to Pythagoras (Al), whom the tradition makes his student (Porph. VP 55). theology of the Milesians as so much "lip-service to the gods":' Jaeger 1947 makes a compelling case for the importance of theology in the thought of the earliest physiologoi. 3 Frdnkel 1975:245. 4 Kirk et al. 1983:71. The material on Pherecydes is still largely the work of Kirk from the first edition, and it is referred to in the text as his alone. 5 West 1971:1, 52, 74-75. West does collect an impressive array of facts drawn from oriental sources in his arguments for eastern influences upon Pherecydes and other early Greek intellectuals. 6 Schibli 1990:134, whose book on Pherecydes is invaluable for any study of the subject. 7 Diels and von Fritz offer perhaps the most fantastic interpretation of Pherecydes, in which they make his book out to be an allegory for the cosmology of Anaximander. For the details see Kirk et al. 1983:63-64. Jaeger 1947:70 approves of this interpretation to some degree too when he understands Pherecydes as drawing upon the Milesians. 136</page><page sequence="3">The Theologian Pherecydes of Syros The fifth-century poet, Ion of Chios, provides our earliest surviving comment on Pherecydes. Ion describes him as a man "adorned with manliness and reverence";' who in his death would enjoy a delightful state, "if indeed Pythagoras was truly wise, who knew and learned thoroughly the thoughts of all men" (B4), and many scholars surmise that Ion's encomium of Pherecydes is the slim basis upon which antiq- uity makes him Pythagoras' teacher.8 The testimonia for Pherecydes' doctrines are in many cases brief, late, and provided by question- able witnesses.9 A few important facts remain for us still, above all his authorship of a theo-cosmogony in prose, of which some sixteen lines or so survive. Antiquity credits Pherecydes with publishing the first prose book in Greek literature, and there is no convincing reason to dishonor this widespread tradition by awarding, as some scholars would prefer to do, Anaximander with the credit for the first prose book.'0 Pherecydes provides prima facie a shocking break with his fellow theologians. He shuns verse for prose, and, consonant with his rejection of verse, he calls on no Muse. He proposes before all else a triad of deities, Zas, Chronos, and Chthonil, who have existed "always,"' but who are, despite their unusual names, thinly disguised traditional divinities whose birth Hesiod recounts. Pherecydes assigns widely different roles, from progenitor to creator, for these eternal deities to play in his theo-cosmogony. Like the Orphic poets and Pythagoras, Pherecydes also gives attention to the human soul's circumstances by endowing it with immortality and providing it with the power of metempsychosis. 8 E.g. Kahn 2001:11n20. Schibli 1990:12-13 puts more stress on the common features shared by the psychologies of Pherecydes and Pythagoras as the basis of the legend. 9 Schibli 1990 has collected in his Appendix 2 all the testimonia and all that might count as the fragments of Pherecydes. 10 For example, Jaeger 1947:66-71 credits Anaximander with the first prose book, as does Kahn 1960:240. Those who argue for Anaximander's priority presume that Pherecydes' doctrine depends upon his, but this presumption begs the question, since the similarities between the two authors could be due to the influence of Pherecydes upon Anaximander, or the influence of a common agent upon the both of them. Kahn 2003:142 is willing to concede that Pherecydes may have written the first prose literary book, because, Kahn argues, Anaximander's book is more likely in the genre of technical treatises. Schibli 1990:4 rightly points out that there is no good reason to overturn the judgment of the doxographical tradition. 137</page><page sequence="4">Herbert Granger Porphyry tells us that Pherecydes' cosmos is shaped to accommodate the soul's comings and goings with "nooks and holes and caves and doors and gates" through which souls pass in their "births and deaths" (Antr. 31 [B6]). The theo-cosmogony of Pherecydes makes it evident that the earliest "natural philosophers," the Milesian physiologoi, do not stand alone in their reaction to the tradition as we find it in Hesiod's Theogony. The Orphic authors are also an important part of this reac- tion. The discovery of the Derveni papyrus scroll allows us to assign with more confidence an earlier date for the first of the Orphic poems than scholars have hitherto generally conceded and to place these poems closer to the time of Pherecydes.11 Orphic verse and Pherecydes' prose arise in a period when the authority of the tradition is weak- ening. Hesiod back in the eighth or seventh century writes confidently under his own name but under the auspices of the Muses. The Orphic authors do not write under their own names,12 but, instead, credit their work to the legendary "Orpheus," the greatest singer of myth, who has visited the underworld, and who claims for his heritage, on Plato's report, "the Moon and the Muses" (R. 2.364e). The impeccable credentials of Orpheus fully qualify him to sing authoritatively about the gods and the fate of the human soul. Pherecydes can claim nothing of the sort for himself, and, since he eschews verse for prose, he is in 11 The papyrus scroll was discovered in 1962; its surviving text is a commentary by an unknown author upon an Orphic theogony, and it quotes some nineteen verses of the poem. The date of the commentary is put at around the last quarter of the fifth century, and Parker 1995:484 suggests that the earliest Orphic poems may now be placed in the second half of the sixth century. Schibli 1990:35 is more generous and supposes that the "main doctrines" of Orphism may belong to "the time in which Pherekydes was composing his book:' See West 1983:75-101 for details on the papyrus and its text. There is a helpful collection of essays on the papyrus (Laks and Most 1997), and Janko 2001 provides a recent significant supplement. 12 Parker 1995:484 gives as the reason for the turn to pseudonymity that the point had been reached in Greek history in which "no living mortal could claim privileged insight into the workings of the divine." Parker's explanation must find an exception in Pherecydes, if the earliest of the Orphic poets are close to his time. Epimenides of Crete is credited with a theogony, which he might have actually written, and Acusilaus of Argos begins his Genealogiai with a theogony. See West 1966:12-13 for a brief review of the liter- ature on the birth of the gods. 138</page><page sequence="5">The Theologian Pherecydes ofSyros no position to call upon any divine authority to aid him. He writes in his own name, thereby putting himself on a par with and challenging Hesiod, but without the backing of tradition. Accordingly, he stands out sharply from Hesiod, as well as from the Orphic poets with whom, despite their similarities,13 he should not be confounded. They are secretive (F334 Kern) and pseudonymous, and Pherecydes is not. His stories of the gods are too tame for the tastes of the Orphic authors to count as one of them, who, as Isocrates says of Orpheus, "told stories about the gods such as no one would dare to tell about their enemies ... eating of children and castrating of fathers and fettering of mothers" (Busiris 38). Instead, Pherecydes is interested in purging divinity of the disgraceful behavior Hesiod recounts about the gods and in providing the gods with more respectable reputations. If Aristophanes' portrait of Strepsiades can be trusted as a light thrown upon the vulgar imagina- tion of the fifth century, then the divinities of the traditional stories were subjected to even more demeaning depictions than those we find in Homer and Hesiod, when Strepsiades confesses his belief that rain is just "Zeus pissing through a sieve" (Nu. 373). There is a broad discontent with the tradition, which draws together Pherecydes, the Milesians, and the Orphic authors, and what they all clearly have in common is a concern for the correct depiction of the divine nature. However, there are really two re-evaluations of divinity, and, though they share a departure from Hesiod, they remain far apart and move in opposite directions: in the one case there is an interest in assigning more dignity, a more stately position for divinity in the cosmos or beyond; in the other there is an interest in promoting and exploiting scandalous stories about divinity. There is yet another asym- metry we may detect among the parties in revolt against Hesiod, which puts Pherecydes on the side of the Orphic authors and of Pythagoras. These thinkers share a common desire to improve humankind's expec- tation for the afterlife, whereas this concern does not stir the physi- ologoi at all. 13 Among the similarities between Pherecydes and the Orphic poets, Parker 1995:501 stresses their common adherence to metempsychosis, their mythological style of expres- sion, and their use of Chronos as a god and of demiurgic deities. 139</page><page sequence="6">Herbert Granger Another important dimension in the reaction against Hesiod shows itself in slightly later thinkers like Hecataeus of Miletus, a contempo- rary of Anaximenes, who is sometimes grouped with Pherecydes as another early author of prose (Ti Jacoby [Str. 1.2.6]). Hecataeus was dissatisfied with the stories of the heroes as he found them in Hesiod and the poetic tradition in general, and he set about to purge them of their irrationalities. His prose mythography is an inquiry into the gene- alogies of the descendants of Heracles and Deucalion and of other fami- lies, including his own, who claim a divine heritage, and in some of the testimonia his book goes under the title Historiai. He opens it with this remarkable assertion of his epistemic autonomy: "Hecataeus of Miletus says this: These things I write, as it seems to me to be true; for the stories of the Greeks are many and ridiculous, as it appears to me" (F1 Jacoby). Hecataeus declares his own responsibility for the opinions in his book, as what he takes to be the probable truth of the matter, and he finds the "stories" of the Greeks false because in the multitude of their renditions of the same topic they are incompatible (e.g. h. Dionysus 1.1- 6) and because they are incoherent in their own right (e.g. the number of Aegyptus' sons on Hesiod's report, F19 Jacoby).14 In the light of these considerations it is evident that the Milesian physiologoi make up just one party in a broad reaction against the religious tradition. The authors who revolt against tradition give a prominent place to theogony or cosmogony, because their reassessment of divinity must begin with the nature of the gods, and, according to the tradi- tional pattern Hesiod follows and strongly reaffirms, the essence of the gods is centered in their birth and heritage and their positions in the world-order.15 There is no complete agreement over the broad features and details of Pherecydes' theo-cosmogony, but from the 14 Hecataeus, however, reports many outrageous stories, of which a couple of out- standing examples are a talking ram (F17 Jacoby) and the Ethiopian tribe of the EKtl1Tro5q, who protect themselves from the sun by lying upon their backs and raising their feet above them for shade (F327 Jacoby). "5 we find the same stress on birth and position in the description of the theogony Hermes sings to Apollo, in what is probably among the earliest of our records of Greek theogonies (h. Hermes 4.427-433). Plato has Adeimantus say that we know of the gods from the poets who describe their pedigree (R. 365el-3). 140</page><page sequence="7">The Theologian Pherecydes of Syros sifting of its few fragments and testimonia an outline of his narra- tive might look something like this. From eternity there are three gods, Zas, Chronos, and Chthonia, whom Pherecydes introduces in the opening sentence of his book: Z&amp;d p-v Kai Xp6voq I oav &amp;Ei Kai XOoviri (B1).16 Pherecydes' construction of this sentence suggests that the male gods Zas and Chronos form a pair distinct from the goddess Chthonit, as if she were set apart from them as not fully their equal, and her inferior position in the opening sentence could prefigure her inferior status in the cosmogony, in which her role is merely one of female passivity. The summary in Damascius' testimonium suggests that soon after Pherecydes introduces his eternal trinity he recounts how Chronos "made from his own seed fire and pneuma and water";' and that these substances were deposited "in five nooks,"' from which "arose another plentiful generation of gods" (Pr. 124b [A8]). A fragment from Pherecydes' book records how unknown agents prepare for Zas' wedding with Chthonil: for him they make dwellings many and great. When they have finished all these things and furniture and man- servants and maid-servants and the others as many as all the things needed, when everything is prepared, they have the wedding. B2 col. 1 On the third day of the wedding, Zas weaves a "robe" (wptpoq), "large and beautiful," upon which he "embroiders Earth and OgZnos and the halls of Oglnos," and he gives this robe as his wedding gift to Chthoniz (B2 col. 1). As we learn from the other half of the opening sentence of Pherecydes' book, Chthonit's name, upon receiving the gift of the robe, becomes GC, the traditional name of Earth, X0ovin 5E vopa y7vVso rfi iEtSil abntf Z&amp;q yfiv yfpaq 5601i (B1). Presumably when Chthonit dons the robe, the earth of our familiar cosmos comes into existence. Pherecydes pauses in his narrative and explains that this third day of 16 Diogenes Laertius tells us that this is the sentence that begins Pherecydes' treatise (1.119). As West 1971:9 points out, this report may still be correct even if the book actu- ally began with the sort of sphragis we find in use since the time of Hecataeus, because the sentence Diogenes quotes would be the actual commencement of Pherecydes' narrative. 141</page><page sequence="8">Herbert Granger the marriage of Zas and ChthoniZ provides the first anakalyptiria, the unveiling of the bride, and thereby establishes "the custom among gods and men."17 On the report of Proclus, when Zas is about to take up his creative activity, pEXXovvra 6tpioupy'iv, he becomes the god Eros (in Ti. 32c [B3], cf. All), and Chthonii takes on a similarity with Hera when Zas entrusts her at their marriage with the responsibility for all marriages (B2 col. 2).18 If Zas in his demiurgy becomes Eros, Pherecydes may intend an allegory, in which Zas is the power of attraction that brings about the "mixture" of diverse materials.19 Chronos, however, may provide prima facie a better candidate for such a force, since from his seed he provides the material from which the next generation of gods emerge.20 Chthoniý as Gý may also be thought to take on a somewhat erotic func- tion in Pherecydes' theo-cosmogony in her capacity as the mistress of marriages. In the testimonium of Clement the "embroidered robe" hangs upon a "winged oak" (B2),21 which arguably is Chthonil as the substructure of the visible earth.22 Hesiod sings of the "roots of Earth 17 The wedding ceremonies took place over three days, of which the last was devoted to the unveiling, gifts, and consummation (Hsch. s.v. avcrXKaunltrptov). A matrimonial gift of a peplos is perhaps far from uncommon. Telemachus receives a peplos from Helen, which she had woven, and she instructs him to give it to his bride on their wedding day (od. 15.123-128). Cadmus gives Harmonia a peplos on their marriage, which he too does not weave (Apollod. 3.4.2). Zas may be unique among bridegrooms in Greek archaic litera- ture for weaving and embroidering his wedding present for his bride himself. 18 West 1971:19-20 argues for another reading of the opening of B2 col. 2, y&amp;p o-o roib ypouq Eva -COo6-c oGE ctpL, in which he also rejects the usual assumption that the presumed lost participle that would open the sentence is something like 3ouv6oPEvoq. Since West contends that marriages are not the patronage of Gý, he recommends for the missing participle something to the effect "to make it known" and for the transla- tion, "that it is your wedding, etc.,' instead of "since I wish marriages to be yours, etc":' See Schibli 1990:62-63 with n29 for the reading that Zas makes Chthonie responsible for marriages. 19 West 1971:17 argues that Proclus misidentified Zas' sexual ardor for his transforma- tion into Eros, and that Pherecydes intended no such metamorphosis. 20 Schibli 1990:20n15 suggests that Chronos is responsible for the mixture of the elements that gives rise to the second generation of gods. 21 West 1971:59 admits that the conceit of the winged tree is "unique" to Pherecydes; presumably the chthonic tree is winged so that it may stay aloft without any underpin- ning support. 22 West 1971:20, 59 prefers to see the tree as taking the place of Chthonil rather than her being the tree. Kirk et al. 1983:65 try to make out that there is no connection whatso- 142</page><page sequence="9">The Theologian Pherecydes ofSyros and the barren Sea," which growjust above Tartarus (Th. 727-728), and "roots" need not be merely a dead metaphor for him.23 Statues of the gods were often carved from tree trunks, and on special occasions some were adorned with clothing. These rituals may have something to do with Pherecydes' strange depiction of Chthonie as a winged oak tree,24 and the holiness of the oak tree to Zeus would at least explain why the tree is an oak (Od. 14.328). Yet the conceit that the earth is a rooted tree whose branches reach up into the heavens, though unprecedented among the Greeks, is perhaps not so fanciful for the poetic imagination, even continuing to have its attraction among poets, as in James Joyce's Ulysses, "The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit."25 Other testimonia relate how Chronos, under the traditional name of Kronos, is challenged for the dominion of heaven by "Ophioneus" (B4- 5, All), a creature of unknown lineage, whose name suggests a "snake;' 6qptq, of some monstrous sort (Origenes Cels. 6.43). According to the terms of their contest the one who falls into Oganos, which is Ocean, is the vanquished; Ophioneus and his army of Ophionidai suffer this defeat, and Kronos is crowned upon his victory (Tertullian De corona militis 7.4 [B4]). Afterwards, there may be a division of portions among the gods, of the sort we find in Homer and Hesiod (Hom. II. 15.189-193, Hes. Th. 73-74, 881-885), since fragment B5 refers to "the Tartarian portion," i rapTapirl polopa,26 which is located beneath an unnamed "portion." The "daughters of Boreas, the Harpies and Thuella, guard" this "Tartarian portion," and it is the place where "Zeus," who presum- ably is Zas under this traditional name, banishes those gods who behave "with insolence:" Chronos-Kronos appears to be eclipsed in importance ever between Chthonii and the tree. Schibli 1990:75 holds that the tree and Chthonii may be equated only "partially" because earth forms only a part of the tree. Jaeger 1947:69-70 appreciates that the winged tree and Chthonii are the same. 23 The opinion of West 1971:58. 24 See West 1971:72-74 on ceremonies involving trees.

A variety of cosmic trees can be found among the ancient beliefs of different peoples distant from one another; see West 1971:55-60 and Schibli 1990:71-72. 26 This unusual adjective rap-rapirl testifies further to Pherecydes' linguistic inventive- ness. Lilja 1968:30 finds "T raprtapirl o~lpa to be a "solemn phrase" in contrast with the "simple Tdprapo'," and she points out its appearance in Orphic verse (Orph. H. 18). 143</page><page sequence="10">Herbert Granger by Zas-Zeus, since it is the latter who takes on the power to banish. Consequently, the secure ascendancy Zeus assumes in the Theogony of Hesiod may devolve upon Zas-Zeus in Pherecydes' story. First, a comment is required upon the names. Some changes are transparent, and they draw upon the ancient belief that the etymology of a name reveals the true nature of the object bearing that name (e.g. Hes. Th. 209).27 Chronos as a play on Kronos is a temptation easy to appreciate, and centuries later Plutarch comments on the Greek predi- lection for this alteration (Is. et Os. 363d). But it is far from obvious just what use Pherecydes makes of his belief that the true name of Kronos is "Time." Probus surmises that "time is that in which the whole region is governed," tempus in quo universa pars moderetur (In Vergilii Bucolica 6.31). There is no trace of Chronos as a kind of "envelope" in what we know about Pherecydes' book, although Probus might simply mean that Chronos functions as some sort of principle of order.28 Zeller and Wilamowitz recognize only the spelling Kp6voC, since they take the abstract concept of time to be too sophisticated for a sixth-century author.29 Yet Solon, who lived in the second half of the seventh century and into the sixth, personifies time when he writes 'v &amp;iKl Xp6vou (F36.3 West). At some point the Orphic authors connected Kronos with Time (F68 Kern), who plays a founding role in their theo-cosmogo- nies.30 Time begets great physical masses of the cosmos (F66 Kern); then he fashions from aither a "silvery egg,"' from which hatches the god Phanes (F70 Kern), who engenders or creates all else (e.g. F109, F88 27 For the significance of etymology, see Jaeger 1947:68-69 with n64. 28 Schibli 1990:30 argues for a parallel between Anaximander's and Pherecydes' use of Chronos as an "ordering principle." Schibli bases his case for the parallel on Pherecydes' use of Chronos as the agent who orders spatially the material of his production. Yet Chronos in the fragment of Anaximander has a temporal dimension, just as one would expect, when it measures the periods of domination and subjection between the oppo- sites. Both Schibli 1990:37 and West 1971:28-36 point out the divinity of "Time" in ancient non-Greek literature and how this literature may be ultimately the ground for Pherecydes' conception of Chronos, as an eternal autosexually generating deity. 29 As West 1971:10 and Schibli 1990:17n9 report. 30 The activity of Chronos we find in the much-later Rhapsodic Theogony, but West 1983:87 presumes the same role for Chronos in the poem of the Derveni papyrus because of its other similarities with the Rhapsody. Damascius says of the Rhapsody that it is "the usual Orphic theology" (F60 Kern). 144</page><page sequence="11">The Theologian Pherecydes ofSyros Kern).31 Time also has a prominent position in the cosmology of Anaximander, although there is no compelling reason to think he personifies time, and the role he gives time in the few remaining words of his book are perfectly intelligible. Opposing forces, hot, cold, dry, moist, light, dark, cannot completely dominate their opposite, and the opposites must "pay penalty and retribution to each other for their injustice according to the ordinance of time" (Bl). There is a mutual exchange of wrong and retribution between the opposites, and an equilibrium holds between them over the long haul. Time merely measures the periods of domination and subjugation. We should expect Pherecydes' Chronos to be some kind of "judge," as Time is in Solon's fragment, but nothing as simple as Solon's depiction or Anaximander's use of time as a measure for temporal periods can be discerned in Pherecydes' fragments. The name of Chthonii is much easier; x06vtio means "in," "under" or "beneath the earth" (Hes. Th. 767), and Pherecydes uses it for the original name of GE to prefigure her role as Earth and also to indicate her true nature as the underlying foundation of our visible world.32 Since OgCnos as the true name of Ocean has no obvious etymological basis in Greek, West speculates that Pherecydes draws upon Aramaic words for "basin" or "rim."33 The name of Zas troubles scholars the most. Gomperz, whomJaeger follows, argues for its derivation from Fifv, which would reflect the life-giving power of the deity.34 Kirk, however, suggests that the name Zdq is based on 4a-, an intensive prefix,35 as in such words as 608Eoq and carqi, "very divine" and "strong-blowing,"' in which the prefix heightens the force of the noun or adjective. West 31 Phanes, in turn, is swallowed by Zeus (F58 Kern), along with everything else, and then Zeus recreates from what he has consumed the gods and the cosmos so that he may take credit for the current state of the universe (F168 Kern). See West 1983:70-75 for a most helpful summary of the Rhapsodic Theogony with abundant references to the fragments. 32 A fragment of unknown date attributed to the legendary Musaeus, a disciple of Orpheus, names a goddess Chthonir who gives oracles at Delphi, and presumably is iden- tified with the goddess GF, the first presiding deity at Delphi (B11). 33 West 1971:50 refers to his suggestion as "the least implausible etymology," but what is more implausible is Pherecydes' drawing upon his knowledge of Aramaic vocabulary. 34 Gomperz 1905:86; Jaeger 1947:68. 35 Kirk et al. 1983:57. 145</page><page sequence="12">Herbert Granger dismisses these suggestions in favor of his syncretic interpretation, in which he leans on the stem Zant-, rather than the nominative Zas, so that he may argue for the name of a barbarian god from southern Asia Minor, Santa, whom the Hittites identified with their Weather-god, as Pherecydes' model.36 The (a- intensive prefix, however, provides a much more attractive proposal. The simple addition of sigma makes for a short nominative of a single syllable that sounds much like "Zeus." Since to the Greek ear the word could also suggest its intensive connotation along with its sound close to that of "Zeus," the name may be intended to mark the asymmetry between the gods of Pherecydes' trinity. Zas is the superior of both Chronos and ChthoniE, as the god who, like Zeus, has the most exalted divinity among all the gods. Despite Pherecydes' apparent pairing of Zas and Chronos in the opening sentence of his theo-cosmogony, he names Zas first and places his name at the head of the sentence. At the (apparent) close of Pherecydes' story, Zas' hege- mony is evidently confirmed by his control over his enemies, without any mention of aid from Chronos-Kronos. Pherecydes must believe that his unusual names for the gods are the traditional gods' true names by which they address one another,37 and which indicate more clearly their true nature. The commonplace names of the gods, which Homer and Hesiod adopt, Pherecydes must believe distort the true nature of the gods, and in some cases he may even believe they are corruptions of the true names. At some point in his story, as several testimonia indicate, he allows the gods to assume these vulgar names, as he explicitly does so when he explains how Chthoniý came to be named Ge (Bl). The significance of this return to the vulgar names in his story is debated, since it is possible, although improbable, that they emerged as flaws in the transmission of the text: a scribal error, for instance, could easily account for a change from Xp6voR to Kp6voy.38 Furthermore, Pherecydes may use these strange divine names as a provocation, as a way of sharpening his disagreement with the tradition.

Of his deity, "one the wise alone," he says that it "is not willing and willing to be called by the name of Zeus" (B32). Pherecydes may allow Zas to become Eros, and Heraclitus is willing for his own ends to draw together traditionally different gods when he says that "Hades and Dionysus are the same" (B15). The identification of different gods is also a feature of the Orphic poems, in which, for example, Zeus' mother Rhea becomes Demeter (F145 Kern), and Zeus himself is identified with Metis and Eros (F168.9 Kern). Pherecydes' etymological play extends beyond the names of the gods of the eternal trinity. A testimonium indicates that he referred to the goddess Rhea, 'P~a, as 'PWi, which Kirk, who may be influenced by Socrates' playfulness in the Cratylus at 402a, links with Eiv, "to flow."39 Achilles Tatius alleges that Pherecydes derives X6oq from X~c0at, "to pour," so that he may connect Chaos with water (Isagoges excerpta 3 [Bla])." Pherecydes even exercises his etymological skills upon the names of inanimate objects, arriving at the gods' true name for "dining- table," rpdmt ca, as "watcher over offerings,' 0vop6q (B12). Apparently, Pherecydes practices the etymological art beyond anything we find in Hesiod. This is not, however, mere intellectual naivete, but a symptom of the early effort to break from dependence upon the Muses, and in their place to call upon mere human analytical skills to arrive at knowl- edge beyond the scope of human observation and history. We find in Heraclitus the same presumption about the truth-yielding capacities of linguistic analysis, when he puns skillfully upon BIOE by shifting the accent, so that the meaning may pass from "bow" to "life:' This simple linguistic fact he uses to support his thesis of the unity of opposites: the bow that yields death is named "life" (B48). Yet Pherecydes' rationalism is still more striking in his introduc- tion of eternal deities, who are in different ways responsible for, and underpin, the rest of reality. By providing an eternal basis for reality and 39 Kirk et al. 1983:57; see West 1971:18n3 and Schibli 1990:17n8 for the suggestion that 'Pfi may not even be unusual, and may simply be the result of a normal dialectal develop- ment in Ionic. 40 West 1971:11-12 finds it highly improbable that Pherecydes advocated any etymology for Xado of the sort Achilles Tatius ascribes to him. 147</page><page sequence="14">Herbert Granger the cosmos, he avoids the embarrassment Hesiod faces, which any child might have brought to his story-telling parent's attention by asking, "But what was there before Chaos came to be?" Pherecydes has no argument for his eternal trinity, but his story offers a strong challenge to Hesiod by offering a more explanatorily satisfying narrative of the world-order's coming-to-be. In his lack of argumentation Pherecydes is on a par with the Milesian physiologoi, whose treatises, if we were to possess them, we would probably find contain no arguments on a grand scale, no more than what we find in Anaxagoras (B12), or in Heraclitus (B88), or for that matter in what is reported about Anaximander. According to Aristotle, Anaximander argues for the stability of the earth, along lines that suggest the assumption of the principle of suffi- cient reason (Cael. 295b11-16 [A26]). The physiologoi would employ arguments only to advance a particular facet of their overall posi- tion, and their speculation as a whole has its appeal in its reliance on what would seem to be most likely, like the reasoning of Hecataeus of Miletus, who declares that he relates the past "as it seems to me to be true" (F1 Jacoby), in his own efforts to retrieve the truth hidden under the mythological dross of the poets. The views of the physiologoi are more convincing than those of their competitors, not because of exten- sive argumentation, but because their narratives of events cohere more satisfactorily, are simpler, less arbitrary, and more adequately address gaps in previous expositions.41 Extensive argumentation comes with Parmenides, as the gift of the goddess, and is the purview of pure philosophy rather than natural philosophy. Hesiod would defend himself perhaps by responding that the child asks for what cannot be known, even by the Muses. Xaoq, who is born "first of all," comes into existence, unlike any of the other gods, without any epithet, and its exact position in the world-order is even doubtful. Scholars depend to a large extent on etymology for their conjecture that "chaos" signi- fies some sort of "gap" or "chasm" within the world-order (Th. 700).42 41 Schofield 1980:25 offers suggestions along these lines, "standards of generality, non-arbitrariness, economy and explanatory power," for the philosophical dimension in Milesian speculation, and he also presumes that the physiologoi neglect argumentation. 42 E.g. Xdoq may be connected with XadKEtv ("gape"): Jaeger 1947:13; Cornford 1952:194-195 and 194n1; Kirk et al. 1983:37-38. 148</page><page sequence="15">The Theologian Pherecydes ofSyros Much later in his poem, when Hesiod designates the distant abode of the defeated Titans, he locates them "across dark Chaos'" ttprqv X&amp;EOC 4oqpEpoio (814), and Chaos is the first of the gods to produce offspring, male and female twin versions of darkness, "Erebus and black Night" (123).43 In the mythopoeic imagination, the dark nature of Chaos and its spawning of other forms of darkness reflect the emergence of Chaos from the unknown shrouded in darkness. Despite Pherecydes' myste- rious names for the gods, his story leaves no room for the profound mystery we find in Hesiod, and even in Anaximander. Pherecydes' outstanding difference from Hesiod and the traditional mythology of the gods lies in his undertaking to gain for the gods a dignity suitable to the moral propriety the Greeks had come to expect of one another. Pherecydes gives us a glimpse into the early stages of the moral reassessment of divinity, which we find at a much more advanced stage in Xenophanes. But this reassessment marks also the theological speculation of the Milesians, who traffic in nothing like the stories of Hesiod and Homer, who, Xenophanes complains, ascribe to the gods behavior unworthy of even mere mortals (B11). Possibly Pherecydes is the first to offer a tamer set of gods, who do not practice "theft, adul- tery, and mutual deceit," the moral failings Xenophanes highlights as the iniquities that Homer and Hesiod attribute to the gods. The best of Pherecydes' gods exist before all else, as Aristotle points out, and, since Aristotle contrasts Pherecydes with poets who tell stories of succession, there are probably no violent successions among Pherecydes' gods," of the sort we find in Hesiod's Theogony or in Orphic verse (e.g. F154 Kern). Nor do the gods of Pherecydes devour one another so that they may avert some foreseen threat to their rule or to absorb the dangerous power of the consumed god, as the gods do in gruesome stories we find in Hesiod (e.g. Th. 886-900) and the Orphic poets (e.g. F58, F167 Kern). The violence the gods of Pherecydes face comes only in addressing a threat 43 Even though "Erebus" is neuter, the god plays a masculine role as the consort of feminine Night. 44 The Suda reports that Pherecydes' "theology" comprised "the birth and successions of gods" (A2), and Kirk et al. 1983:70 propose a violent succession from Kronos to Zeus. Schibli 1990:14 proposes nothing of the sort, and there is no reason to assume any violent succession except by imposing too close a parallel with Hesiod. 149</page><page sequence="16">Herbert Granger from a force external to their circle and from a creature of unknown birth. Ophioneus, the snake-like contender for the domain of heaven, is most likely modeled on Hesiod's monster Typhoeus, and Ophioneus' contest with Chronos-Kronos is plausibly Pherecydes' effort to combine features of Hesiod's stories of the battle between the Olympians and the Titans and Zeus' combat with Typhoeus.45 Perhaps, as in the case of Hesiod's stories of the threats to the Olympians, Pherecydes' narra- tive of the battle between the armies of Chronos-Kronos and Ophioneus provides the guarantee that the Best is secure against any threats and that the world-order is stable under its benign rule. In addition, there is even a homely dimension to Pherecydes' depiction of the gods, in the careful attention he gives to the marriage of Zas and chthonia and in the stress he puts upon its aetiological significance for mankind's marriage practices.46 The royal marriage probably played a big role in Pherecydes' narrative, since the bestowal of the wedding gift is at the center of his cosmogony. The importance of the marriage is also indi- cated when it is alluded to in the opening sentence of the book, in its reference to the wedding "gift" Zas confers upon Chthonii, which brings about her change in name and in status. Pherecydes' story of theo-cosmogony is especially important because there is nothing like it in Greek literature until the poems of the Orphic poets, who very likely draw upon his book, as they clearly draw upon Hesiod's.47 Before the backdrop of an eternal divine trinity, there are two clearly marked stages in the coming-to-be of the world- order. The first stage is theogonic, and the material that makes up these generated gods is the physical material of "fire and air [breath] and water," nuOp Kcai nvEOpa Kai i56op48; these Chronos "made from his own seed," ' noifc atK To0 y6voU UavTo0, and they find their way "into 45 West 1971:49 believes otherwise, and contends that the story of Ophioneus is too unusual to be Greek in origin and must come from an eastern source.

And the cosmos too would have a share in these materials in its own compo- sition. The location of the "nooks" is unspecified; "nooks" as the recep- tacles of the material Chronos discharges conjures up "mixing bowls" or "mortars,' and one of the titles of Pherecydes' book preserved in the Suda provides some evidence for the nooks as mortars, 'ETtaPuXo OEoKpaloa, Seven-Nook Mixing of the Gods.49 Chronos, however, is not depicted as an alchemist, and this role might seem to belong more appropriately to Zas, if in his demiurgy he takes on the nature of Eros (B3). The best candidate for the home of the "nooks" is ChthoniR,so who as earthy stuff contributes the remaining traditional basic physical material, and as a great oak tree readily furnishes nooks and hollows. Besides, the female body famously calls up images of hollows, valleys, and caves. We find a precedent in Hesiod for a "nook of the Earth" as the birthplace of a god, Tartarus, who comes to be "in a nook of the broad-pathed Earth,'" puxi X0ovbq EUpuoosirq (Th. 119). The biological model of coming-to-be is grounded in the age-old tradition Hesiod represents, although Pherecydes' use of it might seem to be innovative, in that he specifies the three materials discharged by Chronos, from which, nestled in nooks, finite gods emerge. There is, however, a distant parallel in Hesiod in that the Furies and the Giants spring up like plants from the Earth, soaked with the blood from the severed genitals of Heaven, as Kronos flings them into the sea, and Aphrodite is, in turn, born from the bloody foam churned up around these genitals as they are swept along in the open sea (Th. 182-192). The role of these gener- ated gods in the world-order is far from evident, although Ophioneus and his army of Ophionidai perhaps are to be counted among them. The second stage is particularly noteworthy because it has a demi- urgic dimension. It should be considered largely cosmogonic, even 49 Damascius reports "five nooks:' whereas the Suda records "seven nooks." West 1971:8, 13 contends that the "seven nooks" recorded by the Suda is a mistake, and he recommends emending the latter. Kirk et al. 1983:51, 58-59 prefer seven over five. For the problem over the number of "nooks" and an effort to explain the disagreement between the two testimonia as a confusion between poilpat and puxoi, see Schibli 1990:46-49. 50 Kirk et al. 1983:59 conjecture the same, and so too Schibli 1990:22. 151</page><page sequence="18">Herbert Granger though some divinities may also be created as cosmic deities of the sort we find in Hesiod. This stage involves the craftsmanship of Zas, who first "makes a robe" and then "embroiders" upon it the earth. This robe presumably depicts like a map the features of the earth's surface, including Ogenos, who is the Ocean surrounding the earth in Hesiod and Homer. Since Ocean is a Titan, presumably OgEnos is a god too, and thus Zas fashions a cosmic god as a part of the robe, along with the features of earth that Chthonix embodies when she puts on the robe and becomes the traditional earth goddess, G.. Accordingly, the demiurgic side of Pherecydes' thought is augmented by his enlisting a living deity to be literally the foundation of his creation. Yet before Pherecydes' tale, no god had been depicted as a creator-god in Greek literature.51 Lloyd thinks that we should find it no surprise that Homer's supreme god is "no craftsman-creator," since craftsmen were held in low esteem, and Lloyd points out that Zeus does not take upon himself the task, but orders the craftsman-god Hephaestus to make Pandora, the first female human (Hes. Th. 571-572, Op. 60-63).52 Pherecydes is all the more daring, even provoking, in his vivid portrait of his supreme god Zas as a creator-god, because he does not simply depict him as a creator in an abstract fashion, as the ancient Hebrews appear to portray their creator-god in the opening of Genesis, when they depict him as bringing the world into existence through his word alone." Instead, Pherecydes makes his creator-god a craftsman who weaves and embroiders, who makes use of feminine crafts, the very ones Athena teaches the newly 51 Demiurgic deities are abundant in non-Greek ancient literatures; see e.g. Wilson 1949. Also of interest is West 1971:54-55 who provides evidence of "cosmic weaving" beyond the Greek world. West believes it probable that Pherecydes' idea of the robe has an oriental provenance, although he supposes that Zas' weaving the robe for Chthonie is "a spontaneous invention of Pherecydes." See Scheid and Svenbro 1996 for the signifi- cance of weaving among the ancient Greeks and Latins for their understanding of poli- tics, marriage, and poetry. 52 Lloyd 1966:208-209. Lloyd 1966:292n1 finds an indication of the contempt for arti- sans in archaic times in Aristotle's report that "in ancient times" T6 pdvauoov, "the mechanical class,' were often slaves and foreigners, which he still finds to be much the case in his own day (Pol. 1278a6-8, cf. 1277b1-3). 53 Yet in the second chapter of Genesis the Hebrew god creates humankind and animals in a more concrete fashion by fashioning man from the dust of the earth (2.7), beasts and birds from the ground (2.19), and woman from the rib of man (2.22). 152</page><page sequence="19">The Theologian Pherecydes of Syros created Pandora (Hes. Op. 63-64).54 Even if Pherecydes is influenced by foreign ideas, he is no less daring or original for introducing the idea of a craftsman-god among the Greeks. Zas' feminine craftsmanship, as well as his prominent association with love and marriage,55 argue for his possession of a peace-loving character, which would be a further marked departure of Pherecydes' theology from the religious tradition of the Greeks, who require the most important of their earliest male deities to be warriors. Zas' peaceful nature would explain his, otherwise puzzling, absence from the battle against Ophioneus, where the fighting is left to Chronos-Kronos and his army. Pherecydes' evident abhorrence of bloodshed, as the testimonium of Themistius (Or. 2.38a-b) would indicate, provides reason enough for his endowing his supreme deity with pacific virtues. The earliest of the physiologoi do not shape their divinity into any kind of creator. Before Anaxagoras (B12) and his likely student Diogenes of Apollonia (B5), we do not find anything like a god who could be said to create in some fashion the cosmos,56 unless it be the goddess of Parmenides' fictional cosmology of mortals, "who pilots all things / For she rules over hateful birth and mixture of all things" (B12.3-4), 5 Od. 20.72 provides another example of Athena's teaching young women Epya ... KUTa pydVEo0at. Hesiod designates the twelfth day of the month to be best for "a woman" to set up her loom and get on with her work (Op. 779). Herodotus, when he details examples of how the Egyptians differ in everything from the rest of humanity, writes that the women practice trade while the men stay at home and weave (2.35, cf. Soph. OC 337-341). Men who weave are not, however, completely unheard of among the Greeks in archaic times. Scheid and Svenbro 1996:23, 18-19 point out that King Arcas of Arcadia, whom Adristas taught "spinning," was the first to teach his people how to "weave a garment" (Paus. 8.4.1), and that two men were the first to weave the trtntXo to be placed upon the statue of Athena Polias during the Great Panathenaea, although for subsequent investitures of the statue, the task of weaving was taken up by two Athenian maidens (Zen. 1.56). Much later Plato will have occasion to mention male weavers now and again (e.g. Phd. 87b). 55 The testimonium of Maximus Tyrius features the love-match between Zas and Chthonia, when he remarks on "the love between them," :6v v ourotoC "Epwcoa (Philo- sophumena 4.4.5-8 [All]). 56 There is also the comment of Xenophanes, Ei pl Xwph opv qpuoE OE; e~ tp (B38), "if god had not begot yellow honey," which tempts one to think that his supreme god has a demiurgic mission. Guthrie 1962:376 holds, however, that these words are nothing more than a "conventional phrase" that means "if honey had never existed.":' 153</page><page sequence="20">Herbert Granger and who, presumably creating from the eternal materials of Light and Night, is also responsible for theogonic creation, since "first of all gods she devised Eros," tnpcItoaov pEv "Epwcra OE wv plrTiaccro nTvTwv (B13).57 A significant feature of Pherecydes' universe is that it contains super- cosmic and cosmic deities, and even a goddess who oddly straddles the two categories, the eternal, supercosmic Chthonii who provides the literal substructure of created nature, and who consequently assumes in large part the character of the generated cosmic goddess Gaia we find in Hesiod's Theogony. Above all, because of his introduction of an eternal supercosmic god, beyond nature, who creates through his craftsmanship the visible features of nature, Pherecydes should count as a precursor to those theologians who divide divinity from nature. Therefore, perhaps Theopompus is not far off the mark when he says that Pherecydes was "the first to write on nature and the gods," TIPpi p0TEOW Kai OE"v (D. L. 1.116), since his meaning might be that Pherecydes wrote of the gods and nature as distinct from one another, in contrast to Hesiod and the other theologians who mingle divinity and nature.'" A distinction between divinity and nature would be an impor- tant advance in the study of nature. A transcendent or supernatural divinity aids in the depersonalization of the nature Hesiod depicts as teeming with anthropomorphic gods and goddesses; and nothing like science would be possible when natural events are the actions of whim- 57 The language Parmenides uses to describe the activity of the goddess featured in B12, 5aipov i rtnivta KuIEpvy, is close to Aristotle's words when he reports on the activity of Anaximander's Apeiron, Kaci TEptEXEiv iiravTa Ka i rdvTa KuBEpVcV (Ph. 203b11l [A15]). The verb nEptixetv appears also in the testimonium of Hippolytus, who reports that the Apeiron "encompasses all the cosmoi" (Haer. 1.6.1 [All]); the verb is used in similar ways by Anaximenes (B2) and Anaxagoras (B2). Aristotle recognizes that those who introduce the "infinite" as their first principle, fix its "dignity" in "its containing all things and holding the all in itself,' frtEi vrTEa0Ev yE Xaclya3vouos rTiv cEspv6rrlTaT KaT&amp; TOO rETEipoU, tb nravra nEptExEtV KGai rT orTv v auroaT iXEtv (Ph. 207a18-20). The verb KU3EpvaV is used also by Heraclitus (B41) and much later by Diogenes (B5) for the providentiality of their divinity. It is worthy of note that Parmenides, in his description of the creative activity of the goddess in B13, makes use of the verb, "devise," prtiEoeati, which is close to the verb used by some Orphic authors of the demiurgic activity of their deities, e.g. Prloaro t' UXXrlv yaiav aTiptrov (F91.1 Kern). 58 Kirk et al. 1983:51 believe that the actual words of Theopompus must be more to the effect that Pherecydes was the first to write "about the gods in prose." See Schibli 1990:2n6 for a review of the different interpretations of Theopompus' phrase. 154</page><page sequence="21">The Theologian Pherecydes ofSyros sical deities.59 Pherecydes, however, does not fully reach an abstraction of divinity, but he does open the way towards it, and Anaximander may have followed Pherecydes' lead in his own placement of divinity apart from the cosmos. Anaximander is older than Pherecydes, and this is in part the reason many scholars have thought that Anaximander's book is the earlier, and insisted that he could not be influenced by the younger Pherecydes.60 The first principle of Anaximander's cosmogony is the Apeiron, and he is more likely to have chosen the word "boundless" to connote his prin- ciple's character as an unknown material substance, the "indefinite," than to indicate its character as an infinite or indeterminate expanse of material. Nevertheless, the Apeiron probably is infinite in extent, as it is infinite in time in its eternity (A15), and it lies beyond and encompasses the cosmos it gives rise to. Anaximander does not develop any form of creationism; instead, he stays within the biological model that informs the Hesiodic tradition, and which also plays a role in the theogonic side of Pherecydes' speculation. Only the testimonium of Ps.-Plutarch informs us of the coming-to-be of the cosmos in biological language: ... what arose from the eternal and is germinative of hot and cold was separated off at the birth of this cosmos, and a kind of sphere of flame from this grew around the air about the earth like bark around a tree. Strom. 2 (A10) The passage makes much use of biological language, although one cannot be certain how much of it is Anaximander's. But the biological 59 Anaximenes, however, depersonalizes nature through his depersonalization of the divine nature by making it into an everyday stuff that is common to every object in the cosmos. 60 Kahn 1960:240 points out that the Hellenistic chronologists put Anaximander's floruit thirty years before Pherecydes', and Kahn stresses Anaximander's seniority for the priority of his book over Pherecydes'. A testimonium relates that Anaximander was the leader of the Milesian colony that settled the city of Apollonia on the Pontus (A3), and his own travel may have prompted him to put his thoughts about geography into his map (D. L. 2.2). But travel and observation take time, and it is not difficult to imagine that Anaximander may have only come late in life to put into a written form his cosmological speculations. 155</page><page sequence="22">Herbert Granger language is striking, and since the tradition of theogonic and theo- cosmogonic explanation is largely biological, as we find in Hesiod and Orphic verse, it is reasonable to honor the biological details of Ps.-Plutarch's report, based probably on Theophrastus', as something close to the very words of Anaximander. What "separates off" from the "eternal," i.e. the Apeiron, is "germinative of hot and cold," and, since hot and cold do not actually exist until they blossom forth from the germ, this germ itself is neither hot nor cold, nor is the Apeiron, for that matter. These observations are in harmony with those testimonia that report that the Apeiron is "neither water nor any other of the things called elements" (A9), and these elemental materials are identified with the opposites themselves in this earliest period in cosmology.61 The phrase, r6 oK too &amp;6{iou y6vipov, is not too far from what Damascius reports of Pherecydes' theogonic stage, in which the eternal Chronos "makes from his own seed," notjact nK rOO y6voU au-ro0, fire, breath or air, and water, which as elemental substances would be versions of the "hot and cold," of "flame," and of "air about the earth." Pherecydes and Anaximander closely parallel one another in introducing elemental materials from a seed or germ, thrown off from their own version of the "eternal."62 The verb TrtOKpivEcOat, which describes how the Apeiron throws off the germ, is the standard expression for the ejection of seed,63 and its use deepens the biological dimension of Ps.-Plutarch's testimonium. Further, the word for "bark", p0ýol6q, which is derived from &amp;Xo, a verb associated with generation, can be used to indicate any skin or membrane around any sort of growing organism.64 None- theless, Anaximander's biological rendition of cosmic generation is less anthropomorphic, more abstract than Pherecydes' theogonic genera- tion, perhaps to the point that Anaximander's biological language counts only as a metaphor. It would be wrong, however, to think of 61 Arist. Ph. 204b26-28; for the opposites as "quality-things," see Cornford 1952:161-162. 62 See Schibli 1990:31-33 for a helpful comparison of Pherecydes (A8) and Anaximander (A10). 63 For this interpretation of &amp;rnoKxpVEaOat and &amp;rn6cpiait, see Baldry 1932:27n8 and Kahn 1960:156. 64 Baldry 1932:29-30 provides evidence for the biological dimension of Ps.-Plutarch's testimonium. 156</page><page sequence="23">The Theologian Pherecydes of Syros the biological images as dead metaphors. The image of the sphere of flame as what "grows around" the air "like bark around a tree" is too impressive to count as a dead metaphor, and its liveliness alone argues strongly for the authenticity of the biological language as a whole. The similarity between the words for "flame" and "bark" is a further good reason for thinking that Ps.-Plutarch in his paraphrasing makes use of the actual words of Anaximander. The genitive pXoy6g of px6( is similar in morphology to the accusative of 0pXot6R, and the similarity in form of these words underscores the metaphorical correspondence between "flame" and "bark" in their encirclements of air and tree. This nice attention to linguistic artistry looks like the hand of the original author rather than that of a doxographer. Anaximander, like Homer and Hesiod, may eschew creationism because of the debased activity of the craftsman. He may also be more determined to break with anthropomorphism, which demiurgy would vividly exemplify. Anthropomorphism still has a considerable grip on Pherecydes, despite his efforts to tame the lascivious and vicious behavior of the gods of the traditional anthropomorphic polytheism. Yet there may be a deeper reason for Anaximander's not finding divine demiurgy attractive. Despite the poetic precedent of the life-giving craftsmanship of Hephaestus, who creates Pandora from earth (Hes. Th. 571-572; "earth with water" Op. 61),65 the early natural philosophers may have simply found it puzzling how an artifact could be endowed with life, in what way intrinsically lifeless material might issue in a living creature. Living things pass on living things. This might be why Zas in his demiurgy must enlist the living goddess Chthonic-earthy material in her own right-to be literally the living foundation of what 65 In a fragment of Hesiod, Zeus is reported to have created men from stones for Deucalion after the flood (F234 Merkelbach-West [Str. 7.7.2]). The Theogony's story of Hephaestus' creation of Pandora has significant parallels with Zas' transformation of eternal ChthoniC into GE. In each case a "woman" emerges from earthy material, and is carefully adorned. Athena clothes Pandora in fine raiment and decorates her hair with flowers. She crowns Pandora with a golden crown wrought by Hephaestus with depictions of most of the animals from land and sea, so life-like they seem to give voice, ,aupdacca, 4"oto0lv oix6ra qpovlWeaotv (Hes.

Zas dresses Chthoniý with a robe of carto- graphic design he himself weaves and embroiders, and Chthonia, as so many women have managed to suggest over the ages, becomes another woman Gý merely through her dress. 157</page><page sequence="24">Herbert Granger he creates. The divine nature is required to be the basis of all else to explain how life and motion may enter the cosmos. "All things are full of gods," as Thales is famously credited with saying (Arist. de An. 411a8 [A22]). Very possibly, the atomists are the first to hold that life emerges from the intrinsically lifeless.66 The Apeiron is not, however, thoroughly divested of human-like qualities. As Aristotle reports, the Apeiron "encompasses all things and all things pilots,"' and this phrase, KCi nEpPIXEIV aTCVTta Kci R7VTL a KUIPEpvdv, is in the form of a chiasmus, a common stylistic feature of the early authors of prose, also common enough in verse.67 This ostensible artistic feature speaks to the authenticity of the passage as the words of Anaximander, and so too does the solemn hymnal quality of the passage in its close repetition of "all things."68 We find across testimonia the adjectives "ageless" (Hippol. Haer. 1.6.1 [All, B2]) and "deathless" (Arist. Ph. 203b13 [A15, B3]), which Homer often pairs, &amp;yrlpwo z' &amp;Odvatroq TE, to indicate the divinity of deities or their instruments (e.g. II. 12.323, 8.539, Od. 5.218, II. 2.447). These adjectives are never together in the same testimonium, but whether Anaximander paired them or not, they still mark the divinity of the Apeiron, and above all, by recalling the Homeric use, they underscore Anaximander's intention to displace the gods of Homer and Hesiod with the divine Apeiron.69 The impersonal nature of Anaximander's deity reflects further, and at a more advanced stage, the movement in theological speculation, perhaps initiated by Pherecydes, away from the scandalous tales of the traditional poly- theism. Yet this impersonal divinity of Anaximander has something of 66 Broadie 1999:207, however, believes that the natural philosophers found their cosmologies upon divinity because it represents the "ultimate explanation," since "presumably nothing can be divine that is reducible to terms beyond itself." Yet the divine generations beyond the first of the Hesiodic deities, although not "reducible," are also not ultimates, since they have parents. 67 Lilja 1968:133 finds the chiasmus such an abundantly common feature of the earliest prose authors that she thinks it appropriate to "speak of the chiastic bias of the earliest prose."' 68 See Jaeger 1947:30-31 with n43 on the hymnodic quality of this passage and the "hieratic repetition" of the phrase "all things." See Deichgrdber 1933 for ground-breaking work in identifying the hymnal qualities in the prose of Anaxagoras and of his probable disciple, Diogenes. 69 For the divinity of the Apeiron, see Guthrie 1962:87-89. 158</page><page sequence="25">The Theologian Pherecydes ofSyros a personal touch, as that which "pilots all things," and thus his deity may be responsible for the order in the cosmos. The surviving words of a sentence from Anaximander's book may reflect the workings of divine providence, in that the retributive principle of justice rules the exchange between the opposing cosmic forces (Bl). Hesiod and Homer would find this divine providence agreeable, since they portray Zeus as the ultimate enforcer ofjustice among humankind (e.g. Od. 13.213-214, Op. 225-247). Anaximander impressively proposes an eternal, impersonal divinity as the foundation of reality, from which our cosmos emerges, but which in no way participates in our cosmos. Only a few things are knowable about it, for instance, its permanent motion (A9), as probably a condi- tion of its being alive. The divine Apeiron is mysterious because what we know empirically is limited to the opposites and the products of their interactions, of hot, cold, moist, dry, or of fire, air, water, earth (Arist. Ph. 204b26-28); but the Apeiron, even though it gives rise to these opposites or elemental substances, is none of them, and is perhaps best understood as some sort of fusion of them in which their contending powers are neutralized,7° so that it may retain its own integrity. Thus the Apeiron lies beyond the sorts of things that make up what we may know, and, since our cosmos is limited to these sorts of things as well, the Apeiron cannot participate in our world, but remains transcen- dent in the supercosmos. This transcendence perhaps should not count as pure, since the Apeiron transcends only the physical cosmos, not physicality itself. It is physical, since it occupies space and moves. The views of Anaximander, however, are in sharp contrast with those of his younger Milesian colleague Anaximenes, who makes his own "Apeiron" observable air. Air gives rise to the cosmos, which remains thoroughly pervaded with air, as the material stuff that goes into the make-up of every worldly thing (A7). Anaximander and Anaximenes stand poles apart: the one adopts a transcendent, unknowable divinity; the other an immanent, knowable divinity, of a familiar empirical nature. Anaximander is thus closer to Hesiod than he is to either Anaximenes or 70 For the opposites as "quality-things" and the Apeiron as a fusion of them, see Cornford 1952:161-162. 159</page><page sequence="26">Herbert Granger Pherecydes in laying down, like Hesiod, a mystery behind the cosmos.71 The Hesiodic Chaos, in its dark nature, intimates the unknown from which this first-born emerges during the birth of the gods. If we had Anaximander's book, it would still not tell us much more than what we already know from the testimonial record about his deity, since silence about the unknown is what is appropriate. Xenophanes perhaps should be understood as proceeding along the same line of thought as Anaximander, since he too introduces a transcendent god, who remains, despite the many divine properties Xenophanes ascribes to this god, outside the scope of human knowledge (B34), "not at all like mortals in body or in thought" (B23). Pherecydes, in his distinction between a demiurgic god and the natural features of the world the god creates, opens the way towards a distinction between divinity and nature and ultimately towards a tran- scendent divinity outside the cosmos.72 Anaximander extracts more fully divinity from nature, and without the expedient of a creator-god. He pushes forward with a distinction between nature and divinity as supernature, which, aside from Xenophanes, the physiologoi do not follow. We do not find again a fully supernatural divinity until Plato, 71 There is a well-known debate over the extent of Hesiod's influence upon Anaximander and over what should count as the model of the Apeiron. Cornford 1952:200, esp. 189 argues that Anaximander is not an empiricist, who carefully observes nature, but instead follows the "scheme of cosmogony already provided by Hesiod and other poetical cosmogonies," and Cornford finds the antecedent of the Apeiron in Hesiod's Chaos. Stokes 1962/1963 contributes a detailed defense of cornford's proposal. Vlastos 1955:74 argues vigorously against Cornford and for the Milesians as "the creators of the scientific world- view," although oddly Vlastos displays considerable agreement with Cornford when he too locates the antecedent of Anaximander's Apeiron in the Th. of Hesiod, but in the "great chasm" (740), instead of in Chaos. Solmsen 1950 traces the Apeiron of Anaximander back to both the "chasm" and "Chaos:' West 1971:96-97, 213 finds Anaximander's prede- cessors among the Babylonians and the Iranians, and then, again, West 1994:305-307 places them among the Phoenicians. There are testimonia that put the provenance of Pherecydes' views beyond the Greek world and into the Near East: his teaching himself from "secret books of the Phoenicians" (A2) or "from the prophecy of Cham" (B2) or "from the Phoenicians" (B4). But even West 1971:3 finds these "allegations" to have "no evidential value," despite his own efforts to trace Pherecydes' thought back to the Orient. 72 Schibli 1990:56, however, takes the significance of the detachment of the artisan Zas from his artifact to be the movement towards "the idea of a separate cause," which Schibli takes to be comparable to Aristotle's "efficient cause." 160</page><page sequence="27">The Theologian Pherecydes ofSyros who, like Pherecydes, introduces a demiurgic deity who creates the cosmos, and, again like Pherecydes, upon a pre-existing material.73 It is foolish to insist that where there is a similarity there is an influ- ence, and it will probably never be known if the similarities between Pherecydes and Anaximander are due to influence.'" But the similarities are not trivial, and this alone should accord Pherecydes a significant place in the study of the early days of natural philosophy. His treatise "on nature and the gods" is a clear indication that the revolutionary theology of Anaximander occurs within a much greater movement, most of the details of which are sadly lost to us.75 WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY CONCORDANCE Kern Bernab6 Kern Bernabe 58 85 109 149 60 96 145 - 66 111 154 187 68 109 167 241 70 114 168 243 88 153 168.9 243.9 91.1 155.1 334 101 73 Plato and Aristotle perhaps never arrived at a complete separation of divinity and nature, although they place their major deity beyond nature. Plato describes the heav- enly bodies (Ti. 40b) and even the earth (Ti. 40b-c) as theos. In Aristotle's lost De philosophia he attributes divinity to the stars (Cic. De nat. deor. 2.15.42, cf. Metaph. 1074a38-blO), and in Cael. 1.9 he describes the sphere of the fixed stars, which moves eternally in a circular fashion, as "the first and highest divinity" (279a32-b3). This statement is at odds with the divine supremacy of Aristotle's transcendent unmoved mover. 74 Schibli 1990:30-33, 37 identifies parallels between Pherecydes and Anaximander, but instead of an influence of the one upon the other, Schibli suggests that Anaximander and Pherecydes depend upon a shared "climate of opinion." 75 I am grateful to the referee for HSCP for many helpful suggestions for improving my paper. 161</page><page sequence="28">Herbert Granger WORKS CITED Baldry, H.
