<plain_text><page sequence="1">King Kong: One More Interpretation, Or, What Cinema Tells About Itself Helmut Färber1 1. Background In the nocturnal harbor of New York, the ship of the adventurer and film director, Denham, stands ready for departure. Quickly, Denham finds the starlet for his new project. The next day, the ship sets out to a distant, unknown island, on which Denham seeks something to film, something that the world has never seen before. He takes screen tests on the ship with the blond woman, of her screams of terror. They actually find the island, and the Natives there want to barter for the blond woman. In the night they lead her from the ship to offer her to someone, to whom they call from the other side of the high wall that separates their village from the rest of the island: Kong. He carries the woman away. Denham's people try to follow him, but most of them meet their end in the jungle, in which horrific, prehistoric, giant animals live. Lieutenant Driscoll makes it to Kong's lair and flees with the woman. Kong follows them, destroys the native village and, as he reaches the beach, Denham brings him down with gas bombs. Back in New York. In a Broadway gala, Denham presents Kong, chained in steel shackles, to a large public. But Kong rips himself Discourse 22.2 (Spring 2000): 104-26.

In a panic-stricken and devastated nocturnal Manhattan, Kong finds her and climbs the Empire State Building with her. Planes take off to target him with machine guns. More and more seriously injured, he carefully lays the woman on a ledge and, taking several more bullets, he crashes into the depths. Denham pushes through the crowd surrounding the dead Kong. A police officer says to him, "Well, Denham, the airplanes got it." But Denham replies, "Oh no. It wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty that killed the beast." 2. The film seems to have been an immediate success in 1933. It premiered in grand fashion, opening in the Radio City Music Hall and in the RKO Roxy Theatre. Both venues had recently opened, seating together 10,000; the premiere could be thought of as a show, a spectacle much like the presentation of Kong in the film itself.2 The film cost around $672, ООО.3 By the end of 1933, it netted 2 million Dollars in the U.S., which earned the financially suffering RKO $690,000 in profits (Haver 116).4 The film was a success in the middle of the Great Depression.5 In the days that surrounded the premiere, the banks were forced once again to close. On this topic Ronald Haver notes, The absolute chaos and economic standstill that paralyzed the country in those bitter winter months had a metaphorical counterpart in the frenzy and destruction caused by the giant ape. His eventual destruction on and by the symbols of economic and technological progress reinforced audiences' subconscious sense that even the worst things imaginable could and would be overcome. Similarly, Robert Sklar states: " King Kong may have given audi- ences precisely the proper combination of fear for the survival of their society, and pleasure at seeing someone- if only a doomed gorilla- vent his rage." Adorno saw it differently in his essay about Siegfried Kracauer, " 'Caligari' " (a reference to Kracauer's From Caligari to Hitler of 1947) : "Developed and enlightened as it was, the history of German film after World War I tended toward the advanced ideology of totalitarian power. Nevertheless, such a tendency was in no way limited to German Film. It culminated in the American King Kong, truly an allegory of the excessive and regressive monster into which the public grew" (Adorno 105). 6</page><page sequence="3">106 Discourse 22.2 Fig. 1.

It is strange that a film that was so expensive in its production and demanding in its presentation had a subject like that of King Kong. The film is a curiosity in both the history of production and in the genre itself. In Hollywood's studio system, subjects of this sort of drastic imagination and fantasy never made it into anything but half-nameless, quickly and cheaply produced films that were never shown in the movie palaces and were never meant to be. Furthermore, they were the В movies and serials of the small independent studios, amusing stories for poverty row told for that adolescent public which, in its weekly visit to the movies, lived with this type of film and its heroes. 7 In the case of King Kong though, something with such inten- sity seemed to long for expression, so that it broke through the production and genre hierarchy of Hollywood. King Kong is a well-devised film.8 It is carefully formulated with all the alert Hollywood sense for the economy of the art form, for effective and efficient storytelling. It is nonetheless a film that gives the impression of being so eloquently and ambigu- ously unintentional. The film is a medium in the sense that from it, through it something speaks without its knowledge. Akin to the passivity involved in reminiscences, that something manifests itself in the film like those dreams that are nightly present, for- gotten when one awakes, but remaining, unidentified in the sub- conscience. By virtue of the power and the force of its spectacle, the film longs for interpretation, and was interpreted in many ways and, evidendy, continues to be. The film's inventor, Merian C. Cooper, rejected these interpretations (Haver 116). In his book The Making of King Kong, Orville Goldner, who was on the technical staff, did as well, as though in the name of "all the people behind the film." Many writers have tried to justify the public's love affair with a gigantic, ugly ape by reading into the film a great deal more signifi- cance than was intended by its creators. European Communists insist that when Kong smashes the gates of the native village, he symbolizes Karl Marx [that sounds inspired by apocryphal and anti-communistic sentiments] .... Others insist Kong was black in order to represent the plight of the Negro in America, who also was brought to these shores in chains and exploited by the white man. Freudians point with glee to</page><page sequence="5">1 08 Discourse 22. 2 the irony of a Kong retreating to the top of "the most elaborate phallic symbol in the world"- the Empire State Building. For Freudians, too, are the "mock crucifixion" of Kong, the "proxy gratification" of depression- angry audiences via Kong's destructive rampage in New York and so on, ad nauseam. We earnestly suggest that simple explanations are best: Kong was not darker in hue than any other gorilla, he smashed the gates solely because he wanted to recapture Fay Wray, his atrocious behaviour in the city had nothing to do with politics or economic conditions and he climbed the Empire State Building because it was the highest point in the city, corresponding to his mountain-top lair in his homeland. King Kong is exactly what it was meant to be: a highly entertaining, shrewdly conceived work of pure cinema. (Goldner 9) 4. King Kong is a film about a gigantic, prehistoric, destructive monster. Such films were numerous in the fifties in the USA and Japan. These films point to the reason behind their great numbers in their obvious interpretation: monsters come from Atom bomb testing.9 In these films raged a fully strange, pure destruction in the figure of the monster. But King Kong is concerned with a prehistoric monster that is in contact with the human world and desires a human woman. The myth "Beauty and the Beast" was given as motto already at the beginning of the film with Cooper's "Old Arabian Proverb": "And the prophet said: 'And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty. And it stayed its hands from killing. And from that day, it was as one dead'." It is formulated three times by Denham, the producer/ director in the film: the first time as the idea of the film he plans, the second time at the presentation of King Kong in New York, and the last time in his closing statement, where Denham conceives of an idea for a film, but which was actually intended as a postscript for the Cooper/Schoedsack film itself. These shifts in reality determine the entire constitution of the film, that the film consciously and then also unintentionally operates with such exchanges: from the film King Kong to Denhams film in the film and back to the film from Cooper/Schoedsack; from the film King Kong to Kong the figure; from the distant, unreal island to the nocturnal, unreal real city of New York. The film emanates strongly from reality, and indeed finds and defines reality. As a result of this, it oscillates between film and reality, and between different levels of reality.10</page><page sequence="6">Spring 2000 109 "Beauty and the Beast" is the interpretation Cooper through Denham emphatically gives to his film as his own, once and for all and to exclude any other.11 The myth found in the traditional fairytale, in this context, is changed. The monster, the animal, is not saved or changed through the woman's love; nor is it saved by loving and sacrificing itself for the woman; it dies from it. In the sense of another, related fairytale motif, the Kong char- acter can be understood as the dragon, the dark, threatening side of the groom, whereas Lieutenant Driscoll can be seen as the light side. He's like the prince that defeats the dragon and saves the woman, whom he wins for himself. But this motif, within this context, also appears in a deformed, defective rendition. Driscoll, the prince, does not really defeat the monster. An anonymous technical power, the airplanes, which were only Driscoll's idea, defeats Kong. The film portrays the airplanes' role in the defeat of the monster am- bivalently This interpretation contradicts that of Driscoll's function as savior. 12 In addition, both of these old motifs are infiltrated by a new one. It inserted itself, uninvited and it pervades the entire story: the motif of exploitation. Exploited are the woman, the natives, and Kong, enticement for the film viewer/ consumer, as much from Denham's film as the film from Cooper/Schoedsack. A profitable enterprise is glorified as an adventurous undertaking, but in the process, through the film itself, is also recognized as a destructive undertaking. Motif interpretations such as these always seem only to apply to certain areas within the film. An interpretation should apply to a film in its entirety, to the whole story from beginning to end, and again to the specific constitution of the film: (1) Each alternation of the film, between the different levels of reality, from King Kong the film to Kong the figure; (2) The strange emptiness of this figure, through which it is set to take on most different interpretations, as Roger Dadoun shows in his excellent study of the film; (3) Further, tendencies of dream logic, of which Freud spoke in his essay, "About the Counter-Meaning of Original Words ("Ur- worte") (1910): "the special tendency of dreamwork (Traumar- beit) to express contradictions through the same means of pre- sentation;" a "regressive, archaic characteristic of the expression of thoughts;" (4) And still further: some deterioration comes from the ap- pearance of these archaic images and motifs, unforeseen tendencies of flatness, infantalism, self-parody. The film is not only unaware of</page><page sequence="7">110 Discourse 22. 2 Fig. 2. Michele Benzamin, Parnassus Productions, 1979. what it contains, it also doesn't want to know anything about it. But it's through these defects that the film attains what it tells about itself, about its own and general unconsciousness. 5. The film is about a film that doesn't get shot. King Kong begins with the launch of a film expedition that someone calls "crazy." Myr- iad illegalities are committed by a "crazy fellow," a solo entrepreneur,</page><page sequence="8">Spring 2000 111 who is an adventurer and businessman all in one. The character of Carl Denham is the mythic, ideal portrait of an entrepreneur from the time when the foundations of the film industry were being laid. It is, moreover, and intentionally so, a portrait of Merian C. Cooper, who like Denham, made films, together with Ernest B. Schoedsack, in distant places and under extreme conditions.13 More Background Merian C. Cooper (1894-1973) was of Scottish and Irish de- scent. He left the Marine academy early, was a merchant sailor and then a reporter. As a National Guardsman, he fought against Pancho Villa; he was a pilot for France in the First World War and then in the Polish army against the Soviet Union. He was shot down on both occasions. He escaped after ten months of Russian imprisonment. He traveled quite a lot as a reporter for the New York Times. He, along with Schoedsack, signed up for a world expedition; the films they shot in Ethiopia were burned; in 1925 in Kurdistan, Cooper made the famous film Grass , about the toilsome journey of a people that took months and covered hundreds of miles. From there they were contracted to make a film in the jungles of Thailand, Chang. Cooper later worked off and on for the airline industry, other times for the film industry. In the forties and the fifties he produced for John Ford.14 Ernst B. Schoedsack (1893-1979) , torn from his home, worked in road construction. In 1914 he was a cameraman for Keystone/ Mack Sennett. During WW! and after, he was a news cameraman in Europe. Schoedsack first met Cooper around 1919/20 in the Polish- Soviet war. Later, through the mediation of Cooper, he worked for the New York Times. Before King Kong he shot footage in India for Lives of a Bengal Lancer , footage that was ruined. He suffered permanent eye damage in the Second World War while testing photographic materials at great altitudes.15 When they made King Kong, Cooper was 39 and Schoedsack 38. They can both be seen towards the end of their film amongst the pilots. Cooper is quoted as saying: "Let's kill the son-of-a-bitch ourselves" (Haver 108, similarly Goldner 173). This film expedition of Denham's starts out in search of some- thing mysterious, fabled in a distant, unfamiliar world, "something monstrous, all powerful still living that no white man has ever seen," as Denham says, in order to find and film it. What Denham thereby invests beyond his ambition and manhood is the blond woman, her scream of terror.16</page><page sequence="9">112 Discourse 22.2 6. The appearance of the island in the film is incomparable: the fog over the sea, black birds flying everywhere, from a distance the dull rhythm of drums, and then, looming, the coastal line and towering above it, the massive cliffs in the form of a skull. These are images as only the cinema, from its darkness, can produce, whose black and white immateriality contains a certain corporal vagueness through which foreboding memories/ reminiscence can take shape. The devouring, gleaming depth of the jungle; the immense gate in that enormous wall made of tree trunks, which separates the world of the natives, of humans, from the rest of the island. The fragile way over the abyss, in the depths of which creep horrible beings. Upon the jungle waters float the hastily built raft of the invaders, who are already lost; it's like another "Raft of Medusa;" the water's surface is undisturbed; it is covered by a mist. Rising out of it, silent and like silence itself, the gigantic, leviathan head of a snake. (But, because the film doesn't want to admit to these images, doesn't acknowledge or tolerate them, the monster becomes a Punch show dragon, chewing on a human doll in slapstick manner) . Still later more images take shape with Kong's cavernous lair, almost ceremoniously situated at the highest point above the expansive sea; vapors rise, as in the cave of Delphi, from the rifts in the rocks. Another perfect example already at the beginning of the film and in the second part: the images of nocturnal New York, of which Denhem speaks as though it were a jungle; the crowd, all strangers to one another; the woman alone above in the dizzying heights, in Kong's hand, underneath in the abyss the masses who themselves make up an abyss. Memory forms its own images from the individual passing images of the film. It was the ingenuity of Willis H. O'Brien, the chief technician, Mario Larrinaga and Byron L. Crabbe, the art technicians that discovered the images of the film. These images were achieved through the inventiveness of these three technicians and the de- voted communal craft of all those involved. Cinema inherited the bourgeois aesthetic requirements of the 19th century: the need for illusion, the illusion of probability, the illusion of identification.17 The film industry of the first half of the twentieth century, including Hollywood despite its "Fordist principles" of mass production and division of labor, benefited from the tradition of production as craft that remained from the nineteenth century.18 This tradition included the ethic: to be one with one's work, to love it, to take pride in it, the love of craft,</page><page sequence="10">Spring 2000 113 the desire to accomplish a difficult feat, the joy of creation that is beautiful, full of worth, and in which the joy of the craft is seen. The testimonies of Hollywood technicians, production artists tell of it. Goldner's book The Making of King Kong is such an example. And the films themselves tell of it. One of the latest films, to which this craft gave its greatness, is Walt Disney's melancholy Jules Verne film, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (Richard Fleischer, 1954). There is a certain related attention in King Kong to give the jungle large expansive depth through a staggering of several visual layers, with increasing light toward the background. Illustrations from Gustave Doré were the model for the entire cinematic style, for the lighting effects as well as individual visual motifs.19 7. The whites' arrival on the island, their interference, and their desire to film disturb and ruin the ceremony of offering Kong a bride. To compensate for this, because of the special worth the ceremony held, and because the whites denied her to them, the natives abduct the "blond woman" and give her freely over to Kong. Once the whites seek to recover the precious woman in the territory on the other side of the wall, once they force their way into Fig. 3. Photo Still from King Kong (1933).</page><page sequence="11">114 Discourse 22. 2 the other side opposite the human world, in which they are chased by horrific prehistoric monsters, and once they take the woman away from Kong, the order that existed between both sides of the island is destroyed. Uncalled, Kong appears at the gate, breaks it open and is stunned by gas bombs once he reaches the beach to which Denham entices him. Meanwhile, most of the natives are killed, their culture destroyed. And perhaps there is also a destruction of the order on the other side of the wall, in that, earlier, the other monsters started fighting with Kong over the women and Kong killed them all. Or a condition ended: the monster interested in humans con- quers those that remained distant to them. They also want to possess the woman, which only spells their death. On the other hand, Kong only wants to keep the woman with him, without killing her. The story, and not only that of this film, never divulges what happened between him and the woman (and the sacrificial bride before). In a series of battles, which are for Kong a series of obsta- cles to win the woman for himself- Tyrannosaur us Rex, snakelike Elasmosaurus, flying Pterodactyl- in the obvious pleasure in the virtuosity of its own special effects, to half voluntary comedy, the most infantile characteristics of the film are most apparent. It's as though the film acknowledges them itself, perhaps also to lessen the maelstrom of aggression while it's at it. It is less conscious of how it, all to obviously, depicts the helplessness of humans away from civilization and in this prehistoric world and its way of existence, so that they appear almost laughable in their desperation, faced with death. The survivors can think of nothing better than to save themselves with gas bombs. Triumphantly, Denham stands next to the lifeless, prostrate Kong : "Why, the whole world will pay to see this. He's always been king in his world, but we'll teach him fear. We're millionaires, boys. I'll share up with all of you. Why, in a few months it'll be up in lights on Broadway . . . Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World!" 8. Thus, the film is not merely about a monster and a woman. It concerns the meeting of two cultures. The one is Western civi- lization, to which the film itself belongs, and which the film shows in its most advanced state, represented by New York, the Broadway Gala, and the Empire State Building.20 Still, through the elevated train sequence, added at the end of production, a slice of the gray exhaustion of the everyday lives of the nameless masses also enters into the film.21</page><page sequence="12">Spring 2000 115 This Western culture collides with another, characterized by a magical understanding of the world. What establishes the link between the two is a film, a film expedition, which is drawn to search for something distant, something strange, an attraction that promises big business. In the film, within the film, a part of the business, is the blonde woman, the erotic phantasmagoria. Western culture, despite its fascinating appearance, finds itself at this moment in a chaotic and desolate state, as a result of the Great Depression. The whole mood of the film communicates this state, and within the telling of the story itself, it is marked memorably from the very beginning. At night in Manhattan, Denham is on a search for an actress, for a woman for his film. He finds her, helping her, as the police are to be called, out of desperation and hunger (she wanted to steal an apple) . Censors, who began operating in the intervening period presumably in 1938 with the re-release of the film, suppressed this key scene.22 During this time the film expedition is undertaken. The film results from Western culture on a search; the distant, fabled island will be found, and as its King/ God: Kong. The meanings overlap in perfect opposition, in that the Kong Crisis and Depression are, in Adorno's terms, the "regressivity of civic being" and its other, a sort of counter force, simultaneously. Within the strange world of the island, Kong does not appear destructive. It is a remarkable quality of the film that it represents this so. Upon the island, a human and a more powerful world exist side by side in a sort of stable, ever newly stabilized tension. Where both meet, they are also divided, by the violent log wall of the native village. The wall was erected a long time ago. This border, the film gives us to understand, is recognized by both sides. The gigantic gate found there is only opened for one act, which renews the balance between both sides: the sacrifice of a bride. When Kong appears at the gate for the first time he is called with a large ceremony, with the three rings of the gong that signal its conclusion. As he comes and carries away the offering, there is, between him and the natives who follow his action with the utmost excitement, a form of mutual greeting. This is a critical moment within the film. It may be that Kong, who is the only one of the giant creatures on the other side of the wall to share a relationship with the natives, has something like a pro- tector role. It is a strange order, one that cannot be comprehended by the whites in the film as order, but only as something horrible and barbaric, and which the film itself can in no way allow to persist. However, such an order is discernable in the film, is attained in the film, before the film seizes upon it and transforms it.</page><page sequence="13">116 Discourse 22.2 This order that governs the island is first disturbed by the intruders, and then destroyed. The conquerors finally take the power of this strange culture for themselves, through the use of the woman, who no longer serves as a sacrificial bride, but as bait. The power is broken, dulled, dispersed; only its strangeness carries currency now, as Denham explains to his audience in New York: "He was the king and god of the world he knew, but now he comes to civilization merely a captive, a show to gratify your curiosity." Still, the captive, shackled, humiliated to stupefaction, pho- tographed, and exhibited for money, frees himself once again.23 And now Kong becomes even more destructive, searching for the sacrificial bride that was first promised him, then taken away. Thus, just as on the distant island, the confrontation of the two cultures leads here too to catastrophe, for in the end this confrontation is only conceivable for the film as a catastrophe. Now the sacrifice is Kong, conquered by civilization. On the island he was subdued with gas, now he is killed by dive bombers. The film allows Kong, in his death, to appear grandiose once more. When, however, the destruction, the horror, the panic of the citizens of nocturnal New York is also conjured up, as if the terrible and the horrifying are at the same time longed for and thrilling, this film is still not the first time that catastrophe is transformed, seemingly of its own accord, into the fascinating. The addiction to accidents, catastrophes, destruction, and self-destruction was already a hallmark of Western civilization at the time of the film and this has only become more obvious since.24 9. The confrontation of cultures is, in the end, driven to extremes, as Kong endeavors to take possession of the highest point on this other island, the Empire State Building. This was not, at that time, that trusty old Empire State Building of today, but rather the highest, boldest, most modern building in the world, barely open for two years. Its builders had, therefore, given it the title: 'The Eighth Wonder;" its entrance displayed colorful, lighted glass pictures of the seven traditional wonders, pictured together with the eighth new wonder.25 'The Eighth Wonder of the World" is also the tide that Kong receives from Denham, as well as one of the titles that Cooper and Schoedsack considered for the film.26 Subsequently, in an impressive equation between achievement and mistake, it suggests</page><page sequence="14">Spring 2000 117 both Kong and his Film, as the alter egos of the Empire State Building and the entrepreneurial spirit that produced it. The Sphinx of Giza, the Colossus of Rhodes, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the Statue of Liberty, Radio City Music Hall ("as signif- icant in our generation as to have built the pyramids" according to the New York Daily News inl937 [Francisco 36] ) , Mount Rushmore, which had just come into being at the time of King Kong ("each face twice as high as the head of the Giza Sphinx" [Encyclopedia Americana 1992 edition]): in the USA, in the expanse of this new continent, a renewal of the monumental, of archaic antiquity had taken place- a renewal that was not mediated by ancient Europe. The US perhaps remembers its own dawn as the very dawn of civ- ilization altogether. Thus persists a wholly peculiar intertwining of mythical and historic memory. For the US, the Homeric heroes lived at the same time as Lincoln, Queen Victoria, Darwin, and Marx. The story of Kong would have been difficult to conceive in Europe. With it, with the figure and the film, which knows to blindly place itself together with the newest, most modern wonders, is memory, obtained differently than the European, which was devel- oped and mediated by centuries of culture and literature. This new memory stretched back much earlier still, thrown back possibly to a pre-history, in which the superhuman had not yet turned to stone, to a picture, but instead was in living contact with human beings. 10. Digression A memory from the earliest pre-historic times appears as the present. Within the film, however, another type of operation takes place, moving in the opposite direction. Something that is not so distant moves to a great distance, it becomes distant. Among the numerous symmetries that appear in the film, and which make it so intriguing, the most important is that of the distant island and New York, of Skull Island and Manhattan.27 "Our first view of Skull Island, through Denham's map, could easily be mistaken for the island of Manhattan" (Judith Mayne) . How far the correspondence extends first becomes apparent when an old map of Manhattan, roughly corresponding to 'The Duke's Plan" of 1664, is consulted. Just like on Skull Island, Manhattan too is only the tip, upon which the people have settled, of a larger land mass. And just as on Skull Island, this area is protected in Manhattan from the larger portion of the island with a high wall. Aboard the ship, as Denham comments about the map of the island to Driscoll and the Captain, he explains the wall: "The natives</page><page sequence="15">118 Discourse 22. 2 Fig. 4. Manhattan, The Duke's Plan. keep that wall in repair. They need it. . . . There's something on the other side of it. Something they fear." "A hostile tribe," supposes the Captain. What does not apply to Skull Island, did, however, apply to the island of Manhattan. The "hostile tribe" was for the Dutch settlers, the English. And it was also the Indians, the original inhabitants of this land. In its constitution too, the "Palisade Wall," erected in 1653, was also similar to the wall on Skull Island. "Posts twelve feet high and about seven inches in diameter were erected, and covered on the outside with boards" (Harrison and Lamb 1: 164). The transference of the wall (and the fear) from one island (and culture) to another; the substitution for the "hostile tribe" of the aboriginal peoples of this land, a specific and appropriated substitution of them with Kong, represents, however, a sublimated thought, one which is less a conscious idea than it is the visible account of the violence of a nightmare. To locate this peculiar conjunction, there exists yet another clue in King Kong. Just as with Kong, the most famous member of the American "hostile tribe" was also exhibited to a paying public: Sitting Bull. Sitting Bull's role in Buffalo Bill's "Wild West Show" [1885] was pre- ordained through his past, as the supposed conqueror of Custer. Indeed, he did not have to participate in the performance itself, which consisted</page><page sequence="16">Spring 2000 119 of dramatic scenes from life in the Western frontier. His role consisted more specifically of just "being himself' and of riding around the arena at the appointed time. Whenever he did this, he was forced to endure the curses and abuses of the crowd, which he nevertheless allowed to pass over him with complete composure. Later, after public opinion had already changed in favor of the "Sedentary Taurus" in Boston, Sitting Bull was celebrated as a hero in Canada- he had finally beaten Uncle Sam and sought refuge in Canada. Even though Sitting Bull enjoyed the celebration that greeted him, there were still moments when he was exhausted and fatigued. Besides this, he was also concerned about the increasingly horrible conditions at Standing Rock.28 (Feest 24) Calling to mind, even today, this long lost wall on the island of Manhattan, is the name of the stretch along which it once ran: Wall Street. 11. The film King Kong concerns an expedition of Western culture, undertaken during difficult times, into another, fabled culture. It is robbed of its strength, its power, the culture destroyed. Its power, degraded and misused by Western culture, becomes destructive, whereupon it must and can be destroyed by Western culture- for both cultures, it is a matter of the polarities existing within one culture in particular, our own. The expedition that the film shows, and which it is, the Holly- wood film, draws energies from the unconscious and gives them a visual form. Through this it affords the forgotten, the repressed, the archaic a violent and visible appearance, even where it is otherwise only invisibly present, in the midst of civilization. The photographic, cinematic medium, where its possibilities are realized, as in this film, is capable of making visions of fantasies and dreams, the events of dreams visible. Indeed, at the same time transformations occur. When the monstrous, almost unimaginable, only indirectly conceivable receives an all too direct and visible form, the most crucial quality of these images and manifestations is lost, as soon as the unimaginable is made imaginable, the invisible made visible, the inconceivable made conceivable. The images that emerge after that are different than the images of myth. They are no longer of use for anything, no longer of use for insight and self-recognition . What King Kong forces out of the film through such compar- isons, is that he contains both within himself, that his story succeeds with images and memories, with which practical human sense wants nothing to do, as Denham and Cooper so impressively illustrate; but</page><page sequence="17">1 20 Discourse 22. 2 that on the other hand the figure of Kong reverts again and again into a dumb, naked monstrosity, thereby changing the entire film from a conjuring of myths, a utilization of myths, to a travesty of myths, so that it is only through crass brutality that it pulls itself out of the ridiculous. The film is of interest precisely because of this, its simultaneous ability and inability to remember its own pre-history and history, both past and present. It is as if both, its use and its destruction of myth, are tied to each other. The most productive artifice of the film is the displacement of reality, the idea of bringing Kong himself to New York- it is exactly at this point where the break, the jump is to be found. One would like to imagine for a moment that others could have experienced and reported the incredible events of this film long before Denham. Odysseus or Sindbad might have brought back such animate, even living evidence of their adventures. At the same time, it is doubtless what would have happened: with one stroke the whole story would have sunk into oblivion, as everyone would have lost all sense and ability to speak about what is on the other side of human experience, about that which only allows itself to be told through stories. What remains strongest in the memory about the film King Kong is the intensity and inventiveness of its images, the images of Kong's death.29 The film surrounds him with sadness, and is in the end almost capable of lending to his form a certain touching dignity, helpless against the brutality that meets him: modern- though to- day these airplanes appear antiquated- perfect technological rea- son, a share of the dead ritual which they contain, completely unconscious. It is, then, as if the Film is not only about the end of this figure, this mythology, but also without even knowing it, about an end of mythology.30 12. The end of Kong certainly consummates such an end of mythol- ogy. After his death in the film, Kong remains alive in the real New York and is at home there, connected to the city, its appearance, and its self-perception. Surprising that the great Steinberg did not incorporate him in his Mythologica. In some representations Kong is seen together with the Empire State Building, less its alter ego as in the film, and more like its buddy. Here it becomes apparent, that this structure still possesses anthropomorphic traces, which vanish with other, later structures. Kong is, however, also a figure unto himself, as trusted as Santa</page><page sequence="18">Spring 2000 121 Claus, who as such is often dressed up for greeting cards, and like Santa Claus he is also used freely in advertising. At the same time, to the extent that there is anything that is outside the realm of advertising, Kong is in New York, the mascot for and symbol of New York. He belongs to the general mythological junk, where the difference between horror and high jinx is trivial. Still, even such junk can have- and receive- use value, in that sense, in which myth has it, as a means to get through life. Of this, there are the smallest traces. Fig. 5.

For a further detailed description see Erb 52-62. According to Cooper's original idea, Kong should be exhibited in New York- in the film- "in the new Radio City Music Hall, then being built, and it was that area that suffered most of his rampage. But Selznick pointed out 'We're going to get in ajam with Radio City executives by the circus nature of the stunt we place there, by contrast with the dignified efforts they are making.' Cooper reluctantly changed Kong's New York debut to the Polo Grounds" (Haver 101, abridged). In Germany the film debuted on December 1, 1933, "in 30 premier theaters and 13 motion picture theaters of the Reich at the same time." 3 Concerning the production history except for Goldner and Haver, see American Film Institute (AFI) Catalog 1102-1104, or Erb 31-41. 4 Cf. Erb 41, and 51-52: At that time the studio [RKO] had established a standard production cost of $200,000 for its features. Estimates of the actual cost of the film vary. Wray states that the film ultimately cost about $680,000. Although quite successful in box office terms, the film apparendy failed to meet the studio's inflated expectations for it. King Kong was an unusually expensive film to produce to market. King Kong proved unable to compete against some of the biggest hits released at this time, including 42nd Street , She done him wrong , and Cavalcade. In its first release, then, King Kong's box office performance was good, but uneven. 5 See Haver 113, 116. See also Sklar 179. 6 There are no substantial comments known from Kracauer himself concerning King Kong also according to the friendly information provided by Frau Professor Dr. Inka Mülder-Bach (München, August 1999), who worked on an edition of Kracauer's film script. 7 See Zinman. 8 For more on well-devised film: origin of the script December 1931 until September 1932 see Erb 37-41, 213. Cf. Haver 80-87, 101-102 and AFI Catalog 1102-1103. 9 The monsters were thawed from arctic ice through atom bomb testing (The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms Eugene Lourie/Warner, USA 1953, production costs, $400,000, earnings, $5 million); or stirred up ( Godzilla , King of the Monsters Inoshiro Honda/Toho, Japan 1954); or they were produced by mutations (Them! Gordon Douglas/Warner, USA 1954.) In a film from 1971, the monster emerges from the poisonous chemicals in the sea (Gojira Tai Hedor Yoshimitu banno/Toho, Japan 1971).</page><page sequence="20">Spring 2000 123 10 Concerning ape/gorilla men in research and literature see Gottes- man 21-25; concerning ape movies before and after King Kong see Gottes- man 25-27. 11 For the Beauty/Beast motif: stories of myth/fairytale motif from Apuleius see Gottesman 19-21. 12 For the dragon/prince motif see Brickman 30-31. 13 Denham has been interpreted as a portrait of Cooper: Haver quotes Cooper " (Ruth Rose) made Denham and Driscoll very much like Schoed- sack and myself' (102); and Goldner states that "Denham is a personality composite of Cooper and Schoedsack" (7). 14 Gallagher's Biography of Cooper is a much too praiseworthy book. 15 Biography of Schoedsack id from various sources. The wonderful record of Schoedsack being with Stroheim in Death Valley for "Greed," is unfortunately based on a mistake. (According to friendly information from Richard Kozarski, Sacile, October 1999.) 16 For more on the cry of terror see the excellent passage in Dadoun "Développement d'un cri dans l'espace filmique" (113-114). 17 On the Nineteenth Century bourgeois aesthetic Jean-Luc Godard writes in his video essay "Histoire (s) du Cinema," "... mais il faut se souvenir que le dix-neuvième siècle qui a inventé toutes les techniques a inventé aussi la bêtise" (lb). 18 Cf. Bordwell et al. 19 Goldner references individual Doré illustrations and hypothesizes that О 'Brian could have become familiar with Doré around 1930, through advice from "cameraman and special effects expert Louis W. Physioc" ( 1 36) . Haver compares a Doré-Stich depiction of Milton's Paradise Lost with a drawing by О 'Brian and Br yon Crabbe. Concerning picture quality, William K. Ever son indicates that- since 1938?- copies of the film have been made intentionally darker in order to hide the more bloody details, which has generally caused much of the richness of the details and the sharpness of the graphics of the pictures to be lost. (Evidence of this comes from Rolf Giesen, Alles über Kong, companion brochure to the VHS-Video-Edition 60 Happy Birthday King Kong , Limited Edition. Ismaning/Munich: Taurus Video, 1993. "Uncut, digitally restored version.") 20 For New York in the film see the collection of essays and accounts of filmography from 1927-1986, New York, New York. La citta , il mito , il cinema. Regarding King Kong see 65-66. 21 About the production of this sequence with nice diagrams see Goldner 179-184. 22 Regarding this and further cuts of the censor, see the following passage: from Dadoun's Déplacements et réductions idéologiques de la censure ,</page><page sequence="21">1 24 Discourse 22. 2 111-112; for enumerations of the censor cuts, Goldner 208-209, Haver 116, AFI Catalog 1104. This scene- a which was also cut in copies of the film circulating in Germany around 1945- was not named. 23 King Kong exhibited for money in New York: 'These tickets cost me twenty bucks," states a young man in front of the theater to his girl friend, and then backstage Denham remarks to Driscoll: Well, Jack, ten thousand dollars in the box office. How's that for one night, huh?" His response, "oh, that's nothing. We're going to do that every night," proves to be mistaken; the Kong spectacle ends- the film virtually forgets to tell- with Denham's ruin (or with that of his insurance company) . 24 On addiction to catastrophes see Klaus Heinrich, "Sucht und Sog. Zur Analyse einer aktuellen gesellschaftlichen Bewegungsform." The writings of this exceptional philosopher, who inexplicably is still not known in the French and English speaking worlds, are most emphatically recommended. 25 The Encyclopedia Americana 1992 edition states that the Empire State Building was the "tallest building of the world from 1931 to 1970 [and] remains in the popular mind the epitome of building skill and a vital symbol of New York." "Because it opened during the Great Depression, the building was partially empty and a commercial failure until World War II. But it was immediately successful as a symbol of American enterprise." Regarding the skyscraper as a symbol of the USA, see also Gottesman 27-29. Before the Empire State Building there was incidentally already an- other monument that had been extolled as 'The Eighth Wonder of the World," the Rathaus of Amsterdam, built in 1648-1665: 'The building was on an unprecedented scale: it was the greatest town hall in Europe. It made an overwhelming impression in its own time" (W. Kuyper) . The city of New Amsterdam had already been founded. 26 For more on "The Eighth Wonder" as a title for the film see Erb note 23 on page 213. 27 On symmetries in the film Dadoun states that "strict principe de symétrie inversée qui gouverne la totalité du film" (115). Erb says that "almost every element seems to 'rhyme' with something in the film" (40). 28 Roswitha Mueller kindly pointed out the correspondence between Kong and Sitting Bull to me. 29 Cf. Dadoun, "King Kong misérable, sur le point de subir le sort de ses victimes, 1' écrasement; la bête venue de la jungle passe la main; les avions, merveille du monde contemporain, prennent la relève: Guernica, Coventry, Hambourg, Dresde, Hiroshima, Vietnam" (115)- Iraq 1991, Yugoslavia 1999. 30 Erb notes "... and yet when surveying the overall history of King Kong's reception in the American culture from the 1930s to the present, I would contend that it is ultimately King Kong' s potential for the generation</page><page sequence="22">Spring 2000 125 of various kinds of liberation and protest works that help to guarantee its place as 'mass myth' in American and international culture" (205).
