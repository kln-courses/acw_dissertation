<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCHANGE AND ALIENATION IN THE JAJMANI SYSTEM Daniel Miller Department of Anthropology, University College London, Gower Street, London WCIE 6BT, England Criticisms are given both of early attempts to define the jajmani system in South Asia on the basis of selected attributes and of recent attempts to dismiss the concept altogether. An alternative approach is constructed using the example of the distribution of pottery in a Malwa village. This approach examines the tendency towards fixity in the exchange of services and its relation to the market. The assumption that jajmani is a traditional system undermined by monetization is questioned. Several other approaches are reexamined and shown to emphasize the secondary articulation of formal exchange with other aspects of village social organization. A more general analysis follows recent work on the Kula in suggesting that systems of embedded exchange may be understood as a praxis which ameliorates the alienation intrinsic to circulation, which in the case of jajmani may be fostered both by the division of labor and by monetization. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS paper is to address the nature of the jajmani system; this concern implies a defense of the proposition that such a system exists and that the often diverse phenomena which have been included within the category should indeed be united under a common interpretation. This is by no means obvious, since some recent papers on the subject have had the rejection of any such unifying concept as one of their major aims. A move has been made towards stressing the particularity of specific cases and their overall variability when presented as examples of the system, suggesting the invalidity of any analytical transcendence of such individual cases. The defense of a unified approach rests on a theory about the nature of the underlying concerns which generate the phenomena. This will be proposed not only with respect to specific South Asian conditions but also in terms of a more general question regarding the intrinsically problematic nature of exchange. One outcome of the expressivist element in the philosophy of Hegel and the early Marx is the supposition that productive activity, both intellectual and physical, results in a close association between subject and object, such that the product of individual or, more commonly, group activities is, in part, an objectification of their social being (Miller 1987). If the conditions of production are not in themselves alienating, in the sense of the early Marx, it follows that the activity of exchange is always problematic, since in that activity objects must pass from the producing group. Indeed if a capitalist society is identified as one in which the conditions of production are alienating, then the problem is particularly acute for noncapitalist societies in which this "natural" relation of subject and object has been allowed to develop and the object of exchange therefore always incorporates a social identity. 535</page><page sequence="2">536 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH The problem of the alienation intrinsic to exchange is exacerbated both by a pronounced division of labor with a high degree of specialist activity and also by the development of a cash economy which is often accompanied by a relative autonomy of exchange media from the specific social characteristics of the exchange partners. In response to these problems, many societies have de- veloped complex strategies which often take the form of a structured rela- tionship between spheres of relatively fixed and embedded exchange and spheres of relatively flexible and disembedded exchange. These strategies ensure that the social being which passes from the producer in the act of exchange returns to itself. Such an approach which considers exchange as a social, rather than simply an economic, activity also has critical implications for the evolutionary premise found in many anthropological accounts of the development of cash or market transactions. The jajmani system will be analyzed as a particular example of this more general tendency. It will be shown to consist of a characteristic articulation between fixed or embedded exchange relations and the cash economy in many South Asian villages. Having addressed the underlying factors which account for the existence of the phenomena, I shall then relate the variability of the actual examples found in ethnographic accounts to the secondary articulation between this social strategy and a wide variety of other contextual features of South Asian rural society. As a first step, a brief review will be given both of the various approaches within the literature which have followed Wiser's (1936) initial anthropological identification of the jajmani system and of the reasons for the current tendency towards the rejection of any such general category. This will be followed by an account of one example of a system, which, although going by a different name, may serve as the starting point for an argument towards generalities. This example comprises the forms of distribution employed by six pottery- making households in a village in the Malwa region of Central India.' Starting from this case study, I shall propose a general model on the grounds that virtually all the examples in the literature comprise a fixed "embedded" system of exchange in contrast to and together with a disembedded flexible system of exchange. This implies that an interpretation of the tendency towards formalized exchange must itself be the pivot for any general analysis of the system. This will be related firstly to specific Hindu concepts, such as that of jati dharma, which in turn provide a foundation for reexamining the several current interpretations of the jajmani system and recasting them in terms of the present argument. Finally the example of jajmani will be incorporated into the wider understanding of the nature of exchange in anthropology, in part through a comparison with recent writing on the Melanesian Kula. In conclusion it will be suggested that the jajmani system may be understood as a kind of praxis, by which certain philosophical ideals related to the question of social identity and alienation are constructed through practical action rather than solely through theoretical concepts.</page><page sequence="3">EXCHANGE AND ALIENATION 537 CURRENT INTERPRETATIONS The popular presentation of the jajmani system suggests that it is virtually synonymous with the internal village economic system centered on patron- client relations. As such, it has been appropriated by a wide variety of an- thropological perspectives. According to the older, functionalist interpretations, it was held to provide the supportive relationships which balanced the disruptive caste system (Wiser 1936); that is, caste was seen to split the village into units which were rendered cohesive again by the jajmani system. In other accounts the main focus of village economics was said to be the contracts between the major landowners and the remaining members of the village. The jajman was the wealthy patron who used the system to procure the services he required, exploiting the divisions of labor represented by the caste system. A general textbook (Maloney 1974:230-32) provides a typical description of this simplified and economistic kind, with emphasis being laid upon the services which the artisan castes provide and the proportion of the harvest which they may expect to receive in return. Closely connected with this interpretation are a series of analyses which do not deny this basic characterization but rather use it to portray the essentially exploitative nature of the system, arguing against the integrationist element by a focus upon conflict (e.g., Beidelman 1959; Lewis and Barnouw 1967). The two approaches may be combined when the functionalist assumption of integration is viewed as mystificatory legitimation for class exploitation by both analyst and analyzed (Meillassoux 1973). In these analyses, the relationship between artisans and ritual specialists is often combined with the different kinds of contract specific to agricultural labor, although most ethnographies distin- guish between the two. It is precisely this confusion of terms and contracts and the continued sub- sumption of ever more variable examples within this overarching category, such that many cases bear little resemblance to Wiser's original model of the jajmani system, which accounts for the current popularity of a very different approach. Following an earlier plea by Pocock (1962), much recent work crit- icizes the normative view, which represented a constant and simplified system of relationships, and points rather to the regional diversity and the differences in contractual arrangements held by different kinds of artisan and ritual spe- cialists within any one village (Parry 1979:59-83), arguing in some cases for the abandonment of a single term such as jajmani (e.g., Good 1982). Unfor- tunately, although such an approach has characterized some of the most sen- sitive and detailed interpretations of the phenomenon within the context of local ethnographies, the effect is a relativism which would tend to abandon not only the term jajmani but also any anthropological interpretation in which a pervasive tendency in South Asian villages is identified and related to questions of social theory. In an attempt to question both the traditional models and these recent trends,</page><page sequence="4">538 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH I will start with a specific example. The intention is not to generalize from this case alone but to use it to form a model which directly addresses the nature of the observable variability of practices within a theoretical framework. THE DISTRIBUTION OF POTTERY IN A MALWA VILLAGE The particular example used here derives from a larger study of the variability of pottery in a single village (Miller 1985), and the initial concern was merely with the mechanisms by which these pots were distributed from the 6 house- holds of potters' caste who produce them to the remaining 259 households of the village. The pragmatic jat farmers, known for being relatively unorthodox in religious terms (Bayly 1983:61-62), are the dominant caste of the village, making up 22.6 percent of the population but owning over half the village land. The potters of the village are members to two patrilineages. The older, now represented by two active potters who are brothers, claims to have been in the village for nine generations, although detailed genealogical data could only be obtained for four. The second group, now represented by four brothers, came to the village only one generation ago, when their father was invited in because the village then lacked anyone of the right age to produce pottery. Evidence exists for a high degree of mobility in the region, about a quarter of the households in the village having arrived within the last two generations, and this mobility is especially pronounced in the case of artisan castes (compare Gough 1960:26). Given that an approximate ratio may be determined between the demand for pottery and the potter's productive capacity, an optimum num- ber of working potters is required for any given village size, and this number is likely to be small. Since this is an area of high birth rate and high infant mortality, the actual numbers of working potters may fluctuate, and the ac- counts of previous generations tell of rapid changes between a surfeit and a dearth of working potters. A second factor highlighted by this history is the responsibility laid upon the village leaders to ensure the presence of a working potter. When the village lacked a working potter in the previous generation, it was the headman who, after consultation, brought in a potter with a grant of five bigha of land and housing.2 The potters were ideally obligated to supply the district landlord and at least morally obligated to supply the village. In return for this relatively formalized establishment in the village, the potters also received some further rights, known as hak, which are the basis for their claim to precedence over any potter from outside the village. A large variety of alternative relationships probably also obtain between village and potter. Saraswati (1979:56-58) mentions the existence of numbers of villages consisting largely or entirely of working potters, which might permit greater specialization and supply to a large area. Another strategy, an instance of which was recorded in the genealogy of one of the potters, is the importation of husbands against the prevailing virilocal pattern. In this village, which contains thirty castes, the relationships between those</page><page sequence="5">EXCHANGE AND ALIENATION 539 castes involved in the exchange of goods and services relevant to their caste may be formalized through a semicontractual system. The term jajman, which, as Dumont (1972:139) notes, originally referred to the relationship between a priest and patron, is not commonly used here, except for priests. Instead, the term asami is used for the normal contractual arrangements,3 and the term ayath for a still stronger bond. Details will be given of both the fixed and flexible modes by which pottery is distributed. Over fifty kinds of pottery are made in the village, each with its individual (and in many cases alternative) label. For present purposes, the three major wares may be subsumed into two: a ware fired buff in oxidizing conditions and painted in red ochre or white and, secondly, a ware burnished and then fired black in reducing conditions. The first ware tends to comprise what will here be termed ritual vessels, referring not to the intended use but to the context of presentation, and the black vessels will be termed the alternative secular vessels. It is the ritual vessels which are the subject of the fixed mode of exchange. This comprises the provision of certain pots at specified times in the annual cycle. The pivotal points of this distribution are the provision to all asami of prescribed pots at the festivals of divali and akhartij. At akhartij the pots known as the goli, the dhakkan (which is the lid for the goli), and the akhartij gagra are given. At divali clients receive two divali matka, a set of oil lamps, and a miniature vessel called kulhri. There are exceptions, and certain castes may receive a different set of prescribed vessels on both these and other festivals. The supply of these pots is prescribed and does not relate to demand. If a household is still using the pots from the previous year (or six months, as the main pots given on both occasions are water storage pots), it will nevertheless accept the new pots and consign either the new or, more likely, the old pots to storage purposes, to the heap of disused pots, or to a general rubbish heap. The giving of these vessels symbolizes the asami relationship. When asked for a list of his asami, a potter replied, "Wait until after divali; I have to see who will accept my pots." Asami, unlike ayath, are not obliged to take their secular pots from the same potter. The supply of the water pots is subject to only minimal variation. Larger joint families may take double the usual number. In the divali which I observed, only one family in the village was found not to have been supplied: a leather- worker whose household was absent during the distribution and who failed to take steps to obtain them. The potter has more latitude to respond to differ- ences in caste and wealth in the supply of the oil lamps and kulhri. Although everybody agreed that a family ought to receive two kulhri and a handful of oil lamps, a survey of forty households showed a strong association with both wealth and caste, ranging from an average of 4.3 kulhri and 40 oil lamps per household in the wealthiest group, to 1.3 kulhri and 10.8 oil lamps per household in the poorest group. That the supply of oil lamps should be associated so strongly with wealth is</page><page sequence="6">540 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH not surprising, since they are used on the evening of the festival to light up the outside of the house and thereby act as a highly visible marker of prestige. Muslim castes also receive these pots and display oil lamps. A number of these pots are the foci for particular rituals; for example, the pots given at akhartij are anointed with a colored thread and a tilak mark in a ceremony called "the worship of the pottery, " while the kulhri are used in a ceremony which involves boiling milk on the fields. The other fixed supply of vessels is that given for life-cycle ceremonies. Weddings and funerals demand particular and often very large series of vessels, which are specific to the ritual practices of individual castes. Payments for the provision of the festival vessels and for all those services considered part of the asami system are made either once or twice a year at divali and akhartij, which mark the distribution of the proceeds of the two harvests. In the case of a major landowner, the potter might obtain payments at the threshing floor. Often, however, the potter has to wait until a laborer has himself obtained payment before he can receive his due, which may be several weeks after the festival. The scale of payments seems to depend on perceived ability to pay, and those from the laborers seem to average around one-third of those from the major landowners. The smallest payment weighed was two kilograms of sorghum flour. From other service castes, the potter receives reciprocal services rather than grain, obtaining repairs for his wooden and metal objects, supplies of basketry, music, hair cutting, and other services. To have a reliable carpenter as a client, for example, is of great value to the potter. The provision of secular vessels is theoretically outside the asami system. The potters occasionally supply new types of pottery unbidden to their most prestigious clients, in the hope of promoting a new form, but in general the supply of these vessels is regulated by demand. Payment is in cash, though often delayed, and prices are relatively stable through precedent, but subject to haggling. When set against the work involved, the material rewards for the provision of ritual vessels are significantly higher than the cash returns for the supply of secular vessels. In addition to the supply of these vessels within the village, all potters are involved to some extent in the selling of pottery through outside markets, and potters may also travel around the nearby villages, selling pottery carried by donkey. Pots sold outside their recognized "domain" (which includes the local market) should all be secular vessels. Both these forms of marketing reflect the surplus production potential of six potters, given a village of this size. A generation earlier, when the single active potter was only able to produce the ritual vessels required by the village, the villagers had themselves purchased their secular vessels at an outside market. A variety of obligations, other than the provision of pottery, have accrued to the potters and the female painters, although they are mainly obvious ex- tensions of those roles. Potters aid in serving meals at social functions; they help arrange prayers and often anoint those who attend with the tilak mark.</page><page sequence="7">EXCHANGE AND ALIENATION 541 They may draw water for important households either at festivals or on longer- term contracts. They are second only to the musicians' caste as the players of instruments accompanying religious songs. They may present an auspicious vessel (the kalash) to an honored guest. They also have special duties at festivals related to Shitala Mata (the goddess of smallpox) or the elephant- headed god, Ganesh, with whom the potters are particularly associated. The status of the kumhar (potters' caste) varies; in some areas the association with the donkey and its dung (used in pottery manufacture) becomes a marker for a lower ranking (Saraswati 1979:47-50), but these factors are not considered significant in this village. The client in the kind of relationship so far described is termed asami. Individual potters were involved with between thirteen and seventy-one asami. Only a small proportion of these could also be termed ayath, which generally refers to a stronger bond in which the client is obliged to take secular vessels from the same potter, in an arrangement which should ideally last over several generations. The maximum number of ayath claimed by a potter was twenty- three. The potters enthused about their ayath; one noted, "If an ayath breaks a kunda today, we will supply him with a new one tomorrow; if we take them a myna in the morning and they want another in the evening, we will bring it to their doorstep." In effect, the ayath relationship is an extension of the same principles which bind the asami. Changes in asami relationships occur quite slowly. Only three clear cases of a change in association were noted during the year between the two periods of fieldwork. Twelve of the thirteen households asked were found to have a potter of the same lineage as in the previous generation. Villagers avoid overt conflict and will not openly inform the potter that they are changing, but merely note that another potter has already supplied them. Equally, a potter dissatisfied with payments may simply not supply vessels on the next customary occasion. Although the reason given for changes is entirely economic (i.e., disputes over payments), a more subtle basis for change may be deduced from analysis. One potter tends to be known as the "jat potter," even though he does not, in fact, have the largest number of jat asami. In effect the association refers to the factionalism that may be found here, as in most similar Indian villages, and for which the jat have a particular reputation (Pettigrew 1975; Pradhan 1967). To be known as the "jat potter" is to be associated with the dominant group within the jat, which is, at present, associated in turn with the dominant Congress party and certain "liberal" attitudes towards untouchability and other such issues. The same potter appeared to be expanding his number of asami within that group. This general political stance was dominant in the village, and all potters but one were Congress supporters. From general discussion, I obtained information on the assumed political affiliation of most of the house- holds in the village, and two-thirds of the asami of the one potter who supported the nationalist wing of the Janata party shared that political allegiance, the highest proportion for any potter. Therefore, although change is slow, a gradual coherence appears to be emerging between the major factional leanings of the</page><page sequence="8">542 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH households and the service castes with which they associate. Any morphological or decorative attribute which discriminates between these potters and painters would therefore be loosely symbolic of these social divisions. Disputes were especially strong over asami in other villages. In 1981 the potters claimed a total of 59 asami outside of the village. If these are added to the 259 households of the village, we obtain an average of 53 clients per potter. This is comparable to the evidence from the survey of Surat by Bose (1980), which gives an average of 51 clients per potter. INTERPRETATION Although the term jajmani is not used in the Malwa case, it is useful to have a single conventional label for systems of embedded exchange in South Asian villages, if only to assert that they are comparable and require some general approach. The term should not, however, be used to obscure the great variety of such systems and their often diverse specific relationships with economic, political, and other factors, which will be addressed below. The most simplistic accounts of the jajmani system are those of the type referred to earlier, which relegate this intravillage system to a chapter on economics. Although pottery is used for instrumental purposes and distributed accordingly, it seems that it is considered part of the asami system precisely because of the degree to which it uses modes of distribution which are not directly instrumental. The asami system results in an overproduction of pottery, in relation to needs, and an overpayment, compared to other contexts. In most other accounts of the jajmani system, although the service may be to a large extent instrumental, as in the case of a carpenter repairing agricultural instruments, it is usually that aspect of the service which may be rendered in a formal fixed mode which is presented in relation to the category jajmani. Many of the major services, provided by musicians, priests, and mendicants, or secondary services, for example, at weddings, by washermen, and barbers, can hardly be regarded as instrumental in the colloquial sense of economic "need." Although Beidelman (1959) and some others claim otherwise, most accounts based upon direct observation agree that the relationships of the kind discussed here do not subsume the various forms of agricultural labor contracts and coercive labor schemes to be found in villages. Thus, although the system may take the form of the distribution and exchange of services, it cannot be reduced to assump- tions about what is instrumental and is greatly traduced by being considered as solely an "economic" phenomenon. The second common assumption is that the system is produced by the dominance of the major landlords and is ultimately based on landownership. The potter supplies all households in the village, whatever their caste or income. When I first discovered the ayath system, I thought that perhaps this bond, with its stronger obligations, might represent the clear link to landown- ership which was absent in the ordinary asami relationship. Evidence does exist for some association with wealth. The average landholding for ayath is</page><page sequence="9">EXCHANGE AND ALIENATION 543 52 bigha, compared to 44.3 for asami. However, many ayath are low caste. One potter has three households of weavers and three of washermen, not necessarily the wealthiest of their caste, and also a landless, laboring paint- maker and a landless tailor. Another potter has two washermen with 8 and 10 bigha, respectively, while his richest client is not an ayath. Ayath is significant in understanding the jajmani system, but not primarily as a landlord-service relationship. A portrayal of this system as pivoted around the landlord is clearly not compatible with Wiser's (1936) original representation, in which most castes served either the whole village or all Hindu castes, but it has been very common since (e.g., Beidelman 1959; Kolenda 1963:11; Opler and Singh 1948:495; Orenstein 1962:302; and, most surprisingly, Dumont 1972:148). The case of the potters supports Gould (1967:40), who sees the identification of the system with service to landlords as "one of the most persistent over-simplifications which students of Indian society have perpetrated over the years." Moving towards my own interpretation, it would appear that the separation of the provision of ritual and secular vessels emphasizes a division between a fixed and a more flexible system of exchange. The fixed system is surrounded by ritual and fixity of time, place, and substance and seems orientated towards a network suffused with elements which ground it within a set of social ideals related to the proper relationship between individuals and society. This in turn suggests that the formalized elements are similar to those implied by another term used for exchange relationships, that of "embedded." As a first step, these ideals may be linked to the concept of jati dharma, as elucidated at a recent conference on the concept of duty in South Asia (O'Flaherty and Derrett 1978). A common observation seemed to be that the Western concept of duty emphasizes the external pressure which society brings to bear on the individual to perform certain actions that he or she might otherwise be inclined to ignore. The concept of dharma, by contrast, emphasizes the natural inclination of the individual to perform those actions which are intrinsic to one's birth, and there- fore character, but which might not be followed because of the influence of society. Jati dharma is then the dharma appropriate to the jati or caste. Through the asami system, the members of the potter's household are able to perform their dharma in accordance with their "natural" inclination, which derives from their birth as members of this caste. The potters' relationship with other castes, then, takes a form which represents their work as ritual activities from which merit will accrue to both giver and receiver. These re- lations work within the nexus of exchange in kind, rather than abstract cash, and through fixed, formal obligation, rather than ad hoc utility. In return, the potters' service to the village is recognized in hak, which are their rights to supply the village in preference to any external potters. A case was recorded of a potter in another village who no longer manufactured pottery, but who purchased the ritual vessels from an active potter and then distributed these to his asami in the normal fashion. This implies an unusually close relationship between the concept of person and action. This point has commonly been made</page><page sequence="10">544 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH with respect to South Asian social organization, notably in Marriott's (1976) discussions of the nonduality of substance and being. An analysis of this kind, which proceeds through the explicit and normative concepts embraced by classical terminology, may, however, prove limiting in dealing with such diverse phenomena as jajmani. Later, it will be argued that these actions may be characterized in other ways which are more compatible with the variability in observed practices. THE IMPLICATIONS OF MONEY By using the concept of fixed embedded exchange as the definition and essential element of the jajmani system (i.e., that which distinguishes it from the ordinary exchange of services in peasant villages elsewhere), several com- mon alternative approaches can be reexamined. The first of these is that the jajmani system is a traditional mode of village exchange which is currently under attack from modernization (e.g., Gough 1960:33; Kolenda 1978:52-54; Lewis and Barnouw 1967:133). All current anthropological enquiries are con- ducted under conditions which include elements of those transformations termed modernization, but this has been assumed to be the key element in some accounts. Somewhat simplified, this argument is that the jajmani system is undermined by the spread of the cash economy and that the relationship be- tween the two is invariably antagonistic. Such a conception is probably inseparable from those general analyses which attempt to interpret modernization by posing evolutionary, and usually dualistic, models of exchange relations. Such analyses are often influenced by the works of Marx, Mauss, Polanyi, and Weber. These authors vary considerably in their specific content, but all tend towards a dichotomous approach, opposing, for example, capitalist against precapitalist and substantivist against formalist eco- nomic forms and so forth. Such distinctions are often posed as polarities, and in general the abstracted flexible systems are seen as replacing the formal embedded systems in history. The manner in which change has been inter- preted in South Asian village ethnographies may in part stem from the expec- tations thereby raised. Although jajmani may be interpreted partly in terms of the traditions rep- resented by some of these authors, this particular incorporation may be mis- applied. The exchange of pottery for cash through the market need not be opposed to the asami system as a more "rational" modern system replacing a more traditional embedded system. On the contrary, the market may be under- stood as assisting in the maintenance of the jajmani system. This is because a whole series of constraints are placed upon the practice of these idealized relationships. Pots break at times other than just before festivals, the demands of households vary with their size, and the village may not, at a given time, have an active working potter. In all these cases, it is essential for relationships to exist which are more flexible than the asami system and which can accom- modate to such factors as supply-demand and instrumentality. Furthermore, while embedded exchanges always imply the direct embodiment of social being,</page><page sequence="11">EXCHANGE AND ALIENATION 545 and thereby social relations, in their transaction, a demand may exist for an arena of free monetary exchange. By being relatively abstracted, such an arena is unconstrained by social considerations and influences social relations only in the less direct mode of differential wealth. In this context, the market system can be seen to provide the necessary flexibility required and thus to help preserve an embedded system from the challenge of utility (compare Bloch 1977). The two modes are, then, complementary and not opposed, since the potter has the dual responsibility to work in the arena of both the ideal and the practical. I do not wish to imply that this is a necessary or even a common relationship. Money, understood as abstract flexible exchange, is intrinsically opposed to formalized and fixed forms of exchange.4 Simmel's (1978) brilliant analysis showed how money as abstracted exchange, when allowed to realize its own potential and to thereby break down formal exchange, acts both theoretically and actually to transform social relations through processes which simultane- ously create new forms of freedom and alienation. In many instances of mod- ernization, the arrival of abstract money from elsewhere may create a sometimes violent rupture, as shown, for example, in Taussig's (1977) analysis of the reification of cash as evil by Columbian peasants. Its effects may be partially ameliorated through the kind of framing and ritualizing procedure recently analyzed by Toren (n.d.) as the taming of cash in Fiji. In the Indian case, however, a much longer development is suggested, in which, on the one hand, the dualistic tendency which places formalized embed- ded exchange against abstract cash, or relatively abstract noncash marketing, is emphasized by their separation into distinct spheres. But this same devel- opment transforms the monetary economy into a supportive, rather than a destructive, element of embedded exchange relations. In short, with respect to Simmel's analysis, the effect is to obtain many of the advantages of a free market, while avoiding some of its more unpalatable consequences. For the potters the cash nexus is indeed allowed the full freedom of ab- stracted commercial exchange, but within its own sphere. Although a typical middle caste, the potters are masterful manipulators of rationalized monetary exchange. When their income and expenditure were calculated, it quickly be- came apparent that they were manipulating a variety of land-use rights, various levels of interest payments, forms of pawnbroking, and the use of relatives for the purchase and sale of abstract commodities in a fashion which would have been the envy of many a more acknowledged entrepreneur. A calculation of their annual income has to incorporate expectations about the possible suc- cess of complex investments and borrowings. All of this is carried out simul- taneously with the highly formalized exchange relationships previously described. Socially embedded exchange is here defined in relation to calculative market exchange, not to oppose them nor to order them within an evolutionary context, but rather to ensure that they are mutually supportive. The polarity is under- stood here as a specific cultural practice rather than an instance of the an- thropological dichotomy of "gift" and "commodity."</page><page sequence="12">546 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH The problem is to determine the origins of such activities. Coinage itself is of considerable antiquity in this area. The local town of Ujjain was an important mint two millennia ago, and archaeological excavations have shown that coinage was in wide circulation in Malwa at that period (Jain 1972:143-48, 226-28). At the same time literary and epigraphic sources indicate that the towns con- tained financial services of great sophistication (Saletore 1975:600-654). Ad- jacent to the potters' village lies a mound which represents a comparable settlement occupied over several millennia. Present-day erosion and archae- ological excavation have revealed large quantities of coinage for such a small site. In many other ethnographic and historical cases, evidence of coinage cannot be equated with free circulation, but rather with hoarding and the transformation of coinage into ornament or into much more restricted media of exchange (see, e.g., Douglas 1967). Such historical evidence as is available for South Asia is suggestive, however, of full monetary development, with money being closely involved in commodity production even at the level of the village peasantry (see Perlin 1978 and 1983 for an argument against what he terms the sub- stantivist view). One possible scenario for the development of the kind of relationship evident today is an expansion of monetization in the seventeenth century. This was the period of expansion into textile markets in Europe and elsewhere (see, e.g., Mukerji 1983:166-209) and therefore may have also seen the spread of rural protoindustrialization, akin to the later European verlag system of "putting-out." Such a system would have been favored by the division of the work force by caste, which left it open to exploitation and control by merchants and middlemen (Chaudhuri 1978:256; Perlin 1983:58; Raychaudhuri 1983:281-82).6 This is also the period when references are available to the jajmani and the more village-oriented baluta systems (Fukazawah 1983:251- 52; Raychaudhuri 1983:279-80). Historians have noted that "there is nothing to indicate that the traditional system was dissolving through the operation of the market forces" (Raychaudhuri 1983:280). Rather than being under threat, it may be that these embedded systems were in fact coming into being at this time in complementarity with monetary capital and exchange. This impression may, however, be an artifact of the increased availability of historical sources for this period; and the fixed system of exchange, the development of a rural and small-town-based "verlag" production, and monetization of the peasantry (which declined substantially under colonialism, Perlin 1983:78-79) may all go back to much earlier periods, which also saw the development of the caste system itself in its modem, more rigid form. The relationships represented by the jajmani system are not static. Many of the caste-related services have been ousted by technological change, and what was once complementary may have recently been subject to the much greater pressure of modern capitalism in traumatic transformations of local economic and social relations. Such transformations are not comparable with the situation analyzed in this paper but are closer to anthropological analyses of plantation-based colonial development and its consequences.</page><page sequence="13">EXCHANGE AND ALIENATION 547 SECONDARY ARTICULATION OF THE JAJMANI SYSTEM The relationship between the embedded and disembedded exchange systems may in this instance be characterized as that between an ideal system and its contextual articulation or, alternatively, between a structure and the circum- stance of its realization. It is not just that cash provides flexibility and protection for a fixed system of exchange, but, at a higher level, the circumscription of cash exchange within particular contexts acts to encompass market transactions within the more general symbolic structures of caste society. This perspective may provide a basis for the examination of another series of approaches which seek to interpret or even reject the concept of jajmani by emphasizing one of a series of contextual relationships. Epstein (1967) attempts to interpret jajmani in relation to economic needs as a kind of "game theory" process (see also Lewis 1958:57), but the fact that a set of fixed payments enables a farmer to recoup on a good harvest what he has lost in a bad year can more appropriately be seen as a secondary effect rather than as a functionalist cause. Her own evidence shows that the Wangala blacksmith was only able to enter ordinary cash exchange relations for the servicing of a new kind of plough when he had ensured that another blacksmith was prepared to take on the traditional ex- change of services for fixed rewards. A similar problem is found with the various attempts to analyze jajmani as a system of exploitation. The rules of embedded exchange are always open to strategy, and the attempts by clients to refuse to pay or by service castes to effectively go on strike indicate the struggles which have no doubt been ac- centuated with the disruptions posed by modern inventions. Many such ex- amples are documented (e.g., Beidelman 1959:51-64; Lewis and Barnouw 1967; and see also a fictional account in Anand 1959). The jajmani system is likely to be as hierarchical as caste and as exploitative as the differential access to power, but this does not in itself explain its specificity as a system in comparison with peasant villages elsewhere. In the case of the potters, pay- ments may have been low, but they were better for those services carried out within the system than outside it (as also found by Orenstein 1962). This would again suggest that it is the context (for example, the articulation with class relations) rather than the degree of formalism per se which is exploitative, except in so far as the contract as ritual serves as a mystification of power relations. An influential analysis by Pocock in 1962 attempted to discriminate "ritual" services, such as those of the mendicant and priest, from more "instrumental" services and other contracts, a point which Parry (1979:58-73) has attempted to refine. It is true that different kinds of arrangements may be distinguished locally, but in a sense this is an articulation with the specific expectations of caste and the type of services, whose formalization as exchange will take different forms. A Brahmin, for example, may be expected to obtain more rights over his clients compared to obligations, than is a sweeper. Most in- tercaste relations include formal arrangements of both "instrumental" and "rit-</page><page sequence="14">548 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH ual" services, and although some differences may be accounted for by the articulation of the system with the structure of caste, this may not be a strong base from which to try to understand the system itself. That an emphasis on such dimensions of variability may lead to a more general relativism with respect to the nature of jajmani is shown in the recent analysis of a Tamil case by Good (1982). Good opposes the use of the term jajmani in areas where it is not used locally. His own analysis distinguishes between different aspects of the payments made for services: one for the labor involved and the other "in recognition of the special characteristics by virtue of which the expert is able to fulfill his function" (Good 1982:25). On the face of it, his example is quite dissimilar from that of the potters, where it is fixity in services, rather than payments, which is stressed.6 More importantly, Good provides a clear example of the complementarity between the fixed and flexible aspects of the exchange relationship. He criti- cizes David (1977) for attempting to differentiate caste from caste along such a division and points out that these are elements usually found within a given caste's exchange relationships.' His formal aspect (for which the local term is sastiram) appears, however, remarkably close to the conventional idea of jati dharma. It stresses intrinsic ability as a caste member and also intrinsic duty, for example, to attend certain ceremonies, although it is not identical to jati dharma since it includes intracaste expectations. Good is able to elucidate a number of particular local features, but this is mainly by stressing articulation through local kin relations. In such approaches, the greater the variability between cases in an area (for example, in the survey by Bronger 1975), the less feasible will general analysis become; whereas the present approach pre- dicts that in its forms of articulation the system will be just as variable as its contexts. A final example of the use of secondary articulation to create alternative interpretations derives from writers who have stressed the political aspects of the jajmani system (e.g., Fuller 1978; Hocart 1950). They suggest that it represents merely a truncated and partly imitative form of a set of relationships which at one time stretched all the way up to the ruler, but which were cut off from these higher links through the destruction of that political framework. This "top down" model is clearly very different in emphasis from the kind of "bottom up" model being proposed here, where the ideals arise out of village practice. In his account of recent north Indian history, Bayly (1983) appears to favor a bottom up interpretation. He states that "emerging classes and dominions were most secure when they adjusted themselves to the theories of 'sharing' and redistribution which were prevalent amongst the mass of the Hindu and Muslim population" (Bayly 1983:51) and that "even kingdoms with a formally Islamic constitution can be seen as extended sets of jajmani relations" (Bayly 1983:50). In the potters' case, the argument for the settlement of a new potter was that he would serve the landlord. Since this individual owned twenty-seven other such villages, he hardly needed the services of that par- ticular potter to produce objects he would rarely, if ever, use. What is illustrated</page><page sequence="15">EXCHANGE AND ALIENATION 549 here is the use of these ideals to legitimize an actual obligation which is clearly to the village as a whole and which is comparable to the baluta system (Or- enstein 1962). In short, there is a dynarmic relationship, involving the appro- priation of legitimatory concepts, flowing in both directions between the jajmani system and the political sphere. This relationship may differ locally, but, once again, the articulation with politics may not be the appropriate source for the interpretation of jajmani. In no case can an individual example be fully understood without an inves- tigation of all these familiar lines of cleavage and bonding. They are all essential components of the particular cases being analyzed. Many additional features have been recorded: Gould (1958), for example, notes the interplay between caste and kinship relations, Harper (1959) the much looser relations operating in a context in which cash crops rather than subsistence crops dominate, while Kolenda (1963) considers a number of other such points of articulation with factionalism and patronage. Such analyses, for all their diversity, do not nec- essarily amount to an argument for particularism. What is required is a general model of tendencies towards fixity in exchange, a model which can address the historical specificity and therefore also the variability of the observed forms. THE PROBLEM OF ALIENATION IN EXCHANGE Once the comparability of examples from many areas of South Asia has been reestablished, a final stage may be attempted in which this particular phenom- enon is interpreted at the level of more general anthropological theory and is thereby related to comparable cases elsewhere. The model for the argument which follows is derived from a paper by Nancy Munn (1977) on the entry of Gawa canoes into the Kula ring, but it relates to wider issues about the nature of alienation as related to exchange, for which the best known discussant is Mauss (1954). The most common conception of alienation is derived from the early writings of Marx and his contention that under capitalism there occurs a threefold separation: that of the worker from the product of labor, that of labor from the activity of production, and the estrangement of people from nature through the institution of private property (Marx 1975:322-34; see also Oilman 1971). These assertions rest on the essential ontological proposition that it is the direct transformation of nature in production which provides the basis for the creation of social being through objectification in the Hegelian sense (Miller 1987). Now if it is argued that in a noncapitalist society these conditions do not hold, or are at least muted, then it follows that this same process of production may be achieved in nonalienating conditions, with the result that the producer stands in a more natural relationship of mutual constitution to the product of labor. If the term "production" is broadened to include the perfor- mance of services between people, as well as the creation of concrete objects, and given as its context the kind of division of labor familiar from a peasant village, then jati dharma, as it relates to ideal and specific occupation, may be</page><page sequence="16">550 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH understood as a comparable expression of a similar ideal, the identification of person and action, although even a person not engaged in their named caste service may still attempt such an identification through the jajmani system. The focus of concern with alienation may then switch to the area of circu- lation, since it is at this point that the producer is parted from this same product (although property relations may also intrude here). It follows that exchange is intrinsically a potentially alienating activity; paradoxically, the less problematic the act of production, the more problematic the subsequent separation of producer from product in the act of exchange. It is this dilemma which Munn (1977) addresses in her discussion of the Gawa canoes. A study of manufacture and canoe decoration illustrates how the canoes are invested, through anthro- pomorphic symbolism, with images of the transformation of social relations connected with their manufacture as an object form. Through the symbolism of movement, these decorations also preempt the next stage, in which the canoe is "launched" into the Kula system. This act of separation is acknowledged in the efforts expended on the reincorporation of those objects which are exchanged for the canoes, to ensure that all these "conversions" return to the owning clan, such that this new identification is used to counter the potential alienation arising from the initial separation. A series of recent papers on the Kula (e.g., in Leach and Leach 1983) document the articulation between various modes and objects of exchange. A paper by Damon (1980) goes one stage further by emphasizing the manner by which certain objects, termed kitoum, are related to their producers as "con- gealed labor" and thereby remain inalienable, despite the physical separation in circulation. Whatever the status of the objects, the analysis rests upon the extent to which the people taking part are alienated through the process of exchange from the products of their social labor (Damon 1982; Gregory 1982). These discussions, as also the present paper, serve to separate the spheres of production and distribution in a manner which may not be compatible with analyses based upon the later writings of Marx (e.g., 1973:88-98). The jajmani system may be understood as the manner in which the peasant villagers of India, living under the caste system and frequently relatively self- sufficient in their organization of basic services, confront the problem of alien- ation posed in the exchange of these services, a problem which derives from the pronounced division of labor, on the one hand, and the use of money, on the other. The advantages of both of these are evident: the division of labor allows for a more sophisticated and specialized range of services, while abstract cash represents great flexibility as a medium of exchange and a distancing from the constraints of conventional social relations. Though advantageous, both are intrinsically alienating. The division of labor separates the individual as a social functionary often representing a fragmented part of some conceptual social whole. In this case, jajmani may be seen as one of a whole series of relationships constructed between fragmented parts and a conception of ultimate unity, relationships which are familiar from Hindu philosophy and Dumont's (1972) anthropology.</page><page sequence="17">EXCHANGE AND ALIENATION 551 The jajmani system serves to counter these alienating properties by for- malizing dyadic relations between households (or between households and the village) in terms of their use of services and by placing the money economy in a reciprocal relationship with the formalized processes of exchange, such that the delineation of separate spheres transforms a threat into a support. As in the case of Munn's canoes, the objects involved in the exchange relationship may themselves be subject to certain acts of reincorporation which serve to emphasize the embedded nature of the exchange process. In the case of the pottery, all examples of the red painted pots (the ware used in jajmani ex- changes) are, on receipt, subject to rituals in which they may undergo either anthropomorphic or theomorphic transformations (Miller 1985:145). The black ware, which is received through cash purchase, is never the subject of such rituals. In a manner parallel to those documented by Munn, these rites may then serve as rituals of reincorporation for the objects of embedded exchange. By this stage, a normative and articulated concept such as jati dharma can be ignored in the analysis, since it can no more deal with the actual variety of observed practices than the older anthropological use of the term jajmani. Rather, the interpretation is based upon the evidence at the village level of the sheer prevalence of these diverse combinations of embedded and disem- bedded systems of exchange. Both Indian villagers and Melanesian islanders may be understood as engaged in a form of praxis, that is, the working out of philosophy through practical action rather than through theoretical concepts. Both may be interpreted as attempting partial and historically specific solutions to what is finally a universal problem of human ontology, but both develop quite individual systems in terms of their own social organization, division of labor, *nd degree of hierarchy. The emphasis here is somewhat different from the classic analysis of Mauss (1954), which provides the foundation for any such comparative analysis of the relationship between exchange and alienation. Mauss and, following him, Sah- lins (1974, Chapter 4) are attempting a more ambitious scheme, in which exchange is analyzed as a precondition for society itself. In this paper, by contrast, a particular form of South Asian social organization, that of caste, is taken as the "given," though dynamic, context for the development of the jajmani system, perhaps over millennia. The "reciprocity" of formal exchange is in no sense egalitarian. Indeed in the case of jajmani, exchange reproduces social asymmetry, while in the Kula it is increasingly being seen as creating it (Munn 1983; Weiner 1983). In a sense, the special nature of the jajmani system means that it is most directly exploitative precisely because of the existence of major social groups outside it. The contracts of most agricultural laborers are conceptually and actually outside of jajmani because they are mainly members of castes which are not related to agricultural labor as an intrinsic part of their being. Indeed they most often carry out this work because their own caste work is not available or sufficient. The extent to which untouchables are included in the fixed exchange system seems highly variable in the literature.</page><page sequence="18">552 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH The effects of the jajmani system are always contingent upon the relations! of power within which it is exercised, and alienation may be consequent upon many other aspects of social practice (e.g., untouchability) besides those ad- dressed here. The process of formalization is always also a process of con- straint, which dominant interests can use both as a direct means and as legitimation for the preservation of power asymmetry. Many of the examples quoted by Beidelman (1959) and others clearly demonstrate the effect of the jajmani system as exploitation. However, it may be that the effectiveness of jajmani in this regard derives in part from the fact that the principles upon which it is based are not of themselves exploitative, but, rather, advantageous, to all sections of the community. Jajmani is then an ideology (Miller and Tilley 1984), in which villagers act according to a representation of society which appears to derive from their own interests, but which, when set into its historical context, tends towards the reproduction of the interests of dominant groups. It is also possible for the jajmani system itself to be alienating under certain conditions. In cases when a caste, attempting to raise its status, becomes distanced from the normal expectations of its group, for example when the ordinary kumhar (potter) aspires to be seen as prajapati (the creator), then disaffection from one's given social position might result in the formalized obligations of jajmani becoming merely constraints without the implications of identification. Equally, in the contemporary setting, when the philosophical and ideological foundations of caste are under question, a more general problem of legitimation arises which may lead again to the embedded system being transformed into a hindrance to group development. The jajmani system, as portrayed here, cannot be characterized by a list of expected and fixed traits. It must be understood rather as a historical tendency towards formalization, and as such it should be understood as a gradation, whose actual degree of fixity responds to the local conditions. This tendency and its possible cyclical pattern are evident in the asami-ayath distinction. Since there is an ideal number of potters per village and this is few, and given the high infant mortality and late age at which potters learn their trade (since every trained potter is a potential rival), then, despite high mobility, at any given time a number of villages are likely to be without potters. The asami-ayath distinction is one of degree. When potters are scarce, secular pottery will be purchased at the market and ritual pots supplied by a potter in another village under a minimal asami contract. When, as now, the village is comparatively potter rich, the ever-present tendency towards fixity is extended such that all pottery becomes subsumed within the maximal ayath contracts compatible with pragmatic constraints. It would follow that particular areas may well experience strong short-term shifts moving either towards disintegration of jajmani or towards the reestablishment of a system more consistent with the model outlined here. In conclusion the jajmani system is to be interpreted in terms of universalist tendencies, but only as realized in historically specific forms generated at the most local level. Although compared here to the Kula, these are two extremely</page><page sequence="19">EXCHANGE AND ALIENATION 553 different practices, with jajmani being generated in the context of the whole series of articulations which were discussed above. It is possible, therefore, to relate this model to the highly varied forms in which it is found. This variety arises out of the diversity of local conditions and the different outcomes of local strategy, the local trajectory of social change, the dynamics of interest, and the relationship between representation and action in local ideology. Thus whether or not the term jajmani itself is employed, a widespread phenomenon exists which requires some general and theoretical account which neither ex- cludes nor renders inconsequential the specificity of the individual example.

This was legitimated as land granted in exchange for services to the landlord, who owned twenty-eight such villages. 3. The term asami as used in this context does not seem to imply tenancy or have any pejorative connotation, unlike its use in some areas. 4. This is despite the fact that cash may be used in fixed exchange when it forms part of the embedded system. 5. A "verlag" system is one in which the artisans usually work from their own home, copying samples and using materials supplied on credit by the merchant or middleman (Kriedte, Medick, and Schlumbohm 1981:101-7). In South Asia separate castes may represent minor divisions in the work process which are "put out" to them in turn. Such a system has shown resilience compared to the modem factory system (see, e.g., Swallow 1982; Miess 1982) and is prominent in the surveys of crafts carried out in the 1961 census of India and at the turn of the century (see, e.g., Edwardes et al. 1976). Although most accounts seem to assume this system had begun just before the period which they are documenting, it may well precede colonial contact (Gopal 1975:229-37; Perlin 1983) and may in part account for early Indian success in exporting textiles. 6. In part this may be a regional division, since examples from the south (such as David 1977:196; Good 1982; or Gough 1960) tend to stress fixity in payments, while examples from the north (such as the potters; or Mayer 1960:67-74 and Orenstein 1962:303-5) tend to stress fixity in services. 7. David (1977:199-207) employs the terms "bounded" and "nonbounded" for the two modes of exchange and suggests that they relate to two different normative codes of action, the former employing a hierarchical amity and the latter a nonhierchical instrumentality.
