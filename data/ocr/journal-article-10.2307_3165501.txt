<plain_text><page sequence="1">George Abbot: "The Wanted Archbishop" S. M. HOLLAND Historians and biographers of George Abbot traditionally have viewed King James's appointment of the forty-eight year old bishop of London to the archbishopric of Canterbury on 4 March 1611 as both unexpected and unpopular. Although Fuller conceived him to be "of a more fatherly presence than those who might have been his fathers for age in the Church of England," there was a significant body of opinion that held he was unfit for such an important post for two major reasons. The first was that he had never been an incumbent of any living with cure of souls, but was "mounted from a lecturer to a dignitary."' His lack of familiarity with the problems of the parish clergy would, it was felt, prevent him from sympathizing with them and improving their lot. The second argument against his fitness for the primacy was the widespread assumption that he would be too sympathetic to the Puritans. Heylin, for instance, asserted that "some of the bishops and other great men of the court," consulting about whom they should recom- mend to King James as Bancroft's successor, dismissed both Abbot and another contender, James Montague (bishop of Bath and Wells), as being "extremely popular and such as would ingratiate themselves with the Puritan faction, how dearly soever the Church paid for it."2 They resolved on the eloquent bishop of Ely, Lancelot Andrewes, as the most suitable choice and were taken aback when the "outsider" candidate Abbot was chosen. Their surprise had been shared by later historians and the general consensus has been that he had crept in holding onto the skirts of his patron Dunbar. The aim of this article is to show that, far from being "The Unwanted Archbishop" of Welsby's title,3 an earlier biographer was much nearer the truth when he wrote that "King James himself thought of Abbot."4 In fact not only was George Abbot's appointment very much a conscious choice by the king, it was also, more significantly, what his predecessor as archbishop, Richard Bancroft, both expected and desired. The death of Richard Bancroft (archbishop of Canterbury from 1604- 1610), has often been seen as a watershed which marked a final break with 1. Thomas Fuller, Worthies, 2 vols.

Many would agree with Dr. Tyacke's assertion that "the archiepiscopal predecessor whom Abbot least resembled was the man he immediately succeeded."5 Bancroft was seen as a High Churchman with a loathing of Puritanism, and Abbot as a hard-line Calvinist and persecutor of Roman Catholics. Yet this distinction is too stark, for Bancroft and Abbot had more in common than appears at first sight. Bancroft was virtually a quarter of a century older than Abbot and very much an Elizabethan. He had worked closely with Whitgift throughout his archiepiscopate and became increasingly his right-hand man-especially important in the High Commission-during the ailing primate's final years. The archbishop had entrusted to Bancroft the task of tracking down the press responsible for the printing of the Martin Marprelate tracts, which lampooned the bishops. In Bancroft's famous Saint Paul's Cross sermon of 9 February 1589, in which he took as his text "Many false prophets have gone out into the world," he attacked all separatists and schismatics, while defending the episcopal order of government.6 For, like Whitgift, he saw the Puritans as the greatest threat to the still fledgling Church of England. But for Abbot, who was confronted in the opening decades of the seventeenth century with the rise of "Arminianism" at home while the Counter- Reformation was taking hold on the Continent, it seemed that the battle against popery was the most essential objective. In fact, if Abbot is to be believed, by the end of his life Bancroft was becoming increasingly alarmed by the popish tendencies of certain men of position within the Church of England, notably Howson, Buckeridge and Carier. His suspicions were confirmed in the case of the latter by his flight abroad and conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1613.7 Abbot shared fully his predecessor's horror and distrust of separatism and, whatever his private theological opinions, his public policy was based on a determination to maintain uniformity and good order in the Church. A further similarity with Bancroft was his acceptance of King James's view that for the sake of peace in the Church, matters such as predestination and election should not be made matters of public dispute, but restricted to the universities.8 George Abbot, like Bancroft, was a doughty defender of episcopacy as was shown by his efforts to reestablish it in Scotland prior to his accession to Canterbury. It was the strength of his conviction that enabled him to show the 5.

He sought to mollify the fears of the Scottish opponents of episcopacy by persuading them "that there were no substantial differences in religion betwixt the two realms, but only in things indifferent concerning government and ceremonies."9 Not only did he feel that bishops had an essential role as superintending pastors, he may also have had some sympathy for Bancroft's "iure divino" view of episcopacy. This possible sympathy is indicated by the fact that when Francis Mason published a spirited defense of the divine right episcopacy in his work "Of the consecration of the bishops of the Church of England," he not only dedicated it to Abbot (then archbishop of Canterbury), but added the significant comment that "I proceeded in this argument with your Grace's fatherly direction and encouragement."'0 Above all, Abbot believed in order and due respect for authority: he was constantly in attendance in the High Commission Court, seeking to enforce conformity in the church and he never regarded ceremonies as matters that could be left to the private conscience either to accept or reject. On 8 July 1633, in one of the last public acts of his life, Abbot bade the parishioners of Crayford, Kent, receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper kneeling on the "the two ascents, or foot paces in the chancel before the communion table."" Moreover, he was prepared enthusiastically to execute royal orders on nonconformity: witness a series of letters to Thomas Dove (bishop of Peterborough) upbraiding him for allowing various silenced ministers, such as John Dod, to preach in his diocese.l2 A comparison of the visitation articles of Bancroft (1609) and Abbot (1613) shows no appreciable differences. The articles concerning reverent behavior in church are to the same effect in both cases, but Abbot goes into far greater detail, exactly following the 1604 Canons, enjoining "devoutly kneeling when the general confession of sins, litany, the ten commandments and all prayers and collects are read and using all due and lowly reverence when the blessed name of the Lord Jesus Christ is mentioned."'3 Also, he sought to know whether any parishioners, having a preacher as their parson, absented themselves regularly from his sermons and resorted to other places to hear different preachers, since this absence was 9.

In 1611 Abbot warned Thomas Dove to keep a close eye on a partial conformist, Mr. Cataline, who was more peaceable than he had been previously but still allowed excommunicants from other parishes to attend his church.'4 Abbot disliked "the tradition of itinerating," whether of preachers or congregations, as he showed in his "Exposition upon the prophet Jonah." "Ours is a stable profession," he asserted. "It is no gadding ministry: mark that."'5 Having suggested that the two archbishops had more in common than has often been believed, it remains to trace the course of their actual relationship. This outline is particularly necessary in order to realize how it was that Bancroft came to see the man whom many have accused of undoing all his predecessor's work as his natural successor. The start of the relationship was not auspicious. In Cheapside stood a cross set up by Edward I in 1290 to mark the stages of his journey to Westminster with the body of Queen Eleanor. It had been partly demolished by the citizens of London in 1581 and in 1600 Richard Bancroft (bishop of London, 1597-1604) wished to have it rebuilt. In this wish he was supported by the Queen and Council, but the citizens appealed to the divines of the universities for their opinion on whether the cross should stand or be demolished. George Abbot, at that time dean of Winchester and also Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, replied in a letter, approved by five heads of colleges, that it should not be retained lest "many evil afflicted men do make their advantage from hence to insinuate into the minds of their credulous hearers, that it is a token of the return of their faith again into this land since their monuments are not extinguished in the chiefest street of our greatest city."'6 Abbot's censures were moderate in tone, and he made it plain that his principal concern was to prevent the cross from becoming "a very ready way unto superstition." His attitude was molded by his recollection of a young man of Balliol College who had been caught "beating his breast before a crucifix, in a window, which caused the masters and fellows to pull it down and set up other glass. Which example makes me nothing doubt, but that the Cross in Cheapside hath many in the twilight and morning early which do reverence before it." He objected also-not unreasonably-to the element of anthropomorphism involved in the portrayal (on the crucifix) of God the Father as an old man, because, "God is a spirit, and he himself forbids any similitude or shape of himself when he gave the law, intending that he filleth heaven and earth." Abbot felt "it implieth great weakness of faith when we cannot think of our Saviour, either by meditation or prayer, or reading, or hearing the word, or by receiving the sacraments, but we must fly unto such 14.

George Abbot, Cheapside Cross Censured and Condemmed (London, 1641), p. 7. 175</page><page sequence="5">CHURCH HISTORY means as for the use whereof we have no warrant." Yet he was careful to distance himself from the Puritans by accepting that even if the cross was pulled down, the name would remain in common use. No harm, he believed, would result from the common use of the name, for "the name shall hurt no more than the name of Christmas or Candlemas doth." In many ways the most significant part of the letter is the particular emphasis Abbot placed on order and due respect for authority. "I pray the Reader to observe that I say the magistrates are to redress such enormities, for I do not permit inferior men to run headlong about such means and to rend, break and tear as well within as without the churches . but the advice and consent of superior powers to be had herein, that all things may be done decently and in order. In which respect I hold it necessary that the bishop of Canterbury [Whitgift] and the bishop of London [Bancroft] be sought unto, who doubtless upon the sober intention of the governors of that city will be pleased religiously and gravely, according unto their manifold wisom which God has given unto them, to look into the matter and give instructions what is fittest to be done.""7 The cross was in fact restored. In March 1600 Abbot had been made dean of Winchester and from then until his accession to Lichfield and Coventry in 1609, he grew steadily in reputation both within and outside the University of Oxford. This growth was largely through the contacts and opportunities he gained through his influential patrons. The first of these was Thomas Sackville, Earl of Dorset and Lord Treasurer, but after his death in 1608 Abbot found a replacement in George Home, Earl of Dunbar, Lord Treasurer of Scotland and an intimate friend of James I for many years. Abbot served two further terms as Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, in 1603 and 1605, but he was also becoming better known outside the university. In 1600 he published under the title of "Exposition upon the Prophet Jonah" the popular lectures which he had delivered in Saint Mary's church, Oxford, over the course of the previous six years, and in 1605 he produced an anti-catholic tract, "The reasons which Dr. Hill hath brought for the upholding of papistry . . . unmasked and showed to be very weak." Abbot's reputation as a forcible lecturer is evinced by the notes taken by John Manningham of the Middle Temple, of a sermon he preached at the Temple Church in 1602.18 Although no record exists of any speeches he made, yet it would appear that Abbot was present, along with Bancroft, at the Hampton Court Conference in 1604.19 The preface to Dr. Barlow's "Sum and Substance of the Hampton Court Conference" mentions that for his account of the last two days of the conference he used "divers copies," of which one was the dean of 17.

Dent, Protestant Reformers in Elizabethan Oxford (Oxford, 1983), p. 229. 176</page><page sequence="6">GEORGE ABBOT Winchester's.20 Moreover, Additional and Harleian MSS contain two lists of the personnel at the conference (with no indication of their authorship), the latter being more comprehensive, but among the "anti-puritans" both mention "Abbotts."21 Certainly Abbot's scholarship was recognized in the conference's only major achievement since he was one of the 54 men chosen to start preparing the new translation of the Bible (completed 1611). He was a member of the group of Oxford divines entrusted with revising the earlier translations of the Gospels, the Acts, and the Apocalypse. In 1606, as dean of Winchester, George Abbot was present at the Convocation of that year. Presumably, he took an active part there in the discussion concerning Dr. Overall's book, which advocated the doctrine of non-resistance to defacto rulers, since he was honored with a letter from King James on this matter, the significance of which I shall return to later. Abbot's growing reputation with the king, evinced by this signal mark of confidence in his judgment, cannot have escaped the notice of Bancroft. Also the king undoubtedly approved the part played by Abbot in reestablishing episcopacy in Scotland in 1608; it was a long-cherished ideal of his. Prior to James's accession to the English throne, Bancroft "managed a secret correspondence with King James in Scotland, insinuating unto him the necessity of conform- ing the churches of both kingdoms in government and forms of worship, and laying down a plot for restoring episcopacy to that kirk."22 Certainly Abbot's labors in Scotland were of the greatest importance in his rising career since, shortly after his return from that kingdom, he was nominated bishop of Lichfield and Coventry on 27 May 1609. In a letter of 17 April 1609 Bancroft had informed the Earl of Salisbury that he had a candidate in mind for the vacant see of Lichfield, whom he hoped his lordship would support, thus binding " a very worthy man unto you." In the absence of any further evidence it is impossible conclusively to identify the primate's nominee as Abbot, but it is quite plausible. A letter from Abbot, when bishop of London, to Salisbury detailing his confiscation of "some few Puritan books" from scrivener Dixon, and another showing his concern to prevent the circulation of popish literature smuggled in from overseas, could thus be interpreted as an attempt to convince the lord treasurer that he had been justified in supporting Abbot's candidacy.23 Abbot's elder brother, Robert, had won King James's approval by anti-papal tracts and became his chaplain in 1603. This relationship may have given an initial boost to George Abbot's career, but he soon outstripped 20. William Barlow, Sum and Substance of the Hampton Court Conference (London, 1604). 21.

If the favor shown to Robert is anything to go by, the new bishop quickly established friendly relations with the aging primate. Through Bancroft's influence as Chancellor of Oxford University, Robert Abbot was promoted to the mastership of Balliol College. He showed his gratitude by dedicating his sermon "The Old Way" (1610) to the archbishop, and publicly thanked him for this "place, as by your Grace's favour hath befallen me, without my expectation."24 Bancroft also doubtless would have approved of the firm stand Abbot took against all manifestations of nonconformity, whether Puritan or Roman Catholic, as shown in the letters to Salisbury mentioned above. On 22 February 1611 Abbot wrote to King James conveying the fears of the archbishop of Glasgow that Dunbar's death would prove a setback to church affairs in Scotland. The archbishop had written to Abbot beseeching him to "become an humble remembrancer to your majesty, and suitor to my poor power, that such a one may be appointed to second that business, as will take it up, where my late lord Dunbar did leave it."25 Abbot excused his presumption in offering his advice in the affairs of that church because of the knowledge he had gained through his employment in Scotland "as also by reason of divers particulars which I have had from the mouths of my two most honourable lords of Canterbury [Bancroft] and Dunbar who rest now with God."25 Since the bishopric of London was the second most important see in the land, from the administrative point of view, such hints could be interpreted as implying that by the end of Bancroft's archiepiscopate Abbot was working closely with the elderly prelate, much as Bancroft had in his turn (when bishop of London) collaborated with archbishop John Whitgift. An interesting insight into the relationship between Bancroft and Abbot is given in an account by John Howson (prebend of Christ Church, Oxford) of his interview with King James and Abbot (who was by that time archbishop) when he was called upon to answer charges of laxity against popery brought by Dr. Robert Abbot, on 10 June 1615.26 The discussion became heated and resulted in a rather undignified squabble. Abbot asserted that Bancroft had held Howson for a papist; Howson denied this, but said he believed Abbot had done his best to persuade the archbishop that it was so. He continued, "I affirmed that when Bishop Bancroft was bishop of London, he held his Grace Abbot for a Puritan and said in my hearing that were he not a dean already he should never have that dignity in the Church of England, if he or his friends could possibly hinder him." Hereupon Abbot appealed to the king "if he knew not his Bancroft's love to him: yea said his majesty," but pointed out that Howson was referring to the time when Bancroft was bishop of London 24.

Howson added that the cause of dissension was "by reason of a tract which his Grace Abbot wrote against the Cross in Cheap and that Bishop Ravis brought him into favour again." This task was presumably the more easily effected by Ravis, since (according to Howson) Abbot speedily came to recant his earlier opposition to the rebuilding of the cross. In fact when Abbot preached Bancroft's funeral sermon, 25 November 1610, "he did highly commend him for setting up the Cross in Cheapside."27 King James managed to effect a truce, born of expediency, between Abbot and Howson, with the latter being urged to preach more against papists. It is a pity that Abbot has not left any account of the interview, but the absence of an account would seem to confirm the hypothesis that having originally had some difference of opinion over the Cheapside Cross in 1600, his relationship with Bancroft underwent a steady improvement, with Thomas Ravis (bishop of London from 1607 and a determined opponent of nonconformists) playing an important mediating role. The reconciliation between Bancroft and Abbot was probably effected during Ravis's tenure of the see of London when he would have had most influence, and the closest relationship, with the archbishop. Ravis and Abbot were members of the same Oxford committee for the translation of the Authorized Version of the Bible. Also, we know that in June 1609 Abbot (when elect of Lichfield) was at dinner in company with both Bancroft and Ravis, and he entreated the archbishop to bestow a prebend upon Thomas James, the first keeper of the Bodleian library. Bancroft "was very willing to hearken to it and promised to do what in him lay."28 On 11 November 1609 James was presented to the rectorship of Midley in Kent by the archbishop of Canterbury. But the clearest possible evidence of the close relationship between the aging primate and his successor comes in Bancroft's will. In it Bancroft cited Abbot (bishop of London) as his first choice to preach his funeral sermon and appointed both him and the bishop of Chichester (Samuel Harsnett) to be overseers of his will. For this office the latter was bequeathed "my best basin and ewer of silver guilt." The archbishop continued: "and touching my lord of London, if it should not please God and his Majesty that he may succeed me in the archbishopric, then I give and bequeath unto him for his said pains the sum of one hundred marks to bestow in plate at his pleasure in remembrance bf me his faithful friend."29 It may be that Bancroft simply had resigned himself to the fact that Abbot would succeed him. But if, as seems more likely, Bancroft approved of such an appointment, he had good reasons for doing so. Abbot was as concerned as 27. Calderwood, History of the Kirk, 6: 152. 28. G.W.

When bishop of London, Abbot had worked with Bancroft in the House of Lords defending the rights of the church, a policy he continued as archbishop.30 Abbot continued his predecessor's battle to uphold the jurisdiction of the High Commission, which was threatened by the large and increasing number of prohibitions issued to hinder the court's work. His efforts culminated in an inconclusive conference between him and Sir Edward Coke (Chief Justice of Common Pleas) on this matter, with the king as mediator, on 23 May 1611.31 Later in the year their paths clashed again when Coke refused to sit on the new High Commission because, he felt, it "contained divers points against the laws and statutes of England." When writing an account of this affair in his "Reports," Coke put "Bancroft" instead of Abbot: a telling slip, perhaps, and one which could be taken to support the argument that the two prelates were working closely together by the end of Bancroft's archiepiscopate.32 The distinct probability that Bancroft had faith in his successor makes all the more ironic the accusation of Professor Trevor-Roper that his life's work was ruined by Abbot: "The fact that Abbot's elevation meant a complete reversal of Bancroft's work does not seem to have troubled King James: it was no doubt more important to him that the new archbishop shared his own passion for hunting."33 Obviously, George Abbot's relationship with King James was of pre- eminent importance in his rise to the primacy. The relationship had begun in 1603 when, as Vice-Chancellor he had carried to the king at Woodstock the congratulations of the University of Oxford on his accession.34 Later in the year Abbot came to James's notice again through Oxford's forceful "Answer" to the Millenary Petition of the Puritans, issued in the name of the Vice-Chancellor and other leading men of the university.35 Then in August 1605 when the king visited Oxford he was welcomed on behalf of the university by Abbot, Vice-Chancellor for the third time. During his stay, the sovereign was entertained at New College by the Chancellor, the Earl of Dorset, and he attended a theological debate over which Abbot presided. Judging from Dorset's congratulatory letter to Abbot, this visit was a great success with James I and the delighted Chancellor promised, "I shall bring 30. S.P. Dom. 14/56/9. 31.

Abbot had proceeded M.A. in 1585 and about the same time taken holy orders, thereafter devoting himself to the study of theology and to tutorial work in the university until in 1593 he received his B.D. and four years later the degree of D.D. In Oxford he soon won a reputation as a powerful preacher. His style was far from that of a court prelate, being simple and direct, occasionally pedantic, and he had an acute command of a telling phrase, which impressed the minds of his intelligent, though predomi- nantly youthful, audience. Dorset, who in his will expressed his confidence in his election to grace,37 probably shared Abbot's theological opinions, while the young Fellow's passion for order and maintenance of due authority was in accordance with Dorset's determination to have good government in the university.38 This similarity of ideals would explain why he chose Abbot as one of his chaplains. His patronage was of tremendous importance. It resulted in George Abbot's election as Master of University College in 1597 at the comparatively early age of thirty-five, his nomination to the deanery of Winchester in 1600, and his first election as Vice-Chancellor of Oxford in 1600. Abbot's gratitude is shown in the dedication of "Jonah" to his patron: "I should be very forgetful and unthankful if I did not to my uttermost let all men understand . . . of your lordship's own disposition to think on my preferment."39 In 1605 he also dedicated to Dorset "the reasons which Dr. Hill hath brought for the upholding of papistry . . . unmasked." As Lord Treasurer, Dorset would have been in frequent contact with the king and doubtless informed him of his high opinion of Abbot's abilities. Abbot's presence at the Hampton Court Conference shows that King James had already been favourably impressed by the dean of Winchester. By 1606 the king had sufficient faith in Abbot's political awareness, as well as in his religious sympathies, to write a letter to him when angered by the behavior of Convocation, which, in giving its approval to Overall's "Book," had involved itself in theorizing about the nature of lawful government. James I, who feared that the opening of this Pandora's box might have alarming consequences, reminded Abbot, "my title to the crown nobody calls in question but they that neither love you nor me, and you may guess who I 36.

The king used Abbot as the means of expressing his disapproval to the clergy at large, writing the postscript in his own hand: "I shall give you my orders about it by Mr. Solicitor and until then meddle no more in it; for they are edge-tools, or rather like that weapon, that's said to cut with the one edge and cure with the other. I commit you to God's protection, good doctor Abbot, and rest your good friend James R."40 The letter marks a very distinct stage in the growth of Abbot's reputation. The king's opinion of George Abbot became increasingly favourable after Abbot had taken a leading part in one of James's pet projects, the re- establishment of episcopacy in Scotland. Abbot's role came about following the death in 1608 of his patron, the Earl of Dorset, whose funeral sermon, which Abbot preached at Westminster Abbey on 26 May, was published soon afterwards.41 Presumably, it was through his link with Dorset and his developing relationship with the king that Abbot had been brought to the notice of Dunbar, who speedily became his new patron. Dorset and Dunbar were close friends, as is shown by the bequest in Dorset's will to "my special good lord and friend the Earl of Dunbar, a pair of gilt flagons with mine arms therein to be graven and to contain in weight 300 ozs of silver."42 Similar bequests were made to Bancroft and to Abbot. These bequests in themselves argue more of a parity between Bancroft and Abbot than is usually accepted and the fact that both were members of Dorset's circle could be taken as reinforcing the view that the two prelates were on good terms with each other. The Earl of Dunbar (Lord High Treasurer of Scotland) shared with Lord Chancellor Dunfermline the chief management of Scottish affairs from about 1605. It was through the assistance of these men that King James was able to make his vaunt in Parliament in 1607: "This I must say for Scotland ... here I sit and govern it with my pen ... which others could not do by the sword." Dunbar played an important part in carrying out the king's ecclesiastical policy in Scotland. The church in that kingdom which had emerged since the overthrow of the Roman Catholic order in the civil war of 1559-1560 was Calvinist in theology and by the 1580s was dominated by a group of ministers headed by Andrew Melville, who favored the Presbyterian system of government and who denounced episcopacy as unscriptural.43 James's scheme for a union with England worried these ministers since they feared it would lead to the establishment of a unified episcopal Church, Anglican in doctrine. Although the union proved abortive, the king, who had suffered so 40. E. Cardwell, Synodalia, 2 vols. (Oxford, 1842), 1: 334. 41.

Dunbar had succeeded in obtaining an act to restore the bishops to their temporalities and to repeal the Act of Annexation (annexing revenues to the crown) in the parliament of Perth in 1606. But there was much resistance by the Scottish clergy, and in July 1608 a General Assembly of the Kirk was summoned at Linlithgow to give thorough effect to the episcopal reforms. Abbot had accompanied his patron Dunbar, and Sir William Bowyer, who was in attendance upon Dunbar at Edinburgh, wrote to the Earl of Salisbury on 2 August 1608 that "both ministers and people showed themselves most glad of Mr dean of Winchester . . . which greatly pleased my Lord of Dunbar."44 In 1610, Dunbar "entirely governed in this matter by his chaplain's advice," procured the act in the General Assembly which completed the restoration of diocesan episcopacy in Scotland.45 Abbot, who was by now bishop of London, put the finishing touch to the contribution made by his conciliatory tone and statesmanlike behavior by presiding at the consecration of the bishops of Glasgow, Brechin, and Galloway in Ocotober 1610. Abbot rendered the king another service while he was in Scotland by giving his unquestioning testimony in the affair of Gowrie's conspiracy. He wrote a preface to Sir William Hart's account of the trial of George Sprot, who was tried as accessory in the plot and was executed in Edinburgh during Abbot's stay in that city. Abbot had no doubt of Sprot's guilt and reminded his readers that Sprot had confessed as much himself: "My fault, saith he, is so great that if I had a thousand lives and could die ten thousand deaths, yet I might not make satisfaction, that I could conceal such a treason against so gracious a king."46 Abbot took this occasion to justify the Royal Supremacy over the Church. "We here may see the lord's protection over Christian kings and princes, whom as he placeth next himself in majesty and authority, and calleth them by his own name 'I have said, ye are Gods' (Psalm 82:6), so he blesseth and upholdeth them as his deputies and viceregents." Abbot's warning to disturbers of the public peace was consistent with his belief in order and obedience to those in authority: "We [the clergy] are to go before our flocks and congregations in obedience and obsequiousness unto the Christian magistrate, not in sowing sedition or making of mutinies, to the disturbance of the state."47 James had good reason to believe that he had found a man after his own heart! 44.

A mark of the king's favor was that he remitted the first fruits payable for the see of Lichfield in view of Abbot's speedy removal from there.48 Moreover Abbot's election on 24 December 1609, only ten days after the death of the previous incumbent, Ravis, argues a high degree of forethought on the sovereign's part. It seems likely, therefore, that already in 1609 the king was preparing the way for Abbot to succeed Bancroft. His favorable opinion of Abbot can only have been strengthened by Bancroft's increasing regard for the new bishop of London and Abbot's industrious activity in seeking to suppress nonconformity. The letters to Salisbury, mentioned earlier, are evidence of his attention to duty, which had been noticeable from the time when he had only been elect of Lichfield. He told Salisbury of the discovery of a pardon offered by the pope to those aiding "the Catholic King" of Spain against heretics. Those who would contribute toward this holy cause were instructed to affix their names in the space provided and this particular blank contained the signature of Thomas Simons. There were two known recusants of that name, and Abbot reported to Salisbury that he intended to take the matter up with him and investigate it thoroughly.49 Abbot's zeal and indefatigable diligence in the public exercise of his function were so outstanding, and the conduct of his private life so exemplary, that an epigram was addressed to him at this time by John Davies of Hereford: "The serpent's wisdom, Dove-like innocence, Thy head and heart doth harbour, so that thou with grace dost bear high fortune's eminence, which, for thy worthes, she doth on thee bestow."50 Whether King James saw the then bishop of London in quite so hallowed a light is doubtful. But he had a sufficiently high opinion of him, coupled with various good reasons of his own, to favor him rather than Lancelot Andrewes, bishop of Ely, the other chief contender for the archiepiscopate. James greatly admired Andrewes's learning and talent for theological controversies such as that in which he engaged at the king's request with Cardinal Bellarmine; but he felt that the prelate had virtually no experience as a man of affairs and was not suited to the archbishop's other roles as courtier and politician. Sir Thomas Bodley's letter to Thomas James of 26 February 1611 provides an insight into contemporary expectations at this time: "It is not among us in speech, that the king hath said, he will publish out of hand, who shall be our metropolitan. Whether Winchester [Bilson] or London [Abbot] it is very 48. S.P. Dom. 38/9 (Docquet; 24 December 1609). 49. Additional MS 6178. f. 208 (British Library). 50. John Davies, The Scourge of Folly (London, 1610), p. 187. 184</page><page sequence="14">GEORGE ABBOT uncertain."s5 According to Beylin, King James's eventual choice of Abbot as archbishop came as a surprise to the court bishops, who felt that Andrewes would be the most suitable successor to Richard Bancroft, who died on 2 November 1610.52 The traditional view is that Abbot had no belief in his own chances of promotion-"he did first creep, then run, then fly into preferment, or rather preferment did fly upon him without his expectation"53-and that the sole reason for his election was the influence of his patron Dunbar with King James. Secretary Calvert's literary talents helped sustain the myth that Abbot's appointment by the king was "merely the recommendation of his faithful servant Dunbar that is dead," since he wrote in a letter to Sir Thomas Edmondes on 10 March 1611 a most evocative and memorable sentence: "The bishop of London, by a strong North wind coming out of Scotland, is blown over the Thames to Lambeth."54 It may be true that promotion came upon Abbot unexpectedly, though by the time he was appointed bishop of London he must have been fully aware of the king's regard. Perhaps he felt that he was too much of a newcomer to the episcopate to be in the running for Canterbury. But while Dunbar's influence was no doubt of considerable assistance in furthering Abbot's career, it is unlikely it was decisive in making up the mind of James I, who was far too shrewd and aware of his own needs and desires not to have thought very clearly about such an important piece of preferment. It was several months before the king's decision about the vacant archbish- opric became known, quite possibly because James had been taken by surprise by Bancroft's death and had expected a longer interval in which to see how well the bishop of London, whom he had in mind as Bancroft's most likely successor, measured up to his new responsibilities. He was also aware that Abbot's nomination was not likely to prove very popular, especially as he had only been a bishop for one and a half years and had never even been incumbent of a parish. Thus the death of Dunbar on 30 January 1611 provided the king with an excellent excuse to appoint the man he wanted, under guise of remaining faithful to a trusted servant's last wishes. Cynicism, streaked with sentimentality, would seem characteristic of James I, who, according to Sir Thomas Lake's letter to Salisbury of 28 February 1611, wished it to be known that "though he [Dunbar] were not living, that the world might say he guided his majesty: yea for the affection he bore to him living he now performs his request that the world might see that as did find 51.

(London, 1849), 1:110. 185</page><page sequence="15">CHURCH HISTORY good servants he did love them dead as well as living."55 This was the image James wished to present, since it could prove very useful as a shield for the king's judgment should Abbot's archiepiscopate prove disastrous. However, the more substantial reasons given in the letter were that "his majesty had a good opinion of him [Abbot] for his own part" and "besides his majesty said my lord of London was young, able of body to take pains and industrious of spirit and so very fit for an active place as that was." At the age of forty-eight Abbot was indeed young for such an onerous and distinguished position, younger than any post-Reformation archbishop of Canterbury with the exception of Cranmer. As for his vigor, this had been amply demonstrated as had his concern for the well-being of the Church of England.56 There are many references in "Jonah" to Abbot's awareness of the harm done by greedy lay improprietors who allowed only a pittance to the minister and also to those quarrelsome parishioners who forced a vicar to seek redress at law in order to collect what was due to him. Many such "to maintain an able minister, have not a penny, their charge is so great and so many ways they are burdened: but to disturb their preacher or call him in question, or make him stand in law for his tithes and due maintenance, they have money enough."57 King James probably was attracted to George Abbot because of a combination of his theological learning and the conciliatory and skillful statesmanlike behavior he showed in Scotland. He also had good reason to believe that Abbot could be relied on to uphold the Royal Supremacy and maintain peace and order in the church. In addition George Abbot had demonstrated his commitment to episcopacy and to the principle that, as far as the government of the church was concerned, bishops should be loyal and dutiful servants of their Governor. Yet if James believed that Abbot would be subservient, he was mistaken, for where loyalty to the king clashed with Abbot's conscience and his sense of his godly duty, there was no doubt which would prevail. The king was to discover this to his cost in 1613 with the shameful episode of the Essex divorce case, when Abbot would not follow the king's instructions to pronounce in favor of annulment. James's sense of outrage on that occasion was expressed in his amazement that "you, who are so far my creature" should contradict him, particularly since he had been able to persuade the normally high- minded Andrewes to agree to the annulment.58 James was to discover that in matters of morality Abbot lived up to Horace's ideal of "the just man" as one who "tenacious of his purpose will not be shaken from his set resolve by the 55.

James I had been closely monitoring Abbot's career since their first introduction in 1603 and it would seem probable that by the time he was elevated to the bishopric of London in February 1610, the king had already decided he was the most promising candidate to succeed Archbishop Bancroft. As for Bancroft himself, the better he came to know Abbot the more he realized how many major aims they shared. Most notable among these aims was their determination to keep up the pressure against Roman Catholic recusants and Puritan separatists and nonconformists who threatened the unity, as well as the uniformity, of the established Church of England. This is not the place for a discussion of Abbot's archiepiscopate, but it may be suggested that Clarendon's judgment of him is excessively harsh. Comparing Bancroft's virtues as a disciplinarian with the latitudinarian tendencies of his successor, Clarendon claimed that, had Bancroft lived longer, he "would have quickly extinguished all that fire in England which had been kindled at Geneva or if he had been succeeded by Bishop Andrewes, Bishop Overall or any man who understood and loved the Church."60 Rightly or wrongly, both Richard Bancroft and James I obviously thought they had found such a man in George Abbot. 59.
