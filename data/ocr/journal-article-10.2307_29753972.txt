<plain_text><page sequence="1">FREDERICK II AP MOSLEM C?TOE The starting point of all enquiries into the relations between Frederick and Arabian-Isla? mic culture is to be found, of course, in Arab Norman Sicily to which the ties of blood of the great Costanza bound him, as did also his childhood and early adolescence and the Royal Crown he wore. If, for fortuitous circumstan? ces, Frederick was born in the Marche, and if the well-known predilection of his mature years led him to live by preference and to die in the Apulian tableland, his character was formed in Sicily, and it was there that he im? bibed the first elements of his intellectual per? sonality and culture. And here the problem arises, to what extent did Arab culture survive in Sicily in the late years of the 12th and the first of the 13th century, when the political rule of Islam had ceased for more than a hun? dred years and the political and religious, ethnic and social crises that occurred under the rule of the Norman kings had gradually eliminated the residual remains of Moslem cul? ture from the Island. It is well known that Ibn Giubair, on the occasion of his journey from Messina to Trapani in 1185, found much of the language and culture of the Arabs and of Moslem beliefs and customs in the Island, but four or five years after that date this te? nacious ethnic and cultural survival, tolerated if not favored by the more enlightened of the Norman rulers, had suffered a decisive col? lapse. Around the year 1190 the Moslem urban settlements, above all that of Palermo, had been dispersed and forced to seek refuge in the mountains; and if the Spanish pilgrim had passed again through Palermo during the orphaned boyhood of Frederick he would no longer have felt as much at his ease as when he went with his Moslem friends to oggle the pretty Sicilian girls at the Christmas Mass at the Martorana. But this liquidation of Arab influences in the cities as a feature of com? munity life did not, of course, imply in indi? vidual cases the total extinction of the race and its culture, and it is not only probable but positively avouched by both Eastern and Western sources that Arab-Moslem elements played a part in the upbringing of the young Swabian, even though our curiosity to know their names remains unsatisfied. To the en? quiry made by Kantorowicz as to whether some sage Imam may not have acted as Chiron to the isolated youth in Palermo, a Moslem historian of the 13th century, unknown to Amari, gives the specific answer that he was (( educated by the Cadi of the Moslems x&gt;, an Islamic doctor who remained in the Court circles even after the dispersion of the orga? nised Moslem community from the Capital. And during the Crusade in the Holy Land more than one of the pages of Frederick s re? tinue rose at the call of the Muezzin to the ritual prayers, a among them his teacher, a native of Sicily, with whom he had studied logic ?; perhaps the same Chiron or Aristo? teles of Palermo who had introduced the Swabian to the language and culture of his forefathers who had formerly ruled over the Island. That the polyglot Frederick under? stood and spoke Arabic is stated by several Western sources (strangely enough no mention of this is made, so far as I know, by Eastern sources). As to his culture, we shall soon see in what direction is specialised. On the other 53</page><page sequence="2">hand, we find recognition in many Arab sour? ces of the philo-Islamic character of the Swa? bian, which is rightly ascribed to his Sicilian origin. More notable than any others is the evidence that has come down to us from Abu l-Fida of that great Shafiite Cadi of Harnat, Gem?l ad-din Muhammad ibn Salim, who in 1260 went as Ambassador of the Mameluke Sultan Baibars to Manfred in the cc long land ? (thus the Oriental geographers of the period called the Italian Peninsula). From this direct contact he received and transmitted the definite impression of the philo-Islamic atti? tude of the last Swabians, which with a com? prehensibly unilateral vision he placed at the centre of their opposition to the Papacy. Thus the young Emperor Frederick, born among Moslems as some Oriental sources would have us believe, was a friend of the Moslems. And yet his first political contact with things Arabic and with Islam was anyth? ing but friendly. It is well known that he definitively liquidated Islam in Sicily, uproot? ing its last remains with a harshness of which an echo reached even the Orient. The guerilla warfare to suppress the last groups of Moslem rebels in the Val di Mazara, more especially among the strongholds of Jato and Entella, was one of the salient episodes in the activities of the Emperor in Sicily. It culminated in the years 1222-23 with the resistence of the ? Mirabetto ? or Ibn Abb?d and the remnants of his followers; it made some sporadic reap? pearances in the two following decades, and finally flickered out in 1243-46 when the last rebels were deported to Lucera. On all this little-known death-agony of the Arab domi? nion in Sicily we have, in addition to the brief items given by the Western Chroniclers, inter? esting first hand details from an Oriental source that Amari published and of which he translated an abstract in his second appendix to the Arabic-Sicilian Library, but was not in time to make use of it in his history. It is the Tarikh Mansuri of an obscure Ayyubite chronicler of Syria, who was a contemporary of the events and well informed not only of the Swabian Imberatur s Crusade, but also, through the account given by some Moslem refugee, of the events in Sicily. To this Tarikh Mansuri we owe our knowledge of the dra? matic episode of the surrender, in 1223, of Ibn Abb?d to Frederick who in anything but regal manner harried his fallen enemy, kick? ing him with his spurred boot and then having him put to death with his two sons. He also tells the tale, which may be linked with another story told by Ibn Said (the chronicler who tells of the Moslem upbringing of the young Prince), of the revenge taken by the daughter or by the son-in-law of the slaughtered head of the Arab-Sicilian revolt, who organised a sanguinary ambush at Entella into which the Imperial troops fell, and of the arrival at Harr an in Mesopotamia, at the court of Malik al-Kamil, of a Moslem refugee from Sicily, probably also the source of the previous news who implored the intercession of the Ayyubite Sultan against the policy of subjection and de? portation to Italy which the Emperor was fol? lowing towards the surviving Moslems of the Island. This was in 1230, shortly after the return of Frederick from the Crusade when his idyllic intercourse with Malik al-Kamil was at its height. In answer to the entreaty of the exile, the Sultan wrote to the Emperor begging him to leave the Moslems of Sicily in peace or, at least, to allow them to emigrate to Egypt. But it does not seem that any practical results came of this request. If we are to unravel the contradiction be? tween the philo-Arab and philo-Islamic Sov? ereign on the one hand, and the persecutor and exterminator of Arab and Islamic currents from their most ancient seat in Italy, a clear distinction must be drawn between cultural and political interests as affecting the thought and actions of Frederick. The two lines might sometimes coincide, indeed, broadly under? stood it may be said that they did coincide in his work and in that of Manfred taken as a whole, as Baibar's Ambassador noted with substantial accuracy. But in the case of the last Moslems of Sicily political and cultural interests did not coincide, and as was always the case the Emperor gave absolute precedence to the former. Whatever may have been his in? tellectual and emotional feelings for Arab and especially Sicilian Arab culture, it was nothing by then but a survival of the past, a vexatious force unwilling to bow to the Imperial autho? rity, to accept the total dispossession of landed property which, during the century of Norman rule, had been gradually transferred in its entirety to the clergy, the feudal nobility and the Christian farmers, reluctant to accept fiscal and administrative enrollment in the solid framework of the Imperial bureaucracy. More? over the cultural and social importance of these Moslem remainders must certainly have been of a low level. The Arab-Sicilian elite had long disappeared as a social force, carried 54</page><page sequence="3">off ever since the early years of the Norman conquest by the migratory current directed towards North Africa, Egypt and Moslem Spain. This emigration had been further ac? centuated by the anti-Moslem riots of 1154 and 1189. Those who still remained at the beginning of the 13th century belonged, for the most part, to the lowest social class, (( people who had now become foreigners and enemies of the country ? as Amari defined them; bands of raiders and brigands among whom the figure of Ibn Abb?d, a man of high intellectual and moral level as portrayed by the Tarikh Mansuri, must have been an ex? ception. It seems moreover that he was not a Sicilian but had immigrated to the Island from Tunis. In as much as these Moslem re? mainders were rebels, causing social unrest and economic injury to Sicily, Frederick could not treat them with indulgence; just as the legislation of this free-thinker, accused by his adversaries of being a (c heretic ?, was very harsh in the repression of heresy in those cases in which it represented a threat or a defiance to imperial authority (from this point of view the Swabian has been described by some as (( the most intolerant Emperor of the Middle Ages ?). As fomenting rebellion they were therefore radically and mercilessly extirpated, but as soon as they no longer represented a danger to the State the philo-Islamic and Oriental sympathies of the Emperor showed themselves in his behavior towards those same deported remainders of Sicilian Islam. When the rebels of Jato and Entella or their offspring became the farmers of Lucera, we find the last Moslem communities of the Italian Middle Ages, reorganised and faithful to their reli? gion, settled on the Apulian Tableland. They were to become the (( Old Guard )) of the Swa bians during the dramatic decline and fall of their power in Italy. Unfortunately, we know but little of the intellectual life of the Sara? cens of Lucera, but all leads us to believe that if it existed at all it was but of little ac? count; and this confirms the fact that Arabian civilisation in Sicily had already been skimm? ed of the cream of its culture before it was transplanted on the mainland. Meantime, while this gradual inland migra? tion which continued over some twenty years was taking place, the Crusade afforded Fre? derick his personal adventure in the East, completing by direct contact with the Arab Islamic world the familiarity he had acquired with it in his Sicilian environment. The lack of enthusiasm with which he set out on this expedition is well known. Under pressure of Papal excommunication he undertook it only for the political purpose of securing a modus vivendi with the Church, and to consolidate his position as the chief Monarch of Christ? endom by the prestige he would acquire as Liberator of the Holy Sepulchre. But though neither sincere religious zeal nor the fascina? tion of distant lands impelled him, he knew admirably well how to make use of the knowl etlge of the Orient he had acquired as a youth when playing the great game of diplomacy rather than of war which was the upshot of his Crusade. Our purpose here is not to relate that epi? sode even in its main lines; and we shall only remind the reader that Frederick dis? played unrivalled skill in taking his part in the intricate game of Ayyubite politics and in availing himself of the rivalries and suspicions among the successors of Saladin to obtain that prestige ? the words are his own as reported by the Orientals themselves ? he so badly needed for reestablishing his position in the Christian world of the West. Without striking a single blow he obtained, as is known, from Malik al-Kamil that partial and precarious possession of Jerusalem, along with a narrow strip of land giving access to the coast, which was sufficient to enable him to crown himself as King and (( save his face ? with both ene? mies and friends. Then, after sojourning a few months in the East ? from the Autumn of 1228 to the Spring of 1229 ? he returned to Italy where his main interests and duties called him. His passage across the stage of Eastern policies was meteoric, and so was the revelation he thus obtained of the genuine Moslem East; what we wish here to enquire into is the impression he left of himself in those countries and the one he obtained while there to complete or corroborate his previous experiences. The singular and baffling personality of this new friend-enemy, so different from that of the other crusading Sovereigns, also from the West, whom they had so far known, did not escape the attention of the Easterners. This man, who in all probability spoke their lan? guage, who came surrounded by a retinue lar? gely composed of Moslems, who showed, as we shall see, that he was familiar with the traditional science of Islam, alternating di? plomatic negotiations with questions of logic and mathematics, physics and metaphysics, 55</page><page sequence="4">which the Malik al-Kamil was to transmit to the specialised experts of his Court for their solutions, could not but arouse the curiosity and strike the imagination of the Moslems. Al-Kamil must have had but few direct con? tacts with him, and as Oriental sources show, all the diplomatic manoeuvering took place through one of his dignitaries, Fakhr ad-din, who handled the business through a series of conferences and embassies, going back and forth. We should indeed like to have the clear echo of the impression made on this Ayyubite diplomat by his royal Frankish part? ner who, after the successful conclusion of the negotiations went, it would seem, so far as to knight him. But those which have come down to us are the impressions received from a more modest but no less direct source, that of the persons attached to the Moslem sanc? tuary (c of the Rock ? in Jerusalem ? the so-called Mosque of Omar ?, excluded, to? gether with other Holy Places of Islam, from the grant stipulated, but which the Emperor obtained permission to visit. To these modest but sagacious observers we can trace back a set of anecdotes collected on the spot by the chronicler Ibn al-Giawzi. They are very sig? nificant because they coincide, in their free expression, with the Western image of a Fre? derick sceptical, mocking, and if we may use the word, mephistophelian on matters of reli? gious beliefs and faith. The strange visitor, cc red-haired, baldish, short sighted; had he been a slave he would not have been worth two-hundred dirham ? ? such is the unro mantic portrait left us by these Orientals, different indeed from the cc blond he was, and handsome, and of courteous aspect )) a des? cription which for us has always been reflected from the son on the father ? began his visit by unceremoniously driving off a Christian priest who had pushed himself in to beg or else evangelise in the Sanctuary; and this might have been a political act of courtesy. But the enquiries he then made of his guides, and his comments on their replies, were such that the good Moslem custodians were led to the conclusions: cc it could be seen from his manner of speaking that he was a materialist and that he only made sport of Christianity )), a judgement which would have rejoiced the Popes Gregory and Innocence, or Friar Sa limbene, had they been able to make use of Ibn al-Giawzi to strengthen the anti-Frederick propaganda. A further incident of this visit of Frederick confirms the ability of his cour teous behaviour to the Moslems, but contains no reference to the freedom of worship grant? ed to Moslems in Italy which Amari read into it; for the Emperor while expressing disap? proval of the suspension of the Muezzin's call to prayer, courteously ordered by the Sultan during Frederick's visit, concluded, ? as we read in the original whence the extract given in the Bibl. Arabo-Sicula is taken ? cc Should you come to my lands I should not forbid for your sake the chiming of the bells ?; but he did not say, cc you would see that the Moslems also observe your rite ? as Amari thought he could complete the sentence. This does not however exclude the fact, well attested both by Easterners and Westeners, that the call to prayer of the Muezzin was heard during the whole of the 13th century, first in Sicily and then in Lucera. When Frederick in April 1229 embarked at Acre for Italy, he left behind him a political situation on which he must have been the first to nourish no illusions; but much more endur? ing than the ephemeral compromise for Je? rusalem (which reminds us of the modern at? tempts to divide the Holy City) was the per? sonal tie of liking and esteem between him and his Ayyubite hosts, feelings which were to survive his Eastern adventure and last until his death. The two letters in very florid Arabic that he addressed to his friend, Fakhr as-din, immediately after his return to Italy ? the important documents have been pre? served for us by the Tarikh Mansuri already mentioned ? are undoubtedly marked not only by oriental rhetoric but also by the recent separation from his friend, and display feel? ings of almost emotional friendship. But the friendly relations with Malik al-Kamil were destined to last long, until his death in 1238, and were prolonged with his son and suc? cessor. Those Orientals must have perceived and appreciated in him not only the cc mate? rialist ? who scandalised the pious Imams of Jerusalem, but also the man of culture and science, the polished knight, the frankish Sovereign who showed that he knew and ad? mired the civilisation of the East. It is not difficult to realise the features of that civilisation, with which he came into direct contact during his sojourn in the Holy Land, which must have most deeply impressed the Emperor. Let us begin with the charac? teristic least congenial to us but which to one of Frederick's mentality and temperament must have struck him as an inviable pattern to fol 56</page><page sequence="5">low: Oriental absolutism, namely the power of an enlightened Sovereign over his subjects as he saw it exercised by the Sultans of Egypt and Syria, free from all the hindrances arising from the privileges and autonomy belonging to the Communes. That thorn in the side of Imperial absolutism was unknown to the Orient, then governed by a system of military feudalism which only needed a Sovereign of dynamic personality, such as Norandine or Saladin, Malik al-Adil or al-Kamil, to keep it in check. And the other age-old enemy of the Empire, the Papacy, did not exist in that happy East, free from the spiritual power of an organised Church and a Supreme Pontiff who could join the spiritual with the temporal power to assert a primacy in conflict with the sovereign authority of the Emperor. There did indeed exist in the East an institution in some respects comparable to the Papacy of the West, the Caliphate, which had been re? duced from its original status of the supreme power in Islam (approximating the position of the Mediaeval Empire in Christendom) to a mere ornamental survival, the spiritual sym? bol of the unity of Orthodox Islam. But Fre? derick during his brief sojourn in the East had been able to realise that a strong State had certainly nothing more to fear from that dying institutions. Indeed, if an anecdote, of which I have been unable to trace the oriental source, be true, the Swabian said to his Mos? lem hosts who were describing to him the nature of that then innocuous cc Oriental Pa? pacy ? founded on descent from the Prophet (they were then in fact the last Abbasides of Bagdad, soon to be swept away once and for all by the Mongols) that such a hereditary primacy was more logical and worthy of res? pect than that of the Roman Pontiff, a po? sition to which a man of low birth might be elected. We have there the aristocratic doc? trine of the nobility of blood ascribed by Dante to Frederick in the Convivio. Had he been more familiar with Islam, he would cer? tainly have given the preference to the Shiite Imam rather than to the Sunnite Caliph as the one mystic depositary of both the spiritual and temporal power. And who can say that he may not have looked with political sym? pathy for a perfect sovereign at the Great Master of the Assassins, the much dreaded Old Man of the Mountain, at whose nod his fanatical followers threw themselves down a precipice in the presence of the astonished Frankish ambassadors. Here we are indeed far from the Frederick dear to the Enlighten? ment, but may be we are nearer to the au? thentic Frederick of history. We shall not here linger long on the more striking but less important side of the oriental habits adopted by the Emperor prior to and certainly yet more after his sojourn in Pales? tine. Perhaps the continuity with the Arab Norman civilisation of Sicily from which he never entirely broke away, may suffice to ex? plain the more picturesque orientalising as? pects of Frederick's Court, the pages (in Arabic ghilm?n, fity?n), Moslems in religion, language and customs, the slaves and hand? maids assigned to the manufacture of yarns and fabrics for the Royal Household (a legacy from the Arab tir?z, on the existence of which in Sicily doubts have been cast but which was certainly known to the Saracen Courts of the Mediterranean), the female singers who enli? vened the banquets, the baths, the seraglios of wild animals. These exotic tastes, strengthen? ed rather than created by the experience gained during the Crusade, gave, as is known, the pretext to the Papal and Guelph controver? sialists to accuse Frederick of formal adoption of the Moslem faith, of practicing oriental dissoluteness, and similar charges. He treated such accusations as a joke, giving an innocent explanation of each of the more suspicious points (the slaves of the Harem were nothing more nor less than craftswomen, the female singers were but the ministers of purely aes? thetic pleasures, and so forth), explanations which were probably somewhat short of the truth just as the suppositions and animosities of his detractors went beyond it. There can be no doubt that the material civilisation of the East, then so much richer and more refined than that of the West, was felt by him to be worthy of assimilation and imitation, and his innately open-minded attitude towards reli? gious questions, one of the salient features of his complex personality, must certainly have favored this stand. But it is no less certain that he never allowed his broad views on re? ligion and his taste for the civilisation and customs of the East, to lead him to an in? tellectual or emotional acceptance of the reli? gion of Islam which contained features repug? nant to his (( materialistic )) vision of life no less than to the Christian vision. We have noted the impression he made on the Moslems themselves: and in the West the attribution to Frederick of the tract De trihus impostoribus is no less significant of this aspect of his cha 57</page><page sequence="6">racter. The third of the impostors is of course Mahomet, and the orthodoxy of the (( Sultan of Sicily ? would have been no less suspect to Islam than it was to the Christian world from which, either for purely political reasons, or for deeper spiritual needs, he never wished to estrange himself entirely, until his Chris? tian death in Castel Fiorentino. * * * And now, that we have got beyond the pu? rely picturesque side, let us come to the central point of his relations with Moslem culture in its purely scientific and intellectual aspects. In so much as we are able to reconstruct from surviving evidence, Frederick's interest in these aspects centred essentially on two branches, their technical attainments and the bridge built by Arabic culture for acquiring a know? ledge of the philosophic thought and science of the classical Antiquity. Both of these in? terests were not peculiar to him alone, but were common to all the most enlightened minds of his age, wherever it was possible to create an intellectual contact with the East ? I think naturally first of all of Spain; ? but they were brought into high relief by the restless vivacity of his talents, the biogra? phical imprints we have of him, and the im? pressive size of his complex personality. The oriental technique in which he took the kee? nest interest was that of falconry, a technique subserviant to his venatorial enthusiasms. As is known he also made a theoretical study of it and enriched by the only personal scientific writing of his that has come down to us ? his De arte venandi cum avibus, in writing which Frederick used oriental sources of in? formation, among which the treatise written by his Moslem falconer, Moamin, translated by Master Theodore from Arabic into Latin, and which the Emperor revised and corrected with his own hand at the siege of Faenza. Moreover, the prologue to his own treatise makes special reference to other contributions made by the East to the science of hunting. If we pass from the venatorial art to such real sciences as astronomy and astrology, optics, mathematics and metaphysics, we meet with the well-known group, studied more especially by Haskins and De Stefano, of Frederick's cultural consultants and correspondents, whose origin or whose scientific work made them mediators between the Eastern and the West? ern worlds. Michael Scot, the most important intellectual personality of the group, was the connecting link between Frederick's environ? ment and the translation centre at Toledo where a century earlier Gherardo of Cremona and other eminent interpreters of ancient Arab science to the West, had worked. From Toledo, where in 1217-20 Michael had worked on the version of Alpetragius, he moved to Bologna and from 1227 until his death in 1235 he was attached to the Court of Frederick for whom he translated from the Arabic the writings of Aristotle with the commentary of Averroes, or for the parts dealing with zoo? logy, from the reelaborations of Avicenna. Of Oriental origin was the other Courts phi? losopher and astrologer, Master Theodorus, who was sent to Frederick in 1236 by al-Kamil of Egypt and who worked as translator, se? cretary and ambassador for oriental affairs, and also as distiller of drugs and syrups. We come across other names of secretaries and translators in Frederick's circle, Giovanni da Palermo, Mose da Palermo, of Arab origin or Sicilian Jews well qualified by birth and education to be the means for cultural ex? change. But besides these Mediaeval orienta? lists or semi-orientalists the Emperor was in direct contact on scientific questions with pure Orientals learned in the Arab-Moslem science, with whom the Emperor was in personal con? tact or with whom through messages and en? quiries he discussed technical points in ma? thematics, physics, philosophy. We have al? ready mentioned the mathematician of al Kamil, Alam ad-din al-Hanafi, Frederick's expert in Syria for the solution of the scien? tific problems he placed before him. Of the other enquiries about optics presented to the learned Moslems by the Emperor, perhaps but we do not know, on the occasion of the Cru? sade, we find traces in a still unpublished work by an Egyptian scientist of the twelfth century. Most famous of all were the cc Si? cilian Questions ? on cosmology, psychology and metaphysics which link the name of the Swabian to that of the almohade Caliph ar Rashid (1232-42) and of the Spanish philo? sopher and mystic Ibn Sab'in (1217-1271). Charged by his Sovereign, Ibn Sab'in replied with a lengthy disquisition, not free from scholastic arrogance and sarcastic gibes at the infidel cc King of the Romans ? who had plac? ed before the learned men of the East four (or five) questions on the Aristotelian doc? trine of the eternity of the world, on the pur? pose and assumptions of metaphysics, on ca? tegories, on the nature of the soul, and it 58</page><page sequence="7">would seem also on some anthropomorphic expressions in the Koran. The Arabian phi? losopher replied with a long exposition of the peripatetic doctrines in their Islamic ver? sion, seasoned lastly with Moslem mysticism (Sufism); we do not know if this reply ever reached Frederick, whether it was translated for him (for we do not think he would have been able fully to understand it in the origin? al) and if so what lights it afforded him, if the problems dealt with did indeed correspond to a personal speculative interest of the Empe? ror's. For we cannot hide the impression that sometimes questions such as these were drawn up more to make a display of learning and perhaps to embarrass his correspondents than to satisfy urgent intellectual curiosity. A general view of the whole field of Ara? bian culture and science that Frederick most prized shows that it is contained within that portion for which the West in the early Middle Ages and later on in the Renaissance was most interested: natural sciences and the sciences of the mind, both of which were not in reality the autocthonous product of the oriental intellect but the elaboration ? often an original one ? of the legacy bequeathed by classic Antiquity, received and developed by the Moslem East in the centuries of its most fertile intellectual activity. This legacy bequeathed by classic culture was not trans? mitted to the East in its pure form, in the genuine texts and in an accurate hierarchy of values that could identify in their historical physiognomy the great representatives of clas? sical thought and science, distinguishing the work of the great masters from that of the epitomists and imitators. Through the com? plications and contaminations of the late classic age, their works reached the East mixed up, Plato with Aristotle and Plotinus, the genuine works of Aristotle with his Neo-Platonising commentators, the authentic works of Hippo? crates, Euclid and Ptolomy with a whole crop of pseudo-epigraphic writings attributed to them. On receiving this patrimony Islam had often further to rearrange it to make it agree with its own religious revelation; but some? times it did so, in the case of the physical, mathematical and natural sciences, to harmo? nize them with experimental enquiries which marked a real step forward over those of the Ancients. This scientific and philosophical patrimony in which, under Oriental appear? ances, shone the genius of ancient Greece, fascinated the choicer spirits of the Latin West, from the translators of Toledo to Al phonso the Wise and the Hohenstaufen Sage with whom we are dealing, the gifted son of Apulia and Sicily. But while his predeces? sors and contemporaries had turned more es? pecially to Spain as the crucible in which the two civilisation were melted and sought in Spain access to Oriental culture, thus under? stood, Frederick was perhaps the first and cer? tainly the major enquirer into Greco-Arabian science who was enabled by the events of his life, by the means he possessed and by the field of action in which he moved, to attain that patrimony direct from its Oriental sour? ces, first Sicily itself, then Syria and Palestine, and later, thanks to the friendships he had made, from Egypt and Africa. Through these channels precious elements came to his know? ledge and to that of his circle, from the au? thentic experimental science of Greece and Islam, notions of mathematics and astronomy, physics, zoology and medicine; and along with them the tenacious superstructure of science ? felt by us to be such but which for that age was no less authentic science ? as? trology, alchemy and magic for which Michael Scot was placed in Dante's Inferno, and in which Frederick's enemies thought they could perceive the cloven hoof of the excommuni? cated Emperor himself. That ? phantomatic Mediterranean world of late antiquity, open to the influences of the Orient ?, as Kanto rowicz has well called it, from which modern science has developed through centuries of strife with its heroes and its victims. Thus the Orient gave to the Swabian Em? peror all the most vital things it had, both good and bad, the finest and in any case the most characteristic fruits of the productive stage of its civilisation. In the 12th century th^l stage was coming to an end, and the great Arabian science of the four previous centu? ries together with the whole spiritual life of the Islamic world was gradually stiffening in a progressive process of narcosis from which only contact with modern Europe was to arouse it. Before falling asleep it passed the torch on to the West; and Frederick well de serves to be called one of the most represen? tative of the cursores in this ((lampadodromia? of civilisation. * * * We have so far spoken of Arab-Moslem institutions, religion and science. Some, and we are the first among them, may feel curious 59</page><page sequence="8">to enquire if and to what extent Frederick knew Arabian poetry, that is to say the most genuinely autocthonous and original form of Moslem culture, for, as we have seen, in the scientific field it was elaborating a foreign legacy. We are well aware of the delicate and uncertain features of this problem. The pos? sible contacts with Arabian poetry by the man who was in addition to all his other activities also himself a poet, and composed and saw others around him forth the first verses in italian language, offer a truly suggestive field of study, but one ? let me say at once ? which as matters stand can only lead to in? ferences. The possibility that Frederick may have known Arab poetry must be measured first of all by the extent of his direct knowl? edge of Arabic, as so far not the slightest trace of translations in this branch have been found. With the rudiments of the language he was undoubtedly acquainted, and perhaps he could also speak Arabic fluently; but we think it would be exaggerated to suppose that he could understand and appreciate the subtle refinements of classic poetry. The two letters in Arabic written to the Emire Fakhr ad-din, in a highly ornate style embellished with quo? tations from al-Mutanabbi and other classical poets, were undoubtedly the work of some Oriental Secretary. The revision of the trans? lation of the Arab treatise on falconry, we know was written by the Emperor with his own hand, but we do not know whether the aim was not so much to check the accurate interpretation of the original but rather the technical accuracy of the text. We must also bear in mind that the last Arab poets of Si? cily had ceased with the reign of the Norman King Roger, and that a hiatus of three quar? ters of a century intervened between the time when the last echoes of the East died down and the birth of the Sicilian school of poetry. All probabilities therefore run counter to the hypothesis of a direct knowledge and imi? tation. At least two poems which can be with as? signed with greater certainty to Frederick, and all or almost all the more ancient lyrical pro? duction that arose around the royal threshold of Sicily, was inspired, as is well known, by the form and spirit of the Provencal poetry. And here the Orient would once more peep in if we accept in full the cc Arab theory ? of Ribera, Nykl, Menendez Pidal, on the twofold influence, affecting both form and idea, that Arab poetry exercised through the Pyrenees on the dawning poetry of Provence. This notion may be again discussed. The modest personal opinion of the writer of this article, one which he has more than once stated, is affirmative as regards metrical influence ? ranging from the popular Arab zagial of Spain to the stanzas of the Troubadours, the Galician cantigas, the lauds of Fra Jacopone ? it is more doubtful as to the influence of ideas, for that would require us to assume a greater direct knowledge in the Romanic peoples of Arabian learned poetry in which the idea of (c courteous love ? is expressed. Frederick may certainly have been familiar with some of the Arab-Sicilian popular poetry ? nothing of which however has come down to us, not even an explicit assertion of its existence ? or with the Spanish or Oriental one. On the other hand he may, to an extent and in ways we cannot determine, have had some direct knowl? edge of the classical Arab love poetry, not in stanza form, of that conception of love as a service rendered, as surrender, vassalage, which was accepted as canonical in the East as early as the 8th century by Abbas ibn al-Ahnaf, the Minstrel of Harun ar-Rashid Bagdad, and was perpetuated in a whole Arabic poetic tradition both in the East and in the West. It is, however, much more prudent and more probable to continue to perceive the direct antecedent of Sicilian vulgar poetry in that of the Troubadours who in the first de? cades of the 13th century had already crossed the Alps and affected the intellectual and social life of North Italy. Our enquiries into the ? Arab )) Frederick we have here made do not blind us to the fact that he was open to many other influences and that his many-sided per? sonality was certainly not limited to his Oriental sympathies. That the Provengal poets may in their turn have transmitted to the dawning Italian lyric poetry of the North and still more so of the South of the Peninsula forms and ideas which may have reached them from the other side of the Pyrenees is a pos? sibility which we Arabists will certainly not exclude, but we do not feel justified in gene? ralising and in speaking of it as a certainty. In any case it would only show an indirect influence between the East and the incunabula of our poetry. In this review7 we are aware that we have isolated rather artificially one side of the great Swabian. His striking figure, not of course free from shades and not so uncondi 60</page><page sequence="9">tioned by his age as some romantic historians have figured him, stands out truly great for the multiplicity of his interests, his enthu? siasms, his ties with his own age, his fore? casts of the future, all of which fully justify the assiduous work historians have and are devoting to him, and which the centenary ce? lebrations held in 1950 revived. Among the many eminent persons who have dealt with this matter, our modest paper is justified by the part that Oriental civilisation played in Frederick's life from, one may truly say, the cradle to the grave. As the unknowTn Moslem Chiron revealed to the child in the royal pa? lace of Palermo the beliefs and the culture that for three centuries had held sway in Sicily, so the ancient Mosque-Cathedral of Palermo received him at the end of his earthly journey, wrapped in precious Arabian drape? ries, on which were embroidered the titles of an Oriental Sovereign. There for seven cen? turies has slept he who for the Arabs of the East was the al-Imbratur, but for many friends and enemies of the West as-Sult?n, as we read inscribed in Arabic letters on the embroided robe in which he was laid in his tomb. A Sultan for the pomp, the whims and brutalities of a despot, for the irregularities of his life, but also, like in this to an al Mam?n of Baghdad or an Abd ar-Rahman of Cordova, for his magnanimous thirst for knowledge, his patronage of the arts, his restless intellectual curiosity. The romantic historians may be set aside, but no one can deny that this last scion of Swabia possessed these qualities in high degree; and they would suffice, even if there were nothing else, to assure him our admiration and respect.
