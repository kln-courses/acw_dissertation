<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Diatessaron Miniatures Once More Carl Nordenfalk I My old friend Meyer Schapiro has paid me a rare compli- ment by gathering around him the best brains among his students for the purpose of subjecting my paper on the Persian Diatessaron manuscript in Florence to a thorough scrutiny. Mistakes, even fundamental ones, can be made by anyone, and I for one am only grateful to have them correc- ted, as Shapiro has done for me before in the matter of a paper I once wrote on the Calendar of 354.1 Even if I should prove to be as wrong on every essential point as my severe critic tries to demonstrate, I should not regret my paper, if only because it has elicited from him such an impressive display of sagacity and erudition. However, it may also occur that a confrontation of divergent opinions fails to lead to any unchallengeable result, and while I acknowledge Schapiro's objections in some cases, there are others, and rather fundamental ones, which I am unable to accept, as will appear from what follows. The almost complete lack of unequivocally datable works of art is the main reason that the beginning of Christian art is still, to a great extent, wrapped in obscurity. The sudden beam of light cast into the darkness by the discovery of the Christian house chapel at Dura Europos, revealing a number of New Testament scenes of a type that few of us would have imagined possible in the first half of the third century, remains a unique case, not likely to be soon re- peated. Consequently, one is always on the lookout for supplementary evidence provided by copies of lost monu- ments, and it is here that the illuminated manuscripts deserve our particular attention. If they happen to contain some rare textual material connected with the early period of the Church, such as Tatian's Diatessaron, there is, at least theoretically, a chance that, if illustrated, they might also preserve traces of more or less contemporary book decoration, even when they are separated from their archetype by several centuries. When I became aware of the miniatures placed as a colophon in the copy of the Persian version of Tatian's Gospel harmony, it seemed to me that this might be one of these cases. I was of course aware of the fact that the other versions of the same text lack illustrations. But it should be remembered that the Persian Diatessaron of 1547 is a unique case even textually, having preserved more authentic Tatianic readings than any other extant version. Why, then, should not the line of transmission represented by this manuscript also have retained traces of an original supple- mentation of the text by images ? It is true that Grabar in his Mellon lectures, precisely with regard to illuminated manuscripts, warns against placing too great hopes on our ability to derive from later copies "lost prototypes which one infers a priori to have been more complete and more intelligently composed than the extant works, the only ones that can be examined."2 If ever the difficulties inherent in such a kind of research are obvious, it is with regard to the miniature cycle of the Florence Diatessaron. From more than one point of view, the odds that it should preserve traces of an archetype of the late second century are not favorable. One of the pictures shows Christ's Entry into Jerusalem, a scene that according to the handbooks does not make its appearance in Christian art before the second quarter of the fourth century. This fact alone would, I am sure, have deterred every experienced scholar from claiming a pre-Constantinian origin for it. On the other hand, however, the Dura discoveries have proved that what may appear unlikely could yet be true. Before the principal scene in the Dura Baptistery, the Women at the Tomb, came to light, an orthodox student of Early Christian art could easily have proved that this event, recounted in all the Gospels, was not illustrated before the turn of the fourth century. Yet, there it was, in a third-century Chris- tian house chapel in a small border town of the Roman Empire where it certainly could not have been invented. Moreover, Grabar has shown in his Christian Iconography that in general "image-signs have chronological priority over narrative images." The character it has as "image-sign" rather than narrative depiction is precisely what distin- guishes the Diatessaron Entry scene from the usual represent- ation of this event.3 Long before I engaged in the study of the Diatessaron manuscript I had found it to be characteristic of the imagery of the earliest period of Christian art that it deliberately avoided the celestial setting in which the Church, once it had acquired supremacy over the other religions, was to illustrate some of its highest tenets. The main themes displayed on the earliest sarcophagi - the Good Shepherd, the reading Philosopher, the Fisher, Jonah asleep under the Terebinth - were all more or less typically "terrestrial" motifs. In the catacombs Christian art went literally underground, and indulged in depicting witnesses of faith longing to be rescued from their prison-like abode - Jonah from the belly of the whale, the Three Hebrew Youths from the furnace, Daniel from the lions' den and Noah from his boxlike ark. In other words, motifs showing one of the faithful enclosed in a narrow terrestrial site were particularly cherished: if in the Dura chapel the Resurrec- tion of Christ is represented by means of an enormous, hermetically sealed sarcophagus, not, as it was later, by an open aedicula - and without an angel guarding it - this, too, 1 Art Bulletin, xxII, 1940o, 270-72. 2 Christian Iconography.

Nor is any- thing present to indicate an extra-terranean setting in the representations of the agape of the faithful shown at table, in their not-yet-heavenly "waiting room," the refrigerium interim. The ceiling hangs low, as it were, over the art of the earlier Christian centuries. Only in the course of the fourth century do we witness a gradual transfer of Christian art to the celestial settings previously occupied by the pagan gods - settings therefore an abomination to the believers in the time of the persecutions. Only after the battle had been won and the old inhabitants of Olympus had been reduced to shadows, then and only then did Early Christian art "grow wings," even literally so, as far as its angels are concerned. Consequently, in observing that in the Diatessaron cycle the Maiestas Domini was depicted not by Christ in Heaven, but by Christ at his Entry into Jerusalem as a worldly sovereign, and that the four living creatures appeared without wings and haloes as entirely terrestrial beings, it seemed to me - and I am still not willing to abandon this general view - that these miniatures should be interpreted as a remnant of the "pre-celestial" period of Christian art. However, the reaction to my suggestion that the whole cycle in the Florence Diatessaron might go back to Tatian's own lifetime has been, as I expected, overwhelmingly negative. Schapiro and his seminar students are not the only ones to have strongly objected to it. In a book on the iconography of Christ's Entry into Jerusalem, Erich Dinkler has devoted a separate paragraph to a refutation of it.4 The great master in the study of Early Christian art and liturgy, Theodor Klauser, has with the help of two assist- ants vouchsafed my paper a thorough review in Jahrbuchfiir Antike und Christentum, in which he raises all the objections I anticipated from him.5 It would no doubt have been wiser not to challenge anybody's opinion, and to rest content with calling attention to the conspicuous resemblance of three of the Diatessaron miniatures to those in the seventh- and eighth-century Hiberno-Saxon Gospel books, and this was in fact how I conceived and wrote my paper in its first version. In pushing my arguments quite a bit further, not only have I failed to convince the majority of my expert readers but, thanks chiefly to Schapiro's critique, I have now come to realize myself that the evidence brought for- ward is not strong enough to bear out the most radical of my conclusions. Consequently, I withdraw my thesis that the miniatures found in the Persian Diatessaron might ulti- mately depend upon a second-century archetype. This, then, would have been for my part the end of the story, had not Schapiro gone to the opposite extreme in his critique and endeavored to deny the miniatures in the Persian Diatessaron any greater documentary value in their relation to Early Christian art in general, and to Insular manuscripts of the seventh and eighth century in particular. In this he seems to me to lead the discussion astray. Since the whole problem as he presents it is of considerable methodological interest, I am grateful to the editor of The I Hanging bowl from Sutton Hoo. London, British Museum 2 Turkish brass bowl, 19th/2oth century, Sweden, private collection Art Bulletin for allowing me to come back to it once more and, having been challenged by Schapiro on this particular point, to add a few remarks concerning the marginal scenes in the Syriac canon tables and their possible relation to a similarly illustrated edition of the Diatessaron. I need not add that the primary purpose of my rejoinder is neither to try to defend at all costs my own position, nor to point out whatever mistakes Schapiro may have com- mitted in his argumentation, but rather, by taking advan- tage of Schapiro's critique, to try to arrive at a fuller clari- fication of the issue. II I should like to start by recapitulating briefly the lines of transmission which textually connect the Persian manu- script of 1547 with its second-century prototype.6 We do not know for certain where and when Tatian composed his Gospel harmony, nor do we know what language, Greek or Syriac, he used. Whatever the case, the Diatessaron had the remarkable success of being adopted as the authoritative 4 Der Einzug in Jerusalem.

At this time the Diatessa- ron not only became outmoded, but strictly forbidden, and copies that still existed were forcibly rooted out. Only in the remote parts of Eastern Mesopotamia did the faithful cling to the old tradition by keeping their Diatessaron manu- scripts, and they continued to do so after having come under Moslem rule. When we hear about the time-honored holy books which the surviving Christian congregations took with them when deported by the Mongols to the provinces south and southeast of the Caspian Sea, we have reason to believe that among those books there was a copy of the Diatessaron antedating the translation made by Bishop Rabbula. It was this book that a Jacobite layman from Tabriz, Iwannis 'Izz al-Din, turned into Persian towards the end of the thirteenth century, and it is from a copy of his translation that the manuscript brought to Italy by the Armenian Catholicos Stephen V, now preserved in the Laurentian Library in Florence, directly descends. This manuscript, then, could well hark back ultimately to the archetype of the Syriac Diatessaron via a small number of intermediary links. For it is otherwise hard to explain how such a late manuscript could have preserved so many good Tatianic readings. However, every text loses something in the process of being copied. I fail to understand how Schapiro could have gotten the impression (as he has it in his note I I) that I consider the Florence manuscript to be a "direct copy of Tatian's original text." On the contrary, I fully recognize with Father Messina that 'Izz al-Din did not slavishly follow his old Syriac model. He allowed himself both to re- arrange the way in which the excerpts from the four Gospels had originally been patched together by Tatian, and to make certain changes in the actual wording.7 It might even seem as if he had composed an entirely new Gospel har- mony. But the truth is, as Father Messina has shown, that he did depend upon Tatian, although he does not even men- tion his name. Similarly, the miniatures, as we have them in the Florence codex, cannot be true copies in every respect - presuming that I am right in believing that they, too, descend from 'Izz al-Din's Syriac models. I do not think there can be much doubt about their being fairly accurate copies of those that illustrated the manuscript of 'Izz al- Din's translation on which the Florence text depends. But, just as the thirteenth-century translator was far from always respecting the wording of the Syriac harmony from which he worked, in the same way the artist he employed was not likely to feel himself constrained to render line by line the miniatures from which he worked. He cannot have avoided altering them here and there in order to adapt them to the style current in the place where he was active. I now regret that in my paper I did not go more deeply into this matter. However, with expert knowledge Schapiro and his seminar have undertaken this task and have provided a number of parallels, which alone make Schapiro's article a major con- tribution. To mention only one particular instance, in the page depicting the four symbols, the eagle of St. John has been transformed into a vulture. This, however, does not mean that the composition as a whole must date from the period when this change occurred. Another example is the yellow canopy symbolizing heaven, which has been added above the representation of Christ in the Entry miniature and again, even less organically, at the top of the page with the four symbols. It is clearly an interpolation, due either to the artist of the Florentine codex, or since he added little to his model, to the illuminator of the model itself. For the problem of the ultimate origin of these compositions, this canopy is, as I see it, of no relevance. Nothing could be more natural than that at a time when the "terrestrial" con- ception had long since lost its original meaning, the ap- parent strangeness of its imagery should be compensated for by the addition of such a motif. Schapiro quotes the early seventeenth-century drawings on which our knowledge of the Calendar of A.D. 354 chiefly depends as an example of the possibility that a late antique cycle of miniatures might survive in a copy more than a thousand years younger than its archetype, although he does not believe that this could also apply to the Diatessa- ron manuscript of A.D. 1547. In the case of the Calendar drawings, however, no late medieval intermediate link inter- vened which would necessarily have distorted the original composition. A more relevant parallel is provided, in my opinion, by the copies of the jotitia dignitatum and its illus- trations made when a Carolingian version of the fifth- century original was brought to the attention of the human- ists at the Council of Basel. In them we can clearly see to what extent the still essentially late antique style of the Carolingian model was affected by the Gothic style of the copyists, with the result that a certain number of details in the costumes and the settings were brought up to date. Nevertheless, even through these distortions the fifth- century archetype is still apparent. Whenever a cycle is transmitted by a series of copies, a number of details are left out or added, yet the basic idea of the composition may survive relatively intact. Both the Calendar of 354 and the Notitia dignitatum might be cited as parallels to the Diatessaron miniatures, granted that Stephen V of Armenia might also have been enough of an antiquarian to appreciate the Diatessaron miniatures as a document of considerable importance for anyone inter- ested in the early history of the Church. However, I have become more and more sceptical myself that this might have been the reason why this unique cycle of miniatures should have survived in the copy of the Persian Diatessaron ordered by the Armenian Patriarch. Antiquarian interest is not the only way for very old themes and images to survive in the history of art. Already in the time of Tatian, the Mesopotamian border regions of Syria where the Dia- 7 In the first-mentioned respect all the copies of Tatian's Gospel harm- ony are greatly at variance with one another, to such an extent that it seems almost impossible to say anymore exactly how Tatian originally fitted the excerpts from the Gospels together. To judge from the Dura fragment, which is the only copy likely to have kept his original arrange- ment, it seems to have been a mosaic with finer tesserae, if I may say so, than the medieval versions.</page><page sequence="4">TIHE DIATESSARON MINIATURES ONCE MORE 535 3 The Evangelist Symbols, The Persian Diatessaron.

That is precisely why the Diatessaron could be preserved there after it had been abandoned in the more progressive parts of the country. The same conservatism caused the Christians deported to Iran to keep their sacred old books, until the time came when these were no longer understandable to them and therefore had to be translated into Persian. At that moment it would have been natural for them to wish to preserve, at least in the form of copies, the holy images found in the old copy of Tatian's Gospel harmony. Unlike the text, the images could be enjoyed as they were, whatever the language with which they were connected. This kind of traditionalism runs, as everybody knows, like a red thread through all the history of Oriental art. With its continuous chains of survivals and revivals it surprises us again and again by producing motifs and ideas which one expected to have been dead and abandoned for centuries. This is particularly evident if the appearance of old Oriental motifs in Western art as well is taken into account. From the research of Baltrusaitis and others we know that a great deal of the ornamental fauna of Roman- esque art had its ultimate roots in Sumerian art from which it appears separated by millenia.8 I cannot resist calling attention to a similar possible relation between West and East by reproducing side by side the great hanging bowl found in the ship burial of Sutton Hoo (Fig. I) and a piece of Turkish brass (Fig. 2), probably not earlier than the beginning of this century, and of a type which is still currently manufactured. Inside both, attached to a pin in the middle of the bottom, is a fish which can be 8 J. Baltrusaitis, Art sumerien, art roman, Paris, 1934. V.

I am sure that Schapiro will choose to consider this curious similarity fortuitous, since his easy dismissal of resemblances is a major trait of his treatment of a part of the Diatessaron problem to which I shall have to return. However, it may well be that the unique motif of a movable fish in a Celtic hanging bowl is better explained by assum- ing some kind of influence from the East, whose origin and way of transmission escape us, but which can at least be hypothesized on account of the striking parallel furnished by the Turkish bowl. But back to the Diatessaron. Although I no longer claim that the colophon miniatures in the Florence copy are reflections of a cycle created under Tatian's own eyes, I do think that the cycle originated before the Diatessaron was dethroned from its position as the normative service book of the Syriac church, that is, some time before the middle of the fifth century. In order to sustain this thesis, I must first say a few words about the composition of the cycle as a whole as we have it in the Florence codex - a point that is not touched on at all in Schapiro's critique. The impression that the cycle evokes is that of a carefully thought-out set of images bound together by a common idea. At the beginning there is an introductory page resembling a prayer carpet, featuring the oldest and most sacred of all Christian symbols, the cross. At the end we find the cosmo- graphic scheme supported by the four Evangelist symbols, emphasizing the divine origin of the Gospels, which are likened to the four rivers flowing with honey, milk, wine and oil in Paradise. Between these two miniatures is a double page having on one side the four Evangelists and on the other an image of the Lord shown at the moment of his terrestrial triumph. As in some Syriac lectionaries, the ass in the latter miniature moves from right to left instead of from left to right, as is normally the case. This anomaly cannot have anything to do with the fact that both the Persian and the Syriac scripts are read from right to left, for in some Syriac lectionaries the ass is turned in the usual way. It is more likely to have been caused by the fact that the artist wanted Christ to be turned towards the four Evangel- ists on the opposite page, ordering them with his raised right hand to fulfill their high task. From the point of view of content the cycle would be appropriate not only for a Diatessaron, but also for a normal Gospel book. The question is, which of the two does it fit better ? Since it is unique in the whole history of illumina- tion, there is no other example that can assist us in the decision. The crucial miniature is no doubt the last one, with the four Apocalyptic symbols surrounding the Paradise diagram. It has only one and not very close parallel in Eastern art, the miniature in the Munich manuscript, of A.D. I280, of Qazvini's Cosmography in which the four symbols have wings and appear thoroughly Moslemized. However, since they occur there in a non-Christian context, it does not help us to solve our special problem. On the other hand, similar compositions occur in a number of Latin manuscripts, all of them Gospel books. Is this an indication that it was originally created for this type of manuscript ? I do not think so, on the following grounds. In a ninth-century Gospel book from Fleury preserved in Bern, Stadtbibliothek Cod. 348, there is a miniature (fol. 8v) depicting the four symbols which obviously copies an Early Christian model.9 Except for the eagle which is given in full-length, it shows the symbols as busts with wings and haloes. Its place is at the end of the canon tables from which it has borrowed its arcade frame. It is clearly a colophon page to the numerical Gospel harmony by Eusebius of Caesarea which, as is well known, became the final solution to the harmony problem and thereby estab- lished the victory of the fourfold Gospels over any composite Life of Christ. There is also at the beginning of the Book of Durrow, as Schapiro reminds us, a full-page miniature with the four symbols enclosed in four squares around a cross division.10 They deviate from the symbols usually placed in front of each Gospel by not being full-length creatures, but busts. Consequently, we must look for a different model for this page, and I have proposed that such a model might have existed in a manuscript of Juvencus' Historia evangelica, a versified Life of Christ composed in the time of Constantine the Great, who is glorified at the end of the poem. A copy of this work existed on Iona, where the Book of Durrow is likely to have been made, in the time of Adamnan, who quotes it in his De locis sanctis.11 Some copies, including the best and oldest one in Cambridge (Corpus Christi College Cod. 304) of the seventh century, contain at the beginning a fourth-century poem, probably not by Juvencus himself, in which the four symbols are mentioned, and this poem recurs in an Irish Gospel book, Oxford, Bodleian Library Auct. D. 2.19, fol. I69v, each verse being set in a square frame, in the same way as the Durrow symbols.12 As in the Durrow Gospels the eagle is here connected with St. Mark and the lion with St. John - that is, the Irenean order obtains, which became anomalous after St. Jerome had sided with the order Mark-lion and John-eagle; thus, from this point of view also, a direct relation between the Juvencus manu- script and the Durrow Gospels is plausible. Consequently, we find the likeness of the four living creatures in the West connected once with a numerical and once with a poetical Gospel harmony. In other words, it functioned as a harmony picture, and this fits perfectly with the fact that we encounter it among the colophon pictures of a Diatessaron. The burden of proving it foreign to this context falls upon him who chooses to consider it an inter- polation, and I do not think that Schapiro has succeeded in 90.

Laur., Orient 8I, fol. 127 bringing home this rather essential point. In any case, he seems to share my belief that we have to do with a genuinely pre-medieval composition, "the one that most forcibly suggests an Early Christian model." I wish he had elabor- ated on this excellent idea, by trying to determine when, where and for what purpose it was originally invented. Schapiro astonishes me when he says that "what moti- vated Tatian in composing a single Gospel narrative from excerpts of all four was not just the need to demonstrate the harmony of the four Gospels despite their discrepancies or to provide a small compact book, but the desire to produce a text that would accord with his own theological views." If that had been his main intention, Tatian would not have had to go to the trouble of fusing the four Gospels into one. It is well known that the idea of harmonizing the four Gospels was primarily a response to the pagan critics of the new religion who used the discrepancies between the Evangelists as a proof of their lack of trustworthiness.13 To this state of things the believers too were sensitive, so that the acceptance of four different Gospel texts as canonical had to be defended by all kinds of cosmological and other analogies, as we know from Irenaeus. Far from adding to 6 Cross-carpet-page, The Book of Durrow. Dublin, Trinity College Library, 57 (A.4-5), fol. Iv these difficulties, Tatian's Diatessaron eliminated them effectively. His Gospel harmony was furthermore the ideal tool in the missionary work of the Church, and I do not doubt that the success which it obtained at first, not only in its Syriac version but in other languages as well, finds its main explanation in this fact. It also accounts for the existence of the Diatessaron in a number of early medieval vernacular translations, which go back to the period of the conversion of the Teuton and Slavic tribes east of the Elbe. In his desire to detach the miniatures in the Florence codex from the Diatessaron text to which they actually belong, Schapiro goes so far as to deny that Tatian ever associated his work with that of the four evangelists from which it derives. "Nowhere in an author's preface or a head- ing of the text is the reader told that the work is a harmony of the writings of the four Evangelists or a text excerpted from them." However, the very title ro 8t' -EoUodpWov (that is to say, EVayydAtov) - as distinct from the confusing title diapente attached by Victor of Capua to his version of it - is quoted by Eusebius of Caeserea in his Church History as the title of Tatian's work and no doubt his own, and can after all only mean [one Gospel] "through four." Both terms, 13 On this issue see H. Merkel, Die widerspriiche zwischen den Evangelien.

"14 It is true that everything would have been much clearer had Tatian provided his Gospel harmony with a preface explaining its purpose and function. Unfortunately Messina abstained from translating the preface that exists in the Florentine codex on folios Iovoff. Here, however, not only are the four Evangelists mentioned twice, and the places where they wrote and their different languages, but also the four living creatures of the vision of Ezekiel are said to refer to the four Gospels.15 The order in which they are mentioned - the lion, the bull, the eagle and the man - is not that of Ezekiel, but that of the harmony miniature read counter- clockwise from top left. "The promised coming of Christ among the Israelites" is also referred to and is said to have taken place in Jerusalem, "the navel of the world," which may have a bearing on his Entry into Jerusalem. At the end the author of the preface explains his work, speaking in the first person: "Each separate Gospel does not give a complete account. I brought everything that is in the four Gospels together without losing anything." One wonders who this "I" is. The statement is repeated when 'Izz al-Din later on explains why and how he translated the harmony into Persian. Since Messina does not make a case of it, he must have assumed that the whole prologue was written by the translator. On the other hand, some parts of the preface could as well, and perhaps even better, have been written in the Early Christian period. Could it be that 'Izz al-Din, if he is the author, made use of a preface found already in his Syriac model? In one of the passages the author digresses with a diatribe against philosophy. It seems astonishing enough for a Jacobite Persian living in the thirteenth century, and it immediately brings to mind Tatian's own Oratio ad Graecos. There is also an attack on astrology, said to be good only for the prediction of eclipses. "All true science is in the Gospels." Again a statement that could have flown from Tatian's own pen. Schapiro takes me to task for having overlooked "a basic feature of medieval book illumination: the connection of image and text" (p.498), because I did not associate with the miniature of the four evangelists the four short texts about them which were added in Arabic on the penultimate leaf of the manuscript, followed by the colophon on folio 130, also added at the order of an otherwise unknown Bishop Anthony. Far from having disregarded these texts, I had them translated before I wrote my article, and from their florid language I immediately realized that they were late poetical paraphrases of the prologues which are sometimes found in Greek Gospel books.16 They contain nothing that would fit the archaic appearance of the portraits of the evangelists, which in any case had already been executed when these prologues were added. Had there been such a connection of image and text, the prologues would have been in the same language as the rest of the book and not in- cluded as an afterthought. They may have been added at the same time as the double page with the Moslem ara- besque, which I suspected was a sort of laisser-passer, a hypothesis which has been confirmed by Jacques Guilmain's truly ingenious reading of its hidden inscription.17 If any of us has overlooked a possible connection between the text and the illustrations it is Schapiro, who apparently is not aware of the far more important fact that both the evangel- ists and their symbols are indeed referred to in the actual prologue to the Diatessaron, as explained above. Schapiro stresses the fact that the coordination of the symbols and the evangelists is different in the Hiberno- Saxon Gospels and in the Diatessaron. Yes, it would indeed have been nice had there been complete conformity on this point! However, since the order found in the Diatessaron is unique and the Books of Durrow and Echternach are at variance not only with the Diatessaron but also with each other - the former following the order of St. Irenaeus and Juvencus, the latter that of St.Jerome and Western art in general - this is evidently not a point on which one could expect full consistency between related manuscripts. What really matters is the striking formal agreement between the symbols in the Diatessaron and the Echternach codex, which is not affected by their attribution to one or the other of the evangelists. Schapiro's standard of conformity is simply too high to be historically relevant. The same holds true of the paradisiacal rivers and food- stuffs. Schapiro draws attention to the fact that the order used in the Diatessaron agrees with that in the Syriac version of the Apocalypsis or Visio Pauli - one more reason, I would say, for assuming that 'Izz al-Din's artist did not invent the diagram with the four living creatures, but took it over from the old Syriac Diatessaron from which the Persian translation was made, just as he faithfully repeated the names of the evangelists in estrangelo script in the miniature with the holy four standing under arcades. I wonder, however, if Schapiro is not too rash in drawing the conclusion from the above-mentioned agreement that the diagram page could not be older than the fifth century, the date given by him to the Syriac translation (other scholars think the fourth century equally possible). For there is no 14 F.

A complete literal translation of all the prefatory matter in the Florentine codex is a real desideratum. 16 To prove my point, it is sufficient to quote here, in the French trans- lation I owe to the kindness of Pater Raes, at that time prefect of the Vatican Library, the first of these texts: "Preface pour l'evangile de Matthieu. Le mieux qu'il y a pour purifier les coeurs des souillures, pour pardonner par la predication et la moralite les pech6s des hommes, pour rdprimer par les defenses de la predication les passions des sens, celui dont les commandements et les prohibitions sont accept&amp;s ouvertement et respect- ueusement [literally 'sur les yeux et la t&amp;te'], c'est le livre, utile pour la vie, gage du salut, jardin des disciplines des v6rites, promenade des intelligences des creatures, la rapport6e dans l'annonce de celui qui forme les esprits et les intelligences, l'dlu dans le groupe des publicains, l'ap6tre Matthieu qui annonce et dit." Apart from the fact that the end of this text seems to presuppose the Gospel of St. Matthew as following immediately (which it naturally does not in the Florentine codex), I defy anyone to find any relation between this balderdash and the simple pictures in our manuscript. 17 "A Note on the 'Arabesques' in the Diatessaron, Florence, Bibl.

Even more uncertain is the connection between the Irish "Pseudo-Jerome" and the Latin version of the Visio Pauli. In this case Schapiro's table of comparisons contradicts his own statement. We get the following quite divergent systems: Visio Pauli (Latin) Pseudo-Jerome Gihon-Oil Gihon-Honey Phison-Honey Tigris-Milk Tigris-Wine Euphrates-Oil Euphrates-Milk Phison-Wine Even the order in which the rivers are quoted is not the same, so that if we apply to Schapiro's own paper the standard of agreement he uses to criticize mine, there is no parallel at all. Unless the eighth-century author of the Pseudo-Jerome commentary treated his source in cavalier fashion, the idea of matching the rivers and the foodstuffs with the evangelist symbols is more likely to have reached Ireland from another source, still to be identified.19 III Since I no longer claim that the miniature cycle in the Florence codex can be proved to hark back, in some of its characteristic features, to the time of Tatian himself, the real issue now is whether it has an Early Christian prototype or whether, as Schapiro tries to demonstrate, it is a late medieval creation. The main obstacle to his thesis, as he is well aware, are the close analogies between the evangelists, their symbols, and the cross-carpet-page on the one hand and the corresponding motifs in the Hiberno-Saxon Gospel books of the seventh century on the other. To this I will come back soon. The cycle also includes, however, a mini- ature for which there is no immediate parallel in the Insular manuscripts, namely the Entry of Christ into Jerusalem; the question is whether or not I was right in saying that this too presupposes an Early Christian model. Schapiro does his best to discredit my arguments in favor of it, and thereby comes out with an interpretation of one of its most striking details, the double-cross nimbus, which I, for one, find highly subjective. It is a commonplace that a geometric figure can be read in different ways, according to how we think it has been composed. A square, for instance, can be seen as two angles joined at the extremities of their legs, or as a "U" form with a stroke on top, or again as two horizontal and two vertical parallel lines united at their ends. With respect to the two crosses in the nimbus of Christ in the Entry miniature Schapiro claims that they are not two crosses, but a single one, namely the Byzantine patriarchal cross with a long transversal arm below and a short one above, the latter representing the title-board which Pilate ordered to be put up with an inscription saying that Christ was the King of the Jews. Although this was meant by Pilate to be derisive, Schapiro thinks that in our miniature the short stroke could be understood as a positive reference to Christ's Kingship, which was revealed by his triumphal Entry into Jerusalem - an exceedingly sophisticated interpretation hardly applic- able to an artist whom Schapiro describes as simple-minded and provincial. However, Schapiro fails to quote a single cross-nimbus shaped like the one in the Persian Diatessaron. He mentions all sorts of representations of the patriarchal cross on Byzantine coins and reliquaries, in depictions of Christ carrying such a cross staff in Resurrection and Anastasis scenes, all of which have the obvious disadvantage of not being in any way enclosed by a nimbus. He also calls atten- tion to a Byzantine representation of Christ with a patri- archal cross breaking through the outline of the halo around Christ's head, to a cross with the title-board tangent to the nimbus, and to a transparent nimbus set against a real cross with a title-board above the head of Christ. However, none of these examples has any real resemblance to the design in the nimbus of Christ in our miniature. Much simpler is the explanation I have already offered, namely that we have here a conflation of the ordinary cross- nimbus and the more unusual representation of Christ with a small cross surmounting his head with or without a nimbus, undoubtedly in use in Early Christian art.20 Our miniature, of course, is not the only medieval example of a revival of it. A striking parallel is, to be sure, the relief with the Entry of Christ into Jerusalem on the door panel from the Coptic church of Sitt Miriam (al-Mo'allaqa), now in the British Museum, which I ought to have quoted in my first paper, not only because of the small cross above Christ's head, but also for its general resemblance to our miniature (Schapiro's Fig. 3). Here we can be sure that no patriarchal cross can be brought in as an explanation of the crosslet since the main cross has the form of five radial bands derived from the Christogram nimbus, another Early Christian type of halo. Again, then, we have a typical example of a conflation, and again, as Schapiro points out, only in the panel depicting precisely the same scene as our miniature, which can hardly be accidental. In other words, there must have existed a tradition, exemplified by our Persian miniature and its thirteenth- century immediate model on the one hand, and by a Coptic relief not far removed in time from the latter on the other hand, of representing Christ at his Entry into Jerusalem having a small cross above his head. I still hold that, even 18 R. P. Casey, "The Apocalypse of St. Paul," Journal of Theological Studies, xxxIv, 1933, 15. 19 The most complete treatment of the quaternitates, combined with the Gospels, in Insular thought and art is R.

He discusses the paradisiacal foodstuffs and their different coordination with the Evangelists in Pseudo-Jerome, Pseudo-Isidore and the Expositio quatuor evangeliorum, by an unknown Irish commentator of "sec. VIII, third quarter, if not later," but does not call attention at all to their evident relation to the Visio Pauli, either because he is not aware of it, or more likely because he does not consider it relevant. 20 I am grateful to Schapiro for having reminded me of the head-crosses on two lamps from Alexandria, which were originally attributed to the 3rd century (because of their types), but which Schapiro now places in the "fifth or sixth century," his usual terminus ante quem non for any Early Christian parallels to the Diatessaron miniatures.</page><page sequence="9">540 THE ART BULLETIN 7 The Holy Ghost Descending from the Hand of God, "Bookmark" miniature in the Etschmiadzin Gospels.

In my opinion the small head cross is not, however, the only feature in the miniature which clearly points back to an Early Christian model. Challenged by Schapiro's criticism, I must re-examine the composition as a whole at the risk of repeating myself. My thesis was, and still is, that there were two ways of interpreting the Entry into Jerusalem in art. The most usual way by far was to depict the event with as much action as possible - with people receiving Christ at the gate of the city, with the apostles following, with youths enthusiastic- ally spreading garments in his way, etc. Whereas all these details were taken from the account of the event in the Bible, none of the Gospels mentions the boys climbing the trees. It appears only in the apocryphal Acts of Pilate, a text which for that reason Gabriel Millet believed to have been the source of inspiration for the artists. However, already in A.D. 333 the pilgrim from Bordeaux was shown outside the gate of Jerusalem, the arbor palmae de qua infantes ramos tulerunt,21 that is to say, at a time when, according to the common opinion of the art historian, the theme had hardly begun to be rendered at all in sculpture or painting. In any case, this motif is seldom missing in the usual narrative scenes, although there is normally only one tree represented with one or two boys breaking off branches from it. In contrast to this epic-dynamic type, which I exemplified with the scene in the Codex Rossanensis, the miniature in the Diatessaron represents a static-hieratic type, with as little action as possible. Christ is seated frontally, immobile except for his raised arm. He is flanked left and right by two trees, in each of which is a youth also turned frontally who holds on with both hands to the branches rather than break- ing them. The function of the boys in the trees is similar to that of the apostles flanking Christ in the earliest represent- ations of his eternal Majesty, thereby corroborating that the Entry scene is really meant as a substitute for a Maiestas Domini picture. In its strictly symmetrical composition the Diatessaron miniature has no real parallel anywhere. But there exist conflations of this formula and the usual narrative type in Syriac lectionaries of the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries. To them should be added the previously men- tioned door panel from al-Mo'allaqa, which also shows Christ flanked by two trees. Schapiro prefers to explain the Diatessaron miniature as a reduced version of these con- flated types. "Remove [from the miniature in Brit. Mus. Or. 3372; Schapiro's Fig. Io] the other figures and we have a convincing model of the Diatessaron miniature." If this statement is meant to indicate how the miniature in the Diatessaron might actually have been painted, the least that can be said of it is that it is a typical writing-desk deduction, far removed from the practice of a medieval artist. The opposite development - the enrichment of the model common to both miniatures, by addition of the city gate, the youth laying down his cloak, and the apostles following Christ, all motifs borrowed from the usual narra- tive type - seems far more natural. If this is what actually happened, the type must be pushed back before the time of the translation of the Syriac Diatessaron into Persian, for the London lectionary dates from around A.D. I200. That this lectionary also presupposes a knowledge of the Diatessaron 21 P. Geyer, Itinera Hierosolymitana saeculi IIII-VII, CSEL, xxxix, Leipzig, 1898, 23-</page><page sequence="10">THE DIATESSARON MINIATURES ONCE MORE 541 tradition is brought out very plainly by the fact that, like most Syriac lectionaries, it contains "Passion harmonies related to Tatian's text" (italics mine). The quotation is from p. 507 of Schapiro's article, although the author fails to see the real implication of it. And that is not all. The Entry miniature in the London lectionary occupies only the upper half of the page, the lower being taken by the portraits of the four evangelists - as already pointed out by Abb6 Leroy, a most unusual arrangement.22 Schapiro overlooks the striking agreement with the double page in the Florence Diatessaron where the Entry and the four evangelists also appear side by side. In this case, however, the Diatessaron evangelists cannot be explained by using Schapiro's method of reduction, for the four evangelists in the London lectionary are seated be- tween curtains, whereas those in the Diatessaron are stand- ing under arches. Clearly the latter represent the more primitive type, which must have been abandoned in the lectionary version to conform with the more usual medieval custom of representing the evangelists seated, just as the Entry scene was brought up to date by the addition of the usual accompanying figures. The conclusion we reach is the following. There must have existed in the Syro-Mesopotamian region where these lectionaries were made a fairly widespread knowledge of an illustrated Diatessaron containing an Entry of Christ into Jerusalem with Christ seated hieratically on a donkey, mov- ing from right to left, and flanked by two trees, each show- ing a boy in its crown - basically the composition that fortunately has been preserved stylistically simplified, but fairly unchanged in its principal features, in the Florence miniature. The fact that this composition left its mark on the Coptic door panel as well adds further weight to our thesis that it goes back to the time prior to 'Izz al-Din's translation. Schapiro may be right in suggesting a Syriac influence on Coptic art. But it might also be that both the Syriac and the Coptic examples derive independently from a common Early Christian source. In the Syriac lectionaries the Entry into Jerusalem is fol- lowed or preceded by other feast pictures. In the Diatessa- ron on the other hand it is the only New Testament scene. My explanation for this is that it functions as a Maiestas Domini picture. Schapiro thinks that it is sufficient to associate it with the importance of Palm Sunday in the Syro-Mesopotamian Church which, he says, marks the opening of the liturgical year; he then uses this as an addi- tional argument for deriving the Diatessaron miniature from one in a lectionary. But he does not mention that the lectionaries of the Mosul School do not start with the Palm Sunday text, and the miniature illustrating it is thus not found at the beginning as a frontispiece, but inserted as a text illustration in the middle of the book. I know only one other manuscript in which the Entry into Jerusalem is placed alone at the beginning, as in the Florence Diatessaron, and that is the Armenian Gospel book from Hagabat, of A.D. 12 II (Yerevan, Matenadaran Cod. 6288), on which see Schapiro, page 509 and Fig. i 1. It should per- haps be determined first if this miniature always stood alone, as it does today, and did not originally form a part of a narrative cycle, the other images of which might have been cut out.23 This, however, was not my impression when I had the book in my hand. A close connection between Armenian illumination and our Diatessaron cycle is not surprising, since the evangelists standing under arcades have, as I already pointed out in my first paper, their nearest parallels in Armenian eleventh-century Gospel books. Schapiro has, correctly, I believe, called attention to the similarity be- tween the carpet-page in the Diatessaron codex and the decoration of the city wall in the Armenian miniature, although he does not draw the rather obvious conclusion that the artist may have had before him a Syriac manu- script with a similar carpet-page - the same manuscript from which he took the idea of using the Entry of Christ into Jerusalem as a Maiestas Domini frontispiece - in other words, a Diatessaron. The interpretation of the Entry scene as a terrestrial counterpart to Christ's final celestial glory is a concept current in the fourth century, as documented by the two central reliefs of the Junius Bassus sarcophagus. To these should be added as a contemporary Eastern example the sculptured wooden lintel of the Sitt Miriam (al-Mo'allaqa) portal in Old Cairo (not to be confused with the thirteenth- century door panels in the British Museum from the same church) to which Andre Grabar has recently drawn atten- tion and similarly interpreted.24 On the Roman sarcophagus the scene is also rendered in a very abbreviated form, which should have warned Schapiro not to take it for granted that the Diatessaron version necessarily reflects a similar tend- ency in late Byzantine art observed by G. Millet. The youths in the fork of the trees in the Florence miniature also come very close to the type used in the Roman sarcophagus. This to me is as obvious as anything could be. However, it is with what Schapiro rightly calls the "startling resem- blance" of the carpet-page and the Apocalyptic symbols of the Paradise diagram in the Florence Diatessaron with the corresponding miniatures in the Books of Durrow and Echternach that my thesis stands or falls. It was the dis- covery of this relationship that from the beginning induced me to write my paper; I thought, and still think, that even if my interest in the history of early medieval book illumina- tion had not so far added much to our knowledge, in this case there was really an opportunity to do so. For too long we have been content with drawing from the most varied works of art bits and pieces of parallels to the imagery of the great Insular Gospel books, as if those who created them, although they lived in some small monasteries in the northwestern outskirts of the civilized world, had a knowledge of Greek, Syriac, Egyptian, and Latin art through more than four centuries of which any modern scholar specializing in Early Christian art would be 22 Les manuscrits syriaques a peintures, conserves dans les bibliotheques d'Europe et d'Orient (Institutfranfais d'archeologie de Beyrouth, Bibliotheque archeologique et historique, LXXVII), Paris, 1964, 26If. 23 Professor Sirarpie Der Nersessian by letter kindly called my attention to this eventuality. 24 "Deux portails sculptes paleo-chritiens d'Egypte et d'Asie Mineure et les portails romans," Cahiers archdologiques, xx, 1970, i5f.</page><page sequence="11">542 THE ART BULLETIN envious. Particularly favored has been the assumption that they depended mainly upon Coptic art. Although I am far from denying the possibility that one or another Coptic work of art may have found its way to Ireland or Northumbria, I think that the fact that no such specimen has as yet actually been discovered in these regions should warn us against counting too much upon Coptic art as a source, at least a direct one. When the Florence Diatessaron presented me with a set of images immediately recalling those in the Hiberno-Saxon Gospel books, I thought that I had finally come upon the sort of precise evidence for which we had long been waiting. As often happens in such cases, I may have overrated the value of my discovery when I called the Diatessaron cycle the pillar on which Hiberno-Saxon illumination mainly rested. The problem is admittedly more complicated than that. But the fact remains, however, that the Diatessaron cycle constitutes a parallel to certain miniatures in the Book of Durrow and its followers that does not rest upon a mere detail or two, but is much more extensive and specific than anything that has so far come to our notice. First, the Paradise diagram page agrees in its representa- tion of the evangelist symbols with those in the Insular Gospel books by showing the beasts without wings and haloes (Figs. 3-4). Schapiro calls this merely negative evidence, as if the omission of those heavenly marks of distinction had no classifying value, but could have depen- ded only on the whim or the carelessness of the copyists. This was not the opinion of Ernst Kitzinger, who has the merit of having first pursued the matter thoroughly in his treatment of the symbols in Insular art.25 He recognized this type of symbol as being basically different from the usual representation of the four living creatures in Early Christian and early medieval art. What matters is not only that the wings and the haloes are omitted, but also - and this is not mentioned by Schapiro - that the creatures are rendered in full length, which cannot by any standard be called a negative criterion. Normally the Apocalyptic symbols appear in Early Christian art as half-length figures or busts. Sometimes we find only their heads emerging out of the wings, as in the Coptic frescoes. By having the lower parts of their bodies hidden, they were more effectively shown to be celestial beings. In the Coptic church there was even a feast in their honor named the feast of "The Four Incorporeal Beings."26 The rendering of the zoa, especially the two quadrupeds, as real terrestrial animals in full length is clearly opposed to this concept. When and where the "terrestrial" type was created is still an open question. But that it existed before the middle of the sixth century, when we already find it associated with the portraits of the evangelists in the mosaics of San Vitale in Ravenna, remains a fact, enough to guarantee that the symbols in the Persian Diatessaron of 1547 must date back at least to this period. I frankly cannot see why the occurrence of the full-length symbols in a miniature of Qazvini's cosmographic treatise, mentioned above, should "throw unexpected light on the history of the type," as Schapiro asserts. The simple truth, which Schapiro admits, is that they were taken from a Christian manuscript, and thus add nothing to the problem of their ultimate Early Christian origin. Compared to the sophisticated Qazvini symbols, those in the Diatessaron look in every respect more archaic and original, and therefore also much closer to the symbols in the seventh-century Hiberno-Saxon Gospel books. But supposing that Schapiro were right in denying a common ancestry for the Diatessaron and Hiberno-Saxon symbols, how should we explain the striking resemblance of the Diatessaron types individually to those depicted in the Epternacensis by an artist who, more than his predecessor of the Book of Durrow, was inclined to preserve their original appearance (Figs. 3-4)? Not only do we find in both manuscripts the symbol of man as a standing frontal figure with the arms bent symmetrically before the breast, but even the ornamental stylization of the garments in the Insular figure betrays a knowledge of the more naturalistic tripartite rendering of the garments in the Persian miniature. Schapiro, apparently blind to these correspondences, con- siders instead the symbol in the Echternach Gospels to be "surely based on an evangelist's portrait." It is the addition of a lattice-like throne behind the figure and of an open Gospel book in its hands that leads him to this conclusion. The standing posture of the symbol, however, militates against the assumption of a common model for the throne and the figure.27 As to the book, I cannot see how one could ever be quite certain whether it is an original part of the figure, which would have been omitted in the Diatessaron version, or - like the throne - an interpolation of the Insular artist. In favor of the latter alternative is the fact that both in the Diatessaron and the Insular cycles the other three symbols have no books. If in the Echternach codex the symbol of man holds a book, this is better explained, like the high-backed chair, as a conflation of the symbol of man and a real portrait of the evangelist himself. Both motifs already occur together in the Gospels of St. Augustine in Cambridge, as well as in its offspring, the Codex Aureus from Canterbury, now in Stockholm. That some influence from the south must indeed be taken into consideration in the Echternach codex is shown by the Roman tonsure of its symbol of man, another feature foreign to the Diatessaron figure.28 The similarity between the individual forms of the symbols in the Diatessaron and the Echternach Gospels is found also in the other creatures. Whereas in both cycles the ox and the eagle are seen at rest or moving slowly to the right, the lion is shown jumping in both (Figs. 3-4)- 25 "The Coffin Reliquary," The Relics of St. Cuthbert, ed. C. F. Batti- combe, Oxford, 1956, 229-41. 26 M. de Fenyol, Le Sanctoral copte (Recherches publiees sous la direction de l'Institut de lettres orientales de Beyrouth, xv), Beyreuth, 196o0, 85-86. 27 The combination of a standing evangelist and throne behind him in the Ostromir Gospels, referred to by Schapiro in his note 174, is a similar type of conflation, although stylistically far removed from the Echternach symbol. 28 It should be remembered in this context that Adamnan was the first abbot of the Celtic Church to accept the Roman custom of celebrating Easter, which he got some of his countrymen on Ireland to acknow- ledge, although his own monks remained opposed to it. See J. Kenney, The Sourcesfor the Early History of Ireland, I, New York, 1929, 283-87.</page><page sequence="12">THE DIATESSARON MINIATURES ONCE MORE 543 Can this agreement also be pure chance ? Schapiro does not comment upon it, but since he does not admit any connec- tion between the two cycles, this must indeed be his belief. He is more interested in pointing out that the coordination of symbols and evangelists is different in the Insular Gospels and in the Diatessaron, as if that were not exactly what we should expect, the teaching of the Western and the Eastern churches having in that respect taken different courses. IV I mentioned above that it was the agreement in types between the symbols in the Diatessaron codex and in the Echternach Gospels that first made me aware of their common ancestry. I did not know at that time that the resemblance between the sixteenth-century Persian codex and the seventh-century Hiberno-Saxon Gospel books was not limited to the symbols. Only when I actually saw the Diatessaron manuscript did I realize immediately that a no less astonishing similarity existed between the Diatessaron cross-carpet-page and that in the Book of Durrow (Figs. 5- 6). It is most regrettable that the Echternach Gospels, which in its symbols comes so close to the Diatessaron, does not have, like the Books of Durrow, Lindisfarne, and Kells, a carpet-page. Many points of disagreement between Schapiro and me would then have proved futile. However, the carpet-page in the Book of Durrow is revealing enough. There is, first of all, the use of the carpet-page per se. Its adoption by Moslem artists as a frontispiece to the Koran makes it probable that the Hiberno-Saxon miniaturists did not develop it themselves through a study of Roman floor mosaics (of which they, being located north of the limes, had little notion), but rather that they took it over from a Mediterranean model in book form. On this point Schapiro and I seem to be of the same opinion, since he, too, rejects Kendrick's suggestion that the carpet-page in the Book of Durrow could be explained by a reference to floor mosaics extant in Britain. New light was suddenly thrown upon this matter by the discovery, some twenty years ago, of a Coptic manuscript of the Acts of the Apostles, written about A.D. 400, now preserved in the Glazier Collection of the Morgan Library.29 It has a full-page ankh cross filled with multicolored inter- lace and placed, as a colophon decoration, at the end of the manuscript, similar to the miniatures in the Diatessaron. It is true that the interlace here fills the cross instead of forming a carpet-like background to it, but Harry Bober has demonstrated in his excellent analysis of the miniature how close its interlace patterns come to the earliest types of interlace found in the fragment of an Insular Gospel book in Durham, Cathedral Library A.II.Io, which, as is now generally recognized, antedates the Book of Durrow.30 This may well represent the carpet-page in an embryonic form, typical for Egypt, whereas the fully developed type with the interlace in the reserve space outside the cross may have been a Syriac invention. In any case, this is the form under which it must have been transmitted to the British Isles. Second, the layout of the carpet-pages in the Diatessa- ron and the Durrow manuscripts is basically the same; it consists of a central field with a cross, the whole surrounded by a broad border area, which is left undecorated in the Persian copy and is filled with bands of interlace in the latter, but in both restricting the central panel to a little more than half of the entire picture area - an arrangement which was abandoned in the latter Insular carpet-pages. Third, and this is what immediately strikes the eye, the design of the cross is in both manuscripts left in reserve and consists of stepped crosslet squares at the intersection and the ends of the arms, the stepped crosslet squares showing a darker small square in the middle - a specific and manifold agreement such as is seldom found between two miniatures of completely different origin. How similar the two carpet- pages are becomes particularly evident if one compares them both with the corresponding panel in the Syriac Borgia manuscript, illustrated in my first paper. For in the latter the main cross already emerges less distinctly from the background, although as Schapiro rightly remarks it approaches the Durrow page more closely than does the Diatessaron cross by having longer arms connecting the stepped end squares. Fourth, both in the Diatessaron and the Book of Durrow there are extra squares with fine interlace fillings set in the background between the cross arms. These, then, are the manifold agreements in the use, layout, and particular motifs of the cross-carpet-pages in the Diatessaron and the Durrow manuscripts, and again, Schapiro does not hesitate to consider them entirely irrelev- ant. To that purpose he takes great pains in order to point out in detail the differences which do indeed exist between the two compositions, so far from one another in time and space. But that, naturally, does not prove that they could not have a common prototype. In point of fact, only their having so much in common lends meaning to the analysis of what differentiates them. Realizing this, Schapiro goes to great lengths to try to persuade himself and us that what they have in common could, in the case of the Book of Durrow (Fig. 6), be the outcome of an independent Western development, the growth of which, he says, "can be followed in successive Insular works." He postulates this by presupposing that the carpet-page of Durrow "was probably [sic] preceded by sparser, simpler forms in earlier Insular works that have disappeared" - a way of reasoning that comes suspiciously close to that he accuses me of following in other contexts. He thereby fails to tell us what these earlier stages really looked like in the manuscripts and how far back in time they might go. The Durham Gospel book, already mentioned, which predates the one from Durrow, does not yet know the carpet- page; yet it can only be separated from the Book of Durrow by one or two decades. The fact is that the carpet-page appears suddenly in the latter manuscript, as a brand-new idea, due to the influence ofa model not previously available. 29 H.

Lowe in Codices latini antiquiores, vI, 1953, pages x and ii, 2nd ed., 1972, No. 147-</page><page sequence="13">544 THE ART BULLETIN That this model should have been produced in the British Isles as the outcome of an internal development for which there is no manuscript evidence, is entirely unlikely. Neither the small crosses on the Canterbury coins, none of which shows the characteristic crosslet squares of the Durrow and Diatessaron page, nor any other crosses predating Durrow elsewhere allow us to imagine the preliminary stage in the development of the carpet-page postulated by Schapiro. To account for the double arms of the Durrow cross, Schapiro again has recourse to the Byzantine patriarchal cross, which has previously served him, with doubtful success, to explain the double-cross nimbus of Christ in the Entry miniature of the Diatessaron. This derivation would otherwise seem to be impaired by the very objection which he raises against my assumption that the oblong field would have caused the doubling of the arms; in other words, why was the cross in the Durrow page not designed in exact conformity with the Byzantine model, with the vertical section under the lower transverse arm prolonged in the manner of the real cross on which Christ died ? As a matter of fact, the derivation of the Durrow design from the patriarchal cross is a hypothesis in which he him- self does not seriously believe. For when he analyzes the difference between the Diatessaron and the Durrow com- positions, Schapiro arrives at a conclusion which contradicts his previous assumptions, namely, that it is "uncertain that the main figure of the Durrow page was conceived as an emblem of the sacred cross" at all. What we see would be a figure, only apparently resembling the Christian cross, cut out for purely ornamental reasons from an overall pattern of crosslet squares connected vertically and horizontally in the manner of a continuous grid. If that be the case, it is difficult to understand why the artist should have joined the squares together in the vertical direction only along the central axis. It is also most unlikely that a Christian artist decorating a Gospel book with a design closely resembling a cross should have done so without attaching any emblem- atic meaning to it. It cannot be by chance that the cross- carpet-page occurs only at the beginning of the book, where the Mediterranean model, used by the artist, is also likely to have had such a symbol. Only when the Hiberno-Saxon illuminator decided to add carpet-pages at the beginning of each Gospel and at the end of the whole book as well did his model not provide him with examples, and for these he had therefore to resort to his native, originally pagan, repertoire of ornamental designs. It is true, as Schapiro points out, that the cross-carpet-page has a certain superficial resemb- lance to the grid pattern on the gold clasp from Sutton Hoo (his Fig. 25), but one has only to put the two side by side to realize immediately that the interpretation of the Durrow panel as something more than just an overall ornament is really inescapable. But why go on arguing when what finally matters is not this or that specific point, but the entire "startling resemb- lance" between the decoration of the Florence Diatessaron codex and that of the Hiberno-Saxon Gospel books? Schapiro tries to defend his thesis by recalling that in two languages the same word can have the same meaning and yet derive from entirely different roots. No doubt in art history, too, we have to be careful not to be too rash in drawing conclusions when two works of art resemble each other closely. However, the parallels that can be found between the Diatessaron codex and the Insular Gospel books are too manifold to lend themselves to a comparison of this sort. By examining each point of resemblance sep- arately, I have counted over twelve specific instances of agreement, most of them interrelated in a meaningful way. In deliberately brushing aside so massive an evidence, Schapiro makes me think of one of those clever lawyers who are able to defend a client however guilty he may be. Against his very learned, very intricate and sometimes very far-fetched argumentation, I prefer simply to rely on my own eyes. Schapiro starts his critique by saying that my article of 1968, would, if convincing, radically affect certain of our ideas about the beginning of medieval art. I would not go that far, although I see what he means. However, it is not my article that could motivate his statement, but the new material itself. We need only look without prejudice at the parallels illustrated in Figures 3-4 and 5-6, to which should be added the agreement between the types of the standing evangelists in the Diatessaron and those in some eighth-century Irish Gospel books, already illustrated in my first paper.31 I believe the evidence speaks sufficiently for itself. Should all this prove to be the deception of the Devil, we all had better abandon the study of art history. How- ever, for my part, Schapiro's critique has not as yet brought me to this, perhaps healthy, decision. Having abandoned the idea that the Diatessaron cycle goes back to Tatian's own time, I no longer see any reason to suppose that the knowledge of it might have been brought to the British Isles already in the time of the earliest missions, to which Tertullian refers in his treatise Adversus Judaeos.32 It seems more probable that in one way or another a copy of an illustrated Diatessaron reached Iona only about the time the Book of Durrow was made. Under the Abbacy of Adamnan (679-704) a pilgrim by the name of Arculph on his way home to Gaul from the Holy Land was driven by a storm to the northwest shores of England, and found a refuge on Iona.33 From his (Arculph's) dicta- tion Adamnan wrote his book De locis sanctis which contains so much factual and legendary information about the countries along the Eastern coast of the Mediterranean, from Constantinople to Alexandria. When describing the churches in Palestine Arculph drew plans of them on a wax tablet which Adamnan had transferred to the parchment as illustrations to his text, a direct indication of the fact that the art of book illumination was practiced in Iona in his time. For once, then, we have a real historical connection between a place where Hiberno-Saxon art flourished and the Near East, and it is extremely tempting to assume that 31 Art Bulletin, L, 1968, figs. 6, 7, 9. 32 Cf. ibid., 139. 33 P.

Yerevan, Matenadaran 2374, fols. 49v, 96 and I6I the illustrated Diatessaron was among the books in Arculph's baggage. It is, of course, nothing but a hypothetical idea, but one that could explain the striking resemblance be- tween the Persian and the Hiberno-Saxon miniatures better than anything else. V It remains now for me to take up the gauntlet thrown down by Schapiro in the matter of the marginal scenes in the Syriac canon tables and their relation to a similar method of illustration in the Diatessaron manuscripts that preceded them. I am happy to be offered this opportunity as it was my original intention to give an account of my findings concerning this issue as a postscript to my first paper, although I refrained from doing so because I found the article already rather long. I should start by pointing out that I never claimed that such marginal illustrations would have accompanied the Gospel harmony of Tatian right from the beginning, al- though, as will be shown below, this is not entirely out of the question. The necessary prerequisites for their coming into being existed in any case as soon as the Diatessaron came into general use as the service book of the Syrian Church. It also goes without saying that a cycle as rich as that found in the Rabbula Gospels of 586 cannot have existed in the margins of a Diatessaron manuscript many centuries earlier. Even the more limited cycle in the somewhat older Paris Gospel book (Bibl. Nat. syr. 33) is not likely to have been taken over scene by scene from a Diatessaron, say, of the fifth or fourth century. The real issue is whether or not marginal illustrations in the two Peschitta manuscripts owe their existence to an earlier tradition in Syriac book illum- ination which, in that case, is most likely to have arisen in connection with Tatian's Gospel harmony before its re- placement by Bishop Rabbula's new translation of the four Gospels, with the canon tables of Eusebius added to it. This seemed to me so much more likely, since both the accept- ance of the Diatessaron as a canonical Gospel book and the marginal scenes of the canon tables in the Peschitta are features peculiar to the Syrian Church. The drawback of this theory, when I presented it thirty- five years ago in my book on the late antique canon tables, was that I could not substantiate it by having recourse to any Diatessaron manuscript actually adorned with this type of marginal illustration. Now the Persian codex in Florence has provided the evidence required. For, as acknowledged by Schapiro, this manuscript does indeed contain such an illustration, namely a dove painted in the margin at the place where the account of Christ's Baptism begins (Fig. 9). Marginal scenes can have two functions.34 They may serve as a pictorial commentary referring to ideas not directly expressed in the text, as in the Byzantine Psalters of the so-called monastic type. Or they can be straightforward illustrations, in which case their purpose is to assist the reader in locating more easily certain events or sections in the text which he would otherwise find only by perusing pages and pages, because at the time there was no foliation or division of the text into numbered chapters. An example of the latter type is provided by the marginal illustrations probably added in the eleventh century to the Etschmiadzin Gospels of A.D. 989 (Yerevan, State Library Cod. 2374).34a Alternating with the chapter numbers, added 34 K.

Since they function as a sort of bookmark, they are drastically abbreviated and consist mostly of one or two figures, enough to indicate to the user of the book the passage to which they refer. Thus, the Baptism of Christ is reduced to a dove descending from the hand of God (Fig. 7). This same configuration recurs in practically identical form in the Rabbula canon tables, where, however, the figures of Christ and the Baptist have been added as a result of the further development towards more pictorial vignettes characteristic of all the scenes in this manuscript (Fig. 8). This parallel would imply that the marginal scenes in the Etschmiadzin Gospels also ultimately derive from an illustrated Diatessaron; there is nothing un- likely in this supposition, since we know that the Armenian Vulgate translation of the Gospels retains a nucleus of very old readings taken over from an earlier version, which is thought to depend upon Tatian's Diatessaron.35 If the dove in the Florence Diatessaron differs from that in the Etsch- miadzin codex by being shown in profile rather than from above diving down with spread wings, this is due to the fact that in the Florence manuscript the hand of God from which the dove descends is not depicted. The conclusion would seem to be that the dove in the Persian Diatessaron repre- sents an even more primitive type of marginal illustration than that in the Etschmiadzin Gospels, being entirely emblematic rather than scenic. In other words, it is a perfect example of the image-sign, which Grabar considers charac- teristic of the very beginnings of Christian art. Indeed, it brings to mind the engravings on the stones set in sealing rings, which Clement of Alexandria, shortly after A.D. 200, thought appropriate for a good Christian.36 The Etschmiadzin Gospels have painted in the margin at the beginning of the pericopes of the Entry into Jerusalem a palm tree, and nothing else (Fig. io). The two principal Eastern translations of the Diatessaron, the Persian and the Arabic, differ from one another according as they rely on different Gospels for the episode of the people cutting branches from the trees. The former uses the text of Matthew 21 :8 and specifies further that the people cut olive branches, an emendation undoubtedly inspired by verse I of the same chapter, where Christ and his disciples are said to have descended from the Mount of Olives at Bethphage.37 The Arabic translation, on the other hand, is more elaborate by adding also John 12:13, where the branches carried by the crowd are said to be taken from palms.38 In the miniature representing the event in the Florence codex the tree to the right of Christ can only be a palm tree, whereas the shape of that to the left has less resem- blance to a palm - whether it is meant to be an olive tree is hard to say. In the Etschmiadzin codex, on the other hand, there is little doubt that the trees are palms. And this is not all. I do not think it has been noticed so far that in the center of the crown there is what looks like a small bottle (Figs. I oa-c). It can only be a representation of the pith of the palm, the point out of which the young branches start to grow, which still today is considered a delicacy for its soft and juicy substance. This detail, which to the best of my knowledge is not known from any other representation of the Entry into Jerusalem, finds its explanation in the text of the Arabic translation of the Diatessaron, for in this it is said that the people took "the heart" of the palm.39 This apparently genuine Tatianic reading turns up again in the West and, of all places, in Ireland, in the earliest manuscript of the Gospels written in Irish script, the Codex Ussherianus Primus, of the early seventh century.40 Consequently, the palm trees in the margins of the Etschmiadzin Gospels derive from a Diatessaron having this reading. Independent of the images in the margins of the Syriac canon tables, they constitute one more element in support of my assumption that Tatian's Gospel harmony was at an early date provided with bookmark vignettes. Schapiro asks me how I can reconcile my assumption that the marginal miniatures in the Syriac canon tables go back to an illustrated Diatessaron with my further assump- tion that the full-page miniatures in the Florence manuscript would also have been created for a Diatessaron. My answer is simply that the Florence codex shows that they could exist together. I hold the marginal illustrations to be the older system. The addition of full-page colophon pictures presupposes a demand for more richly decorated service books. The cycle must have enjoyed a certain popularity since we find traces of it both in the East and the West. There is no reason to assume that it made the marginal illustrations superfluous.
