BETTS INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS 104 1984,360 pp. Cloth Dfl. 140.00/US$ 53.50 ISBN 90-247-2923-8 Deism coupled the assertion of a belief in God with a denial that anything beyond this belief was necessary in religion. Thus, it contradicted the views of both the atheists and the Christians. Elaborated in various ways, it was a widespread and pervasive attitude in the literature of the Enlightenment and is directly connected with the secularism of the present day. This study explains and defines the religious ideas of the precursors and creators of French deism, especially in the formative period from 1700 to 1715. Its origins and early history in France are complicated by the denigrations of orthodox opponents and the hesitant, oblique or secretive modes of expression which deistic writers employed. The term 'deiste' itself always needs close scrutiny if the confu- sions which have beset the subject are to be avoided: it tended to mean whatever its user intended it to mean. The corpus of French deist writing dating from the first fifteen years of the eighteenth century, much of which was clandestine, provides the author with a firm basis for generalisations about the nature and origins of French deism. As a result of this - the first complete study to be undertaken of this corpus, - the positions of early writers such as Veiras and Foigny are defined. ill MARTINUS NIJHOFF PUBLISHERS §111 A Member of the Kluwer Academic Publishers Group »^: ■^■1 P.O.

RUDAVSKY 1984,300 pp. Cloth Dfl. 140,-/US$ 54.00 ISBN 90-277-1750-8 SYNTHESE HISTORICAL LIBRARY 25 This book is divided into an introduction and three specific parts, dealing with Islamic, Jewish and Chris- tian writers respectively. Within each of these parts, the chapters are arranged in historical order. The book starts by introducing the issues of divine omniscience, omnipotence and future contingents. Next, the issue of contingency is raised, taking Boethius' commentaries on Aristotle's De Interpretatione as the basis for discussion. The following three chapters are devoted to the Islamic setting of omniscience and omnipotence and the work then moves on to the formulations of Jewish philos- ophers. Among the subjects dealt with are: Maimonides' discussion of providence, divine omniscience and omni- potence; and the implications of Gersonides' theory of divine omniscience with respect to phrophecy. The next section deals with Christian philosophical positions, developing the problem of divine omnipotence and surveying the development of the notion of omnipotence in the early Sentence literature. Among the last chapters of the book is one that analyzes the views of Thomas Aquinas and Henry of Ghent with respect to divine omniscience. Contents Editorial Preface. One: Introductory.

BONDESON, H. TRISTRAM ENGELHARDT, JR., STUART F. SPICKER, and DANIEL H.WINSHIP 1983, xxxii + 349 pp. Cloth Dfl. 79,50 / US $ 29.50 ISBN 90-277-1493-2 This volume brings together philosophers, physicians, lawyers, theologians, and basic scientists in discussions of the meaning of personhood, the moral status of the fetus, and the ethical issues raised by abortion. By assessing the current biological data and the history of the law's response to abortion within the context of ethical con- cerns, the book offers an in-depth study of one of the cardinal issues in bioethics and the philosophy of medicine. In addition, by examining abortion in the light of general issues concerning the status of the fetus, it provides useful analyses regarding in vitro fertilization, and fetal research. 'This is a valuable new addition to the moral and legal literature on the juridical and moral status of the fetus. These essays go directly to the center of the debate and advance our understanding of the issues more than any book on the subject in the last decade. TOM L.
