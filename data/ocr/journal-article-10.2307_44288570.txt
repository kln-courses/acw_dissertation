<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Strange Landscape of the Ancient: Environmental Consciousness in "The King of Trees" Gang Yue* Ah Cheng's "The King of Trees," a novella published in 1985, marks the earliest moment of awakening the environmental con- sciousness in post-Mao Chinese literature.1 While nature promi- nently figured in the cultural landscape of the 1980s, in most instances it was inscribed as an anthropomorphic image laden with the intellectual anxiety for re-imagining China's past. In this kind of symbolic appropriation of nature, the natural environment is hushed into a mere setting for the cultural imaginary. Exemplary in this culturalist subsuming of nature is the metaphor of "roots," employed to circumscribe the literature of "searching for roots" and Ah Cheng's work. This paper is aimed to disentangle the ma- terial "roots" from the immediate cultural politics. Environmental consciousness, however, is not located out of history, just as the search for ancient "roots" is always an act of remapping the contemporary social landscape. The theoretical context that informs and motivates my reading is marked with a profound irony. Environmental theory as it has evolved in the past three decades - with its scientific bastion in ecology and life sci- ences and with its philosophical foundation in environmental eth- ics and ecophilosophy - is by and large a Western intellectual enterprise.2 Since the West has taken the lead to conquer and pol- * Assistant Professor of Chinese, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 1 Ah Cheng, "Shuwang," in Qiwang shuwang haiziwang (Taipei: Haifeng chuban you- xiangongsi, 1992); Ah Cheng, "King of Trees," in Three Kings : Three Stories from Today's China, trans.

It is to be noted that ancient Chinese thought, art, and literature, among other "Oriental" and "indigenous" cultures, have served as one of the main symbolic (re) sources of inspiration for many leading thinkers of Western environmentalism.3 Whether or not they have romanti- cized the "rest" is another issue. The fact remains that the Chinese went through many crises in their interaction with nature, evi- denced by one of the longest documented histories with a vast body of records. The ideal of human-nature harmony in ancient Chinese thought should be taken as a serious response to the ac- tual human-induced damages to the environment.4 If the environ- mental disasters in ancient China reflect ignorance rather than outright conquest of nature, the lessons drawn from them have much to offer the world. What is absent from the discussion in environmental theory, however, is the present China. With a few exceptions, most environmental literature on contemporary China comes from policy-oriented international and governmental agen- cies, nongovernment organizations, and the mass media. While aimed at solving "real problems," policy-oriented analyses are often complicated by global geopolitics. The recent debate on "Chinese environmental threat" is a case-in-point.5 For these reasons, this tant player in environmental theory because of its multidisciplinaiy strength. See Karen J.

The environmental crisis is global in scope, but the theoretical interven- tion has to start from somewhere. Hence the story of trees. Nature-Narration in the Cultural Landscape of the 1980s It is difficult to know where culture ends and nature begins, especially in a country like China in which the millennial human activity has left its footprint upon almost every facet of the natural world. But it is not as difficult to see their borderline in the works by zhiqing - "educated youths" who were relocated from the urban areas to the vast hinterland and the frontiers during the Cultural Revolution. Ah Cheng was such a zhiqing writer, and his major works in the 1980s deal with this experience. This section is a brief introduction to that particular genre. Most zhiqing authors wrote about nature with a poignant sense of ambivalence. For these young writers, the initial mission was to receive "re-education" from the peasants, joining them in the trans- formation of the world. They were sent off as soldiers to battle Heaven, Earth, and class enemies. But it turned out that the humans toiling in the back country were neither fit for radical ex- periment nor a source of enlightenment. As the youths encoun- tered the harsh reality in rural China and the stoic survival of the peasants, they were also brought face to face with natural wonders. Vast prairies and loess steppes, endless mountain ranges with rivers carving out deep valleys and fertile basins, and old rain forests boasting one of the world's richest naturili habitats - all these would be an ideal land of unlimited inspiration for poets, artists, and naturalists. Yet there was little romance awaiting them. It is only upon their return to the cities after the Cultural Revolution that the young writers came to terms with the traumatic experience of the past. The sense of lost youth features prominently in the "scar literature" (also translated as "literature of the wounded"), named after the short story "Scar" by the zhiqing writer Lu Xinhua. As wounds began to heal, zhiqing literature entered its second phase of what has been called "literature of retrospection," from which the movement of "searching for roots" eventually emerged, becoming the prevailing voice of nature-narration. The images of nature and the "native" were re-deposited with a more positive layer of meaning when writing itself became a pathway toward re-</page><page sequence="4">April 1998] ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS 71 membering the lost youth and salvaging its idealism. Just a few years after the young writers returned to the cities, they found themselves estranged from the bustling and crowded urban space as much as they had previously felt displaced into the backward countryside. Youth may be wasted in the sense that the teenagers could have had the formal education were it not for the Cultural Revolution. But the youths were enriched by their encounters with the rugged way of life in the world of primitive simplicity. What is reinvested in the natural landscape now is a sentimental nostalgia. That is why the distanced past was called back with a poignant sense of yearning. Many of these writers reminisce their past. For example, Kong Jiesheng longs for "the southern coast" of the tropi- cal Hainan Island where love and trust triumph.6 Zhang Manling cherishes the memory of "the beautiful place" in the rain forest of Xishuanbanna were the colorful Dai culture has nurtured intimate friendship and awakened romantic desire.7 Shi Tiesheng relates his story in "that remote Qingpingwan of mine" on the wide open Loess Plateau that sees dignity and decency prevail over abject pov- erty.8 Liang Xiaosheng revisits "this magical land" on the vast plain of Beidahuang where idealism is salvaged from the tragic history.9 And Zhang Chengzhi traverses the "northern rivers" from Central Asia to the Sino-Soviet border regions in the Northeast that once nurtured his big heart and heroic spirit.10 The mere reference to a few representative works does little justice to their authors, but it does sketch out a geographical China as projected from the youth- ful search and collective memory. Those writers' retrospective yearning would recall the romantic stories by Shen Congwen, the leading writer of "native-soil litera- ture" from the 1930s, who was rediscovered and emulated by young writers in the early 1980s. Although the kind of sentimental quest for "home" can be found in both Shen and many zhiqing writers, the latter refuse to let go of their unabashed faith in the real place. Their retrospection is different from Shen Congwen's "imaginary nostalgia," a phrase David Wang uses to characterize the profound 6 "Nangfangde'an" [The coast of the south], Shiyue 2 (1982). 7 "Youyige meilide difan" [There is a beautiful place], Dandai 3 (1982). 8 "Wode yaoyuande Qingpingwan" [The remote Qinpingwan of mine], Qingnian wenxue 1 (1983). 9 "Zheshi yipian shenqide tudi" [This is majical land], Beifang wenxue 8 (1982). 10 "Beifangdehe" [River in the north], Shiyue 1 (1984).</page><page sequence="5">72 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE STUDIES [Vol. 5:68 sense of existential displacement in Shen's "native-soil" stories.11 To the extent that Shen Congwen could not presume the actual return to the idyllic way of life in nature, the picturesque scenery in his writings - the mythical Western Hunan - preserves the space for his utopia-in-writing just as it defines his writing as an imaginary project. By contrast, zhiqing writers are not sons and daughters of the "native soil;" they are urban youths who have the cities to call home and return to. The "native soil" is not theirs to "lose;" so they believe that the past can be rediscovered as reality, not simply remembered in writing. The desire to rekindle the extinguished flame of youth is tantalizing. But it also determines that their writ- ing must bear the burden of representing truth beyond the textual- ity of their stories. As a result, the more retrospective their writing is in exploring the meaning of nature, the more introspective it becomes in their superimposing the self-image upon the mirror of nature. The next logical move is to dig out the roots of an authen- tic Chinese culture in the rediscovered native land. What was depicted as a natural landscape in the earlier phases of zhiqing literature now looms large as an ecological setting for the "literature of searching for roots." But the ecological setting is glossed over with an even thicker layer of symbolic sedimentation. The point is not that nature and culture can be separated. Rather, the natural world in "roots literature" remains a dormant yet formi- dable force on the level of signification, only to set off the over- whelming desire for hermeneutic probing into the cultural depth of the land. As the roots-digging intensifies, the material environ- ment begging for ecological interpretation is once again hushed back into a mere "natural background" of silence. An apt example can be found in Zheng Yi's novel, "The Old Well."12 The fruitless digging of over thirty deep wells by generations of the villagers calls for critical scrutiny toward the question of "environmental deter- minism" - a bad term in Western social sciences, though. In fact, water and dragon, the most important natural resource and its sig- nifying cultural icon in the agrarian civilization of ancient China, are centrally configured in the textual system of nomenclature. This weighty system of cultural symbolism runs through the land- scape from the Purple-Dragon Mountain where the water deity is worshiped, to the Purple-Dragon River that bypasses (and thus con- 11 See his Fictional Realism in 20th-century China (New York: Columbia University Press, 1992), pp. 251-53. 12 "Laojing" [old well], Dangdai 2 (1985).</page><page sequence="6">April 1998] ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS 73 demns) the village of Old Well, to the given name of the hero, Wangquan or "welling spring." But the palpable specter of environ- mental degradation is activated only to flesh out the story's dual themes on the villagers' persevering survivalism (which the author admires) and their fatal ignorance and tribalism (which he de- spises). If there is an environmental logic at work, it is redirected toward the culturally-meaningful endeavor in digging the well, not at the depletion of water and the ecologically-meaningless act of digging in the first place. Unfolding against this silent backdrop of nature is a parable of the nation, as heroic as it is tragic. A further step would lead one to examine the changing land- scape with its shifting colors, visualized in the ground-breaking film Yellow Earth (1985) directed by Chen Kaige and the influential TV series River Elegy (1988). Though here is not the place to elaborate on the visual production of natural landscape in cinema and televi- sion, I would briefly point to the intensified cartographical act in rewriting the national space in these two works. Embedded in the deep layers of "yellow earth" is the myth of the "yellow race"; de- posited in the thick sediments of the dragon-like Yellow River is the painful memory of the Dragon King's descendants. Nature now stands for a grand museum of cultural history that exhibits the in- tellectual disorientation of contemporary China. In River Elegy, the solution is said to be "re-orienting" China to the West, symbolized by the Yellow River's flow into the "blue water" of the Pacific Ocean and its eventual merge with the "other shore." Among many other cultural landmarks of contemporary West, the dazzling image of the postmodern Los Angels best captures the fantasy of the Dragon King's descendents. Yet River Elegy offers no reflection of any sort on the environmental and social costs if China were to transplant the massive network of superhighways from southern California. It is, indeed, ironic that nature-narration began with the painful memory of the "wounds," shifted to the "retrospective" sentimen- talism and nostalgic search for "roots," and ended up in the radical repudiation of every hue of "yellowness." Perhaps history should not be presented as a linear narrative as my sketchy description may lead one to believe. From green to yellow to blue, each color speaks for a particular history, and together they (and other colors such as "red" so beautifully mystified in the film Red Sorghum) con- stitute the spectrum of competing narratives. If the natural land- scape is overloaded with cultural meanings, the question is not to unload it from such a historical burden. Instead, it is by dissecting</page><page sequence="7">74 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE STUDIES [Vol. 5:68 that strange cultural landscape that the environment will resurface in its own "natural" shape. In the Dark Shadow of the Blazing Sun Set on a remote mountainous farm in China's southwestern border region, King of Trees depicts the slashing and burning of "useless" trees in the tropical rain forests. The deforestation is part of a massive development project for growing "useful" and lucra- tive crops. Transformation of nature, however, is not just moti- vated by economic gains. Destruction of the old to build the new is a central tenet in the Maoist theory of socio-historical transforma- tion. Ah Cheng embeds the story in this "grand narrative" but qui- etly tips the focal point toward the ruins of its "progress." The story can be read, first and foremost, against the textual and contextual logic of the solar metaphor in modern times. The zhiqing generation may always recall what Chairman Mao expected of China's youth: "The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours. You young people . . . are the bloom of life, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you."13 As the rising sun in the New China, the youths were educated to carry out the revolution that had begun with the rise of Mao, himself now the "beaming sun in the hearts of the people." It is in that glorious aura that the everyday life started with the ritual chant: "Red is the East, and Rises the Sun; China sees the rise of Mao Zedong. He strives for the welfare of the peo- ple; he is our great savior." Just as the natural sun is the origin of energy, warmth, and light for the planet earth, so is the solar trope the source of revolutionary fire and enlightenment. Here, nature worship from an ancient agrarian culture is transformed into a political faith. Of course, the natural sun destroys as well as it nur- tures, only to confirm the human belief in its cyclical renewal of life, through death. But the solar trope in modern China operates not only in a general anthropocentric mode; it revolves specifically around the linear orbit of World History. The reference to the Hegelian-Marxian notion of historical pro- gress is a crucial subtext for understanding Ah Cheng's story from an international-ecological point of view. In his materialist rewrit- ing of the semantic of Hegelian idealism, Marx inherited the lat- 13 "Talk at a Meeting with Chinese Students and Trainees in Moscow," November 17, 1957, in Quotations from Chairman Mao Tsetung (Peking: Foreign Languages Press, 1973), p. 288.</page><page sequence="8">April 1998] ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS 75 ter's narrative syntax that stipulates a linear teleology of history. Pivotal to this syntax, as Derrida has so meticulously observed, is the metaphorical transformation of the natural sun into a "teleol- ogy of sense."14 As the signification of the natural sun hinges on the specular opposite of light versus darkness, the Hegelian meta- phor cannot shine or signify without designating its opposite to the dark image of "nature," human and nonhuman alike. But Hegel faces a difficult problem: civilization began in the East where the sun rises. To solve this metaphysical predicament in regard to the notion of "origin," he splits the sun into two distinct realms of meaning. On the one hand, the East is condemned to a stagnant cycle of forever repeating itself just as the natural sun spins around its cyclical orbit. On the other hand, when the sun travels to the West, it miraculously transcends its own natural cycle, staying put in its apogee that is the enlightened modern West. In place of the natural sun is the self-conscious Spirit, and superseding the cyclical self-perpetuation of the old civilizations is the teleological progress of History. Yet this "transcendental signified" in the Hegelian his- torical cartography is grounded on the Derridian notion of diffÃ¡er- ance. It is a rhetorical usurpation of the natural sun or a figurative transformation of it into a signifier for timeless Truth. Curiously enough, the solar metaphor in the discourse of high rationalism turns out quite "unscientific" in ecological terms: the Hegelian im- age of the sun becomes once again a traveling planet around the (Eurocentric) human world, a crucial yet invisible lapse to the re- verse of the Copernican theory. To historicize such a grand exer- cise and edifice, one only needs to situate it in the era of high colonialism and imperialism that saw the sun never set. For modern China to catch up with the modern West, it must first transcend its own "natural" cycle of "eternal recurrence." The point is not to dismiss, but to complicate, the historical progress that drastically changed the social landscape. Transformation of nature to partake in the glory of the Helio-god is what circum- scribes the ideological syntax of Maoism within that broad context of modernity, despite Mao's sincere opposition to international capitalism and imperialism. In Ah Cheng's story, the solar trope is deployed both as a visual signifier and the content it signifies. Li Li, a fervent revolutionary and the zhiqing leader in the story, 14 For both Hegel's original passage on the sun and Derrida's reading of it, see Jac- ques Derrida, "White Mythology: Metaphor in the Text of Philosophy," New Literary History 6:1 (Autumn 1974):71-73.</page><page sequence="9">76 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE STUDIES [Vol. 5:68 brought with him "a big wooden crate packed with his books." Packed in it was the canon of international Communism: Capital, Selected Works of Marx and Engles, Selected Works of Lenin, Selected Works of Mao Zedong, along with other revolutionary documents. "On the top of [the crate] a yellow sun was painted with rays fanning out, and around it in a semi-circle were the words: 'A vast land for mighty deeds'" (111/99), which is Mao's famous dictum for the zhiqing movement. Li Li's given name means "erection," corre- sponding also to the Maoist motto that destruction of the old pro- ceeds and gives rise to the erection of the new, known as bupuo buli. As the group of zhiqing settled in around a bonfire, Li Li stood up amidst the flowing sparks and scorching heat, declaring "our life of combat is about to begin" (114/103). After he felled the "the king of trees," he wrote something on a sheet of paper and pasted it on the book crate. It reads: "We Are Hope," reaffirming the hope Mao placed on the "morning sun" (153/145). With the Marxist- Maoist classics inside, and with Mao's calling and the youth's re- sponse painted or pasted around the image of the sun outside, the book crate simultaneously contains the content of History and dis- plays its specific form of signification. Erased from this densely se- miotic centerpiece is, first and foremost, the dense forest. That is why the ruins of history cannot but be seen in the wake of the blazing sun. Ah Cheng was writing in the mid-1980s, when the international green movement was yet to reach the vast land of China. Inevitably, the author had to tap into the world of ancient Chinese thought for inspiration. On the narrative level, the envi- ronmental consciousness emerges and evolves through an inter- subjective play between the I-narrator and the hero in the story. The I-narrator, a city youth that largely speaks for the author, is the "subject of enunciation," so his point of view is crucial to the devel- opment of a counter-narrative in the story. It is through his eyes that the reader comes to identify with the "enunciated subject," the story's main character named Knotty Xiao, the real king of trees as it turns out later. It is through their encounters that the destruc- tive flame of the blazing sun is re-cast, so to speak, into a different light. And their counterpoint to the solar trope is first established by their handling and viewing of Li Li's book crate. The crate is "loaded" not just in the symbolic sense; it is so heavy that "it needs four people to move it." When Li Li was await- ing other youngsters to help him unload it from a tractor, Knotty Xiao quietly carried it up all by himself "as if the wooden crate had</page><page sequence="10">April 1998] ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS 77 slid of its own accord onto Knotty's shoulders." Because Knotty looks rather small, his unbelievable physical strength leaves these youngsters "standing there dumbly, [their] hearts in [their] mouths" (110/98). Although Knotty was by no means aware of the significance of his action, it is nevertheless symbolic of the light- ness, if not total emptiness, of the crate. Of course, he will have to pay a high prize for his unwitting belittlement of the Book. The implication of his act, however, did not escape the narrator. As the narrator was wondering aloud about the initial encounter between the "loaded" crate from the outside world and the mysterious na- tive who "unloaded" it single-handedly, he looked at the crate as if it were "a curious monster" (111/99). The image of the sun is, after all, a painted political icon. Shin- ing as it may look, it won't radiate without being shined upon. The visual color and shape of the image relies upon what light is cast on it, that is, in what light the viewer interprets its meaning. If the crate looked like "a curious monster," it is because the narrator was trying to make sense of this heavy piece in "light" of the small, shadowy figure of Knotty. By the same token, when Li Li unlocked it to display the weighty stuff inside, it was shown in the light of a small oil-lamp, a sign of backwardness in this remote corner of China that nevertheless cast its weak glow back on the painted sun. Such an optical counterpoint is later literalized in the narrator's act of book-reading. Except for Li Li's collection of the revolution- ary canon, the only book we come across in the story is a picture book about Song Jiang killing his wife, a well-known story from Water Margin. With the first and last pages missing, the picture book embodies a historical memory without "beginning" and "end," in the form of cartoons whose caption the child (Knotty's son) does not read. It is a book of difference, one that differenti- ates an ancient mythology of cyclicity from the teleological pro- gress of the painted sun. As the narrator puts it, "in this dim lamplight, it seemed like a remote memory. It struck me that the past few years of Revolution had been exhausting, while this old story of murder was like an unhurried ballad that let people relax" (139/131). By anchoring the narrative tension on an optical spectrum of conflicting and competing signals, the story paradoxically es- tranges the visual icon of revolutionary modernity and shifts its glory into its own shadow. Hinged on this bifurcating yet entan- gled symbolic structure is not only the invasion of the political sun</page><page sequence="11">78 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE STUDIES [Vol. 5:68 into the hinterland, but necessarily the expansion of power unto the natural world of the "savage." Physically, shadow is created by light as its dark opposite on the periphery; metaphorically, it exists as the latter's "out-cast." If modern conquest of nature as it has developed in the colonial history is at the same time a process of the conquest of the indigenous peoples and cultures, nature and the native are invariably inscribed as the Other in the discourse of enlightenment. To tell the stories of the Other is to retell it from the point of view of nature and the native.15 An environmentalism- inspired writer cannot undo past damages. What he or she can and must do is lending an empathetic shape and voice to the otherwise shadowy and silent Other, human and non-human alike. The significance of Ah Cheng's story lies precisely in this counter- narrative. Of course, the natural sun is only a huge "ball" of burning fire. As the image of the sun is split between the transcendental mean- ing of progress and the natural phenomenon of self-perpetuation, so is the fire between a symbol of revolutionary fervor and an in- strument for primitive survival. The bonfire that inspired Li Li's combative spirit was set up and kept alive by Knotty. Yet when Li Li was making his combative pronouncement, the narrative shifted to Knotty and cast him in a dark shadow. "He was beyond reach of the firelight, but his small, round figure was silhouetted in the moonlight." Once the fire changes into a political signifier, the narrative counterpoint must shift, too. As the narrator was staring at the flames yet unable to echo Li Li's heavy-handed preaching, the fire "conjured endless fantasies and mysterious ideas in [his] mind," leading him "backward" into the dawn of civilization. Act- ing on his impulse to leave the now politicized firelight and take a walk in the purifying moonlight, the narrator finds himself alone with Knotty, both standing at the foot of high mountains and gaz- ing up the dense forest. The old-growth forest "looks like a goblin in the moonlight" with masses of wild animals finding their refuge 15 The reason I point out this counterpoint is not simply for textual analysis. I am wary of the theoretical blind spot and political narrow-mindedness in some Western envi- ronmentalists' neglect of the uneven development of the world, which is rooted in the history of colonialism and neo-colonialism. As a result, their articulation of protecting the environment (which often means protecting the quality of life of the First World) places disproportionate burden on developing countries and downplays the central problem of over-consumption in the developed world. For a third-world critique, see Ramachandra Guha, "Radical American Environmentalism and Wilderness Preservation: A Third World Critique," Environmental Ethics 11 (Spring 1989).</page><page sequence="12">April 1998] ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS 79 in it (114-5/103-4). This is the ancient habitat for both humans and animals yet to be touched by the fiery sunlight of modernity. In their brief conversation about the upcoming cutting of the trees, the shadowy figure of Knotty can only lower his head in the moonlight. Like the shivering glow of the small oil-lamp, the moon is, in the realm of nature and the native, what the solar trope is in the historical orbit of modern China. Of the five elements in ancient Chinese cosmology that make up the natural world, fire here is clearly the dominant force. It is usurped by the solar trope to illuminate the world of nature. As the fiery sun blazes the trail of destruction into the natural world of Old Heaven, we can turn to the other four elements - wood, metal, earth, and water - to see how the war of conquest is waged and resisted through their textual conflation and conflict. Bearing Witness to the Death of Old Heaven the environmental consciousness of the story comes alive most potently in its holistic depiction of trees as organic living beings. Their destruction is not going to happen without the resistance from nature and its native guardian. The first morning the group of city youths set out to survey the area, they were awestruck by the gorgeous view on the mountain top. The narrator "suddenly felt these mountains were like the convolutions of the human brain, it was just we didn't know what they were thinking" (118/107). When they turned to an ancient tree, "it turned out to be a colos- sus over three hundred feet tall, its branches spread wide, shading an area of over a hundred square yards." Yet there is nothing old about the bark: "a finger-nail was enough to expose the tender green." Touching it with his hands, the narrator felt "a throb warmly against the palm as if it had a pulse." Looking up from under the tree, he finds that "the blue sky looked almost black through the chinks between the leaves, and the dots of sunlight danced like thousand winking eyes" - a reference to the sun from the tree's "point of view" that will be called back later when the area is cleared. Dumbstruck by such a sight and feel, the narrator found his mind "completely blank" (120/110-1). Towering on the opposite summit is a solitary tree. It forms a world of its own and carries an aura of mystique in the eyes of local farm workers. They believe that it has become a "tree spirit"; even a farm leader testifies that he once tried to hack it for a while, only to find himself "feel queasy." Li Li, however, considers the taboo a</page><page sequence="13">80 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE STUDIES [Vol. 5:68 pure "superstition." As in the natural order of plant growth the new supersedes the old, so does in the order of human thought. To destroy the "tree spirit" is just a revolutionary act of uprooting an old superstition. But the tree can "talk back" as it falls, and it falls like a wounded giant. The narrator describes the felling of the first ancient tree like this: The great tree seems to have lifted its foot but was still up- right. . . . The sky had grown dark, and the branches and leaves formed a single black shape, blank and motionless - as though stunned. For a moment I was mystified, and then I heard two snapping sounds. . . . Then came three more cracks, then a fourth, but the tree remained motionless; only the leaves trem- bled a litde. . . . All of sudden there was a rending crack as if the mountain were coughing. The crown of the tree slowly began to move, but I felt as if the sky were tilting. ... As the crown moved faster and faster, leaves and twigs began to float down and the tree coughed as if gasping for breath. Suddenly the sky grew lighter (134/126-7). When nature coughed in pain, Knotty responded. If the fall of trees made the sky brighter, he would put his life on the tilting skyline to protect the shade. As if a tree and its shadow, Knotty rarely talks and always keeps a low profile. But when he does talk, it sounds like an outburst of heavenly rage. The battle reached the climax as Li Li set out to cut the "tree spirit" left alone on the mountain top - the one believed by the group of zhiqing to be the king of trees. On approaching it, the youth discovered the small figure of Knotty among its gigantic roots. After a moment of evad- ing Knotty's stern gaze, Li Li raised his ax. The quiet Knotty sud- denly spoke out with a strange gruff: "That's not where to chop, young man." "Where, then?" Li Li turned and asked him with some sur- prise, lowering his ax. "Here," Knotty raised his left hand to his right shoulder. "Or here will do," Knotty rose steadily to his feet and laid his hand on his chest (148/140-1). Posing himself like a tree trump to take the first cut, Knotty embodies the peaceful complement of wood and metal. He is the best logger on this farm, and his wood-chopping and knife-work are so exquisite that the city youths compare him to Cook Ding, the master hand at cleaving in Zhuang Zi. Yet following Cook Ding's natural way of non-confrontation, Knotty can only offer his</page><page sequence="14">April 1998] ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS 81 body up for the ax. As the real king of trees, he is determined to fall with the "tree spirit." His reason for leaving this ancient tree is as futile as the trees are perceived to be "useless": he wants it to bear witness to what Old Heaven has planted. For Li Li, that is precisely what revolu- tion is about: "Man is bound to triumph over nature. Did Old Heaven open up land for cultivation? No, man did, to feed him- self. Did Old Heaven forged iron? No, man did, to make tools and transform nature, including your Old Heaven" (149/142). A pow- erless individual, Knotty had no chance to reverse the formidable force of man so obsessed with transforming Old Heaven. Backed by the farm's Party Secretary, Li Li succeeded in removing Knotty and the "tree spirt." Afterwards the young revolutionaries set fire to the entire mountain. Here I would like to quote at length a few passages, beautifully written (and translated) but devastating in their impact. First, the tumultuous motion and sound: The fire grew bigger and bigger. Loud explosions broke out and the mountain began to tremble in the rising currents of hot air. . . . Suddenly there was a great bang, followed by a shrill of hiss. The fire twisted into a ball and then violently fell apart. As we watched, a big log leapt up and flew through the air, trailing a million sparks. It made a somersault and fell down again scatter- ing countless flaming torches. The bigger ones dropped; the smaller ones continued to soar thousands feet up, tossing and turning for ages before they slowly drifted down (154-5/147). Then comes this breath-taking picture of death: Suddenly Six Claws [Knotty' s young son] cried out shrilly. "Oh, a muntjac, a muntjac!" Hastily scanning the flames, I saw on the brightly lit mountain top a tiny muntjac darting back and forth like an arrow. . . . The fire was closing in on the summit. The muntjac finally came to a halt, kneeled down slowly on the forelegs and dropped its head. ... To our surprise, the creature suddenly drew itself erect, lifted its head to form a straight line with its neck, and slowly reared up on its hind legs. Before we realized what was happening, it charged like an arrow towards the fire, kicking up a string of sparks, and then, with a great leap, fell obliquely into the fire and disappeared in the flames. In that instant the fire swept over the top. . . . The apex of the flames licked the crimson sky. Finally I understood that I had never really seen fire or destruc- tion before, and knew even less of rebirth. (155/147-8) Finally, the universe explodes in rage:</page><page sequence="15">82 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE STUDIES [Vol. 5:68 The whole mountain was seething. Amid the flames, tens of thousands of big trees left the earth and rose to the sky. Just when it seemed as if they would fly away, they would slowly drift down, collide in mid-air, break up, soar even higher, then drift down again, then soar up again, up, up, up. . . . The mountain, which looked as if it wee scalded, rang with weird shrieks, a whole universe in panic. (156/148) In the middle of the deafening roar and white heat, the narrator heard Knotty saying: "It's cold. Oh, it's cold" (ibid.). The triumph of fire and metal over wood is devastating. Just in a matter of months, on his way to the county town, the narrator saw in the whole region "mountains denuded by felling, like badly shaven heads, totally unlike the scenery at the time of our arrival." As if to remind the reader of the solar metaphor, he notes that "the sun became particularly dazzling each morning" (141/133). Meanwhile, Knotty collapsed and soon died almost unnoticed. He was buried right at the site where the "tree spirit" used to stand. The night after his burial, it rained. It "came down in torrents and went on for a week," as if Heaven were shedding furious tears for the martyr. When it finally cleared up, the narrator saw some big trees not entirely burnt standing with their scorched black branches. "The black erect trunks with their charred branches looked like arrows from outer space which had plunged deep into the naked body of the mountain." On the summit, "Knotty Xiao's grave had burst open: the white coffin was raised high above the grave, gleaming in sunshine." As some of the bolder spirits ap- proached this ghastly scene, "it turned out that a tangled mass of shoots was growing vigorously from the earth," pushing out the cof- fin from beneath. These shoots grew out of the tree's far-spread roots, and they grew so extensively after being drenched with the week-long rain. The corpse had to be cremated, the ashes then re- buried on the same site. On the grave, grass was to overgrow with a kind of white flowers the local people believed to be medicinal herbs, good for curing cuts. To the narrator, however, this patch of white flowers look "like white bones exposed in dismembered limbs" (160-1/152-3). Such a densely symbolic ending begs detailed analysis yet defies its differentiating rationality. If Heaven cries, its tears are poured upon the denuded body of Earth, only to nurture the dismem- bered limbs to grow beyond the logic of life and death. When Earth is raped, it refuses to hide its fury and extends its most vigor- ous protest by opening its chest to raise its loyal servant above the</page><page sequence="16">April 1998] ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS 83 grave. The king of trees falls with trees, falling to the roots of his own, but he rises again to bear witness to the death of Old Heaven. Interwoven in this exquisite embroidery of natural imagery is the intrinsic interconnection of all life-forms. But it is a tragic and neg- ative confirmation of the principle of organic harmony. The only hope seems to rest with the wild flowers. These white flowers may indeed cure the cuts, hence nature will probably heal its wounds in the eternal renewal of life. But for those who have violated the principle of harmony, the flowers are white bones exposed on the ruins of history. The poet of a post-catastrophic elegy can only scat- ter the flowers around the grave, weaving them into a wreath to remember the dismembered. Searching for Roots in an Era of Uprootedness As indicated at the beginning of this paper, the reception and appropriation of Ah Cheng's work in the 1980s was driven by an collective anxiety to uncover the "roots" of Chinese traditions. Such an intellectual move of "searching for roots" was based on the assumption that a coherent body of Chinese cultural traits and es- sence did exist but was lost in the "cultural ruptures" that began with the May-Fourth New Cultural Movement and culminated in the Cultural Revolution. To cope with the sense of loss and dis- placement, the task for contemporary Chinese writers and intellec- tuals was to reconstruct a national culture by reconnecting with that tradition. But the digging of "roots" within the parameters of national culture reproduces the same syntax of the preceding "grand narrative," replacing the totalizing model of an "imported" ideology with that of a re-imagined "native" tradition. Cultural re- construction itself is not the issue here; the wasteland left on the trail of the Helio-god makes reconstruction all the more urgent just as the scorched land needs more trees to be planted. The question is in what terms and for what purpose the reconstruction is carried out. What happened in the moments of "searching for roots" and the subsequent "cultural fever" - which we can see even more clearly now from the vantage point of the millennial turn - is the erasure of materiality and alterity in the name of national culture.16 16 See Gang Yue, "Surviving (in) 'The Chess King': Toward a Post-Revolutionary Na- tion-Narration," Positions : East Asian Cultures Critique 3:2 (Fall 1995).</page><page sequence="17">84 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE STUDIES [Vol. 5:68 If one is serious about uncovering the "roots" of Chinese cul- ture, one cannot do so at the expense of the roots of trees, nor continue to play into the ideological trap of metaphorical transfor- mation to the ignorance of ecological health. "The King of Trees" offers a clear picture for the material primacy of natural environ- ment. Even in comparison with Ah Cheng's two other stories about the "kings," "The King of Trees" is the most salient in taking "roots" literally, that is, ecologically. Cultural reading does not necessarily require the presence of written words, of course. The invocation of Cook Ding from Zhuang Zi, which might otherwise serve the purpose of digging out some roots of a great philosophical tradition, is made only to illus- trate the physical labor of chopping wood in accordance with the natural order of things. Cook Ding's masterful handling of the cleaver demonstrates that the use of human-made tools must al- ways follow the rules of nature rather than altering it in the image of man. In the same vein, Old Heaven, an obvious reference to folk religion or "superstition," does not reveal any "hidden mean- ing" so much as it is embodied in the dependence of humankind on the environment. If nature reveals anything, it is immanent unto itself: "these mountains were like the convolutions of the human brain, it was just we didn't know what they were thinking." As pointed out earlier, Ah Cheng's treatment of the Other is marked with a narrative shift toward a "non-anthropocentric" ap- proach that highlights the "intrinsic value" of nature. While this is not the place to elaborate on these philosophical concepts, it suf- fices to say that our reflection on nature is "anthropogeneric," that is, generated by human interest. But that does not necessarily pre- clude the possibility to foster genuine understanding of the natural environment and protect its health. "To think like a mountain" (Aldo Leopold's words) and recognize its "intrinsic value" presumes certain form of human consciousness (anthro- pogeneric); yet paradoxically it is not centered on humans at the same time. It is true that "the subaltern cannot speak," just to bor- row from the familiar vocabulary on the politics of the de-coloniza- tion of knowledge; it is also true that the Other "signifies" in her own terms with a history only invisible to the Self. To extend the same logic from human subalterns to other life-forms does not en- tail a leap of faith. We only need to return to the recognition that we are, first of all, large omnivorous primates among other species and organisms.</page><page sequence="18">April 1998] ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS 85 Ah Cheng's story also suggests a degree of skepticism toward the representation of nature, posing some serious question to ecophilosophy as well. In critiquing the anthropocentric enlight- enment tradition and its instrumental rationalism, environmental philosophers, especially proponents for "Deep Ecology," rely heav- ily on an idealist ontology in its claimed "paradigm shift" to a na- ture-centered epistemology and ethics. The ethos of environ- mental theory seems to be once again enmeshed in the persistent pathos of constructing the image of a(nother) transcendental Be- ing. The only difference it makes is the shift of the defining terms from the realm of Man to that of Nature. This theoretical anxiety to anchor the materiality of the natural world on a self-contained source of meaning should be situated in the mainstream tradition of Western thought despite the pronounced paradigm shift. Natu- ral phenomena still have to "manifest" something other than them- selves, whether it is the "divine design" in Romanticism or the "spirit of freedom" in its offspring of American idealization of the wilderness. In the name and process of contemporary philoso- phizing, ancient Chinese thought - notably philosophical Dao- ism - is turned into a transcendental philosophy of ultimate certainty. This theoretical certitude is ironically no less human- centered in terms of its faith in the human production of absolute truth, contrary to the principle of skepticism in Daoist epistemology.17 Moreover, ancient peoples were not always the idealized non- an thropocentric "deep ecologists." In Chinese mythology, for in- stance, the legendary warrior Yi, the hero believed to have shot down eight suns out of nine to save the scorched earth, represents one of the most daring acts of imagined human intervention. Ah Cheng's offering is simple and seemingly tautological: it is just that we don't know what nature is thinking because nature "thinks" in ways we don't yet know. Such a skepticism is based on, and in turn requires, an ethic of humility, patience, and responsibility. In short, the principle that underlies the environmental conscious- ness in the story is not a theological imperative of certainty, but a pragmatic recognition of difference. If this reflects a truly Daoist view of nature, so much the better. 17 For a more elaborated argument on a Daoist pragmaticism and skepticism, see R. P. Peerenboom, "Beyond Naturalism: A Reconstruction of Daoist Environmental Ethics," Environmental Ethics 13 (Spring 1991).</page><page sequence="19">86 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE STUDIES [Vol. 5:68 "Difference" is key to foregrounding the materiality and alterity of the text against the backdrop of the culturalist reification of the "roots" on the one hand and the theoretical simplification of the Dao on the other. But "difference," as the central concept that organizes the writing of the story as well as my reading of it, must not be bestowed with any abstract authority, either. It must be his- toricized as a concrete process of differentiation at a specific times- pace. Much as my reading is motivated by the double bind placed upon the text, Ah Cheng's novella was, above all, written at a time of historical uprootedness and social displacement. The leap, or fall, from the Helio-god to the metaphor of trees is conditioned in the shifting social consciousness from revolutionary fire to its deb- ris. If his trilogy of "kings" has been interpreted as "national alle- gories" about China's post-revolutionary condition, the very idea of searching for roots implies the state of already being uprooted. If, ideally, trees can be replanted, history is irreversible. It is in the strange landscape of the ancient that the sense of uprootedness most poignantly reveals itself. I have tried to avoid evoking the Daoist notion of ziren, "self-so," that has been (mis) translated to fit in the Western concept of "na- ture." For this notion has been so laden with the desire for totality that any reference to it may conjure up the picture of a paradise lost. Yet the modular chain in Laozi that governs the order from man to Earth to Heaven to Dao to ziren should be taken as a dialec- tic of harmony and alienation. Consequently, environmental writ- ing - the "mere" exercise of words - embodies the paradoxical pursuit, in concrete social context, for a Utopian return to the prin- ciple of ziren. If Knotty's coffin is pushed above the grave by the mass of overgrown shoots, his final return can only be realized through another round of burning when it is cremated to nurture the growth of white flowers. This is a classical narrative that at- tempts to reverse, in writing, the fatal process from harmony to alienation, from place to displacement, and from home to exile. For the very idea of harmony presupposes the state of alienation; only the displaced yearns to find a place to settle in; home symbol- izes a safe haven only for those already in exile or fearful of becom- ing homeless. Stranded in the strange landscape of the ancient, contemporary Chinese writers have no home to return to, except in constant re-imagination and reinvention of the present. Thus, the more one desires to find the home, the more imagination.</page><page sequence="20">April 1998] ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS 87 References Ah Cheng.
