The district is generally defined to include the valleys of the Bure, Ant, and Thurne in the north, and the Yare, Waveney and Chet in the south (Figure 1). This essay enquires into one element of Broadland; its moral geography.1 The bulk of the material is taken from the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century; the final section of the essay brings the story to the contemporary scene. The essay considers sailing, cruising, shooting, and birdwatching. Some comment is first due on the term 'moral geography'. I take the phrase from Driver's essay on nineteenth-century social science.2 Driver shows how the environmentalism of this science was at the same time a moralism: ' ' 'Moral science" was ... a science of conduct and its relationship to environment, both moral and physical'.3 This essay develops this theme of conduct, of different ways of being in the world and the reactions of others to them. Consider this in terms of 'land use', a seemingly innocuous term suggesting the mapping of types of farming, housing, etc. Trace the term back and it becomes clear that 'land use' is not simply a term of record. Dudley Stamp's 1946 summation of his Land Utilization Survey of Britain, The land of Brìtain , has the subtide 'Its use and misuse'. Land use is here a normative term, and as the work of Stamp and his contemporaries brings out, the use of land implicitly or explicidy encompassed the conduct of people in environment. Given the subject matter of this essay, it is worth elucidating this moral geography through the field of leisure.4 In 1944 J. A. Steers spoke to the Royal Geographical Society on his national coastal survey for the Ministry of Town and Country Planning. Surveying Norfolk, he had been angered by iong lines of jerry-built wooden erections', huts and shacks, constructed on bought-up plots over previous decades for residential or holiday use, often of ad hoc form and material, unbecoming to Steers' surveying eyes, 'hideous setdements'.5 These 'makeshift landscapes' often emerged on marginal land, edging fields, by the sea or on a river bank. Plodands became the focus for competing notions of property, freedom and control.6 Planners and preservationists contemptuously complained of the buildings and their people, of architectural individualism destroy- Ecumene 1994 1 (2) © Edward Arnold 1994</page><page sequence="2">128 David Matless Figure 1 ~ Map of the Norfolk Broads.

A planned public space could not accommodate this public. Steers concluded that the solution was to judge and guide pleasure and desire: The whole matter is basically one of geography . . . people have a great desire to visit the seaside, either in vast numbers . . . , or in . . . more manageable Ecumene 1994 1 (2) - ¿jhš&amp;zřW I äsä Uf fei ,^^Ml*0ùtX)H Frióte# j Pļp _ 'B&amp;- Z3m s ' Becdeífiorx tk t Rivtr ^ ^ßmw ' * ' ' 1norfolķ|rqadsJ TO ^ &lt;IhiBtätgrCcv$s 4s^ '</page><page sequence="3">Moral geography in Broadland 129 masses . . . , or as individuals on the remoter coasts. It is the last type of coastal region which is likely to become more and more popular in the right sense. Let us think of national authority as a coordinator and judge . . (my emphasis).7 Steers' moral geographical conclusions were echoed in discussion by voices prominent in debates over planning and reconstruction. W. S. Morrison, Minister of Town and Country Planning, commented how Steers 'not only gives us the facts, but proceeds by his paper to "point the moral" '8 Ecologist A. G. Tansley highlighted 'the enjoyment and refreshment of the people at large . . . Aesthetic appreciation . . . is . . . largely a matter of training. ... If we want our future citizens to value our national heritage . . . , it is up to us to see that the young get the necessary training'.9 Architect and planner William Holford lamented the lack of coastal 'architectural reticence': 'that is where Mr Steers paper is peculiarly valuable. It is saying: "You must care what you look like" '.10 And John Dower, who had travelled with Steers and would go on to oversee the establishment of national parks, praised Steers' ability to 'assess . . . misuse and disfigurement': 'when I have been asked to explain the functions of the Ministry of Town and Country Planning in which I serve, I have found the best short explanation is to say that our job is, or ought to be, creative geography'.11 The task of the creative geographer is to educate in proper pleasures, to channel healthy desires, and encourage a care for one's self and one's building. The correspondence of behavioural and architectural language - loudness, reticence, discipline, vulgarity - is no coincidence. An environmental ethos emerges which has embodied within it a model for the self, indeed this self can only be adequately formed environmentally. The themes of moral geography then are not new, although Steers et al. seldom paused in their confidence to consider the grounds of their normative and moralistic surveys.12 Let us turn to a more recent treatment of such matters. In The use of pleasure, Volume II of his History of sexuality , Michel Foucault deploys three senses of the term 'morality', suggesting a moral code, the exercise of behaviour in transgression or obedience in respect of that code (a 'morality of behaviours'), and the way in which individuals form themselves as 'ethical subjects' in relation to the elements of a code. The last gives a broader sense of 'practices of self', of what Foucault terms an 'aesthetics of existence'.13 The moral geographies of Broadland work around all three of Foucault's senses of morality, and bring out their explicit environmentality.14 We can elucidate this point through Foucault's treatment of the aesthetic. Foucault's employment of the term 'aesthetics of existence' contains a certain ambiguity. As Thacker argues Foucault veers between two senses of the aesthetic, the one entailing an aestheticization of everyday life, extending but sustaining the autonomy of the aesthetic, the other seeking to problematize the place of the aesthetic in social and political life, to break its categorical aura in a manner which transgresses the arrangement of life into discrete realms of cognition, ethics and aesthetics.15 It is in this latter sense that I draw on Foucault here. Recent work on the aesthetic within geography has tended to proceed as an adventure into an autonomous realm, hitherto untrodden by the geographer.16 Work on the self has also perhaps tended to present a voyage into an uncharted and heady interior, rather than a connection to and transformation of existing ground.17 This essay proceeds by contrast from a rearrange- ment of the terrain which, through reworking questions of people and environment, places them at the heart of issues of aesthetics, morality and selfliood. As shown above, though, such matters are not new within geography.

Stallybrass and White com- ment in the context of Foucaulťs writings on transgression on how questions posed as novel turn out to be matters which have long exercised bourgeois moralists.18 Concern for the aesthetics of existence did not subside with Foucaulťs Greeks, and I would suggest that twentieth-century geography for one has continually exercised itself over such issues. This earlier concern though was seldom a critical one. Such work seldom embodied a problematization of the moral and aesthetic, indeed proceeded from a rock- solid and supposedly self-evident aesthetic and moral base. This essay then, while acknowledging an earlier geography, does not seek to connect with it across the years, but proceeds from a very different ground, more marsh than bedrock, and more concerned to inject unsettling matters into geography than to boost the discipline to new territory. The theme of moral geography then is that of different, often conflicting, ways of being-in-the-world. This is geography in the sense of human-environment relations, and of location. This latter most obvious banal sense of geography will be seen to play a key role in Broadlanďs moral geography.19 These practices of self take place,20 happening somewhere and necessarily sustaining and remaking themselves through their environment, which they in turn reconfigure. This paper considers these issues through different cultures of self and environ- ment in Broadland. The bulk of the essay takes its stories from the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century; at the end the issues raised are brought to the contempo- rary scene. For the sake of brevity material from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s is not covered; I would argue though that the earlier trajectories traced continued through that period. This article is structured to bring out the relational development of two versions of Broadland, based around different moral geographies. The first section considers ways of being afloat, focusing on criticisms of the behavioural and architectural environment of tourism, the promotion of codes of conduct for leisure, and contrasts drawn between motor cruising and sailing. The second section considers the culture of nature in Broadland which emerged in relational contrast to the boat- hire industry. Focusing upon wildfowling, birdwatching and nature protection, the shifting complexities in the culture of nature are explored around issues of locality, class, gender and ecology. After considering the spatial layout of these different versions of Broadland, the essay concludes by tracing the resonances of these histories in contemporary moral geographies. We begin though with the recreational geog- raphy of the Norfolk Broads. Being afloat Vulgar boating The Broads were 'discovered' by outsiders in the 1880s and 1890s. Artists, writers and photographers, often in the employ of railway companies seeking to open up the area for holiday traffic, presented a distinct land within easy reach for the wealthier classes.21 An industry of boat hiring grew up, well-off parties cruising in the hands of locally hired crew, often in wherries converted from former cargo use. Ecumene 1994 1 (2)</page><page sequence="5">Moral geography in Broadland 131 From the outset those purporting to write about and on behalf of the area had reservations. The discovery of the Broads was seen to threaten destruction: Each year they had seen the crowds growing and the holiday season lengthening, until it seemed that the beautiful waterways would be turned into a Blackpool or a Brighton . . . great fleets of tripper boats sweeping up and down the narrow Bure; . . . hired yachts, floating ice-cream vendors, bum-boats and craft of every description, largely in the hands of people who had not the slightest knowledge of how to manage them.22 One finds a general grouch against the alien and the vulgar intruding into Broadland. One should be wary here though of assuming an easy local versus outsider line of conflict. The published complaints are generally those of middle- or upper- class men, from both within the district and outside, who assume a right to speak on behalf of the place. The views of the vulgar visitor are seldom voiced, likewise the views of local working people. It is not hard to imagine a welcome being given by, for example, local youth to the incident provided by vulgar boating. Saturday night in Potter Heigham could be rather different come tourism. One should also be wary of speculating on the general experience of such heterogenous categories as 'working- class youth'. Such commentary would demand the use of sources other than the published material upon which this essay largely relies. It is at least worth registering though that 'vulgar boating' might be welcome for reasons besides employment and profit, leavening everyday dullness and disturbing dominant moral geographies. What for one can be a term of approbation can for another suggest the 'wonderfully vulgar', or simply a deft and rude gesture to the moralist. Being vulgar can mean very different things, not least within the cultures of England. Vulgarity tends to be pinned on the visitor to highlight what Stallybrass and White term the grotesque as opposed to the classical body. Such bodies, transgressing the desired version of Broadland public space, dance awkwardly on the river bank and generally blare in the landscape, their antics showing their lack of self-containment. The idea of the Broads as a public space for those from beyond the region is made through defining that which does not belong.23 The Broads are envisaged as a pleasurably composed space; vulgar bodies lack composure. Different classes though decompose themselves in different manners; while the middle and upper classes show themselves up as individuals, the working classes disturb en masse. The hiring of yachts and cruisers was, until after the Second World War, a middle- or upper-class pursuit. A commentary emerges on how such classes should conduct themselves in the landscape. An index of stock vulgar characters builds up, especially in relation to matters of noise and dress. Children are rarely commented on; the objection focuses on non-family mixed groups and what they get up to. In 1933 the geographer Vaughan Cornish prepared a report for the East Central Norfolk Joint Planning Committee on Broadland scenery: 'the charm of the place is largely dependent upon the quietude which harmonises with the visual . . . scene . . . there is now no quietude in the summer holidays'. Cornish lamented 'the vulgarity of noise', the coming of 'the blare of gramophones to the once silent Broads'.24 Wealthy American bank retiree Drew Miller, converter of a mill on the Bure near Wroxham, self-styled chronicler of the area, and author of yearly 'What to do . . .' guides, suggested that local people resented 'the jazzing of the Broads', 'gramophones belching forth the fatuous efforts of some adenoidal crooners'.25 Ecumene 1994 1 (2)</page><page sequence="6">132 David Matless Disgust achieved a national audience in Arthur Ransome's 1934 environmental morality tale for children, Coot club.26 Ransome presents the adventuring children of the professional class. Visitors Dick and Dorothea Cullum, offspring of an archae- ologist, and local hero Tom, son of a Horning doctor, defend a version of Broadland centred on nature, of which more below. The recurring villain is a large and thoughtless motor cruiser carrying 'Hullabaloos', who break the peace aurally and visually: 'A very loud loudspeaker was asking all the world never to leave him, always to love him, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, bang, bang, bang'. Women appear in 4 the gaudiest of beach pyjamas'.27 Chastising references abounded at this time to female visitors crossing the boundaries of dress, wearing night clothes in the day, and male clothes at that. The Hullabaloos' vanity and ostentation is sunk in the end, with the cruiser holed by a post on Breydon Water. The 'loud treacly voice', crooning 'I want to be a ducky, a doodle-um, a duckle-um', persists until the boat goes down; a local reworking of the Titanic disaster, their titanic arrogance holed.28 Vulgarity was also detected in the outgoings of working-class 'trippers', equally presented as blind followers of fashion giving at most a vacant stare to the landscape. Nostalgia is cultivated for a Broadland of the 1880s without 'noisy launches laden with trippers'.29 Steamer cruises were popular from the 1890s, and steam and electric boats still run today. Pńde of the Yare operated from Yarmouth up the summer Waveney; Queen of the Broads explored the Bure to Wroxham and back, up to 180 people paying a few shillings for the 65-mile trip (Figure 2). The boats would sound the horn on approaching bends or villages; children would assemble on the banks and call for pennies. Miller describes a river-made music hall: ' "A Bicycle Built For Two" is heard every day during the summer from the many tripper boats'.30 Shorter cruises ran onto Breydon, other vessels tripped from Norwich and Wroxham.31 The common base for Figure 2 ~ Postcard of SS Queen of the Broads on the Bure near Wroxham c. 1912.

Contours of different pleasures emerge in Broadland in the first half of this century. The foci of fear/fun are Yarmouth, Wroxham, main base of the boat-hire industry, and Potter Heigham on the Thurne. The latter becomes a key site, especially in relation to architectural developments. The built environment is very much part of Broadland' s moral geography. Potter Heigham 's river banks were the site of the only large-scale interwar plotland development in Broadland (Figure 3). The same vocabulary is deployed for buildings as for people; loudness, impudence, indiscipline, vulgarity, 'disgusting spoliation of Broadland scenery; wooden huts and corrugated iron fences obscured views . . . delightful in their natural beauty',35 'unsightly bungaloid growth which, in the best interests of Broadland, must be removed'.36 The language continues today, the Broads Authority activating this morality in their literature on the 'Last Enchanted Land': What has gone urrong? . . . Ugly buildings with no Broads character, kiosks and amusement arcades have sprung up and poorly-designed chalets and houseboats now line some stretches of river bank. In the past, some holiday companies have marketed Broads holidays with scant regard for the unique character and fragile nature of the area, encouraging visitors to come to the Broads for the wrong reasons (original emphasis).37 Figure 3 ~ Broadland vernacular?

The definition of the Broads as fragile and in need of firm care embodies its own moral geography. Another image of Potter Heigham history can act as a coda to 'Vulgar Boating'. One of Broadland's more famous visitors was the singing and ukelele-playing variety and film star George Formby, epitome of Yarmouth style, who from 1947 spent part of every summer cruising with his wife. Formby's biographers record how in 1951, anonymous under dark glasses, he piloted yachts under Potter Heigham's awkwardly low bridge.38 Formby ill fits the iconography of the Broads Authority, who would rather not allow the sauce of the seaside into the 'Last Enchanted Land'. Two versions of enchantment collide. In 1991 Norfolk County Council sought to demolish Formby's former riverside dwelling, 'Heronby', as part of the Wroxham bypass scheme. Protesting George Formby Society members 'took along their ukeleles and sang Formby classics on the riverside behind the boarded-up luxury home'.39 Bear this curious image of heritage protest in mind when we discuss the other moral geographies of Broadland constructed around the culture of nature. We must first though briefly examine a kind of boating rarely condemned, and consider the development of environmental codes of conduct. Sailing Most leisure activities promoted by those seeking to speak for the district belong to the culture of nature, considered below. One form of boating however could figure in an improving moral geography. Sailing, in contrast to the motor cruising developed between the wars, was seen to nurture a good mind and body. Sailing appears as a directional leisure, conducted by a self alert to where it's going. The idyllic, drifting side of sailing appears only as an interlude in action. Cruising by contrast produces a lazy wandering, chugging between pubs, demanding no effort, a summer indulgence with a care neither for the world nor for the drifting self. In Coot Club good sailing children are set against cruising 'Hullabaloos'. Dick and Dorothea learn the skills from local Tom. Occasional bursts of alert sailing talk - 'May I use your peak halyards'40 - accompany a general commentary on the visitors' physical transforma- tion. Dorothea wishes others could see her and Dick's sailor's hands: 'They are so beautifully horny'.41 Similar arguments inform John Arrow's 1949 call for a Broads National Park: 'safe amateur sailing . . . combines a twenty-four-hour-a-day open air life with all the opportunities for personal initiative and self-reliance you could ask for'. Arrow notes differences of 'age, temperament and skill' in sailors and motorists, and his tone hardly counters the 'common heresy' that 'because sailing requires the exercise of qualities that most people think desirable, consequentiy that motoring about the river is undesirable'. Arrow certainly never questions the grounds of desirability, and his assertion of the 'self-reliance and individualism' of sailing over the mechanized movement of cruising extends beyond the water: 'There are no mechanized amuse- ments in Broadland whatever. No cinemas, no pin-table saloons, no "popular" restaurants. ... If you find a Broads holiday . . . boring, it will be because you find yourself dull'.42 Action on the water fits the broader ethos. Mentally and physically alert bodies occupy the desired public space. Sailing also structures the one occasion when codes on behaviour can be relaxed Ecumene 1994 1 (2)</page><page sequence="9">Moral geography in Broadland 135 without censure, the regatta. This is a carnival time of permitted jocularity, a 'water frolic', and often with an accompanying fair. Regattas are not occasions without regulation; the Norfolk and Suffolk Regatta Association was founded in 1894, in part to ensure 'uniformity of action' and 'clean sailing' at less formal village regattas.43 This is still fun within bounds, but fun here accepted by those who might otherwise frown. Dutt describes the Wroxham Regatta's Formbyesque jollity: 'Across the still water comes the tinkling of banjoes and the music of voices blended in merry choruses . . . often the sounds of revelry cease only when the light of dawn is seen in the eastern sky'.44 A music hall is sanctioned for a night or two, a hard racing day permitting an indulgent evening. Codes for Broadland The promotion of 'positive' ways of being took place within a framework of codes for conduct, established as both prohibitive and enabling. Behavioural criticisms were accompanied by a stress that leisure should be welcomed as potentially physically, morally and spiritually healthy: The more the English become an urban race the more necessary it is to ensure ... a counterbalance . . . where they can re-establish contact with nature, where they can breathe deeply (both literally and metaphorically) and where they can enjoy a life in which their own initiative has full scope in contrast to the synthetically organised life of the town.45 Such recreating leisure was to be encouraged in part through country codes. The Broads are never envisaged as a strictly regimented land,46 but limits are drawn which frame an ideal against which events can be judged, and within whose bounds selves may be nurtured. In fiction, in guidebooks, in byelaws, a Broadland code develops. G. C. Davies, in The Hvers and Broads of Norfolk and Suffolk , the leading guidebook from 1882 until the 1930s, cautioned against any noise after 11 p.m., fires on banks, litter, the picking of flowers, the undue harassment of fauna, and cricket or tennis in the meadows.47 A river police, both uniformed and plain clothed, enforced the by-laws: 'Obscene language or behaviour - loud or boisterous behaviour in any town or near houses, or moored boats will lead to arrest'.48 The Broads become a giant open-air youth hostel, with certain practices forbidden in order to make a nurturing place for an improved citizen. Just as architectural 'disfigurement' is connected to a broader culture of vulgarity, so improving ways of being are seen to have their appropriate environment. Neatness, order and grouping become the watchwords for Broadland building. A modern orderly waterside vernacular - functional staithes, grouped villages - nurtures the citizen, not in an environmentally deterministic manner but in the sense of individual and collective selves formed through their being-in-the-world. Codes emerge then in the first half of the century for building and behaviour, the two seen as necessarily complementary. In Foucault's terms a 'morality of behaviours' is established. What though were the 'practices of self' to be promoted within this frame? What might flesh out these codes into an 'aesthetics of existence' able to counter that of Broads-as- funland? We have seen the place of sailing in this scheme of things. We now turn to the Broadland culture of nature.49 Ecumene 1994 1 (2)</page><page sequence="10">136 David Matless The culture of nature This part of the essay should be read as running parallel to the material on vulgar boating. The Broadland culture of nature, shifting around questions of locality, class, gender and ecology, will be traced from the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century through the various attentions given to birds. In contrast to those having raucous fun on the water, the bodies attending to the birds are seldom grotesque. The degree to which they can be labelled 'classical' varies, but these tend to be composed bodies, conducting themselves with care. We will consider in this regard birdshooting, birdwatching and nature reserves; we begin though with children having adventures. Adventures in wildfowl: class and carnage The children's literature of adventure provides a way in to more general matters. Two books dominate the Broadland scene; Ransome's Coot club, and G. C. Davies' 1876 The Swan and her crew. In both nature is central to the morality tale offered to the reader. The forces of good in Coot club centre on the observation and protection of birds, an activity serving to sharpen mind and body. This is a very physical culture of nature. Local hero Tom is in a Bird Protection Society; Tom and Dick act as vigilante boy scouts for the local wildlife. Dorothea doesn't get involved in direct action, tending rather to be sent by Ransome into romantic fantasies on nature. The more practical boys are not allowed such dreaming. All the children though are mentally and physically sharpened by their regard for nature, in contrast to the Hullaballoos' way of being in Broadland. Ransome's themes were not new locally. Davies' The Swan and her crew , one of the first stories to popularize the district, continued to sell into the 1930s.50 Davies now occupies a central place in the local literary heritage; there are however elements of his work which tend to be skated over today. The Swan fits squarely into that nineteenth-century culture of hunting and shooting central to the British imperial ethos.51 Broadland moral geography begins with an imperial engagement with nature in Norfolk. Davies connects the watching and shooting of birds to an imperial model of environmental masculinity; as we shall see, however, other models of Broadland Man operated which departed from Davies' young adventurers. Davies tells of the transformation of delicate, bookish, friendless and sickly Dick, son of Sir Richard Carleton. Too timid to be sent to public school, Dick is placed in the care of Frank Merrivale, 'a tall, large-limbed boy . . . yellow-haired and blue- eyed',52 and his friend Jimmy Brett. The book is a tale against decadence. Dick is transformed from being an aesthete; he doesn't lose his sense of beauty, but it is supplemented by sturdyness. Sir Richard is struck on his return: 'His form was upright and full of vigour, and his handsome face was bright with the smile of health'. Such a contrast to the previous 'pale-faced delicate boy'.53 This new strength is applied in a class warfare for the Broads-as-nature-district. As in Coot club and Ransome's other Broads tale, The big six, local villainous youth, as well as outsiders, are enemies of local nature. In Yarmouth, 12 'street-boys' smash eggs in a game. Jimmy and Dick back up Frank and his 'excellent boxing position, his blue eyes gleaming with such a Berserker rage'. They march off heads high, eggs rescued, 'with a conscious feeling of superiority'.54 The boys support the local deserving poor, Ecumene 1994 1 (2)</page><page sequence="11">Moral geography in Broadland 137 donating surplus bream to 4 old Matthew Cox and his wife, who have nothing but the parish allowance to live on',55 but firmly punish the undeserving. Poachers rob their eel night-lines, and Frank insists on giving them a 'drubbing': 'His family had so befriended the poor people around, that it was very ungrateful of some of them to rob their line'.56 Dick is in part transformed by wondering at Nature: 'I did not know that life could possibly be so jolly, until I learnt something of natural history'.57 In its stress on nature and its observation The Swan ... is a classic pro to-scouting tale, with 'habits of self- reliance' and abilities to read environmental signs abounding.58 The boys' regard for nature extends though to the shooting of the birds they observe, and the collecting of their eggs. The book is subtitled 'The adventures of three young naturalists and sportsmen on the Broads and rivers of Norfolk'. This double love for nature, looking and killing, is central to the Broadland culture of nature well into the twentieth century. John MacKenzie writes of how 'killing for character formation, study, collecting and display' was a key 'moral purpose' in the nineteenth-century popularization of natural history.59 Shooting is presented with relish in The Swan ... as both an aid to study and an improving activity for a young man. The boys go 'flapper-shooting', taking aim at young ducks only just able to fly: 'great fun'.60 Dick isn't quite so keen on shooting and prefers watching a bird, but Davies hastens to assure the reader that this is not because he is unmanly: 'It must not be thought that Dick was mawkishly sentimental, but he had not the organ of destructiveness that Frank had'.61 Dick certainly doesn't object when Frank's destructiveness goes into overdrive: 'For an hour or two they had good sport beating about the dykes, and flushing them one by one until they had disposed of the whole brood'.62 The theatre of cruelty takes another twist as, on spying a huge pike eat a waterhen, they bait the fish with a wing-clipped live bird.68 The Swan ... is exceptional in applauding egg collecting; others wrote in anger against 'the iniquitous egg-maniac'.64 Moral codes shift as to what should or should not be done, concerned as much though with the moral conduct of the avaricious human as with the effect on bird populations. Indeed while codes may change, the values seen to make up 'positive' ways of being in Broadland may remain. The model user of the Broads - alert, active, self-reliant, nature-loving - is seldom challenged by those writing for the district. Bird shooting remained an activity that many naturalists embraced well into the twentieth century. Peter Scott, a regular visitor to the Broads between the wars, presents watching and shooting together, edging a punt gun through reeds to blow away whole flocks at a time. Scott's spectacular paintings of birds in flight display both wild beauty and a challenging target.65 There is a historiographical point to be made here about shooting and conservation. The story tends to be told, often by those who have themselves abandoned the gun, as a conversion to bird-love. The path to conservation becomes a road to Damascus, an enlightenment from cruelty. Watching replaces shooting as true care for birds dawns on the world. But what if we read the double shooting-watching period not as a transitional stage or deviant prelude to modern conservation but as a time and stance of its own, which produced a culture of conservation not so different from that which followed? The conservationist persona developed through shooting and watching may indeed carry over after the gun is put down.

And neither act vulgarly in the country. This is not to argue that to turn from shooting to watching is insignificant, but by placing the culture of nature within a wider moral geography we may shift our sense of what conservation has meant, giving attention to its codes of conduct, its aesthetics of existence.66 To return to Norfolk. The central figure in the early twentieth-century Broadland culture of wildfowling was Arthur Patterson (Figure 4).67 While acknowledging Davies' work, Patterson departs from the adventuring ethos of The Swan . . . Much influenced by Henry Thoreau,68 Patterson presents an intensely lived-in world, inhabiting a social ecology rather than testing nature's strength and limits. Patterson was born in 1857 and died in 1935. He grew up in the back-to-back housing of the Yarmouth Rows and lived in the town for most of his life. A Primitive Methodist preacher, local newspaper columnist under the penname John Knowlittle', school attendance officer, and naturalist, Patterson was a public figure of Broadland. Here we focus on his telling of wildfowling, which brings out key issues of locality, class and ecology. Prefacing Notes of an East Coast naturalist in 1904 Patterson wrote: Ecumene 1994 1 (2)</page><page sequence="13">Moral geography in Broadland 139 Since 1891, I have entirely discarded the gun as a 'help' to observation, and have derived comparably more real pleasure and interest in the pursuit of wild-life with a field-glass than I ever did with a fowling-piece. I only regret that so many incidents herein should relate to slaughter and sport.69 As the last remark indicates, Patterson did not censor himself, and his direct and unflinching record of death in nature makes him awkward to claim for an anti- shooting culture of nature. Patterson's is a very visceral kind of birdwatching; one of his techniques was to stake down a large and stinking lobster, a rabbit skin and half a pig's head in the middle of a mud flat to attract gulls.70 A further factor also however nuances Patterson's writings on the gun. Distinctions made according to the class and geographical origin of fowlers make it equally awkward for Patterson to be claimed, as has been attempted, for the hunting and shooting branch of conservation.71 Patterson slips through standard nets. In 1930, Patterson wrote of the decline of free-shooting: 'The Broads are now a closely protected preserve of the landed proprietors or holders of shooting rights, and are more or less bird sanctuaries in the close season'.72 If the term 'bird sanctuary' has any positive sense here it is as a fortunate side-effect of an unjust situation. The class nature of shooting comes out clearly in Wildfowlers and poachers, Patterson's elegaic 1929 record of 'Fifty years on the east coast'. The book tells of a passing way of life, of wildfowlers who shot for food and livelihood around the tidal estuary of Breydon Water. Patterson places side-by-side photographs of wildfowler John 'Little Pintail' Thomas (Figure 5), sat by his shed, and 'R. Fielding Harmer, gentleman wild-fowler', posed in a studio, dressed for fowling. Patterson describes Harmer's vanity: He rowed and shot over the Estuary with the airs and imperiousness of a Tudor lord; . . . 'rigged' for an expedition and wearing a pointed beard. ... He slavishly dressed as recommended by Colonel Hawker. The rank and file of the illiterate, unrefined horde of fishermen and fowlers were, I think, more amused than awed by his assumption and self- assertion.73 Much of Patterson's work is dedicated to recording the latter group. Questions of class and ecology lie at the heart of this culture of nature. Patterson's Breydoners are a class apart, poachers as well as wildfowlers. Patterson is writing of a time when Game Laws and their transgression remained at the heart of rural class conflict, not least in Norfolk.74 When Patterson's people extend their fowling from open unowned Breydon onto surrounding land, they poach. While the poacher often acts as an acceptable literary transgressor of the social order, Patterson's are not harmless romantic creatures: ' "Now, young Patt'son", says 'Dinks' Cox, "I never stole from a man of my own class, . . . whatever I did nab come from a richer one, and worn't missed" '75 Compare the 'drubbing' of poachers in The Swan and her crew. More could be said of Patterson's people on their culture and economy.76 Patterson's is also very much an elegy for a male world. Women appear only occasionally, and Patterson notes their drab and hard child-rearing and home-making life.77 This is a different male Broadland though from that of Davies' young men. Patterson's work brings out the different social cultures of nature in Broadland at this time, not least as it places local people, including Patterson himself, firmly within local nature. Here Patterson is crucially different from the culture of nature which develops Ecumene 1994 1 (2)</page><page sequence="14">140 David Matless Figure 5 ~ The Breydon pun t-gunner John 'Pintail' Thomas.

The photograph originally appeared in Patterson's Wild-fowlers and poachers (London, Methuen, 1929). during the 1920s and after. Patterson's Broadland Man is part of the local ecology; a key element in the subsequent Broads culture of nature is his dropping out of the scene. In Patterson's writing we find a lively and often rude social ecology,78 although this is often a work of remembrance. Wildfowlers and poachers tells of a 'disappearing class': 'Of all the many professional puntgunners I knew in my early manhood, at the moment of writing but one aged man survives'.79 Patterson offers a social ecological version of changing Broadland; in subsequent work the human drops out of the ecology. The holiday industry, for example, is never placed within nature, rather it skates on the surface of Broadland. Nature becomes defined through its detachment from the human, in part because the way of life defined as natural is seen to have passed. The Broads, if not promoted/lamented as a funland, are increasingly presented as essentially and ideally a nature reserve. Reserving nature From the 1920s nature in Broadland becomes increasingly reserved. The often rudely peopled nature of Patterson's work is overtaken by a version of Broads nature under Ecumene 1994 1 (2)</page><page sequence="15">Moral geography in Broadland 141 threat and demanding protection, located away from the human and warranting quiet observation rather than loud killing. We can approach this shift through Emma Turner's 1924 Broadland birds.80 Turner lived for long periods on a houseboat by an islet in Hickling Broad. While not the first to write on the local birds, Turner, in her difference to Patterson, brings out key facets of an emerging culture of nature. Firstly Turner is implacably anti-shooting. Writing on ducks, she concludes: Alas for the poor flappers, August and the fateful 1st will be upon them before long. Then good-bye to the undisturbed serenity of the Broad. From dawn to dusk the fusilade goes on . . . The wild-fowl are unapproachable ... a discordant note has been struck which vibrates through the bird-world and makes it out of tune.81 Shooting becomes a war between the human and the natural, shattering a possible quiet and reserved harmony. Secondly, Turner writes on an estate. She and Patterson write for Broadland from decidedly different bases. Turner is on the White Slea estate at Hickling, there by the owner's grace. Unlike Patterson's most common subject, the open and unowned Breydon Water, this is a potentially manageable Broadland. The local people - Turner's main characters are keeper Jim Vincent and the helpful Nudd brothers - are still presented as close to nature, locally wise and 'a race apart',82 but while distinct they do not lead an independent or especially rude existence. The locals are tamer in this reserved nature, not least because they are under employ. Turner tells of Cubit Nudd's diligent tending of her boats, and remembers, on first arriving at Hickling, asking a man where Alfred Nudd might be: 4 "I am Alfred Nudd. Yon goes a Hen Harrier". And that was my first introduction to Nudd, and to the Broadland birds' (Figure 6).83 Turner, unlike Patterson an outsider to Norfolk, enters estate Broadland between the owner and the workers, with the co-operation of both, to record the birds. Hickling is the site of a key story in the Broadland culture of nature, of the restoration of the bittern.84 Absent for decades, the bird reappeared in 1911, and was restored to breeding at Hickling by Vincent. This narrative, told by both Turner and Vincent in anthropomorphic bird-family language,85 crucially takes place within a managed area. The estate can act as nature reserve; the reserve idea is made in Broadland on the estate model. Here nature can persist, and humans can recreate themselves through its observation. The bittern, in particular its eerie burpy booming call ('the occult, resonant gong of this baroque fowl')86 becomes symbolic of Broadland's health as a nature-district. Turner presents the bird as one with its environment. Ridiculous in gait on dry land but nimble in the marsh, the bittern is shown 'turning itself into the semblance of a reed' (Figure 7). It is too simple however to line up the newly reserved nature against shooting. While Turner lamented the sound of shot, Vincent, as keeper for successive owners of White Slea, arranged coot shoots for visiting guns, including the King and Peter Scott. Country Life , publishers of Turner, printed not only Vincent's 'Romance of the bittern' but his story of a 'Coot drive on Lord Desborough's shoot'. Shots of advancing gun punts illustrate stories of great bags: 1213 coots in one day is the record. Vincent has distributed 24,000 free dead coots to local people in 23 years: 'after a shoot th~ scent of coots cooking can be detected here and there as one passes through the village'.87 Ecumene 1994 1 (2)</page><page sequence="16">142 David Matless Figure 6 ~ 'Alfred Nudd awaits his turn of the stereoscope': Emma Turner and Alfred Nudd. (From Emma Turner, Broadland birds , 1924, facing p. viii. Reproduced by kind permission of London, Country Life.) Vincent's keeper duties include both the preservation of rare species from poachers and collectors, and guiding authorized guests towards the common prey. To reserve nature is but one element in the estate management of wildfowl. When Vincent died in 1944 both Country Life and The Field, journals of the English rural order, paid fulsome tribute to a man simultaneously naturalist, keeper, fisherman and wild- fowler.88 Vincent's shepherding of nature was no bloodless care. The emergence of an idea of reserved nature is far then from a tale of care versus killing. Some protectors opposed shooting, others worked for it. The story is less one of enlightenment from shooting than of different senses of care for and management of land. In the internar period, shooters, watchers and shooter-watchers occupied common managerial ground. There is a distinction between proponents of privately and publically reserved nature, although the latter ethos, developing in the internar period, invariably works on the managerial model of the private estate. The argument is made that care for nature cannot be trusted to private owners in the long term, whatever their good intentions. Nature, permanent yet delicate, demands another kind of care. This model of care grows in particular through the Norfolk Naturalists' Trust, founded in 1926 to hold land against agricultural or leisure development. The Trust, the first in the country, soon moved into Broadland, working through land purchase or co-operation with sympathetic owners. The White Slea estate was acquired in 1945. 89 The Trust did not seek public ownership but offered an enlightened care for nature on behalf of the public. The politics of nature at this time is shot through with assumptions concerning the ability of elected managerial bodies or the visiting Ecumene 1994 I (2) ALFRED NUDD AWAITS HIS TURN OF THE STEREOSCOPE.</page><page sequence="17">Moral geography in Broadland 143 Figure 7 ~ 'Camouflage: turning itself into the semblance of a reed : a Hickling bittern, photographed by Emma Turner. (From Emma Turner, Broadland birds , 1924, facing p. 4. Reproduced by kind permission of London, Country Life.) public to act in the interests of nature. A public ethos of nature-care emerges which is loath to trust the public as presently constituted.90 The changes in the culture of nature after 1945 are beyond this article, but again the work of an individual, the naturalist Ted Ellis, allows us a brief excursion. A pupil and friend of Patterson, and much involved with the Norfolk Naturalists' Trust, Ellis worked in Norwich Castle Museum's natural history department from 1928 to 1956.91 Ellis symbolizes Broadland nature moving into public culture, although still on the model of the reserved estate. A Fellow of the Linnean Society, Ellis and his wife lived in the marsh near Surlingham on the Yare; in his writing and local broadcasting Broadland and nature became synonymous.92 R. H. Mottram introduces an Ellis 'Naturalist's Diary' thus: This which follows is what goes on, so persistently and quietly, while statesmen argue, the city crowd herds in its non-natural avocation and time and change are recorded by artificial means, as if human volition made history. But the wild life of the Broads existed before there was any recognisable England and will surely remain when most of the appearances of the twentieth century have vanished.93 Ecumene 1994 1 (2)</page><page sequence="18">144 David Matless Nature persists, away from and uninhabited by the human, to be protected for itself, and for the knowing or unknowing public alike. A culture of reserved nature emerges then in the first half of this century, alongside the vulgar funland of the boat-hire industry, and in a departure from Patterson's social ecology. 'Reserve' is an apt term for both the nature managed and the ethos of its preservation. Writing on nature conservation generally misses the model of the conserver implicit or explicit in the practice. The culture of nature, as much as the vulgar boating considered earlier, is a matter of moral geography, of how people might or might not form themselves environmentally. To end this section it is worth sketching some of the different figures in this landscape, less to sum up the preceding account than to indicate the kind of themes which might be drawn out of any such story, although the detail here may be particular to the Broads. The boys and wildlife in The Swan and her crew are on the range. Davies' boys have an imperious presence in an active nature. Ransome's children too range around Broadland, but their wildlife is no longer so wild, indeed demands a protective human wing for shelter from Hullabaloos. A domestication of parts of nature is under way, with the role of the good human being to reserve and harbour nature where possible, while roaming protectively over the remaining land and water. On her island, Emma Turner cares for the birds, places them under her nursing camera, picturing happy bird families. Is this a domestication of nature and a feminizing of the human? We should be wary of too simple a reading. The general shift is perhaps from an aggressive and youthful masculinity to a set of masculine values associated with age, to a shepherding rather than a monitoring of nature. Coot club indeed features youth already wary of being irresponsible in the service of nature. Ransome's children enjoy their youth through learning to be older. Davies' boys will grow up trying to retain their boyish energy. The model of those who spend their leisure in the watchful pursuit of nature shifts. What then of those who work in the service of nature? Local working figures in the landscape provide exemplars of the human in nature. As Patterson's coarse and ranging wildfowlers pass into the past, local nature wisdom is gathered up around less rude keepers of nature. Jim Vincent exercises the paternal care of the shepherd, reserving the rare and keeping the common for the gunner. As the care for nature moves into public culture, a model of wardenship emerges, half-keeper half-watcher, with wisdom derived from a dialogue of books and long observation.94 Care for habitat may still demand some judicious culling, but death for sport becomes an indulgence, and takes less place. Wardens watch over a delicate nature perhaps increasingly feminized under paternal care, no longer an active adversary for the sporting man but a place for careful reserve, for gentle enthusiasms. This account of course oversimplifies, and should not be taken as a sealed argument, but it serves to indicate some general contours of the story. The changing culture of nature embodies shifting models of the natural and the human. Fauna, human and animal, alter through moral geography. The first half of the century shows an increased focusing of Broadland nature. The ethos of reserve has however shifted in recent years. A less reserved culture of nature has emerged, to which we turn below. First, some attention is due to the layout of the practices considered so far. Ecumene 1994 1 (2)</page><page sequence="19">Moral geography in Broadland 145 Layout This article has followed certain practices to certain locations; some parts of Broadland have scarcely been mentioned. We have alighted chiefly on parts of the Bure and Thurne. Save for Breydon, the southern rivers have barely featured. The contours of the holiday industry and the culture of nature have shaped the discussion. These main versions of Broadland, funland and nature-district, are marked out not only by their values but by their inhabiting different parts of the district. Moral geography operates also through layout. This most banal sense of geography has a key formative power in the conflicts between different versions of place. The general if simplified picture is of the upper Bure, lower Ant and lower Thurne as the heart of funland, with the lower Bure, Yare and Waveney as the site of a bleaker and less-frequented wildness. The Yare is also a more industrial waterway, with sea- going trading vessels, peaking in numbers in the 1930s, going up to Norwich, its skyline dominated for miles by the Gantley sugar-beet processing factory, opened in 1912 (Figure 8).95 By contrast the upper Thurne appears as an almost mystical waterland, a heart of enchantment adjacent to the shacks of Potter Heigham. The Broads Authority have recently taken to describing Broadland as a whole as the 'Last enchanted land', but this is very much an extension of a theme which has in the past been focused on (or hemmed into) certain places. For a more detailed sense of the Figure 8 ~ Sugar-beet processing factory, Cantley, photograph by the author, May 1993. Ecumene 1994 1 (2)</page><page sequence="20">146 David Matless working of layout, and for a sense of how imagination works through the matter of the place, it is worth examining the contours of this enchantment as they emerged on the northern river system; again social and aesthetic questions mingle in moral geography. In The Norfolk Broads William Dutt described the low Medieval bridge at Potter Heigham, through which Formby would later ply his trade: To a district where survives such untarnished loveliness and primevalness, there could hardly be a more fitting portar.96 Beyond the bridge a bypass road now spans the river where an earlier railway crossed, and bungalows line the banks for a while. On turning into Heigham Sounds the banks empty of building. The distinction of the area is commonly stressed. Dutt writes of summer in Broadland: there are hundreds of cruisers who . . . believe, when they have seen the main rivers . . . and the larger Broads, that they have exhausted its delights. A few know better, and it is they who, when the main waterways are thronged with pleasure-seekers, retire on to the . . . upper waters . . . , and enjoy delights to which the majority . . . are strangers.97 The Thurne provides the most rarefied air for the cognoscenti. Dutt suggests that 'no one who knows the district intimately' would dispute that 'the most . . . popular reaches of the Bure' lack the upper Thurne's 'primeval, isolate beauty': 'Compared with Heigham Sounds at dawn or sunset, and Horsey Mere . . . Wroxham and Ranworth seem to me simply pretty'.98 Dutťs aesthetic judgements mingle with a social and intellectual exclusiveness. Describing the beauty of the coastal sandhills from Horsey Mere Dutt quotes Hardy's The return of the native on how for 'thinking humanity' definitions of beauty will increasingly come to rest on such scenes.99 Dutt sails on Heigham Sounds, a mile as the crow flies from Potter Heigham: secrets of the early world would seem to be whispered ... it is easy for the solitary cruiser to become a primitive child of Nature . . . and, in so mingling his identity with hers, to drink in delight from the fountain-head of pleasure. After a few hours spent amid such scenes he may become conscious of ... an ability hitherto, even if possessed, un-exercised, to distinguish the essential from the superfluous.100 Remaking his identity through engagement with a feminized nature, Dutt taps deep wells, though not without contradiction. Dutt suggests such tapping as a latent ability in 'nearly every man'; yet the idea of it becoming a widespread popular pursuit would destroy the required conditions of solitude.101 Dutt would seem to rest content that most people stick with 'simply pretty' Wroxham and Ranworth. Those few who venture beyond can, because they are few, possess a very different sense of place. The mystical Broadland theme is raised by a number of writers.102 The upper Thurne acts as the key site in part because it seems more of a waterland than the rest of the district. The imagination works through the landscape's matter. Broad and bank merge in an intermediate reed-land; the place lacks precise edges. Wilkie Collins, in his 1866 novel Armadale , alighted on the indeterminacy: 'The shore in these wild regions was not like the shore elsewhere . . . it . . . was floating ground, that rose and fell and oozed into puddles under the pressure of the feet'.103 This shifting land, presented also as the site of curious and transient atmospheric effects, is lent a long- term instability by the proximate sea. The coast is a mile and a half from Horsey Mere; major breaches occurred here in 1897, 1938 and 1953. Dutt, writing in 1903, worried Ecumene 1994 I (2)</page><page sequence="21">Moral geography in Broadland 147 over a lack of longshore drift from the north: 'successes in the past were chiefly due to the assistance of natural forces . . . failures in the future - for everything seems to point to failure - will be through lack of that assistance'.104 Nature is at the mercy of nature. The top of the Thurne, a vulnerable heart of enchantment, is a waterland in danger of being washed out. New moral geographies Recent years have seen an attempt to extend the notion of the Broads as an enchanted nature-district to the whole area. The culture of nature is no longer so reserved. To conclude this article it is worth intruding on the contemporary scene, attending in particular to the resonances of the material considered above.105 Versions of history are consciously drawn upon by powerful actors in the landscape, and thus to make histories resound in the district may effectively disturb the present ground, sounding out some current events. The Broads Authority, set up in 1978 as a joint committee of local authorities, and a statutory body with navigation powers since the Broads received National Park status in April 1989, 106 has been central to a refiguring of Broadland. The Authority's Chief Executive, M. Aitken Clark, tells a story of the rescue of the Broads by conservation interests which I would argue can only be understood in relation to the earlier moral geographies described here. Its gains power as a fable from activating their iconography: If on a dank and misty afternoon in autumn in the late 1970s, you had driven from Norwich along the 'Acle Straight', the road used by thousands of holidaymakers heading through the Broads towards Great Yarmouth, you might have seen little romance in the mist, and nothing but desolation in the flatness and in the derelict windpumps. If you had travelled to Wroxham and taken a diesel-powered launch along the River Bure, you might have wondered where you were supposed to find peace and tranquility. Indeed, in the sixties and seventies, the candyfloss and seaside atmosphere of chip shops, amusement arcades and souvenir shops selling trinkets and kiss-me-quick hats seemed suddenly to outweigh the quiet reedy reaches, where bitterns boomed unseen and the sails of a lone yacht drifted across the horizon. You could have been forgiven for believing the scare stories and blaming the heavy hand of commercialism that had taken its toll, exploited and spoilt for ever this fragile enchanting land. Once perhaps it may have made the grade as a national park - but alas, no longer. Perhaps it was too late for the Broads (Figure 9). 107 The Broads Authority display their environmental ethos most prominently at Cockshoot Broad and How Hill. Cockshoot lies between Horning and Ranworth, with no access for boats from the Bure. Lifeless in 1980 due to phosphates from agricultural runoff and sewage outfall, the Broad became the site for a cleansing experiment of damming and mud-pumping. Plants now thrive in the clear water, and the public may walk around the entrance dyke. The Broad can be viewed from a hide; given the tale of almost magical restoration you half expect to come upon a fabulous display of cavorting bird life. The antics of perhaps a solitary grebe may disappoint. As the Authority points out such a programme can only take place on private Broads with no navigation rights. The restoration of Cockshoot suggests a re- enchantment doomed to be limited.

Clockwise from top left: 'The Norfolk Broads, The River Bure, Acle', 'Womack Staithe, Norfolk Broads', 'Speedboat Racing, Oulton Broad', and 'The Bridge, Ludham, Norfolk'. and the cloudy liquid beyond the dyke barrier highlights the 'fallen' nature of the bulk of Broadland, fostering the narrative, not entirely consonant with the events of the past, of an earlier Eden violated by outside influence: 'Come and see what a broad should be like!'.108 Developments at How Hill on the lower Ant have a less-confined implication. Here a new unreserved culture of nature is central to an environmentally educational notion of fun in Broadland. How Hill harbours neither Hullabaloos nor trippers. A brief consideration of the site's history is telling.109 A large thatched house appeared on the hill early this century, built for and designed by leading Norwich architect and Liberal nonconformist Edward Boardman. The Boardmans entertained leading Broadland figures between the wars; Patterson and Scott were regular visitors. In 1966 the house was sold to Norfolk County Council, and in 1968 Ted Ellis opened it as an educational centre. The estate was sold to the Broads Authority in 1982; the How Hill Trust took over the house in 1984. The Authority have restored a nineteenth-century eel-catcher's dwelling into 'Toad Hole Cottage', complete with hanging pheasants and the unavoidable sense of dampness hard by the Ant, and run a Wildlife Water Trail in an Edwardian-style electric boat. All are presented as part of 'Fun in the Broads': 'Fun for all the family!'. Versions of history are gathered up into a new culture of nature. How Hill is presented in Broads Authority literature as the example of what to do Ecumene 1994 1 (2)</page><page sequence="23">Moral geography in Broadland 149 with the Broads. Its very position could indeed be read as symbolic. The house overlooks the lower Ant, just up from the older funland of the upper Bure. It is as if an unreserved culture of nature might move out from here through the district. And topography cements this impression. How Hill is one of the few sites where a river or Broad can actually be overlooked; in most of the district flatness prohibits the literal and metaphorical power of an overview. Elsewhere there is no high ground which can be taken; at How Hill topography serves to emphasize a new moral geography. A view of How Hill from the Ant takes the cover of the latest Ordnance Survey (OS) map of 'Norwich and the Broads' (Figure 10, top), confirming, one might think, the triumph of the Broads Authority culture of nature.

And if you leafed through the 1970 glossy guidebook Broadland in colour you would find this same image.110 The cover of that book shows the same scene a few moments earlier (Figure 10, bottom), the cruiser overtaking the yacht too close for comfort, the river churned and clogged.

Pile argues for psychoanalysis as an approach connecting the self and the social, but the enquiry would seem to remain metaphorically and primarily internal. The new unconscious material for geography ultimately lies inside, to be excavated. For an approach seeking to extend geographical debate on the self beyond psychoanalysis see M. Ogborn, 'Can you figure it out? Norbert Elias's theory of the self', in C. Philo (comp.), New words , new worlds , pp. 78-87. See also the environmental archetypal psychology informing P. Bishop, The myth of Shangri-La (London, Athlone, 1989). i® P. Stallybrass and A. White, The politics and poetics of transgression (London, Methuen, 1986), p. 200.

An early discussion from within the field of this essay comes in Stamp's Nature conservation in Britain (London, Collins, 1969). Nature conservation for Stamp and others is one element in a wider discourse of planning. On more recent matters of nature see S. Whatmore and S.

Worster, Nature's economy (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1977). 66 Many of course still practice a 'conservation' combining shooting and watching. The progressive story should also be interpreted as part of a contemporary debate over what conservation means. 67 S. A. Manning, The Broadland naturalist : the life of Arthur H . Patterson , A.L.S.

Mottram writes before the theory of the Broads as flooded Medieval peat-diggings was accepted in 1960. This revision of history may have helped in imagining the Broads as a humanly-manageable and malleable landscape, undercutting the fatalism of earlier scenarios of future silting up or reflooding by the sea. See, for example, the proposals to dig new broads in Nature Conservancy, Report on Broadland (London, Nature Conservancy, 1965). 94 Sheail, Nature in trust, p. 42, notes the formation of the Association of Bird Watchers and Wardens in 1936.
