<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Jordan GLEN L. PETERMAN This 1994 installment of AJA's annual newsletter on "Archaeology in Jordan" is the most compre- hensive summary to date of ongoing projects in Jor- dan (fig. 1), incorporating the work of American, Canadian, Australian, German, Swiss, and Polish as well as Jordanian excavators and researchers. Pub- lication of the newsletter in AJA was once again made possible in part by the generous support of the Jordan Society. As in previous years, the newsletter consists of brief abstracts of recent and current excavations in addition to summaries of new synthetic work pre- sented by the project directors themselves. The ma- terial is arranged in chronological order after the reports on general work and regional surveys. A debt of gratitude is owed to the members of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan and the Direc- tor-General, Safwan Tell. With their assistance these projects concerned with uncovering and under- standing the cultural heritage of Jordan have met with great success. A note of thanks is also extended to former ACOR Director Bert de Vries, who began this newsletter in the 1991 volume of AJA. Institutions frequently cited in the text are abbre- viated as follows: American Center of Oriental Re- search (ACOR); British Institute at Amman for Archaeology and History (BIAAH); Cultural Re- source Management Program ofACOR (CRM); De- partment of Antiquities of Jordan (DAJ); Institut frangais d'archdologie au Proche-Orient (IFAPO); United States Agency for International Develop- ment (USAID); and United States Information Agency (USIA). GENERAL Low-Altitude Aerial Photography. J.W. Myers and E. Myers, American School of Classical Studies at Athens, report: Balloon photography is only beginning to be used in Jordan. It is expected that this method of remote sensing will add significant data to information gathered on the ground and collected by airplanes and satellites. Two seasons of aerial photography have been car- ried out in Jordan. The first, in 1992, was a joint effort between ourselves and the Humeima, Petra, Madaba Plains, and Umm el-Jimal projects. The second, in 1993, was at the request of Nasri Atalla, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Tourism, to provide low-altitude aerial photographs of archae- ological sites. These photographs provide an accu- rate visual record of the present state of sites, which helps government officials plan strategies for pro- moting tourism through stabilization or partial res- toration of monuments, and to provide proper access and facilities for visitors. The high-resolution images also furnish scholars with a detailed record for study and publications. Because a surveyor's tri- angulation grid can be located on the photographs, it is possible to produce maps of features, such as exposed wall lines, prior to excavation. ACOR op- erated as the command center as we moved around the country with the balloon, cameras, and bottles of hydrogen and helium. In 1993, we were able to photograph the sites of Makkawir (fig. 2), Mount Nebo, Umm er-Rasas, the town of Madaba, the Citadel in Amman (including the Great Temple; see below), and Petra. At Petra we conducted low-altitude photography of the Roman street and shops, the South Temple, the Temple of Winged Lions, the Petra Church (see below), the Roman Theater, the High Place, Qasr el-Bint, and at Aklat, the Neolithic settlement at Beidha. We plan to produce, at a later date, an Aerial Atlas of Ancient Jordan, a companion volume to our Aerial Atlas of Ancient Crete (Berkeley 1992). 1992-1993 CRM Program. Gaetano Palumbo, ACOR, reports: The CRM Program is a cooperative project of ACOR and DAJ initiated in 1987. It has resulted in a series of training activities and projects aimed at the protection of the Jordanian cultural heritage and the management of archaeological and historic sites in the face of urban and rural development, site looting, tourism, and the natural decay of monu- ments. In the past year, the CRM Program has concen- trated on developing guidelines to coordinate the DAJ and public development agencies. These guidelines include 1) recommendations on steps to be taken before project design and feasibility stud- ies; 2) the introduction of Cultural Resource Impact Assessments, prepared by DAJ personnel and sub- mitted to the development agencies for considera- tion; and 3) clearly defined procedures for archae- ological rescue work. The Jordanian Ministry of Municipalities and Rural Affairs is actively partici- pating in the preparation of these guidelines. 521 American Journal of Archaeology 98 (1994) 521-59</page><page sequence="2">522 GLEN L.

(E. Alliata and PM. Bikai) The CRM Program is also developing a computer data base to assist in tackling problems of site man- agement and preservation. The data base, called JADIS (Jordan Antiquities Database and Informa- tion System), is one of the first computerized na- tional inventories of cultural resources in the Arab world. Sites are recorded with their map coordi- nates, elevation, dimensions, periods and type of occupation, and current condition (and imminent threats). Bibliography is recorded according to the system adopted by Denyse Homes-Fredericq and Basil Hennessy for their Bibliography ofJordan. Later, their data base will be integrated into JADIS. The CRM Program has also been active in in- creasing public awareness, organizing lectures at the University of Jordan and Yarmouk University,</page><page sequence="3">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 523 Fig. 2. Makkawir. Low-level aerial view. and organizing a public conference on the protec- tion of cultural heritage, held in Amman in Septem- ber 1992. Remote Sensing. David Kennedy, University of Western Australia, reports: A three-year project (1992-1994) has been un- dertaken to investigate and evaluate remote-sensing techniques used in the Middle East. At the core of the project is the systematic analysis of some 4,000 vertical aerial photographs ofJordan taken in 1953. The first period of associated fieldwork was car- ried out in 1993 by David Kennedy and James Raab-Rust. The diapositives of Jordan are at a scale of 1:25,000, but are generally very sharp in quality and can be examined directly on a light-table. Work in the field was carried out with prints of 1:10,000, found to be the maximum feasible enlargement. The photographs had not been taken with archae- ology in mind, and low oblique views would have been far superior. A number of small sites that could still be traced on the ground were quite undetect- able on the photographs either because of their size or because the view was taken in the middle of the day when there was insufficient shadow. On the other hand, many ancient features that would easily be overlooked on the ground, or have now been damaged or removed, were identified. Further- more, several large sites, some not recorded at all on the 1:50,000 maps (which were prepared from aeri- al coverage), were located on the photographs and could be understood and interpreted to a fuller ex- tent than if looked at only on the ground. The sys- tematic analysis of all of these frames will certainly permit the identification and location of many sites, most otherwise unrecorded. For the area of north- ern Jordan for which the first 180 frames have been examined to date, some 1,600 sites have been re- corded. SURVEYS Landslides in Wadi Ziqlab. John Field, Univer- sity of Arizona, reports: Record levels of precipitation in Wadi Ziqlab dur- ing the winter of 1991-1992 triggered over 250 landslides and provided a unique opportunity to study the impact of landslides on archaeological site preservation and distribution. At least four pro- cesses of interest to archaeologists are affected by landslides: 1) Site erosion. Archaeological sites at the edge of steep slopes could be affected by future landslides. One large slump during 1992 completely blocked the main channel of Wadi Ziqlab, and relocation of the channel to another portion of the wadi bottom could damage nearby archaeological sites in the fu- ture. 2) Artifact transport. Several hundred pottery sherds from a Roman site were moved by a large</page><page sequence="4">524 GLEN L. PETERMAN [AJA 98 earth slip down to the wadi bottom and 5 m up the opposite slope. Artifacts found at the base of a steep slope, therefore, may not necessarily have derived from a site higher up the same slope. 3) Site burial. The thicknesses of landslide depos- its on colluvial slopes at the base of Wadi Ziqlab are highly variable. At one site, Chalcolithic artifacts were found above Early Bronze Age (EBA) material in the colluvial deposit. This stratigraphic inversion could have occurred if landslides burying the EBA site contained Chalcolithic artifacts. 4) Site location. Repeated landslide events are primarily responsible for the formation of the collu- vial slopes along the wadi bottom and the flat benches high on the wadi slopes. Both landforms are utilized today for habitation and agriculture and the numerous archaeological sites buried in the col- luvial deposits suggest that they were also exploited at earlier times. Future surveys and excavations throughout northern Jordan and other landslide-prone regions of the world should consider the role landslides play in shaping and modifying the landscape and how this might influence the preservation and distribu- tion of archaeological sites. Southeast Wadi Araba Survey. Andrew M. Smith II, ACOR USIA Fellow, North Carolina State Uni- versity, reports: The Southeast Araba Archaeological Reconnais- sance Survey (SAARS) was designed as a feasibility study to prepare for a forthcoming, intensive survey of the region. The specific goals were 1) to visit known sites in the region; 2) to conduct limited transects to determine subregions within the study area where evidence of past human activity is appar- ent; and 3) to seek out potential bases of logistical support for the forthcoming survey. The collection of artifactual material exceeded the scope of the fea- sibility study. Seventeen previously unrecorded sites were dis- covered during the survey. Although most of these are human burial sites, prehistoric villages and asso- ciated cultic sites were also found within the Wadi Rakiya, and an ancient road with at least one asso- ciated structure in the Araba. In the expansive sand dune field north of Rahma, the remains of the paved surface/road were traced for approximately 1 km north from the mouth of the Wadi Nukhayla to the drainage leading to 'Ain Nuweiba, a recently developed spring. The presence of this stone-paved road seems to contradict some historical interpreta- tions of the nature of traffic in the Araba, viz., that the Wadi Araba was little more than an inconvenient obstacle for numerous east-west crossings. Clearly, this road represents a distinct north-south route in the valley. The first season of an intensive, systematic survey of the southeast Wadi Araba is planned for the sum- mer of 1994. Initially, the focus will be on the road and the discovery of associated structures. The pur- pose will be to gather sufficient information neces- sary to assign a relative date of use and construction of the road. Moab Marginal Agriculture Project. Bruce Rout- ledge, University of Toronto, reports: The Moab Marginal Agriculture Project was initi- ated to study the nature of human settlement dur- ing the Iron Age in the semiarid lands along the eastern fringe of the Karak plateau. Research fo- cused in particular upon an area of some 15 km2, bounded by the Karak-Qatrana highway, the Wadi es-Siyar, the Wadi er-Ramla, and Khirbet 'Arbid. This area was chosen for its position at the eastern limits of dry-farming, and for the number of prob- able Iron Age sites identified here in the work of the Limes Arabicus Project and the Central Moab Sur- vey. Our fieldwork consisted of two distinct activities: the mapping and test excavation of three sites (Khirbet 'Arbid, Khirbet Thamayil, and our site 8) thought to have late Iron Age II occupation, and the collection of sherds from the "nomadic campsites" where the Limes Arabicus Survey registered possi- ble Iron Age sherds in their field readings. Preliminary analysis of the material points to some interesting conclusions. First, all of the Iron Age material dates to the same narrow time range (late seventh-early sixth century B.C.). Hence the three towers we examined (and the Limes Survey site 51) were presumably all founded and aban- doned within a relatively short period of time. Pub- lished pottery from previous surveys indicates that most of the other Iron Age "tower" sites (some 32 sites) found along the eastern fringe, between the Wadi el-Mujib and the Wadi el-Hasa, may also be datable to this time span. Therefore it seems that, in the seventh century B.C., there was a dramatic and short-lived expansion of settlement into the region. This expansion is best seen as a case of agricultural intensification, perhaps stimulated by a growth in the apparatus of the state under Assyrian hege- mony. Our survey of "nomadic" campsites did not confirm the Iron Age II readings of the Limes Arabicus Survey. We did find a number of camp- sites, however, that showed evidence of a long con-</page><page sequence="5">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 525 Fig. 3. Madaba Plains Project.

The greatest number of sherds collected were unpainted Late Islamic handmade wares, fol- lowed in prevalence by Late Roman through Umayyad wares. Madaba Plains Project. D. Clark, Walla Walla College, L. Geraty, Atlantic Union College, L. Herr, Canadian Union College, 0. LaBianca, Andrews University, and R. Younker, Andrews University, re- port: As in previous seasons, several different survey operations were conducted in a 5-km radius around Tell el-'Umeiri as part of the Madaba Plains Project. Most significant was the ethnoarchaeological re- search conducted among the villagers regarding water use and seasonal occupation in caves, result- ing in the sensational discovery of a monumental collection of Safaitic/Thamudic (and, to a lesser ex- tent, Nabataean) inscriptions in a cistern situated near Khirbet Rufeisah, 3 km southeast of 'Umeiri. This collection of over 1,000 large letters was chis- eled over a long period of time into the cement lining of an ancient cistern within a black-painted panel encircling the cistern (fig. 3). The inscriptions seem to contain names and symbols of tribes and date to the period between ca. 500 B.C. and A.D. 500. This is one of the largest collections of such inscriptions known and it is located much farther west than what one might expect. The cave complex in which the inscriptions were found may have served as a tribal meeting place. A third survey team excavated selected small ag- ricultural features, while a fourth team began the excavation of an EB IV cemetery some 2 km south of 'Umeiri. A fifth team used ground-penetrating radar to search for underground features at 'Umeiri and the EB IV cemetery. Madaba Region, Early Bronze Age Survey. Timo- thy Harrison, ACOR USIA Fellow, University of Chicago, reports: As part of an ongoing study of the EBA in the Madaba region, a two-part survey was conducted in September 1992 and April 1993. The survey uni- verse was defined by the Dead Sea escarpment to the west, the foothills of Amman to the north, the desert steppes to the east, and the north branches of the Wadi Mujib to the south. An area of approxi- mately 1,600 km2 (40 x 40 km) was surveyed, and a total of 124 sites recorded. The survey recorded a general description of each site, collected surface sherds, and made a determination of site size and location. In addition to evidence of EBA activity, the ceramic record included material from the Middle Bronze (MB) II, Iron I, Iron II, Nabataean, Early Roman, Late Roman, Byzantine, Early Islamic, Ayyubid/Mamluk, and Late Islamic/Ottoman peri- ods. A survey of the archaeological and architectural remains of the urban core of ancient Madaba was also carried out. The purpose of this second survey was to document the existing premodern architec- tural and archaeological remains of the town and to</page><page sequence="6">526 GLEN L. PETERMAN [AJA 98 gain some sense of the occupational history of an- cient Madaba. A total area of 415,000 m2 was inten- sively and systematically surveyed. More than 130 partially or completely intact premodern buildings were identified in addition to numerous segments of walls, cisterns, caves, and fragments of columns, capitals, carved lintels, and other reused worked stone. This information was noted on a topographic map (1:250 scale) and has been added to a com- puter-digitized map being prepared for the city of Madaba. Pottery from the city of Madaba dates to the EBA, Iron II, Persian/Hellenistic, Nabataean, Early Roman, Late Roman, Byzantine, Umayyad, Abbasid, Fatimid, Ayyubid/Mamluk, Ottoman, and modern periods. A preliminary analysis of the sherd distributions from these periods indicates that the town was confined to the area of the tell during the Bronze and Iron Ages, and then began to expand to the north during the Nabataean and Early Ro- man periods, reaching its greatest extent during the Late Roman and Byzantine periods. At some point during the Early Islamic period, probably during the ninth century, the town appears to have shrunk dramatically in size-and may have even been aban- doned for a while-with what remained of the town concentrated along the old Roman cardo. There was little apparent change over the ensuing centuries. Surveys in the Southern Hauran. Alison Betts, University of Sydney, reports: In 1992 and 1993, two seasons of survey were conducted in the Southern Hauran, on and around the lower slopes ofJebel Druze. Wadi al-'Ajib Survey, 1992. A number of substantial MBA and Roman sites were recorded in the upper Wadi al-'Ajib, near the Syrian border. These sites are located on good agricultural land and probably pro- duced grain and animal products for the Bronze Age and Roman towns of the Syrian Hauran to the north. Further south are a number of smaller MBA walled farmsteads, with field systems sustained by simple canal irrigation. Where the wadi narrows south of the Baghdad highway, there is a series of Roman/Byzantine farmsteads, probably dependent largely on herding as there is little land suitable for agriculture. In the lower end of the survey area, near Khalidiya, the wadi cuts through a series of hills where there are several Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic sites. Late Natufian hunting stations occur all down the wadi in places where standing water would be available in winter. Qa'a Shubeiqa Survey, 1993. The objectives of the survey were to make a general study of prehistoric sites around the Shubeiqa mudflats, and to study the "kites" in the area. Work was carried out in col- laboration with Vadim Jagodin of the Karakalpak Academy of Sciences, Uzbekistan. The survey lo- cated three new Epipalaeolithic sites and one LN camp. Several groups of "kites" were identified in the region. On the basis of form and the state of preservation, these appear to date to a variety of periods. A number of Safaitic carvings were found in the course of survey. In addition to these, five Early Islamic inscriptions and one Greek text were recorded. Wadi al-'Ajib Survey, 1993. In the first few days of the season, several Bronze Age sites located in 1992 were revisited. The last two weeks were devoted to intensive work at the major Bronze Age site of Rukeis, a large walled citadel with traces of a lower town on the southwestern side. Canals and ancient field systems in the wadi may relate to occupation at the site. A preliminary survey of the visible remains revealed fortifications, traces of a possible gateway on the southeast side of the citadel, rectilinear walls on the summit of the citadel, some wall lines in the lower settlement, and a later building and cisterns. A trial trench was opened on top of the citadel across a circular stone-walled structure, probably a silo. Excavation uncovered vertical walls down to a depth of 2 m. Southern Hauran Survey. David Kennedy, Uni- versity of Western Australia, and Philip Freeman, Glasgow University, report: In September 1992, a second season of the South- ern Hauran Survey concentrated on three areas of activity, the first being the village of Umm el- Quttein, long known to have been a small town of the Roman-Byzantine period. Freeman excavated a test trench across the line of an ancient wall in the northern part of the village, a feature that had ear- lier been tentatively identified as part of the north- ern wall of a previously unknown Roman fort. The outcome of excavation added some weight to this inference. Two phases of wall were identified and elsewhere traces of what may have been an external tower on the northeastern angle of this circuit and a gate tower on the south side were also noted. Analysis of the excavated pottery by Robin Falkner revealed a sequence extending from, probably, the Chalcolithic/EBA to modern times. The evidence supports a Roman date for the wall, with a later remodeling. We also investigated the water-holding capacity of the Roman town that underlies Quttein. Apart from two very large reservoirs, three large cisterns were examined. The total water capacity is calculated at approximately 25,000,000 1.</page><page sequence="7">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 527 Finally, though on a small scale, further sites were sought in the vicinity. Eighteen sites were added to the 16 recorded in 1985. Notable was the size of several of these. Site 108, for example, from which the pottery is mainly Bronze Age in date, extended over 30 ha and was previously unknown. Overall, the pottery analysis suggests that most of the new sites date to the Bronze Age or Roman-Byzantine period. Especially interesting is Rukeis, site 113. The Princeton Expedition visited it in 1905 and re- corded two Safaitic inscriptions. It lies on the south side of the Wadi 'Ajib. The most significant feature is a steep fortification wall encircling the site. Pottery points to occupation in the MBA and Iron Age, but also in the Classical and Islamic periods. Also of note is site 112, a quarry bearing toolmarks and dated broadly by two Greek graffiti cut into a rock face. PREHISTORIC Tor Faraj and Wadi Aghar. Donald O. Henry, University of Tulsa, reports: In an effort to understand better the emergence of cultural modernity in hominid biocultural evolu- tion, two Palaeolithic rockshelters were investigated in the mountainous region of southern Jordan in the summer of 1993. The shelters are situated within a narrow steep-walled canyon, the Wadi Aghar. A block excavation (45 m') was begun at the Levantine Mousterian shelter of Tor Faraj, and test excavations were carried out at the early Upper Pa- laeolithic site of Wadi Aghar. The deposit at Tor Faraj is chronometrically dated through amino acid racemization and U-se- ries to ca. 70,000 B.P Earlier test excavations of the site had revealed living floors associated with high artifact densities, hearths, and ash lenses within a 1.6-m deposit. The block excavation confirms that these floors extend over a large area of the shelter and that the deposit is ca. 3 m thick. Hearths, arti- fact concentrations, and refitted artifact specimens define a floor that articulates with the "Upper C" floor of the 1983/1984 test trench and extends over much of the 1993 block excavation. This floor is sealed by a large zone of roof-fall over much of the southwest corner of the block. Beyond assisting in the definition of palaeosur- faces within the shelter, constellations of refitted ar- tifacts allow for a detailed reconstruction of the lithic reduction strategies followed by the site's inhabi- tants. These show that Levallois point production followed a lineal-preferential as opposed to recur- rent method. Moreover, conjoined specimens indi- cate that the oval shape of the chert nodules, from which most of the raw material was acquired, greatly facilitated the shaping of cores for point production. This observation may largely explain why the in- habitants of Tor Faraj appear to have targeted spe- cific chert sources high on the Ma'an Plateau some 16-20 km away for exploitation. Research at the nearby site of Wadi Aghar en- tailed the excavation of a 9-m2 area, exposing a mi- crolithic (most likely Early Hamran) occupation near the base of a steep talus slope and an early Upper Palaeolithic horizon near the top of the talus. The Upper Palaeolithic artifacts are shallowly bur- ied within a 30-cm deposit of sands, the lowest of which have been cemented within a calcium car- bonate precipitate. This assemblage is characterized by the production of large, pointed blades with convergent facet patterns that were struck from pre- dominantly single-platform cores. Platform regu- larization was rarely employed and hardhammer percussion appears to have been the dominant form of loading. Wadi el-Hasa Palaeolithic Project and North Bank Survey. G.A. Clark, Arizona State University, reports: Survey on the north bank of the Wadi el-Hasa was the major focus of the 1993 campaign. Some 453 sites were discovered, ranging in date from the Lower Palaeolithic through the Ottoman period. In contrast to the lithic-period sites found in 1992 at low elevations and associated with Pleistocene Lake Hasa, the 1993 survey produced large num- bers of ceramic-period sites, upstream in plateau and cuesta ridge contexts, and at high elevations. Particularly striking was the high incidence of Iron Age sites. Also noteworthy was the episodic reuse of particular loci in the landscape. Rujm Falah, for ex- ample, is an enormous site overlooking the Hasa with Bronze Age, Iron Age, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic period ceramics. Although its function undoubtedly changed over time, it was a convenient spot for human aggregation over thousands of years, since there is also a dense Stone Age lithic scatter surrounding the rujrm. There were apparently two periods of relatively sharp population increase in the eastern third of the Hasa drainage-the latter part of the Iron Age (1200-539 B.C.), and in the Roman and Byzantine periods (63 B.C.-A.D. 640). Most of the sites are isolated farmsteads and small hamlets comprising a few households with their corrals. This basic com- munity plan appears to exhibit remarkable tempo- ral stability: it first appears in the Chalcolithic, about 6,500 years ago, and persists into the Islamic pe- riod.</page><page sequence="8">528 GLEN L.

Wadi el-Hasa. Schematic stratigraphy and radiocarbon dates of prehistoric sites in the Wadi el-Hasa basin. The project also excavated an Upper Palaeolithic rockshelter (Yutil el-Hasa) located on the south bank of the wadi. The rockshelter was first used by humans during the late Upper Palaeolithic, about 19,000 years ago, just prior to the draining of Pleis- tocene Lake Hasa. The site was apparently not used by humans between about 19,000 and 13,000 B.P, but a series of Epipalaeolithic Madamaghan occupa- tions is then documented. Tests in these levels pro- duced thousands of tiny microlithic artifacts, which were probably replaceable elements in a variety of composite tools used for hunting and the proces- sing of animal and plant foods. By this time the lake had probably disappeared from the valley and only a perennial stream remained. There is also a late Epipalaeolithic Natufian occupation at Yutil el- Hasa, created by what were probably the last hunter-gatherers in the region. Shortly after the Natufian, we have the earliest unequivocal evidence for agriculture and for the herding of sheep and goats. The site was apparently abandoned after about 11,000 B.P and was not reoccupied. Wadi el-Hasa, Geomorphology and Prehistory. J. Schuldenrein, Geoarchaeology Research Associ- ates, reports: Interdisciplinary investigations in the Wadi el- Hasa have uncovered a broad range of prehistoric sites spanning the Middle Palaeolithic through Epi- palaeolithic periods (120,000-9,000 B.P). A major component of this research has been the reconstruc- tion of Palaeolithic landscapes through geomor- phological study. Initial indications are that climatic cycles were partially responsible for the changing settlement trends and preservation gradients across this portion of the Levant. A series of radiocarbon dates and laboratory analyses of sediments were used to refine chronologies established through ar- tifact analysis and link site geography with regional cycles of moisture and aridity. The landscape ar- chaeology study of the Wadi el-Hasa is the first of its kind for the Late Quaternary east of the Jordan Rift Valley. The representative stratigraphy linking the larger open-air sites is depicted in figure 4. Wadi</page><page sequence="9">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 529 el-Hasa is the principal perennial drainage of the Jordanian interior and empties into the Rift Valley. The principal archaeological sites tend to cluster along the lake perimeter, and range from Upper Palaeolithic (Ahmarian) to Epipalaeolithic (Ke- baran, Natufian; 25,000-9,000 B.P). Earlier Upper and Middle Palaeolithic sites have been identified at higher, mountainous elevations. They do not articu- late with lake deposits because former high-water stands eroded older sites. We have projected that since circum-Mediterranean lake levels peaked around 40,000 years ago, that period represents the highest levels of Lake Hasa as well. In 1992 investigations downstream of the main cluster of Hasa sites, at the Wadi Ali, refined the stratigraphy of WHS 634, a Middle Palaeolithic rockshelter. To date, that site contains the oldest stratified archaeological deposits in Jordan. The 1993 field season focused on mapping the extent and stratigraphy of the late Pleistocene Lake Hasa. The ongoing research along the Wadi el-Hasa is generating baseline models of landscape and occu- pational history for the southern Levant east of the Jordan Rift. Preliminary comparisons with palaeo- ecological reconstructions of the neighboring Rift Valley and Negev deserts suggest that linked cli- matic pulses and settlement trends correlate with various intervals of the Upper Pleistocene, when Pleniglacial conditions were favorable for occupa- tion. Ahmarian and Epipalaeolithic hunter-gath- erer groups apparently dominated alluvial fan and lake margin landscapes across the southern Levant. The el-Hasa research suggests that synchronous Le- vantine models are a basis for expanding our knowledge of palaeoecological patterning eastward across the Arabian desert. Feinan. Thomas Engel, Wolfgang Frey, and Harald Kfirschner, Institut ffir Systematische Bo- tanik und Pflanzengeographie, Freie Universitat, Berlin, report: Feinan, situated in the Wadi Araba, is, along with Timna and Cyprus, one of the most important cen- ters of early metal production in the Near East. Early copper mining took place at Feinan from the Chalcolithic through the Mamluk period, as is shown by a large number of slag heaps, and it reached its zenith during the Iron Age. These slag heaps, which partly are rich in charcoal, rose during the EBA and indicate the vital part Feinan played in early copper production in the area. During the Iron Age, the slags reached a volume of more than 100,000 tons, and the metal production was in the range of 5,000-10,000 tons. To produce such an amount of copper by ore smelting, about 300,000- 400,000 tons of charcoal are needed. This is difficult to imagine, considering the lack of dense forests in the area today. The project focuses on three questions: Which species were used as natural resources for copper- ore smelting processes? Are there differences within the spectra of the species in different historical peri- ods? To which formations do these species belong, and are they indicative of a deforestation or a cli- matic change? During three field seasons we collected thousands of charcoal fragments from different smelting peri- ods, which had been preserved relatively well among the slags. First results have shown that dur- ing the different copper-ore smelting periods dif- ferent species had been used as firewood. In the EBA, Juniperus phoenicea, Quercus calliprinos, Olea cf. europaea, and Pistacia cf. atlantica were the main fire- woods. These species cannot be found in the close vicinity of Feinan today. At the beginning of the Iron Age, and especially during the Persian and Roman periods, the charcoal spectra from Feinan reveal high quantities of species that are still frequent in the Feinan area (e.g., Tamarix sp., Phoenix dactylifera, Acacia sp., Retama raetam, Haloxylon persicum). In ad- dition to the surface collections of charcoal, separate samples were taken from sections through the slag heaps. If one excludes the importation of wood for ore smelting processes during the EBA, the charcoal spectra suggest that during the Neolithic period and the EBA a climatic change to somewhat more humid conditions can be postulated, causing a southern migration of the mesophilous, Mediter- ranean woodlands and a forest depression in the plateau region. This corresponds with recent inves- tigations in Northern Africa and Israel, but con- trasts with the common view, which is based on the few palynological data available from the northern Levant. 'Ain Ghazal. Zeidan A. Kafafi, Yarmouk Univer- sity, and Gary Rollefson report: Under the sponsorship of the Institute of Archae- ology and Anthropology of Yarmouk University and the Peabody Museum, Harvard University, a six-week season of excavations sampled more than 250 m2 in the north and central fields of 'Ain Ghazal. LPPNB layers. The aim of the efforts in the north field was to investigate Late Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (LPPNB; ca. 6,500-6,000 B.C.) architecture and cultural deposits. In addition to the exposure of an</page><page sequence="10">530 GLEN L. PETERMAN [AJA 98 Fig. 5. 'Ain Ghazal. View of the four-phase LPPNB cult building. (Photo Y. Zo'bi) LPPNB house and associated courtyard wall, a four- phase structure was encountered just below the modern land surface (fig. 5). The earliest phase (P-I) was poorly preserved. P-II included a shallow-arced apse wall at the western end, which evidently began to collapse inward. In P-III a straight wall was erected across the interior of the apse, changing the building shape to rectangular. Phase IV consisted of a circular room 2.5 m in diameter, with a doorway leading to a badly damaged antechamber to the east. The red painted P-IV lime plaster floor in- cluded seven or eight episodes of reflooring imme- diately above the previous one. A large hole (65 cm) dominated the center of the P-IV floor, much too large to have served as a post- hole for so small a building. The plaster curved up against the edge of the hole on the northeast side, indicating a former installation. In the walls of the hole were two pairs of stone-lined subfloor channels (north-south and northeast-southwest) that may have served as air ducts leading into the hole from outside the walls. The apse shape for P-II and the circular form for P-IV are unique for the LPPNB, and it seems that the building probably served a ritual purpose. Yarmoukian layers. With the end of the 1993 sea- son, there are now more than 850 m2 of Yarmoukian deposits exposed at 'Ain Ghazal, the largest area for any Yarmoukian settlement. For the final phase of the Yarmoukian occupation at 'Ain Ghazal, a com- plete circular structure (ca. 4.5 m diameter) was ex- posed. Near the entrance (to the northeast) were two low, stone-paved areas on the interior, and there was possibly a central posthole. The continuous wall was, for the most part, a single stone thick, suggest- ing a temporary structure used by pastoralists who visited the site on a seasonal basis. One of the most striking discoveries of the season was a walled street 2.5 m wide that led up the hill (east-west) in a series of stone steps, traceable for 12 m (fig. 6). Two 1-m-wide gateways in the north wall, set off from the street by a low stone curb, probably led into courtyards. The street was intensively used by Yarmoukian inhabitants, but it still remains pos- sible that the feature was originally a PPNC con- struction, perhaps contemporaneous with the large wall 15-20 m to the south. Finally, the discovery of a pink-purple flint quarry in the Wadi Umm Huweijir, 2 km north of 'Ain Ghazal, may have resolved the enigma of the source of this raw material so popular in MPPNB and LPPNB times throughout the southern Levant. 'Ain Ghazal. Jane Peterson, ACOR USIA Fellow, Arizona State University, reports: During the summer of 1993 the human skeletal material from 'Ain Ghazal was analyzed as part of a larger project to track changes in the sexual division of labor across the transition from foraging econo- mies to those dependent on domestic plants and animals. Inferences about the activities of the pre- historic population at 'Ain Ghazal are based on both cultural and osteological material. Stone and ce- ramic artifacts, as well as plant and animal remains, help to reconstruct a partial range of past activities. Within this general framework, muscle attachment sites (enthesopathies) on bones can identify which individuals or groups were responsible for certain activities. In previous studies, specific activities such as hunting with a spear or atl-atl, hunting with bow and arrow, burden bearing, and cereal processing have been linked to specific patterns of frequency and robusticity of muscle attachments. 'Ain Ghazal is particularly important because it is a huge settlement inhabited by one of the Levant's early farming groups. Domestic and wild species of cereals and legumes have been identified. The fau- nal remains also indicate a mixed economic strategy, with both wild and domestic animals represented. The skeletal material belongs to various phases of the PPN and was recovered from beneath house floors and in trash middens. At this large Neolithic site, one might reasonably expect that labor pat- terns are in a period of adjustment; adapting not only to life in larger, more sedentary communities, but also to a new suite of tasks associated with pro- ducing plant and animal products. Preliminary analysis indicates that the 'Ain Ghazal skeletons provide insights into changing labor pat- terns. In general, the musculature in the arm and shoulder region for the individuals examined ap- pears to be quite robust. Both men and women have very robust biceps brachii attachments. The biceps</page><page sequence="11">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 531 Fig. 6. 'Ain Ghazal. View of the walled street in the central field. muscle is the principal agent responsible for flexing the elbow, but can also be involved during supina- tion. The pattern is bilateral, with strong expression on both the right and left sides. One activity infer- ence being considered is carrying heavy loads with bent arms. The costoclavicular ligament on the clav- icle is also quite robust and exhibits stress lesions in some cases, particularly among the men. The 'Ain Ghazal skeletons also appear very similar to skeletal samples from other PPN sites. At Ha- toula, for example, some individuals exhibit a simi- lar pattern of strongly expressed biceps brachii and costoclavicular attachments. This pattern extends back into the earlier Natufian period as well. Some of the human osteological material from the sites of Hayonim Cave, el-Wad, Kebara, and 'Ain Mallaha have similar characteristics. The 'Ain Ghazal popu- lation, however, differs from the Natufian groups with respect to other patterns in the muscle attach- ment sites. For instance, muscle patterns seem to differ more noticeably, both in type and degree, be- tween men and women in Natufian samples. I would posit that sexual dimorphic muscle patterns are more pronounced in Natufian groups, and di- minish among the PPN groups, including the popu- lation from 'Ain Ghazal. A scarcity of human skeletons dating to the Pot- tery Neolithic inhibits comparisons between 'Ain Ghazal and samples from the following time period. The teres major muscle is quite pronounced, how- ever, in several of the Pottery Neolithic individuals, a pattern not obvious among the inhabitants at 'Ain Ghazal. Teres major draws the humerus downward and back, medially rotates the arm, and assists in drawing the trunk forward when the arm is fixed. Grinding using a quern (or slab) and handstone would certainly involve this motion. It is possible that up until the Pottery Neolithic period, cereal processing activities were not regular, or consistent enough, to leave identifiable signatures on the skeletons. Azraq Oasis. David Gilbertson, University of Sheffield, and John Grattan, University of Ply- mouth, report: The archaeology and palaeoenvironmental his- tory of arid lands are subjects of compelling con- cern, especially given the pivotal positions occupied by some semiarid lands in major events in human history and prehistory. In studies of floodwater farming and environmental change, the Azraq Oa- sis offers notable challenges, and opportunities. It has daily summer temperatures averaging 37-40' C, receives less than 100 mm of precipitation per year, and is one of the two great oases of the Syrian desert. Coring and palynological and geochemical studies already reported in Studies in the History and Archaeology ofJordan 2 reveal a history of fluctuating depositional environments, characterized by either calcareous, saline, lacustrine shell muds or variously decomposed biogenic freshwater marsh deposits. The Wadi el-Enoqiyah drains into the Azraq basin from the north. Fieldwalking along its course re- vealed the presence of two areas-'Ain el-Enoqui- yah and 'Ain el-Sol-where water harvesting had</page><page sequence="12">532 GLEN L. PETERMAN [AJA 98 ' . t I': ", Fig. 7. Er-Rahib. PPNB lithics: 1) naviform core; and 2) single-platform core. been practiced on a notable scale in the Late Roman or Early Islamic period; the precise dating is uncer- tain. Check dams, barrages, cutoffs, canals, corrals, and settlement structures were identified and mapped. The overall pattern of water use from spring and trapped floodwater for irrigation was estimated. Such water-control structures appear to be relatively uncommon in this area, and in any case need to be distinguished from the "kite" wall sys- tems for which the area is well known. We also set out to explore the longer-term history of the Azraq basin, which has experienced major changes in lake level and climate, leaving a legacy of complex Pleistocene soils and deposits, some of which are associated with Palaeolithic artifacts. The rapid identification of deposits of similar facies but differing antiquity is obviously crucial in this area. Simple textural and geochemical properties of 34 sets of Pleistocene deposits chosen by Andrew Gar- rard were investigated in the laboratory. The results were then subjected to statistical analyses designed to detect whether any coherent groupings of prop- erties occurred that could be related to the known antiquity of the source materials. Some results were obvious. Basalt-derived materials were clearly dis- tinguished from those derived from limestone bed- rock. More interesting was the identification of subgroups that differed in their properties in a manner related to their age, presumably reflecting the impacts of pedogenic processes through time. Er-Rahib. Cecilia Conati Barbaro, Universith di Roma, "La Sapienza," reports: The PPNB site ofer-Rahib lies on a terraced slope (530 masl) in the Wadi el-Yabis valley in northern Jordan. It was first identified during the surveys of the Wadi el-Yabis Project in 1990 and a test excava- tion was carried out in summer 1992. An in situ deposit, consisting of a 1-m-thick strati- graphic sequence, was excavated. One structure was found and partially excavated. This structure has an</page><page sequence="13">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 533 Fig. 8. Adh-Dhra'. EBA monolithic pillar site. oval or apsidal shape and is formed by a two-course stone wall composed of large stones with a fill of earth, smaller stones, and pebbles. The floor and the internal part of the wall were covered by plaster that was well preserved in the southeast part of the test unit. Some fragments of polished plaster (black and red), daub, and clay lumps were found above the floor and near the wall. The majority of artifacts and faunal remains were recovered in the deposit lying outside the structure. From a preliminary analysis of the animal bones, sheep and goat seem to be the most commonly rep- resented species. The lithic industry is mostly made out of a fine- grained chert. Obsidian is quite rare. Only five de- bitage elements and two retouched blades were found. The high percentage of core-trimming ele- ments, chunks and chips (80% of the total debitage), from this restricted area of excavation suggests that part of the chipping activity took place in loco. Among tools, retouched blades and bladelets are the most frequently represented class (37.9% of tools). Sickle elements made from denticulate blades are present. Some points were reused as sickle elements; burins and burin spalls are repre- sented, some also made from points. Some points show small burin blows on their distal end that might have been caused by the impact (fig. 7). Points are another well-represented tool class (9.5% of tools) of which Jericho and Byblos points are the most numerous. Helwan points are also present, as are bifacial tools and some polished arti- facts, mainly axes. One small ax made of greenstone and another of basalt with traces of ocher were found. The list of finds also includes groundstone arti- facts, such as two shaft straighteners, one fragment of a bowl, and grinding stones and pestles. Some necklace elements have also been recovered: a few perforated shells (Tellina sp., Cyprea sp.) and beads (one made of greenstone). On the basis of the preliminary analysis of cul- tural remains, er-Rahib has been dated to the mid- dle-late PPNB period. BRONZE AGE Explorations in adh-Dhrai'. Carsten Kbrber, Ger- man Protestant Institute for Archaeology, reports: Survey in the ghor adh-Dhra' (fig. 8) was con- ducted in the area along the Wadi adh-Dhra' as far north as the mouth of the Wadi al-Karak where it reaches the plain. Two fortifications were found above adh-Dhra'. Khirbet Wadi adh-Dhra' (north) is situated above the northern bank of the Wadi adh- Dhra'. The strongly fortified summit of this hill is 100 m long and 30 m wide. Another strongly for- tified rocky plateau, Khirbet Wadi adh-Dhra' (south), is situated above adh-Dhra'. This fortifica- tion is U-shaped in plan with dimensions of 130 m in length and about 80 m in width. Surface pottery</page><page sequence="14">534 GLEN L. PETERMAN [AJA 98 sherds of both strongholds indicate they were used during the EBA. Near the confluence of the Wadis al-Karak and adh-Dhra', Tell Haddad was examined. This site produced pottery from the EBA, the MBA, and the Iron Age. Walls were detected on the surface. The major site of Buleda was carefully investigated, dated by pottery to EB II and III. The size and extent of the remains suggest that it was an impor- tant EB II/III city in the Southern Ghors. A ne- cropolis belonging to this city was located to the southwest of Buleda. Attention was primarily paid to the exploration of a site with a monolithic pillar, 500 m south of the southern bank of the Wadi adh-Dhrfi' on a narrow ridge that slopes steeply to the north and south. The ancient architectural remains here include a stand- ing stone monument, a stone wall nearly 400 m long, and some tumuli. The flat and broad monolith is erected on an artificial terrace on the slope of the hillside. The stone is only roughly worked. In the EBA structures enclosed the monolithic stele and connected it to a 400-m-long, 2-m-wide main wall. Domestic areas were located to the east. Other in- stallations stood within the EB quarters such as a small masseba. The long wall that extends down the hill from east to west could be the remains of an encircling wall for the area, between the monolithic pillar site and the Wadi adh-Dhra', or could repre- sent the foundations of a staircase leading up to the standing stone monument. Under the foundation of this wall Chalcolithic pottery was found. The results of the fieldwork allow the history of the monolithic pillar site to emerge. The standing stone monument was probably a place of cultic significance in the fourth millennium B.C. The presence of Chalcolithic ceramics also suggests oc- cupation of this area at this time. In the third mil- lennium B.C. the erection of the long wall was completed. The place of the standing stone monu- ment was then associated with the wall and was probably used as a sanctuary in association with dif- ferent, perhaps cultic, installations. Further work is planned for 1994. Tell el-Handaquq (south). M. Chesson and I. Kuijt, Harvard University, report: Research at Tell el-Handaquq is focused on the excavation and analysis of domestic structures. Un- til now, most research on the EBA in Jordan has centered on fortification systems and public struc- tures, and studies of changing settlement patterns have been based on estimations of site size. Re- searchers have only recently looked at domestic contexts to investigate specifically the effects of ag- gregation and dispersal on community social and economic organization. The project's 1993 season had three goals: to determine the occupational his- tory of the site; to delineate the extent of the site and identify domestic and public architecture; and to conduct soundings in domestic structures to deter- mine the suitability of this site for future research on EBA domestic life. Located on a foothill rising from the Jordan Val- ley floor on the southern bank of the Wadi Zarqa, Tell el-Handaquq (south) is surrounded on three sides by agricultural fields. The substantial water supply, in the form of the nearby river and springs, has insured a level of resource stability that en- hances the area's viability for settlement. Extensive stone architectural remains are visible on the surface across the entire site, which is esti- mated to be 10 ha in size. Numerous architectural features were identified, including seven large tow- ers with associated connecting walls, two dolmens, and multiple room blocks formed by numerous in- tersecting walls. A surface survey produced EB I-IV materials but EB II-III ceramics predominate. On the basis of survey, the site appears to have been a large, fortified EB II-III city, with occupation pre- ceding and following its urban phase. Three excavation units were opened in area A. Unit 1 revealed a multiphased building (structure I) of small stone walls, with multiple plaster floors. The ceramics suggest an EB III date for the con- struction and utilization of the structure through all four phases. Pottery recovered from beneath the original floor was dated to EB II-III. Unit 2 was opened to the east of structure I in an attempt to recover another domestic structure. A cobbled sur- face was discovered abutting the western wall. The ceramics recovered suggest a broad EB III date. Unit 3 was opened to the southwest of structure I, providing evidence of multiple phases of occupa- tion as in structure I. Future fieldwork will focus on the exposure of domestic architecture and mapping of the site. Tell esh-Shuna. G. Philip, University of Durham, and D. Baird, Edinburgh University, report: The overall aim of the Shuna Project is to docu- ment the development of the site from the fifth to the third millennium B.C. Excavations continued in 1993 on the upper tell (area A) and on the lower tell (area D). Four walls of building 1, (area A) had been ex- posed by the end of the 1992 season. The eastward expansion of area A in 1993 revealed a fifth wall,</page><page sequence="15">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 535 Wal 24 Wna 36 w :19 Wall 369 Soo 500 570 49s ?ti~ 55 37 '~ 0 1 2 3 4 5m TELL ESH-SHUNA NORTH r+5`15 -. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4"O , L Fig. 9. Tell esh-Shuna. Plan of area A, building 1. 369, on which was set a large limestone slab, similar to the three excavated earlier (fig. 9). Unlike the other walls, 139 bore a mud superstructure. Be- cause this superstructure was plastered on each side, it functioned as an internal dividing wall and the new slab therefore lay in a separate room from those previously encountered. The stone slabs are probably bases for pillars or roof supports. The three walls on which these were set were all overlain by plaster floors that ran up to the edges of the rectangular boss in the center of each slab. These floors, which ran up to the plaster face of wall 139, clearly indicate that the rooms were inside a build- ing. In the southeast part of area A, a 2.6-m-wide stone wall (378) is perpendicular to the five walls and probably marks the southern limits of the build- ing. Set against the outer (southern) face of this wall are two additional stone walls: the inner wall is 1.5 m wide; the outer 2.6 m wide. With wall 378, these walls form a massive outer wall, ca. 7.5 m in thick- ness. All the walls are founded directly over late EB I deposits, with no foundation trenches. Below the western part of building 1, several phases of late EB I occupation have been identified, including building 3, which shows evidence of re- construction. Contemporary with this building was a rubbish deposit that produced a variety of faunal, botanical, and ceramic material, as well as metal- working debris, including fragments of clay molds and processing vessels. This is the first metallurgical evidence from an EB I settlement site in this region. Excavation of area D was completed in 1993, with natural gravels reached throughout the area. The ceramics from the lowest levels are within the Chal- colithic tradition, although the assemblage is not classic Ghassulian. Its chronological position will be- come clearer after the processing of 14C samples. Tell Nimrin. James W. Flanagan, Case Western Reserve University, David W. McCreery, Willamette University, and Khair N. Yassine, University ofJor- dan, report: The Tell Nimrin Project seeks to document the site's occupational sequence and to reconstruct the environmental and agricultural history of Nimrin and its immediate environs. Excavations were con- ducted in 1989, 1990, and 1993. Tell Nimrin is lo- cated on the eastern edge of the village of South Shuna, in the southern Jordan Valley. The earliest signs of occupation are small domes- tic structures (fig. 10), built directly on alluvial gravel, dating to late EB IV/early MB I (ca. 2000 B.C.). Several phases of MB domestic structures on the site's northern edge stand directly above. Near the end of the MB period (ca. 1600 B.C.), large stone walls with mudbrick superstructures were built on top of the small domestic structures. The largest stand more than 4 m high and 3 m wide and may be from a large public building or city fortifica- tion. Nimrin's Iron Age sequence is well preserved. No clear evidence from the LBA and early Iron Age I (ca. 1500-1000 B.C.) has been found, and the presence of late Iron Age I walls built immediately</page><page sequence="16">536 GLEN L. PETERMAN [AJA 98 Fig. 10. Tell Nimrin. Road-cut showing Middle Bronze Age stone and mudbrick walls. over MB II structures suggests an occupational gap during the second half of the second millennium B.C. During the Iron Age, Tell Nimrin appears to have suffered destructions followed by short periods of abandonment and reoccupation. Well-preserved mudbrick and stone walls, some still covered with plaster facing, date to the tenth, ninth, and seventh centuries B.C. Numerous ceramics, mostly storage jars, were found associated with the Iron Age struc- tures along with large quantities of plant remains, including whole carbonized figs, linseeds, wheat, barley, olive, lentils, chickpeas, and a variety of other foodstuffs. The Persian period is represented on the top of the mound by a multiphase building in which eight Aramaic ostraca were found. Domestic architecture, ceramics, and living surfaces dating to the Persian period were also found on the western slopes. Hellenistic and Roman ceramics attest to occupa- tion during these periods but thus far no structures dating to this era have been uncovered because of modern bulldozing. The western slope of the site holds the greatest potential for finding relatively in- tact strata of the Hellenistic and later periods. Tell Nimrin flourished during the Byzantine and Islamic eras, especially the Umayyad and Mamluk periods. Numerous Mamluk sugar pots and a mill race located to the northeast of the tell testify to the Jordan Valley's well-known sugar cane industry during the Mamluk period. Remains from the Byz- antine period include numerous walls on the site's western slope as well as a late sixth-century A.D. church excavated by the DAJ in 1980. The most unusual Byzantine find from the 1993 excavation was a cache of 34 gold coins and two pairs of ear- rings. The cache was found in a small ceramicjuglet that had been deposited above the floor of an aban- doned Byzantine building. The coins were struck during the reigns of the emperors Valens, Valentini- anus I, Leo, Zeno, Basciliscus, and Anastasius. Tell Abu al-Kharaz. Peter M. Fischer, University of G6teborg, reports: A detailed topographic map of Tell Abu al-Kharaz was completed in advance of the 1992 season of excavation. Excavations were carried out from Oc- tober to November 1992. A new area (area 3) was opened west of the summit within the assumed boundaries of an Iron Age citadel (see AJA 97 [1993] 477-78). Material culture remains from the EBA, LBA, and Iron Age were found. Late EB I-II strata were found, usually undis- turbed, directly below the LBA strata. The EB I period is represented by painted wares (line-group painting), burnished wares, and various "band-slip" and "wash" wares. These wares, and the absence of "metallic" burnished ware (see ADAJ 37, 1993) and Abydos ware, suggest a tentative date of EB IB. Two phases can be distinguished within EB II: a main phase of intensive building activity (see ADAJ 37, 1993), and a later phase of squatter occupation. The main phase is represented by mudbrick houses on stone foundations containing utilitarian objects. Three sickles, each manufactured of seven flint knives mounted in a piece of curved wood, and a stone mace-head were also found. The main phase came to a violent end, indicated by a substantial ash and destruction layer covering the whole area. A tentative date for the main phase is the early part of EB II, based on the presence of the "metal- lic" burnished and Abydos wares. The presence of band-slip or grain-wash wares could not be used to distinguish between the two phases, since they were found in both EB I and II strata.</page><page sequence="17">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 537 Fig. 11. Tell Abu al-Kharaz. Bone handle (?) from Iron Age II destruction layer. Extensive building activities throughout the Iron Age unfortunately destroyed the LBA strata within the upper part of the tell. Many walls built during the LBA were later reused during the Iron Age. LB I pottery, exemplified by a chocolate-on-white ware, is present as are finds belonging to LB II such as a Cypriot White-Slip II "milk bowl" and a pendant of a white stone with an ibex-tree motif, which was used as a stamp. Architectural remains belonging to the Iron Age I period were discovered for the first time on the tell. Massive walls and stone pavements point to the presence of a citadel during that period. Thick strata belonging to the Iron Age IIC period were also found across the entire area. A system of well- constructed and massive walls, perhaps part of a defensive system, was exposed. A well-preserved and nearly complete goblet-shaped bone object was found within a destruction layer (fig. 11). It is elabo- rate and shows two carved sphinxes. Close parallels have been found in the Burnt Palace at Nimrud. A painted terracotta head of a male, very likely part of an anthropomorphic vessel, was also found. The style resembles the Greek-Cypriot kouros type. Tell el-Fukhar. John Strange, University of Co- penhagen, reports: The major discovery of the fourth season of exca- vation at Tell el-Fukhar was a monumental public building built in the LB IB-IIB period, ca. 1450- 1300 B.C., which was destroyed as part of a massive destruction at the end of the period. In the debris were found imported Mycenaean cups and jars, a faience bowl and bottle, a unique glass female figu- rine pendant, a glazed pottery "ornamental knob," an iron fitting, and one of the largest pithoi ever discovered in the area. This remarkable array of materials attests to a high standard of living and indicates the presence of a palatial residence, domi- nating the highest point of the tell in the LBA. Walls were over a meter thick and a pillar (1 m in section</page><page sequence="18">538 GLEN L. PETERMAN [AJA 98 Fig. 12. Amman. Excavations on the Citadel.

Also exposed from this pe- riod and reconstructed in the transitional LB-early Iron Age (ca. 1200-1150 B.C.) was the main city gateway. A deep sounding to bedrock provides the first extensive stratigraphic sequence for northern Jor- dan. Nine floors of the EBA, the earliest (dating to ca. 3000-2850 B.C.) being the finest, were exca- vated. An MB IIA tomb (ca. 1900-1800 B.C.), with an adult in flexed position and a child above, con- tained three complete vessels that are among the earliest known to have been wheelmade. Then fol- low the LBA building; transitional LB-early Iron and Iron IA-B (ca. 1150-1050 B.C.) walls and ta- buns of poor construction; Persian silos; and a Hel- lenistic villa of the third century B.C. IRON AGE Tell Jawa. PM. Daviau, Wilfrid Laurier Univer- sity, and S. Thibodeau report: Examination of the ceramics from the excavations indicates that the tell was occupied from the MBA to the middle of Iron Age II. After a gap in settlement, occupation resumed and several structures on the tell, along with associated installations in the bed- rock outcrops to the south, were in use during the Late Byzantine-Early Islamic period. During 1993, work continued in fields B, C, and E in order to expose further Iron Age structures inside the casemate wall system. New features of the wall came to light in fields B and E and domestic structures were found in all three fields. Field E produced a courtyard, with central cistern, sur- rounded by rooms. These rooms were full of smashed pottery, grinding stones, and other imple- ments. Some 147 vessels were recovered. The pillared building discovered earlier in field C also produced significant domestic finds. The broad room at the back of the building was a food prepa- ration area filled with lamps, cooking pots, storejars, ground stone tools, and some ceramic spindle whorls and unbaked clay loomweights. In the cen- tral room was a stone staircase that led up to a landing. The fabric of this structure included boulder-and-chink walls and standing limestone pillars with cross walls built of cobblestones. In field C, another area of domestic quarters was uncovered that contained a tannur and various kitchen imple- ments. A Late Byzantine-Early Islamic period building in field D provided some of the most fascinating dis- coveries of the 1993 season. Under a kitchen floor were found 35 copper coins minted in Damascus and Ramla. The remains of a textile pouch were found adhering to the edges of the coins. The court- yard in the center of the building was paved with a plain mosaic floor that ran under the remains of an arch flanked by a doorway. A small plaster-lined cis- tern is located against the north wall of the court. Among the artifacts found in this room was an im- pressive collection of Umayyad painted pottery ves- sels, as well as many Umayyad or Abbasid lamps decorated with the grape leaf-and-cluster design. Several lamps are inscribed in Greek and Arabic scripts.</page><page sequence="19">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 539 Two burials were also excavated. The first, in field B, contained beads and a copper fibula with paral- lels to finds from the Persian period. The second burial, in field C-East, was of a young child interred in a stone cist grave, with a stone for a pillow. No artifacts were found with this burial. Amman Citadel. Ahmad Moumani, University of Jordan, Anthi Koutsoukou, ACOR, and Glen Peter- man, ACOR, report: Excavations on the Citadel (ebel el-Qal'a) in Am- man were first conducted between 1930 and 1938 by the Missione Italiana in Amman. Further archae- ological work was carried out in the 1960s and 1970s by the DAJ and ACOR (R. Dornemann) and also by C.-M. Bennett and A.E. Northedge. In 1990, excavations were resumed by Mohammed Najjar, Khair Yassine, and Rudolph Dornemann under the auspices of ACOR and the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. In 1991-1992, the directors were Mo- hammed Najjar and the late Kenneth Russell of ACOR. A final season of excavation in April 1993 under the direction of the authors uncovered part of a large Iron Age structure below the Roman temple (fig. 12). It measures at least 7 x 21 m and was cut in half by the foundations of the eastern end of the Roman temple. The Iron Age structure, from which were recovered large quantities of pottery, was con- structed of very large stones (up to 2 m long) and had a well-preserved plaster floor. There was no pottery lying directly upon the floor-only in earth layers above it-and it thus seems that the structure was devoid of pottery when it went out of use, indi- cating that it was probably not a domestic structure. Iron Age ceramics were also recovered from be- neath the plastered floor. It has been suggested that this structure may be the temple of Milkom, the god or king of ancient Rabbah, which was sacked by David according to 2 Sam. 12:26-31 and 1 Chron. 20:1-3. This is an in- triguing possibility. The Roman-period temple (see below) was built directly above its remains, perhaps indicating that the area was sacred also in pre- Roman times. Unfortunately, however, no artifac- tual material was recovered that might give some indication of the function of the structure. The larger excavation project is in process of be- ing published by ACOR as The Great Temple of Am- man: The Excavations, by A. Koutsoukou, M. Najjar, and K. Russell. Jebel al-Kser. Manfred Lindner, Naturhistorische Gesellschaft, Nuremberg, reports: During the archaeological survey of the greater Petra region in 1992, a team of the Naturhistor- ische Gesellschaft (NHG), Nuremberg, under the author's direction discovered a fortified mountain stronghold yielding exclusively Iron Age II (Edom- ite) pottery. Rock-cut house foundations, a long- house, cisterns, deep basins, and a presumed cultic monument with an offering place are important features of the site. The walls are built on ledges, of well-cut ashlar blocks, where the natural defenses did not seem sufficient to the people of the seventh century B.C. Jebel al-Kser, as the site is called by the bedouin, belongs to a series of Edomite mountain strong- holds in southern Jordan, two of which were discov- ered before by teams of the NHG (see ADAJ 31 [1987]; 32 [1988]; 34 [1990]). In contrast to Ba'ja III and Umm el-Ala (es-Sadeh), however, the newly found site combines all the characteristics of strong- holds in the region. Tell Safut. Donald H. Wimmer, Seton Hall Uni- versity, reports: Tell Safut, long known for the presence of MBA and LBA remains, has also produced evidence of late Iron Age occupation. Domestic architecture from this period was found in area A on the south- ern side of the tell, which is much gentler than the other sides and closest to the site's water supply-a series of springs near the base of the tell. Because the site is ideally situated to oversee the agricultur- ally productive Baqa'a Valley below, Iron Age re- mains are also anticipated on the summit of the tell. Previous excavations in area A yielded several rooms in a casemate wall that was further fortified Fig. 13. Tell Safut. Partially excavated passageway at the base of the tower. (Photo R.

One casemate chamber was a two- roomed complex with white plastered walls and floor. An assemblage of ceramics was found here, crushed under a collapsed second-story floor. No signs of plastering were evident in adjacent rooms to the west. Excavation to the east did not reveal similar architecture. Instead of another room, only the site perimeter walls appeared, without cross walls. The extent of the perimeter walls was traced to the steep northern slopes of the tell to determine the nature and extent of the Iron II presence. A probe (area F) was placed astride the presumed path of the buried perimeter wall, and indeed a casemate wall-perhaps a counterpart to the one in area A-was found. One cross wall was exposed, in addition to a 1-m2 tower that was integrated into the inner side of the outer wall. A small opening at the base that rested on bedrock provided access to the tower from inside the wall (fig. 13). It seems likely that the function of the tower was to provide a van- tage point for overseeing the security of the perime- ter wall itself. Other defensive structures were noted during ex- cavation. A type ofglacis, formed by covering a mass of stones with a thin layer of compacted limestone, was noted at the base of one perimeter wall. In conclusion, the Iron II archaeological remains indicate the relative importance of Tell Safut. Be- cause only a reduced area of the site was elaborately protected, however, we suggest that the lateral ex- tent of Iron II occupation was smaller than other- wise might be expected. NABATAEAN AND ROMAN Khirbet edh-Darih. Zeidoun Al-Muheisen, Yar- mouk University, and Francois Villeneuve, IFAPO, report: Five seasons of excavations have been carried out at Khirbet edh-Darih since 1984 (fig. 14). The main structures uncovered on this Nabataean site include</page><page sequence="21">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 541 Fig. 15. Khirbet edh-Darih. The Nabataean temple. a temple and a palace as well as a number of houses and agricultural installations such as oil and wine presses. Several burials were also located in two ar- eas. Excavations were carried out in the frontal area of the temple, which leads to the cella through stairs located on both sides (fig. 15). Here, a paved floor was uncovered that connects to the corridors sur- rounding the inner part of the temple. Numerous plaster pieces were found, some of which were deco- rated with frescoes. Stones with floral and geomet- rical motifs were also collected. Research was also conducted in the eastern area, where a side gate was found in addition to the tem- ple's paved floor. Conservation has already begun of the walls of the room located to the northwestern side of the temple. The area in front of the temple was also exca- vated. The presence of rooms and various Islamic- period buildings located in the southwestern corner of the yard indicates that it was used for habitation during the Umayyad and later periods. In the Byz- antine period, the temple was used as a church and the yard was devoted to housing. Excavations were also conducted in the palace. Three rooms, connected to a rectangular structure, were uncovered and partially cleared. The rooms appear to be part of the ground floor, for remains of materials belonging to an upper floor were found above the room walls. Inside the rooms Nabataean coins, pottery, and other material were found, dat- ing to the first century A.D. The building was also used in later periods. A structure at the forefront of the ground floor rooms was also exposed. It is a large rectangular hall covered by arches that stood on central stone pillars. This hall is connected to another arched building by a gate located on its northwestern side. The latter building consists of a large rectangular room, a tri- clinium, in which benches are built along the west- ern and southeastern walls. The foundations of the arches that supported the ceiling of the triclinium</page><page sequence="22">542 GLEN L. PETERMAN [AJA 98 NORTH N-W COMPLEX N.

In the southern wall six rectangular niches, perhaps used for storage, were found. This structure is one of the very rare Nabataean stone-built triclinia. Ex- cept for the banquet rooms found at Khirbet et-Tan- nur, all the Nabataean triclinia identified at present are cut into the living rock. In other areas (to the southeast of the village and in area 6) a Nabataean house built on Edomite re- mains was found, in addition to multiroomed struc- tures of unknown function, but used during the Nabataean and Islamic periods. Excavations were also continued in cemetery B. In past seasons a number of single, stone-built tombs were found in addition to individual graves built of cut limestone blocks. Skeletons were found to be wrapped in leather and carefully sewn fabrics, some of them decorated with designs. A study of the remains should provide more information about Nabataean burial customs and their knowledge of the embalm- ing arts and mummification. Petra, Temple of the Winged Lions. P Hammond and D. Johnson, University of Utah, report: The American Expedition to Petra concentrated in 1993 on reconstruction and stabilization activities in the residential quarters of the Temple of the Winged Lions (fig. 16) and on the altar platform of the cella, with excavation conducted in various squares in order to clarify data required for future reconstruction. Reconstruction work was directed by Dakhlallah Qublan. A sounding was made in site 111.7 to determine the height of the imposts in the liwan area. Excavation proceeded 3.5 m down to the floor, and provided information for the calculation of recon- struction needs, and indicated the extent of excava-</page><page sequence="23">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 543 tion still required to reach the floor of the liwan in site 111.9/111.6 to the west. Excavation was carried out in site 11.4 to the cob- bled floor of the corridor in order to clarify the northwestern corner of the temple wall, the later, adjacent blocking wall of the corridor around the temple, and the parallel wall in site 11.8. The finds include a coin of Aurelian (270-275). A 2 x 2 m area of site IV.3 was excavated and 14 items were recovered, including coins of Probus (276-282) and Constantine 11(317-340). Excavation was also conducted at site 11.8/11.5 to remove the balks remaining across the north corri- dor of the temple. Some 20 artifacts were recovered, including fragments of Nabataean black-painted bowls, an ostracon, a bronze stamp in excellent con- dition, a sandstone horned altar (showing ashmarks from the incense brazier once upon its top), and coins of Constantine II (317-340) and Constantius 11(324-361). Exposure of the previously unexcavated face of the north wall of the temple revealed a cultic niche cut into the face of the ashlar stones of the wall. The niche had an arched top containing a rectangular piece of marble and a sandstone ledge with an open spout. The marble rectangle, possibly a Dhushares block, was partially destroyed by earthquake fall from adjacent walls. Petra, Weathering of the Roman Theater. Thomas R. Paradise, ACOR USIA Fellow, Univer- sity of Hawaii at Hilo, reports: Research in sandstone deterioration is vital to our understanding of rock structure conservation and earth surface processes. Very little quantitative weathering data, however, are available. Sandstone weathering rates, for instance, are often unobtain- able due to the difficulty in separating the numer- ous complex and interconnected variables. Histor- ical structures of known age, form, and original condition, therefore, have proven to be ideal labo- ratories in which to conduct these studies. At Petra, the hewn sandstone Roman theater was erected during the first century A.D. according to Vitruvian canon. The theater's exposed substrate is comprised of a variable sandstone ranging from a friable, whitish rock to a dense, blackish one. Vari- ables of sandstone lithology (particle size, cement- ing agent, particle shape, and orientation) and topography (aspect, lichen coverage, solar flux, and slope) were statistically correlated with over 500 weathering recess depth measurements. It was discovered that 1) increased solar flux ac- celerated weathering, especially when sandstone matrices contained over 10% calcic oxides; and 2) the matrix-to-particle ratio affected weathering depths. This was due to the irregular thermal ex- pansion of matrix calcite, causing the development of microfractures in the matrix, which accelerated exposure and subsequent weathering through par- ticle disaggregation. Inverse relationships were also found: 1) iron-ox- ide and siliceous constituents in the matrix in- creased as weathering depths decreased; and 2) lichen coverage increased as weathering depths de- creased. It was found that lichen overgrowth indu- rates the sandstone surface through the release of calcium oxalates, which mobilize to develop surface coatings. The discovery that lichens decrease weath- ering through oxalate production rather than in- crease it through rhizinal penetration and substrate dissolution contradicts the results of most previous research. Petra, Southern Temple. Martha Sharp Jou- kowsky, Brown University, reports: The Southern Temple (also known as Bachman's "Great Temple") represents one of the major ar- chaeological and architectural components of Petra. Positioned to the south of the Colonnaded Street and southeast of the Temenos Gate, the Southern Temple occupies a position of paramount impor- tance. From north to south its complex is comprised of a Propylaea, a Sacred Area or Lower Temenos ending in a Grand Stairway, and the Upper Te- menos-the sacred enclosure for the temple proper. Archaeological survey and excavation of the Southern Temple was conducted by Brown Univer- sity in 1993, the first season of a five-year program. The temple stylobate was excavated, and other ar- chitectural components examined, such as the Propylaea and in situ features of the Lower Te- menos. Fieldwork also consisted of reconnaissance, site survey and mapping (including use of a laser Electronic Distance Measuring System for a com- puterized topographic survey of the temple com- plex), and analysis of the ancient landscape and ancient and contemporary drainage problems. Excavations were conducted along the north tem- ple face, with four irregularly sized trenches posi- tioned between fallen column drums in order to ascertain the character of the temple stylobate and its foundations. Within the Upper Temenos, a four- branched subterranean canalization system was un- covered, under the temple courtyard's hexagonal pavement (fig. 17). Constructed with ashlar blocks, it extends more than 5 m to the north, west, and southeast, and in the southwest it takes a dramatic curve and slope downward to what appears to have been a stepped area.</page><page sequence="24">544 GLEN L. PETERMAN [AJA 98 Fig. 17. Petra. The Southern Temple. Hexagonal pavement and opening of the subterranean canalization system (fore- ground); temple stylobate. The temple stylobate measures approximately 28 m (east-west), and we assume the temple itself was ca. 40 m in length, if not more. The bottom course of the crepidoma, or podium, was reached at approxi- mately 1 m below the northwest stylobate edge where a paved floor bedding was uncovered. Our preliminary analysis is that the temple is tetrastyle in antis, with widely spaced central columns at the en- trance (7.9 m), and two end columns located about 5 m to the east and west respectively. A stairway was constructed into the stylobate leading from its level into a broad pronaos, measuring some 8 m in depth. This stairway leads up to the naos, which is approximately 18 x 28 m. From our measurements we estimate that the porch columns (the shaft plus the base and the capital) originally stood ca. 19 m in height. Added to this would have been the super- structure including the pediment and the entabla- ture, hypothetically placing the height of this colossal edifice at 28 m. On the basis of the floral decoration of the lime- stone capitals and the entablature, which is similar to that of the Khasneh, the temple was probably constructed sometime in the early first century A.D. by the Nabataeans, who combined their native tra- ditions with the classical spirit. What is clear is that the temple structure was devastated by the earth- quake of 551, which all but brought the city to ruin and abandonment. Amman, Great Temple. Chrysanthos Kanello- poulos, ACOR, reports: The Roman temple on the Citadel (Jebel el-Qal'a) in Amman is popularly known as the Temple of Hercules. There is no conclusive evidence that it was dedicated to Hercules, but it is securely dated by its dedicatory inscription to the term of the Ro- man governor Geminius Marcianus, i.e., to 161- 166. The temple is on the middle terrace of the Citadel within a colonnaded temenos or courtyard. It is oriented along an east-west axis with its facade to the east. The temple had a hexastyle facade on a podium measuring 43 x 27 m. The height of the columns, including the bases, is 13.5 m. Each col- umn consists of five or six drums, each weighing up to 11 tons. A major objective of the project was to clarify the ground plan of the temple. This fundamental issue has been debated for many decades. We can now show that the temple had six columns at the front and that, while the temple may originally have been intended to have columns all around, it was prob- ably not actually built that way.</page><page sequence="25">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 545 Fig. 18. Amman. The Great Temple. Column capital be- ing restored to its position. Restoration of the temple began in 1992. Most of the material of the temple was already robbed out before the earthquake of 747/48, when the rem- nants of the structure, including the four remaining columns at the front, collapsed. Over the next nine centuries, the building of fortifications on the Cita- del resulted in the reuse of more of its material. It would therefore be impossible to restore the whole monument. Work focused on the only three areas that are restorable: the portico of the temple, the northwest corner of the podium on which the temple rested, and part of the west temenos colonnade. Three col- umns of the temple facade were found to be pre- served and were restored. One section of the inscribed architrave was restored in its original place as determined from the sequence of the in- scription (fig. 18). The fourth shaft from the south, shaft K, was erected in its original position. Its bottom drum, poorly preserved, was replaced by a replica. A rough cylinder with eight bosses or knobs, to ease lifting, was shaped out of a block measuring 1.7 x 1.7 x 3.2 m and weighing 27 tons (fig. 19). The drum, with a diameter of 1.6 m and a height of 2.1 m, was carved from the rectangular block by six stonecutters in 40 days. The project is in the process of being published by ACOR as The Great Temple of Amman: The Architec- ture. Fig. 19. Amman. The Great Temple.

Meier, University of Basel, report: In recent years, archaeologists and art historians have been turning their attention to the develop- ment of urban structures during times of political and cultural transformations. Research has shown that changes in the building patterns of cities lend valuable insight into the impact of such new forces as the Christianization of the Roman Empire in the fourth century or, later, the Islamization of the east- ern Mediterranean. But how was the introduction of new religions made manifest in urban structures? Gerasa serves as an excellent example because much of the ancient city is preserved. From the British-American excavations under- taken in the 1920s, we know that the Christian cult center of Gerasa was situated to the south of the Temple of Artemis. On the upper terrace, archae- ologists first excavated the church of St. Theodore, dated to 494-496 by an inscription. To the east, on a lower level, Crowfoot and his colleagues found a second basilica of enormous size, which is connected to the church by a square atrium with a large, cen- trally placed fountain. Since this so-called "fountain court" forms a structural unit with the lower basil- ica, it must have already been in place by the time the church of St. Theodore was built. The discoverers thought it was a cathedral, and the fountain in the atrium to be that mentioned by Epiphanius, bishop of Salamis ca. 375. If this asso- ciation is accepted, it provides a terminus ante quem for the erection of the lower basilica, suggesting that in the middle of the fourth century the Temple of Artemis would have been flanked by a huge cult center of the new religion. Such an unusual juxta- position of plans may reflect either the peaceful co- existence of old and new faiths or the presence of a Christian majority in Gerasa. There is also a struc- ture under the cathedral. If this was a temple dedi- cated to Dionysos, as Crowfoot asserts, the question then arises whether the Christians were allowed at this early date to demolish a center of the old reli- gions for their own purposes-a situation known, until now, only in Jerusalem. These issues serve as the point of departure for our research. Our first step was to reexamine the fountain as it served both as a hinge between the two churches and as the cult focus for the entire Chris- tian building complex. Our research indicates that the fountain did not originate from the cathedral complex, but was relocated from an earlier first- or second-century site in Gerasa. Evidence also sug- gests the development of the atrium to serve a litur- gical purpose. The structural sequence of the foun- tain court leads to the conclusion that the entire area of the atrium was in use throughout the various building phases of the cathedral complex. The next step for this research project is to analyze the build- ing history of the cathedral. Reused building mate- rials will be catalogued to determine their origin and relationship to the decline of Classical-period buildings nearby. Further excavations will be con- ducted underneath the cathedral floors to explore a square structure, possibly a pagan temple, which is as yet unpublished. Gerasa, Hippodrome. I. Kehrberg and A. Os- trasz, University of Warsaw, report: The excavation of chamber W2 of the hippo- drome in 1993 revealed a compact layer of misfired pottery dating to the second half of the sixth century A.D. Hundreds of unfired pottery and lamp frag- ments were also found mixed with the misfired sherds. The fragments vary in size and represent several types of pottery, the most important of which are the so-called 'Jerash Bowls." Various forms of rims and bases, as well as plain and decorated body- sherds (white- and red-painted, and with stamped decoration), are present. The lamp fragments are of the sixth-century Jerash lamp type with zoomorphic handles. All unfired fragments are of the same tem- pered clay and are in date and typological range identical with the misfired pottery. It is now irrefutable that Jerash Bowls were made in Gerasa. The hippodrome has so far emerged as the only center of ceramic production of the sixth century that has provided ample evidence for all possible kinds of discarded waste products-mal- formed and misfired fragments and, most sig- nificant of all, the unfired Jerash Bowls. The other interesting aspect of the unfired lot is that typical mid-to-late sixth-century pottery and lamps were made of the same ware, at one potter's workshop. Based on this and other evidence, we suggest that the various pottery types and lamps were planned for one firing. During the course of excavation in chamber W2 in 1992, human skeletal remains of at least eight individuals were found under and between tum- bled stones of the vault of the chamber. Additional skeletal remains have been found, bringing the number of individuals to perhaps more than 40. The position of the remains and the number of bod- ies in the chamber attest to mass burial rather than a number of individuals being instantly killed by a collapse of the vault. The corpses appear to have been dumped in the chamber (on top of the ceramic dump) with no regard to any burial custom. One</page><page sequence="27">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 547 Fig. 20. Gadara. Western gate area. (Photo M. Jung) can assume that this was done in a hurry. The corpses were hardly covered with any soil. This manner of disposal is common in times of plague. A gold tremissis of either Constans II (641-668) or Constantine IV (668-685) was found among the badly crushed bones of one of the bodies. No later deposits were found between the surface of the dump and the bottom of the stones of the broken vault. The coin fixes the terminus post quem for both the burial and the earthquake, which caused the collapse of the vaulted chamber. The attribution of the coin to Constans II being more probable, it is likely that it was the earthquake of 659/60. The plague and its aftermath clearly preceded the earth- quake. One may argue, however, for a close date of the two calamities, since the crushed bones were virtually glued to some stones. Such a phenomenon is likely to have occurred while the bones were still enveloped in flesh rather than long after the flesh disintegrated and the bones dried. Excavation of the neighboring chamber W3 indicates that the situ- ation is the same as in chamber W2. Remains of about 10 bodies have been revealed so far. Gadara/Umm Qeis. A. Hoffman, Deutsches Ar- chdiologisches Institut, Berlin, reports: Research at Gadara in 1993 focused on two areas and problems: the hippodrome and the city for- tifications. The historical development of the west- ern city gate complex may now be reconstructed. The road connecting the "Tiberias Gate" to the Jor- dan Valley (fig. 20) was paved outside the city in the second half of the first century A.D. At the same time-or perhaps slightly earlier-a necropolis with freestanding columns was built on both sides of the street. Most of the richly decorated mausolea were torn down during the late third century when the western gate and associated city wall were erected. Part of the street pavement was removed and the gate was erected with reused material from the de- molished mausolea. The city wall-except the foun- dations-was constructed of newly cut limestone ashlars. The historical events causing the erection of these fortifications are unknown, but the fortifications are contemporary with those of Gerasa of the late third century. By this time the expansion of Gadara to the west had been curtailed. The colonnaded street probably had not yet reached this point, and there is evidence that the area inside the wall was not densely settled. The growth of Imperial Gadara had reached its end. After the disastrous earthquakes of the eighth century, the gate was not rebuilt, but the area to the northwest was still in use until Mamluk, or perhaps even Ottoman, times. The hypothesis that the hippodrome remained unfinished was strengthened by excavations in 1992. There is evidence that carceres had been planned at its eastern end but neither these nor a sphendone at the opposite end, or a counter tribune at the southern side of the hippodrome, were built. No foundations existed in these areas. The presence of three tombs at the western end of the hippo- drome suggests that it was abandoned in the fifth century.</page><page sequence="28">548 GLEN L. PETERMAN [AJA 98 New excavations at the southern side of the acropolis were opened to obtain information on the largely unknown Hellenistic occupation at Gadara. Some details are given by literary sources (predomi- nantly Josephus) but no architectural remains had been identified with certainty. In 1992, at the south- western corner of the hill, part of a strong city wall of well-dressed limestone blocks was excavated. The ceramics recovered indicate that it was constructed in the first half of the second century B.C., and de- stroyed about a century later. These dates may be linked with events recorded by Josephus. The con- struction of part of the city wall was perhaps initi- ated after the conquest ofAntiochos III as one of the first measures by the new Seleucid power. Its de- struction was probably caused by the Hasmonean Alexander Jannaeus when he conquered the north- western territories of Transjordan during the first two decades of the first century A.D. A roughly pentagonal-shaped tower of the city wall was also partly excavated. It is constructed of limestone ashlar masonry in a header-and-stretcher technique and is preserved with 12 courses up nearly 7 m high. There is evidence that this tower was part of a city gate. New information came from the southeastern corner of the city wall where a 14 x 10 m tower, reported by Schumacher in 1886, was excavated. It was constructed of limestone in a vari- ant of the header-and-stretcher technique and is preserved to 5 m high. Its eastern face was strength- ened by a strong rectangular bastion (possibly served by a ramp), which, in combination with the tower itself, may have served as an artillery plat- form. The towers belong to the Hellenistic period. Humeima. John P Oleson, University of Victoria, Khairieh 'Amr, DAJ, Rebecca Foote, and Robert Schick report: In 1993, the presence of yet a third Byzantine church at Humeima was documented. The new church apparently had a marble chancel screen, al- though only a few small fragments have survived. The walls found at the east end of the B 100 complex may have belonged to ancillary rooms behind the apse, like those attached to both the other Byzantine churches at the site. These walls are Byzantine in date but extend deep into Nabataean levels. A burial found below the central apse presents some interesting problems. It is probably Middle Nabataean in date and should not be associated with the church itself, but it is puzzling to find a burial in the center of the habitation area, near the public cisterns. It is possible that the area around B 100 was a Nabataean sanctuary or temple area that attracted Fig. 21. Humeima. East gate of Roman fort, with thresh- old. (Photo C. Mundigler) burials. Numerous fragments of Nabataean archi- tectural elements found reused in the later B 100 structures may derive from a Nabataean temple on the site. The Byzantine church might then have been located there to take advantage of its sanctity. There was reuse of the church in the Early Islamic period, and ultimately a warren of rooms was built within it. The function of this later complex remains uncertain, although the presence of numerous small rooms and of tabuns suggests habitation. Excavation in the Lower Church (C 101) provided further information about the entrance room (room 4), and of the large number of rooms attached to the west and south walls of the church. This ancillary complex was probably very extensive. Excavations around the Upper Church (C 119) revealed a single apse framed by two small side rooms. Excavation in one of these rooms revealed fragments of a large number of liturgical glass oil lamps. Painted plaster decorated the walls of the nave, which had a door in either side wall and several peripheral rooms. Excavation in the Roman fort (E116) provided the information that it was probably constructed in the late second century, possibly as late as the early third. No fort of this period has previously been carefully excavated in Jordan. Probes and excava- tion revealed that a square tower projected from each corner of the fort, and a pair of towers framed each of the four gates (fig. 21). Intermediate towers projected from the curtain wall. The overall plan of the fort and many of its component parts were laid out in even multiples of the Roman foot. The pres- ence of many first-century A.D. sherds within the walls suggests that there may have been a small Nabataean fort in the area, or perhaps a favored camping area, near the reservoir fed by the aque- duct.</page><page sequence="29">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 549 In field F102, excavation revealed this year that the Early Islamic domestic complex is larger than anticipated. The complex can now be seen to have been built in association with the adjacent cistern, which is now attributed to Nabataean origins. In F103, the Abbasid qasr excavation of the frescoed room found in 1992 provided extensive remains of an early Abbasid fresco with floral motifs and the remains of ivory furniture panels decorated with a figured scene. The discovery that a small building just outside the main structure is a mosque clinches identification of the F103 structure as the home of the Abbasid family mentioned in contem- porary literary sources. The continued surveying and sampling of the tombs carried out in 1993 provided further infor- mation concerning burial practices in the Early and Middle Nabataean and the Byzantine periods. The first Nabataean inscriptions found at Humeima (other than petroglyphs) also came from one tomb, along with a fragment of a Greek inscription. El-Haditha. S. Thomas Parker, North Carolina State University, reports: In 1976 a cemetery was discovered at el-Haditha on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. Many graves had been illicitly robbed, but several intact graves were excavated by the DAJ. One grave contained an adult human skeleton, two imported fineware ce- ramic vessels, and an iron helmet. The grave contained two African Red Slip bowls. Vessel 42 is a shallow bowl of fine redware decorated with a glossy red slip (Hayes Form 59B). The stamped decoration consists of geometric and floral designs. Vessel 41 is also a shallow bowl of fine red- ware with a glossy red slip; it is decorated with a complex stamped design of palm leaves and con- centric circles. This vessel is identified as Hayes Form 61A. Both vessels are clearly imports and date to ca. 350-420 on the basis of the decoration (Hayes Type A ii). The grave itself and the associated iron helmet also probably date to the same period. Very little Roman military equipment has been published fromJordan and no Roman helmets have previously been published from any Jordanian sites. Thus, the Haditha helmet is important not only for its uniqueness in this region but also because it can be closely dated to within a century by the associated pottery. The helmet (fig. 22) consists of a bowl formed by two iron pieces joined together by a wide iron strip. Iron rivets near the edge both on one side and on the rear suggest that the helmet once included cheekpieces and a neckguard. There is no evidence Fig. 22. El-Haditha. Iron helmet found in a Roman sol- dier's burial. of a crest. The helmet from Haditha falls within the fourth-fifth century "Ridge Type" attested from Ro- man military sites along the northern frontier. The presence of two imported fine tableware ves- sels in the burial suggests that the inhumed person was of high status and the helmet further suggests that the individual was a soldier. How did this sol- dier happen to be buried at el-Haditha? Fortunately, the only complete list of Roman military units, the Notitia Dignitatum, dates to this period (i.e., ca. 400). Several Roman units are attested in the region of the Dead Sea. Perhaps our soldier was a discharged veteran from one of these units, who chose to spend his retirement in the Ghor. BYZANTINE AND ISLAMIC The Petra Church Project. Zbigniew T. Fiema, ACOR, Khairieh 'Amr, DAJ, and Robert Schick, ACOR, report: Between May 1992 and March 1993 excavations were conducted at a Byzantine church in Petra, un- der the overall direction of Pierre M. Bikai, with Zbigniew T Fiema, Robert Schick, and Khairieh 'Amr codirecting the work in the field. The building is a standard triple-apsed basilica with the nave di- vided from the aisles by two rows of eight columns. The nave ends in an elevated bema and a larger semicircular apse. The church building proper is about 25 m long and 16 m wide. An atrium is to the west of the church. Three doors lead into the church from the atrium to the west. Two doors in the north wall of the church, and a third door in the northeast corner of the atrium, lead to a series of rooms adjoining the church on the north. The north and south aisles are paved with mosa- ics, while the nave, bema, and central apse are paved with an opus sectile pavement of marble and purple</page><page sequence="30">550 GLEN L. PETERMAN [AJA 98 Fig. 23. Petra. Byzantine church, south aisle, mosaic de- picting Oceanos. sandstone. The mosaic in the north aisle, measuring 22.6 x 3 m, consists of rows of circular medallions formed by vine scrolls. Each of the 28 horizontal rows contains three medallions. The central vertical row of medallions depicts objects such as amphorae, vases, goblets, candlesticks, and baskets. The verti- cal rows on either side contain flanking pairs of birds, other animals, and people. At the western end two peacocks flank an amphora from which the vine scrolls emanate. The background outside the me- dallions is yellow, while white marble cubes are used as background within the medallions. Glass cubes are liberally used in the floor, especially for details of faces. The south aisle, measuring 23.2 x 3.3 m, has a central row of rectangular medallions, some of which are identified by short Greek inscriptions as personifications of the Seasons, Ocean (fig. 23), Land, and Wisdom. Flanking the central row are square and circular medallions depicting fish, birds, and animals. Many glass tesserae are used in this aisle, as well as red-fired ceramic tesserae. The two side apses are also paved with mosaics, in a simple yellow and white checkerboard pattern. The walls of the church are also decorated with mosaics. While thousands of loose stone and glass cubes were recovered, many intact sections were also found. Parts of the border design and portions of human faces can be ascertained. Although no dedicatory inscriptions were found, and the coins and ceramics provide only very gen- eral dating for the history of the church, it appears that the church may have been constructed in the later fifth century, and continued as a church throughout the first half of the sixth century. The structural collapse may have been due to an earth- quake, perhaps the one in 551, although later earth- quakes cannot be excluded. Fire and robbing activities preceded the collapse of the church walls and columns; squatter occupation continued into the early seventh century. In December 1993, in a room just north of the northern apse, two groups of carbonized but legible papyrus scrolls were uncovered. Deir 'Ain Abata, Ghor es-Safi. Konstantinos Poli- tis, British Museum, reports: During the fourth season of excavations at Deir 'Ain Abata in 1992, we completed work in the basili- can church (fig. 24), opened two new areas, and updated all plans, drawings, and photographs. The overall objective was to end the field project and begin the final report on the site. In the depressed area of the chancel a number of collapsed pieces of mosaic floor were lifted. The cause of this depression was a deep cistern that was apparently fed by a water channel coming from the direction of the cave. In the cave associated with the church, the Byzan- tine floor was completely unearthed, revealing two flights of steps leading into a simple rectangular room with plaster sides and white marble-slab floor- ing. There was no evidence that it was either a tomb or storeroom. At the northern edge of the cave a sondage was made below the Byzantine level, pro- ducing Roman pottery. Below this at a depth of about 2 m was found a wall and pebble-floor surface with several complete pots belonging to the late EB I period. The northern wall of the basilican church was also fully exposed for the first time, revealing a blocked entrance. This led into the refectory and kitchen area, which was the main focus of excavations dur-</page><page sequence="31">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 551 Fig. 24. Deir 'Ain Abata. Reconstruction drawing of the basilica. (J.M. Farrant) ing this season. Here, a number of rooms were re- lated to domestic activities. The central feature was the dining area, along with a large oven, a millstone, a tabun, a water channel, two possibly ceremonial basins, and an apparently blocked passageway into the cave. Under the dining room floor a communal burial chamber was discovered containing over a dozen skeletons. It was not excavated. The final area of excavation was in one of the 20 cairn tombs just north of the main site. It was built with a rectangular platform around it measuring 5 x 10 m. Eleven MB II pots were found along with a copper fibula fragment and many roughly cut shell and stone beads. Of particular interest were five lunate microliths also found in the tomb. Extensive conservation work was done on the mo- saic floors as well as consolidation of many walls. A permanent exhibition was set up in the Kerak Mu- seum with selected finds. Finally, a proposal was accepted by the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Jordan to restore and develop Deir 'Ain Abata as a touristic site. The work began in 1993 with continued conservation of the mosaics and structures. Pathways and a road were constructed leading up to the site. The local spring was cleaned and a house was built that will eventu- ally become part of the greater development proj- ect. It was also decided to continue archaeological excavations during the course of the touristic devel- opment. Amman, Church of St. George. Pierre M. Bikai, ACOR, reports: Located on Jabal al-Waybdeh, which was part of ancient Ammon-Philadelphia, the site rises in two rounded platforms from the hill, the uppermost penetrated by at least five caves, three of which have remnants of mosaic floors. Three of the caves are incorporated into a structure built during the 1920s</page><page sequence="32">552 GLEN L. PETERMAN [AJA 98 Fig. 25. Amman. The Church of St. George. (Photo B. Steri) or 1930s. Today the house serves as a center for art, "Darat al-Funun" of the Shoman Foundation. The largest cave is the lowest one on the cliff and its entrance faces south, toward the lower terrace that forms a flat platform for the remains of a church. The structure was first noted by Conder in his Survey of Eastern Palestine (1881). Most of the re- mains Conder mentioned still exist. In 1905, Savignac and Abel visited the site and reported a votive inscription mentioning Hercules. Another dedicatory inscription was published by Abel in 1908; two important names are mentioned, that of the priest of St. George who built the church and a Polyiuctus who was bishop of Philadelphia. The new excavations at the site were directed by Bikai. The presence of modern rubbish throughout all levels of most trenches excavated shows that the site is thoroughly disturbed. The Church of St. George, preliminarily dated to the sixth century, was built largely on bedrock. It is 15 m wide and 24.5 m long and oriented nearly east/west (fig. 25). There is one entrance to the west and possibly a second entrance to the south. The cave adjoining the northern aisle may have been the focus of the cult and the fact that the cave was to the north may have led to a modified cruciform plan. There are three columns on each side dividing the nave from the aisle and the interaxial spacing between these columns indicates that the structure had both a north/south orientation and an east/west orienta- tion. The two pairs of columns to the west and their corresponding pilasters on the western wall have an interaxial spacing of some 4 m while the space be- tween the easternmost pair is 7 m. This wide area would have joined the proposed entrance to the south and the cave to the north. The area of the northern aisle, in front of the cave, is paved with white tesserae with a few colored insets, including a cross. In the western part of the northern aisle there is a plaster-lined pit, perhaps used as a baptistry. Adjacent to this are the remnants of a multicolored mosaic. Other patches of mosaic are preserved in other areas including the atrium, which had at least four columns, perhaps support- ing a porch. In the bema to the east, remnants of an opus sectile pavement are preserved. There were a number of small finds including three stones with figures of animals and Safaitic inscriptions on them. Umm el-Jimal. Bert de Vries, Calvin College, re- ports: Fieldwork at Umm el-Jimal in 1993 included a stratigraphic study of house 119. This domestic complex was studied because it is located at the modern entrance to Umm el-Jimal across the lane from the barracks, and is ideally situated for adap- tation as a site museum and visitor center. The house consists of a large open courtyard, an entry gate, seven small ground-floor rooms, and two larger rooms (st;.bles A and B) south of the court- yard (fig. 26). Both stables are partitioned by walls containing a doorway and a row of mangers. These mangers were suitable for large domestic animals and could be used from both sides. Stable A is pre- served with the manger wall intact to the ceiling and some ceiling corbels still in place. The earliest occupation was Byzantine, evident only in room C. In the rest of the probes, Umayyad and later materials were present. Whereas the walls</page><page sequence="33">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 553 \5 0 2 4 6 8 10 ?r'" 12.90 672 courtyard 11 Stable A Stable B t l Stable A entry 5 L6 .mdon animal pen U Fig. 26. Umm el-Jimal. Plan of house 119. (D. Winnail) of room C are associated with the Byzantine floor, the walls of stable A and its mangers appear to have been constructed in the Umayyad period. Strati- graphic evidence also indicates that the Umayyad building may not have been completed when it col- lapsed (presumably in the earthquake of 747/8). On the south side of the house is a large mound comprised of ash layers containing Byzantine pot- tery, but all layers were deposited in the Umayyad period. We suggest that the Umayyad builders thor- oughly cleaned the Byzantine site prior to construc- tion and reconstruction. Only the extremely hard floor in room C was left in place. (This is a pattern we found previously, where cobble-based plaster floors were installed below the level of earlier Byzan- tine floors.) Occupation of the courtyard and house contin- ued in the Abbasid period, even after the partial collapse of the house. Stable A was not used, prob- ably because of the severe state of collapse. The final phases of occupation were in the 20th century. In the Late Ottoman period, ca. 1930, an effort was made to restore stable A for occupation. A new par- tition was partially constructed between the man- gers and the north wall of the stable, and the doorway of the stable was also reconstructed. We believe that the Druze, who had been living at Umm el-Jimal since ca. 1910, were in the process of re- modeling house 119 when they left the site for Azraq and Amman. Studies of the pathology of a larger population group from the Late Byzantine period excavation may be very important in the light of the findings at house 119. The Umayyad builders' deliberate re- moval and burning of the Byzantine occupation ma- terials is unusual, and one wonders if this may be related to the prevalence of plagues in the late sixth century. Study of a large sample of Late Byzantine skeletons could supply the medical evidence needed to test this hypothesis. Nakhal. Robert Schick, and Hamzeh Mahasneh and Sultan Ma'ani, Mu'ta University, report:</page><page sequence="34">554 GLEN L. PETERMAN [AJA 98 The first season of excavations at Nakhal, a large multiperiod village site in the southern Karak pla- teau, was conducted in 1993. Excavation began in the core northeast quarter of the site in a large Byz- antine-Early Islamic building (area A), and a Byzan- tine church/Late Islamic house (area B). The area A structure is approximately 18 x 18 m, constructed with exceptionally large building stones. About a quarter of the building was exca- vated. In the north center of the building (A. 1) were two partially intact flagstone pavements above a plaster floor. Nothing indicates clearly the function of the building. The flagstone pavements and a sec- ondary north-south wall represent rebuilding dur- ing the Byzantine and Early Islamic periods of the building, which may be Nabataean in origin. Byzan- tine pottery was recovered from the foundation trench for the wall cut through the plaster floor. A short Arabic inscription on the north wall, from the first century A.D., provides a date for some of the rebuilding. The nature of the pre-church building in area B remains unclarified. The church, almost all of which was excavated, was a triple-apsed basilica with a flagstone pavement. Two doorways are in the north wall. Another door is in the south wall; to its south is a corridor with a flagstone pavement. The struc- ture was extensively rebuilt in the Late Islamic pe- riod when new walls subdivided the building into smaller rooms. In the process most features of the church were removed, including much of the flag- stone pavement and the two rows of arch piers. The west half of the building (B.1) was a courtyard in the Late Islamic house. Late Islamic rooms were built around the apses. In the central apse (B.2), the church pavement was replaced by an irregular flag- stone pavement. In the north apse (B.3), a Late Is- lamic floor was laid directly above bedrock. In the south apse (B.5), the church flagstone pavement with a platform was raised one step in the apse. The apse was built of soft limestone blocks, unlike the hard limestone elsewhere. That, and its placement off the line of the other two apses, suggest that it is not the original apse. Khirbet Salameh. Pierre M. Bikai, ACOR, re- ports: Khirbet Salameh is located in Amman opposite the University of Jordan and across the street from ACOR. Excavation at the site is a summer class in field archaeology for University of Jordan students and is a joint project of the University and ACOR. There appear to be at least four phases of use of the area: 1) In one small area, the walls of a large building are laid over an earlier structure that is oriented differently; preliminary readings of the ceramics in- dicate that the earlier building dates to Iron Age II. 2) The second phase of the building may have been Hellenistic. There is a quantity of early Helle- nistic material including ceramics and two Ptole- maic coins. 3) The third phase, to which most of the remains appear to belong, may be Late Roman/Byzantine. In this phase, roughly cut stones are used but the construction appears to incorporate elements from the Hellenistic phase and may also incorporate ele- ments of an Iron Age structure. The Roman/Byzan- tine building is square, 23.5 m on each side. The exterior as well as the interior walls are large, ca. 1.2 m in width. The interior of the structure contains a number of rectangular rooms around a courtyard. Four doors opening from those rooms into the courtyard were found, each with sills and parts of doorjambs. 4) In association with the deposition over the square structure there were remains of broken walls, possibly of the Umayyad period. At the upper- most level, a number ofAyyubid sherds were found. Thus we have a structure on the fringes of ancient Amman that appears to have been built, aban- doned, and rebuilt again over a period of at least a millennium. The importance of the site is that the incorporation of different stages in the construction may shed light on the history of and the reasons for expansion in particular periods, and abandonment in other periods. Khirbet Salameh seems to be simi- lar in its historical process to the hundreds of sites scattered outside the large fortified settlements such as Amman. Interpretations of these sites differ, but most scholars now agree that in general these sites were agricultural settlements. Madaba, Archaeological Park. Branwen Denton, ACOR, reports: In 1991, a major archaeological project was initi- ated by the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, ACOR, and USAID to create an archaeological park in the heart of downtown Madaba, incorporating a well-preserved stretch of Late Roman street and ad- jacent buildings dating to the Roman through Umayyad periods. Excavations are being conducted within the precinct of the park at the same time that shelters are being erected over in situ mosaic pave- ments. The goals of the park project are to explore the history of Madaba, to protect its archaeological heritage from destruction, and to revitalize down- town Madaba's touristic character. The exposed section of the Roman road runs east-west and is bisected by a modern street running north-south. The street is paved with large flag- stones and was originally flanked by columns, frag-</page><page sequence="35">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 555 N;1o 0 ilo 0 _._ _ _ -1- .. .........  ----' - - T i - I s.s.s3 CISTERN .... . . . .. ii 11 6 14ii 1320----- j4 ..... --------- II i i 4 223 ii 2 ..i...I-.......Z i ! ; :..._j ii I I.--..-- I~~~~~~" ij..

Ex- cavation of the Church of the Prophet Elijah and Crypt of Saint Elianos, on the south side of the street, was directed by Cherie Lenzen. The excava- tion in the church uncovered mosaics beneath struc- tures dating to the Late Ottoman/Early Modern period, including part of a previously excavated medallion inscription; the mosaics are being con- served and will be protected by a shelter. The ceiling of the crypt of Saint Elianos, beneath the presbytery of the church, was consolidated so that excavations in this area could be completed. An archaeological survey of the urban core of an- cient Madaba was also carried out, under the direc- tion of Timothy Harrison (supra). Branwen Denton and Beatrice St. Laurent are conducting a survey of Madaba's vernacular architecture. Buildings dating to the late 19th and early 20th centuries have been identified, photographed, and recorded. The most architecturally significant structures are being stud- ied in more depth, to be published together with a history of Madaba. ACOR is also collecting material relevant to Madaba's history to be housed in an ar- chive to be available for scholarly research. Madaba, "Burnt Palace." Ghazi Bisheh, ACOR, reports: The "Burnt Palace," one of the few non-ecclesias- tical structures excavated in Madaba, is located on the north side of the western segment of the ex- posed Roman street. In 1985, Michele Piccirillo ex- cavated a large tessellated room in the eastern section of the complex and called it the "Burnt Pal- ace" because of the extensive ashy debris covering the floor. This room has proven to be part of a larger building that extends to the west and was initially constructed in the early seventh century. Current excavations are focusing on the areas north and west of the last 20-m stretch of the Roman street. Although the full extent of the complex could not be determined, it is clear that the three exposed units formed a single construction project and adhered to a coherent plan (fig. 27). The focus of this plan was a flagstone-paved courtyard (5) with a portico on the eastern side (6). The complex was entered via three doorways to the south. The westernmost of these entrances appears to have been the main one and led into the central courtyard (4). The middle one was fronted by a</page><page sequence="36">556 GLEN L. PETERMAN [AJA 98 pavement of plain white tesserae and led to the east portico (3), while the third provided access to the stone-paved forecourt of the eastern wing (2). Of the northern architectural unit only a long rectangular corridor has been fully excavated (7). Its floor was of colored mosaics set in a variety of geometric patterns. The pavement was damaged, apparently by an earth tremor, in the early seventh century and was patched with large, irregularly shaped stones-perhaps an indication of reduced civic wealth. To the north of the corridor three parallel rooms were partially exposed. The easternmost (8) was paved with colored mosaics. They include a par- tially intact Season in an acanthus scroll, and a bust of Tyche located in front of the threshold that led into the corridor. In the ash overlying the corridor's floor two bronze disks with lions' heads cast in re- pouss6, a bronze lamp, a large bronze basin, and a large quantity of iron nails were found. Room 9 was also paved with mosaics in a scale pattern enclosed by a plaited border. The central courtyard was bounded on the west by a long room (11) divided into five bays by four transverse arches that sprang from attached piers. The floor was paved with nearly complete mosaics. Two main square panels, one with a geometric de- sign and the other with a white field sprinkled with tassels, are separated by a rectangular strip of white tesserae on which is depicted a lion attacking a bull. The square room (12) is divided into three bays by two transverse arches springing from attached piers. Its nearly completely preserved mosaic floor consists of a field decorated with a pattern of in- dented squares, bordered by a guilloche. A small stone-paved court (17) is to the south. The precise archaeological history of the complex is obscured by the construction of recent buildings, but the complex shows evidence of destruction shortly after it was built, for example, the repair of mosaic floors and standing walls. The second de- struction was more extensive as evidenced by the ash layer in many parts of the complex. In general, the Umayyad ceramic tradition dominates in de- struction deposits. This indicates that the second destruction may be attributed to the well-docu- mented earthquake of747/8. A few unstratified pot- sherds and a complete lamp (dating to the second half of the eighth or early ninth century) indicate that feeble attempts were made to reoccupy the al- most completely destroyed building. The results of the excavations so far have demon- strated the richness of the material representing the Late Byzantine and Early Islamic periods. Far from being economically impoverished and socially cha- otic, these periods witnessed remarkable growth that dramatically altered the areas adjacent to the Roman street. Madaba, Sunna' Church and Bajjaly Area. Michele Piccirillo, Studium Biblicum Franciscanum, reports: As part of the Madaba Archaeological Park Proj- ect, the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum carried out archaeological excavations in the area of the Church of the Virgin in the eastern sector of the park. The excavations have brought to light a further sector of the Roman road along the north wall of the Sunna' Church. Probes inside and outside this church have proven that this sacred Christian edifice was built in the sixth century. The church had no direct connection to the preexisting Roman road, although it followed the main orientation of the road like the three other churches built in the area (the Church of the Virgin Mary, the Church of the Prophet Elias, and the Church of al-Khadir). It seems that the road was covered by a layer of beaten earth throughout the Byzantine-Umayyad period. The church was built above a thick layer dating to the second-third centuries A.D. without traces of buildings. The basilica has three aisles, with a central apse and synthronon, and, unlike the other churches of Madaba, has no trace of reused materials. It was paved with mosaics of a fine quality. Only the mosaic floor of the southern aisle and main portions in the nave have survived. A continuous border of juxta- posed circles was decorated in the corners with the personifications of the Rivers of Paradise. The inner carpet was divided into three main panels. The western one was decorated with hunting scenes in a vineyard. The so-called Bajjaly Area on the northeastern side of the Church of the Virgin Mary comprises an urban sector on the northern edge of the city, where four main periods of occupation were represented: Late Ottoman, post-Byzantine, Byzantine-Umay- yad, and Roman. The Late Ottoman period consists of a large hous- ing complex with five rooms arranged around a courtyard. Dating to the post-Byzantine period is an edifice built over a Byzantine room paved with mo- saics, with reused huge ashlar stones taken from the podium of the Roman temple on which the Church of the Virgin was built. The building can tentatively be dated to the Mamluk period. During the Byzantine-Umayyad period, the area was intensively settled with two main complexes situated around two courtyards. The house on the northeast sector with a central courtyard paved with</page><page sequence="37">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 557 TELL AL-HUSN PLAN OFSUMMIT L'N SStallsF: S n ;?20ON - - LEGEND , ," = Byzantine Walls rn Later Additions Undated Wall lines " j --Edge of Excavated Area 2m CO.

Some of the rooms of a house in the southwestern sector had painted walls, as colored plaster fragments were found mixed with sherds of the Byzantine-Umayyad pe- riod. Foundations from the Roman period, prob- ably of domestic structures, have been identified in the central sector of the area. Pella Excavations. Pamela Watson, BIAAH, and John Tidmarsh, University of Sydney, report: The main urban settlement at Pella is composed of two tells, of which the northern tell (the main city mound of Khirbet Fahl) has been extensively inves- tigated since the joint University of Sydney-College of Wooster Project began in 1979. In the winter 1993 season, the unexcavated surface wall lines on the summit were fully planned, and further work on the sixth-seventh century Byzantine complex ex- posed the plan of the structure and investigated its earlier phases (fig. 28). The building consists of two main sections: 1) An earlier building in the southeastern quarter of the complex, which had been extensively re- paired and reorganized in rather rough masonry, in the fourth-fifth centuries A.D. A number of walls or base courses of finer construction apparently be- long to an original Roman building. 2) In the sixth century, this building was rein- forced by a buttress against the north wall, and a large complex was added to the northeast. This was well constructed, with a lower story of stone and an upper story of mudbrick. Six standardized rooms open onto an L-shaped courtyard, as does a seventh room from the old building. Each of the six rooms is subdivided by a bench partitioned into compart- ments by upright orthostats, a well-known feature commonly interpreted as mangers for stables, both at Pella and in the Hauran. They have also been interpreted as "window walls" in the Galilee, but this would make little sense in these enclosed two-story buildings on Husn. Two other such rooms opening onto a wide corridor, and thence to a laneway, were attached to the eastern side of the complex. Consideration of layout, associations, and site suggests the Late Byzantine complex may have housed a small mounted garrison with a mili- tary/policing function. A final phase of use (prob- ably post-Islamic conquest) before its destruction in the mid-seventh century (the earthquake of 659?) is clearly domestic, when it was no longer performing its original function. The Roman presence in the southern soundings consists of sections of fine ashlar construction, in- cluding a deep terrace wall associated with a stone pavement and columned stylobate (mostly robbed in antiquity), perhaps part of a temenos or propy- laeum for a major Classical sanctuary thought to be on Husn (as depicted on the city-coin minted at</page><page sequence="38">558 GLEN L.

The EBA architecture appearing on the edges of the tell comprises massive rubble-built structures- a platform and a wall-and a storage/industrial area with bins, passageway, and bench. Aqaba/'Ayla. Donald Whitcomb, ACOR and Uni- versity of Chicago, reports: Two phases of work were undertaken at the Early Islamic city of 'Ayla in 1992: the clearance of an entire street and the clearance of the city wall above the beach. Both phases have resulted in a clearer impression of the city ruins for the visitor, while pro- viding dramatic new information on the archae- ological history of 'Ayla. The Egyptian Street takes its name from the Egyptian Gate, that is, the northwestern gate of 'Ayla (fig. 29), and was a main thoroughfare con- necting the gate with the Central Pavilion. The Egyptian Gate and the inner arch were architectural elements of the original town plan, and probably formed a vestibule. This space was reorganized as part of the street in the eighth century. Beyond the inner arch, the excavations revealed buildings fronting the street. The general character of these structures suggests residential units of the late Ab- basid or Fatimid periods. Several side streets were partially excavated to facilitate movements of visi- tors. It is now possible to walk down the late Abbasid street and to visualize something of the character of this Islamic city. The city wall fronting the beach was revealed along its entire southwest face. In the course of this work a tower (tower 12) was excavated, and more importantly, the southwest corner tower (tower 22)</page><page sequence="39">1994] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 559 was also excavated. We now know that the external shape of this tower is clearly Early Islamic and not Roman as some have suggested. The excavation of half the tower revealed its internal configuration. The original doorway was a diagonal passage into the city, a crawlway less than 1 m in height. Next to this doorway was an engaged column, part of the original building, preserved to its capital. This cor- ner tower, the flanking walls, and towers toward the north (tower 23) and east now provide a dramatic view of the site from the beach and the park walk- way along the beach. When the trees are removed and minimal reconstruction has been done, the tourist site will be integrated with the city park and public beach. As an unexpected bonus for this season the Ab- basid suq was discovered during the last days of ex- cavation. We had noted that tower 21 had been re- built as a square structure. This conversion precisely parallels the history of the Square Tower (tower 19) excavated in 1989. The explanation for this was provided by the discovery of walls continuing from the corner tower to tower 21. This wall was pierced by a series of doorways, six of which have now been uncovered. We can now project a continuous series of small shops built along the beach and probably flanking both sides of the Sea Gate. In the Abbasid period the city wall no longer functioned as such but became the backdrop for one of the main commer- cial centers of the Islamic city. AMERICAN CENTER OF ORIENTAL RESEARCH P.o.
