Or, to put it more positively, Renaissance Studies in the second year of the twenty-first cen- tury has moved toward its historically central topics: New World discovery, the Reformation, bibliography, classical influence. The study of these topics, however, is now imbued with a very sophis- ticated mastery of the work done in the last two theoretical de- cades of the twentieth century. The study of subjectivity is no longer so purely a psychoanalytic project; it is also revisiting re- ligious discourse and the spiritual practices endemic to the Ref- ormation. At the same time, however, study of the classics and of New World discoveries is most usefully inflected with an under- standing of psychoanalysis. Bibliography as the "histoire des livres," or study of the "material book," is distinctly the most vital of the more traditional topoi. Clearly the revolution in editing practices that seeks to render as fully as possible the book as a historical object has revivified the study of the material book- taking perhaps even greater force now from the accessibility granted by the Early English Books Online database. Now com- pletely embedded in the most detailed and thickest of cultural descriptions, study of the book as physical object has produced a number of weighty volumes packed with information. It has even captured the interest of historians-two books in an established Maureen Quilligan, R. Florence Brinkley Professor of English and chair of the department at Duke University, is the author of three books and editor of several collections of essays on Renaissance literature. She is working on three book projects, two of them treating female authority in the Renais- sance and one a study of the discourse of slavery in the English Renaissance epic. She has recently served as guest editor for a special issue of the Jour- nal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies, "Renaissance Materialities."</page><page sequence="2">234 Recent Studies history series from a British publisher take the material book as their focus. Perhaps the most traditional of Renaissance topics is the legacy of the classics, and this too is well represented with a number of studies-and here, especially in the case of Ovid, psy- choanalytic theories have enabled new readings and connections. Some of the new issues that were first opened by late-twenti- eth-century criticism, such as the place of women's writing in Renaissance culture, carry on with renewed force. While only one new edition of women's writing appeared this year, a generous number of studies digest what has already been published. The remapping of political influence around the globe is the focus of a number of books. And the importance of material bookmaking has had its effect on the study of global connections-specifi- cally, on a fairly large group of books directly devoted to map making. The New World, however, has found its place within the Old, the New World having been first considered by Columbus to be the Old World. Such globalization of Renaissance studies means that we need to take into account Islam and India as well as America; this new-old fold in the history of the European em- pires is also now represented by a number of compelling mono- graphs. Allied to this field is a continuing concern for national identity-a number of studies concern the construction of "Eng- lishness." These identity studies verge on, as they borrow from, the theory of "postcolonial" studies, especially in the context of the Elizabethan (re)conquest of Ireland. That said, it is important to stress that one of the most sig- nificant books to be published in 2001 is Valerie Traub's Renais- sance of Lesbianism in Early Modern England, based on a series of articles she has been publishing for the last decade. Combin- ing a powerful intervention into the history of sexuality, the his- tory of the family, and "queer theory," Traub's study builds on the twentieth-century achievements of feminist criticism and scholarship into alternative sexualities. I first thought to call this a "groundbreaking" book which "opens" up a whole new field (the study of female same-sex erotic desire), formerly understood, in Traub's own formulation, to be of relative "(in)significance" (p. 158). Second thoughts, however, present the book more as a capstone to the queering of the Renaissance insofar as it finally supplies a crucial missing term (female-female eroticism)-which thus makes it possible now to integrate queer theory into the history of sexuality as a whole. Traub's book not only brilliantly locates a lost history of female-female eroticism, it also narrates a history that almost entirely changes our sense of the develop- ment of heterosexuality during the seventeenth century.</page><page sequence="3">Maureen Quilligan 235 The study of power politics has offered up mature work that focuses on court cultures. But such sites are now more fully in- tegrated into the study of a broader reach of social activities, including press censorship, manuscript circulation of the news, and even pornography. Fairly new to the field is what might be termed ecological criticism: this is represented by a study of ani- mals, Erica Fudge's Perceiving Animals: Humans and Beasts in Early Modern English Culture, which focuses on the problematic line drawn between the human and the nonhuman, as well as by a few essays that aim to investigate the beginnings of ecological consciousness in some Renaissance poets, and two collections of essays, some of which deal with the Renaissance. Timothy Sweet's American Georgics: Economy and Environment in Early American Literature attempts a truly transatlantic project; it does not fulfill that goal, but it does open up a far more historically responsible kind of ecocriticsm. So new is this field that its terms seem al- most comical; that it is clearly a critique we need to understand as quickly as we can only adds to one's sense of its at-present somewhat juvenile procedures. ARGUMENTS ABOUT EMPIRE Possibly the two most important books on New World topics in 2001 are Shankar Raman's Framing "India": The Colonial Imagi- nary in Early Modern Culture, and Barbara Fuchs's Mimesis and Empire: The New World, Islam, and European Identities. Raman paints a massive canvas to outline what colonialism means in the Renaissance, beginning with the changes to medieval Aristo- telian philosophy wrought by Renaissance cartography and Baconian science and locating the origins of Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis in the subjectivity created to handle European colonial adventuring. The temporal spread is matched by the geographical, as Raman tracks the Portuguese mercantile empire in India, Francis Drake's incursions into that empire in the Spice Islands, and John Dryden's celebration of the British conquest of the Dutch in the Near East. Breathtaking in its reach, this study brilliantly illuminates small textual details in the ex- emplary works of literature which Raman reads with a powerful and precise Marxist critique. Beginning with the centrality of cartography to the Portuguese voyages to India, Raman articulates how space became redefined in such a way as to throw into question the stabilities of the medieval cosmos. Simply by measuring space differently-not</page><page sequence="4">236 Recent Studies cadastrally (that is, concretely locating humanity within divine creation), but geographically (that is, abstractly ordering stan- dardized measurements)-Renaissance maps allowed a funda- mentally instrumental relationship between man and the natural environment to develop, a relationship that radically changed man's experience of his own subjectivity. Contrasting the Portu- guese empire with the subsequent Spanish one, Raman argues that the abstract grid the Spanish laid over the New World by constructing uniformly designed colonial towns, which required the eradication of native habitations, was similar to the Portu- guese attempts to master the trading networks of the Indian Ocean which did not require eradication, but simply total control over pre-existing networks. "India," in such a project, names not so much a real "place" of culturally valuable objects as a desire for domination over newly articulated abstract spaces. Raman turns from Luiz Camoens's epic, the proof text of the Portuguese empires, to theater to outline Britain's belated but exemplary entry into the colonial arena. Reading John Fletcher's The Island Princess, Raman understands that a major problem for the English was a class distinction between gentry and mer- cantile attitudes toward an empire either of conquest and coloni- zation or of trading and maritime power. While the gentry tended to support the Virginia Company (forty-seven percent of its fi- nancing came from this class) and territorial (read "aristocratic") ventures, the merchants of the East India Company (only four- teen percent of the capital for which came from the gentry) jeal- ously guarded their class rights against aristocrats. Both companies were founded within a few years of each other, but the differing class agendas needed to be made coherent: the play brilliantly solves the problem by casting the heroes-gentleman adventurers (knights)-as merchants in disguise; thus "mercan- tile imperialism" is born and the European ships plying the sur- face of Renaissance maps can carry both "factors and guns" (p. 171). Perhaps the most remarkable insight of this book, suggestive in so many ways, is the argument launched in relation to the Indian boy in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Asking why the boy is Indian, Raman builds on Louis Montrose's semi- nal reading of the gender asymmetries of the play to understand that the patriarchal politics of the play reads the colonization effort as a version of its oedipal problems. In contesting owner- ship of the Indian boy, Oberon and Titania are contesting control over colonial merchandise. "By restoring the Indian Boy to his</page><page sequence="5">Maureen Quilligan 237 proper place, Oberon establishes the nuclear family and mercan- tile exchange as normative forms of social life" (p. 274). As Indian and as boy the changeling reveals how "the politics of trade and colonialism are ... directed to a single end, that of producing the phantasmal trace of the other through which the Western male subject constructs itself as Western and male" (p. 278). Taking a more narrowly focused view of the Spanish imperial project, Fuchs makes a persuasively literary investigation, sug- gesting how crucial the restriction on the circulation of books of romance was to Spain's New World undertaking. Because they feared that Native American readers would learn to disbelieve the Bible if they were also to read untrue things in books, the Span- ish denied to the Indians the specific kind of literature so funda- mental to the mentality of the conquistadors themselves. Spanish experience in the New World, already complicated by their con- flict with the intimate peninsular others, the Moors, "altered Eu- ropean attitudes toward truth in literature" (p. 6). Fuchs locates this most interesting anxiety in Torquato Tasso's problems with the marvelous in his epic: "What seems on the face of it a purely European discussion about the ideological implications of romance comes into sharper focus when juxtaposed with anxieties about the marvelous worlds that Europe was attempting to digest while Tasso wrote" (p. 8). Moving to a consideration of epic in America, Fuchs argues that Alonso de Ercilla's La Araucana and Gins Perez de Hita's Guerras civiles de Granada, simultaneous bestsellers in 1590s Spain, both demonstrate how valorous military enemies such as the Moors and the Incas cannot be so easily othered. Both texts end by revealing "fractures of sympathy" (p. 62) that undermine the Spanish imperial program. Tracing the complications of sub- ject positions in two other texts, the mestizo writer Sebastian Garcilaso de la Vega's Commentarios reales de los Incas, and an- other by the native Peruvian Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, Fuchs notes that Louis Althusser's standard sense of interpellation "fails to account for how Garcilaso and Poma talk back to Spain" by managing to manipulate Spain's racialized religious ideology for their own purposes (p. 65). Analyzing petitions against the 1567 decrees prohibiting Moorish cultural practices and the fabricated Moorish histories of the fall of Spain to Islam, Fuchs argues that "these ostracized others imitated the Spanish self so well and addressed its religious needs so completely, they could never be completely disentangled from the self' (p. 117).</page><page sequence="6">238 Recent Studies Reading plays such as John Heywood's Fair Maid of the West and William Rowley's Fortune by Land and by Sea, Fuchs not only qualifies to be in this review, she also traces the disappoint- ments the English faced when they discovered their exploits would never be like the conquistadors; "[t]he vanishing banquet that tantalizes the starving Europeans in The Tempest serves well as a metaphor for the expected abundance that vanished when the English arrived in the New World" (p. 138). A final chapter re- turns to Spanish concerns with a study of La Dragoneta, an epic about Drake, the quintessential English pirate. Equating English depredations on the Spanish New World empire with the attacks of the Ottoman Turks against Europe, this poem reanimates the parallel between the Reconquista and the Conquista. Fuchs points out that this is a fundamentally imitative concept; the equation of Islamic Barbary corsairs with English pirates demonstrates the pervasive cultural function of mimesis, which can often allow the imitator to destabilize the original. To take the concept of mimesis as a cultural tool is a very powerful move and one Fuchs does with real elegance in this book. This is a new and indeed widely applicable set of tools, and her call for further comparisons-between, for example, the En- glish experience in Ireland and the Spanish with the Moriscos- does most suggestively instruct us that "the manipulation of sameness and difference appears as a constant preoccupation" of the period (p. 165). Such a book demonstrates how leaving Spain out of English Renaissance studies has cost us a great deal indeed. Mimesis and Empire does a lot more than recuperate that loss. Focusing on the language of travel literature and political theo- rizing as well as on the ideological side of theological discourse, David Armitage makes an almost completely nonliterary argu- ment for the foundation of England's empire in The Ideological Origins of the British Empire. The book is intellectual history rather than literary criticism: it appears in the "Ideas in Context" series from Cambridge University Press. Literature figures very little, if at all, but as literary critics have begun to read Richard Hakluyt and Samuel Purchas, as well as, say, The Excellence of the Free State (1656), alongside Milton's The Readie and Easy Way (1660), Armitage's texts are familiar. In this kind of reading they are made to tell a compelling and intricate story of the development of a conceptualization of "empire" that is distinctly "British" (as op- posed to "English" or more generally "European"). Like all Euro- pean empires, the British one began its theorization in</page><page sequence="7">Maureen Quilligan 239 self-conscious rehearsals of the Roman empire. Thus humanism had much to do with making ideologically possible Henry VIII's state formation as also a form of empire building, not merely because the word "British" comes from Brute, the mythical Ro- man who founded the empire. Armitage at first steers well clear of the New World and indeed points out that ideological theoriz- ing was quite purely homegrown in the sixteenth century; Spenser was unique when he included Virginia in Elizabeth's empire. (Hakluyt fails to promulgate a British empire because his focus is purely on the achievements of the English.) Armitage's interest in Hakluyt and Purchas is to uncover just what part their Protes- tantism played in their conceptualizing the westward plantings; although both were Anglican divines and held high offices in the Church, their religion, Armitage finds, had little impact on their thinking. Purchas is less relentlessly secular than Hakluyt, and also far more British, seeing England, Scotland, and Ireland as a "trinitie" forming "this Israel of Great Britain" (p. 85). According to Armitage, "[t]he ideological origins of the British Empire were identifiably Protestant only in so far as they related to rights of possession, and not as they informed the empire with a saving mission, a particular place within eschatological time" (p. 91). Further than that, Protestantism was so fissured and fractured itself in the seventeenth century that it endowed the ideology of the empire with a similar instability (and, presumably, flexibil- ity). One emphatic difference from other imperial projects, ac- cording to Armitage, is the ultimate seventeenth-century insistence on the "liberty" of the British empire, deriving from the resolution of the conflict between the understanding of territorial waters around the islands of the Three Kingdoms as a "closed sea" (mare clausum) or "open sea" (mare liberum) in favor of open- ness. The stage was set then for the legal understanding of the empire of the seas to ensure the freedom of commerce. Armitage pursues his story through the Restoration into the eighteenth century. Set next to Raman's far more literary investigation, this history moves by small piecemeal increments of text-after-text theorizing. The argument also stays in its seventeenth-century place: one never thinks of the postcolonial questions so current with us today. This narrowed focus is doubtless what history does best, as opposed to literature and its criticism. But it does suggest that Shakespeare intuited something very complex and interesting when the Indian boy gestates next to the embarked traders on the flood. Raman is not wrong to see empire there, and Armitage explains in painstaking detail just why.</page><page sequence="8">240 Recent Studies Patricia Palmer's Language and Conquest in Early Modern Ire- land: English Renaissance Literature and Elizabethan Imperial Expansion-almost as if summoned by Fuchs's book-provides a comparison between the Elizabethan (re)conquest of Ireland and the Spanish Conquista in Latin America. Taking as her main fo- cus what she calls the "linguistic colonization" (p. 9)-that is, the eradication of native languages and their replacement with the tongues of the conquerors (English and Spanish)-Palmer locates the most important cultural effects of the English empire in the realm of language. Unlike the Spanish, however, the English paid no attention to the Irish language whatsoever-there were no grammars, dictionaries, or lexicons at the time that the Spanish were diligently studying Indian languages as a handmaid to con- version. Not interested in converting the populace, the English used multiple means to silence Irish as a language (aside from killing its speakers); for instance, key Elizabethan texts about Ireland (such as Spenser's View) persistently ignore the exist- ence of translators and hear spoken Irish only as a collection of beastlike noises, not a language at all. Palmer understands that the different treatment of Irish has to do with the Elizabethan assumption that the "Old English" had gone native when they took up speaking Irish-as in Spenser's worry about the contaminating effects of Irish-speaking nurse- maids. The English had learned that if one took up the native language (and intermarried), colonization was due to fail-as it had failed in Ireland in the fifteenth century. The real parallel here would be, one supposes, with the Spanish experience of the reconquista-and the analogous language would be not Nauhautl or other native American languages, but Arabic, a language with a far more distinguished tradition of written letters than Spanish (as was also the case with Irish and English). Aside from missing the further parallel, Palmer has indeed hit upon a massively im- portant set of analogies and makes a most persuasive argument for Ireland as being the forge in which English expansion was first hammered out. Nicholas Canny's Making Ireland British, 1580-1650, while it begins with Spenser's program for Ireland, is a straight historical recording, in massive and painstaking detail, of the decade-by- decade effort of a series of different English governments to make Ireland "British." Tracking the late sixteenth-century Munster Plantation, the Ulster Plantation of 1603-22, and Wentworth's Ireland of 1632-42, up to the 1641 Insurrection, Canny traces the turns and counterturns which made the decades of warfare</page><page sequence="9">Maureen Quilligan 241 and siege a far more bloody history than what was usual for Eu- rope at the time. Canny's main point is that there was, articu- lated at first by no less than Spenser, a plan to eradicate Irish culture and to replace it with a British nation in Ireland. He traces the effects of this ideological program and the various attempts to put it-and revised versions-into practice throughout the period. Like Palmer, Canny uses Spain and the New World as a useful touchstone: migration from England to Ireland matched that of Spanish settlers to the New World, although it differed in that many more women went to settle in Ireland than in New Spain. The migration of the 1610s, for instance, proceeded at the same pace as the migration to New England in the 1620s and '30s and should be considered a precursor to it. The Irish rising of 1641, as Canny sees it, was not a sudden and inexplicable revolt, but a response to the long series of forced removals car- ried out by a number of different regimes. Thus, the Cromwellian campaign of the later '40s was not the creation of an unusual monster but the result of many in governance who were pursu- ing a reasonably consistent English policy toward the colony. Canny reasons in the end, however, that if it is to be judged by Spenser's stated goal that "every Irish person should learn quite to forget his Irish nation" (p. 52), the experiment of making Ire- land British had "in every respect, proven a costly failure" (p. 578). Two collections of essays deal with the problem of "national identities" exemplified by the two previous books on colonizing Ireland, but they take much broader views of the history of the four kingdoms. One, edited by Herbert Grabes, is the result of a conference at the University of Hesse. In Writing the Early Mod- ern English Nation: The Transformation of National Identity in Six- teenth- and Seventeenth-Century England, all the contributors are German (writing in English) and the results are interestingly dif- ferent from an insider's view. The "xenophobia" of the anti-Span- ish polemics during Elizabeth's and Charles's reigns, for example, is called just that, and the idea of nation building is quite sepa- rable from the notion of the Reformation (which is not always the case in the work of Anglophone scholars). The building of a na- tion is seen alongside similar procedures on the Continent. In a suggestive essay by Grabes, the reign of Mary Tudor proves a watershed in detaching national identity from the personhood of the sovereign. After Mary, whose Catholicism and marriage to a foreigner were unacceptable to a majority in the realm, Elizabeth herself could no longer be "England" in the way that Henry V is</page><page sequence="10">242 Recent Studies "England" in Shakespeare's play. The essays treat the history of the period as an entire whole: Martina Mittag, for instance, takes Charles's execution to be in part prepared for by Henry VIII's break from Rome and the subsequent secularization of the state. While this is doubtless true, the distance from which the histori- cal moment is viewed is breathtakingly detached; broad outlines are startlingly clear, while nit-picking details recede into unin- teresting vagueness. One feels in this collection the complete absence of self-defining personal investments and it feels refresh- ingly objective. If one learns nothing really new, that may not be the point because it becomes possible to see what one knows in a very different light. The juxtaposition of viewpoints in the other collection, British Identities and English Renaissance Literature, edited by David J. Baker and Willy Maley, is quite explicit, as two historians, Jane Ohlmeyer and Derek Hirst, respond to essays by a group of liter- ary critics that includes Patricia Parker, Linda Gregerson, and Richard McCabe. Self-consciously placing itself within the de- bate in history introduced by J. G. A. Pocock about the new "Brit- ish History," the literary critics ask themselves what literary texts can tell us about the complications of national identities at the time. Parker, who deftly reads Shakespeare's Henry V to see how Fluellen's Welsh leeks reveal the subversive leaks in the heroic and coherent national identity purportedly purveyed by the play about the triumphant king, seems to have particularly challenged the historians. Ohlmeyer responds by saying that the usual his- torical documents will always be more helpful than complicated works of art, while Hirst does his own reading of Shakespeare's Tempest. McCabe argues that the inclusion of Richard Stanyhurst's defense of the Old English in Raphael Holinshed's Irish Chronicles seriously confused the ideological message of that text. Gregerson tells a tale with at least some glimmer of sympa- thy, that is, that some of the first settlers in New England really did worry about the "praying Indians" (p. 178) and cautioned, as did John Eliot, "suffer not the English to strip [the Algonquians] of all their Lands" (p. 180). Robert McGhee traces England's far more quickly abandoned efforts in the 1570s and '80s to colonize the lands around the Arctic Ocean in The Arctic Voyages of Martin Frobisher: An Eliza- bethan Adventure. An elegantly produced volume with glossy pages and beautiful color plates scattered throughout, its presentation highlights by stark contrast the harshness of the landscapes de- picted in photographs and prose: an iceberg floats in a steel-blue</page><page sequence="11">Maureen Quilligan 243 sea; a rock-strewn cleft in a barren hill is all that is left of an attempt at mining for gold on the Countess of Warwick's Island. The operations captained by Frobisher, pirate and adventurer, were an abject failure; the rock produced no gold or any other metals of value and was useful only for making a wall around the Queen's Manor House in Dartford. McGhee chronicles the sense of failure, frustration, and growing acrimony among the under- takers of this Elizabethan attempt to exploit the New World. The small remains of these attempts are still starkly visible, as no one has since come to disturb the rocks where they fell when one structure collapsed 400 years ago. The landscape of Baffin Is- land, revealing the pitifully small dent made by Elizabethan min- ers, gives real meaning to the term "inhospitable." Although the title does not in fact suggest it, Robert Appelbaum's Literature and Utopian Politics in Seventeenth-Cen- tury England deserves a place among other meditations on England's expansion out into the globe as a colonizing force. One of the most suggestive parts of his argument about "utopian poli- tics" is that Plymouth Plantation participates in the same uto- pian project of the mastery of an imagined world as Francis Bacon's arguments in the Advancement of Learning, Rene Descartes's self-assertion through reason, and James I's politics of "absolutist sublimity" (p. 49)-as imaged in some masques by Ben Jonson, or, less surprisingly, Prospero's magic island. All are part of what Appelbaum argues is a pronounced predomi- nance of utopian thinking in the seventeenth century, and by "utopian" he means quite specifically an ability to envision one's mastery of an imagined world assumed to be achievable in the future. Such a posture requires a large change in cultural as- sumptions. Cultural issues began to be negotiated in political arenas (the Court, Parliament); England begins to extend into a number of colonies and trading outposts; and a modern sense of time develops which sees it as process, so that it becomes pos- sible to feel that the "future" has already begun. With a surprising juxtaposition of texts and a compellingly coherent argument throughout, Appelbaum gives the seventeenth century a new shape. He collects together much material that has not been seen in close relation before, and he tellingly glues it together with his original definition of utopian politics. This is an elegant book. Andrew Hadfield's paperback anthology of travel writing, Amazons, Savages, and Machiavels: Travel and Colonial Writing in English, 1550-1630, is a useful and well-introduced series of</page><page sequence="12">244 Recent Studies exemplary selections by various writers on experiences in the four corners of the globe. As such it would be a wonderful com- panion to any course on the literature of Tudor and Stuart colo- nizing. Groupings are organized-the way the Jacobeans did-in terms of continents: Europe (Thomas Coryat on Venice), Africa and the Near East (Leo Africanus, Fynes Moryson on the Turks), the Far East and South Sea Islands (Peter Munday on Asia, ac- counts of Japan), and the Americas (Bartolome de las Casas on the destruction of the Indies, trans. 1583, and Captain John Smith on Pocahontas). Hadfield's introduction responsibly cautions about using postcolonial theory for understanding England's early colonizing operations, but at the same time he makes its terms clear and compelling and of some real use in thinking about the selections at hand. Seventeen plates illustrating some of the books from which the selections are taken, no fewer than five of which are John White's drawings of the Algonquins from Thomas Hariot's report of Virginia, give some sense of the physical appearance of the volumes themselves and also of how the travelers saw them- selves and the strange people they encountered. Two books on maps, one a collection of essays and the other a study of maps and memory systems, speak to the cartographic dimensions of reimagining space in the Renaissance. Like Raman, Rhonda Lemke Sanford begins with medieval cartography in Maps and Memory in Early Modern England: A Sense of Place, moving on to a discussion of the very different production of space in Renaissance maps. She then turns her attention not to the maps themselves, but to their representation in literature, opening her study with a discussion of the Ditchley portrait of Elizabeth and Spenser's map of England in the marriage of the rivers Medway and the Thames in book 4 of The Faerie Queene. She moves to an analysis of the gendered maps (which famously show Elizabeth as Europe) and Shakespeare's Cymbeline, and then on to Views of the City of London, City comedies, and pageants which move through the City. Such a procedure of close juxtaposition allows her to talk about the shared ideological constructions made by both maps and the literary works she adduces. A comparison between Elizabeth I's accession day pageant through the City of London and Isabella Whitney's lower-class female vision of the same streets some fifteen years later reveals the same silences about the poor that many of the idealized Views also offer. One of her controlling insights is that mapping attempts to control an unstable space that is gendered female. Although Sanford does not broach any of Raman's theorizations, putting her arguments</page><page sequence="13">Maureen Quilligan 245 alongside his thesis-that the internalization of the gendered nature of colonial space derives from a threatening feminine materia needing control-suggests how the new cartography might well have changed the very ground upon which the Western male subject stood. Literature, Mapping, and the Politics of Space in Early Modern Britain, edited by Andrew Gordon and Bernhard Klein, is a col- lection of essays devoted to other more local maps as a means for gaining control over specific arenas of human activity. Maps of the House of Commons, as Oliver Arnold shows, reveal the house to be not only representative of but also a representation of the contested areas of the whole of the realm of England. Caterina Albano compares the mapping of geographical space to the map- ping of anatomical space, and finds that in John Speed's maps of England, the anatomical comparison insists upon the hierarchi- cal order necessary for the proper functioning of both. A wonder- ful epilogue-essay (which really stands on its own) by Richard Helgerson-one of the early instigators of New Historicist carto- graphical research-traces the Dutch mockery of their own glo- bal reach in some odd maps made in Holland in the seventeenth century. In deft readings of a series of Netherlandish genre paint- ings, in which maps figure as wall decorations, Helgerson finds further proof of a Dutch meditation on the modern vanity that makes control over the world into a tempting and commodifiable activity; this is a temptation which, Helgerson suggests, the Dutch realized one might wish to resist by staying at home. In Country House Discourse in Early Modern England: A Cul- tural Study of Landscape and Legitimacy, Kari Boyd McBride ana- lyzes a new (and very long lived) locus for legitimacy in England. For centuries after the dissolution of the monasteries, whose lands, wealth, and furnishings were made available to gentry landlords in the Great Rebuilding of the sixteenth and seventeenth centu- ries, the country house remained a site of aristocratic power. Celebrated in a special kind of poem and also in paintings, these country houses offered an authority different from the royalty centered in urban London, and depended upon the performance of hospitality that required a specialized architecture still to be seen at Longleat, Hardwick Hall, Penshurst Place, and Knole (the names of the houses are themselves famous). McBride persua- sively argues that there is a shared and occluding discourse about social structures symbolized by the house, as newly minted aris- tocrats learned to make money out of an increasingly capitalist rationalization of agriculture. McBride's most interesting point is</page><page sequence="14">246 Recent Studies that women were strangely empowered by this legacy, even though their power was still "domesticated" (p. 73). Within the great houses, however, domesticity packed a real punch: heiresses and widows such as Ann Clifford and Elizabeth Shrewsbury could amass immense cultural capital in their inhabitation-and con- struction-of some of the greatest "prodigy houses" (p. 91) in the land. The locus classicus for the country-house poem is Jonson's "Penshurst," and read in relation to the other texts in this very long discourse (which goes back deep into the sixteenth century), Jonson's poem does more than render invisible the labor required to sustain the economics of the place. We find in the country- house poem one answer to the problematic tension between mer- cantile and gentry wealth which Raman outlined, as well as testimony to the growing significance of home (as Helgerson noted) within the globally expansive realm of England. The country house becomes the space for the construction of a centrally important imperial ideal, white womanhood, domesticated, attended by Af- rican servants, and utterly powerful as an icon if not in herself. McBride locates the end of the discourse in Blenheim Palace, a pile in which the land is buried beneath the massive structure, a monument not to a private nobleman, but to royal-actually- national power. It is an architectural manifestation of the legiti- macy in which Parliament authorized a distant claimant to the Stuart throne along with her consort, the ruler of another coun- try and scion of another quite foreign "house." THE MATERIAL BOOK In Graffiti and the Writing Arts ofEarly Modern England, Juliet Fleming boldly argues that England, suffering a paper shortage in the sixteenth century, saw a proliferation of writing practices upon a remarkably wide range of physical materials which them- selves demonstrate a far greater range for the social practices of literacy than we ordinarily allow. Beginning with graffiti, or writ- ing on walls-which was, according to Fleming, socially sanc- tioned in the Renaissance in ways quite foreign to us now-the argument moves on to embrace "whitewash" which could either erase writing already on the wall (while simultaneously preserv- ing it, as in a memory system) or prepare the surface for new writing. Providing numerous pictures that persuasively illustrate the ordinariness of the act of writing on walls, Fleming deftly finds that "language does not seem to be aspiring to full trans- parency, and is still tending to accord full..,. presence to its own</page><page sequence="15">Maureen Quilligan 247 material supports" (p. 70), a fact which testifies to an underlying resistance to a Reformation concern for idolatry. In portrayals of early modern tattooing-or writing on the body-Fleming finds evidence of a discourse that made the New World native over into a version of the European barbarian; she reads, for example, John White's picture of a Pictish warrior tat- tooed with the image of a flower found in Peru. Both Pict and Native Americans painted and tattooed themselves; tattoo thus serves as one of the first demonstrations of the ethnographic noncontemporaneity of early modern European and New World others. Such a practice is particularly apt, Fleming points out, because it "stands as a ready figure for the border skirmishing that defines conceptual relations between the inside and the out- side of social groups" (p. 111), because, of course, a tattoo relies on inserting a foreign substance into the skin, the outer surface of the body itself. A final chapter on "Pots" marshals some very elegant theory (Jacques Lacan, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Derrida) to make an argument that seems, on its face, to work against theory itself. In surveying the various means by which crockery of all sorts (pots, jugs, urns, cups, pitchers, dishes) seek to "speak," Fleming ar- gues that the vessels "underline the role played by brute, so- matic and intellectual matter in the generation of meaning" (p. 152). Such a meditation allows Fleming to propose that early modern knowledge is a mode which does not rely solely on repre- sentation or reference, but rather simultaneously "thinks through matter and accords it a sensibility of its own" (p. 164). Such an argument proposes a profound change in the way we should think about the early modern objects of our literary criticism. A collection of essays on Popular Literacy: Studies in Cultural Practices and Poetics, edited by John Trimbur, publishes a couple of essays concerned with the Renaissance, one of which con- cerns materials similar to Fleming's pots. Pamela H. Smith, in "Giving Voice to Hands: The Articulation of Material Literacy in the Sixteenth Century," studies the works of Bernard Palissy, a Huguenot potter, who produced signed objects and three printed texts about the materials of his craft. Catherine de Medicis, Queen Regent of France, employed Palissy to decorate the halls and gar- dens of the Tuileries. What interests Smith is that Palissy claimed to be able to read nature without an intermediary-which she finds analogous to the Protestant claim to read scripture without the mediation of the Church. His public lectures in Paris were attended by noblemen as well as craftsmen; his argument was in</page><page sequence="16">248 Recent Studies part that the knowledge of nature was sacred and that his manual labor was worship. Such a study puts the work of an artisan such as Benvenuto Cellini in a new light, and Fleming's pot mak- ers might also be said to be literate in the same way as the far more famous Cellini. Allied to the history of the material book but not of it, Joseph Loewenstein's The Author's Due: Printing and the Prehistory of Copyright functions, like Fleming's book, to destablize our as- sumptions about material writing practices, but he achieves his ends by very different means from hers. If Fleming comes at bi- zarre and new objects armed with elegant twentieth-century theory, Loewenstein rewrites the history of copyright by patiently, painstakingly, and with great narrative detail, rehearsing the way technological changes in the making of books ushered in a whole new way of thinking about them and their very various producers. Loewenstein argues that modern notions of copyright and authorial rights to intellectual property did not, as Michel Fou- cault has suggested, derive from the historical practices of cen- sorship, but from the dissolution of the medieval guild system enshrined in the Stationers' Company, which regulated printing practices from the middle of the sixteenth century to the encroach- ing Civil War. Breaking down the confluence of historical devel- opments that allowed for the creation of copyright, Loewenstein focuses on specific conceptual nodal points. Of central impor- tance is the change wrought by the impact of print on the handmaking of books, not by fixing the page, as many have urged, but by changing the means of production and dissemination. The manuscript book, he points out, "comes into being at the de- mand of the purchaser"; the printed book, in contrast, "antici- pates an uncertain desire" (p. 64). It is this uncertainty and the transformation of commercial relations (including the greater capital investment necessary in machinery) that transformed the book culture into the "book trade." Although the Stationers' Com- pany was chartered by Mary Tudor to control the traffic in hereti- cal books, the actual company worked to stabilize as much as possible the volatile mercantile nature of printing, publishing, and bookselling for its own members. It was this company's mo- nopolistic nature, whereby certain printers were granted rights to certain titles, rather than royal (or ecclesiastical) censorship, Loewenstein argues, which provided the regulatory practices that ultimately evolve into copyright. Loewenstein refuses to see even so late an author as Milton arguing for individual authors' ownership of their intellectual</page><page sequence="17">Maureen Quilligan 249 property. His reading of Areopagitica beautifully unravels the ideo- logical contradictions of that tract and the quite wonderful way Milton erases the entire printing, publishing, and bookselling industry when he turns books into living things, the oral echo of their authors. It is Milton's intervention not into the history of print, but into the historiography of print, which, Loewenstein argues, makes the "struggle within the book trade to redistribute the fruits of monopoly" into "a struggle for ideological freedom of publication" (p. 191). In thus repressing the history of the indus- try by recasting it as the history of censorship, Milton changes the terms and provides the ground for so many modern misun- derstandings of the history of copyright. Its magisterial scope matched only by the precision of its local details and its chari- table and humane disagreements with an earlier scholarship on which it monumentally builds, The Author's Due is exemplary literary history. It is also fun to read. Two large-and largely statistical-studies, one of English printing and another of the Scottish book trade, aim to account for the sheer amount of printing done at the time and the various social activities-censorship, wealth building, and copywriting- which attended upon this explosion of human activity. In Print and Protestantism in Early Modern England, Ian Green gives a thorough accounting of what the best- and steady-selling reli- gious books of 1500 to 1729 can tell us about their owners and readers. Most writers of such books were full-time clergymen; their output is broken down into various categories, including treatises, sermons, prayers, devotional tracts, and "mixture," which means a book that includes verses, observations, applica- tions, etc. Green begins with bibles, surveying such things as the changes in typeface, the introduction of visual aids, patterns of ownership, ownership among scholars, among moderately well- educated laity, and what he calls "the lower orders"-although, as Green argues, bibles remained prohibitively expensive in rela- tion to the penny or twopenny "godly ballad" affordable by a crafts- man earning eight pence a day-a full bible would have cost him a week's pay. It is nice to note that Paradise Lost makes this bestseller list (thirteen editions before 1729), but was clearly out- sold by Andrew Jones's "Black Book of Conscience" (fifty-four editions between 1658 and 1700). Alastair J. Mann gives a slightly less statistically-driven view of printing in The Scottish Book Trade, 1500-1720: Print Com- merce and Print Control in Early Modern Scotland, but he does provide some hard facts about the economics of the book trade,</page><page sequence="18">250 Recent Studies especially in terms of the wealth various categories of book trad- ers accrued. He also compares the value of this trade to other groups such as apothecaries and surgeons. More book traders lived at the poorer end of the scale, but prosperous traders could make as much as other venders of staple goods. Wealth peaked in the 1620s; a much larger spike of prosperity appeared for three decades after 1700. Scotland had its own very viable industry- its growth indeed cut into the numbers Green studies in England (book manufacture in America and Ireland had an impact as well). Mann concludes that the Scottish trade was larger than has pre- viously been assumed and did have its own nature: censorship was less aggressively physical than in England, for example, but the number of banned books marks it as typical of other book publishing countries. Mann gives lists of banned books in an appendix and also provides copyright dates. Associated with the history of the book is the history of read- ing, of which there are a number of studies. Jennifer Andersen and Elizabeth Sauer offer a collection of essays on Books and Readers in Early Modern England: Material Studies. Notable among the essays is Peter Stallybrass's fascinating argument about the physical effect of the codex on discontinuous reading practices, especially associated with the typological organization of the Bible into two testaments, one old and one new, which needed to be read discontinuously and simultaneously-a thing not possible when the book is organized as a scroll where it is impossible to flip back and forth easily between different parts of the text. Stallybrass suggests that the development of aids to reading the Bible ("alphabets," verse numbers) increases the ease of discon- tinuous reading, or searching the scriptures, and empowers in- dividual readers to check their own texts against the preacher's arguments (as is illustrated by numerous pictures of congrega- tions listening to preachers with books spread open in their laps). Michael Mendle surveys the mass printing of cheap pamphlets which exploded on the scene in the 1640s. Mendle's emphasis is not on the pamphlets themselves but on the ways in which they were collected together at the time by George Thomason (forming the basis of the British Library collection), George Clarke (Worces- ter College, Oxford), and the earls of Bridgewater (Huntington Library). Uncategorizeable according to traditional distinctions among printed volumes, the pamphlets were sewn together in bundles and sold as such. Of the few extant collections, Mendle singles out Thomason's as the most heroic (in size) and points to its principle of organization-strict chronology-a thing which has</page><page sequence="19">Maureen Quilligan 251 made the collection of enduring use to scholars, Thomas Carlyle once asserting that "the whole secret of the seventeenth century" was contained in the mass of rubbish (p. 211). For some there has been gold. In Managing Readers: Printed Marginalia in English Renais- sance Books, William W. E. Slights studies the fully voiced and peopled margins of the texts of Renaissance printed books, try- ing to theorize or find a "simple working overview" (p. 96) of the function of marginalia at the time. While he understands that Derrida, a denizen of the margins, has offered a useful notion in the supplement (which supplants rather than merely adds to the center), Slights finds that seldom does the Renaissance marginalia do this, although many complained that it did. Deftly offering what he calls the "history of the page" rather than the "history of the book" (p. 6)-though, of course, he does this too-Slight's method is multiple. He surveys all of the texts printed in 1605 (fully sixty percent of which had printed marginality). He tracks marginalia in three exemplary printed texts, the Shepheardes Calendar (where he argues E. K. is Spenser); Erasmus's Latin Encomium Moriae (Erasmus answers his critics in subsequent editions with full marginal notation); and Jonson's Sejanus (Jonson drops the heavy notation of classical sources in the 1616 folio edition of the play). Slights pays special attention to the an- notation of bibles and religious polemic. It turns out that in reli- gious polemicizing, Milton is led only by John Bunyan in popular appeal-and Puritan bibles offer annotations that act as both a typographical and a theological hedge against misinterpretation, an aim doomed to failure in the face of the reader's increasing freedom of interpretation. The plates that offer pictures of some of the individual pages in question do a great deal to prove Slights's observations. A page from the Latin Praise of Folly reproduced in figure 8, for example, contains only seven lines of Erasmus's Latin text; it is amplified by forty-two lines of commentary by one of Erasmus's students (who may be Erasmus), by handwritten com- ments by another student, and by a drawing by Hans Holbein. This page may be unique in the prestige of its doodling, but it does demonstrate the sheer busy-ness that the activity of read- ing required at the time, as well as the multiple counterpoint of voices readers were comfortable negotiating on any given page. When, toward the end of the seventeenth century, marginal no- tations moved to the bottom of the page, they lost, according to Slights, their seemingly central importance and reading becomes vastly simplified. "With the demotion of printed marginal annota-</page><page sequence="20">252 Recent Studies tion to the bottom of the page, the opportunities for textual alterity afforded by literal adjacency have been greatly reduced" (p. 259). Slights argues that this means the resources for "reader man- agement" (p. 260) are also reduced, but in this he seems to be a bit unfair to his Renaissance readers who show themselves to be fully active in negotiating many competing claims on their atten- tion by the often quite complicated organization of the material page. John Kerrigan frames the two sections of a collection of his essays, taken from the years 1987 to 1997 on Shakespeare and other matters, with interesting meditations on the material book. Although other essays, almost purely appreciative, take no no- tice of questions of editing and bookmaking, the two essays that do are suggestive. Kerrigan likes authors, and the first piece is on Shakespeare as a reviser-a study legitimated, as Kerrigan confesses, by Peter Blayney's challenge to editorial consensus. Kerrigan shows us the poet "born" becoming the poet "made" as Shakespeare's revisions from quarto to folio text improve on and prove him himself. The second part of the collection is devoted to non-Shakespearean topics, but these are, for the most part, other single authors (Philip Sidney, Thomas Carew, William Drummond, Milton). The essays are witty, appreciative, learned, their point seeming to be the pleasure there is in knowing all this. Kerrigan is his own best "individual" reader-the kind he chastises Jerome McGann for ignoring in the opening essay to this part, '"The Edi- tor as Reader." McGann needs correction, according to Kerrigan, because his Marxist inflected collective has apparently no choice over its interpretations as readers, and Kerrigan wants to be able to account for very differently read texts at different points in history (or so it seems). He corrects McGann's romantic-based theories by reference to the remarkably articulate agendas Re- naissance writers had for their very different groups of readers. It is a nice point and well taken. But it would have been good to see how it would look in practice. As it is, there is an immense amount of backsliding into authorial criticism. But as Kerrigan knows these authors so well, it must be considered a strength of the collection. The understanding that readers are active and "represent not the end of the line but a component in an on-going system of knowledge" (p. 6) is one of the foundations of D. R. Woolf-s study of the history of history books in the Renaissance, Reading His- tory in Early Modern England. By studying the output of printers and the makeup of book collections gathered by readers at differ-</page><page sequence="21">Maureen Quilligan 253 ent moments throughout his period, and also by paying closer than usual attention to marginal notations, Woolf tracks the dif- ferent kinds of history books prevalent at any given time, the use their readers made of them, and the amount of interest in history relative to the rest of readers' energies. He first traces the decline of the chronicle from virtually the only form of history writing early in the period to very little in 1570, arguing that the decline is due not to humanist history, as has been widely supposed, but to the prevalence of what he calls "parasite genres" (p. 26) that took over from the chronicle. That is, the chronicle form split into an array of other genres: antiquarian works, newspapers, letters, almanacs, diaries, historical verse, and history plays-which last, Woolf notes, were probably the most widely accessible form in which the populace gained knowledge of history. From 1475 (the beginning of English printing) to 1730, Woolf finds that history books grew to comprise about 10% of all libraries, both public and private, with British and modern history gaining in popular- ity throughout the period while classical texts continue to re- main very attractive. Robert Burton's library contained eighty-four history titles (or 4.8% of the total), while in 1740 a smaller library contained 15.1% history books (pp. 161-2). Woolf also breaks down for us the different kinds of subscrib- ers to the Great Historical, Geographical, and Poetical Dictionary published in 1688. Out of a total of 720 subscribers, 65% were gentry, nearly 5% peers, 10% clergy, over 8% were publishers themselves, a little more than 3% merchants, over 3% lawyers, almost 2% doctors, less than 1% military-with a parallel less than 1% for university personnel (!), and only 1.5% women (p. 296). (It is nice to know that more women subscribed than uni- versity dons.) Woolf confesses that women comprise the only cat- egory that could not be counted twice, hence they may well be underrepresented in relation to the men. Woolf concludes that by the end of the period "[h]istory had established itself, both by weight of numbers and social convention, as an essential part of any library, institutional or private" (p. 322). In the midst of such numbers, I remember best the reader who cut up a page of the earl of Clarendon's very expensive tome and pasted it into a com- monplace book, evidence of some very active individualized read- ing. Almost diametrically opposite to Woolfs study in the genre focused on and the timespan of history treated is Paul J. Voss's Elizabethan News Pamphlets: Shakespeare, Spenser, Marlowe, and the Birth ofJournalism. Utterly unlike history, the "news" had no</page><page sequence="22">254 Recent Studies ancient status. Indeed, as Voss argues, "journalism" began with very cheaply circulated reports from France during Protestant Henry IV's battles for the crown, beginning in 1589 with the sud- den assassination of the last Valois king, and ending in 1593 when Henry converted to Catholicism, saying "Paris vaut une messe," thus losing the interest of the Protestant English reading public. Voss tries to make this short-lived genre (1589-93) of war pamphlets out to be the origin of modern journalism, with its concern for accuracy and credibility. It is clear that the pam- phlets were printed in order to make money for their publishers, and it is also undeniable that they brought the character of Henri Bourbon to the attention of the larger Elizabethan reading pub- lic. Moreover, as Voss argues, one of the publishers did seem to promise "periodicity"-another requisite ofjournalism-i.e., that more reports would follow. Yet the point seems to be not so much that these war pamphlets were precursors of something modern, but that they revealed the responsiveness of publishers to the need for news and that printers were attuned to the desires of readers who were very interested that France might become Prot- estant, in the same way England had, with the accession of a Protestant ruler. When that seemed not to be the case, public interest waned, and with it the genre itself. Voss's other point- that the news pamphlets gave Christopher Marlowe and Shakespeare the stuff of The Massacre at Paris and Love's Labours Lost, as well as Spenser's episode of Henry Bourbon in book 5- seems to contradict his earlier point, that the news existed for itself and not because it became source material for poets. Woolf s argument about history plays and chronicles might be a better way of conjoining the two different treatments of simi- lar material. The news pamphlets purveyed the material to the populace while the plays rehearsed the same topical material in a different mode. Such a noncausal argument obviates the awk- wardness of Spenser's being in Ireland and therefore out of reach of the news pamphlets. Voss tries to solve this problem by point- ing out a woodcut used in The Faerie Queene and in the printing of some of the pamphlets. Spenser did not need the news pam- phlets to tell him about a historical event of great moment that happened three years before his printing anything about it. It is enough that the pamphlets exist and have something more to tell us about the reading public of the time, and that a printer of such an expensive book as Spenser's Faerie Queene would also publish cheaply done ephemera. Clearly printers were less con- cerned about generic divisions than we might have supposed.</page><page sequence="23">Maureen Quilligan 255 Lori Humphrey Newcomb makes just this point when analyz- ing the creation of a differential history of reading in Reading Popular Romance in Early Modern England. Having noticed that Robert Greene's Pandosto had an unusually long life as a popu- lar book, with upwards of sixty-two editions from 1588 to 1843, Newcomb studies the way in which this "popular" title, virtually indistinguishable from Sidney's contemporaneous Arcadia when they both first appeared, had a divergent history when it became "cheap reading material for lower class women" (p. 45). During this same time, Sidney's heroic revision of his manuscript story was able to remain an aristocratic work of literature. Greene's work was always published in quarto, while Sidney's appeared in folio-this material difference marking out the quite different class trajectories the titles were to experience. Newcomb takes this pairing, and Greene's remarkable durability, as a means for un- derstanding the creation of an opposition between literary and popular cultures-which she sees happening with the Stuart deni- gration of romance. Shakespeare's Winter's Tale, a reworking of Greene's plot, Newcomb interestingly suggests, figures Greene's chapbook authority in the character of the itinerant ballad seller, Autolycus, thereby commenting on the commodification possible in the medium of print. But, of course, Shakespeare's play is itself a version of the continuing "recommodification" of Greene's work. By the middle of the eighteenth century, Pandosto could be purchased as an anonymous sixteen-page chapbook or in a multi- volume octavo collection called Shakespear Illustrated. While suc- cessive recommodifications (shortening, cheapening) should work to degrade the title, this consequence was, as Newcomb points out, not always the case, for the process could result in the can- onization of Shakespeare's oeuvre. Newcomb ends her tale with quite a flourish, arguing that Samuel Richardson's reference to Pandosto's tale in Clarissa demonstrates the peculiar conscious- ness he would have had of the material book, being himself a printer, and therefore very specifically sensitive to the complex relations between elite and popular literature. Dorothy Auchter has compiled a most useful Dictionary of Literary and Dramatic Censorship in Tudor and Stuart England. The bulk of the book is an alphabetical listing of all the texts censored from 1509 to 1714 with a detailed description of the historical context, a synopsis, and a discussion of the censorship of the text. To take one example at random: Roger Manwaring's sermons, titled Religion and Allegiance: In Two Sermons Preached before the King's Majesty, were censored by Parliament.</page><page sequence="24">256 Recent Studies Manwaring was one of Charles I's chaplains; his two printed ser- mons argued that the king was owed automatic obedience by his subjects, and that he ought not to have to sue for Parliament to raise taxes. As Auchter puts it, '"There is little wonder that Parlia- ment took offence at these sermons, not only for the absolutist principle they advanced, but for the highly tedious and repetitive nature of the sermons" (p. 289). It is nice to see that being boring at some point in history received its true recompense. Sentenced to three years in prison, fined ?Y1000, he had to stand penitent in the House of Lords and confess; he was also suspended from the ministry for three years. However, on the king's warrant, Manwaring was released from prison after only a month and was appointed to a lucrative clerical post. As this example shows, the entries are intrinsically fascinat- ing, dealing as they do with necessarily incendiary material. This is a very handy compilation and should be of real use as a refer- ence book. Reading through it seriatim is a disjunctive and quite ahistorical experience. Arranged alphabetically, the entries skip back and forth in time, and while the contexts are profoundly different, the reader begins to notice that there is a certain mo- notony to the response of the censored. Almost all of them (even Edmund Campion, who was executed) have something concilia- tory to say in the face of what must have been the terrifying power of censorship. Cyndia Susan Clegg, in Press Censorship in Jacobean England, enables us to understand why many were terrified: "Censorship in early modern England inevitably has been linked to public punishment. Authors bear their offense's marks on their bodies; books burn in public squares" (p. 90). The only men to be cen- sored under Elizabeth I for purely political (as opposed to reli- gious) reasons, were, however, John Stubbs and his printer, who had their right hands cut off. As Clegg points out, not all censor- ship was so public, and indeed under James, less than one per- cent of all books published between 1603 and 1625 was censored. James's first experience had begun with Scottish censorship, which was all at the king's discretion. Because, Clegg points out, he assumed that England had the same system of censorship as Scotland, he demanded that Elizabeth punish Spenser for his unflattering portrait of his (already executed) mother, Mary Queen of Scots, in the figure of Duessa in book 5 of The Faerie Queene. While James adjusted to English traditions, his own interest in the press, having published a number of books himself, made him more concerned about its power to act as a means for voic-</page><page sequence="25">Maureen Quilligan 257 ing competing social programs. Cases concerning the different purview of common versus civil law, the various factions of the Church, not to mention king and Parliament, all contended in the press. "Censorship proceeded not only from persons jealous of their honor and authority but from institutions. Between 1603 and 1625, parliament, the Church, and the High Commission all sought to suppress books they perceived as infringing upon their special privileges" (p. 125). If Loewenstein is right to say that the modern sense of authorship does not take its origin from censor- ship, neither should we assume that censorship does not have a profoundly fascinating history in and of itself. Clegg tells the story with scholarly care and narrative verve, focusing on the intricate details of individual cases. QUEER THEORY Making visible what is "behind the seen" (p. 36), Traub reads a vast amount of cultural material with great historicizing power (including an increasingly explicit series of portraits of Queen Elizabeth I) to reveal that the Renaissance was fully aware of the erotic, self-pleasuring female body. Reading early modern medi- cal manuals, Traub argues how earlier in the period anatomical bodies and erotic behaviors were mapped onto each other, so that the threateningly visible tribade was made to look very dif- ferent from the chaste female friend. Otherwise, feminine friend- ship was imagined in a pastoral elegiac (Ovidian) mode, Traub argues, so as to render it essentially insignificant to the repro- duction of patriarchy. As the seventeenth century progressed, however, these two figures coalesced and by the final years of the seventeenth century, the chaste friend began to absorb into her figure the behaviors previously attributed to the "unnatural" tri- bade. Traub's arguments with current feminist theory are instruc- tive, but it is with the history of sexuality per se and the history of marriage and the family-two projects which, Traub argues, have all too happily proceeded without awareness of each other- that Traub makes her most important interventions. From the vantage point of tracing representations of female homoeroticism, Traub understands there to have been a true "crisis" in the patri- archal system that organized sexuality in the seventeenth cen- tury. It was resolved only by the creation of a new construct which she calls "domestic heterosexuality" (p. 323). Against this new construct, chaste femme love becomes more and more threaten- ing, visible, and in need of control. And it is in this context that</page><page sequence="26">258 Recent Studies some women finally write about female sexual desire for other women, a story which Traub finds in the work of Margaret Cavendish, Aphra Behn, and Katherine Philips. A tour de force of theoretically informed inquiry, this is cultural history at its most powerful and elegant-completely rewriting the history of sexu- ality in the seventeenth century. Stephen Guy-Bray's Homoerotic Space: The Poetics of Loss in Renaissance Literature is a more straightforward study than Traub's, in that it locates a "space" for thinking about male ho- moerotic love and loss in very traditional Renaissance imitations of classical texts. First articulating an elegiac homoeroticism in Theocritus and Vergil, Guy-Bray then reads some Renaissance Latin elegies by Baldassare Castiglione, the earl of Surrey, and Milton, and finds there destabilizing effects similar to Traub's. According to Guy-Bray, Surrey's elegy for the duke of Richmond, his childhood playmate, and Milton's for Charles Diodati, both elegize the impossibility of male homoeroticism, which can thus articulate itself only as irreparable loss. Reading more overtly expressive texts by William Browne, Marlowe, and Richard Barnfield, Guy-Bray traces the screen provided by imitations of Vergil but ends by arguing that even in such texts we can see how the homoerotic space of classical pastoral finally disappears, leaving only the grief that itself is unable to speak its name. Un- like Traub's powerful historical argument, Guy-Bray courts his own anachronism; his unapologetic modernity, however, does not really compromise the local pleasures of his humanist readings of densely layered texts. WOMEN'S WRITING Five collections of essays devoted to understanding women's writing in relationship to their very various domestic activities attest to the manifold ways by which women gave shape to their experience in a number of different expressive forms. Taken as a group they represent the remarkably broad spectrum on which women's studies continues to work in the Renaissance-and per- haps in their overlapping paragraphs, contributors, and objects of focus, they also represent how collaborative scholarship has become. (When Nancy Vickers, Margaret W. Ferguson, and I went hunting for a publisher for Rewriting the Renaissance in 1982, we were told that no one would buy a volume of essays by mul- tiple contributors on a Renaissance topic-it didn't matter what the topic might be. In 2001 the essay collection by different au-</page><page sequence="27">Maureen Quilligan 259 thors has become a major tool of our trade, enacting and en- abling the truly collaborative conversation which powers some of the best scholarship in all areas of inquiry, not just women's studies.) In Women's Writing and the Circulation of Ideas: Manuscript Publication in England, 1550-1800, editors George L. Justice and Nathan Tinker have assembled a collection of essays that speak to a tendency of women writers to seek publication not in print but in manuscript, even after print culture has been well estab- lished. What Justice calls "scribal publication" ( p. 11) held on even into the late eighteenth century; he traces the choice of Frances Burney to publish (like Alexander Pope) in the "dirtied" (p. 203) marketplace of the day but only in the novel form, taking as a singular case the nonperformance of one of Burney's plays in which she critiques the self-indulgence of coterie publication. That she ultimately "suppressed" this play after a vigorous manu- script circulation suggests how vulnerable women writers re- mained to the potential for scandalous publicity. Mary Sidney Wroth was one of the first women to suffer the opprobrium of scandal with the publication of her huge romance, The Countess of Mountgomerie's Urania (1621). Michael Brennan takes up the creation of Wroth's authorship on the part of two people, Jonson and Wroth herself. In a series of manuscript po- ems that were ultimately collected in Jonson's Works, Jonson announced Wroth as the inheritrix of the Sidney family's patron- age and as a writer in her own right. The Sidney family bulks large in the collection, as two other essays devoted to the count- ess of Pembroke study the effects of her decision not to print the translation of the Psalms she completed, but to circulate it only in manuscript. Such a decision, the essays agree, had less to do with the "stigma" of print especially problematic for a female writer, than with the countess's concerns over the theologically idiosyn- cratic nature of the translation which she expected would be con- troversial. She therefore elected scribal publication because it would be easier to control. Other women throughout the seven- teenth century and into the eighteenth century chose to publish, like the countess, both in print and in manuscript coterie circu- lation. In Maternal Measures: Figuring Caregiving in the Early Mod- ern Period, edited by Naomi J. Miller and Naomi Yavneh, Susan Frye's discussion of "Maternal Textualities" is of special interest. She argues that needlework was not the silencing mechanism we have been told it is from masculinist discourse. It was not op-</page><page sequence="28">260 Recent Studies posed to writing, but a literate activity through which girls learned the alphabet and by which women congregated in communities of great power within the domestic space. Her proof texts are the wall hangings created by Elizabeth Talbot (and her professional needlemen and women) at Hardwick Hall and Elizabeth Tudor's teenage embroidery of book covers. Like Fleming's argument about wall painting, Frye's understanding that embroidery is also a writing practice allows us to move beyond our usual assump- tions about what letters are. Two essays on music in this same collection, one by Linda Austern concerning the music and pic- torial representations of women music makers and another by Claire Fontijn on representations of Mary in seventeenth-cen- tury Italian song, demonstrate the real "interdisciplinary" reach of the volume. McBride's piece on native-American mothers, in- cluding Pocahontas and Sacajawea, as well as articles on Spain, Germany, and France, demonstrate the geographical range. Co- piously illustrated, the volume moves scholarship in the right direction-transatlantically and toward the undiscovered conti- nents of motherhood and women's communities. As editor of another collection of essays, Domestic Arrange- ments in Early Modern England, McBride borrows from some of her work in the book on country-house discourse and makes it the foundation for her understanding that domesticity, whatever the scale of the domus, is an important site of study. With essays on writings by Cavendish and Behn, the collection sees domes- ticity from the point of view of women, but juxtaposes it to revi- sionary work on more canonical texts. A clear and lucid account of Cordelia's predicament in King Lear by Stephanie Chamber- lain shows how an understanding of actual inheritance laws as they apply to women illuminates the great transgressions Lear contemplates in the opening scene of the play, not only coming close to incest, but clearly abrogating traditional rules of equal portions for daughters. A collection edited by Barbara Smith and Ursula Appelt, Write or Be Written: Early Modern Women Poets and Cultural Constraints, rehearses older assumptions that women were embattled when they turned to writing (not assuming, as the other collections seem to, that women wrote in a number of different ways). Mar- garet Hannay, at least, finds it no surprise that Mary Sidney Herbert should translate the Psalms, as psalmic discourse satu- rated the lives of men and women in the sixteenth and seven- teenth centuries. Women thus turned to them, in paraphrase and in private devotions, as an immediately accessible form for</page><page sequence="29">Maureen Quilligan 261 expressing their interior experiences; Hannay notes the impor- tance of Thomas Bentley's huge compendium of these paraphrases as an expression of women's truly copious writing in this vein. Shannon Miller reads very carefully the poems Mary Herbert ap- pended to her translation of the Psalms and finds in them subtle negotiations of a personal relationship with Elizabeth I as well as arguments for the queen's renewed commitment to the national project of the Protestant cause. Claire Kinney reads Mary Wroth's sonnet cycle, Pamphilia to Amphilanthus, with exquisite tact and a keen eye for punning poetic detail. A Companion to Early Modern Women's Writing, edited by Anita Pacheco, collects further essays on what is beginning to look like a canon of women writers in the Renaissance, Isabella Whitney, Mary Sidney, Aemilia Lanyer, Elizabeth Cary, Wroth, Cavendish, Anna Trapnel, Philips, Behn, and Mary Astell. Essays on these individual writers read the texts with an eye toward the quite specific individual situations of each. Patricia Brace understands that Whitney's lower-class position allows her an acute angle of vision on the functioning of an urban economic system, and the very structuring of her poetic stance speaks to the mercantile realities of print markets. Debra Reinstra makes a very interest- ing argument for Mary Sidney's Psalms, taking their formal ex- perimentations quite seriously as a means for responding to the historically eclectic nature of the biblical book they were trans- lating. Unlike a sonnet cycle, the Psalms respond to the entire history of Israel. An early editor of Lanyer, Susanne Woods gives an overview of her poet's work and life, while Elaine Beilin speaks to Cary's play about Herod's wife Mariam as a Roman history play specific to the change in England from the rule of Elizabeth to James. Shannon Miller pursues an interesting argument about the central importance of female affinity and friendship in Mary Wroth's Urania for enabling female agency, while Gweno Will- iams notices how Cavendish creates her own authority first by framing it with the status of her male relations, father, brothers, and husband. Almost as if in direct demonstration that the best scholarship is completely collaborative, the new edition of Juan Luis Vives's Instruction of a Christen Woman is the work of no fewer than nine women listed on the title page, and a larger number of other work- ers acknowledged in the introduction. The introductory material is fascinating and capacious-not only do we get a full account- ing (and generous illustration) of the many different sixteenth- century reissues of the text, but also we are instructed about the</page><page sequence="30">262 Recent Studies personal anxieties under which Juan Luis Vives worked while he wrote the tract. A conversos from Spain, Vives suffered much torment because his family was under constant scrutiny from the Inquisition (which Vives called "Fortuna"), suspected for re- lapsing to their former Judaism. During the time Vives wrote the Instruction his father was under arrest, so his orphaned sisters were helpless. Subsequently, his mother's body which had been buried for twenty years was exhumed and publicly burnt. Such a situation, Virginia Beauchamp argues (informed by the work of five other scholars), might well have contributed to Vives's sense of extreme vulnerability for females and his concomitant misogy- nist rage. One also learns as much about Sir Thomas More's humanist circle as about the text itself. The editors argue that they decided to edit the text when, in collaborative work during the last century, they discovered that there was no reliable mod- ern edition of the whole text. This edition does far more than supply that lack; it reestablishes the importance of Spain and Spain's own complicated experience of racial differences, for an understanding of humanist ideas about the reformable nature of man. The letters of Dorothy Osborne to her future husband Sir William Temple (later, Jonathan Swift's employer) have been col- lected and edited by Kenneth Parker for the Early Modern En- glishwoman editions; Parker sees Osborne not so much a radical as a woman who, while accepting the limitations placed on her gender, managed to work her own will on her world and marry the man to whom she had proposed marriage. The letters are charming, and because they tell the story of a courtship-this time from the woman's experience-they anticipate the pleasures of the novel. The introductory comments are a little scattered but earnest-a handy summary of each letter beforehand locates the reader in the saga of will-they or won't-they marry. A single essay in R. Andrew McDonald's collection, History, Literature, and Music in Scotland, 700-1560, quite brilliantly, in my view, addresses the problem of Margaret Tudor's rule in Scot- land during James V's minority. Sister to Henry VIII, Margaret has been overlooked by historians. In an essay on '"Tudor Family Politics in Early Sixteenth-Century Scotland," Margaret McIntyre argues that Margaret exercised her power far more subtly than anyone has so far cared to notice, and that it required a balanc- ing act between the demands of her natal and her marital fami- lies. This might seem to state the obvious, but as a signal instance of the "bond" between men, Margaret shows how her remaining</page><page sequence="31">Maureen Quilligan 263 ties to her brother, however tyrannical, endowed her with a great deal of agency. RELIGION AND THE DISCOURSES OF THE SELF In Reading Shakespeare's Will: The Theology of Figure from Augustine to the Sonnets, Lisa Freinkel brilliantly reorganizes our understanding of "modern" subjectivity as expressed in Shakespeare's supposedly Petrarchan poetry by analyzing it as a stage in a developing history of the figural understanding of theo- logical time. Tracing the idea of a figural understanding of time, whereby Old Testament types foreshadow New Testament antitypes-or, in Erich Auerbach's terms, "fulfillments" of the earlier "figura"-Freinkel explains the difference between Augus- tine and Petrarch as one between a peculiar kind of reader (Au- gustine) and a quite specific sort of author. Temporally, the Augustinian reader reads in a present moment which is the fu- ture of the text when it was written in the past. The text is ad- dressed to the reader in that future and only in that future can the figura be fully understood, in its fulfillment. Petrarch takes the gap between past and future/present, and instead of locating it between the text as written and the reader's reading, he in- stalls that gap within himself as secular author. As Freinkel ar- gues, Petrarch's lyric "I" of the rime sparse is related to the "ego" of the Psalms; "the Psalms help explain the transition from a psalmic, confessional, and Latin first person to the restless 'io' of Petrarch's Italian lyrics" (p. 73). It is not so much that the con- tent of desire is secularized-a switch of Laura for the Blessed Virgin Mary-but that discourse itself becomes secularized. The poetic structure no longer points to a transcendent meaning (as it does in Dante), but instead meaning itself becomes that which structures poetry. Martin Luther's own change in the use of figuralism prepares it for Shakespeare's Reformation poetics. Particularly in his in- sistence on the real presence, Luther makes figura into a catachresis (where it had been a chiasmus over time for August- ine). Flesh and Spirit do not follow one another in time; instead they are simultaneously and impossibly present. According to Freinkel, the book called Shakespeare's Sonnets, which original title she takes seriously, as a material book critic should, "deploys a theology of catachresis in order to establish a poetics of collapsed ideals in place of Petrarch's poetics of de- ferred meaning" (p. 164). She most pertinently finds the collapse</page><page sequence="32">264 Recent Studies of figure in the multiple pun on the name of "will," which attains a kind of "zero-degree of maximum density: low and high, false and true, flesh and spirit" (p. 166)-which is indistinguishably both flesh (slang for penis) and spirit. Such an argument directly challenges Joel Fineman's reading of will as "chiasmus." Reading in particular the "young man" or "procreation" sonnets, Freinkel shows that time is no means for renewal but "only ripens on the path to rotting" (p. 206). Beauty can be no ideal then, but is a fault itself, which the poet is forced to love. As being both canker and rose, beauty (which the poetic "will" loves) itself is catachrestic. Again true to the demands of the material book, Freinkel also reads "'The Lover's Complaint" and finds there an apt demonstra- tion of the catachrestic poetics she has tracked through the son- nets. With a final chapter on The Merchant of Venice, Freinkel's discussion continues to take seriously all the complications of flesh and spirit, seeing the play as another instance of the cen- tral importance to Shakespeare's culture of the theology figure, that is, the continuing importance of the relations between old and new laws as worked out in all the complications of Shylock's bond. What this book accomplishes is a major shift in our under- standing of Renaissance lyric as a fundamentally theological, rather than psychological, activity. Fineman's Lacanian under- standing-as well as many other nuanced and intelligent probings of the sonnets for psychological evidence of an early modern sub- jectivity-are not so much corrected as incorporated into what seems the far more capacious history of theological discourse. Cynthia Marshall's Shattering of the Self Violence, Subjectiv- ity, and Early Modern Texts makes a profound psychoanalytic argument about the early modern period's pleasure in experi- ences of the "shattering" of the self. In reading Petrarchan son- nets, Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, and John Ford's The Broken Heart, Marshall pursues the question in resolutely psychoana- lytic terms. For instance, when reading John Foxe's Acts and Monuments of the Martyrs, she confronts the "jouissance" of the martyrs' detailed tortures and later recognizes that "[allthough today we situate discussions of subjectivity and personhood in the domains of psychology and philosophy, in the early modern period these were primarily issues for theology" (p. 145). The early modern period in its historic specificity anticipated the discourses of psychoanalysis, which is why they can be used, she argues, to such effect. In specific counterargument to Stephen Greenblatt's notion of "self-fashioning," Marshall pursues a Lacanian line of inquiry</page><page sequence="33">Maureen Quilligan 265 that focuses on the subject's pleasure in contemplating pain. Tak- ing Lacan's seminal interpretation of Freud's fort/da narrative, Marshall understands the pain experienced by the child in re- peating the loss of the object to be a moment when language displaces reality-securing a crucial link between language and masochism. Such masochism is at the heart of Petrarchan son- net cycles. As in the fort/da game, "the symbolic rendering of a lost object negates its loss" (p. 74), and such may help to account for the exquisite tortures of the Petrarchan poet. She also notes that the trope of calling the beloved a "goddess" may, in fact, draw on the conjunction between sexual and erotic jouissance. The violence in her title is a profoundly embodied force, how- ever, and as in the pictures she presents of dismembered saints, body parts lying askew, Marshall seems not quite to realize that her fundamental concern is the body. She relies on Gail Paster and Elaine Scarry in quite central ways-and notes that Ford is peculiar in the "significance he grants to the language of the body" (p. 145). While she spends an immense amount of time explicat- ing her psychoanalytic tools, her real interests seem to lie in finding those moments when the "shattering of the self' has a theological resonance. Thus Thomas Cranmer thrusts his hand into the flames to burn it for signing a recantation of Protestant faith; and George Herbert's sense of a shattering is "then was my heart broken as was my verse" (p. 145). It may simply be that reading Marshall's book in the context of Freinkel's powerful argument made me pay more attention to the theology than I might other- wise, but Shattering of the Self seems less finally an argument for psychoanalysis against new historicism than an argument that theology is not just a discursive cover for power politics, but also itself a language that anticipates psychoanalysis. In Idols of the Marketplace: Idolatry and Commodity Fetishism in English Literature, 1580-1680, David Hawkes makes a curi- ously parallel argument to Marshall's, that theology offered a lan- guage for talking about psychological subjectivity. For Hawkes, the theological idea of idolatry is a concept through which early modern people voiced their fear and anger about the changes early capitalism was making in their everyday lives. Abstracting the experience of life, capitalism turned things into commodity fetishes; a way to critique this was to inveigh against idolatry, that is, the turning of some object into an idol. It is a fascinating thesis, and as part of the new "economic criticism" the argument is informed and au courant with the latest developments. It is, of course, nothing new to point out the language of alchemy in John</page><page sequence="34">266 Recent Studies Donne, but to understand that alchemy itself was perverted in this period into a purely material practice of turning base metals into gold and had lost its idealist foundations in the analogous relations of micro- to macrocosm, is to understand how Donne's lament for its degradation is also a lament for the loss of a corre- spondent cosmos and the arrival of a world created artificially, out of man-made customary modes of representation-like the abstraction of money itself. With chapters on Milton and Thomas Traherne, Hawkes's argument changes how we perceive prob- lems we have always noticed. His discussion of Bunyan does more, I think, and helps to explain Bunyan's strange mode of mixing allegory with realistic novel techniques. "Christian's elect status is indicated by the fact that he conceives of the world as peopled by [personifications of virtues and vices], whereas Badman's rep- robation is conveyed through his delusion that he is not an ab- straction but an independent, autonomous agent" (p. 219). A very provocative argument, freshly conceived, and powerfully made. In Imaginary Betrayals: Subjectivity and the Discourses ofTrea- son in Early Modern England, Karen Cunningham comes at early modern subjectivity through treason trials, investigating the con- cerns of three particular treason trials and the shared issues in the drama they seem to have inspired. But before she begins her specific analyses, she looks at the way lawyers were trained at the Inns of Court by conducting moot trials, that is, by trying imaginary cases in ceremonious displays. Conducted in the same physical spaces where revels were performed, she suggests that those trained at the Inns "exerted a real influence on English imaginative and ideological life by putting into discourse notions that recur in treasons and plays" (p. 25). She focuses on the trials of Catherine Howard, Thomas Babington, and Mary Queen of Scots, tracing their influence on Ralph Roister Doister and Cymbeline for the Howard case, Tamburlaine for the Babington plot, and The Spanish Tragedy for Mary Queen of Scots. Because the Howard case depended on Catherine's premarital behavior (which was not legally treasonous at the time, so the case was brought in Parliament, which subsequently had to pass laws against it), what gets interdicted is the unruly female household in which the events putatively occurred. In Nicholas Udall's play, that all-female household is redefined as a place of fully policed chastity. The connection between the trial of Mary Queen of Scots and The Spanish Tragedy turns on the importance of secret let- ters and who has the proper authority for interpreting what such letters mean; both trial and drama, according to Cunningham,</page><page sequence="35">Maureen Quilligan 267 investigate the conditions within which the authenticity of a docu- ment and its role in revealing character are shaped and posi- tioned. While such particular connections are intriguing and for the most part persuasive, the terms in which Cunningham con- nects imagined with real betrayals by way of the discursive strat- egies created in the Inns of Court seem too limited. Spenser's treatment of the same "Scots trial" shows that there were mul- tiple means for redacting the major issues of the day; to juxta- pose Thomas Kyd's purposes with Spenser's, while it detracts from the argument that law leads drama, offers the possibility that trials, poems, and plays are different means for trying to keep society from breaking down. In Early Modern Witches: Witchcraft Cases in Contemporary Writing, Marion Gibson collects sixteen different pamphlets re- porting instances of witchcraft and provides brief commentary. Installing the significance of the study within the modern resur- gence of interest in wicca and the magic arts, the book is aimed primarily at unsophisticated undergraduates. Gibson, for in- stance, explains how signature numbers operate in the pamphlets, Av being the "verso" side of A, and so forth. She includes them because they give a "flavor" of what the original pamphlets were like. Texts are reproduced in the original spelling, but strangely, there are no images of what the pages actually look like (though Gibson does tell us what it felt like for her to read their some- times very small formats). Why Routledge chose not to include images is strange--especially because Gibson is straining so hard to give a physical sense of what the pages look like. The commen- tary seems a bit jejune, but the glossings at the bottom would help a neophyte reader of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century printed texts. And perhaps with the aid of the OED online a nice sense of these material books might be made available to the students. RELIGION AND LITERATURE An older manner of dealing with literature and theology can be found in the anthology Wrestling with God: Literature and The- ology in the English Renaissance, edited by Mary Ellen Henley and W. Speed Hill. A festschrift for Paul Grant Stanwood, the volume collects essays by many from the generation of what used to be called "new" critics as well as a leavening of younger folk; Donne is the poet of choice, being the focus of essays by Louis Martz, Ted-Larry Pebworth, William Blisset, Wyman H. Herenden,</page><page sequence="36">268 Recent Studies Diana Benet, G. Richmond Bridge, and Bryan Gooch. Some of the essays are by churchmen, perhaps fitting for Donne. There are also some essays on Milton and Jonson scattered through- out. The editors speak of "theology begetting literature ... and literature siring further" theological discussion (p. 1) and here- although there are women contributors to be sure-the workings of the spirit are quite relentlessly male and canonical. Equally "old style" is a collection entitled The Bible in the Re- naissance: Essays on Biblical Commentary and Translation in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries, edited by Richard Griffiths for the St. Andrews Studies in Reformation History. Girolamo Savonarola, Erasmus, Luther, William Tyndale, Cardinal Cajetan, and Gil Vicente (a Portuguese dramatist), the Homilies of the Church of England, and interestingly, '"The Welsh Bible and Re- naissance Learning," are the focus of learned and for the most part lucidly descriptive pieces. Catholic Literature and the Rise of Anglicanism by John R. Yamamoto-Wilson asks a useful question: what use did Protes- tants make of Roman Catholic literature during the Reforma- tion? Tracking the publication in English editions of a number of notable Catholic writers, Yamamoto-Wilson demonstrates that even in the face of a lot of polemic there were Protestants reading Catholic writing. It is quite strange to see Martz's Poetry of Medi- tation missing from the bibliography. How quickly they forget. Philip Beitchman in The View from Nowhere: Essays in Lit- erature, Mysticism, and Philosophy does not, pace the title, dis- cuss a utopian vision, but offers a gallimaufry of essays on G. W. F. Hegel, Soren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Maurice Blanchot; one essay is titled "Psychotic Episode as Passage, In- ferno and Paradise" which at first promised much pleasure, but ultimately did not deal with a Renaissance topic; that left "Milton and Cabal Reconsidered," in which we learn that "Cabala in Milton has a way of coming back through the window when thrown out the door [by earlier critics]" (p. 40), which should give us hope that nothing of true value will ever be lost in scholarship. I regret that I cannot do the rest of the contents justice. Reid Barbour wrote the most serious and solid book on Lit- erature and Religious Culture in Seventeenth-Century England to be published in 2002; in it he surveys the problems attendant upon the "Caroline" Church's felt loss of a heroic Protestantism. Barbour surveys the differences between three separate attempts to reconstitute the Church: the Laudian court, Nicholas Ferrar's family at Little Gidding, and Lucius Cary's group at Great Tew.</page><page sequence="37">Maureen Quilligan 269 The problem with Barbour's treatment is that he assumes a great deal of familiarity with the material already. I for one would have liked to have been treated to a direct narrative account of the Ferrars' failure with the Virginia Company; as it is, Barbour as- sumes one knows it well and will be able to follow his comments about its impact on the religious project at Little Gidding. Simi- larly, it would have been nice to hear more about Lucius Cary's Roman-Catholic-converting mother-Elizabeth Cary, author of The Tragedy of Mariam and a history of Edward II (which Barbour takes to be by one or another of Lucius's parents, it doesn't mat- ter which). Rather than dealing with the history of subjectivity in the seventeenth century (to which he does not refer), Barbour focuses on the problem that God would be no respecter of "per- sons." Barbour worries the problem of "personhood" and how to define it through numerous sermons, poems, and comedies by James Shirley and Jonson, making a wonderful argument about Donne's envy of the early Church, which could legitimately bor- row the effects of the theater while he as preacher could not. Barbour also traces the importance of religious discourse in what we would call "science" (by William Harvey, by Bacon, by Thomas Browne), and he ends with the Roman Catholic attack on the Caroline Church juxtaposed to the emigration of 21,000 people to the New World in the 1630s. Thus fluctuated the boundary within which the advocates of the Caroline Church sought to secure their spiritual territory. SINGLE-AUTHOR STUDIES Donne-Clayton G. MacKenzie in Emblem and Icon in John Donne's Poetry and Prose tracks five different topoi to be found in both emblem books and church icons that have a particular per- tinence for Donne's use of imagery. MacKenzie is not interested in translating Donne's paradoxes into visual images, but in un- derstanding the quotidian understandings of the age as evi- denced in the possibility of everyday exposure to images in books and on church walls. Donne's use of death, for instance, is ut- terly unsurprising given the ubiquity of the skull in wall paint- ings and emblem books. The juxtaposition of emblem-book images with church-wall paintings has the most salutary effect of taking the emblem images out of their heretofore recondite and "secre- tive" coterie context and making them far more readable within their wider culture; they were a fad, after all, and spoke with the same voice as the paintings on church walls which had been</page><page sequence="38">270 Recent Studies around for centuries. The author offers up his amateur photo- graphs of, for example, a charmingly seductive female skeleton offering a rose to her unaware lover-a piquant image equal to Donne's humor in '"The Apparition" (although MacKenzie does not adduce the connection). This is not to say that the secrets of alchemical language do not play a role, but such secrets are clearly displayed in the emblems MacKenzie provides. A particularly apt image is of two naked lovers with winged souls hovering above them, recalling (as MacKenzie does argue) "The Ecstasie" and representing the union of male and female principles in alchemi- cal purification. Donne and the Resources of Kind, edited by A. D. Cousins and Damian Grace, collects together a number of essays devoted to generic investigations of Donne's oeuvre. Indeed, the issue of emblems makes its appearance here, as Eugene D. Hill argues in the wonderfully titled essay "Donne the Snake Handler" that a sermon on St. Paul's handling of a viper in Acts 28:1-6 might well have been a reference to the Donne family's ancestral em- blem, a sheaf of snakes. Heather Dubrow remarks upon Donne's elegies to women as part of the "ugly beauty tradition" (p. 59) surprisingly without reference to Nancy Vickers's germinal argu- ment about Petrarchan blazon and anti-blazon as a means to enact male poetic rivalry. N. H. Keeble talks about the stresses and strains of Donne's sonnets as part and parcel of their nego- tiation with the other genres in which Donne clearly delighted- epigrams (with their paradoxical wit), satires, and elegies. Spenser--Judith Owens offer some interesting adjustments to Loewenstein and Montrose on Spenser's position vis a vis the print market and patronage systems in Enabling Engagements: Edmund Spenser and the Poetics of Patronage. Reading the dedi- catory and commendatory sonnets appended to various early volumes of verse and The Faerie Queene, Owens argues that Spenser used the print market as a means for standing apart from court-centered Petrarchan supplication, in order to speak to the baronial and belligerent radical Protestant wing against Elizabeth's pacific pblicies. She makes a very subtle and persua- sive argument from the insertion of seven extra dedicatory po- ems to The Faerie Queene during John Wolfe's print run, pointing out that the poems are grouped in specific ways that insist on ever more martial engagements, specifically in Ireland. We have all known that the epic has far more than the normal amount of dedicatory materials; Owens tells us why and in the process</page><page sequence="39">Maureen Quilligan 271 recalibrates our sense of Spenser's negotiation of print and pa- tronage. Three of the added seven sonnets were addressed to licensers of the press. She also finds Spenser to be especially critical of Sir Walter Raleigh in the dedicatory poem and espe- cially in the Timias episode, chastising him for his Petrarchan passivity. This is a short but pertinent contribution to material book studies which fits the first part of The Faerie Queene into a nationalist-imperial agenda. Spenser Studies: A Renaissance Poetry Annual 16 offers an eclectic mix of Spenser topics with two articles on Sidney. Em- blems make their appearance here as well in a study of Busyrane's torture of Amoret and her 1590 union with Scudamour: one quite horrific image printed by Laurel Hendrix does indeed "recall" the hermaphrodite image of the lovers' union. One had no idea how awful the image looked until seeing Bartholemy Aneau's "Picta Poesis." The numerous plates illustrating many of the essays dem- onstrate once again that Spenser studies is an apt place for schol- arship of the material book as Spenser's text has changed so little over the centuries, weird spelling, woodcuts, and all. Clare Kinney chronicles a late-seventeenth-century re-poetizing of book 1 of The Faerie Queene into heroic couplets; for the best com- ment on Spenser's strange and outdated stanzas, however, one must still go to Pope's perfect parody in '"The Alley": which memo- rably ends "bad neighborhood I ween." Milton-In Milton among the Romans: The Pedagogy and In- fluence of Milton's Latin Curriculum, Richard J. DuRocher seeks to find the traces of Milton's idiosyncratic Latin pedagogical plan in Paradise Lost, such as, for instance, the effect of the practical Vitruvian investigations of architecture on the construction of Pandemonium in book 2, or Pliny's personified earth in the scenes of the creation and fall of the natural world. As with all such source studies, the argument always seems to claim too much exclusive causality for the text at hand; doubtless Pliny is one of the strands influencing Milton's rewrite of Genesis (where there is no personified earth), but to reduce the power of "earth felt the wound" (PL 9.783) to this one bit of Milton's reading seems a grave limitation in understanding how the line works. What seems most valuable about this study is not the influence the pedagogy had on the poetry, but the great difference of the pedagogy itself from humanist education of the century before. Finally, the edu- cation Milton got rather than the one he gave seems to answer for more of the poetry.</page><page sequence="40">272 Recent Studies The education Milton gave himself is the focus of Jeffrey S. Shoulson in Milton and the Rabbis: Hebraism, Hellenism, and Christianity, a book which is far more compelling, learned, and in all ways persuasive than the study of Milton's Latin curricu- lum. Juxtaposing five centuries of Rabbinic commentary on the Bible (Midrash) with Milton's polemic pamphlets, Paradise Lost, and Samson Agonistes, Shoulson shows how Milton's reading in this material influenced him-but also how his own commentary on biblical issues can illuminate Midrash. Two of the most im- portant insights-among many important arguments-are 1) that Milton may have owed his particularly problematic representa- tion of the anthropomorphic and tyrannical God in book 3 to a typical rabbinic practice of unflattering depictions of God as earthly tyrant in order to demonstrate the necessity of the reader's exercising full agency when interpreting God, and 2) that Milton may well owe his monism to Midrashic commentary. The unsutured nature of the body in Milton has many ramifications, not merely the possibility of prelapsarian sexual intercourse (which Shoulson is quick to explain Milton does not owe entirely to Midrash), but also the importance of female procreation. As as- sociated with classical literature, this creativity is dangerous; but if looked at in terms of J's Genesis and the Midrashic commen- tary on it, human desire is part of Adam's own creation. Calling attention to the similar political positions of the rabbis after the destruction of the temple and Milton after the Restoration, Shoulson elegantly attends to many far smaller, lexical, similari- ties, placing old cruces in new contexts and at the same time illuminating a tradition of wise and humane conversations car- ried on over centuries about the meaning of a single book. John T. Shawcross offers in John Milton: The Self and the World a confessedly "psychological" portrait of Milton "as anal personality, Milton conditioned by oedipal influences, and Milton as one caught in conflict between his self and world" (p. 5). Shawcross uses his notable knowledge of even the minutest de- tails of Milton's life to enter into his mind and to guess what might have been going on there at some particular time. Milton "might have" thought this and "may have" felt that. All sugges- tions are perfectly plausible and we do get a feel for the life. But one is reminded of what Foucault said about the author func- tion: it is a principle of thrift. One does not need to do a whole range of other things when one is dealing with an author's mind. Our plausible guess as to its content at any given moment is all we need do. At those moments where Shawcross leaves chronol-</page><page sequence="41">Maureen Quilligan 273 ogy behind and takes up some larger issue overarching Milton's personality, such as, for example, the status of "covenant theol- ogy" in the seventeenth century, the argument takes on far more point and purpose and seems to have something far more useful to say about the poem than that Eve's narcissism may owe some- thing to her author's similar personality dysfunction. Roy Flannagan's John Milton: A Short Introduction is a very appealing way to meet Milton the person, aimed at the under- graduate or beginning graduate student who wants to know more about the author. It is straightforward, clear, and indeed quite fascinating (I've never felt so physically located with respect to Milton's London neighborhood or fully appreciated that boy Milton may have run into Shakespeare and Jonson). We also learn that it only takes ten hours to read Paradise Lost out loud with a group-and that a whole different experience thereby unfolds for those who stick through it to the end. Flannagan thus uses Milton and his prodigious learning to inspire undergraduates to feats of their own, a not ignoble goal. Masahiko Agari offers in Inversion in Milton's Poetry what appears to be a full and thorough work-by-work checklist of two kinds of inverted word order in Milton's poetry, "imaginative and impassioned" and "description." The book also includes a full set of statistical tables of specific word inversions and their frequency throughout Milton's corpus. The frequency of hyperbaton is here thoroughly documented. Also from Japan is the forty-third volume of Studies in En- glish Literature (2002) with a lead article by Kosei Ono, "Milton's Disenchantment with the Arthurian Legend in The History ofBrit- ain." Ono's most interesting point is that by delaying the publica- tion of the text until 1670, well into the Restoration, Milton was able to make his bleak view of British history enhance his stat- ure as a prophet. THE CLASSICS-OVID RULES As even so fashionable a study as Guy-Bray's book would agree, '"The classics were the raw material of the English Renais- sance." This pronouncement is Madeleine Forey's at the outset of her new edition of Arthur Golding's translation of the Metamor- phoses (p. xi). Indeed Ovid takes pride of place among the an- cients in the twenty-first century, with one monograph and one collection devoted to his impact on Renaissance poets. But Pindar and Plato (as filtered through Marsilio Ficino) are the focus of two</page><page sequence="42">274 Recent Studies books which contain lifetimes of learning by Jon A. Quitslund and Stella P. Revard. In this group we can include Holofernes' Mantuan, Lee Piepho's study of the impact of the Italian human- ist who was deemed by Erasmus to be an acceptable model for the appropriation of Greek and Roman learning and who became a standard text for English schoolboys. As the title suggests, Ovid's Changing Worlds: English "Meta- morphoses," 1567-1632 by Raphael Lyne is itself a historical study of the different ways Ovid was handled in Arthur Golding's (1567) and George Sandys's (1632) translations and in the intertextual densities of Spenser's imitation in The Faerie Queene (1596) and Michael Drayton's reorganization of Spenser's imitation in Poly- Olbion (1612). Lyne sees the front matter of Golding's transla- tion, for example, as an important key to understanding Renaissance notions of intertextuality, and he takes seriously the signals the book as made thing can tell us about its contents. If he less able to leverage the dense text of The Faerie Queene than he is able to understand the geographical particularity Poly- Olbion shares with Ovid's epic, that is perhaps because, as Lyne acknowledges, Ovid is only one among many of Spenser's intertexts. Taking up Sandys's translation as a further extension of Drayton's concerns for geography, Lyne asks what significance there is to the fact that Sandys wrote his translation while living in Virginia. Invisible in Sandys's pre-Milton Latinate elegance, the translator's Virginia site only shows up in the commentaries (added in 1632) which continually announce that the world has expanded far beyond Ovid's reckonings: Sandys "puts Ovid's world-picture in its place, encompassed geographically, but also physically within the book, by his own" (p. 239). Lyne has an essay in a collection devoted to Ovid and the Renaissance Body, edited by Goran V. Stanivukovic. Far more theoretically ambitious than Lyne's monograph, the collection aims, in its editor's terms, to see the Renaissance use of Ovid as a distinctive "constitutive history of the body" (p. 4) which vies with medical and theological discourse and which, in its fascina- tion with sexual and physical transformations, is a "proleptic psy- choanalysis" (p. 6). Many of the essays in the collection sustain this claim, beginning with Carla Freccero's Lacan-inflected study of the difference between male and female subjectivity as voiced in the rewrite of the Actaeon myth by Petrarch and Louise Labe, and including Mark Dooley's study of same-sex desire in Ovid and John Lyly, Morgan Holmes's investigation of the disruption of an emergent heteronormative sex gender system in Andrew</page><page sequence="43">Maureen Quilligan 275 Marvell's "A Nymph Complaining for the Death of Her Fawn," and Traub's afterword, which reads the volume as a means for revi- talizing the study of Ovid to make it "more troubling, provocative, dangerous, sexy, and, in all senses of the word, queer" (p. 267). Not all of the essays find their strengths in psychoanalysis, how- ever; many of them take their power from considerations of the embodiment of literature in the material text. Ian Moulton's study of Sir John Harington's translation of Ariosto, for example, un- derstands the importance of the work from its physical, large- format printing and puts it into dialogue with Golding's and Sandys's translations of the Metamorphoses as well as very dif- ferently organized Continental editions of Ovid. Other essays in the volume deal with problems of masculine identity and desire: Jim Ellis traces the installation of heterosexual male mastery in the epyllia; Mario de Gangi follows Jonson's satirical portrait of narcissistic courtiers in Cynthia's Revels to shore up a besieged aristocratic male elite; Bruce Boehrer analyzes the sexual un- ease of the cuckold's dilemma inherited from the Amores in two plays by Jonson and Thomas Middleton, concluding that any male identity predicated on female constancy is always beyond suc- cessful management. Two essays focus on a very interesting in- terstice in Ovid's mythology for female voicings-the figure of Echo. Gina Bloom tracks Sandys's subtle changes in Ovid's language to reveal how the voice disarticulated from the body may take on female authority, much like the female "voice over" theorized by film scholar Kaja Silverman. This same figure becomes, for Judith Deitch, a means by which Spenser is able to master Ovid in the echoing refrain of his Epithalamion. In a learned and beautifully crafted work that has clearly taken a lifetime of empassioned study, Stella P. Revard's Pindar and the Renaissance Hymn-Ode, 1450-1700 offers the purest sort of hu- manist literary history in outlining why Pindar was of unique and sublime importance to so many Renaissance poets for two and a half centuries. Covering Italian and French imitations as well as English, and tracing the changing notions of Pindar, from the vatic sublime bard of the earlier period (fifteenth and six- teenth centuries) to a wayward genius (in the seventeenth cen- tury), Revard gives a fascinating tour of Pindar's oeuvres. She explains why a poet who celebrated athletes should be of such crucial concern to so many different Renaissance poets. One of the most fascinating elements of Revard's study is the compari- son not between Pindar and any Renaissance Italian, French, or English poet, but Horace. Revard argues that when Horace re-</page><page sequence="44">276 Recent Studies verses the order of address in Pindar's sacred Olympian ode from god-hero-man to man-hero-god, he delivers "a message to Augustus Caesar quite different from that which Pindar deliv- ered to Theron" (p. 43). Such detailed display of various Roman poets' negotiations with Pindar-and the impact these negotia- tions had on Renaissance poets' understanding of their own imi- tations of Pindar-adds impressive subtlety to her peeling back multiple layers of intertextuality in the poems she reads. Revard's study puts true flesh on the assumption that without the recov- ery of Greek there would have been no "Renaissance." Jon A. Quitslund's Spenser's Supreme Fiction: Platonic Natu- ral Philosophy and "The Faerie Queene, " reverses Revard's focus on the influence of a single classical poet on multiple Renais- sance followers and studies the multiple Greek and neo-Latin confluences that help to make Spenser's Platonism the idiosyn- cratic thing it is. While he capaciously surveys the range of Re- naissance Platonisms in their great variety, he plumps for a specific trio whose effect on Spenser's "mind" he finds especially important to two key passages that interest him most. In the Garden of Adonis and the "Mutabilitie Cantos," Spenser is most indebted, according to Quitslund, to Ficino, Leon Ebreo, and the French translation of Louis le Roy. One of the things Quitslund is most concerned to reorient in Spenser studies is the rift he sees has opened between male and female experience where ceding power to one or the other gender as authoritative interpreter of the experience at hand is a zero sum game. Quitslund argues for complementarity rather than separate masculine and feminine domains. A great virtue of this study is Quitslund's generous regard for other critics whose views find their way into his readings; he is not afraid, of course, to disagree as he does most pointedly with Harry Berger or with Lauren Silberman, but he does so with the greatest possible tact and intelligent understanding of their ac- tual arguments. By placing an argument about gender into the context of what has been a strong focus of traditional Spenser studies-the Italian neoplatonist "background"-he pulls the one to the foreground and puts the other into a resonant philosophi- cal context. The treatment enriches both critical projects. FORMAL STUDIES OF LYRIC POETRY George T. Wright, in Hearing the Measures: Shakespearean and Other Inflections, writes about what it is like to hear, rather</page><page sequence="45">Maureen Quilligan 277 than read, poetry. The essays selected range across genres and periods, from Thomas Wyatt to Robert Lowell, with a number of essays on Shakespeare, Donne, and Jacobean dramatic blank verse. In "Hendiadys and Hamlet," for example, Wright argues that the rhetorical figure (one in two) is fundamental to the play's concerns about the divided nature of the self (he has counted sixty-six appearances of the figure in the text). In "Wyatt's Decasyllabic Line" Wright locates Wyatt's irregular meters within the complex context of the prosodic system he inherited and the Italian one that influenced him. It is not meter but stanzaic form that is important in Donne-but Wright strangely neglects to con- sider the source for the intermixture of shorter lines with pen- tameter lines in the Sidneys' (Philip and Mary) translation of the Psalms (though he does credit Philip Sidney for doing so in some poems). A strange oversight, but it does not, however, derail his analysis of how the varying line lengths work in any given poem. Mark David Rasmussen, the editor of Renaissance Literature and Its Formal Engagements, polemically hopes, in his introduc- tion, to bring the study of Renaissance literature back to formal- ist considerations and away from its current cultural studies bent. Loewenstein finds himself conscripted into the project, but uses it to argue that the study of prosody as a somatic practice-a cultural poetics of the throat-might well be a way to understand play speech materially, as he takes the question of censorship to be tied to material and cultural conditions of printing and bookselling. Mark Womack embraces Shakespeare's plays on words, even and especially when they do not serve an overarching interpretation. Paul Alpers generously rehearses what specific New Critics had to say about Shakespeare's sonnets, arguing that one needs to work with their readings, not simply to work in antagonistic battle against them. Jonathan F. S. Post has had a charming idea for an anthol- ogy-to ask contemporary poets to write something about the Renaissance poets they most admire. Thus in Green Thoughts, Green Shades: Essays by Contemporary Poets on the Early Mod- ern Lyric, we have Anthony Hecht on Philip Sidney's sestina "Ye Goteheard Gods": "one of the greatest achievements of Renais- sance poetry" (p. 43); Calvin Bedient on Donne: "Pace T. S. Eliot, he can't be read solemnly" (p. 113), and William Logan on Milton's invention of modern poetic personality in the everyday language of his sonnets (so very different from Paradise Lost). Eavan Boland makes most clear that the poets of the present must remake the poets of the past: not surprisingly, she is a woman poet writing</page><page sequence="46">278 Recent Studies about Ann Bradstreet, another woman poet. It would have been nice to have a poem from the contributors-perhaps the one most influenced by the author under question ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES In American Georgics, Timothy Sweet returns to Vergil to un- derscore the distinction between the Eclogues and the Georgics, which see the natural world differently, as a site of leisure v. a site of labor. Sweet then uses the term "American georgics" to identify a particular type of environmental writing in which hu- manity fully engages with the natural world. He starts with the promotional literature of the Hakluyts, which imagines the economy and the environment as mutually conceived. While More's Utopia is "England's first theoretical text on colonization" (p. 15), Sweet shows how the conception of the New World as waste and unoccupied ground thus launches an American georgic. Defining such well-articulated notions as "georgic" helps us to understand the history of a particular trajectory of current ideas within the environmental movement. He chronicles the disjunc- tion between economics and environment-in John Smith's Generall Historie, the Virginia Company's decision to invest in tobacco was troubling from the georgic point of view. One of the most interesting chapters in terms of the future of environmentalism concerns the Cherokee and how they "provided a significant new means of cross-cultural self-definition" (p. 123). The struggle over Cherokee land was a struggle to define the ba- sic terms of human relationship to the natural environment in America. Sweet laments their loss because it removed a signifi- cant model for conceptualizing land use in terms of the public good. Had they not been removed, Cherokee farmers, counting on plenty of tillable acreage in a national reserve, without the complications of property ownership, could have provided a his- torical model for sustainable agriculture. Such a historical study, which understands how modern en- vironmentalism may alert us to potentialities elided in the past, exemplifies what green criticism might best do, grounding itself in a useful historical trajectory and revealing the processes of past choices which allowed us to be where we are today. Fudge's Perceiving Animals is less an eco-critique than a sur- vey of the tensions between the humanist understanding of man's superiority over animals and the radical Reformation understand- ing that man could sink lower than beasts. Beginning with the</page><page sequence="47">Maureen Quilligan 279 painful re-creation of a bear baiting in which contemporary ob- servers could see that the cruelty effaced the difference between the suffering bear and its beastly human tormentors, Fudge tracks "humanity's confusions about itself' (p. 23). Investigating the dis- tinctions between man and beast erected by legal discourse, Fudge shows again the potential confusion and breakdown of Conti- nental categories in trials of animals at the time when the guilty animal was often dressed up in human clothes to make it more exemplary to the human populace. English practice was differ- ent because the responsibility was the animal's owner's, not the beast's itself. Fudge returns to the bear garden at the end, hop- ing to find that in Leveller John Overton's writing, the garden and its cruelties are finally rejected. Not so: Overton likes the sport. COURT CULTURE Peter C. Herman's excellent collection of essays plus selec- tions of verse explicates and exemplifies the work of four rulers, two kings and two queens, in Reading Monarch's Writing: The Poetry of Henry VIII, Mary Stuart, Elizabeth I, and James VI/I. Leah Marcus, one of the editors of the recent collected works of Elizabeth I, writes about that new edition; Constance Jordan reads Elizabeth's French poems; Herman and Lisa Hopkins address Mary Stuart's French poetry; Sandra Bell and Appelbaum ad- dress James's work when king of Scotland. Herman and Ray Si- emens see Henry VIII's poetry as expressions of political as well as poetic authority. The poetry selections printed in the second part of the book exemplify the kinds of issues broached by the scholars. What is surprising is how much better a poet Henry VIII is than the others, possibly because he kept to a shorter line (John Skelton was his teacher); both Elizabeth and James used the unfortunate fourteener and the casket sonnets are so prob- lematic in their historical context that it is hard to appreciate them as poetry-as if all Henry's songs were written to Ann Boleyn or another whom he had beheaded. Henry's poems are songs to anonymous persons-and still sing. Another collection of essays beautifully printed on glossy pa- per from the British Library and edited by Marie Axton and James P. Carley, "Triumphs of English": The Life and Writings of Henry Parker, Lord Morley, Translator to the Tudor Court, considers the figure of Morley from a number of different perspectives. Morley translated Plutarch, Boccaccio, and Thomas Aquinas for Henry</page><page sequence="48">280 Recent Studies VIII, but also presented to Mary Tudor translations of Cicero, Erasmus, Richard Rolle's Latin psalter, and Seneca's epistles. A tactful aristocratic survivor of the perilous changes in Henry's court who remained a friend to Mary Tudor and a proponent of Elizabeth's succession, and who seems to have supported his own daughter's execution for treasonous complicity with Catherine Howard, Morley is best remembered for having recommended that Thomas Cromwell read Machiavelli. Does one read Morley for comments on current courtly scandals-as James Simpson reads his presentation to Henry of a translation of Boccaccio's On Fa- mous Women a mere year after his daughter's death? Or does one read his remarks, as Jeremy Maule does, as exemplary human- ist treatises that might apply to the court in the future, should the king have wit to apply the lessons? Richard C. McCoy's Alterations of State: Sacred Kingship in the English Reformation stakes out a new argument about the secularization of society; much like Malcolm Mackenzie Ross five decades ago, McCoy demonstrates that the Reformation contro- versy about the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist helped to aggrandize Tudor and Stuart assumptions about the sacred na- ture of kingship itself-and that, as McCoy's opening chapter title has it, the movement was from "Real Presence to Royal Pres- ence." Studying the reigns of three Tudor monarchs and three more Stuart kings, McCoy juxtaposes the work of a key author in each period with funerary monuments and other iconographical images to trace the development from reign to reign of the chang- ing fortunes of the king's assumed sacrality. Ironically, Henry VIII, although head of the Church, never had a tomb of his own- chantry chapels having been abolished during his son's reign. With the suppression of Corpus Christi feasts under Elizabeth, her Accession Day celebrations had little ecclesiastical competi- tion and so her cult became a virtual national religion. McCoy reads Shakespeare's Hamlet as a meditation on the waning of Elizabeth's reign-where everyone frets about the impossibility of getting a decent burial. James I removed Elizabeth's tomb and built another far more lavish for his mother, putting himself in line with Henry VII as the originator of another dynasty. John Milton and his struggle with the divine-right kingship of Charles I wittily turns, McCoy points out, on the monumental power of Charles's Eikon Basilike: "Milton's own reverence toward books returns to haunt him" (p. 104). The sacrality of royal authority, especially in death, dies hard, McCoy points out. Courting ba- thos, but finally making his point, McCoy briefly ends by refer-</page><page sequence="49">Maureen Quilligan 281 ring to the civil (and global) idolatry exhibited at Lady Di's fu- neral. This is a gracious book, shifting gears among iconography, close reading, and church history with a smoothness that belies the speed of the argument. A longer and clunkier book might have been more persuasive, but not so much of a pleasure to read. John Huntington, in Ambition, Rank, and Poetry in 1590s England, usefully reminds us that there was a group of poets who were not fixated on success within the patronage system. Similar to Owens's revising our notion of Spenser's position within the patronage and print systems, Huntington traces the early careers of a group of specifically disaffected poets, George Chapman, Marlowe, Jonson, Thomas Lodge, and Spenser, par- ticularly of Colin Clout's Come Home Again-as well as the most interesting addition of Lanyer. Huntington begins by assuming that wherever the authorities expressed hostility there must have been a real threat, even though the poems may seem boring and beside the point to us. Huntington thus finds a wonderful con- trast to Shakespeare's aristocracy-pleasing Rape of Lucrece in Willobie His Avisa, the story of a middle-class woman who de- fends herself against five suitors. Condemned by contemporar- ies, the work clearly offended against rank. Huntington traces through Chapman's earlier poems--especially his continuation of Marlowe's Hero and Leander-what he calls the "social anger" (p. 62) which is registered more explicitly in the drama, Bussy d'Ambois. Using the subtle notions of practice borrowed from Pierre Bourdieu, Huntington hunts for sociological rather than directly political critique; Lanyer's lament that she has been spurned by her aristocratic friends now that they have all left Cookeham is placed in its class context. It is time someone said it. In Solomonic Iconography in Early Stuart England: Solomon's Wisdom, Solomon's Folly, William Tate traces the use of the fig- ure of Solomon for representing James I and Charles I's royal authority. Reading masques, plays, sermons, and particularly Marlowe's, Jonson's, and Bacon's various works dedicated to James I, Tate explains how the iconography of Solomon allowed the Stuarts to figure various projects as biblically inspired: the building of the Temple becomes the expansion of the Jacobean empire, his "sloth" (p. 44) according to Lucy Hutchinson becomes "Gospell meekenesse and peaceableness" (pp. 44-5), James's learning replicates Solomon's wisdom. With Charles, however, the iconography goes through a sea change, emphasizing the Song of Solomon and the erotic romance between Charles and Henrietta</page><page sequence="50">282 Recent Studies Maria, occasioning Milton's criticism of his "uxoriousness" but more importantly, allowing Milton to criticize the lack of chastity in the court in Comus. A subtle and far-ranging argument which compellingly persuades the reader that the figure of Solomon was far more important for James than the figure of Deborah was for Elizabeth, for example, the book is quite harmed by a lack of any plates illustrating the various pictorial images it discusses. One would have hoped that inexpensive plates, downloaded from the Early English Books Online for example, could have been used. They would not have been beautiful, but they would have been most helpfully illustrative. Alastair James Bellany has written the only book-length his- tory of the Overbury scandal in The Politics of Court Scandal in Early Modern England: News Culture and the Overbury Affair, 1603-1660. As the title suggests, he sees a very long aftereffect not so much from the affair itself but in the circulation of the materials and images created around the murder and trial as they continued to be recycled in pamphlet and play. Working to expand on Lawrence Stone's early suggestion that court scandal was one of the causes of the English Revolution, Bellany demon- strates that the nexus of these events lies in the news culture that grew up in early-seventeenth-century England: that the "Staple of News"-as Jonson called it-became a powerful shaper of public opinion as manuscript news reports (called "separates") circulated widely throughout the realm and then continued to do so on into the century. Bellany does something different from traditional historiography, aiming instead to write an "ethnogra- phy" of early Stuart political culture. Less interested in what ac- tually happened, he is more concerned to trace what people thought happened and how they transmitted to others their feel- ings about the events. His work has the understandable narra- tive drive of the scandal itself; although he says he is not interested in it but in what the common understanding of it was, he gives the clearest exposition of the sequence of events I have seen. But he beautifully sketches in just how the court communicated with the country and powerfully evokes the multiple means of private and more commercialized communication at work in spreading news of-and thereby shaping-the scandal. A brief excursus on the semiotics of poison demonstrating how Jacobeans felt about murder by poison makes the drama of the period far more easy to understand, and a little less comically over-the-top. N. H. Keeble's Cambridge Companion to Writing of the English Revolution collects essays by various hands about the writing</page><page sequence="51">Maureen Quilligan 283 done during the Revolution: Thomas N. Corns, David Lowenstein, and Annabel Patterson talk about "Radical Voices"; Susan Wiseman, Helen Wilcos and Sheila Ottweay, and Elaine Hobby discuss "Female Voices"; while Alan Rudrum, Isabel Rivers, and Paul A. Salzman discuss "Conservative Voices." Two other sec- tions provide essays elucidating contexts, such as the press, re- ligious thought, and the aftermath of war, with pieces by David Norbrook on English historiography, Nigel Smith on Paradise Lost, and Richard Greaves on Bunyan. These pieces are introductory in tone; they presume no prior knowledge and would therefore be fine for use by interested undergraduates. A handy chronology helps students to locate individual texts throughout the century and another chronologically organized list gives the birth and death dates of all the significant writers in sequence. Henrietta Maria: Charles I's Indomitable Queen by Alison Plowden grants the reader an inside and strikingly familial view of the events leading up to the English Civil War. Seen from the point of view of the woman who made John Milton call Charles "uxorious," the English Civil War reads far more like the French Revolution, where feckless royals are overrun by events, than it has ever seemed before. Because Henrietta is only practicing her own religion as allowed by her marriage contract and then trying to bring up her children in her own faith, as any mother might, Plowden makes Henrietta's plight deeply sympathetic, and Par- liament becomes a wonderful villain. A very different view of En- glish history from a distinctly idiosyncratic standpoint, Henrietta Maria also allows something like an insider's view of the Glorious Revolution and the relations between Charles II and his brother James. James Grantham Turner understands Henrietta Maria to have been a major problem for Charles in Libertines and Radicals in Early Modern London: Sexuality, Politics, and Literary Culture, 1630-1685. Descended from a long line of authoritative Medici women, Henrietta was only one of a number of women whose increased agency became problematic during the Civil War and its aftermath. In response to this increased agency, Turner sees the rise of what he calls "political pornography" (p. 74), that is, an attack on illicit female sexuality such as prostitution as a means for making political critique. Such "pornography" was useful in attacking royal women such as Henrietta Maria--and later Charles II's infamous mistresses-but it was also deployed for attacking women who had participated in sieges during the war and in petitioning Parliament for their own-and their hus-</page><page sequence="52">284 Recent Studies bands'--rights. "'hese waves of'tumultuous petitioning' contrib- uted greatly to the extension of women's activity. Apart from the composition and publication of the document itself, they had to gather signatures, adopt and distribute the marching colours ... and move coherent masses of women by water and land. Under the guise of traditional defence, they articulated not only alterna- tive policies but forthright justifications of their independent ac- tion" (p. 89). The libertinism of Restoration culture, however, was alterna- tively a means to legitimize the new regime by contrast with the repressive Interregnum, although such a posture could become problematic. When, in the bawdy-house riots of 1668, the court became alarmed at what it perceived to be more than ordinary licentious tumult, it chose to punish four rioters for high treason because they had criticized the king's mistress, Lady Castlemaine. One of the more interesting parts of Turner's argument is the response to this libertinism of such female writers as Cavendish, Behn, and Jane Baker, who use it to their own purposes of en- abling female agency. Turner ends by saying that the world-chang- ing idea of feminist politics reverses Karl Marx's famous dictum: apparently feminism made its first appearance in the seventeenth century as farce. Whether or not the libertinism of the Restora- tion is an attempt to contain the female agency unleashed by radical factions during the Civil War, or whether female agency is simply a cover for what is ultimately going to resolve itself in the Glorious Revolution, is not something Turner ever makes clear. It may be a modern (feminist) mistake to perceive a difference between a collective political action on the part of a group of pe- titioning women and the power wielded by a highly placed cour- tesan, and therefore to question the legitimacy of arguing that pornographic satire can police both. But clearly that misogynist age saw no difference between them, and so Turner may be quite right to do so as well. Learned and lubricious, the book is witty, exceedingly well informed, and a little bit obscene. NEW EDITIONS Stanton J. Linden has edited George Ripley's Compound of Alchymy from the text printed in 1591. Although written in 1471 and first dedicated to Edward IV, the poem in rhyme royal stan- zas remained popular enough to be printed by Raph Rabbardes in 1591 and dedicated to Elizabeth. Linden helpfully points out</page><page sequence="53">Maureen Quilligan 285 the long manuscript tradition for the poem, which continued even after the 1591 imprint. He also explains why the treatise on al- chemy might take the form of rhyme royal; George Gascoigne supposed that, as a royal form of poetry, it was appropriate for "grave discourses" and, as Linden points out, Ripley addressed it to a king (p. xlv). The poem consists in twelve parts or "gates," the keys to which are the processes described: "calcination," "sepa- ration," "conjunction," and so forth. Mixed with seemingly pre- cise descriptions of the physical manipulations of different elements are admonitions to "pray to God devoutly that he thee lead" and complaints about the difficulty with which Ripley gath- ered the material. When one thinks of the length of time this text had currency, the overinflated stocks of the very brief 1990s do not seem so strange; people really will believe it is possible to turn base metals into gold. Janice Devereux has edited Luke Shepherd's Satires for the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies. Present- ing mostly tetrameter anti-Catholic verse and some prose by a physician who flourished under Edward IV's radical Reforma- tion, the edition tantalizingly alludes to illustrations which may have been intended to be torn off for wall decoration, but it does not include them. One wonders what they looked like and how they fit with the satirical intent of the text. Leaving one of the best for last, let me say something very briefly about Joshua Scodel's Excess and the Mean in Early Mod- ern English Literature. It fits into none of my categories, except perhaps for the use of the classics. And perhaps I should have put it there. However, as a study of the use of the classical con- cept of the via media, a not entirely original and therefore not too promising project, Scodel's book makes a hugely learned and massive argument about English literature of this period. The classical notion of the mean, and the flexible ways in which Re- naissance writers used it, allowed them to talk about empire, conquest, commerce, eroticism, Miltonic restraint, drinking, po- etics, climate, and national identity. It is as if this one book shows just how enabling the close reading of classical literature (which does get read closely) can be; and such close readings allow Re- naissance authors a supple means for talking about everything all the other books in this review discuss-i.e., all that was new and bothered them in the "modern" two centuries through which they lived. A tour de force of sustained analysis, Scodel's argu- ment shows how the Renaissance is a rebirth of classical learn- ing and modern at the same time.</page></plain_text>
