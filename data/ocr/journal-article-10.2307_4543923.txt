<plain_text><page sequence="1">360 XII.-SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. By W. R. INGE. THE position of Plotinus in the chain of great thinkers is a curious one. Many competent critics, as I shall presently show, have regarded him as one of the greatest names in the history of philosophy. For the student of historical theology he has an almost unique importance, as the bridge between the Hellenic philosophy of religion and the philosophy of the Catholic Church. He influenced Christian thought profoundly, through Augustine, the Cappadocian Fathers, and the Pseudo- Dionysius. His philosophy has been the intellectual founda- tion of Christian mysticism, and of many theological systemP, from Scotus Erigena to some quite modern writers. And yet he is so little read that the best-known histories of philosophy copy from each other the most superficial and often erroneous descriptions of his views, and do so unreproved. In our universities, the history of Greek philosophy is assumed to end with the Stoics, and so an artificial gap yawns between Hellenism and Christian speculation. Even men who have devoted their lives to the study of Plato have seldom taken the trouble to study the system which crowns five hundred years of continuous thought and disputation on Platonism. The chief reason, I have no doubt, is that the Greek of the Enneads is so crabbed that even a good scholar can make little of it till he has worked upon it for many weeks, with much tearing of the hair. The following estimates of Plotinus may be interesting: 1. Augustine.-" Os illud Platonis quod in philosophia purgatissimum et lucidissimum, dimotis nubibus erroris,</page><page sequence="2">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 361 emicuit maxime in Plotino, qui platonicus philosophus ita eius similis iudicatus est, ut simul eos vixisse, tantum autem inter- esse temporis ut in hoc ille revixisse putandus sit." 2. R!ville.-" One of the most vigorous thinkers that humanity has produced." 3. Troeltsch.-" In my opinion the sharper stress of the scientific and philosophical spirit in modern times has mnade the blend of Neoplatonism and New Testament Christianity the only possible solution of the problem at the present day, and I do not doubt that this synthesis of Neoplatonism and Christianity will once more be dominant in modern thought." This fearless prophecy, from a thinker of such eminence, naturally gives me great pleasure. 4. Eucklen.-" The third century produced the one great philosopher of this movement, den weltbeherrschenden Geist des Plotin." 5.

Whittaker.-" The greatest individual thinker between Aristotle and Descartes." 7. ])rews.-" The greatest metaphysician of antiquity." In this paper I have chosen, out of the book which I have nearly finished, certain points on which I am sure that the criticism of this Society will be helpful to me. I have avoided topics in which an intimate knowledge of the Enneads is indispensable. I have not, in this paper, given my proof that to charge Plotinus with metaphysical "dualism" is to mis- understand him from top to bottom. I have not exposed the exaggeration by which the vision of the One has been made the centre of this philosophy. I have not demonstrated that he is very far from bidding us to neglect our duties and live in a world of dreams. All these and other delusions would disappear if students of philosophy would take the trouble to</page><page sequence="3">362 W. U. INGE read the Enneads for themselves. They are the result not of misunderstanding but of ignorance. Time. Plotinus is well aware that the problem of Time is one of the hardest in metaphysics. In the long chapter devoted to it he approaches it with diffidence. and does not claim to throw any new light upon it. "Some of the blessed ancients must have found the truth. It is enough for us to select the wisest of their opinions and try to understand it." We have, no doubt, an instinctive notion of Tilme, but, when we analyse it more closely, we are in difficulties.t Time is, as Platot says, the moving image of Eternity, which it resembles as much as it can. Eternity is the sphere of Spirit, and Time is the sphere of Soul. But we must not, with some of the Pythagoreans, identify Eternity with the spiritual world, and Time with the phenomenal world. For the spiritual world contains particular things as parts of itself, while Eternity contains them as a unified whole-it contains them as they are-sub specie aeternitatis. Eternity is the atmosphere in which spiritual existences live. As for the phenomenal world, " things that are born are nothing without their future."? It is their nature and the condition of their existence to be always "making acquisitions." Each indi- vidual life in this world would be truncated and shorn of its meaningo if taken, by abstraction, out of the temporal sequence in which it lives. To talk of "living in the present" is, on the plane of ordinary experience, an absurdity. The present is an unextended point, and, therefore, reality, on this theory,. consists of two parts, the past and the future, neither of which * 3,7. t So Augustine, Confessions, xi, 14, says, "s Quid est tempus ? Si nemno a me quaerat, scio; si quaerenti explicare velim, nescio." + Timem, 37. ? 3, 7, 3.</page><page sequence="4">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 363 is real. Things that are born yearn to continue in existence, because perpetuity is the symbol and copy of the permanence of Eternity, and the effort to make perpetual progress is the symbol and copy of the perfection of Eternity.* In the eternal world, on the contrary, there is no future or past. Activity there is; but if it were possible to take a section of eternal life, as we attempt to do for this life when we separate " the present" from the past and the future, the section would exhibit all the perfection of the whole. The form of existence in the world of Time is succession (Tor &amp;XXo FeT SaXo); the stages follow each other. But in Eternity the whole is in each part; all is present together in its realised meaning and achieved perfection. Will is not destroyed, nor activity paralysed; but will and satisfaction, activity and rest, are taken up into a higher unity. The views of the Stoics and other schools about the nature of Time are found to be erroneous. The Stoics identified Time with motion (xcFos3. But motion is in Time.t Besides, motion can stop or be arrested, while the process of Time is constant. Lastly, there is no uniform speed of motion. If Time and motion were identical, there should be many times. A second theory, that Time is "that which is moved" (TO KWOUevoV), a view attributed to Eratosthenes and Hestiaeus of Perinthus, is dismissed without comment. Is Time, then, one kind of motion? It is not " the interval of motion" (Kctv 'eeoS 8&amp;arnc1u7a, Zeno), for there is no uniformity in the " intervals." As before, this theory would produce " many times." Besides, " interval " is a spatial, not a temporal expression. It may be said that motion has a certain " interval" (between the first and last states of its subject), because it is continuous. But this only * This does not meaiu that each period of Time is better, as containing higher values, than the preceding; but only that upward striving (24ect) is a constant character of existence in Time. t Cf. Augustine, Confessions, xi, 24.</page><page sequence="5">364 W. R. INGE. gives us, as it were, the dimensions of the motion, a quantity produced in Time, not Time itself. Movements, and their "C intervals," are in Time; they are not to be identified with Time. Plotinus then considers the Aristotelian deflnition,* that Time is " the number and measure of motion." The difficulty caused by the irregularity of motion here comes up again. If a uniform measure of Time (what Bergson calls clock-time) is used to compare swift and s1ow movements, we have certainly a standard of measurement, but we are no nearer to knowing what Time is in itself. Time is something else than " the number which measures motion according to anteriority and posteriority." Unless these last words are used in a spatial sense, which would be " to confound Time with Space"; they only repeat the notion of Time which they were intended to explain. Moreover, Time existed before it was used to measure with; it is not merely subjective. That Time was created by the Soul is true, but not in the sense in which the words might be used by a subjective idealist. Plotinus suggests that the Aristotelians ought to have said, and probably meant, that Time is measured by motion; Time is the measure of motion only accidentally.t While addressing their own school, they have not made it clear to outsiders what they consider Time to be in itself. Lastly, the Epicurean theory that Tinie is an accident (avv7rT7wpa) or consequence of motion is no explanation at all. Plotinus now comes to the constructive part of his dis- cussion. Time is natural (4n'oEt); it had to be. In saying this, Plotinus wishes us to understand that there are some things in philosophy which we have to accept as given facts of experience. The intellectual speculations of the meta- physician belong to the life of Soul, not of Spirit. Thing that are real to Soul are part of the atmosphere which the * Aristotle, Phymica, 4, 12. t icara av sc*qdr, 3, 7, 12.</page><page sequence="6">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 365 discursive intellect breathes. It is bound to accept them; though the contradictions which become apparent when the intellect treats them as ultimate realities are one of the means by which the soul is forced upward to the intuitive perceptions of the spiritual life. In nothing is this more evident than in speculations about Time. The Spirit and even the Soul transcend it*; but we are still so much involved in it that we cannot think it away or put ourselves outside it. It is for us a necessary form of thought. Any explanation of time in terms of discursive thought must necessarily be inadequate; but the contradictions which inhere in the notion of Time are not of a kind to condemn it as " contrary to Nature." Plotinus is so little troubled about the origin of Time that he half banteringly suggests a mythological explanation. " Shall we refer to the Muses ? " Then he gives his own view, that "Time. still non-existent, reposed in the bosom of Reality (ev Tco ovrT aie7ravETO oVKc cwv) until Nature, wishing to become its own mistress, and to enter into possession of itself, and to enlarge the sphere of its activities, put itself, and Time together with itself, into motion." Thus Time, the image of Eternity, arose through the desire of the Soul of the World to exert its active powers. " For," says Plotinus, " the nature of the Soul is restless; it desires always to translate what it sees in the eternal world into another form." With this motive the Soul of the World took upon her the form of a servant and the likeness of a creature of Time, and made the creation also subject to Time in all things.t Time is the form which the soul creates for itself when it desires to reproduce the eternal ideas as living and creative activities. It is "the life of the soul as it moves from one manifestation of life to another.+ Our measurements of Time had their origin in the *rp6Tov piv EarVTrv eXpOv'rev, dlvrl rou aLcawvor rourov 7r01aoa' aaf'rIa f7 Kat 76 7yeyOpf 'V) 'E &amp;)aKE 3OUXVV 0 XE ? 3, 7, 1l. t ov8 as #vXai 'v Xpov( adXXii Ta lrae7) ablr&amp;V KaO Ta 7arotarTa, 4, 4, 15. $ 3, 7, 11.</page><page sequence="7">366 W. R. INGE observed sequence of day and night, which gave mankind a fixed standard by which to measure duration, and in the seasons of the year. The " movement" which takes place in time is a " copy " of the " first movement " of Spirit, a tran- scendental form of activity without change which belongs to the eternal world. We are of course not meant to take literally the statement that there was a time when Time was not. In the vulgar sense of "eternity," the time-series, having no beginning and no end, is itself eternal. "Time is the activity of an eternal Soul, not turned towards itself nor within itself, btit exercised in creation and generation." It is "'the span of the life proper to the Soul; its course is composed of equal, uniform, imperceptibly progressing move- ments, with a continuous activity." Thus the external life of the universal Soul carries with it, not " outside itself," but as its inseparable attendant, what we may call real Time. This is uniform and steady, in correspondence with the unbroken activity of its creator. More limited activities, representing particular ideas in the Spiritual World, are spread out, in the world of Soul, over as much Time as is required for their completion. If they were not subordinate to the one all-embracing life of the Universal Soul, we might have to admit the possibility of many time-systems, determined by particular activities. This theory of time is interesting in itself, and has obvious points of similarity to Bergson's doctrine of dur6e, which has aroused so much interest amonjg philosophers in our own day. Bergson's enemy is that " false intellectualism which immobilises moving ideas into solidified concepts to play with them as counters." By exposing the fallacy which underlies this method of thinking, he hopes that he has restored the independence of the individual and removed from the freely-aspiring human * 3, 7, 12. In 4, 4, 1, he says that all spiritual perception is timeless -'AXpovor rao-a 9' P'o-its.</page><page sequence="8">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 367 will the cold hand of determinism. He proves that the mechanical theory, which is applicable to inorganic matter and its motions, does not account for the phenomena of life, still less for those of spiritual and purposive life. Psychical facts are not measurable in terms of one another. The methods of mathe- matics (for these are the methods of mechanical science) are not applicable to living beings. We may describe the course of organic evolution, but not explain or predict it. Bergson eveii denies teleology, as being "mechanism in the reverse order"; he insists on real spontaneity and newness in the movements of organic life. But at this point some even of his disciples part company with him. If there is no invariable sequence and no inner teleology, what is left but chance? The "freedom" which he has vindicated turns out to be mere lawlessness. Science is reduced to playing with appearances, which are not even appearances of reality. Reality seems to be wild movement with nothing to move. For Bergson, according to our President, there is no unique sense in which events at different places are simultaneous. This seems to me to be destructive of the idea of time. Nor can I agree, any more than Plotinus would have agreed, that ' we are within a movement." If we were, we could not know that we were moving, and for all practical purposes we should not be moving, just as for almost all practical purposes we may think of the earth as stationary. Bergson is also deter- mined to make time a spiritual reality, while spatial dimension is only "material." The body, says Mr. Carr in a striking sentence, is continuous with an infinite present, the mind with an infinite past. But the truth surely is that space is one of the " dimensions" in which the Soul pursues its activities, and time is another.* I can see no warrant for degrading one and exalting the other. Nor can I see why the miind is continuous * So Miinsterberg says: "Things have their space-shape, but are not parts of one space; they have their time-shape, but do not lie in time."</page><page sequence="9">368 W. R. INGE. with an infinite past, but apparently not with an infinite future. The future appears to be non-existent for Bergson, though the past exists. He seems to give us an infinite snipped off at one end. Bergson's most original contribution to philosophy lies in his attempt to connect mechanical and psychical laws with our notions of Space and Time respectively. Onr experience of Time he calls la dur&amp;e, a word which has no exact equivalent in Eng,lish. The characteristic of this experience is that there is no bare repetition, and no summation of discrete moments; but the past flows on into the present, and modifies it. This interpenetration is one-sided; the future does not affect the present; therefore, he says, the process is irreversible, and Time, or la durAe, must be real. In biology, on the other hand, and in the inorganic sciences, where all so-called changes are explicable in purely quantitative terms, every series is theoretically reversible, since the later stages contain nothing which was not implicit in the earlier. If this were the true character of all changes in the universe, Time would be of no more account in philosophy than it is in mathematics, a science in which duration is wholly disregarded. " Scientific thinking," in Bergson's sense, also eliminates all qualitative estimates and all valuation. The misapplication of "scientific thinking" in this limited sense (it would be better to call it the mechanical theory) to psychical experience is largely due, Bergson thinks, to that "confusion of Space with Time" of which we have found Plotinus complaining. The characteristic of Space is that it can be subdivided indefinitely, while Time, as we experience it (though not as we measure it), cannot be counted or split up. It is like a tune which loses its existence as a tune if the notes are taken out and considered separately.* Space, for Bergson, is the mere form of homogeneity, and he differs from Plotinus in making Space prior to the objects * Lindsay, The Philosophy of Bergson, p. 124.</page><page sequence="10">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHrLOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 369 which it contains. This notion of Space is connected with what we may venture to think a very vulnerable spot in Berg,son's philosophy. He sets Space arid Time too dualistic- ally over against each other, and forgets that there can be no perception of the purely homogeneous. Qualitative difference is perceived in any spatial perception; and par revanchte, there can be no experience of pure heterogeneity; the changing is only knowni, as changing, in relation to an assumed permanent substance. Berason, like Leibniz, who calls Space " the order of co-existence," impoverishes the content of spatial experience far too much. Space is not merely the form of co-existence, which indeed can be conceived, though not pictured, noni- spatially. Space is also essentially the form under which we recognise qnear and far, and so infer the reality of the unseen and unexperienced. Time teaches the same lesson under a different form. Space and Time forbid us to shut ourselves up within ourselves. By obstinately refusing to be explained away, they refute subjective idealism. They are real over against the psychical consciousness; real, Plotinus would say, for the individual soul exercisina its normal activities. To the universal Soul they are a kind of " Matter," the field of its external activity, and they represent orderly arrangements within a whole; for Space and Time are uniform throughout, and though they may stretch out to infinity, they are essentially measurable, and therefore constituents of a whole. The soul can transcend them, because the true home of the soul is the eternal world. The soul is not really in Space and Time, though these are the field of its activities; they are rather in the soul. Timie, Change, and Causality. It is, or should be, a commonplace of philosophy, that only the permanent can change, change being a succession of states within a unity. These states together form a system, which may be called the consequence of the nature or ground in 2 A</page><page sequence="11">370 W. R. INGE. which the unity of the system consists. When these states follow each other in Time, we may speak of change within the system. Where the sequence is only logical, neither time nor change comes in. The ordinary-and the scientific- notion of efficient cause resembles that of logical "ground" only when time and change are involved; but it generally regards events as being determined, not by the whole nature of the system to which they belong, but by the events which precede them in Time. But to assert efficient causation mieans to distinguish activity and passivity in things, which in physical science seems to be an illegitimate anthropomorphism. Physical science ought to admit no individual things or definite acts. For it the whole is one thing and nature one process. Natural science is an abstract monistic philosophy. If it could overcome its prejudice against teleology, as some naturalists, such as Lamarck, have done, it would be, in Plotinian language, the psychic reflexion of the spiritual world, polarised as a world of will. While it chooses to eliminate soul, which is the only cause of change, it must consistently eliminate efficient causation. Strictly, there is no activity or passivity in things. Ordinary thought would reject as absurd the notion of an event being determined by the future; but if the whole series is one system, there is no reason why the earlier members of the series should have more efficient power than the later. Indeed, the notion of efficient causality is profoundly unsatis- factory. It ascribes activity to mere links in the chain of events, which cannot possess it, and denies activity to the system as a whole, which may possess it. Things are not vehicles of causation. Some scientific writers are aware of this; but they cling to what they call causation as a way of denying, intervention of any new factor in evolutioin; each stage, they say, is wholly conditioned by its temporal ante- cedents. Thus when they assert causality they mean to deny that there is any such thing. They assert continuity, which, as Bradley has argued, seems to be a self-contradictory</page><page sequence="12">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 371 notion, if it is intended to reconcile change and permanence. Accordingly, some have given up the philosophical problem, and limit the province of science to the discovery of the manner in which nature usually behaves. They are thus well rid of causality altogether. This is the more welcome to them, as it is plain that if all events are caused by preceding events, there can be no beginning to the series, which stretches back to infinity. But to say that natural science is "merely descriptive" is to confess that it is an abstract science, which can give us no view of reality as a whole. For description is only incomplete interpretation. For Plotinus, things certainly cannot be causes. The ground of each system is some Idea in the world of Spirit, which has been transmuted by soul into vital law. The only real causes are final causes. So-called efficient causes are parts of the machinery which soul uses. They belong to "nature." Bergson thinks that by insisting on the " individuality" of conscious life (by individuality he means that interpenetration of present by past states which he finds to be characteristic of psychical experience) he has vindicated the freedom of the will against determinism. In ordinary "scientific thinking," duration is eliminated, as is proved by the fact that if the movement of the whole time-process were greatly accelerated it would make no difference to the calculations. Science, therefore, he urges, commits us to the absurdity of change without Time. But in reality the mechanical theory denies real change, if, with Bergson, we hold that there is no real change without the intervention of some new causative factor. Alternate evolution and involution have been the predestined and predictable lot of material things from the first.* But this alternation introduces no new element into things, which therefore remain essentially unchanged. To this it may be * So Emupedocles taught long ago. 6vTLs oiU9vos EOT'V a7lavTaV OV??Cv ovU TLS oAqOe/V OavaTOLo reXet'T?), I uIXXa LovJ7' 6T re WMaXXa(s Tre utytrcov I if(Trl, qWLav T ErIl TOL oro .aCerat dvOpiro0twV. 2 A 2</page><page sequence="13">372 W. R. INGE. answered that Time may measure the peliods of each process of evolution and involution, each of which may be a teleological series. If Bergson had said that the causation of one thing by another is excluded by the mechanical hypothesis, he would have been right; and no doubt many scientists who adopt the mechanical theory are open to the charge of talking about causation when they mean only invariable sequence. Others have confused logical consequence with causality. Causation implies creative action; it is a teleological category, and belongs to the processes of nature only as determined once for all by a " First Cause," or as directed by an immanent will. It is a vulgar error to suppose that invariable sequence excludes either a First Cause or an immanent will. Invariable sequence may be a fact of observation, but it explains nothing. Winter is not the " cause " of summer, nor day of night. Post hoc ergo propter hoc is an anthropomorphism on the analogy of human purposive action. For an automatist it is absurd. Causation, used in its correct sense, is precisely what Bergson calls "creative evolution," and it does require la dutree, as he says. But this constant operation of creative force may take place without any " freedom" on the part of that which exhibits its effects. A watch is no more free when we push the hands about than when we leave it to keep its own time. Nor does Bergson even succeed in proving that a psychical series, in "real time," is irreversible. He only makes it discontinuous, whether we read it backwards or forwards, for, whenever a " new" element is admitted, there is a breach of complete continuity. Lastly, he does not prove that it is unpredictable, but only that it is unpredictable by the laws which govern inorganic matter. What he calls creative evolution may be the orderly develop- ment of psychical or spiritual law, which a superior being could predict as the astronomer predicts an eclipse. In this case, the argument for free will falls to the ground, if we take free will to mean a real "contingency in the heart of things," to use a phrase of Dr. James Ward's. Bergson rejects teleology, and</page><page sequence="14">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 373 therefore finalistic determinism, but he cannot get rid of either. If, with the Neoplatoniists, we hold that "Divine necessity coincides with Divine will," we shall infer that we win freedom in proportion as we enter into the life of God, and mlake His will our will. Our freedom will then be our emancipation from our fancied subjection to the law of sin and death. It seems more than probable that there is no radical difference between the laws which determine the sequence of events in the organic and in the inorganicworlds;* but that as we rise to the higher forms of being the laws become more and more complex, and therefore apparently irregular in their working. Human character is the most complex of all, and the most obviously ungeometrical. But only a superhuman intelligence could say whether there is any real indetermination in these manifestationis. We have rejected the notion that onie evelnt is the cause of another. The cause of any event is the will of a spiritual being, of a mind which has willed it to happen in a certain series. That will is certainly not less free if it acts uniforinly, linking events together as stages in a predetermined action. Whether that will is human or superhuman is another question. For Plotinus the will is that of the World-Soul, and individuial souls are free in pro- portion as they understand and obey the laws which the World-Soul has ordained alike for them and their environment. The World-Soul itself is the instrument of Spirit energising through it as the supreme will. The " idealistic reaction against Science" (Aliotta) has made great play with the irregularities of concrete nature, which only approximates "on the average" to the "diagrams" of science. It is argued that nature " really is" irregular and' unaccountable, the "laws of nature" being only convenient methodoloaical assumptions, indispensable for the special work * What we call mechanism is itself psychical. Nothing is given without psychical activity. To ignore this is one of Bergson's chief errors.</page><page sequence="15">374 W. R. ING. of science. Plotinus would say that the laws are certainly the world of Soul, but that nature is so too. Whatever may be the explanation of apparent disorders in nature, no Platonist can observe with glee that the world does not seem to him to be a perfect cosmos. He may need a caution against " mathematicising nature," but not against attempting to find universal law in the natural world. The synthesising labour to which, he is always impelled is no mere " symnbolism ";* it is the pathway to reality. It is thus that in the psychic world he discovers the truth of teleology, and in the spiritual world the eternal fountains of Truth, Beauty and Goodness. It may be suggested that the real object of that branch of science which deals with inor(ganic nature is to discover the inner meaning of what seemTs to us unconscious activity. This is a very different thing from drawing diagrams. Time for Plotinus is the form of willed change. Every distinict idea " yonder " becomes a finite purpose " here." Every attribute of God's essence becomes an activity of His existence. The time-process is not the necessary form of the self-evolution of God; it is the product of His free but necessary creative activity. But it is not needful to suppose that in inorganic nature God has wound up the clock and left it to itself, while in living beings new interventions take place. Rather, the same spirit which slumbers in the stone and dreams in the flower awakes in the human soul. The assumption that regularity is a sign of undirected movement is one of the strangest and most obstinate of human prejudices. It is only * Aliotta (p. 438) seems to me very sound on this point. "If we examine any principle, law, or physical concept whatever, we shall find that experience is not simply copied or abbreviated, but is rather completed, perfected, and idealised. In the scientific concept the phenomena given in perception attain to a higher degree of coherence and intelligibility than in the practical world, and hence to a higher degree of truth." The scientific concept is not a symbol; for the symbol is always worth less than the thing synmbolised, whereas the scientific concept is of greater value than the series of facts which acted as the starting-point of its formation.</page><page sequence="16">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 375 a false idea of causation that makes us think that orderly evolution is not real change. It is the same prejudice that makes men say that " God does nothing," because they cannot distinguish any particular event as an " act of God." Variation and heredity are both facts, both names for unknown laws. Why should one be more "spiritual" than the other; and why should we confound freedom with the unpredictable? We have no wish to reduce even inorganic evolution to the terms of pure mathematics. In fact, no natural process does exhibit this exactness. Nature always "wobbles" a little, as any table of vital or meteorological statistics shows. Yet irregularity is not a sign of higher or freer life. On the contrary, the precision of the mathematical sciences seemed to Plato and many of his school the very type of the spiritual order. But there is a profound truth in the saying of Proclus that only the highest and lowest things are simple, while all between is complex. Mathematical truth may perhaps be compared to an empty outline of the rich glory of the spiritual world. It is an abstract and colourless presentation of supratemporal reality. With the concrete individual there enters not only " a splitting up" (as Plotinus says) of spiritual truth, but some apparent dislocation of law- of mechanical law in the physical world, of psychical law in the soul-world. T'his dislocation seems ielatively slight in the material world, just because that world has so little life; it is more marked in the region of soul, because it is in this region that life is most fully revealed as a struggle. Still, we do not know what a mechanical psychical life wouild be; we have no scales to weigh the imponderable. Time, for Plotinus, is not merely "the measure of the impermanence of the imperfect; " it is the measure of a definite finite activity directed to some end beyond itself.t * Dr. Schiller. t ouic auir? reXeLourat, a)XXa ro Irpaypa ov0 EaroXaCTox7, 6, 1, 16.</page><page sequence="17">376 W. R. INGE. This remarkable statement proves that Plotinus regards Time as a teleological category. What is real in Time is the poten- tiality of qualitative change. " Movement by itself does not need Time." There is movement in the spiritual world, but no qualitative change. Continuous regular motion is a form of stability. Time is needed when the superior principle desires to make something "according to the pattern showed in the mount." Because this act of creation is willed, and willed as a process, there must be an interval between the inception and conclusion of the process. This interval is Time. Past and Future. In what sense are the distinctions of past and future real? Plotinus says that temporal differences "here" are images of differences in order or arrangement (7r-aet) " yonder." That is to say, what is unreal in past and future is not the relation of anteriority and posteriority, but the enivisagemenit of temporal events from an imaginary point, "the present," within the process. Anterior and posterior vents are, in their positions and not out of them, constituent parts of the individual fact to whieh they belong. Past andI future are illusory ideas. Things do not come into being, npr pass out of being; it is we who are movina through Time as the traveller in an express train sees trees and hedges hurrying:past his field of vision. Btut is this a legitimate comparison It runas counter to a deep- seated instinct, that Time and Space are not like each other. We readily grant that the " not here " is as real as the " here but it is difficult for us think of the past and futture as being no less real than the present. What is the ground of this difference? One reason may be that we can move voltunitarily in Space, but not in Time. The movement of Time carries us all with it, like the movemnent of the earth round the sun. There is also a mysterious and deeply important difference between the two tracts that lie behind and before the moment which we call the present. We are absolutely blind on one</page><page sequence="18">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 377 side. The apparent contingency and uncertainty of all that lies ahead of us seems to be the source of our ideas of cause, purpose, and freedom. If the future lay open before us, it is difficult to see how we could have these ideas, which could never arise from a contemplation of co-existence. Unless, then, our ideas of cause, purpose, and freedom are illusory, futurity must indicate something more than a blind spot in our mental vision. This ignorance must be a necessary condition of soul life. We must, however, be careful not to exaggerate the difference between our knowledge of the past and our ignorance of the future. Very much of the past is as completely lost to us as the future; and the whole would be lost but for the mysteriouis faculty of memory. What memory does for us with regard to the past, knowledge of natural law does for us with regard to the future. We do know many things that have not yet happened. Yet, if we are to take Plotinus as our guide, we must remember that the Soul is the creator of the pheno- menal world and the time-process, and that this creation is a continuous act, being the activity which constitutes the out- going life of the Soul. From this, the specifically human point of view, there is a real generic difference between the " not yet " and the "no longer," and we cannot regard them as homo- geneous parts of a landscape which we traverse as passive spectators. The will, of which Time is the form, lhas a wholly different relation to the future from that which it has to the past. In looking back, the will confesses its impotence; in looking forward it finds its scope and raison d'etre. It is because psychical reality is will, not memory, that we reg,ard the past as " done witlh." Memory, indeed, proves that our consciousness of the time-process, with its evanescenice of the past, is an illusion. It is a partial knowledge, limited by the needs of our activity. Like all else, it indicates that the Soul has " come down " on a temnporary adventure. This attitude of the will is not, lhowever, something to be merely left behind when we climb from Soul to Spirit. In the life of Spirit</page><page sequence="19">378 w. It. LNGE. Time is transcended; but the Eternity in which Spirit moves and has its being is not an arrested and fixed present moment, truncated of its living relations to past and. future; it is a fuller and richer life in which all meanings are completely expressed, all relations acknowledged. The Soul must take its Time-experience up with it to the threshold of Eternity; it will leave nothing behind as it crosses the threshold. "&lt;All things that are Yonder are also Here."* The life of the Souip in its higher aspect is a contemplation of Spirit. That is to say, all real psychical ends belong to the spiritual world. Ends are striven for in Time, but there can be no ends in Time, which swallows its own children. From the point of view of practical religion it makes a great difference whether we regard the phenomenal world as a mere polarisation of a timeless and changeless reality, or whether we hold that its being is radically teleological. The former doctrine deprives Time of all existence and all value. Philosophers of this school care nothing for history. The general tendency of Indian thought has been in this direction, in strong contrast with the Iranian and Hebrew religions, in which the revelation of God is sought from history, with which accordingly the sacred books of the Jewish people are largely occupied. It makes a great difference whether we make it our aim to understand reality or to help in making it. The religious genius, it is true, soon learns both that the truths of life can only be learned by practising them, and that, on the othier hand, "'good works " without " faith " are dead., But the caricatures of the two doctrines are very different. On one side, we have the pushing, hustling European or American man of business, immersed in irrational activities which make him no wiser and the world no better; and, on the other, the vacuous Indian contemplative, whose existence is a living death, steeped in dull torpor. Christianity has combined, * 5, 9, 13.</page><page sequence="20">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 379 without fully reconciling, the two views about Time. Yet in the countries of the West it has lost much of its idealistic element, throuah the vulgar conception of heaven as a fairy land existence in Time and Place. To this error, and not to any essential part of Christian doctrine, is to be attributed the spurious "otherworldliness" which disparages or denies the values of the world in which we live. To a similar error is also due the secularist apocalyptic which seeks encouragement and inspiration by " making heavy drafts upon the future,"* a. method fatal to real insight and just appreciation of values. In sociology, as formerly in religion, " reliance on the future has become an actual disease." The final satisfaction of human hopes within the temporal series is for ever impossible. The Platonic tradition leaned to the Indian view of exist- ence rather than to the Hebraic. Plato was consciously leading a reaction against the disintegrating tendencies of his age. His thought was decidedly more Oriental than that of Plotinus, who had Aristotle and the Stoics to keep him a good European. The view of Time as the form of the Will is certainly to be found in the Enneads, though it is less insisted on than a modern reader would desire. Metaphysically, his doctrine of Time anticipates some of the best thought of our own age, and is still highly instructive. The Soul and Consciousness. Self-consciousness belongs to the reasoning faculty. The Soul "turns to itself and knows itself and the things that belong to it." Consciousness is not primitive; it accrues (yiye'Ta&amp;). The psychic principle of life is reflected as in a mirror, in which "we see ourselves as another."t The soul knows itself truly only when it knows itself as Spirit. But the highest activity of the soul is not self-conscious" in the * Bosanquet, The Value and Destiny of the Individual, p. 291. t 1, 4, 10. 1 5, 3, 14 ; 5,8, 11.</page><page sequence="21">380 W. R. INGE. ordinary sense, though in another sense we may say that Spirit alone is selt-conscious. What we commonly mean by self-con- sciousness is awareness of ourself as an object different from the perceiving subject. This, however, is a sign that we ha-ve not yet reached our goal, which is that the seer and the seen shall be as one. Consciousness is aroused nmost sharply by what is alien and hostile, just as when the body is in health it is not conscious of its organs: " We do lnot feel ourselves nor what belongs to us." " We cannot get outside ourselves." Plotinus observes also that we do things best when we are not thinking of ourselves as doing them.* Thus, what we usually call self-consciousness is for Plotinus consciousness of externality. Wheni we "lose our soul and find it" in Spirit, we are what we contemplate, and can no longer objectify it as somethina other than the perceiving mind. So R. L. Nettleship says, "I am getting more and more convinced that being conscious of something is just not the idea or consciousness of what we say it is, but of something else. It means that we are not ourselves fully." lThis seems to me perfectly sound. Consciousness of self is in truth consciousness of a contrasted not-self, with which notwith- standing we claim kinship. Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as self-consciousness. " We cannot too strongly insist," says Professor Taylor, "that if by self-consciousness we mean a cognitive state which is its own object, there is no such thing, and it is a psychological impossibility that there should be any such thing as self-consciousness. No cognitive state ever has itself for its own object. Every cognitive state * So Raphael is said to have observed to Leonardo da Vinci: "I have noticed that when one paints one should think of nothing; everything then comes better." In some arts the automatism of the expert performer is obvious. The thoughts of the professional bowler at the moment of delivering the ball cannot be of a very complex nature. Sir Jaines Paget "remembered once hearing Mdlle. Janotha play a presto by Mendelssohn, and he counted the notes and the timne occupied. She played 5,595 notes in four minutes three seconds."</page><page sequence="22">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 381 has for its object something other than itself."* What we call self-consciousness is an experience which has its place in mental growth; it is useful for certain purposes; but it is not an ultimate state of the human spirit. In our best and most effective moments, when we really " enter into " our work, we leave it behind. But there is an experience of living-a " waking state," as Plotinus calls it-which becomes ours when we are identified with the object of our knowledge. This is the experience of pure Spirit, especially when it " turns towards the One." When we reach this state, we often doubt whether the experience is real, because the senses " protest that they have seen nothing." Of course they have not, because we are then concerned with the supersensible. Hence there is a kind of unconsciousness in the highest experiences of the soul, though we can no more doubt them than our own existence.t Plotinus distinguishes two forms of consciousness: (1) avaaoOiadit,, which is sometimes called at'a9lo-t and 'zrapaxoXovz79Ytq-the knowledge which a being has of the unity of its parts;+ (2) a'vTtXl#stq-the consciousness of the opposition of subject and object in self-consciousness. It is the prerogative of Spirit to know itself as itself; ? Soul knows itself " as another's."jl The soul, in knowing itself, knows " that there is something better than itself."S Discursive thought, the characteristic activity of the soul, contains within itself neither the material nor the fornmal nor the final conditions of its own thinking. It reasons about data supplied by sense, in order to g,ain knowledge. Its powers are directed to transcending the conditions of their own activities. It is not the presence of the subject-object relation which for Plotinus * A. E. Taylor, Elemenets of Metaphysics, p. 79. t 5, 8,11. 4 It knows 7a E'v3ov yLymo$jeva, 5, 3, 1. ? 5,3,4. 11 5, 3, 6. ? 5, 3, 4.</page><page sequence="23">382 W. R. INGE. is the sign of inherent limitations in discursive thought, but the conscious oaposition of the self and the not-elf. When the level of spiritual perception is gained, the externality of the object has wholly disappeared, though the duality which is the condition of thought remains. Discursive thought is the polarised "copy" of v&amp;,)a-c, which is at once creative and immanent activity. Discursive thought "of itself moves nothing," as Aristotle says; but &amp;Savoua is, in fact, never separated from v6i7ao at one end, and creativeness (7rot' ot') at the other. Plotinus intentionally makes vovi3 and &amp;tadvota overlap. He speaks of " reasoning Spirit, Spirit in differentia- tion and motion."* Soul, on the other hand, is "the matter of Spirit, being of spiritual form."t Soul is itself within the world of Spirit, and must of necessity be unified with it.$ Soul is ovut'a; there is no line between it and Spirit. The realm of Soul is the " world of life " ;? it is in this world that individuals live and move; Spirit is "above us."J11 That part of the Soul which remains when we have separated from it the body and its passions is " the image of Spirit." ? And yet Plotinus reminds us that even "the Soul here below," whic,h is not the Soul in its full potency, possesses true being (ovCata), and hence the wisdom, justice, and knowledge which it possesses are not mere shadows-they too are real. Indeed, if we include in "the sensible world" the Soul and all that belongs to it, there is nothing " yonder " that is not also " here below."** But the world of Soul, as we know it, is only real when it is taken as a whole. It is split up among individual * voUs XoytCd.u&amp;cos, voov eE'1 8LaOradOL IcaL KLP KVTffa VOVvS yeOKrOs. 4, 9, 5. t Poo vA,1, voot8q's ou'a. 5, 1, 3. + Ev TOE. vOiTr(5 o0ra ... et's E'ivwasa e'EtW rTOE) avayKd . 4, 4, 2. ?

The soul-world, as we know it in experience, is a world of claims and counter-claims, in which things are known as instruments for the striving individual. This is not the highest truth about the contents of this world. The pity of it is that language, which was made for the fireside and the market-place, helps to stamp this view of life on our minds, since it cannot easily express any other. Wordsworth, and other poets and prophets too, have lamented this incurable imperfection in human speech. Yet the world of souls, and of soul-making, is after all the world in which we have to live. There are " other heights in other worlds, God willing," and these are not wholly out of sight; but the world in which we profess ourselves to be only strangers and sojourners is, for the time being, our home. What has been said will make it plain that consciousness, for Greek thought, is continuous with the infra-conscious on one side and with the supra-conscious on the other. The Greeks were less interested in the gradual emergence of consciousness out of the unconscious than with the gradual emergence of order and purpose out of inertia and meaningless- ness. Soul is the immediate experience of an organic indi- vidual, from the moment when he begins to be an organic individual. This experience is conscious and self-conscious in various degrees. Its ideal perfection is such an all-embracing experience as will break down all barriers between the indi- vidual soul and universal soul-life. "The soul is potentially all things. " We are a spiritual world." This refusal to ascribe a primary importance to human consciousness, which we have found in Plotinus, is charac- teristic of almost all philosophy which is in sympathy with mysticism, and can claim much outside support. Campanella follows the Neoplatonists in holding that there is a dim knowledge in plants and even in minerals. Leibniz uses similar language; each of his monads, though impenetrable, was supposed to be a kind of microcosm, sleeping, dreaming, or</page><page sequence="25">384 W. R. INGE. awake. He insists that there are unconscious perceptions in man. Ferrier* writes: " What do we mean by the word consciousness, and upon what ground do we refuse to attribute consciousness to the animal creation ? In the first place, we mean by consciousness the notion of self, which in man generally, but by no meanis invariably, accompanies his sensations, passions, emotions, play of reason, or state of mind whatsoever. Man might easily have beenl endowed with reason without at the same tirne becoming, aware of his endowment, or blending it with the notion of himself." So Bain says " consciousness is inseparable from feeling, but not, as it appears to me, from action and thought." Lewes holds that "we often think as unconsciously as we breathe," and Maudsley that consciousness is " an incidenltal accompaniment of mind."t An elaborate attempt has lately been made, by Arthur Drews, to connect the philosophy of Plotinus with that of Hartmann, the author of Thee Philosophy of the Unconsious. This attempt seems to me to have failed completely, for the simple reason that Hartmann's system is vitiated by funda- mental inconsistencies which are certainly not to be found in Plotinus. Hartmann tries to comibine the pantheism and pessimism, which he learned from Schopenhauer, with an evolutionary optimism, which his own character prompted him to accept. But the pessimismn of Schopenhauer was the direct consequence of disillusionised egoism and hedonism. No one is likely to despair of the world who has not tried to exploit it for anti-social aims. This kind of pessimism is almost as foreign to Neoplatonism as it is to Christianity. And how is it possible to reconcile it with the optimistic teleology which finds the principle of the world in an " over-conscious clear-seeing intelligence," which is transcendent as well as * Quoted by Rickaby, First Principles, p. 344. t Rickaby, toc. cit.</page><page sequence="26">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 385 immanent, and the beneficent designs of which are opposed only by the "blind irrational will" of conscious creatures? Hartmann's attempts to bring together the discrepant sides of his theory seem to me only to demonstrate their incompatibility. At the same time, there are many of his utterances which agree with and illustrate Plotinus very well; as when he says "to know oneself as of divine nature does away with all divergence between self-will and the universal will, and with all alienation between man and God; to regard the life of one's spirit as a spark of the divine flame engenders a resolution to lead a truly divilne life; . . . we acquire the will and power to think, feel, and act as if God were in us, and to transfigure each finite task in the divine light." Such utterances belong not to a disciple of Schopenhauer, but to a moralist who wished to substitute for traditional Christianity a spiritual religion which should include the discoveries of modern science, anid especially the doctrine of evolution. Bergson has lately been studying and lecturing upon Plotinus, and there are indications that the great Neoplatonist has had some influence upon his thought. In his Huxley Lecture (1911) he identifies mind with consciousness, and almost identifies consciousness with memory. "A conscious- ness that retainied nothing of the past would be a consciousness that died and was re-born every instant-it would be no longer consciousness. Such is just the condition of matter, or at least it is just the way we represent matter when we wish to oppose it to consciousness. Leibniz defined matter-that is to say, what is not consciouisness-by calling it momentary mind, an instantaneous consciousness. And, in fact, an instantaneous consciousness is just what we call unconsciousness. All con- sciousness, then, is memory; all consciousness is a preservation and accumulation of the past in the present." But, he adds, consciousness is not only memory of the past; it is also antici- pation of the future; it is a hyphen between past and future. How far, he proceeds to ask, is consciousness traceable in 2 B</page><page sequence="27">386 W. R. INGE. nature ? It seems to us to be dependent on the possession of a brain. Yet, just as low organisms are able to digest without a stomach, so, when the nervous substance is merged in the rest of living matter, consciousness may be diffused in an attenuated form, and may exist feebly wherever there is life. The truth, however, seems to be that while consciousness-which means the capacity of choice-is in principle present in all living matter, many organisms, such as parasites and nearly all vegetables, do not use it, so that it has become dormant and atrophied. As action becomes automatic, consciousness is withdrawn from it. " Two courses are open to a simple mass of protoplasmic jelly." It may follow the path towards movement and action, which requires an increasing exercise of consciousiness, or it may prefer the humdrum existence of a placid vegetable souil. Life is something that encroaches upon inert matter, over which necessity sits enthroned. Life means indetermination-freedom. There is " a slight elasticity in matter," which gives liberty its chance. The dynamic is an "explosive," a portion of solar energy absorbed in food. Thus consciousness " takes possession of matter," and directs energy in a chosen way. So we have on one side an immense machine, subject to necessity, and on the other free consciousness. Behind this activity of consciousness there is a climbing impulse, driving organic beings " to run greater and greater risks in order to arrive at greater efficiency." Nevertheless, consciousness, which enters matter with the objects just stated, is sometimes ensnared by it. Liberty is dogged by automatism, and, except in man, is stifled by it. Matter, however, is necessary; it plays at once the role of obstacle and of stimulus, and without it no effort would be put forth. The view thus briefly sketched has some obvious affinities to the philosophy of Plotinus. But it is at bottom irrecon- cilable with it. It is based on the assumption-which under- lies all Bergson's philosophy-that caprice and eccentricity are the marks of freedom and spiritual activity. The sponta- neity of life is supposed to -show itself in motiveless diversity,</page><page sequence="28">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 387 while regularity-all that can be predicted-is a proof of thraldom to blind necessity and mnechanism. It is no wonder that superstitious supernaturalisin holds out both hands to this philosophy. Such a view is abhorrent to Platonism, since it hands over nature, not indeed to a malignant power, but to purposeless machinery, and the formative and directive agency which interferes with the regularity of its working is not the universal Soul, which for Plotinus is responsible for the whole visible universe, including those parts of it which seem to us devoid of life, but a plurality of finite spirits, who act upon the world from outside, as it were, and triumph in proportion as they can introduce the unpredictable into the prddetermined. All this is contrary to the genius of Greek philosophy, and especially of Platonism. For Plotinus, the purposefulness and relevance of the world " here below," across which Ino hard lines are drawn, are the image of the complete harmony which prevails in the eternal world. We are not driven to assig,n some phenomena to mechanism and others to miracle; Soul and, behind Soul, Spirit are at work everywhere. It follows that the teleology of the world does not depend upon the interference of finite consciousness with mechanical movements. The great dramas of organic evolution and of human history are in no sense the life-story of any individual; the actors for the most part are quite unconscious of the larger aspects of their lives. Yet these larger purposes certainly exist, and they are prior to and independent of the consciousness of the actors.* Thefoci which we call ourselves exist as separate foci only for soul-consciousness; Spirit enjoys an enriched form of consciousness not tethered to any foci, in which the contrast between externality and internality is transcended. This is like what Bergson calls cosmic conscious- ness. Plotinus is not, however, fond of the word consciousness in relation to Spirit. " Does the soul yonder remember itself ? " * Bosainquet, The Principle of Individuality and Value, p. 195. 2 B 2</page><page sequence="29">388 XV. R. INGE. he asks.* "It is not probable. He who conitemplates the spiritual world does not recall who he is, or reflect whether he is Soul or Spirit. Giving himself entirely to the contem- plation of the spiritual world, he does not return upon himself in thought; he possesses himself, but he applies himself to the spiritual and becomes the spiritual, towards which he plays the part of Matter." Self-consciousness, in a word, is another name for inattention. The suggestion may be hazarded that the chief function of self-consciousness is the formation of new habits. It seems clear that it lelongs to beings who are in course of change and development, and to times when they are not acting froin habit. It appertains to psychic life as we know it, and in the eternal world it must be raised to a higher form, widely different from our present experience.t "Spirit is what it possesses," says Plotinus.+ The Soul and the Ego. The abstract ego is a different conception from that of the Soul. It seems to imply three assumptions, all of which are disputable. The first is that there is a sharp line separating subject and object, corresponding to the uncompromising antithesis of ego and non-ego. The second is that the subject, thus sundered from the object, remains identical through time. The third is that this indiscerptible entity is in some mysterious way both myself and my property. Just as Lucretius says that men fear death because they unconsciously duplicate themselves, and stand by, in imagination, at their own crema- tion, so we are seriously concerned to know whether that * 4, 4, 21. t Royce, The World and the Individual, vol. 2, pp. 260-265, has the interesting thought that self-consciousness (= consciousness of self) depends on a series of " contrast-effects " which arise from our social life. " Never do I observe myself as a single and unambiguous fact of consciousness." + 4, 4, 4.</page><page sequence="30">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 389 precious part of our possessions, our " personality," will survive death. Plotinus will have nothing to say to the first of these assumptions. Not only do subject and object freely flow into each other on the psychic level, but on the spiritual level there are no barriers at all. To the second he would answer that the empirical self is by no means identical throughout, anid that the spiritual " idea," the " Spirit in Soul," which we are to strive to realise, is only " ours " potentially. To the third he would reply that no doubt individuality is a fact (Set eKicaTov K6KaaL ov eZtvat), but that the question whether it is my self that has its distinct place " yonder " is simply meaningless.* We have to admit that in Plotinus there are traces of a real conflict between the Orphic doctrine of individual immor- tality, and the Heracleitean doctrine that there is only osne life, whicll animates every creature durin, its transit from birth to death. The doctrine of rebirth, which rests oni the idea of souls as substantiae, does Inot agree well with the idea of the World-Soul. I anm inclined to think that Plotinus did not take the doctrine of successive reincarnations very seriously; it was for him a Platonic myth. The doctrine is important for those who hold that the soul must never cease from its creative activity in the world of space and time; butt this was not the view of Plotinus. On the other hand, the World-Soal is an essential part of his philosophy, and it is impossible to believe in a World-Soul without abating considerably the claims of the independent ego. A statement which throws much light on Plotinus' view of personality is in the form of an answer to the question, how the higher parts of the soul can possess sensation.* The * Eckhart says, "It is not my soul which is transformed after the likeness of God." t 6, 7, 6. This important section is unfortunately corrupt.

Ficinus translates " quae illic dicuntur sensibilia." Kirchhoff reads JvawuBimw, which Muller</page><page sequence="31">390 W. R. INGE. answer is that the objects of sensation exist in the spiritual world, and are there apprehended by a faculty analogous to what we call sensation. The soul here below combines and systematises the data of sensation, and thereby assimilates them to the harmony which exists in the spiritual world. " If the bodies which are here below existed also yonder, the higher Soul would perceive and apprehend them. The man of the spiritual world (o aWOpww7roo 6cKet'), the soul adapted to life there, can apprehend these things; whence also the lower man, the copy of the spiritual man, has powers (Xoryov9) which are copies of spiritual powers; and the man in the Spirit (6 Et v6o aWvpc7ros) constitutes the man who is above all men. This highest man illuminates the second man, and the second the third. The lowest man in a sense possesses the others, not that he becomes what they are, but that he is in contact with them. The man that constitutes our self is active in the third and lowest rank, but receives also something from the second, and the second receives activity from the first.* Each man's self is determined by the principle of his activity (o'rTLv gxca0o-T 1caO' &amp;vp EvepyeE), though each individual possesses all the three ranks, and possesses them not."

Plotinus answers the questioln, how the higher soul can possess aio-6tjatc, by saying that " it perceives those things which are objects of perception in the spiritual world, and as objects of perception exist in the spiritual world." He insists that vrarra EJ`rava Jcra KaKE1. The objects which the senses perceive and identify " here below " are discerned in their true nature " yonder."

Or, lastly, he may live on what is really a superhuman plane-" that of the gods and god-like men," the life of Spirit. The&amp; soul, as a microcosm, has within it the potentiality of all three lives, but it chooses which of its faculties it shall develop, and which shall remain latent. If we have to choose one kind of activity as characteristically human, and to say that our personiality as individuals resides in that sphere of activity, we must select the second grade, that of the discursive intellect;* because the merely sensuious life is infra-human, and since in the life of the Spirit we are really raised above the conditions and limitations of earthly existence, no man, while in the body, can live permanently on this level. Yet we cannot remind ourselves too often that Plotinus allows us no fixed fulcrum of self-consciousness as the centre of our world and our activities. We are potentially all things ;t our personality is what we are able to realise of the infinite wealth which our divine-human nature contains hidden in its depths. This being so, we must not lay much stress on the tripartite division of soul-life which we have just been conlsidering. It represents three stages in the ladder of existence and value, but these shade off into each other. Elsewhere he tells us that "every man is double; "+ and that even the universal Soul has its higher and lower sphere of activity. Every living thing has a vital connexion with what * See 4, 8, 18; 2, 1, 5; 5, 3, 3. For the soul, when living its own life, Sensation is its servant, Spirit is its King. But he is able to speak of Novs as pE'poS lA&amp;V, 1, 1, 13. This is the doctrine of the Christian mystics. Cf. (e.g.) The Cloud of Unknowing, ch. 8. " In the lower part of active life a man is without himself and beneath himself. In the higher part of active life and the lower part of contemplative life a man is within himself and even with himself. But in the higher part of contemplative life a man is above himself and under his God." t So Keyserling says: "Das Ich ist eine Kraft, die als solche keinen Grenzen kennt." + 8&amp;rros J.caaros, 2, 3, 9; 1. 1, 10.</page><page sequence="33">392 W. R. INGE. is above and with what is below itself, and the choice between the better and the worse is continually offered. But neither the "double" nor the "threefold" man must be interpreted as a hard and strict classification. "A man must be one," as he says himself; and ' the soul cannot be divided quanti- tatively." Even here below Soul is "undivided" (Que'pto-roY) as well as "divided," and "sees with that part by which it keeps the nature of the whole."* The whole trend of Neoplatonism is towards those philo- sophies which teach that the ego or self is not given to start with. Our nature, our personality, is in process of beirng communicated to us. The individual is a microcosm striving after unity and universality. We do not yet know ourselves; the soul feels itself to be an exile and a wanderer from God (4wyta 0OE00V Kat aXqT?nr). It is impelled by home-sickness to struggle up towards the world of Spirit, in the travail-pangs (W'Sivew) through which the new birth is effected. The great saying of Chlrist about losing one's soul in order to find it unto life eternal would have been quite acceptable to Plotinus, who would, indeed, lhave understood it better than most modern Christians. For the repudiation of the "me" and "mine" which follow from it has seldom been accepted without qualification by Christian moralists. It occupies the centre of the teaching of the JTheologia Germanica and other mystical books; but outside this school it is rare to hear divine justice (for example) treated from this point of view. Individualistic justice belongs to the " world of claims and counter-claims" which the soul must learn to leave behind. Neither God nor Nature allows such claims, and the good man does not make them for himself. It is just here that the modern exaggeration of human individuality is proving a disintegiating influence in social and national life. The ethics of militarism are as much superior to those of industrial democracy on this side as they are inferior to them in other respects. * 4, 1, 1.</page><page sequence="34">SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. 393 Does this view of the self lead logically to Nirvana? If we hold that every enharncement and expansion of the personal life makes it less personal, by spreading our experience over what was before external, and bringing the outside world into ourselves, would not the theoretical consummation of this process be complete absorption in the Absolute ? And if finite selfhood is an illusion, how are we to explain the persistence of the illusion, which indeed seems to most of us a very solid fact indeed ? And further, is it true that we are only divided from each other, by differences in our interests ? If two hearts could really " beat as one," would they lose their individuality, and perhaps therewith the possibility of love-since we do not love ourselves ? These are difficult questions, which involve the whole problem of personality, divine as well as human. Lotze held that " we have little grouind for speaking of the personality of finite beings; personality is ail ideal, which like all ideals is proper only to the infinite in its unconditioned nature, but to us is, like every other good thing, only vouchsafed under conditions, and therefore imperfectly." On the other hand, it may be urged that personality is no ideal, but only the natme for our delimitation of individual existenice. "Personality only exists because we are not pure spirits, but lhave a visible and sensible basis to our existeince, in passions, limbs, and material conditions.* Personality can only belong to one who is not everythiing,, but stands in relation to others outside himself. Such conditions cannot apply to the Deity. This contradiction illustrates very strongly the fact that personality, like morality, always strives to subvert the conditions of its ownl existence. It aspires to be all-embracing, and is potentially all-embracing; but if it could realise this aspiration, it would disappear. For a person only exits as such in relation to other persons; and yet we are not fully personal (as Lotze argues) while there are other persons over against ourselves. Plotinus says that the soul does attain * Wallace, Lectures and Essays, p. 278.</page><page sequence="35">394 SOME ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLOTINUS. complete personality "yonder," in the spiriti-al world, where individual foci are not abolished, but are each the centre of an infinite circle. And having attained this perfection, the glorified soul does not rest in its fruition, but in complete self- forgetfulness looks up with yearning eyes to the Absolute One, in whom there are no more persons. And while thus looking, it creates unceasingly in the world of Soul. The analogy between personality and morality is not accidental. Personality is above all things a quality which expresses the moral nature of man.* Or we might say that it expresses the social nature of man. We recognise ourselves as persons very largely by contrast with the other persons whonm we meet in friendship or rivalry. Thus thought first increases the illusions of separate individuality, and at last transcends them.t We begin to know ourselves by realising the stubborn externality of the not-self, and then by degrees these barriers are broken down, and we find a larger self in the extension of our knowledge and sympathy. But the truest way to regard personality is as the expression and the vehicle of a unitary purpose. The self is a teleological category. Here I may refer to Royce+ who has stated this view most excel- lently. Finally, we may say that the particularism of our experience is the cross which we have to bear, and that in the overcoming of it is the sole realisation of human happiness. Almost all unhappiness is rooted in a feeling of isolation. * Leibniz's definition is: 'Persona est cuius aliqua voluntas est, seu cuius datur cogitatio, affectus, voluptas, dolor." This is perhaps to identify personality too closely with consciousness. t This point is argued admirably by Carveth Read, Natural and Social Mforals, p. xvii sq. t Royce, The World and the Individual, vol. 2 p. 286.</page></plain_text>
