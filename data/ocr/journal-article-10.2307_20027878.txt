<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gerald Holton Einsteins Third Paradise Gerald Holton is Mallinckrodt Research Professor of Physics and Research Professor of History of Science at Harvard University. A Fellow of the American Academy since 1956, he served the Academy for several decades in a variety of of fices. Soon after his election as Editor, he founded "D dalus" as the quarterly journal of the Acade my, with its first issue appearing in the winter of 1958. At the request of the Albert Einstein estate, he initiated and for several years supervised the conversion of the collection of Einstein s largely unpublished correspondence and manuscripts into an archive suitable for scholarly study. Among his recent books are "Einstein, History, and Other Passions" (2000), "Physics, the Human Adven ture" (with S. G. Brush, 2001), and "Ivory Bridges: Connecting Science and Society" (with G. Sonnert, 2002). .Historians of modern science have good reason to be grateful to Paul Arthur Schilpp, professor of philosophy and Methodist clergyman but better known as the editor of a series of volumes on "Living Philosophers," which included several volumes on scientist-philoso phers. His motto was : "The asking of questions about a philosopher's mean ing while he is alive." And to his ever lasting credit, he persuaded Albert Ein stein to do what he had resisted all his years : to sit down to write, in 1946 at age sixty-seven, an extensive autobiography - forty-five pages long in print. To be sure, Einstein excluded there most of what he called "the merely per sonal." But on the very first page he shared a memory that will guide us to the main conclusion of this essay. He wrote that when still very young, he had searched for an escape from the seemingly hopeless and demoralizing chase after one's desires and strivings. That escape offered itself first in reli gion. Although brought up as the son of "entirely irreligious (Jewish) parents," through the teaching in his Catholic pri mary school, mixed with his private in struction in elements of the Jewish reli gion, Einstein found within himself a "deep religiosity" - indeed, "the reli gious paradise of youth." The accuracy of this memorable expe rience is documented in other sources, including the biographical account of Einstein's sister, Maja. There she makes a plausible extrapolation: that Einstein's "religious feeling" found expression in later years in his deep interest and ac tions to ameliorate the difficulties to which fellow Jews were being subjected, actions ranging from his fights against anti-Semitism to his embrace of Zionism (in the hope, as he put it in one of his ? 2003 by Gerald Holton 26 D dalus Fall 2003</page><page sequence="2">speeches [April 20,1935], that it would include a "peaceable and friendly coop eration with the Arab people"). As we shall see, Maja's extrapolation of the reach of her brother's early religious feelings might well have gone much fur ther. 1 he primacy of young Albert's First Paradise came to an abrupt end. As he put it early in his "Autobiographical Notes," through reading popular science books he came to doubt the stories of the Bible. Thus he passed first through what he colorfully described as a "posi tively fanatic indulgence in free think ing."1 But then he found new enchant ments. First, at age twelve, he read a lit tle book on Euclidean plane geometry - he called it "holy," a veritable "Wun der." Then, still as a boy, he became en tranced by the contemplation of that huge external, extra-personal world of science, which presented itself to him "like a great, eternal riddle." To that study one could devote oneself, finding thereby "inner freedom and security." He believed that choosing the "road to this Paradise," although quite antitheti cal to the first one and less alluring, did prove itself trustworthy. Indeed, by age sixteen, he had his father declare him to the authorities as "without confession," and for the rest of his life he tried to dis sociate himself from organized religious activities and associations, inventing his own form of religiousness, just as he was creating his own physics. These two realms appeared to him eventually not as separate as numerous biographers would suggest. On the con trary, my task here is to demonstrate that at the heart of Einstein's mature identity there developed a fusion of his First and his Second Paradise - into a Third Paradise, where the meaning of a life of brilliant scientific activity drew on the remnants of his fervent first feelings of youthful religiosity. jTor this purpose, we shall have to make what may seem like an excursus, but one that will in the end throw light on his overwhelming passion, throughout his scientific and personal life, to bring about the joining of these and other seemingly incommensurate aspects, whether in nature or society. In 1918 he gave a glimpse of it in a speech ("Prinzipi en der Forschung") honoring the sixtieth birthday of his friend and colleague Max Planck, to whose rather metaphysical conception about the purpose of science Einstein had drifted while moving away from the quite opposite, positivistic one of an early intellectual mentor, Ernst Mach. As Einstein put it in that speech, the search for one "simplified and lucid image of the world" not only was the supreme task for a scientist, but also cor responded to a psychological need: to flee from personal, everyday life, with all its dreary disappointments, and escape into the world of objective perception and thought. Into the formation of such a world picture the scientist could place the "center of gravity of his emotional life [Gef?hlsleben]." And in a sentence with special significance, he added that persevering on the most difficult scien tific problems requires "a state of feeling [Gef?hlszustand] similar to that of a reli gious person or a lover." X hroughout Einstein's writings, one can watch him searching for that world picture, for a comprehensive Weltan schauung, one yielding a total conception that, as he put it, would include every empirical fact (Gesamtheit der Erfahrungs tatsachen) - not only of physical science, but also of life. Einstein s Third Paradise i All translations from the original German are this author's, where necessary. D dalus Fall 2003 l'y</page><page sequence="3">Gerald Holton on science Einstein was of course not alone in this pursuit. The German literature of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries contained a seemingly obses sive flood of books and essays on the oneness of the world picture. They in cluded writings by both Ernst Mach and Max Planck, and, for good measure, a 1912 general manifesto appealing to scholars in all fields of knowledge to combine their efforts in order to "bring forth a comprehensive Weltanschauung." The thirty-four signatories included Ernst Mach, Sigmund Freud, Ferdinand T?nnies, David Hubert, Jacques Loeb - and the then still little-known Albert Einstein. But while for most others this cultural ly profound longing for unity - already embedded in the philosophical and liter ary works they all had studied - was mostly the subject of an occasional op portunity for exhortation (nothing came of the manifesto), for Einstein it was different, a constant preoccupation re sponding to a persistent, deeply felt in tellectual and psychological need. This fact can be most simply illustrat ed in Einstein's scientific writings. As a first example, I turn to one of my favor ite manuscripts in his archive. It is a lengthy manuscript in his handwriting, of around 1920, titled, in translation, "Fundamental Ideas and Methods of Relativity." It contains the passage in which Einstein revealed what in his words was "the happiest thought of my life [dergluecklichste Gedanke meines Lebens]" - a thought experiment that came to him in 1907 : nothing less than the definition of the equivalence princi ple, later developed in his general rela tivity theory. It occurred to Einstein - thinking first of all in visual terms, as was usual for him - that if a man were falling from the roof of his house and tried to let anything drop, it would only move alongside him, thus indicating the equivalence of acceleration and gravity. In Einstein's words, "the acceleration of free fall with respect to the material is therefore a mighty argument that the postulate of relativity is to be extended to coordinate systems that move non uniformly relative to one another_" For the present purpose I want to draw attention to another passage in that manuscript. His essay begins in a largely impersonal, pedagogic tone, similar to that of his first popular book on relativi ty, published in 1917. But in a surprising way, in the section titled "General Rel ativity Theory," Einstein suddenly switches to a personal account. He re ports that in the construction of the spe cial theory, the "thought concerning the Faraday [experiment] on electromagnet ic induction played for me a leading role." He then describes that old experi ment, in words similar to the first para graph of his 1905 relativity paper, con centrating on the well-known fact, dis covered by Faraday in 1831, that the in duced current is the same whether it is the coil or the magnet that is in motion relative to the other, whereas the "theo retical interpretation of the phenome non in these two cases is quite differ ent." While other physicists, for many decades, had been quite satisfied with that difference, here Einstein reveals a central preoccupation at the depth of his soul : "The thought that one is dealing here with two fundamentally different cases was for me unbearable [war mir unertraeglich]. The difference between these two cases could not be a real differ ence _The phenomenon of the electro magnetic induction forced me to postu late the (special) relativity principle." _L/et us step back for a moment to con template that word "unbearable." It is reinforced by a passage in Einstein's 28 D dalus Fall 2003</page><page sequence="4">"Autobiographical Notes" : "By and by I despaired [verzweifelteich] of discovering the true laws by means of constructive efforts based on known facts. The longer and the more despairingly I tried, the more I came to the conviction that only the discovery of a universal formal prin ciple could lead us to assured results." He might have added that the same pos tulational method had already been pio neered in their main works by two of his heroes, Euclid and Newton. Other physicists, for example Bohr and Heisenberg, also reported that at times they were brought to despair in their research. Still other scientists were evidently even brought to suicide by such disappointment. For researchers fiercely engaged at the very frontier, the psychological stakes can be enormous. Einstein was able to resolve his discom fort by turning, as he did in his 1905 rela tivity paper, to the postulation of two for mal principles (the principle of relativity throughout physics, and the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo), and adopting such postulation as one of his tools of thought. JC/instein also had a second method to bridge the unbearable differences in a theory : generalizing it, so that the appar ently differently grounded phenomena are revealed to be coming from the same base. We know from a letter to Max von Laue of January 17,1952, found in the archive, that Einstein's early concern with the physics of fluctuation phenom ena was the common root of his three great papers of 1905, on such different topics as the quantum property of light, Brownian movement, and relativity. But even earlier, in a letter of April 14,1901, to his school friend Marcel Grossmann, Einstein had revealed his generalizing approach to physics while working on his very first published paper, on capil larity. There he tried to bring together in one theory the opposing behaviors of bodies : moving upward when a liquid is in a capillary tube, but downward when the liquid is released freely. In that letter, he spelled out his interpenetrating emo tional and scientific needs in one sen tence : "It is a wonderful feeling [ein herr liches Gef?hl] to recognize the unity of a complex of appearances which, to direct sense experiences, appear to be quite separate things." The postulation of universal formal principles, and the discovery among phenomena of a unity, of Einheitlichkeit, through the generalization of the basic theory - those were two of Einstein's favorite weapons,2 as his letters and manuscripts show. Writing to Willem de Sitter on November 4,1916, he con fessed: "I am driven by my need to gen eralize [mein Verallgemeinerungsbeduerf nis]." That need, that compulsion, was also deeply entrenched in German cul ture and resonated with, and supported, Einstein's approach. Let me just note in passing that while still a student at the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, in order to get his certificate to be a high school science teacher, Einstein took optional courses on Immanuel Kant and Goethe, whose central works he had studied since his teenage years. That Verallgemeinerungsbeduerfnis was clearly a driving force behind Einstein's career trajectory. Thus he generalized from old experimental results, like Fara day's, to arrive at special relativity, in which he unified space and time, electric and magnetic forces, energy and mass, and so resolved the whole long dispute Einstein s Third Paradise 2 A third was his use of freely adopted (non Kantian) categories, or thematic presupposi tions. The prominent ones include unity or unification ; logical parsimony and necessity ; symmetry ; simplicity ; causality ; completeness of explanation ; continuum ; and, of course, constancy and invariance. D dalus Fall 2003 29</page><page sequence="5">Gerald Holton on science among scientists between adherence to a mechanistic versus an electromagnetic world picture. Then he generalized the special theory to produce what he first significantly called, in an article of 1913, not the general but the generalized relativity theory. Paul Ehrenfest wrote him in puz zlement : "How far will this Verallge meinerung go on?" And, finally, Einstein threw himself into the attempt of a grand unification of quantum physics and of gravity : a unified field theory. It is an example of an intense and perhaps unique, life-long, tenacious dedication, despite Einstein's failure at the very end - which nevertheless, as a program, set the stage for the ambition of some of today's best scientists, who have taken over that search for the Holy Grail of physics - a theory of everything. ^o much for trying to get a glimpse of the mind of Einstein as scientist. But at this point, for anyone who has studied this man's work and life in detail, a new thought urges itself forward. As in his science, Einstein also lived under the compulsion to unify - in his politics, in his social ideals, even in his everyday behavior. He abhorred all nationalisms, and called himself, even while in Berlin during World War I, a European. Later he supported the One World movement, dreamed of a unified supernational form of government, helped to initiate the in ternational Pugwash movement of sci entists during the Cold War, and was as ready to befriend visiting high school students as the Queen of the Belgians. His instinctive penchant for democracy and dislike of hierarchy and class differ ences must have cost him greatly in the early days, as when he addressed his chief professor at the Swiss Polytechnic Institute, on whose recommendation his entrance to any academic career would depend, not by any title, but simply as "Herr Weber." And at the other end of the spectrum, in his essay on ethics, Ein stein cited Moses, Jesus, and Buddha as equally valid prophets. No boundaries, no barriers ; none in life, as there are none in nature. Ein stein's life and his work were so mutual ly resonant that we recognize both to have been carried on together in the service of one grand project - the fusion into one coherency. 1 here were also no boundaries or barri ers between Einstein's scientific and reli gious feelings. After having passed from the youthful first, religious paradise into his second, immensely productive scien tific one, he found in his middle years a fusion of those two motivations - his Third Paradise. We had a hint of this development in his remark in 1918, where he observed the parallel states of feeling of the scien tist and of the "religious person." Other hints come from the countless, well known quotations in which Einstein referred to God - doing it so often that Niels Bohr had to chide him. Karl Pop per remarked that in conversations with Einstein, "I learned nothing_he tend ed to express things in theological terms, and this was often the only way to argue with him. I found it finally quite uninter esting." But two other reports may point to the more profound layer of Einstein's deep est convictions. One is his remark to one of his assistants, Ernst Straus : "What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world." The second is Einstein's reply to a curi ous telegram. In 1929, Boston's Cardinal O'Connell branded Einstein's theory of relativity as "befogged speculation producing uni versal doubt about God and His Cre ation," and as implying "the ghastly 30 D dalus Fall 2003</page><page sequence="6">apparition of atheism." In alarm, New York's Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein asked Einstein by telegram : "Do you believe in God? Stop. Answer paid 50 words." In his response, for which Einstein needed but twenty-five (German) words, he stated his beliefs succinctly: "I believe in Spinoza's God, Who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind." The rabbi cited this as evidence that Einstein was not an atheist, and further declared that "Einstein's theory, if carried to its logical conclusion, would bring to man kind a scientific formula for monothe ism." Einstein wisely remained silent on that point. The good rabbi might have had in mind the writings of the Religion of Sci ence movement, which had flourished in Germany under the distinguished aus pices of Ernst Haeckel, Wilhelm Ost wald, and their circle (the Monisten bund), and also in America, chiefly in Paul Carus's books and journals, such as The Open Court, which carried the words "Devoted to the Religion of Science" on its masthead. JLf Einstein had read Carus's book, The Religion of Science (1893), he may have agreed with one sentence in it: "Scien tific truth is not profane, it is sacred." Indeed, the charismatic view of science in the lives of some scientists has been the subject of much scholarly study, for example in Joseph Ben-David's Scientific Growth (1991), and earlier in Robert K. Merton's magisterial book of 1938, Sci ence, Technology and Society in Seventeenth Century England. In the section entitled "The Integration of Religion and Sci ence," Merton notes that among the sci entists he studied, "the religious ethic, considered as a social force, so conse crated science as to make it a highly re spected and laudable focus of attention." The social scientist Bernard H. Gustin elaborated on this perception, writing that science at the highest level is charis matic because scientists devoted to such tasks are "thought to come into contact with what is essential in the universe." I believe this is precisely why so many who knew little about Einstein's scien tific writing flocked to catch a glimpse of him and to this day feel somehow uplift ed by contemplating his iconic image. Starting in the late 1920s, Einstein be came more and more serious about clari fying the relationship between his tran scendental and his scientific impulses. He wrote several essays on religiosity; five of them, composed between 1930 and the early 1950s, are reproduced in his book Ideas and Opinions. In those chapters we can watch the result of a struggle that had its origins in his school years, as he developed, or rather invent ed, a religion that offered a union with science. In the evolution of religion, he re marked, there were three developmental stages. At the first, "with primitive man it is above all fear that evokes religious notions. This 'religion of fear'... is in an important degree stabilized by the for mation of a special priestly caste" that colludes with secular authority to take advantage of it for its own interest. The next step - "admirably illustrated in the Jewish scriptures" - was a moral religion embodying the ethical imperative, "a development [that] continued in the New Testament. " Yet it had a fatal flaw : "the anthropomorphic character of the concept of God," easy to grasp by "underdeveloped minds" of the masses while freeing them of responsibility. This flaw disappears at Einstein's third, mature stage of religion, to which he believed mankind is now reaching Einstein s Third Paradise D dalus Fall 2003 31</page><page sequence="7">Gerald Holton on science and which the great spirits (he names Democritus, St. Francis of Assisi, and Spinoza) had already attained - namely, the "cosmic religious feeling" that sheds all anthropomorphic elements. In de scribing the driving motivation toward that final, highest stage, Einstein uses the same ideas, even some of the same phrases, with which he had celebrated first his religious and then his scientific paradise : "The individual feels the futili ty of human desires, and aims at the sub limity and marvelous order which reveal themselves both in nature and in the world of thought." "Individual existence impresses him as a sort of prison, and he wants to experience the universe as a single, significant whole." Of course! Here as always, there has to be the intox icating experience of unification. And so Einstein goes on, "I maintain that the cosmic religious feeling is the strongest and noblest motive for scientific re search _A contemporary has said not unjustly that in this materialistic age of ours the serious scientific workers are the only profoundly religious people." In another of his essays on religion, Einstein points to a plausible source for his specific formulations : "Those indi viduals to whom we owe the great cre ative achievements of science were all of them imbued with a truly religious conviction that this universe of ours is something perfect, and susceptible through the rational striving for knowl edge. If this conviction had not been a strongly emotional one, and if those searching for knowledge had not been inspired by Spinoza's amor dei intellectu alis, they would hardly have been capa ble of that untiring devotion which alone enables man to attain his greatest achievements." ? believe we can guess at the first time Einstein read Baruch Spinoza's Ethics (Ethica Ordinae Geom?trico Dem?nstrala), a system constructed on the Euclidean model of deductions from propositions. Soon after getting his first real job at the patent office, Einstein joined with two friends to form a discussion circle, meet ing once or twice a week in what they called, with gallows humor, the Akade mie Olympia. We know the list of books they read and discussed. High among them, reportedly at Einstein's sugges tion, was Spinoza's Ethics, which he read afterwards several times more. Even when his sister Maja joined him in Princeton in later life and was confined to bed by an illness, he thought that reading a good book to her would help, and chose Spinoza's Ethics for that pur pose. By that time Spinoza's work and life had long been important to Einstein. He had written an introduction to a biogra phy of Spinoza (by his son-in-law, Rud olf Kayser, 1946) ; he had contributed to the Spinoza Dictionary (1951) ; he had re ferred to Spinoza in many of his letters ; and he had even composed a poem in Spinoza's honor. He admired Spinoza for his independence of mind, his deter ministic philosophical outlook, his skep ticism about organized religion and or thodoxy - which had resulted in his ex communication from his synagogue in 1656 - and even for his ascetic prefer ence, which compelled him to remain in poverty and solitude to live in a sort of spiritual ecstasy, instead of accepting a professorship at the University of Hei delberg. Originally neglected, Spinoza's Ethics, published only posthumously, profoundly influenced other thinkers, such as Friedrich Schlegel, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Goethe (who called him "our common saint"), Albert Schweit zer, and Romain Rolland (who, on read ing Ethics, confessed, "I deciphered not what he said, but what he meant to say"). 32 D dalus Fall 2003</page><page sequence="8">For Spinoza, God and nature were one (deus sive natura). True religion was based not on dogma but on a feeling for the ra tionality and the unity underlying all finite and temporal things, on a feeling of wonder and awe that generates the idea of God, but a God which lacks any an thropomorphic conception. As Spinoza wrote in Proposition 15 in Ethics, he op posed assigning to God "body and soul and being subject to passions." Hence, "God is incorporeal" - as had been said by others, from Maimonides on, to whom God was knowable indirectly through His creation, through nature. In other pages of Ethics, Einstein could read Spinoza's opposition to the idea of cos mic purpose, and that he favored the pri macy of the law of cause and effect - an all-pervasive determinism that governs nature and life - rather than "playing at dice," in Einstein's famous remark. And as if he were merely paraphrasing Spin oza, Einstein wrote in 1929 that the per ception in the universe of "profound rea son and beauty constitute true religiosi ty ; in this sense, and in this sense alone, I am a deeply religious man." IVJLuch has been written about the re sponse of Einstein's contemporaries to his Spinozistic cosmic religion. For example, the physicist Arnold Sommer feld recorded in Schilpp's volume that he often felt "that Einstein stands in a par ticularly intimate relation to the God of Spinoza." But what finally most interests us here is to what degree Einstein, hav ing reached his Third Paradise, in which his yearnings for science and religion are joined, may even have found in his own research in physics fruitful ideas emerg ing from that union. In fact there are at least some tantalizing parallels between passages in Spinoza's Ethics and Ein stein's publications in cosmology - par allels that the physicist and philosopher Max Jammer, in his book Einstein and Religion (1999), considers as amounting to intimate connections. For example, in Part I of Ethics ("Concerning God"), Proposition 29 begins : "In nature there is nothing contingent, but all things are determined from the necessity of the divine nature to exist and act in a certain manner." Here is at least a discernible overlap with Einstein's tenacious devo tion to determinism and strict causality at the fundamental level, despite all the proofs from quantum mechanics of the reign of probabilism, at least in the sub atomic realm. There are other such parallels through out. But what is considered by some as the most telling relationship between Spinoza's Propositions and Einstein's physics comes from passages such as Corollary 2 of Proposition 20 : "It follows that God is immutable or, which is the same thing, all His attributes are immu table." In a letter of September 3,1915, to Else (his cousin and later his wife), Ein stein, having read Spinoza's Ethics again, wrote, "I think the Ethics will have a per manent effect on me." Two years later, when he expanded his general relativity to include "cosmologi cal considerations," Einstein found to his dismay that his system of equations did "not allow the hypothesis of a spa tially closed-ness of the world [raeum liche Geschlossenheit]. " How did Einstein cure this flaw? By something he had done very rarely: making an ad hoc addi tion, purely for convenience : "We can add, on the left side of the field equation a - for the time being - unknown uni versal constant, - X." In fact, it seems that not much harm is done thereby. It does not change the covariance; it still corresponds with the observation of motions in the solar system ("as long as X is small"), and so forth. Moreover, the proposed new universal constant X also Einstein 's Third Paradise D dalus Fall 2003 33</page><page sequence="9">Gerald Holton on science determines the average density of the universe with which it can remain in equilibrium, and provides the radius and volume of a presumed spherical universe. Altogether a beautiful, immutable uni verse - one an immutable God could be identified with. But in 1922, Alexander Friedmann showed that the equations of general relativity did allow expansion or contraction. And in 1929 Edwin Hubble found by astronomical observations the fact that the universe does expand. Thus Einstein - at least according to the physi cist George Gamow - remarked that "in serting X was the biggest blunder of my life." Max Jammer and the physicist John Wheeler, both of whom knew Einstein, traced his unusual ad hoc insertion of X, nailing down that "spatially closed-ness of the world," to a relationship between Einstein's thoughts and Spinoza's Prop ositions. They also pointed to another possible reason for it: In Spinoza's writ ings, one finds the concept that God would not have made an empty world. But in an expanding universe, in the infinity of time, the density of matter would be diluted to zero in the limit. Space itself would disappear, since, as Einstein put it in 1952, "On the basis of the general theory of relativity... space as opposed to 'what fills space'... had no separate existence." Jtjven if all of these suggestive indica tions of an intellectual, emotional, and perhaps even spiritual resonance be tween Einstein's and Spinoza's writings were left entirely aside, there still remains Einstein's attachment to his "cosmic religion." That was the end point of his own troublesome pilgrimage in religiosity - from his early vision of his First Paradise, through his disillu sionments, to his dedication to find fun damental unity within natural science, and at last to his recognition of science as the devotion, in his words, of "a deeply religious unbeliever" - his final embrace of seeming incommensurables in his Third Paradise. 34 D dalus Fall 2003</page></plain_text>
