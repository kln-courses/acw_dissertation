<plain_text><page sequence="1">The North Carolina Historical Review Volume XXII July, 1945 Numbek 3 WHITE UNTO HARVEST1 By Hubert McNeill Pote at We may be very sure that there are in North Carolina many solid, substantial citizens who when they note in their newspapers the announcement of the annual meeting of the State Literary and Historical Association will be moved to satirical reflection and utterance. They will remark with fine scorn that the highbrows are at it again, that the professors have escaped from their cages, that the lobby of the Sir Walter is sizzling with four dollar words, that Fayetteville Street is no place for ordinary folks, that there's an exhibit of bald domes in Raleigh, that Wake County air seems unusually stuffy, that such a gathering entails a scandalous waste of time and money, and so forth and so forth and so forth. The wretched professor, indeed, has long been a particular and favorite target of editors, cartoonists, and wags. He is habitually presented as a sort of vague and ineffectual booby, wandering abstractedly about, with glasses perched pre cariously on the end of his nose and a mortarboard teetering on his head ; or as an absent-minded and wholly unrealistic imbecile, utterly unconcerned with actual life; or as a sort of wretched mole, burrowing about in his musty books and never coming up into the light of day. His title, too, is often an object of mirth—only partly because it has been borrowed by astrologers, ventriloquists, and performers upon the xylophone. Whether we like to do so or not, we may as well admit frankly that this sarcasm, directed at us as an Association or as indi vidual professors and devotees of culture, is not without founda tion. I therefore choose to depart this evening from the mos maiorum—the precedent set by my predecessors—and to address you very practically, on the subject, "White Unto Harvest." 1 Presidential address delivered at the annual session of the State Literary and Historical Association of North Carolina, Raleigh, December 7, 1944. [ 263 ]</page><page sequence="2">264 The North Carolina Historical Review A year ago, when you did me the high honor of electing me to the presidency of this Association, the distinguished editor of The News and Observer graciously invited me to make that journal the organ of the Association. I thanked him, period; there was nothing further I could do. During the year I have suggested to our able secretary and to the members of the execu tive committee that in my opinion this Association and its affili ated societies ought to exert a more active and positive influence upon the life of our great state ; that we should not content our selves with an annual meeting, no matter how learned or bril liant the papers presented for our edification may be; that it is high time for us to descend from the remote and inaccessible Everests of our alleged intellectual aristocracy, that we may walk the streets and the byways and minister to the needs of men. In 44 B.C. Marcus Tullius Cicero published his essay On the Nature of the Gods. In the introduction he writes thus : "If any body would like to know what consideration impelled me to liter ary tasks of this sort so late in life, I can explain the matter to him with the greatest ease. ... I decided that for the good of the state, philosophy ought to be presented to our citizens, for I felt that the honor and reputation of our city were vitally con cerned in having matters at once so important and so stimulating set forth in the Latin language." Late in the same year he published his De Officiis, character ized by Frederick the Great as "the finest work on morals which ever has been or ever can be written," and recently described by President Butler as "the best textbook for the statesman of to day and tomorrow." I quote a striking passage : "Let us agree, therefore, that those duties which arise out of fellowship are in more intimate accord with nature than those that owe their origin to cognition. This can be proved as follows : if it should fall to the lot of the wise man to live, in affluence, a life of leis urely contemplation of things thoroughly worthy of his pains taking consideration, but if, meanwhile, he were absolutely de nied the society of his fellow men, he would perish. . . . That wisdom, then, which I have called the highest wisdom is the knowledge of things human and divine, in which is included</page><page sequence="3">White Unto Harvest 265 the apprehension of the fellowship of gods and men and the ties which unite man to man. If these ties are strong, and their strength cannot be questioned, then those duties which spring from fellowship must be loftiest of all. For the contempla tion and comprehension óf nature, if one's life be destitute of action, is, as it were, defective and inchoate. Now the fairest consummation of action is attained in the bringing of happiness to mankind; it is therefore vitally connected with the bonds of fellowship which unite the human race. Ergo, communitas must be placed on a higher level than cognitio. Every good man be lieves this and proves his belief by his deeds. For there is nobody so strenuously occupied in the investigation and observation of nature but that, in the midst of his reflections upon matters in the highest degree worthy of his thoughtful attention, if tidings were suddenly brought him of some impending national disaster, or of the need or danger of a relative or a friend, he would put down and cast from him all those intellectual exercises, even though he fancied he was numbering the stars or calculating the magnitude of the universe." But, say some of us in reply to Cicero, we love the gracious domains of art and literature, of music and history and philoso phy, and we would walk therein undisturbed by the howling world and its demands ; we would slake our thirst at quiet, brim ming fountains, for we believe with Keats that "Beauty is truth, truth beauty,"-that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know ; we find the ways of men filled with unseemly din and strife, and our spirits are disquieted within us ; we much prefer the lovely gardens where the great minds of all the ages pour out their treasures upon us and we are at peace. So, precisely, said the Epicureans—whom Cicero heartily despised for their categorical and dogmatic egocentrism, their ataraxia—complete and utter freedom from care and worry and from the importunate claims of altruism and patriotism alike. Those erudite pundits who write fat books on the history of philosophy are fond of setting Epicureans against Stoics, like two opposing football lines, usually to the great advantage of the Stoics. But whereas the Epicureans, strangely enough, displayed genuine missionary zeal in the propagation of their system, the</page><page sequence="4">266 The North Carolina Historical Review Stoics were content to discuss virtue, the supremacy of the will, obedience to the inner voice, within their own learned societies, with little or no interest in Fayetteville Street. Thus all their eloquent diatribes against slavery got the slaves exactly nowhere, for, following time-honored philosophical precedent, they began at the top and stayed at the top. Compare that procedure with the method of the Man of Nazareth who went straight to the oppressed, exploited dregs and pariahs of humanity with the sublime doctrine of the brotherhood of man. We need not won der that, as St. Mark tells us, "the common people heard him gladly." Moreover, His example and His teaching are still, after the passage of the long centuries, the hope and inspiration of our wretched, war-racked world, while Zeno and Chrysippus and Cleanthes and Epicurus are names in textbooks. Well, here we are in this pleasant room. We have come from homes of culture, blessed with carefully chosen libraries; from college and university campuses, where we revel in stimulating intellectual fellowship; from the secluded sanctum of the his torian, the poet, the novelist, the playwright, the philosopher, where Pallas Athene, Apollo, and the Muses speak softly and persuasively to our eager ears. Presently we shall return to our ivory (or Gothic) towers, grateful for the blessing of com munion with kindred spirits, and happily immerse ourselves once more in nirvana—like the gods in Tennyson's Lucretius, who dwell in The lucid interspace of world and world, Where never creeps a cloud, or moves a wind, Nor ever falls the least white star of snow, Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans, Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar Their sacred, everlasting calm ! Pray do not misunderstand me : I revere as profoundly as you those towering souls who have forsaken the joys of human society in their utter devotion to scientific research; to their sacrifices at the fragrant altars of literary and artistic inspira tion ; to patient, self-obliterating meditation upon the high mys teries that lie beyond the reach of our human vision. I am trying to say to you that we who know and love these giants who, in Lucretius's great phrase, have ranged "far beyond the flaming</page><page sequence="5">White Unto Hakvest 267 bastions of the universe," must acknowledge and strive more fully to discharge the inescapable obligation that is ours to medi ate to our less fortunate brothers and sisters the priceless treas ures which have stirred and warmed, inspired and guided our own minds and hearts. If greed is the fundamental sin, then selfishness, its blood brother, wallows hard by. "He who lives only to benefit himself," writes Tertullian, "confers on the world a benefit when he dies." The day of the ivory tower is no more, if, indeed, it ever was, save in the imagination of men and women who out of vanity, indifference, sloth, or sheer aversion consider themselves so far above hoi polloi as to be perfectly content to sit like sculptured Buddhas in splendid—and tragic—isolation, grandly undisturbed when the man in the street feeds his soul on husks, confuses (in Hugo's words) the constellations of profundity with the stars which the duck's feet make in the soft mud of the pond, gulps the lethal pills of demagogy, or prostrates himself in worship be fore a horrid anthropomorphic monster. There are three fields especially in which I believe our influ ence, as individuals and as an Association, ought of right to be felt mightily—public taste, politics, education. I shall speak with utter conviction, but not, as Cicero once wrote of a certain philo sophical bigot, as if I had just descended from a council of the gods. The good old Latin maxim, De gustibus non est disputandum, is perfectly familiar to me. I am not suggesting that we should dispute about the tastes of our fellow citizens, but that we should patiently and tactfully avail ourselves of every possible oppor tunity of improving, elevating, and refining them. The great American game is neither football nor bridge; it is the highly lucrative sport of feeding the great public what it wants or can be beguiled and cajoled into thinking it wants. For example, I never fully comprehended Isaiah's words, ". . . precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, and there a little," until the manufacturers of tab lets, salves, lotions, pills, and other such truck took to the air waves. The endless and exasperating reiteration of their sup posedly alluring patter is a frank and disturbing indication of</page><page sequence="6">268 The North Carolina Historical Review their estimate of the intelligence of American citizens. And the programs whch are so unceremoniously and so frequently inter rupted by silky-voiced apes (in Nell Battle Lewis's precisely de scriptive words), caroling, "Buy our medicine; you'll be glad you did," and the like drivel—the programs, I say, are in large measure pitched on the same level and addressed to the same fifth-grade mentality—skilful build-up by the announcer, syn thetic applause, and all the rest of the shoddy devices with which we are all, to our sorrow, only too familiar. The accursed saxophone, illegitimate progeny of the clarinet and the trombone, came out of Germany, as did many another evil thing; it is surely one of the grimmest of all the ironies of fate that its inventor, one Saxe, died in abject poverty and was buried in the potter's field. But when the saxophones moan and the music gets sweet or hot, as the case may be, we behold female adolescents of all ages squealing and swooning, we stare in amazement at the appalling antics of rug-cutters and jitterbugs and hepcats, we contemplate sadly the devastating carnage wrought upon infantile humanity when the crooners begin to moo and bleat, and we wonder whether life is really worth living. It will surprise most of you, and I sincerely hope it will shock all of you, to learn that the love of God, the life and crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, the glories of Heaven, and other such subjects, are being widely dealt with on exactly the same plane. If you don't believe me, listen some Saturday evening to a pair of whining hillbillies, gargling, to the accompaniment of a guitar, "Tune in on JESUS, the only radio station that's never off the air," hearken to the stamping of feet, the whistling, the yelling that follow the rendition of the blasphemous rubbish, and give thanks that the longsuifering of the Deity is infinite. Public taste in the matter of periodical literature may well be examined for a moment. You have seen the popular and pulp magazine statistics—and in all conscience they are dishearten ing and disturbing. If catering at the lower levels is the great American game, then boredom is unquestionably the great Ameri can malady. H. L. Mencken, indeed, goes so far as to say that the "basic fact about human existence is not that it is a tragedy, but that it is a bore." It was Matthew Arnold, I believe, who</page><page sequence="7">White Unto Harvest 269 defined culture as "the ability to perceive and the capacity to enjoy what is excellent." If that fine statement is true, then boredom, like any other weed, springs from unfilled, neglected soil. He who in the morning of life has failed to establish the habit of feeding his soul with good things will go through the whole of his little day with boredom clinging to him like an evil spirit from the realms of nether darkness, and his energies will be devoted chiefly to a frenzied search for something—anything —that will kill time. Horace, wise and gentle observer of men, asks pertinently, "What exile from his native land has ever succeeded in escaping from himself?" Seneca echoes the Hora tian inquiry: "You wish to know why your flight helps you not a whit? Because you take yourself along." Even Emerson once packed his trunk and sailed to Naples, only to discover that there beside him was "the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from." Now one of the most highly favored avenues of refuge from boredom leads straight to cheap reading matter. Every month millions of copies of magazines that present "true" stories are sold, and I am told that most of the readers who gulp the sorry trash so avidly actually believe that the stories are true. Vica rious excitement and vicarious thrills thus help to fill dull hours with a pathetic, specious glow of happiness. For the same reason there is an enormous market for those pictorial journals which record in palpitating detail the goatish capers of the morons of Hollywood. Too long, ladies and gentlemen, far too long, have we sipped the nectar of the gods in our ivory towers, sublimely indifferent to the fact that the vast majority of our fellow men are content edly guzzling swill and garbage. The time has come for us to admit, sorrowfully but frankly, that part of the blame is ours and to begin to discharge the obligation which our love of the best and finest achievements of humanity lays upon us in escapably—the obligation to be channels through which these blessings may reach "the wilderness and the solitary place," so that "the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose." In the second place, I suggest to you that the members of this Association ought to make their influence felt in the field of</page><page sequence="8">270 The North Carolina Historical Review politics and government. Once upon a time there was a certain tinpot tyrant named Benito Mussolini ; his most famous recorded dictum was to the effect that the people haven't sense enough to govern themselves. In order to introduce some measure of truth into the statement, let us rewrite it thus: "At times the people act as though they lacked sufficient intelligence to govern themselves." For example, at the polls, where with tragic fre quency they elect to office tub-thumping alley cats, slick peddlers of economic tripe, cavorting vaudeville clowns, and downright crooks and criminals. And why? Simply because great num bers of our fellow citizens have never taken the trouble to cul tivate the fine art of doing their own thinking and thus fall an easy prey to every faker who appears with his wares and his patter. Once upon a time there was a Roman emperor who drove all the philosophers out of the capital city. There can be no doubt, I think, that the principal reason for this piece of highhanded cruelty was that Domitian knew that the chief business of phi losophers was to teach men to think, and he no more wanted to live in an atmosphere of independent intelligence than does Adolph Schickelgruber today. I wish some member of this Association would write a book on "The Peril of the Plausible." Time and again in the history of our country the people have gone a-whooping after some per suasive rascal, adept in all the tricks of the great American game, referred to above, who was selling gold bricks so artfully put together as to defy detection by any save the keenest eyes— isolationism, for example. Well, we need more keen eyes look ing level and steadfast out of keen, trained minds which habitu ally do their own thinking. No matter what subject you teach in your classroom, my professorial brethren and sisters, your great task, your magnificent opportunity, your heaven-blessed duty is to train the boys and girls before you to think straight. Woodrow Wilson once asked a Princeton student a tough ques tion. The lad replied hesitantly, "Well, er, professor, I think. .. ." "Thank God !" said Wilson. One further point, please, in the political field. That grand old romancer Livy has reminded us that the primary reason for the study of history is that we may learn how other men and na</page><page sequence="9">"White Unto Haevest 271 tions dealt with their problems and solved their difficulties and thus may see our own way more clearly. Polybius deemed the Roman republic to be almost a perfect realization of Aristotle's ideal commonwealth; certainly it was one of the most remark able of all man's achievements in democracy; yet, it gradually slipped into oligarchy, then stumbled and fell into anarchy, and finally plunged into its grave, mainly because the citizens had lost interest in it. Cicero, writing to a friend during the tense and terrible opening days of the civil war between Caesar and Pom pey, remarks that he has been moving about the country, talking to the farmers and to the people in the small towns ; they care not a whit, he discovers, which of the two great political gladia tors wins, so long as they, their fields, their little homes, and their miserable bank accounts are unmolested. A hundred sixty years later the greatest of all the world's satirists, Juvenal, snarls sardonically that Romans are interested in only two things: food and amusement. Now history has the disquieting habit of repeating itself. We Americans have a firm foundation for our faith in the future of our mighty Union ; but if that faith ever opens the door to com placency and indifference, no man can tell how soon our republic, too, will pass into the shadows. I am not urging that we abandon our cultural pursuits and rush into the political arena; I am insisting that our country has every right to expect and indeed to demand that you and I shall take an alert and intelligent in terest in public affairs ourselves and, so far as in us lies, strive to impress indelibly upon the rising generation, in home and school, an unshakable conviction that this nation will remain great and free only so long as its citizens are ready, willing, and equipped to contribute each his share to its unfolding glory. In conclusion, I invite your attention to some problems pre sented by contemporary educational ideas and practices. During the past few years the Progressive Educators have emitted such a vast volume of noise that even the most secluded recluse must be aware that they have taken over American grammar school and high school education, lock, stock, and barrel. In his address at the opening of Columbia University on September 27, Presi dent Butler dealt vigorously with their tenets and their pseudo</page><page sequence="10">272 The North Carolina Historical Review scientific monkeyshines. "We face," said he, "an extraordinary situation due to that most reactionary [italics, mine] philosophy. " How any such preposterous doctrine ever received a hearing by intellectual minds is difficult to understand, but its effects are evident in the reports of undisciplined youth. This plan of action or rather non-action would . . . first of all deprive the child of his intellectual, social and spiritual inheritance and put him back in the Garden of Eden to begin all over again the life of civilized man. He must be asked to do nothing which he does not like to do. He must be taught nothing which he does not choose to learn. He must not be subject to discipline in good manners and sound morals. In other words, he must be let alone to do what he likes in this amazing twentieth century in order that what has been called his individuality may grow naturally and without guidance or discipline." No clearer statement, ladies and gentlemen, of the fatuous folly of progressivism could possibly be made. The fundamental racial virtue on which the greatness of Rome was securely founded was pietas, which means primarily obedi ence to law. The progressives will have none of it. In a certain school in New York City recently a bright little lass tripped into her classroom one fine morning and said, "Please, teacher, do we have to do what we want to do today?" An instructor in one of our army camps—a man who was decorated for bravery in the First World War—made a few weeks ago this statement: "I had a fine time until the new 18-19-year-old draftees came along. My life is now in constant danger. . . . These boys have never had 'No' said to them. They have never been made to obey an order." Precisely. And so the average boy or girl of today steps out of the high school with only two permanent posses sions—the habit of superficiality akd an astounding ability to dodge difficulties. The most brilliant piece of satire I have read in a long time comes from the gifted pen of Dr. Edgar W. Knight and was published in the April 1 issue of School and Society. I recom mend it to you, ladies and gentlemen. Knight deals devastat ingly with those holy progressive shibboleths, "the integration of personality" and "the co-ordination of experiences"; pours a</page><page sequence="11">White Unto Harvest 273 * withering fire upon the contempt of the progressives for such antiquated subject-matter courses as grammar, spelling, and mathematics; and rakes mercilessly their everlasting and gen erally silly experimentation. Incidentally, Dr. Thomas H. Briggs once told me that he had published an offer of a prize of fifty dollars to anybody who would give him a sensible definition of the integration of personality; Dr. Briggs added that he still held the prize money. One of the more interesting results of the progressive theory and practice is that the government finds it necessary to spend many millions of dollars for the training of young soldiers and sailors and airmen in fundamentals which should have been acquired in school and which were not acquired because the wretched little boys had to have their experiences co-ordinated and their personalities integrated, and so there simply wasn't time for the three R's. Since September, 1942, no foreign language, ancient or mod ern, has been required for graduation from North Carolina high schools. In days such as these that fact is surely amazing enough in itself ; but the explanation offered by a member of our State Department of Public Instruction is almost beyond belief. He is reported to have said : "Foreign languages are the chief cause of failure among high school students ; they are therefore too diffi cult for our boys and girls and will henceforth be omitted from the requirements for graduation." That statement goes straight down the progressive line: make the pathway smooth and easy for young feet; never require any child to study a subject which he finds either dull or difficult; let him "express himself" by choosing what he will do and what he will not do ; let there be no law for anybody. Small wonder the terrifying increase of juve nile delinquency haunts our dreams at night. One further point, please : our current system of grammar and high school education lives and breathes on tests and measure ments, surveys and projects, graphs and curves, charts and sta tistics. Now all these elaborate and mystical devices for the utter confusion of the judicious not only consume a vast deal of time and effort and a staggering amount of money ; they also implant in the mind of youth a profound and disturbing respect for pen</page><page sequence="12">274 The North Carolina Historical Review cil, ruled paper, and percentage table. Moreover, during the past twenty years there has been a heavy emphasis laid upon science, at all educational levels. Our boys and girls have learned the importance of analysis and synthesis, of exact verification, of detailed reports on observations, of irrefutable proof. Thus the study of real science, which has produced so many magnifi cent results, has united with constant exposure to pseudo science to develop and foster in young people a conviction that nothing is real, nothing desirable, nothing even tolerable, which cannot be presented in a graph, examined through a microscope, and duly described and classified, or subjected to the scrutiny and evaluation of the mathematician or the chemist or the physi cist. In other words, the young men and women of today are quite apt to shrug their shoulders at goodness as a vague and nebulous will-o'-the-wisp ; to regard morality as a purely relative matter, dependent upon too many environmental and hereditary considerations to be of genuine importance; and to sneer at ideals as so much transcendental buncombe. They are ready to believe in the presence of proof, but they are losing faith—the willingness to accept as true the unprov able (and Tennyson has reminded us that nothing really worth proving can ever be proved), the inner perception of unseen realities, the "deep-lying capacity to apprehend the eternal world and to respond to its appeal." Surely one of the sublimest concepts that ever took form in a human brain was Plato's doctrine of ideas. Material things which are grasped by the senses, said that mighty philosopher, are neither real nor permanent ; the only realities are qualities which speak to the mind and soul—love, mercy, justice, beauty, truth; thoughts are greater than things—which are only "the shadows of ideas thrown upon the screen of experience." St. Paul restates this grand concept thus : "For the things which are seen are tem poral ; but the things which are not seen are eternal." Our young people need to ponder a blazing passage in the second chapter of Zechariah : "I lifted up mine eyes again and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what</page><page sequence="13">White Unto Harvest 275 is the length thereof. And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as a city without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein: For I, saith the Lord, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her." In other words, you can't measure Jerusalem. No, and neither can you compress George Washington into a chemical formula, or weigh Abraham Lincoln, or compute Robert E. Lee, or put Martin Luther into a test tube, or set up an equation for Jesus of Nazareth. I say to you again, ladies and gentlemen, the day of the ivory tower has passed. Come ye out into the ways of men, bearing your precious gifts of culture and intelligence, courage and faith. "Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already unto harvest."</page></plain_text>
