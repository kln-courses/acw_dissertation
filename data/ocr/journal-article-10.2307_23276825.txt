<plain_text><page sequence="1">exhibition review Vaudou April 5-September 25, 2011 Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain Paris, France reviewed by Cécile Fromont The "Vaudou" exhibition that opened in the Spring of 2011 at the Fondation Cartier in Paris presented African art connoisseurs and regulars of the contemporary exhibition space with an exciting, unusual, and yet surprisingly familiar setting for a show of African mate rial. The formal architectural features of the foundation, and in particular the tall glass wall enclosing unwieldy vegetation and separat ing the art space from the street, welcomed visitors to what seemed like an intimate ver sion of the Quai Branly. The exhibition was simply entitled "Vaudou," the French spell ing of the word vodun, a reference to the reli gion and philosophy of the Fon people of todays Republic of Benin. The one-word title equivocally evoked not only the African phe nomenon, but also related yet distinct New World religions such as Haitian vodou or New Orleans voodoo. If the French name did not carry the negative connotations linked to the latter word's vernacular use in English, the title of the English language edition of the catalogue, Vodun: African Voodoo, seemed particularly fraught with these ambiguities, ostensibly applying the negative associations of the American word to the African religion. Jacques Kerchache, the controversial French art dealer who field collected all of the pieces in the exhibition, conceived of the show before his death in 2001, but it is the foundation's curator Leanne Sacramone, in collaboration with Kerchache's widow, who saw the proj ect to completion. Three different exhibitions overlapped in "Vaudou": a thrilling reunion of around one hundred Fon figures, Enzo Maris masterful feat of Italian design (Fig. 1), and a tribute to the late collector. The collector, dealer, and self-made Kerch ache initiated passionate debates around the nature and place of non-Western visual pro duction in contemporary France that culmi nated in the dismantlement of the museum and research center of the Musée de l'Homme, the closing of the Musée des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie at the Porte Dorée, the inaugura tion of the Louvre's Pavillon des Sessions, and the construction of the Musée du Quai Branly. Kerchache, working closely with then Presi dent Jacques Chirac, stood at the center of what would become a radical redefinition of France's public discourse on non-Western cul tures, as recently explored in Sally Price's 2007 book Paris Primitive. The financial and politi cal magnitude of these events immediately erupted into heated debate and controversy in scholarly, museum, and political circles in the years preceding and following the 2006 open ing of the Quai Branly. The rapid, top-down, and contentious reorganization of these insti tutions will, however, continue to impact the nature and form of public and scholarly dis cussions about France's identity as a postcolo nial, multicultural society. From the street, viewers entered the airy indoor/outdoor open space of the foundation's ground floor to face a flight of stairs descend ing into darkness. A text on the wall facing the steps greeted them with the words of Jacques Kerchache. The quote stressed that their eyes were all they needed to grasp the spectacle they were about to experience. Downstairs, in a large dim room, the collector's radical bias for aes thetics over context materialized in Enzo Maris spectacular scenography (Fig. 2). Forty-eight black display cases with a single bo (pi. bocio) in each, brought the power figures to eye level. Bocio are visually bold assemblages of potent materials, bound to a zoomorphic, anthropo morphic, or abstract core in an empowering process of creation that provided Fon people with protection and catharsis in the face of danger and misfortune. The exhibition space was starkly dark but each bo was expertly lit to showcase the intricacies of its textured patina. 1 A night view of the exhibition room of "Vaudou" on the ground floor showcases Enzo Mari's dramatic lighting.

The experience was intimate and demanding on viewers. The clear cases protect ing the figures did not create much of a barrier between the spectators and the sometimes dis quieting bocio, whose animal bones, bindings, and sacrificial blood easily seized the imagina tion of the mostly Western viewers. In this dra matic, temple-like staging visitors lowered their voices and moved methodically from one case to the next. To the side of this main space, another room showcased several smaller pieces in a classic museum case, as well as the large instal lation Chariot de la Mort (Chariot of Death) (Fig. 3). The latter consisted of two crocodile skulls chained to a large anthropomorphic figure as horses to a cart. The ensemble floated over a pool of still water, an arrangement imagined by Kerchache himself, and an able literal translation of one of the definitions of the word vodun as "rest to draw the water," an admonition to be calm and composed rather than rush through life (Blier 1995:39). Back on the ground floor, to the left of that uninviting dark staircase, a brightly lit and airy grouping of figures drew visitors to an adjacent room. There, they found mock white washed house façades arranged in a semi vol. 45, no. 3 autumn 2012 alrlcan arts 89 Vaudou April 5-September 25, 2011 Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain Paris, France reviewed by Cécile Fromont 1 A night view of the exhibition room of "Vaudou" on the ground floor showcases Enzo Mari's dramatic lighting.

In front of each houses closed door stood a large, weath ered anthropomorphic wooden figure, with minimal additive material (Fig. 1). As visi tors entered the open space, they encountered a smaller bo on a stand in the center, whose tongue was tied to a chain weighed down by a heavy stone, another vodun allegory of the importance of circumspection. To the side, on a wide stand, a line of smaller pieces stood in front of the buildings glass wall, against the pale green vegetation of the garden outside (Fig. 4). In keeping with the concept of the exhibition, this rooms displays were totally undisturbed by texts or wall labels. On the right of the ground floor, glass walls, light wood seats, and display cases focused on Kerchache himself. Interviews and field videos projected on a large screen. Autographs, cor respondence between Kerchache and eminent French political figures concerning his proj ect to include "primitive art" in the Louvre, and original field photographs celebrated the collector/dealers life work on the tenth anni versary of his death (Fig. 5). The exhibition catalogue as well as reference books on vodun were available to visitors on a long table. Enzo Mari's breathtaking design and instal lation created a provocative paragone between contemporary Western aesthetics and the bocio. The minimalism that defines his work stood in sharp contrast to the accumulation characteristic of the Fon figures. If on the one hand, the scenography showcased the bocio beautifully, it also drew attention away from the African objects themselves, which looked displaced and restrained in their stark, geo metric encasements. The exhibition clearly took a strong stand in the inextricable conun drum of the display of non-Western visual production in Western settings. The absence of labels, except for a leaflet available to the most enterprising visitors, and the use of minimal istic, equally sized cases for objects of different size, purpose, and use, unabashedly gave pri macy to Western rather than Fon aesthetics. In the process of presenting bocio as art in the Western sense, visitors gained a sense of inti macy and personal rapport with the objects but lost the opportunity to comprehend, even imperfectly, the intricacies of their cumula tive, collective, and profoundly philosophical nature. Although in their original setting bocio performed their functions partly through visual means, in a way that may translate well across cultures, their awesome powers also derived from culturally specific aesthetic con siderations and from the social context of their creation. The exhibition deliberately obscured these matters. The show's accompanying press releases, websites, and video material presented a more nuanced approach. While some voices anchored the minimalistic presentation of the Fon figures in a discourse of universal ism, others focused on the significance of the objects for the Fon. The main rationale for the exhibition remained that bocio can surpass their original context and strike the minds and imaginations of Western viewers. Yet I would argue that the familiar sense of awe Westerners experience in the presence of vodun may be less a proof of its universal appeal than a testament to centuries of shared histories between Africa and what would become the West.

Visitors would come, revel in the shocking visual impact of the figures, and exit, awed, cer tainly, but unchallenged in their knowledge of Fon aesthetics, religion, or philosophy.

Imported objects such as padlocks and coins conspicuously lent their power to bocio, and, in turn, the awe-inspiring African fig ures have shaped Western imagination and imagery since the invention of the notion of fetish on the West African coast in the sev enteenth century (Pietz 1985,1987,1988). In this respect, the objects in the show may have provided their Parisian public with more of a space of self-reflection than a window to another culture.

Eicher Bloomington: Indiana Univer sity Press, 2010. 248 pages, 71 color illustrations, bibliography $27.95, paper reviewed by Barbara Plankensteiner This volume assembles a variety of articles by known scholars specializing in African tex tiles, dress culture, and fashion. Targeted to a larger audience of scholarly readers not essen tially acquainted with the latest research in the field of African fashion, it aims to be an introduction to the diversity of fashion in Sub Saharan Africa and the African diasporas. Per tinent to this objective, it doesn't offer much new insight to specialists in the field but rather synthesizes the multifaceted perspectives and themes in the recent research. Divided in three thematic parts, the volume includes thirteen articles and an introduction by the two editors, who each also contribute a chapter. There is no reference bibliography but a list of suggested readings relating to each chapter. The book is beautifully designed and features high-quality photographs illustrating the various topics addressed. The chapters are kept to a comfortable length, which makes the volume also a suitable tool for teaching. In the introduction Suzanne Gott and Kristyne Loughran delineate the framework that guided their approach. Alluding to earlier key publications that illuminate African dress practices and their complex sociocultural sig nificance or present African fashion design ers, they follow an expanded notion of African fashion that encompasses dress or clothing culture as well as high fashion. They assert that African fashion is not a phenomenon of the recent past, but that constant change has determined clothing trends throughout his tory, a fact clearly reflected in several chapters of the book. The collection of essays further gives credit to the complexity of production of African fashion ranging from small workshops of seamstresses to renowned fashion designers acting on the international scene. Both fashion worlds are interconnected from a conceptual vol. 45, no. 3 autumn 2012 airicanarts 91 4 Two Fon figures stand in front of a glass wall with the Fondation Cartier's gardens in the background. 5 Interviews and field videos of Kerchache played in a large screening room, to the side of the exhibi tion itself.
