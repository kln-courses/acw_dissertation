Made in the remote mountainous region of Lampung in southern Sumatra, it dates from no earlier than the nineteenth century. Yet it is as ancient in its tradition as it is modern in date, for its functional and iconographical roots belong to the Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures surviving for over 2,500 years in isolated parts of Indonesia. The tapis consists of two ikat-dyed cloths joined along their selvage edges and then embroidered. Before being worn, it would be sewn into a tube. Deep indigo blue bands embroidered with anthropomorphs in cream, pale blue, and golden brown silk are set against ikat bands ornamented with angular geomet ric designs in soft earthen tones. These are separated by thin stripes of mustard yellow, dark indigo blue, and reddish brown over which is embroidered a delicate zigzag design. In some tapis, the ikat bands are replaced by alternating brown and yel - low stripes, and sometimes the wide embroidered bands repre sent ships bearing trees, people, and occasionally houses instead of anthropomorphs (Figure 2). Tapis such as these, made in the interior of Lampung, are very different from those made along the coast where they are heavily embroidered with imported gold thread or covered with small mirror pieces. 2 Coastal tapis are worn with a silk shoulder cloth, a gilded belt, and strings of gold coins; unmarried girls wear, in addition, gold headdresses made in the shape of a ship (Figure 3). Along the west coast, the Kauer women wear tapis with richly embroidered jackets.3 In spite of the strong regional differences among the tapis of Lampung, they are all distinguished from sa rongs made throughout the rest of Indonesia by their use of em broidery as a prominent element of the design. Tapis, moreover, differ from embroidery done elsewhere in Sumatra because their embroidered designs belong to the indigenous tribal culture of Lampung even though the technique itself was imported into Su matra through overseas trade.4 Unfortunately, little is known about the use of tapis in the in terior of Lampung. Along the coastal areas, tapis were worn at elaborate feasts of merit associated with life-crisis rituals, those ceremonies designed to help a person make the transition from one stage of life to another - e.g., birth, marriage, death. And even today, the wealthy still wear them at marriage ceremonies.5 In the mountainous interior of Lampung where this tapis was made, however, feasts of merit apparently did not play such a prominent role.6 Presumably, tapis were worn for life-crisis cer emonies here as well, but specific field observations and records are lacking.7 An enormous amount of work and time went into making sarongs such as this tapis. The first step in the process consists of picking and cleaning the cotton and then spinning it into thread.8 Spinning had to be done during the dry season since cot ton cannot be readily spun in damp weather. Next, the threads for the warp would be carefully measured out on a warping frame, after which the ikat process began. Warp ikat is a tech nique of patterning in which the warp threads are dyed to the de sired pattern before the cloth is woven. This is done by tightly wrapping with a dye-resistant material, usually palm leaf strips, the portions of the warp threads to be left undyed by a given color. As the warps are submerged in one color after another, the resists are changed according to the requirements of the pattern. When the dyeing process is completed, all resists are removed, the warps are carefully arranged on the loom, and the cloth is woven. The warping and wrapping of the warp threads as well as the gathering of plant materials needed to make the dyes would be carried out during the rainy season. Weaving, like spinning, must be done during the dry season which means that approx imately one year was required to complete all stages of an ikat. For tapis, the bands of delicate embroidery would then be ap plied after the two panels required for each sarong had been joined along their selvage edges. Figure 2. Tapis.

The fluid, delicate embroidered designs so precisely and evenly stitched are full of movement and vitality, in contrast to the embroidered bands of some tapis in which these motifs have become somewhat frozen and lifeless.9 As for the bands of ikat, their precision and intricate detail are extra ordinary, particularly considering the nature of the ikat tech nique in which the smaller the details of the design, the more minute the resists, and considering also that any carelessness in wrapping the resist materials results in blurred or fuzzy contours. Looking at the ordered, geometric, angular designs of the ikat bands juxtaposed with the fluid, curvilinear, spontaneous de signs of the embroidered bands, one is struck by their obvious contrast and, at the same time, by the stunning beauty of the combined effect. Scholars believe that the two contrasting de signs belong to different ornamental traditions. 0 The rhythmic, geometric figures of the ikat bands are part and parcel of a long tradition of warp ikat weaving in Indonesia. They occur in many variations among the ikats of isolated peoples, particularly those of Borneo and Celebes, where outside contacts and trade have been minimal and where tribal cultures have remained ex tremely primitive even to the present day. l The geometric figures bear an astonishing resemblance to those appearing in abun dance in Chinese decorative art as early as the Shang and Late Chou periods (Figure 4). And, indeed, it has been suggested that these ornamental motifs may be among the elements of the Bronze Age culture of Indonesia persisting to the present day.12 Existing evidence indicates that the Bronze Age culture was brought to Indonesia from China, Tonkin, and North Annam ? ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ , by merchants, craftsmen, and small groups of settlers (as op posed to large-scale migrations) during the second half of the first millennium BC. '3 These voyagers, belonging to the Dong son and the Late Chou cultures, infused a dynamic ornamental style into the indigenous, Neolithic art of Indonesia. Meanders, hooks, rhombs, and tangent circles were among the decorative motifs assimilated into the existing iconography of frontal hu man figures, animals, and Trees of Life. 14 Many relics of this Bronze Age culture have been found in different parts of the ar chipelago: for example, the "Moon of Bali," the largest and most magnificent of the great bronze drums found in Southeast Asia was uncovered at Pedjang in Bali; another bronze drum was found in Lampung itself; and potsherds with incised Bronze Age designs have turned up in west central Celebes, bronze socketed celts in west Java, and bronze axes in Roti. 5 In the remote interior regions of Indonesia, particularly among the Batak and Minangkabau tribes of Sumatra, the Sa'dan Torajas of Celebes, the Dayak tribes of Borneo, and the Ngada peoples of Flores, elements of Dongson and Late Chou cultures persist in remarkably pure form. 6 Bronze kettle drums, for example, are still used on Alor Island north of Timor. 7 In Borneo, the Dayak play a type of mouth organ that can be recog nized on bronze drums from the Dongson culture. This instru ment apparently had a wide distribution at one time as it appears in the Javanese reliefs of Borobudur dating from the eighth cen tury AD. 18 In Sumatra, the Karo Batak put the remains of their Figure 3.

Unfortunate ly, however, this cannot be proved conclusively because no exist ing tapis predate the nineteenth century enabling us to trace the ikat designs back through centuries of weaving in Sumatra. In sharp contrast to the beautifully muted tones of the ikat bands, with their symmetric and precise structure, are the curv ing, watery forms of the embroidered bands worked in cream, pale blue, and brown silks. Here, no rhythm of geometrically or dered space prevails but a fluidity of forms that often defies iden tification - forms mysterious and suggestive. Their abstraction probably is a direct result of untold generations of copying over centuries of time. But in their insubstantiality, they take on a mysterious, almost primordial quality that inspires such adjec tives as watery, squid-like, and amoeboid.22 A 7MA 305</page><page sequence="5">Figure 6.

Reportedly, the embroidery designs for tapis were presented by a man to his prospective bride, which suggests that these de signs may have been inspired by crafts specifically done by men in contrast to the ikat patterns belonging to the weaving tradi tions of women. 23 Similarly, some scholars have suggested that the embroidery designs were derived from paintings on wood, bamboo, or metal, because of the similarity of effect between them and the embroidered motifs filled with satin stitch and then outlined with silk of a contrasting color. 24 Particularly compel ling, however, is the resemblance of the broad, smoothly embroi dered forms that stand out against aground filled with curving tendril-like elements to certain wood carvings found among the remote tribes of Borneo and particularly Sumatra (cf. Figures 6 and 8). These carvings, in turn, bear a distinct similarity to Late Shang and Chou relief decoration (Figure 7), which raises the question whether the embroidered designs of tapis do not also have their roots in the Bronze Age culture of Indonesia.2 5 This is indeed conceivable considering the Bronze Age ele ments that have been recognized in the embroidery of the closely related tapis in which ships replace the abstract anthropomorphs in the wide embroidered bands (Figures 2, 9, and 10).26 The high bows and sterns of many of these ships, sometimes represented as birds' beaks, as well as the feathered costumes of some of the figures are similar to paintings of ships done by the Dayak of Borneo.27 These, in turn, have been shown to be direct descend ants of ship designs ornamenting the friezes of Dongson bronze drums (Figure 5). The Dayak paintings on wood made in con nection with funeral rites, depict the Ship of the Dead; presum ably the Dongson friezes of ships also represented this theme. In the embroidery of the Museum's tapis, further evidence of Bronze Age influence can be observed in the sequence of tangent spirals that forms a thin band concealing the joined selvage edges. This ornament, among the most common decorative mo tifs found on Dongson drums (Figure 5), vases, and buckles, oc curs as well on Chinese objects of the late Chou culture (Figure 7).28 Persisting into the present century, tangent spirals are most often found in the decoration of artifacts produced by remote and still primitive tribes.29 The "amoeboid" forms in the wide bands of tapis may derive from human figures.30 Although some of these forms on the Museum's tapis are beyond recognition, the one on the right end of the upper wide band, if turned vertically, does appear to have arms, legs, and two headdresses: one of ox horns and one of feathers (Figure 8). These are more easily recognized when com pared to similar figures represented in tapis embroidered with ships (Figures 2 and 9).

The practice of headhunting goes back to the Neolithic culture of In donesia that predated the Bronze Age culture and survived in some of its forms into the twentieth century.33 The additional headgear worn by the same anthropomorph consists of feathers radiating from the head. In maritime scenes embroidered on other tapis, the same headdress is depicted as part of what may be a ritual costume (Figure 2). Adjacent to this figure on the Museum's tapis appears another anthropomorph wearing a bird headdress which becomes recognizable when compared to a less abstract figure with a similar headdress from a tapis embroi dered with ships (Figures 9 and 10).34 The meaning of these embroidered images juxtaposed with the ordered geometric ikat bands is no longer understood, for as has already been noted, there is no field documentation record ing the use or significance of tapis in the interior of Lampung. Still, there can be no question that tapis were not mere festive dresses, but ceremonial garments imbued with meaning and sacredness. Field observations and research on other isolated Indonesian tribes reveal that weaving in general, and warp ikat weaving in particular, was a sacred act performed only by women.3 5 The association of spinning and weaving with women is universally encountered in primitive and ancient cultures, not only in Asia but also in the West. The archetype of the Great Mother, personified in goddesses and represented in microcos mic form in all women, spins the thread of fate and weaves the web of life.36 As early as the Rig Veda of India, dating from about 1500-1000 BC, the cosmos is viewed as a woven fabric, the regular rhythm of the interwoven warp and weft signifying the inherent order of the phenomenal world. 37 Weaving, moreover, was analogous to child bearing for, as Erich Neumann has pointed out, "The crossing of threads is the symbol of sexual union... and the crossing of the sexes is the basic form in which the Archetypal Feminine 'weaves' life."3 8 In the primitive Indonesian scheme of things textiles were closely associated with headhunting and fertility- weaving and childbearing being the feminine counterpart to the masculine occupation of headhunting.39 The latter was considered essen tial to the maintenance of cosmic order and to the continuance of fertility because life and regeneration depend of necessity on death and sacrifice.40 The close association between weaving, headhunting, and fertility is demonstrated, for example, in Bor neo where heads brought back from a headhunting expedition were ceremoniously received by women and placed in a large ikat cloth called a pua. Ceremonies performed at the time of the rice harvest closely paralleled those of headhunting and also includ ed the use of a pua.4 On the island of Timor, a mother making her first appearance following the birth of a child dressed up as a headhunter in ikat cloths and a horned headdress otherwise worn by men during ceremonies that followed the taking of heads.42 Everywhere, woven textiles - particularly ikats - were con sidered to possess magical properties of protection, fertility, and health, and were an essential part of the ritual life of tribal peoples.43 Even the patterns of woven textiles and sometimes en tire garments as well were thought to originate from the world of spirits and gods. According to the mythology of Borneo, for example, the Iban woman's skirt, the man's jacket, and the pua were all given to humans by the gods.44 Through dreams, gods or spirits communicated patterns to be woven into Iban clothes, and indeed, the weaving of some types of sacred cloths is never attempted by Iban women without supernatural encourage ment received in a dream.45 Similar cosmic and supernatural properties were undoubted ly also ascribed to woven textiles by the primitive tribes in habiting the inaccessible interior of Lampung. Although the specific mythological and ritual expressions these concepts took in the culture of those tribal peoples remain unknown, tapis were no doubt regarded to a certain extent as sacred and were an in dispensable part of ritual regalia. Because (with a few isolated and rare exceptions) the climate of Indonesia has destroyed all traces of its rich textile production predating the nineteenth century, tapis such as the Museum's are the last and only surviving representatives of a long tradition. By the end of the nineteenth century, the culture supporting that tradition had largely vanished in the interior of Lampung and with it the making and use of tapis in that region. No longer part of the ritual life of the tribal peoples, these cloths were preserved as valued heirlooms by the families who still owned them. But over time the cloths were sold as financial circumstances re quired, and by 1971, Mattiebelle Gittinger reported that only remnants remained in the mountain villages of Lampung.46 The tapis recently acquired by this Museum is not only an outstand ing addition to our collection of Indonesian textiles, but it is one of the few tapis with anthropomorphs preserved today in museum collections in the West.47 ANNE E.
