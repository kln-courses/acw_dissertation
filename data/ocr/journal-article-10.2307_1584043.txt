<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Michael Allen Williams, The Immovable Race (Nag Hammadi Studies, Vol. 29). Leiden, Brill, 1985. XII, 239 pp. 76,- guilders. This book is one of the many good dissertations written under the direction of the late George MacRae. It discusses in great detail the Gnostic self-designation "the immovable race" (Greek: genos asaleuton), which occurs in the 1) Apocryphon of John (before 150 A.D.), the 2) Sophia of Jesus Christ (second century), 3) Zostrianos (used by Plotinus' friends, mid-third century), the 4) Three Steles of Seth (third century) and the 5) Gospel of the Egyptians (unknown date), all in all two dozen times. The term is not found anywhere else in writings of Antiquity. It reflects an ideal to achieve stability, through an ascent to a vision of the Transcendent, or through the descent of the redeemer who rescues souls from the bond of oblivion; this concept may be an amalgam of the Jewish apocalyptic motif of "standing before the Lord" and the Platonic notion of the soul's ability to ascend to the noetic and "stand" just as immovable as the ideal world of Plato and the God of Aristotle. The author denies that these five writings originated in one social group called "Sethians", because the differences are too great. The Apocryphon of John derives the immovable race from the Perfect Human Adamas, the Gospel of the Egyptians, however, derives the im- movable race from Seth. Therefore the Apocryphon of John is held not to be Sethian. This sounds plausible, because Irenaeus 1.29 attributes a version of the Apocryphon of John not to the Sethians, but to the sectarians who styled themselves "Gnostikoi" (Barbelo is an interpolation). Throughout his study the author displays a thorough knowledge of the Greek philosophical tradition. The Jewish side has been somewhat neglected: a) Speaking about the title "the Standing One" of Simon the Magi- cian and his followers, Jarl Fossum observes in his book The Name of God and the Angel of the Lord (Tiibingen 1985, 121) that this cor- responds to Samaritan qacem, the Living One. The same is to be found in the Three Steles of Seth, where God is said to be the first to stand (119,15 ff.). "You have stood, being unceasing" (119,4). The Hellenistic meaning of Hestos as found in Philo is different: "un- moved", "stable". Williams turns a blind eye on the Samaritan background of this terminology; 411</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS b) "Geradamas" does not mean "Adam the stranger" but gerai(os) adam, the translation of Adam Qadmon, archetypal Adam (the term is also attested in Mandaean literature); c) Adamas is rightly translated as "the Human" but the author fails to see that his Gnostics combined the divine, heavenly Adam, the male Glory of Ezekiel 1,26, with the Platonic idea of Humanity. The background of the "Perfect Human" is a thrice male, incredibly crude anthropomorphism; d) "Paroikesis" in Zostrianos and mentioned by Plotinus does not mean Transmigration, but Exile, galuth; e) Williams denies that the two "races" in the Acts of Andrew in- dicate two "natures" that are radically opposed to each other. He forgets the Utrecht fragment of these Acts ("you see your physis expos- ing you"). And he ignores the established fact that according to the Essene Manual of Discipline there are two toledoth, "natures", the children of light and the children of darkness, both predestined to be so (Gershom Scholem, Sefer Asaf, Jerusalem 1954). Against this perspective it is probable that the "immovable race" is also predestined to eternal bliss, whereas the children of Cain are predestined to eternal damnation. Williams tries to introduce a free will into this consistent model. It is regrettable that a book so well researched, thorough and readable, contains such obvious flaws. There is some danger that Gnosis again, as in the past, will be interpreted as if it were a Greek philosophy, not an Oriental mythology. But image always precedes concept, mythos antedates logos. 3722 BR Bilthoven, N. Houdringelaan 32 G. QUISPEL Sven Lundstrom, Die Uberlieferung der lateinischen Irenaeusuberset- zung, Uppsala 1985, 165 pages. The author of this book, one of the most gifted and prolific scholars from the school of Einar Loffstedt, published his dissertation on the Latin translation of Irenaeus in 1943. This was followed by a new work on the same subject in 1948 as well as by textcritical contributions on Irenaeus Latinus in 1955 and observations on the fourth book of the bishop of Lyons in 1969.
