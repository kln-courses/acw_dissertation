<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> A Deep Map of the South: Natural History, Cultural History, and  William Bartram’s Travels Mark Sturges When William Bartram traveled through the American South, from 1773 to 1777, he moved through a landscape of beauty  and violence. He trekked up the Savannah, the Altamaha, and the  St. Johns Rivers, encountering woods and wetlands ripe with fecun- dity, full of exotic pitcher plants, alligators and coach-whip snakes, the  wood ibis, the sandhill crane, and the great land tortoise. He wandered  overland across Florida and Georgia, to Mobile and the Mississippi.  He hiked through the Nantahalas, from Keowee to Cowee, where the  Cherokee lived, and he rode through the heart of the Creek Nation  between Coweta and Kolumi. Along the way, Bartram recorded the  names of both Indian towns and botanical species. He visited Creek  and Cherokee villages, smoked their pipes, attended their festivals, ob- served their customs, and explored their ruins. He pondered the ori- gins of the Southeastern Indians—their history of conflict, conquest,  and cultural succession—as if reading the deep time of geology. As a  natural historian, Bartram treated indigenous peoples as part of the  land, pieces of the place, but he also acknowledged their dynamic cul- tural history and the enduring presence of Indian antiquity.1 Eventually, Bartram worked his experiences into a book, a sprawl- ing excursion narrative and botanical study known in shorthand as the  Travels (1791), now a classic of American nature writing.2 In past decades,  Bartram’s work has served as a touchstone for scholars seeking to under- stand the environmental discourse of the eighteenth century. Through  numerous studies, critics have uncovered the roots (and routes) of the  Travels, positioned it within a tradition of natural history, and analyzed  its elements in relation to Quaker theology, Romantic aesthetics, U.S.  nationalism, plantation capitalism, the emerging science of ecology,  and even the author’s personal depression.3 Typically, historians place  Bartram among a group of late eighteenth-century scientists who fol- lowed in the footsteps of Carolus Linnaeus and Count Buffon. During the  1740s, Linnaeus had invented a new system of biological taxonomy that  retooled the study of natural history, prompting a massive, global mis- sion of knowledge-gathering, hence the primary purpose of Bartram’s  trip: to discover and classify new botanical species.4 43 </page> <page sequence="2"> Mark Sturges Inspired by Foucault, literary critics often view this botanical proj- ect as an extension of the imperial project, a grand conspiracy of sci- ence and power that subjugated nature, ordered its chaos, and exploit- ed its commodities. Christopher Looby and Pamela Regis, for example,  both read Bartram’s Linnaean language as an ideological device, a  mechanism akin to the surveyor’s tape. Once collected and identified,  recorded and classified, plants and animals enter a system; they are  transformed into objects, destined for museums and textbooks. In this  reading, science serves only the function of power; it neither cultivates  intimacy nor inspires ethical treatment. According to Pamela Regis,  this so-called “rhetoric of natural history” especially dehumanized  American Indians by treating them as “just another type of natural  production” (xii). Because Bartram aligned people with plants and ani- mals, he removed them from time, erased their histories, and placed  them in a static zone of scientific study—or so the reading goes.5 But not all readers of the Travels have retreated into a radical cri- tique of science. The poet James Dickey, for instance, has suggested  that Bartram employed Linnaean taxonomy to establish a deeper, more  emotional relationship with the landscape. Likewise, William Stowe  reads Bartram’s word-stacks alongside Whitman’s catalogs as poetic  expressions of the cosmic unity of the natural world. Other scholars  have identified Bartram as a proto-ecologist, recasting his botanical  project as a tribute to biodiversity and a platform for conservation.  Charlotte Porter sees Bartram as a precursor to the nineteenth-century  movement to oppose plume-hunting in the southern swamps, while  Richard Judd aligns him with a group of natural history writers who  promoted a “spirit of conservation” well before the work of John Muir  and Gifford Pinchot. Similarly, Michael Branch sets Bartram along- side Alexander Wilson and John James Audubon in a nature-writing  tradition that anticipated Thoreau, while Ian Marshall believes that  Bartram’s ecological understanding led him to embrace a politics of  social equality. In contrast to these standard interpretations, a few scholars have de- tected a profound ambivalence at the heart of the Travels, which they  diagnose either as a side effect of Bartram’s prolonged writing and revi- sion process, as a byproduct of the slippage between science and art, or  as a classic case of pastoral ideology. Thomas Hallock argues that “the  compulsion to implicate or absolve an author from an imperial context  fails to address what a work like the Travels manages to accomplish as  a narrative; that is, to imagine an alternative set of relations without  endangering the culture that it purportedly critiques” (“Borders” 127).  Like Hallock, Joshua David Bellin interprets the Travels as a kind of  slippery dialogue between white and Indian cultures, between recogni- 44 </page> <page sequence="3"> South Atlantic Review tion and dispossession of native land claims. Thus, Bellin and Hallock  have attempted to move beyond current tendencies to read Bartram’s  natural history as either a mission of colonial hegemony or a vision of  arcadian harmony.6 Despite their efforts, however, Bartram scholarship  remains fundamentally bifurcated—with one branch delivering an im- perial critique and the other trumpeting Bartram’s ecological insights. I’d like to suggest yet another explanation for the textual and critical  contradictions that continue to define the Travels. Simply put, Bartram  drafted the book not only in the wake of the American Revolution, but  also on the eve of a momentous scientific revolution that transformed  the study of both natural and cultural history. During the eighteenth  century, scientific discourse was dominated by Linnaeus and Buffon,  whose systems of taxonomy encouraged writers like Bartram to remove  objects from history, freeze them in time, and place them in botanical  tables, specimen boxes, or display cases. But at the turn of the nine- teenth century, the very structure of Linnaean taxonomy began to un- ravel, and soon the field of natural history evolved into modern biol- ogy and anthropology. According to Michel Foucault, this epistemic  shift unfolded in the span of a few years around 1800. To make sense  of this scientific revolution, I’d like to revisit Foucault’s analysis before  turning to the text of the Travels, which, I argue, embodies a kind of  “epistemic overlap” between eighteenth-century natural history and  nineteenth-century biology and anthropology. This overlap theory, I  believe, offers the best explanation for the textual and critical ambiva- lence defining the Travels. Throughout his career, Foucault sought to interrogate the histori- cal processes through which humans became both subject and object  of political, economic, and scientific discourses. Searching for the link  between knowledge and power, he highlighted the dividing practices  that different disciplines have employed to distinguish, for example,  between the sane and the insane. Naturally, such a project points to  the history of science, for taxonomy and classification are, perhaps,  the most obvious examples of dividing practices. Like Thomas Kuhn,  whose historical model of the paradigm shift explained “the structure  of scientific revolutions”—that is, the process whereby new discoveries  overturned accepted truths and resulted in new theories of nature— Foucault directed his attention to the epistemological fields (or epis- temes) that exist beneath the surface of scientific discourse, shaping  the very structure of its methodology. Thus, he described his project as  an archaeology of knowledge production and cultural discourse. In The Order of Things, Foucault unearthed three historical peri- ods of western thought: the Renaissance (up to 1650), the Classical era  (1650-1800), and the Modern era (after 1800). Between each of these  45 </page> <page sequence="4"> Mark Sturges periods, he detected a major epistemic shift that transformed the  study of natural history. In the Renaissance, objects were grouped to- gether based on resemblance and relationship, but the order of ob- jects could change depending on context. In the Classical era, how- ever, a new system of taxonomy removed objects from context, erased  their histories, and classified them in a static order outside of time.  This system rested upon the assumption of fixed identity and perma- nent difference. Finally, Foucault marked the dawn of the Modern era  around 1800, when temporality made a dramatic comeback. Suddenly,  the order of things became more fluid and objects could no longer be  detached from their personal and collective histories. Things became  lives, and Life became the new epistemological field guiding scientific  discourse. At this moment, classical grammar transformed into philol- ogy, political economy adopted new ideas of labor and production, and  natural history evolved into biology.7 Sure enough, from the mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth cen- tury, the field of natural history underwent a sweeping transformation.  But what happened in between? And why mark 1800 as the pivotal year?  The debate over extinction, I believe, offers one possible explanation,  while the emerging field of anthropology provides another. In the late  eighteenth century, natural historians began to uncover new evidence  of biological change within species—which, in turn, revealed the pos- sibility of extinction—and at the same time, these scientists became  increasingly attuned to the cultural history of their human subjects;  they began to place those subjects within a more dynamic historical  narrative; and by 1800, the descriptive manners-and-customs account  gave way to a more narrative ethnography. In other words, Bartram and  his peers pioneered new methods of cultural analysis that anticipated  the nineteenth-century field of anthropology.8 While most eighteenth-century accounts of the American South de- picted the land as a smorgasbord of commodities and looked forward  to its economic development, the Travels looked back to the natural  and cultural history of the region, constructing a “deep map” of place  that was sensitive to its ecology, its evolution through time, and its  indigenous inhabitants. In addition to surveying the natural landscape  of the South, Bartram conducted an ethnographic study of the cultur- al landscape. He visited Creek and Cherokee villages, recorded their  customs, and pondered their pasts. He devoted particular attention to  their history of conflict and conquest, their migration across the conti- nent, and their evolving political confederacies. Unlike previous writ- ers of natural history, Bartram located the Indians in time, as agents  of historical change. He described how different communities—both  human and botanical—adapted to a place, a habitat, or a climate, and  46 </page> <page sequence="5"> South Atlantic Review in the process, he portrayed Indian antiquity and cultural succession as  part and parcel of ecological change. In short, he combined the study  of natural and cultural history. Natural and Cultural Succession During the eighteenth century, most scientists embraced a doctrine  of fixed-species creation that simply could not account for the possi- bility of extinction. They believed that God had created all creatures  and none could vanish without his consent. The Great Chain of Being  was the preferred metaphor for visualizing relationships between spe- cies, and no individual could exist apart from its kingdom, class, order,  and genus—nor could any species disappear, for such an extinction  would upset the divine design. Neither Linnaeus, Buffon, nor Thomas  Jefferson believed that a species would entirely vanish, though it might  diminish or degenerate. In Notes on the State of Virginia (1787), while  asserting the existence of the mammoth, Jefferson wrote, “Such is the  oeconomy of nature, that no instance can be produced of her having  permitted any one race of her animals to become extinct; of her having  formed any link in her great work so weak as to be broken” (53-54).  According to historian Mark Barrow, not until the 1790s, when Georges  Cuvier conducted his comparative study of fossil remains, did natural  historians begin to accept the fact of extinction. By the 1850s, fixed- species creation had largely fallen out of favor; before long, Darwin  published his dangerous idea; and from then on, natural history yield- ed to the field of evolutionary biology.9 For Foucault, Cuvier’s intervention marks the dawn of modernity,  the origin of a new epistemological field. But we can trace this break- through back to the mid-eighteenth century, to the work of scientists  (like Bartram) who studied the limits of naturalization and found evi- dence of localized extinctions. Alan Bewell labels this aspect of eigh- teenth-century natural history an “emerging field of biogeography”  (116) and like other scholars, he illuminates the discourse by describ- ing the famous debate between Count Buffon and Thomas Jefferson.10  In the voluminous Natural History: General and Particular (1749-88),  Buffon argued that the climate of the New World had produced species  inferior to the Old World and subject to generational decline—what  he called “degeneration.” Buffon did not believe that species actually  changed when located in a new context, but their ability to reproduce  effectively declined. To support his theory, Buffon cited several failed  efforts to naturalize European plants and animals in North America.  In response, Jefferson dispatched agents to recover the bones of a giant  47 </page> <page sequence="6"> Mark Sturges moose and shipped them to Buffon in France. In Notes on the State of  Virginia, Jefferson insisted that “situation” and “circumstance” deter- mined the cultural and biological character of different populations  (60), and he refuted Buffon’s theory of degeneration by moving from a  discussion of native plants and animals to Native Americans, a trajec- tory that Bartram later replicated in the Travels. Although Linnaeus  taught Bartram to see nature as a fixed system, Buffon and Jefferson led  Bartram to believe that environmental context could in fact alter the  biological character of species. Throughout the Travels, Bartram voices this principle of environ- mental determinism when he describes plant and animal habitat, but  nowhere is it more pronounced than in Part II when he compares the  Creeks (or Muskogees) of the Alabama and Chattahoochee River re- gions with the Seminoles of central Florida.11 According to Bartram,  because the Creeks reside near their enemies, the Choctaws, in an area  exposed to attack from all sides, they have evolved a “more strict gov- ernment or civilization than the Indians in general” (133). They live in  large towns, congregated together, which forces wild game to the pe- rimeter of their settlements and “obliges them to be vigilant and indus- trious,” thus shaping their “natural disposition” (133). In contrast, the  Seminoles, though fewer in number, possess a larger territory naturally  defended against invasion. Abundant in fish and game, Seminole land  far exceeds the privation of Creek territory. In turn, this “superabun- dance” makes the Seminole people “free from want or desires” and “as  blithe and free as the birds of the air” (134). Thus does Bartram engage  in a kind of comparative anthropology that draws upon the insights of  biogeography.  Likewise, Bartram and his fellow botanists understood the process  of natural succession in which an area transforms from a marsh to a  swamp, or a grassland to a forest, and the Travels devotes several pas- sages to this process of ecological change. During his first excursion  up the Savannah River, he suggests that the native fauna show signs of  colonial conquest: “As for the animal productions, they are the same  which originally inhabited this part of North America, except such as  have been affrighted away since the invasion of the Europeans” (29- 30). “The buffalo,” he continues, “once so very numerous, is not at this  day to be seen in this part of the country” (30). Meanwhile, Bartram  ponders the potential of the land to renew itself. Although St. Simons  Island “had formerly been cleared and planted by the English,” he ob- serves, “it is now overgrown with forests” (40). Such attention to eco- logical change comes to the foreground in Bartram’s account of Lake  George: “About fifteen years ago I visited this place, at which time there  were no settlements of white people, but all appeared wild and savage;  48 </page> <page sequence="7"> South Atlantic Review yet in that uncultivated state, it possessed an almost inexpressible air  of grandeur which was now entirely changed” (64). Bartram proceeds  to lament the loss of a “venerable old grove” that settlers have cleared  for agricultural production, and later, while traveling across Florida,  he writes, “I have often been affected with extreme regret, at behold- ing the destruction and devastation which has been committed . . . on  those extensive, fruitful Orange groves” (160). Bartram realized, however, that such ecological change did not  simply begin with the arrival of Europeans. Instead, for Bartram, the  land told stories of a fluid history in which native communities worked  within and against the local environment. Throughout the Travels, he  finds places where Indians have burned the forest to make accessible  hunting grounds or clearings for agriculture. He also discovers Indian  ruins and burial grounds, describing them as “mounts” or “artificial  hills,” thus blurring the line between nature and culture (43, 232).  While visiting native communities, Bartram imagines past conflicts in  order to reconstruct the process that brought about current settlement  patterns. These sketches of cultural history often parallel accounts of  natural history. After exploring the Ogeechee mounds, Bartram shifts  to describe “the ravages of the common grey caterpillar” (43). Likewise,  following his violent encounter with a “tribe” of alligators, he awakes  in the morning to find himself camping atop an “ancient burying  ground” where the Yamasees were “slain by the Creeks in the last de- cisive battle” (88). During another excursion up the Savannah River,  Bartram passes through “a wild country now almost depopulated” that  contains “heaps of white, gnawed bones of the ancient buffaloe, elk  and deer, indiscriminately mixed with those of men” (204). In such  scenes, Bartram depicts the southern landscape as shifting beneath  him. It’s an unstable terrain, full of swamps and sink holes, haunted  by ghosts, inscribed with violence. And from these pieces of the past— these mounds, burial grounds, and ghost towns—he assembles a com- plex narrative of Indian history, a story of conflict, conquest, displace- ment, and succession.12 Put another way, Bartram portrays the Deep South as more than a  physical location; it is also a temporal narrative, a terrain where the  traveler may wander through a kind of dreamtime. While crossing cen- tral Georgia on the trading path into Creek territory, he passes an “old  Ocone town” abandoned by the Indians in the wake of white settle- ment. First, the inhabitants migrated west into Upper Creek territory,  but “that situation not suiting their roving disposition” (240), they  wandered south into Florida, built the village of Cuscowilla near the  Alachua Savanna, and reinvented themselves as the Seminoles. Along  the Mississippi, Bartram tells yet another tale of a French settlement  49 </page> <page sequence="8"> Mark Sturges striving to “establish” itself at the Natchez cliffs. Ignoring the “sover- eigns of the soil,” the French built a fort and several plantations, often  committing acts of cruelty against the native people, until finally the  settlement was destroyed during an Indian raid. Fifty years later, when  Bartram arrives, a “very respectable village” has again “established”  itself (274-275). Thus, Bartram views human history—both Indian and  European—as subject to natural change, constantly struggling against  time, territorial invasion, and the threat of violence. Critics too often overlook this temporal dimension of the Travels.  According to Pamela Regis, for example, Bartram’s natural history  project necessarily “presents America . . . as outside of time” (25). In  works like the Travels, she contends, “Native Americans are subsumed  under this natural historical description, becoming entries on a list,  links on the chain. The rhetoric of this description denies them any  history, individual or cultural, because that rhetoric did not include  a way to represent time” (25). Unfortunately, Regis ignores the many  moments in which Bartram engages with Indians on a personal level,  in narrative time, seeking permission for his botanical studies, partici- pating in their rituals, and soliciting them for information about their  cultural history. Even Mary Louise Pratt, who criticizes the imperial di- mension of natural history writing, admits that the genre often shapes  description into a “storyline” (26).13 Indeed, not only does Bartram de- scribe the Southeastern Indians, he also narrates their cultural history. Consider, for example, Bartram’s attention to the Creek migration  story, which surfaces at multiple sites in the text of the Travels. In Part  I of the book, after paddling a stretch of the Altamaha River, Bartram  pauses to describe the Ocmulgee Mounds several miles upstream, an  aside that inspires an additional reflection about the history of the  Creek Indians, the people who (he believes) succeeded the mound- builders in the region.14 Later, in Part III, Bartram visits the Creek  settlement of Apalachicola along the Chattahoochee River, where he  wanders through the “artificial mounds or terraces” of an “ancient”  town predating the arrival of the Creeks (246-47). While exploring the  site, Bartram begins to imagine the collapse of the great chiefdoms of  the American Southeast—“like the ruin or dispersion of the ancient  Babel” (247)—the diaspora of Indian peoples into scattered villages,  the influx of new nations from the west, and the ultimate formation  of the Creek confederacy. In other words, he constructs a deep map of  Creek nation-building, a temporal cartography charting their conquest  of the Yamasees, their unsteady alliance with the Cherokees and the  Chickasaws, and their ongoing struggle with the Choctaws. Like the  ancient Greeks and Romans, says Bartram, the Creeks engage in war- fare for the sake of national glory, and much like the United States, they  50 </page> <page sequence="9"> South Atlantic Review also embrace the dream of a “universal confederacy or commonwealth”  (248). Accordingly, Bartram connected the past of Indian history to the  future of republican ideology in an ongoing narrative of natural and  cultural succession. Instead of locating native peoples in a static zone  outside of time, he saw them as participants in a long human history of  intercultural contact and conflict, expansion and imperialism.15 At the end of Part III, after returning to Savannah, Bartram offers  a final reflection upon the Creek migration story, but this time he  tests the oral account against the written work of the French historian  Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz, who published a history of Louisiana  in 1758 (translated into English in 1763), a book that Bartram consulted  while drafting the Travels.16 The passage reveals much about Bartram’s  ethnographic methodology: It appears to me pretty clearly, from divers circumstances,  that this powerful empire or confederacy of the Creeks or  Muscogulges, arose from, and established itself upon the ruins  of that of the Natches, agreeably to Monsier Duprat. According  to the Muscogulges account of themselves, they arrived from  the South-West, beyond the Mississipi, some time before the  English settled the colony of Carolina and built Charleston;  and their story concerning their country and people, from  whence they sprang, the cause of leaving their native land, the  progress of their migration, &amp;c. is very similar to that celebrat- ed historian’s account of the Natches, they might have been  included as allies and confederates in that vast and powerful  empire of red men. The Muscogulges gradually pushing and  extending their settlements on their North-East border, until  the dissolution of the Natches empire; being then the most  numerous, warlike and powerful tribe, they began to subju- gate the various tribes or bands (which formerly constituted  the Natches) and uniting them with themselves, formed a new  confederacy under the name of the Muscogulges. (294) Such a narrative resembles the stories Europeans told of their own ar- rival in North America. Its theme of removal and migration, trial and  progress, might equally apply to Plymouth Plantation, while its vision of  political unification reveals a potent imperial project. Meanwhile, this  history of the Creek confederacy also hearkens back to Bartram’s intro- duction, where he imagines a more perfect union between American  Indians and the new American Republic. He implies that both Indians  and Europeans participate in the process of nation-building; he finds a  common imperial drive, a shared history of territorial expansion; and  51 </page> <page sequence="10"> Mark Sturges in doing so, he insists that native peoples cannot be jammed into a  fixed category—they cannot be removed from history. Ethnohistorians now believe that Bartram got some of the facts  wrong, but not as many as his contemporaries.17 More importantly, for  our purposes, Bartram’s study of Creek migration combined European  and Indian sources—written and oral histories—in a manner that  anticipated the ethnographic approaches of the nineteenth century.  He consulted the Indians for their version of the past, he compared  their accounts to the written archive, and his cultural analysis led  many of his contemporaries to revise their understanding of Indian  history. Likewise, Bartram’s work later influenced nineteenth-century  archaeologists like Ephraim Squier, who published studies of Indian  mounds in 1848 and 1850. A few years later, in 1853, Squier printed one  of Bartram’s previously unpublished manuscripts, “Observations on  the Creek and Cherokee Indians,” in the Transactions of the American  Ethnological Society. Thus, we can link Bartram’s writings to both the  natural history tradition of the 1750s and to the cultural history of the  1850s.18 Predation and Political Unification As a Quaker, Bartram disapproved of political warfare, but as a scientist  he recognized that predation was necessary to maintain the balance of  nature. Thus, he suggested that war arose from a common, biological  impulse. “The Indians make war against, kill and destroy their own  species,” he wrote, “and their motives spring from the same erroneous  source as it does in all other nations of mankind” (135). Just as animals  commit acts of aggression to defend or expand their territory, Bartram  concludes, so do human nations, both Indian and European—but he  has mixed feelings about the behavior. On the one hand, it violates his  ethical principles, but on the other, it validates his theory of nature;  warfare, that is, balances the political food chain much like predation  balances the biological food chain. When describing the history of the  Creeks, Bartram portrays war as a necessary evil, the prelude to a per- petual peace. By the end of the Travels, however, he begins to express  a creeping anxiety about the threat of an Indian war on the southern  frontier, which puts his own safety in jeopardy, causing him to aban- don his botanical studies, retrace the trading path across Georgia, and  return to Philadelphia. From the very beginning of the Travels, this theme of predation  blurs the line between natural and cultural history. Bartram opens the  introduction, for instance, with a brief discourse on the imperatives of  52 </page> <page sequence="11"> South Atlantic Review natural history, describing his approach in the very first sentence. “The  attention of a traveller,” he writes, “should be particularly turned, in  the first place, to the various works of Nature.” Even as he announces  this first priority, however, Bartram declares that “Men and manners  undoubtedly hold the first rank” (li). Thus the narrative begins with  a paradox: both “Nature” and “Man” are “first” in the study of natu- ral history. For Bartram, this paradox was not a problem, because he  viewed mankind as part of the natural world. As a philosopher of natu- ral history, steeped in the science of his age, he saw man as a link in the  Great Chain of Being and also as the privileged member of the earthly  domain. Nature exists for man, he believed; its productions serve the  “human economy” (lii). Hence, he hoped to “promote the happiness  and convenience of mankind” (li). Meanwhile, he desired to exalt the  divine creation, attributing all natural productions to a “sovereign  Creator” or “great Author” who charitably sustains the happiness of his  creatures (li, lii). This is the conventional rhetoric of natural history:  the traveler at once glorifies nature as the work of God and interprets  nature in the service of culture. Despite this benevolent premise, Bartram immediately shifts to  survey a series of predatory relationships. First, he admires the pro- vocative design of the pitcher plant, which “cheerfully” invites botani- cal reverie both for its beauty and its adaptation to the environment.  Anticipating Darwin, Bartram assigns such adaptation to the agency of  “nature,” which has “furnished” the leaves with a defense mechanism  against heavy rains (liv). But not all aspects of the pitcher plant are so  curiously benign. “[S]ee these short stiff hairs,” Bartram raves, “they all  point downwards, which direct the condensed vapors down into the  funiculum” (liv). Suddenly, on a devilish whim, Bartram has thrust the  trajectory of the perspective away from the high design of the heavens  into the hellish chaos of a carnivorous plant. He continues: “these stiff  hairs also prevent the varieties of insects, which are caught, from re- turning, being invited down to sip the mellifluous exuvia, from the in- terior surface of the tube, where they inevitably perish; what quantities  there are of them!” (liv). For Bartram, the plant’s interior has become  a territory of violence strewn with bodies—an insect burial ground, a  little shop of horrors. Bartram replicates this zone of predation throughout the introduc- tion, raising the stakes each time. After the pitcher plant, he shifts his  attention to the Venus’ fly-trap, whose appetitive inclinations hide  behind a “gay and ludicrous” façade, a grotesque form of deception.  Like a malevolent machine, the fly-trap remains “ready on the spring  to intrap the deluded insects.” Swiftly, Bartram’s botanical description  transforms into a conquest narrative: “what artifice! there behold one  53 </page> <page sequence="12"> Mark Sturges of the leaves just closed upon a struggling fly, another has got a worm,  its hold is sure, its prey can never escape—carnivorous vegetable!” (liv).  Moments later, Bartram describes a human hunter stalking a bear dam  and her cub, employing the same “artifice” as a predatory plant, shoot- ing both mother and child without remorse (lvii). Likewise, in a bloody  episode Bartram surprises a spider hunting a bumble bee. The spider  turns upon him, “as if ready to spring,” disturbed by the human in- trusion into his “predatory attempts against the insect tribes” (lix). As  Bartram watches, the spider returns to his prey, leaping upon the back  of the bee, trailing behind him a strand of web fastened to a twig. For  fifteen minutes, the spider clings to the bee as it circles through the air,  attempting to break the line of web and suffering from the “repeated  wounds of the butcher.” Bartram seems almost to relish the violence.  Finally, “the devouring spider” carries the bee back to the tree “and  perhaps before night became himself, the delicious evening repast of a  bird or lizard” (lix). Such is the story of the food chain. Bartram’s introduction, I would like to suggest, emphasizes preda- tion in order to forge an alliance between the two poles of his focus,  “Nature” and “Man.” Not only does Bartram see plants and animals as  symbiotic players in predator-prey relationships, but he employs the  same language to describe them. Like animals, carnivorous plants have  “motion and volition,” and both the fly-trap and the hunter operate  with “artifice.” Upon the death of its mother, the bear cub “approached  the dead body, smelled, and pawed it, and appearing in agony, fell to  weeping and looking upwards . . . and cried out like a child” (lvii).  Through metaphor and juxtaposition, Bartram subverts the strict  categories of natural science. A “cunning intrepid hunter,” the spider  “conducted his subtil approaches, with the circumspection and perse- verance of a Siminole, when hunting a deer” (lix). Thereafter, Bartram  delivers an anthropomorphic description of birds. “Birds are in general  social and benevolent creatures,” he writes, “intelligent, ingenious, vol- atile, active beings, and this order of animal creation consists of various  nations, bands, or tribes” (lix). These birds have language and dialect;  they compose musical scores; they express emotional tenderness, af- fection, and passion; they even possess immortal souls.  As a natural historian, Bartram worked to understand the place of  every plant and animal in the natural world. He imagined each organ- ism endowed with a common “vital principle” and subject to the “econ- omy of nature,” a phrase inherited from Linnaeus. Like other Linnaeans,  Bartram believed in the fundamental order of nature, and he under- stood predation as the mechanism that maintained the natural balance.  According to Donald Worster, the Linnaeans envisioned “nature’s econ- omy” as a series of cycles repeated and replicated throughout the organic  54 </page> <page sequence="13"> South Atlantic Review world: the water cycle, the seasonal pattern, life and death, propagation  and preservation, destruction and succession. Predator-prey relation- ships participated in this circular paradigm, but they were not without  moral justification. To reconcile the problem of predation, Linnaeans  adopted three principles of intelligent design. First, they saw nature as  a machine, with God as the sovereign craftsman. Second, they insisted  on God’s benevolence, believing that the world was ordered for human  prosperity, despite its occasional dangers. And third, they represented  nature as a Great Chain of Being in which all parts were linked in an  interdependent web.19 Bartram’s text certainly participates in the Linnaean tradition;  that much is obvious from his use of taxonomy. But the Travels does  not simply rationalize its scenes of predation within a conventional  system. It also arranges those scenes to challenge the rigid hierarchy  embedded in the Linnaean world view—and in the process, Bartram  pushes eighteenth-century scientific discourse toward the insights  of nineteenth-century biology. Ultimately, he says, “If we bestow  but a very little attention to the economy of the animal creation, we  shall find manifest examples of premeditation, perseverance, resolu- tion, and consummate artifice” (lvii). In other words, Bartram goes  beyond Linnaeus by interpreting predation as evidence of botanical  and animal personhood. He anthropomorphizes plants and animals,  elevating each species in the Chain of Being, and thus makes a case  for universal ethical rights. Michael Branch sees this moral maneu- ver as a “strain of radical nonanthropocentrism” (288), while Richard  Judd describes it as a kind of “pan-rationalism,” attributing it widely to  Bartram’s “upbringing and temperament, his Quaker sense of humil- ity, his love of natural beauty, and his somewhat reclusive preference  for nature over civilization” (205-06). Similarly, Ian Marshall perceives  a relationship between Bartram’s depiction of the natural world and  his opposition to slavery. Marshall suggests that perhaps Bartram’s eco- logical insights led him to advocate cultural tolerance; that is, he em- braced social equality precisely because he saw humans as part of the  natural world. In this reading, Bartram becomes an advocate of animal  rights, a prophet of ecopiety, and the spokesman for a land ethic that  anticipates twentieth-century deep ecology.  This argument has become second nature to ecological readings of  the Travels, and rightly so, since it highlights an important element  of Bartram’s thought—one that carries with it radical implications.  Simply put, Bartram sees no “essential difference” between plants,  animals, and Indians. He describes natural productions, like human  cultures, as organized into “tribes” or “nations,” and he considers how  plants, like humans, possess the means of “transplanting or colonis- 55 </page> <page sequence="14"> Mark Sturges ing their tribes” (lv). Indeed, the allusion to colonialism is no simple  coincidence. Meanwhile, Bartram emphasizes the role of “climate” in  shaping both biological and cultural phenomena, and he stresses the  importance of going to the place where native species “naturally dwell.”  To study the fly-trap, he declares, “[L]et us advance to the spot” (liv).  To conduct diplomacy with the Indians, the federal government should  begin “sending men of ability and virtue . . . as friendly visitors, into  their towns” (lxi). Bartram also analyzes the language and dialect of  the birds, an ethnographic approach which he eventually applies to the  American Indian, using comparative linguistics to classify their cultur- al groups. Finally, Bartram concludes the introduction by shifting from  nature to culture, from plants and animals to the “Indian nations” of  the American South. In the process, he counters the prevailing cultural  prejudice and contemplates the possibility of a “revolution” bringing  about a more congenial “union” between whites and Indians. Like the  Constitution, Bartram’s vision of Indian policy aims to create a more  perfect union without resorting to “coercive or violent means” (lxi). In  political affairs, Bartram desires to avoid the depredation of predation.  He suggests that perhaps humans can adapt beyond the self-interest  of predation—beyond the violence of colonialism—to arrive at a more  cooperative social community. Such adaptation depends upon locating the proper place, the right  environment. In Part II of the Travels, Bartram discovers a riparian  phenomenon where a tributary flows into Lake George and forms a  clear, watery expanse without cover or obstruction. Because the clar- ity of the water eliminates covert operations, this crystal bason offers  its inhabitants a temporary reprieve from predation. In such a natu- ral space, alligators, garfish, trout, bream, catfish, stingrays, skates,  bass, drum, and flounder—all the “separate bands and communi- ties”—swim about with “no signs of enmity,” performing their evolu- tions “with free and unsuspicious intercourse” (105). Bartram sees this  place as a “representation” of possibility, where different species and  communities, though elsewhere in conflict, might come together in  “equality” (106). In other words, place has the capacity to shape cultural  relationships and promote cultural tolerance. Likewise, on the Alachua  Savanna, Bartram imagines a future settlement thriving on the natu- ral conditions of climate and fertility. “[B]y the arts of agriculture and  commerce,” he writes, “almost every desirable thing in life might be  produced and made plentiful here” (148). However, in the same para- graph where Bartram envisions this national scheme of agricultural  improvement, he also stresses the sovereignty of the Seminoles, thus  revealing the ambiguity at the heart of his attempt to frame cultural  history. The very space that might make possible a republican empire  56 </page> <page sequence="15"> South Atlantic Review was already inhabited, and the future of the nation required bringing  those inhabitants into the fold of the new government or removing  them elsewhere. Bartram envisioned a peaceful solution to this geopolitical prob- lem, even as his nation moved increasingly toward violence. Though  he never held public office, he used the medium of natural history to  advance his benevolent cause. George Washington, John Adams, and  Thomas Jefferson all purchased copies of the Travels. When they read  the first edition in 1791, they would have encountered these lines: I presume not to dictate in these high concerns of government,  and I am fully convinced that such important matters are far  above my ability; the duty and respect we owe to religion and  rectitude, the most acceptable incense we can offer to the  Almighty, as an atonement for our negligence, in the care of  the present and future well being of our Indian brethren, in- duces me to mention this matter. (lxi) Bartram died in 1823, seven years before Congress passed the Indian  Removal Act and fifteen years before the Cherokees set forth on their  tragic walk to the west. He never saw that final fate, but for a brief  moment he presented the possibility of a more accommodating future.  He saw the study of natural and cultural history as the prerequisite to a  more humane Indian policy, and he imagined a place for the Indians in  the new American Republic. The Deep Time of the Travels At the end of the eighteenth century, following the American  Revolution, a new fascination with Indian mounds swept across the  United States, and Bartram certainly jumped on the bandwagon. But  as Gordon Sayre has suggested, depending upon an author’s genre and  ideology, the mounds invited different interpretations. For some, the  ruins revealed a kind of North American classical antiquity—that is,  they confirmed the existence of a proto-Indian civilization—and so re- futed Buffon’s argument that the New World lacked a viable cultural  history. If the continent once supported a great civilization of mound- building Americans, these writers reasoned, then the potential re- mained for a new American empire to rise up and redeem the fallen  past. Meanwhile, by depicting the Southeastern Indians as a race of  barbarians who had vanquished the ancient mound builders, Euro- 57 </page> <page sequence="16"> Mark Sturges Americans stripped the Indians of their indigenous rights to the land  and justified policies of removal.20 On the surface, by constructing a vision of vanishing peoples,  Bartram’s description of Indian mounds may have aided this mis- sion of conquest and displacement—and thus, critics of the Travels  may detect a rationale for Indian removal. On a deeper level, how- ever, Bartram’s narrative of Creek migration and confederation hardly  erased the Indians’ claims to the land. Instead, by recording their  effort to establish a universal political confederacy, Bartram elevated  the status of the Creek nation. He aligned their imperial ambitions  with the British, Spanish, and French colonial powers, and he saw a  similarity between their political confederacy and the new American  Republic. Indeed, I believe that Bartram’s study of Indian history actu- ally enhanced the political legitimacy of the Creek and Cherokee peo- ples and so strengthened his proposal for a more benevolent approach  to U.S.-Indian relations.  Because of his attention to the many layers of Indian history (and  pre-history), Bartram seems to have anticipated the “deep time” ap- proach to cultural analysis that Wai Chee Dimock has proposed in  a different context.21 Bartram’s interest in Indian mounds and ruins,  along with his attention to Creek and Cherokee migration stories, ef- fectively decentered the geographic and historical trajectory of Euro- American empire. Whereas the ideology of imperialism imagined  the U.S. nation-state advancing west across the American continent,  Bartram portrayed a culture of dynamic Indian peoples with their own  political ideals migrating east across the continent, and this counter- narrative pushed against the U.S. progress narrative. Bartram’s study of  deep time—his deep map of the American South—articulated a more  pluralistic vision of American history, and in turn, bolstered his ar- gument for a more diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and the  Indian nations, all of whom shared a common colonial history. As a Quaker, an artist, and a botanist, Bartram narrated his experi- ences in multiple registers. Under the influence of religion, he praised  the divine design, representing God as a sovereign creator, the great  author of an elaborate text. He also believed that a common vital  principle circulated through the entire universe. Plants, animals, and  humans were all subject to the same laws, the same natural processes.  Following Burke, Bartram marveled at the sublime quality of nature,  the simultaneous awe and terror of dangerous scenes, whether a storm  at sea or a spider stalking a bumble-bee, the Appalachian Mountains  or the Alachua Savanna. As a scientist, he attempted to reconcile these  emotional responses with the empirical project of natural history.  While predation offered a taste of the sublime, it also revealed a net- 58 </page> <page sequence="17"> South Atlantic Review work of interspecies relationships that blurred the line between nature  and culture, sometimes challenging the notion of human dominion,  sometimes locating acts of cultural violence under the rubric of natu- ral phenomena. Like other natural historians of the eighteenth cen- tury, Bartram understood predatory relationships as part of the Great  Chain of Being in which each species played a crucial role to sustain  “the economy of nature.” But Bartram went further than his peers in  emphasizing the correspondence between natural and cultural history,  and in this sense, he anticipated the insights of modern biology and  anthropology. If we accept Foucault’s theory of an epistemic break occurring  around 1800, then we might place Bartram in a kind of “epistemic  overlap” between eighteenth-century natural history and nineteenth- century biology and anthropology. But that scientific revolution was  not without political implications. In the Travels, Bartram employed  natural and cultural history to frame a vision of the political future.  Connecting nature and culture, he rewrote the past as a narrative of  ecological relationships between human communities and the natural  world. He did not remove the Indians from time, as some critics have  argued, nor from the land, as U.S. policy would later do, but rather he  saw them as agents in a natural-cultural history of colonial contact—a  history that predated the European arrival in North America. He em- phasized their past displacement, migration, and succession in order  to suggest that Indians participated in the process of nation-building,  but he did not call for their removal. Instead, amidst the ratification of  the Constitution, he imagined a more perfect union between American  Indians and the new American Republic. His deep map of the South  envisioned a political geography of pluralism, a kind of multicultural  federalism and accommodation, and not the flattening form of imperi- alism and acculturation that came to pass. Notes I would like to thank Timothy Sweet for organizing a panel about natural his- tory and temporality at the 2013 Society of Early Americanists conference.  Professor Sweet, my fellow panelists, and several audience members helped  me to think through the argument of this article and enhance the connection  to current trends in American literary studies. 1. For biographical background and details related to Bartram’s travels, I draw  primarily upon Thomas Slaughter and Edward Cashin. I am also indebted to  Gregory Waselkov and Kathryn Holland Braund for contextualizing Bartram’s  experiences among the Southeastern Indians. 59 </page> <page sequence="18"> Mark Sturges 2. The full title of Bartram’s book is Travels through North &amp; South Carolina,  Georgia, East &amp; West Florida, the Cherokee Country, the Extensive Territories  of the Muscogulges, or Creek Confederacy, and the Country of the Chactaws;  Containing an Account of the Soil and Natural Productions of Those Regions,  Together with Observations on the Manners of the Indians (Philadelphia: James  and Johnson, 1791). In this article, I quote from The Travels of William Bartram:  Naturalist’s Edition, edited by Francis Harper, hereafter cited parenthetically.  Although Bartram’s additional writings can certainly enhance our understand- ing of his view of American Indians, only the Travels appeared in print during  his lifetime, so I have chosen to focus on this primary text. 3. Here, for example, is a partial taxonomy of recent criticism: Christoph  Irmscher and Stephanie Volmer both situate the Travels within a tradition of  natural history. Larry Clarke and Kerry Walter explain the influence of Quaker  theology on the text. L. Hugh Moore and Judith Magee discuss Bartram’s  aesthetics. Christopher Looby, Douglas Anderson, Pamela Regis, and Erica  Hannickel assess the political ideology of the Travels. Monique Allewaert and  Christopher Iannini interpret the Travels in relation to the plantation system.  Charles Adams, Michael Branch, Ian Marshall, Matthew Wynn Sivils, and  Monique Allewaert all view the Travels as evidence of an emerging ecological  perspective in the late eighteenth century. Finally, Thomas Slaughter’s superb  biography of John and William Bartram employs a kind of psychoanalysis to  make sense of the relationship between father and son (and the natural world). 4. In Nature’s Economy, Donald Worster classifies Bartram as a disciple of  Linnaeus and a member of the “imperial tradition” of eighteenth-century  science (33). Worster sketches a very broad pre-history of ecological thought  during the eighteenth century, in which he outlines two major trends, an ar- cadian stance (represented by Gilbert White) and the imperial tradition (rep- resented by Linnaeus). Importantly, however, Worster complicates this strict  dichotomy by identifying tendencies within the imperial tradition that echoed  the harmonious humility of the arcadians. Bartram would seem to express  similar tendencies, but Worster mentions him only in passing. Similarly, his- torians Robert Elman and Richard Judd locate Bartram within a tradition of  eighteenth-century natural history. 5. In The Poetics of Natural History, Christoph Irmscher delivers a more bal- anced analysis of Bartram’s Travels but draws many of the same conclusions  as Regis. Irmscher suggests that the Travels functions as a series of snapshots,  visual images removed from time, like a museum collection of natural arti- facts. This “dynamic stasis,” as Irmscher calls it, results in a “suspension of the  temporal by the visual” (39). Thus, Irmscher seems to follow Regis in declar- ing that natural history writing removes objects from time, but he goes on  to undermine that argument. Emphasizing the temporal quality of Bartram’s  Franklinia Alatamaha painting, Irmscher reads a narrative dimension back  into the natural history collection. He calls this a “playful balancing of tempo- ral succession and visual simultaneity” (46-47). 60 </page> <page sequence="19"> South Atlantic Review 6. In addition to Hallock and Bellin, scholars who discuss the rhetorical or  textual slippage of the Travels include Judith Magee, Stephanie Volmer, and  Nancy Hoffman. 7. Because previous historians had failed to uncover these different epistemo- logical fields, Foucault argued, they had lapsed into anachronism: “Historians  want to write histories of biology in the eighteenth century; but they do not  realize that biology did not exist then, and that the pattern of knowledge that  has been familiar to us for a hundred and fifty years is not valid for a previous  period. And that, if biology was unknown, there was a very simple reason for  it: that life did not exist. All that existed was living beings, which were viewed  through a grid of knowledge constituted by natural history” (127). 8. I am not the first scholar to cast Bartram as a proto-anthropologist. In  William Bartram on the Southeastern Indians, Gregory Waselkov and Kathryn  Holland Braund make a similar argument, but I take their analysis in a dif- ferent critical direction by suggesting that Bartram’s ethnographic approach  can explain the textual ambivalence of the Travels. Historians often date the  origins of modern anthropology to the late-nineteenth century, when ethnog- raphers like James Mooney and John Swanton conducted their studies among  the Southeastern Indians, but professional training programs did not begin  until the early-twentieth century. Terry Barnhart, on the other hand, argues  that anthropology began to separate itself from natural history as early as  the 1840s, when archaeologists like Ephraim Squier initiated more scientific  methods of cultural analysis. At this time, a number of new anthropological  societies sprang up in the U.S., including the American Ethnological Society  (1842), the Smithsonian Institution (1846), and the American Association for  the Advancement of Science (1848). We might trace these developments to an  earlier date as well, to the work of Henry Rowe Schoolcraft and John Howard  Payne, both of whom drew upon Bartram’s ethnography of the Southeastern  Indians. 9. In Nature’s Ghosts, Mark Barrow offers a helpful history of extinction dis- course from the mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century. As Barrow  observes, before Cuvier, natural historians believed that the “loss of any or- ganism across its entire range implied an unacceptable imperfection in God’s  creation, while violating deep-seated assumptions about the balance of nature  and the great chain of being that proved central to Western understandings of  how that creation was ordered” (19). From what I understand, the literary critic  Timothy Sweet is also currently working on a study of extinction discourse in  the eighteenth and nineteenth century. For a sample of that work, see “The  Eighteenth-Century Archives du Monde: The Question of Agency in Extinction  Discourse,” in Oddball Archives, eds. Judith Roof and Jonathan Eburne, forth- coming from Indiana University Press.  10. Bewell also suggests that “One of the more radical gestures of eighteenth- century naturalists, from Linnaeus onward, was to argue that human beings,  though impressive as a species, nevertheless were part of natural history” (119).  See Stanley Hedeen for a lively summary of the debate between Jefferson and  Buffon. For a comprehensive history of biogeography, see Janet Browne. 61 </page> <page sequence="20"> Mark Sturges 11. Bartram’s terms are somewhat confusing here. The Seminoles actually be- longed to the Creek confederacy, but Bartram sets them apart for the sake of  comparison. In this passage, he also blurs the line between the Upper and Lower  Creeks, preferring to define the Creek nation as those people who resided in the  main villages near the headwaters of both the Alabama and the Chattahoochee  Rivers. Elsewhere, he refers more broadly to the Creek nation, including the  Seminoles of Florida. See Gregory Waselkov and Kathryn Holland Braund for  more details about Bartram’s travels among the Southeastern Indians. 12. Similarly, Monique Allewaert has suggested that Bartram portrays the Deep  South as a liquid terrain, a shifting landscape that threatens to dissolve at  any moment and plunge the white traveler into a moral and material abyss.  Provocatively, Allewaert implies that southern swamps enable a kind of politi- cal and geographic resistance among African slaves and maroon colonies, and  thus she attributes (dubiously, perhaps) an ethical agenda to the land itself. 13. In Imperial Eyes, Pratt suggests that even natural historians who saw them- selves as benign or benevolent still participated in the imperial project by ex- ploring the “contact zone,” mapping its boundaries, and conducting episte- mological surveillance. According to Pratt, “natural history provided means  for narrating inland travel and exploration aimed not at the discovery of trade  routes, but at territorial surveillance, appropriation of resources, and adminis- trative control” (38). Scholars like Thomas Hallock have borrowed Pratt’s con- cept of the “anti-conquest” narrative—the term she uses to describe the impe- rial implications of natural history and travel writing—to interpret Bartram’s  Travels, but I hope to complicate this label by suggesting that Bartram actually  adopts a more sensitive and self-aware form of ethnography.  14. Technically, the Creeks did not succeed the mound-builders in the way that  Bartram suggests. See Vernon Knight for an analysis of the cultural link be- tween the mound-builders and the modern Indians of the American South  (i.e., the Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, etc.). 15. In Facing East from Indian Country, Daniel Richter explains how the great  chiefdoms of the American Southeast collapsed during the sixteenth century,  but their decline may have had more to do with internal pressures and con- flicts than with the arrival of European colonists. In turn, the descendants  of the chiefdoms formed new village communities and forged new cultural  identities—among them, the Creeks, the Cherokees, the Choctaws, and the  Chickasaws. Bartram was fascinated with this history of cultural evolution, this  story of change and adaptation, and like Richter, he attempted to understand  this past by “facing east from Indian country.” 16. Gordon Sayre has completed a partial translation of Le Page du Pratz’s  L’Histoire de la Louisiane (1758), available online &lt;darkwing.uoregon. edu/~gsayre/LPDP.html&gt;. For more on Le Page d Pratz, see also Gordon Sayre,  “Le Page du Pratz’s Fabulous Journey of Discovery.” 17. For example, Bartram failed to understand the degree to which European  diseases actually caused many of the demographic disasters and population  movements among North American Indians that interested him. He also  62 </page> <page sequence="21"> South Atlantic Review downplayed (even ignored) the fact that the Yamasee War of 1715, inspired by  Euro-American imperial ambitions, contributed more to the destruction of  the Yamasee Indians than the Creek nation-building strategies that preceded  European arrival in the New World. In fact, we cannot really understand the  Creek effort of political unification apart from its colonial context. For more  details, see Marvin T. Smith, Peter H. Wood, Tom Hatley (Dividing Paths), and  Kathryn Holland Braund (Deerskins and Duffels). 18. In his biography of Ephraim Squier, Terry Barnhart argues that the archae- ology of the 1840s and 1850s laid the foundation for the modern anthropology  of the early twentieth century. Barnhart’s prologue provides a succinct sum- mary of the development of anthropology as a field. 19. For more on Linnaean thought and the Great Chain of Being, see Arthur O.  Lovejoy and Burt Kornegay. Like Foucault, Lovejoy describes a historical tran- sition (circa 1800) from the Enlightenment, with its mechanistic view of nature  as a machine, to the Romantic era, which developed a more organic vision of  nature as a plant or tree.  20. See Gordon Sayre, “The Mound Builders and the Imagination of American  Antiquity in Jefferson, Bartram, and Chateaubriand.” More recently, Erica  Hannickel has read Bartram’s descriptions of Indian mounds as evidence of a  deep political anxiety over the state of federalism in the new republic. 21. Dimock recasts American literature by reaching deep into the past of world  history to an era before “America” was coined as a term and the U.S. was found- ed as a nation. By setting American literature in the context of sweeping his- torical trends like the rise of Islam, Dimock’s “deep time” approach explodes  geographic boundaries and challenges conventional notions of historical pe- riodization. In a different contribution to the so-called “temporality turn” in  literary studies, Thomas Allen considers how nineteenth-century narratives  about U.S. national identity situate the nation in time. In short, Allen argues  that visions of U.S. nationhood have negotiated different conceptions of tem- porality; there is not, nor ever was, one homogenous national time, but rather a  heterogeneous variety of times. Whereas most of the recent work on temporal- ity has focused on the nineteenth century, Bartram was exploring alternative  versions of temporality and history during the late eighteenth century, fur- ther evidence to suggest that his work appeared on the verge of a momentous  change in cultural discourse. Bartram, in other words, gave voice to a kind of  “Indian time” in an effort to include native peoples in the complex variety of  temporal cultures circulating in the early Republic.
