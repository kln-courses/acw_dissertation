David Lewis-Williams1 2 and David G. Pearce1 Many aspects of southern African San rock art images can be understood in the light of nineteenth- and twentieth-century ethnography. San beliefs about different kinds of "rain-animals" and the secrecy that attended rain-control rites informed different kinds of social relations between rain-controllers themselves and between them and other people. San communities were less egalitarian than is often supposed, though on grounds that are commonly overlooked. These points are made in reference to a hitherto unknown painted site.

Today, some researchers seek "the individual" in the past. In specific terms, this is a misdirected search?it is seldom possible to "find" particular individ uals in the past (except in the historic period; see e.g., Johnson, 1989). The notion of individual agency is more useful. This is the idea that individuals were (are) socially active; they did (do) influence social relations. Such a concept provides a useful way of approaching the data with which this article deals. Im plicit in the archaeological application of this position is the assumption that the *Rock Art Research Institute, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. 2To whom correspondence should be addressed at Rock Art Research Institute, University of the Witwatersrand, Private Bag 3, WITS 2050, South Africa; e-mail david@rockart.wits.ac.za. 199 0263-0338/04/1200-0199/0 ? 2004 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">200 Lewis-Williams and Pearce influence of individuals is often accomplished through, and revealed in, material culture. Exemplifying the utility of this approach in a case study, we adopt Alfred Gell's view that image-making is a device "for securing the acquiescence of individuals in the network of intentionalities in which they are enmeshed" (Gell, 1992, p. 43). When San of southern Africa made rock art images they intended to accomplish certain ends, and those ends, amongst others, entailed other peoples' acquiescence in specific kinds of constructed social relationships. As we shall see, San image-making was, in Gell's phrase, "enchanted." To understand individual influence through material culture requires a change in the scale of analysis. Researchers can no longer study material at the industry or culture level (e.g., Parkington, 1992, 1993), as Mitchell and colleagues (1996) put it "different processes are most in evidence at different spatiotemporal scales"; they now need to abandon vague generalizations and focus on specific sites and subsections of sites. Adopting such a focus, we identify items of material culture (specific rock paintings) that San people used to negotiate power relations (cf. Blundell, 2004; Campbell, 1987; Dowson, 1994, 1995, 1998a). By identifying different categories of images, we are able to suggest the different types of so cial power in which they were implicated. In doing so, we describe from San ethnography relationships in which individuals establish, consolidate, and main tain personal social and political power (cf. Dowson, 1998a). If there were only a single isolated instance of this, it would be inconsequential. But when these types of practices recur and multiply they influence society more broadly: the actions of individuals, singly and without explicit co-ordination, become a pervasive social force. To illustrate these points, especially Gell's notion of "enchantment," we go beyond research that has established the general conceptual context of rain control images (e.g., Bleek, 1874; Lewis-Williams, 1981; Orpen, 1874; Vinnicombe, 1976). We explore ways in which individual San painters attempted to reproduce and subvert social relations by making images that were associ ated with rain-control rites and that embodied and projected both supernatural potency and social influence (cf. Dowson, 1998b). These images underwrite the unity of a highly complex panel, or cluster of images, in a recently lo cated site in the eastern Free State Province of South Africa, now known as MK1 (to protect the sites and in the interests of land-owners, the exact loca tions of South African sites that are not prepared for public viewing are not published) (Figs. 1 and 2). Few southern African panels of comparable size (ap proximately 130 cm by 70 cm) have so many crowded and diverse individual images with so many, meticulously painted details, dozens of them no larger than a pinhead (Figs. 3 and 4). Most intriguingly, our understanding is challenged by two types of hitherto unknown images: "aquatic" forms and "fragments of antelope."</page><page sequence="3">Southern African San Rock Painting as Social Intervention 201 Fig. 1.

SITE MK 1: KEY IMAGES We begin by elucidating some prominent images in the MK1 panel (Figs. 3 and 4): two quadrupeds of indeterminate species (and vestiges of a third) at the top; an antelope-like image; numerous eland antelope;</page><page sequence="7">Southern African San Rock Painting as Social Intervention 205 "fragments of eland"; a coiled serpent; "aquatic" images. Despite the apparent diversity of these paintings, there is a cognitive substrate that holds the panel together. Rain-Animals and Rain-Controllers Unlike the overwhelming majority of zoomorphic San images, the two in the upper part of the panel depict creatures of no identifiable species. The larger has white dots on its head, neck, body, and hindquarters. A third has been almost entirely destroyed by a clay swallows' nest; only its forelegs remain, also covered in white dots. A fourth example, slightly lower and to the right, looks rather different; at first one could take it to represent an antelope with its legs tucked beneath it, but closer inspection reveals nonrealistic features. It resembles an eland antelope, yet it has rows of tiny white dots on its head, neck, body, and hindquarters. Despite the deliberate blurring and mixing of species and the incorporation of nonrealistic elements, such images are among the best-understood components of San rock art. While one cannot rule for all unidentifiable zoomorphic images, those of the kind in MK1 are what the nineteenth-century /Xam San called lkhwa-ka xoro. This identification applies to both the chunky quadrupeds and the antelope like one. Information about San beliefs in the lkhwa-ka xoro first came to light on June 21, 1874, when Wilhelm Bleek showed /Han^kass'o, one of his /Xam teachers, a copy of a rock painting that Joseph Orpen had made in what is now eastern Lesotho (Bleek, 1874, p. 12; Lewis-Williams, 1980). Shortly thereafter, in 1875, Bleek received 42 copies, part of a collection that George William Stow had made in the same general area as that in which we located MK1. When he showed these copies (more skilfully made than Orpen's) to the /Xam people, they identified further depictions of the lkhwa-ka xoro, each in some ways unique but everyone representing the same concept (Stow and Bleek, 1930, plates 18, 24, 32, 34, 41, 42, 58, 67a). Briefly, ?khwa is the /Xam word for both water and rain; -ka is a suffix forming the possessive case; and xoro means a large animal like a cow or ox (Bleek, 1956, p. 260; the San of the MK1 area were familiar with cattle owned by Bantu-speaking farmers and possibly Khoe-speaking herders, and some groups eventually kept stock of their own [Loubser and Laurens, 1994, p. 100]). The word thus means "animal of the rain/water." !Khwa also appears in numerous /Xam tales as a supernatural being (Hewitt, 1986, pp. 65-89). The /Xam named kinds of rain and cloud after parts of an animal: columns of falling rain were called the rain's</page><page sequence="8">206 Lewis-Williams and Pearce legs, while wisps of cloud were known as the rain's hair; mist was said to be the rain's breath. Closely associated with the lkhwa-ka xoro were lkhwa-ka lgi:ten (sing. lgi:xa). We need to consider this phrase a component at a time. The first syl lable of lgi:xa, means supernatural potency, or energy; the second syllable, xa, is a suffix meaning "full of." A lgi:xa was thus a person who was full of, and was able to control, supernatural potency. (We use "potency" to mean supernatural energy, and "power" to refer to social relations.) In the Ju/'hoan language of the northern Kalahari, these people are known as nlom k"ausi (sing, nlom k"au). Nlom is the Ju/'hoan equivalent of the /Xam word !gi:, and k"au means "owner" or "possessor." Those who specialize in rain-control are known as nloi k" ausi. N/oi is their respect word for rain, !ga (Marshall, 1962, p. 352). A comparison of the southern nineteenth-century texts with twentieth-century research in the Kalahari shows that the ritual specialists of both regions entered an altered state of consciousness to perform the same tasks?rain-control, healing, controlling the movements of animals, seeing afar, travelling to distant parts of the country, fighting off malevolent spirits of the dead, transforming into animals, and climbing "threads of light" to the realm of God in the sky (Keeney, 2003; Lewis-Williams, 1981, 1992; Lewis-Williams etal, 2000). The southern San lkhwa-ka ?giiten said that they captured a lkhwa-ka xoro at night in a deep pool, led it across the countryside to the place where rain was needed, or to the top of a nearby hill, and then killed it so that its blood and milk fell as rain. In the MK1 panel, the anthropomorphic figure at the head of the largest rain-animal probably represents a lkhwa-ka lgi:xa who is attempting to control the creature (see also Lewis-Williams and Dowson, 1999, figure 45; Stow and Bleek, 1930, figure 67a; Vinnicombe, 1976, figure 24). The Bleek and Lloyd Collection suggests that /Xam rain-controllers were men, although women could be other kinds of ?guten. There is only one record of a female rain-controller, and that narrative is set in a mythical time, not the present (Bleek, 1936, pp. 135-141; Hewitt, 1986, p. 48). Both the nineteenth- and the twentieth-century San ritual specialists per formed their tasks, principally, during the course of a "healing," or "trance," dance, though they were also supernaturally active in more solitary circumstances and in dreaming (Lewis-Williams, 1981,1987). But, as Biesele (1993, p. 70) significantly notes, "Though dreams may happen at any time, the central religious experiences of Ju/'hoan life are consciously and, as a matter of course, approached through the avenue of trance." San altered states are induced by rhythmic driving and hy perventilation, not, at least today, by the ingestion of psychotropes (Biesele, 1978, 1993; Guenther, 1999; Katz, 1982; Keeney, 1999; Lee, 1968; Marshall, 1999, pp. 37-90; but see Dobkin de Rios, 1986; Winkelman and Dobkin de Rios, 1989). We believe that the San words ?gi:xa (/Xam) and nlom k"xau (Ju/'hoan) may be translated as "shaman" (Guenther, 1999, p. 7; Hewitt, 1986; Lewis-Williams,</page><page sequence="9">Southern African San Rock Painting as Social Intervention 207 1992); there is no San word for these ritual specialists that is common to all languages. Our employment of the central Asian Tungus word, now commonly used in other parts of the world, highlights fundamental similarities between the activities and beliefs of such ritual specialists in widely separated regions. Eland: A Polysemie Symbol Next, we turn to the depictions of eland (Taurotragus oryx). In addition to the prominent central painting, there are the remains of five other eland images. The eland is the largest and fattest of African antelope and the species that the San of many regions painted and engraved most frequently. The numerical prominence of eland was noted early on (Battiss, 1958, p. 61; Werner, 1908, p. 393). Later, quan titative studies confirmed this observation (Lewis-Williams, 1972, 1974, 1981; Maggs, 1967; Pager, 1971; Vinnicombe, 1976). By contrast, excavations have shown that the bulk of the San diet was made up of smaller animals and plant foods, not eland (e.g., Plug, 1997; Plug et al., 2003; Plug and Engela, 1992). The red body of the central image is clearly visible; its lowered head with a tuft of red hair on its forehead and horns can also be discerned. The image appears to have a second head, painted to give the impression that it is looking over its shoulder. Although this part of the panel is not well-preserved, it seems that a painter renewed the image by adding a second head after the first had faded. The white paint that was generally used to depict the belly, neck, and lower legs of eland has faded; white pigment is more fugitive than red. The fact that the white parts of the image have almost disappeared while those of other paintings in the panel are well preserved suggests that this eland was one of the first images to be madeatMKl. Both nineteenth- and twentieth-century San ethnography shows that the eland was a key, or central, symbol with multiple associations. It featured in girls' puberty rituals, boys' first-kill observances, marriage rites, and numerous myths (Lewis Williams, 1981, 1996, 1998; Lewis-Williams and Biesele, 1978; Vinnicombe, 1976). It was also believed to be the trickster-deity's favorite creature and to possess more potency than any other animal. As such, its potency was (and still is) greatly desired by San shamans. When out hunting, Ju/'hoan men use the respect word tcheni (dance) instead of n! (eland) (Lewis-Williams, 1981, p. 14). They thus say that they are hunting "dance" and, by implication, the potency activated in the healing dance. Sometimes, southern San painters mixed the blood of a recently killed eland in their paint (How, 1962, pp. 37-38; Jolly, 1986; Lewis-Williams, 1986). In this way, eland potency was stored in depictions of that animal. In the rock shelters, dancers could turn to these images to intensify their potency: the potency radiated from the image and into them. If "good" people touched a painting of an eland, they derived potency from it; but, if "bad" people touched it, they would adhere to</page><page sequence="10">208 Lewis-Williams and Pearce the image and eventually waste away and die (Lewis-Williams, 1986). San images were not made simply to be looked at; many were also reservoirs of potency on which shamans (and perhaps ordinary people as well) could draw by touching as well as by looking (cf. Laue, 2000, p. 49; Ouzman, 2001; Yates and Manhire, 1991). The posture of this MK1 eland is significant. While it is true that eland lower their heads for a number of reasons, painters frequently associated that posture with other features (emanations of blood and foam from the nose and mouth, erect hair, crossed legs) to indicate that the animal is dying. These images are also often accompanied by shamans in postures that suggest that they too are "dying," but in the San sense that they are entering an altered state of consciousness to perform their supernatural tasks (Katz, 1982, pp. 99-100). The San perceived an analogy between an eland in extremis and a "dying" !gi:xa, and frequently used this homology in the rock art (Dowson, 1988; Lewis-Williams, 1981, pp. 81, 91; Lewis-Williams and Dowson, 1999, pp. 50-53). Moreover, a dying eland is believed to radiate its potency, and Kalahari n/om k,fxausi like to dance next to the carcass of a recently killed eland because they believe the place to be redolent with potency (Lewis-Williams, 1981, p. 60; Lewis-Williams and Biesele, 1978). The MK1 paintings of eland, especially the one in a dying posture, were therefore telling embodiments of the potency on which much else in the panel depended. The eland was an important medium, a conductor of potency, through which a shaman could establish contact with the spirit world. Altered states of con sciousness made this relationship vitally real. Spirit eland are said to be attracted to the dance and to stand in the darkness just beyond the firelight (Lewis-Williams, 1981, p. 83). There is another component of the eland's polysemy that needs to be consid ered. In a /Xam myth, hunters kill what they believe to be an eland, but "[a]t that time the Rain was like an eland" (Lewis-Williams, 1981, p. 106; 2000, pp. 222 223). When they try to roast its meat, it evaporates, and they are terrified. "Then the Rain turned the men into frogs and they hopped away to the pond" (/Han^kass'o in Lewis-Williams, 2000, p. 223). An eland can thus itself be a rain-animal, even though it has no unusual features. In the Kalahari, this close association between eland and rain is reinforced by the existence of what the musicologist Nicholas England calls the "Rain-Eland Scale." He argues that it must "represent an old layer of Bushman musical culture, perhaps a very old layer indeed" (England, 1968, pp. 483-484; see also Marshall, 1999, pp. 81-82). Because this MK1 eland was painted before the rain-animals in the upper part of the panel, it was probably originally an embodiment of potency which shamans (of whatever speciality) could harness?as most eland images seem to be. Subsequently, after the rain-animals and other images had been added to the panel, the rain segment of the eland's polysemy may have been highlighted. In this way, painters manipulated the significance of already-existing images.</page><page sequence="11">Southern African San Rock Painting as Social Intervention 209 San rock art panels were thus semantically dynamic: they comprised inter image relationships that could be elaborated, refined, or added to over time as the social relations in which they were implicated changed. In this sense, no San panel was ever "complete." The forms in which they exist today were determined by the demise of viable San communities and their painting tradition. Fragments of Eland In addition to recognizable depictions of eland there are 16 images, some partially preserved, of a kind not previously noted. We call them "fragments of eland" (Figs. 3 and 4). They appear to depict the top parts of elands' heads with (fully visible in well-preserved instances) that species' pair of distinctive straight horns and tuft of red forehead hair (cf. the lowered head of the large eland and the remains of an eland image to the left of the rain-animals). There is also an isolated pair of eland horns in the upper left of the panel (Fig. 4a). This pair and others are painted in black, but some are depicted in white. There are, in addition, two therianthropic figures with eland horns on the right of the panel. A focus on a particular part of an eland is a feature of San rock art. Sometimes the dewlap is exaggerated to imply the presence of much fat and hence potency. We do not, however, know of any other depictions of isolated eland horns and forehead hair. Why would the MK1 artists paint such images? A possible answer is that the /Xam San believed that /Kaggen, the trickster-deity also known as the Mantis, sat in this hair on an eland's forehead, and painters took care to depict it. But eland horns have other significances. A newspaper report from 1851 claims that cattle rustling San, fleeing from the animals' Zulu owners "summoned a torrential downpour of rain by blowing a blast on an eland horn" (Vinnicombe, 1976, p. 44). This colonial report may not be as fanciful as it at first seems because the San did indeed associate horns with rain. The nineteenth-century Ju/'hoansi believed that /Xue, their trickster figure, could make rain and then cause it to disperse by singing and blowing on "a buck's horn" (Bleek, 1935a, p. 269). Then, too, Dia?kwain told Lloyd that women burnt horns so that "the smell of the horns should go up, so that the Rain should not be angry with them" (Bleek and Lloyd, 1911, p. 199). /Han^kass'o confirmed this: "They... burn the outer covering of horns, when they want the rain to disperse, when they see that the rain seems to be bringing danger... (Bleek, 1932, pp. 341-342; see also Marshall, 1957, p. 239; 1999, pp. 163-173). A clearer understanding of the significance of eland horns derives from a Ju/'hoan myth. G!ara, the Ju/'hoan trickster who is in some ways similar to the /Xam /Kaggen, hangs bones from the back of an eland's neck in a tree. They fall down. He then hangs up the horns instead, and they stay in place. He does this so that he can call lightning down on some lions who had killed his sons (Biesele, 1993, pp. 103-105). The tale incorporates beliefs about nlao, a complex that relates people to changes in the weather (Biesele, 1993, pp. 106-115; Lewis</page><page sequence="12">210 Lewis-Williams and Pearce Williams and Pearce, 2004; Marshall, 1957,1999, pp. 168-173). Biesele's reading of the tale is as follows: G!ara tries to resuscitate his sons after they have been killed by lions. He calls a dance for rain, then uses eland horns to summon lightning to strike the lions dead. To cleanse himself of the killing he makes a tortoise-shell medicine box [and places eland fat in it], sniffs smoke from it and goes into trance for the first time... To get rain and lightning, he hangs eland horns in a tree (Biesele, 1993, pp. 109, 110; parentheses added). The "cleansing" of which Biesele speaks is entering trance and curing oneself. Medicine smoke from a tortoise shell is used not only to enter trance and to cure, but also to prepare a man for hunting: the smoking tortoise shell "sends you to the animals" (Biesele, 1993, p. 93). A Ju/'hoan person added that G?ara's two sons were eland horns and that it was they who taught him to dance under the eland horns and enter trance. The medicine song on this occasion was "the song of the eland horns," and, as we have seen, it is related to the rain song: "The music works with the eland horns" (Biesele, 1993, p. 113; the importance of music and sound in rain-control is an issue that we do not develop, but see Ouzman, 2001). Eland horns are thus associated with rain, potency, and altered states of consciousness (for more on horns and rain see Marshall, 1999, pp. 166-177). One final point about eland horns needs to be mentioned. When /Kaggen was trying to enable an eland to escape from hunters who had wounded it with a poisoned arrow, he struck its horn: "[T]he Eland arises, the Eland eats, because it feels that it has come to life by the Mantis's [/Kaggen 's] doings, although it had nearly died" (Bleek, 1924, p. 12; parentheses added). This form of resuscitation is of interest because two figures near the rain-animal's head, one human and one "aquatic," seem to be reaching out to the creature with sticks (Fig. 3). Moreover, one of the "aquatic" figures to the left appears to strike with a stick the horns of a legless anthropomorphic figure, while it in turn strikes one of the coiled serpent's horns (Figs. 3 and 4a). Both these figures have red lines on their faces, an indication that they are lgi:ten (see below). It is possible that we have here a depiction of the transfer of potency and thus mutual support of life in the underwater realm that the rain-animal inhabits. As /Kaggen's striking of the wounded eland's horn raises it from death, so, too, Igiiten support each other and raise each other from the "death" of deep trance. All in all, we argue that the depiction of eland horns in a rain-control panel was probably implicated in rites, either to bring rain or to disperse a dangerous thunderstorm. Eland, their potency, horns, songs, altered states of consciousness, and, importantly, painted images were all closely related. A Coiled Serpent Just below the two prominent rain-animals is a depiction of a coiled snake, but it has an antelope head with two horns and white protrusions from its mouth</page><page sequence="13">Southern African San Rock Painting as Social Intervention 211 (Fig. 4a). In the south-eastern mountains, snakes, fantastic or realistic, account for only about 1% of zoomorphic images (Lewis-Williams, 1981, p. 135; Pager, 1971, p. 321; Vinnicombe, 1976, p. 364). None the less, snakes have rich associations in San thought; some of these link them to rain: The cobra, the puffadder, the tortoise (Testudo geom?trica) and the great water tortoise (Testudo leopardis) are things which the Rain puts aside as the Rain's meat. Therefore Bushmen fear them not a little. These are things which the Rain throws at us, because it is a strong thing (/Han^kass'o in Bleek and Lloyd, MSS L.VIII. 16.7431 rev.; parentheses in original; paraphrased in Bleek, 1933, p. 303). This statement refers to the San notion of possession (/ki), a key to under standing rain-animal (and other) paintings. Certain shamans were said to "possess" animals from which they obtained potency and which they controlled. The rain itself also "possessed" things, such as snakes, tortoises, and turtles. The implica tion here is that the rain was able to cause them to appear and disappear, even as /Xam "shamans of the game" (Qpwaiten-ka ?giiten) were supposed to cause antelope to run into the hunters' ambush. Snakes were said to appear after rain had fallen, which they in fact do. James Chapman, an early Western explorer who wrote about the semi-arid parts of southern Africa, said that snakes are so numerous that after a fall of rain, which succeeded a severe and long continued drought, the ground was covered with these venomous reptiles, so that (one) could hardly walk without treading on them (Chapman, 1868, pp. 2, 26; parentheses added; cf. Hahn, 1881, p. 77). Visually prominent amongst these species is the puffadder (Britis arietans arietans). They "may venture onto low shrubs and bushes to bask, especially after heavy rains when the ground is wet" (Marais, 1992, p. 41). An association between puffadders and rain was confirmed by a /Xam person, who said, "the puffadder is wont to become visible when rain falls" (Bleek, 1956, p. 653). The /Xam believed this connection to be a result of the species' "green/yellow" (/kai.n) color that resembles the rainbow (L.V6.4384 rev.). This connection led on to an association of the puffadder with the sky: "One of the rain's things it is. And one of the sky's things it is; that which is coming out of the sky it is" (L.V.6.4385 rev.). Orpen's nineteenth-century report takes us an important step further. In a San myth that he recorded in what is now eastern Lesotho mythical snake-people had the power to flood the country (Orpen, 1874, p. 5). In addition, Qwanciqutshaa, a mythical personage, was secretly fed snake fat. Fat was, and still is, believed to contain strong !gi:. As a result of the snake-fat !gi:, his food frustratingly dropped from his mouth. At his third attempt to eat the food and snake fat, "the blood gushed from his nose" (Orpen, 1874, p. 7). San shamans often experienced nasal haemorrhages when they entered a deeply altered state of consciousness (Arbousset and Daumas, 1846, pp. 246-247; Bleek, 1935b, pp. 12, 19, 20, 34;</page><page sequence="14">212 Lewis-Williams and Pearce Butler, 1997, p. 84; Lewis-Williams, 1981, pp. 78, 81, 83, 95-97; Orpen, 1874, p. 10). Nasal blood is frequently depicted in the rock art, sometimes as red lines on stylized human faces (e.g., Lewis-Williams and Dowson, 1999, figures 16, 17, 18, 19b, 22). Qwanciqutshaa then accomplished something that /Kaggen, himself the orig inal shaman, does in a number of /Xam myths (Lewis-Williams, 1996, 1997a): he tossed his weapons and clothes into the sky and then "threw himself into the river." Immersed in Ikhwa, he turned himself into a snake, another of /Kaggen's accomplishments (Bleek, 1924, p. 11; Orpen, 1874, p. 7). The important issue here is that snakes were associated in more than one way with water/rain and with certain altered states of consciousness. In both immersion and trance, subjects ex perience difficulty in breathing, a sense of floating in another world, sounds in the ears, affected vision, and eventual unconsciousness. Interconnected associations of this kind were a source on which rock painters drew in panel after panel, as, for example, by depicting fish next to trancing shamans. We can now discern two sets of parallels that structure aspects of San thought and art. First, San mythology is enacted in a three-tiered, though interdigitating, universe (Lewis-Williams, 1996, 1997a). Above, is a realm occupied by God and his animals and spirits of the dead; then there is the level on which material life takes place; below it is another spiritual realm associated with the dead and shamanistic travel. Snakes mediate this cosmos. In addition to being associated with the sky from which they were believed to fall, they live in holes in the ground and pass from one place to another by means of subterranean travel. Similarly, Ikhwa falls from the sky and wells up in waterholes. Secondly, shamans are believed to traverse the three tiers by entering waterholes (or by other means), moving through the subterranean and subaquatic realm, and emerging to climb "threads of light" to the realm in the sky (Biesele, 1979, pp. 56,61 ; Katz et ai, 1997, p. 113; Keeney, 1999, pp. 62, 105, 109; Lewis-Williams et al., 2000; Schapera, 1930, p. 198). In a number of ways, then, shamans behave like snakes, and/Kaggen, the first shaman, can turn himself into a snake. Shamans, snakes, and /Kaggen are thus all mediators of the three-tiered San cosmology. Aquatic Images We come now to the second kind of idiosyncratic element in the MK1 panel. These are 16 (including three poorly preserved examples in the lower part of the panel) elongated, slug-like figures with human torsos, arms, and heads (Figs. 3 and 4). Several of them hold out "sticks," or "paddles," toward the rain-animals. What especially characterizes them as a group is, however, their tapering "tails." Most (certainly the better preserved examples) have a white outline surrounding the tails. Three also have narrow black lines cutting across the white outline, sometimes extending beyond the border of the tail. One figure also has paired</page><page sequence="15">Southern African San Rock Painting as Social Intervention 213 Fig. 5. (a) Barbel (Ciar?as gariepinus) (after Le Roux and Steyn, 1968, p. 80). (b) Tadpole developing into a frog (after Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1967, plates VIII-IX). white protuberances around the mouth (as does the coiled snake and a legless anthropomorphic figure); others have one protuberance. A more consistent feature is red lines drawn across the face; at least nine have them. These tapering figures are clearly a conflation of human images and some other creature. They have several features that suggest that the nonhuman part of the conflation is something aquatic. Indeed, they may simply be meant to repre sent a generalized aquatic creature. On the other hand, the standardization of the depictions suggests that they may be modeled on a particular species. It is the researcher's task to attempt to identify that species, even if certainty cannot be achieved. The depictions of fish with which they are associated are no help (Figs. 3 and 4d). No two are alike. This vagueness may be accidental; we may simply be looking for the "wrong" identifying characteristics. There is also the possibility that the fish, like rain-animals, are a deliberate blend of a number of highly generalized species. If this is so, they (like the rain-animals) may not be "real," but rather spirit-world creatures encountered by lkhwa-ka !gi:ten. There are, however, two principal possibilities as to the creature that the tapering bodies suggest. A fish that in some ways resembles the depictions is the common barbel {Ciarlas gariepinus), a species abundant in the river adjacent to MK1. They are in some respects formally similar to the painted figures (Fig. 5a): They have elongated tapering bodies. The dorsal and anal fins do not join the caudal fin, but they are long, and terminate just short of the caudal fin. They have fleshy "barbels" that surround their mouths, similar to the white protuberances around the mouths of the conflated and other figures.</page><page sequence="16">214 Lewis-Williams and Pearce In addition to the morphological similarity of the barbel to the depictions, the species has an ability that may have suggested a relationship with rain-animals. Besides gills, it has an accessory breathing organ in the back of its head (Skelton, 1993, p. 227) that enables it to move over land after rain or when the grass is wet with dew (Skelton, 1993, p. 230). Just as the rain-animal comes out of the water hole so these atypical fish also come out of the water onto the land, and they do so at the same time as the rain-animal was believed to leave its pool, when it is raining. A second possibility is that the depictions are not ichthyoid at all, but rather allude to another aquatic creature?the tadpole and, by implication, frogs, another of the rain's creatures (Potgieter, 1955, p. 23). Tadpoles have elongated tapering bodies, continuous fin-like structures around their tails and, at some stages of development, fleshy pulps around the mouth (Fig. 5b). They therefore have some of the characteristics of the conflated figures. Eventually, they metamorphose from fish-like aquatic larvae to more terres trial frogs, in the process growing legs (not unlike the arms of the painted figures) and losing their tails. Indeed, transformation is a feature of the ontogeny of frogs. It is therefore significant that the images at MK1 have tadpole-like tails and bodies with arms where, at the transitional stage, a tadpole grows legs and turns into a frog (Fig. 5b). The location of transformation is also of importance. Water and water holes were agents of transformation and could cause, for example, an ostrich feather to grow into a complete ostrich (/Alkunta in Bleek and Lloyd, 1911, p. 137). Frequently, they were also the place where San shamans began their transcosmological journeys and where their transformations began. As we have seen, Ikhwa means both water and rain, a mediating substance that wells up in waterholes and falls from the sky. Waterholes were the central node of San cosmology. Given its transformative power, it is not surprising to find that Ikhwa had a dangerous aspect. If people offended the rain in some way, it turned them into frogs (Bleek, 1933, p. 299; Bleek and Lloyd, 1911, pp. 195, 203; Lewis-Williams, 2000, pp. 222-223). For instance, ?Kweiten ta//ken told how a girl killed the "rain's children." Because of her foolishness, a whirlwind came and took her and her family and deposited them in a waterhole where they became frogs (Bleek and Lloyd, 1911, pp. 199-204). Equally, if one kills frogs, one precipitates disaster: "A drought comes if we have killed frogs, and the rain does not fall, and the place becomes dry" (/Han^kass'o in Bleek, 1933, p. 301). Frogs and aquatic tadpoles were thus powerfully linked to rain and transfor mation. We therefore argue that, while barbel are possible referents, the tapering humanoid figures at MK1 more probably refer to shamans of the rain transformed by Ikhwa into partial tadpoles. At the same time, we acknowledge that their form may be a more general reference to subaquatic life.</page><page sequence="17">Southern African San Rock Painting as Social Intervention 215 Most importantly, we note that nine of them have red lines on their faces, a feature frequently found on depictions of ?giiten. As we have pointed out, these lines represent the nasal bleeding induced by San in altered states of consciousness. Associated as they are with fish, the figures are therefore probably engaged in subaquatic shamanistic activities related to the capture of the rain-animals around which a number of them are ranged. RAIN-CONTROL: SOME SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS Having elucidated some of the iconography of the MK1 panel, we now begin to enquire about the potential social impact of the images. Male and Female Rain The /Xam distinguished between two kinds of lkhwa-ka xoro, each of which represented a type of rain commonly experienced in southern Africa. A "rain bull" was the fierce, short thunderstorm, while a "rain-cow" was the gentler, soaking rain that often set in for some days (Lewis-Williams, 1981, pp. 103-104; see Marshall, 1962, p. 234 for identical Ju/'hoan beliefs). The /Xam texts do not always explicitly draw this distinction. Lloyd sometimes translated lkhwa-ka xoro as "rain-bull" (even though xoro does not, by itself, imply a specific sex) because the sex of the creature was implicit in the narrative or because subsequent discussion with the narrators led to this identification (Bleek and Lloyd, 1911, p. 193). Without the qualifiers gwai (male) or laiti (female) the phrase can equally refer to a rain-cow. The rain-bull thunderstorm was said to walk on its "legs" (distant columns of rain illuminated by the sun) across the countryside, renewing the parched land in some places but, significantly, skirting others. The /Xam thus perceived a need to control the passage of a storm so that it would bring rain to their own land. But a rain-bull can harm people by throwing its "things" at them or by striking them with lightning. It also destroys the people's frail shelters. //Kabbo, the Bleek family's oldest informant and a rain-controller (Lewis-Williams, 1981, p. 27), explained that people fear a rain-bull because they "think that the time of death must be come... they think the huts may be blown away" (Bleek, 1933, p. 308). The rain-bull was dreaded because of its violence, even though it brought welcome relief from drought; attitudes to rain-bulls were ambivalent. By contrast, the rain-cow was what people especially desired. This was the kind of rain that soaked in to the ground and renewed the whole face of nature. As //Kabbo said, "she will rain softly on the ground, so that it will be wet deep down in the middle. Then the bushes will sprout and become nicely green, so that the springbok come galloping" (Bleek, 1933, p. 309).</page><page sequence="18">216 Lewis-Williams and Pearce Now we examine crucial relationships between these two kinds of rain and lkhwa-ka Igi.ten (Dowson, 1998b, pp. 81-82). /Han^kass'o spoke about a Ikhwa ka !gi:xa named //Kunn, who was his grandfather. According to Lloyd, the old man died between 1870 and 1873, but, when /Han^kass'o was a child, he saw him and experienced his rain. /Han^kass'o said that "his rain came streaming from out of the west there, it went to the north, because he was from that part" (Bleek, 1932, p. 387; emphasis added). In another instance, /Han^kass'o said of another lkhwa-ka lgi:xa, "your rain feels that you do not speak hastily. Therefore, your rain leaves off thundering and falls gently" (Bleek, 1933, pp. 303-304; emphasis added). Both these statements imply that a rain-controller possessed a specific, recognizable rain and that it was sometimes associated with the part of the land where he lived. //Kabbo spoke of an old lkhwa-ka Igi.xa who seems to have had the power to kill either a rain-bull or a rain-cow, as he chose. But his preference was clear: "I think that I will cut a mother rain that has milk, she moistens softly, her wind blows gently. She rains gently, because her clouds are soft" (Bleek, 1933, pp. 308, 310). Although an association between a lkhwa-ka Igi.xa and a specific kind of rain was repeatedly confirmed, some rain-controllers were able to exercise a measure of choice in the matter. In view of the close association between a rain-controller and a particular rain, we conclude that, in many instances, a rain-controller was associated with, and in all probability actually made, a particular depiction of his own lkhwa-ka xoro. It does not follow that every painter was a Igi.xa, or that every !gi:xa was a painter. Nevertheless, rock painting was closely associated with Igiiten and the whole process of image-making was steeped in ritual (Lewis-Williams, 1995, 2001,2003). Rain-Control Locations Visiting between camps is a common feature of San life. Sometimes people undertook journeys to solicit the aid of a rain-controller. In one instance, people left early in the morning in order to reach the camp of a rain-controller (//Kabbo in Bleek, 1933, p. 307; see also Bleek, 1933, p. 382). Such journeys were drama tizations of the rain-controller's social influence: suppliants had to travel to him (Dowson, 1998b, p. 87). This point brings us to the location and physical nature of the MK1 site (Fig. 2). One rain-controller said that he would "ride the rain up the mountain on top of which I always cut the rain" (//Kabbo in Bleek, 1933, pp. 309, 310). "Always" suggests that this lkhwa-ka lgi:xa had a specific, remote place to which he went for his rain-control activities. Then, too, Di?lkwain spoke of rain-controllers killing and cutting up a rain-animal away from the camp; the rest of the people were at home. But they were watching the sky, and eventually saw that "the medicine</page><page sequence="19">Southern African San Rock Painting as Social Intervention 217 men really seem to have their hands upon the rain-bull, for you see the rain clouds come gliding" (Bleek, 1933, p. 377; in the phonetic transcription the sex of the rain-animal is not given). Later the rain-controllers returned to the camp. These reports raise questions about the locations of painted rain-animal sites. While numerous rain-animals are depicted in large sites where there are many other paintings, ample living space and evidence of occupation, MK1 is a small overhang set in a rocky bluff overlooking a substantial (at least in southern African terms) river. It is not the only !khwa-ka xoro site that overlooks a river or large pool. The small extent of the MK1 overhang (it is hardly a shelter) and its sloping rock floor mean that it could not have been a living site. More probably, it was the sort of site to which rain-controllers repaired when they wished to make rain out of sight. As such, it was probably believed to be invested with special rain-control potency, and hence social importance. If we add to this implication the presence of not one but four painted rain animals and the general intensity, exuberance and detail of the imagery, we con clude that MK1 was indeed a special rain-control location, a potent nodal point, to which rain-controllers went when they wished to capture a lkhwa-ka xoro (cf. Deacon, 1988; Ouzman, 1996, 1998). Each painted site was an element in a network of ritual locations that linked the various bands living in the extended landscape. Each site was probably seen and evaluated vis-?-vis other sites in terms of the people who occupied them. In this way, rain-control differed from other shamanistic activities, such as healing, that were conducted in the camp where everyone could watch or take part. Knowledge of spiritual things is often closely guarded and thus a foundation for social discrimination, but with the San it was not so much the knowledge itself that was secret (San shamans talk freely about their experiences in the spirit world) as the means of obtaining it?transcosmological travel by means of altered states of consciousness. By traveling into another realm, shamans had direct access to knowledge about rain-animals and rain-control procedures whereas everyone else could access that knowledge only through the shamans. It was access to knowledge rather than its content that mattered: "As a result of his mediating position with the spirit world, the shaman has power, privileges and position which are unavailable to anyone else" (Shennan, 2002, p. 224). Secrecy and association with a remote place probably contributed to the San's ambivalent attitude to rain-controllers and, as we now see, their positions of influence. RAIN-CONTROL, ROCK ART, AND SOCIAL INTERVENTION Many ethnographers present the San as determinedly egalitarian and contend that this proclivity has inhibited their assimilation into economies other than</page><page sequence="20">218 Lewis-Williams and Pearce hunting and gathering (e.g., Katz, 1982, p. 240; Lee, 1979, p. 24; 1982, p. 53). The same issue has formed the basis of a key debate current in Later Stone Age archaeology. Some writers contend that hunter-gatherer egalitarianism prevented them from acquiring livestock (e.g., Smith, 1986, 1990; Smith et al, 1991). Their opponents argue that this position is a misreading of the archaeological evidence: some hunter-gatherers did acquire livestock in addition to wild resources (e.g., Sadr, 1998, 2002). Some ethnographic writers take a less polarized view, and have concluded that the notion of hunter-gatherer egalitarianism is context-bound. 0rnulf Gulbrandsen (1991, p. 99), for example, identifies three conditions in which au thority figures are likely to develop: (a) when historical circumstances create communities significantly larger than a band, (b) when wide-ranging nomadism is restricted and people are confined to a site, and (c) when resource and social prob lems are created by external agricultural groups (see also, for example, Denbow, 1984; Gordon, 1984; Schrire, 1980; Wilmsen, 1989). Guenther (1999, p. 41) adds that, even under more "normal" conditions, San social organization leads "to the delineation of the individual as an exceptionally sharply profiled actor and agent." San egalitarianism has been defined as the ideology of equality. We respond that San egalitarianism is indeed ideological, but in the sense that it masks in equalities. Even the enquiries of Western ethnographers have been diverted by this ideology. They find no evidence for inequality in material wealth and overt political power but miss other kinds of inequalities that are embedded in differen tial access to levels of the tiered San cosmos. As Stephen Shennan (2002, p. 224; emphasis added) notes, "[A] key locus for the generation of social inequality in forager societies was the cultural transmission of ritual knowledge, even in the absence of material inequalities^ He emphasises that, in forager societies, the transmission of ritual knowledge may be "the only legitimate locus for the generation of inequality" (Shennan, 2002, p. 223). This seems to have been the case in San communities. In 1873, Qing, a young San man, told Orpen that certain things were "secrets that are not spoken of... [OJnly the initiated men ofthat dance know these things" (Orpen, 1874, p. 3). He was referring to the trance dance, paintings of which he had shown Orpen. But, as we have suggested, with the San it was the mode of access rather than the actual knowledge that was important, although certain aspects of the experience may well have remained secret. The psychological and somatic experiences of altered states of consciousness during transcosmological travel intensify social distinctions. Roy Rappaport (1999, p. 219) realized this: "The relationship between alterations of the social condition and alterations of consciousness is not a simple one, but it is safe to say that they augment and abet each other." (On altered states and social distinctions see Lewis-Williams, 1995, 1997b, 2002; Lewis-Williams and Dowson, 1993).</page><page sequence="21">Southern African San Rock Painting as Social Intervention 219 One of the San's "spiritual" grounds for inequality was their acceptance that rain-controllers influenced the fecundity of resources. Healers controlled productivity in that they alleviated physical ills and also "cleansed" hunters who had been long unsuccessful, but the power of rain-controllers went far beyond an ability to restore individuals to productivity. They controlled all resources: water itself, plant foods on which everyone principally depended, and animals that were attracted by the grass that sprang up after rain. They therefore exercised more power over more people than healers. Next, we note that, by the middle of the nineteenth century, the San of the eastern Free State had long been in contact with Bantu-speaking farmers and cattle-owners, and that their territory was being swiftly eclipsed by the advance of the colonial frontier (Jolly, 1996; Loubser and Laurens, 1994). Farther to the south, along the southern edge of the escarpment, San made rain for neighbor ing Bantu-speaking chiefs, and were paid for their services in cattle (Barry, 1883; Campbell, 1987; Dowson, 1998b; Hook, 1908, p. 327; Jolly, 1986; Lewis-Williams and Pearce, 2004; Saunders, 1977, p. 146; Stanford, 1910, p. 439; Vinnicombe, 1976). They, and probably those in the eastern Free State as well, were living in conditions that Guldbrandsen identifies as conducive to the emergence of authority figures (cf. Blundell, 2004; Campbell, 1987; Dowson, 1994, 1995, 1998a). Un der comparable circumstances, twentieth-century Nharo San healers in Botswana became itinerant, moving between communities settled on white-owned farms. It was these healers who emerged as Nharo political leaders: there was "differenti ation and professionalism in the status and role of the trance dancer" (Guenther, 1999, p. 246, see also Guenther, 1975-1976; Lee, 1993, p. 123). As Lee (1993, p. 123) notes, there has been a shift from the rewards of "personal satisfaction, the love and respect of family, and the gratitude of those they had 'saved' to more tangible rewards." Some healers deplore this change. They realize that freely given healing was for all; once it is paid for, it becomes the property of the one who paid, and the healers can no longer bestow their powers as they please; they are bound to those who can pay. Differentiation that can change from prestige to material reward is embedded in traditional San belief and society. It can, especially, but not necessarily, in circumstances such as those Gulbrandsen notes, grow into political leadership. The origin of San social differentiation and leadership lies in their recognition of different degrees of the effectiveness and stature among shamans, even if they are not paid for their services: Bushmen know particularly big (n!a n!a, big, big) medicine men by their reputation; they call them gaoxa (chief) and fear and respect their powers even though the medicine men dress, eat, sleep, and otherwise pursue their lives just as any other member of the community (England, 1968, p. 416; parentheses in original). Here, England refers to the mid-twentieth-century Kalahari Ju/'hoansi, but the Bleek and Lloyd Collection confirms the presence of similar sentiments among the</page><page sequence="22">220 Lewis-Williams and Pearce nineteenth-century /Xam. Theirs was not a stratified, hierarchical society, but there were social distinctions founded on differential access to the spirit realm. /Xam shamans, we are told, "are not like other people" (Bleek, 1936, p. 14) and their names were not to be spoken at night (Bleek, 1935b, p. 14). They were even be lieved to have powers to take a person and enslave him or her (Bleek, 1935b, p. 20). How may rock art have been implicated in such circumstances? Rock art images were made by individuals?or by a couple of co-operating individuals. They were not made by "society." Yet they were intelligible to many people: how else can we account for the broad uniformities of San rock art? There were con ventions as to what could be painted and what was unsuitable for depiction, though from time to time we find images that seem to break the rules. Indeed, in every panel of some size, there is a subtle interplay between normative and idiosyncratic contributions. Here, on the rock face, is the classic dichotomy between society and the individual, structure, and agency. Images of rain-control provide a useful arena for investigating this dichotomy. Mindful of the corroborative nineteenth- and twentieth-century San ethnog raphy that we have cited, we accept that there is a recursive relationship between, on the one hand, learned "structures" of belief and, on the other, individual ac tions. People understand the rules and manipulate them. Rules are enabling as well as constraining. The individual agent thus has the choice of either reproducing received structures or subverting them in deliberately chosen ways; structures are not immutable. San rock art images are the results of the conscious strategies of individuals (or small groups). When a San painter prepared to make an image (part of a complex chain of socially situated operations; Lewis-Williams, 1995, 2001, 2002, pp. 156-161), he or she was not simply constrained by received conventions. Those conventions also enabled him or her to make personal interventions. We thus adopt a conflictual, rather than consensual, view of society. To be sure, San shamans and painters were serving their communities, but they were also using that service, as it were, to jostle for position. The actions of San painters and rain-controllers were set in a political matrix that doubtless changed over time. We can now see why paintings of rain-animals, while recognizable as such, are almost always in some way idiosyncratic (cf. Dowson, 1998b). Crucially, we can enquire about the relations between specific rain-controllers and specific images of rain-animals. We argue that each lkhwa-ka Igi.xa who could paint could point to a depiction in his rock shelter and say, "That is my lkhwa-ka xoro. That is what / see when I make rain for you," even as he was known to possess a certain kind of rain. The painted image was a manifestation, an embodiment, of his particular rain-animal, sometimes, but not always, located in his living space. This is why there are often only one or a few, frequently large and prominent, rain animals in a rock shelter, whereas there are large numbers of depictions of eland. It is as if one could not have too many potency-filled eland in one's rock shelter, but, in the nature of relationships between rain-shamans and their own particular rain, one image (or very few) per rain-controller was all that was necessary.</page><page sequence="23">Southern African San Rock Painting as Social Intervention 221 The next point is that some painted rain-animals are clearly male, while others are female or (at least to our eyes) of indeterminate sex. Given the potential danger of rain-bulls and the beneficial qualities of rain-cows, each painting was a personal statement of a particular kind of social status: some lkhwa-ka Igiiten were feared for their ability to send destructive rain, others were admired for their soft, soaking rain (Dowson, 1998b, pp. 86-87). We thus have in each rain-animal image a clue to the specific kind of relation ship that a given lkhwa-ka Igiixa had with his people. Some maintained their status by threatening to send a destructive thunderstorm and by being associated with a depiction of a rain-bull, while others were overtly benevolent and associated with a painted rain-cow. People therefore feared some rain-controllers but admired others, though all demanded a measure of respect if they were to make rain when asked. Sometimes, however, there is more than one rain-animal painted in a rock shelter, as is the case at MK1 (e.g., Woodhouse, 1992, figures 6, 8,30,31,53,132). What kinds of social relationships are thus suggested? There are three possibilities: single ownership, co-operation, and competition. First, we allow that a rain-controller may have exercised mastery over more than one image. It seems possible that some exceptional sites that have up to five large and very similar rain-animals may have been the preserve of a rain controller who owned not just one rain-animal but a small herd of them. Multiple images probably signalled extreme power and potency. They may have drawn a parallel with neighboring Bantu-speaking farmers for whom the size of a herd was indicative of wealth and influence. Secondly, some passages in the Bleek and Lloyd texts suggest another explanation?co-operation. Di?ikwain said that people ask "the medicine men" to capture a rain-animal and to cause rain to fall (Bleek, 1933, pp. 375, 376; emphasis added). Indeed, some rock paintings show a number of men surrounding, leading, or driving a rain-animal (e.g., Lewis-Williams, 1981, figure 38; Lewis-Williams and Dowson, 1999, figures 43, 44, 45; Vinnicombe, 1976, figures 24, 240). On such occasions, "A man who is an old (Ikerri) rain medicine man and knows how people work with the rain-bull will lead, the men whom he teaches will follow" (Di?ikwain in Bleek, 1933, p. 379). Although Lloyd translated Ikerri here as "old," the word is given elsewhere as "great" and "large" (Bleek, 1956, p. 422). It was, as the /Xam speaker himself allowed, a socially powerful man who led the expedition to catch a rain-animal. He could assemble a small band of apprentices who were in the process of acquiring their own rain-animals (see also Bleek, 1933, pp. 376, 377, 387). It is therefore possible that those rock shelters that have a couple of painted rain-animals were used by co-operating rain-controllers and that the small group of images helped to consolidate a rain-control fraternity vis-?-vis the rest of the community. Thirdly, we note that amicable co-operation was not characteristic of all such activities. Di?ikwain described how a small band of rain-controllers returned to</page><page sequence="24">222 Lewis-Williams and Pearce camp empty handed because, so they said, the thong that they had thrown over the rain-animal's horns had broken and the creature had escaped (Bleek, 1933, p. 380). One rain-controller had remained in the camp for unstated reasons, though it seems that personal animosity was to blame. When the others returned, he scolded the Ikerri leader: Had he not known that it was a fierce bull? It was not a weakling, it was strong. Therefore he ought to have taken a really strong thong. He has acted like a child, though he told me that he had been a rain medicine man, that was why I wanted to see whether he had told me the truth, when he said that he had been a rain medicine man... It is now clear that he is not a rain medicine man (Bleek, 1933, p. 381). The rivalry that is evident here was, we argue, sometimes expressed in the paintings. In some rock shelters there are two depictions of rain-animals, one of which is conspicuously larger or more elaborate than the other. This contrast is explicable by the concept expressed by Ikerri. A lkhwa-ka lgi:xa who wished to assert his superiority could paint a larger or more elaborate, perhaps more fearsome, lkhwa-ka xoro. This social challenge could have been expressed while his rival was still alive and present or after he had died or had left the rock shelter to take up residence elsewhere. (San rock paintings were not deliberately defaced or erased; their intrinsic potency forbade such action.) In some instances, a less elaborate rain-animal is more faded than a more recent one (Dowson, 1998b, p. 87, figure 5.6a). Here we may have an instance where, some while after a rain controller had died and his rain-animal had faded, another took possession of his rock shelter and asserted his presence by painting a visibly more Ikerri depiction of his rain-animal. DIFFERENTIATING ENCHANTMENT We can now begin to tease out different sorts of responses to paintings of rain-animals. As Giddens (1987, p. 215) remarks, "signification is presumed to be saturated in the settings of practical action." Meaning is generated in a time/space context. In the first place, the painted image probably impacted on the painter himself. It derived from a vision and contributed to the induction of similar visions: people in altered states of consciousness tend to hallucinate what they expect, or hope, to see (though this is, of course, not always the case). Biesele writes of the Ju/'hoansi: Initiates have certain experiences in trance because they expect to do so, basing their expectations on other accounts they have heard ... The hallucinations of actual nlomkxaosi become, by a process at once highly individual and highly social, conventionalised vehicles facilitating trance for the uninitiated (Biesele, 1993, pp. 72, 76).</page><page sequence="25">Southern African San Rock Painting as Social Intervention 223 Similarly, we argue that there was a loop of reciprocal confirmation and in creasing strength between images and experiences. As Biesele says of verbally re ported hallucinations, painted hallucinations probably facilitated entry into trance and informed the visions of rain-controllers and novices. In the social matrix, painters asserted their status: their painted rain-animals made statements about their relations with other people, whether those relations were benign or minatory. Every time a rain-controller drew attention to his painted rain-bull, either in a living or in a secluded site, he was asserting his power to destroy as well as to provide beneficial rain. Images concentrated in sites that were not living areas, such as MK1, may not have been seen by many people, but everyone would have been aware that the lkhwa-ka ?gi.ten had their rain-animals in those locations. We re-emphasize that rain-control differed from other shamanistic activities, such as curing, which were conducted in full view in the centre of a camp: rain-controllers "went out" to make rain. We argue that the small, rocky MK1 overhang was not a living site but rather a place to which rain-controllers went to conduct their rituals. Even within living sites, there seems to have been a measure of exclusion. In the 1980s, a very old woman of mixed San and Nguni descent who lived to the south of the Drakensberg escarpment said that her father had been a rain-controller and a painter at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth (Jolly, 1986; Lewis-Williams, 1986). She was a member of a San rain-controlling family that had set up an alliance with neighboring black farmers and enjoyed the protection of a local chief. She took her interlocutors to the rock shelter where she and her family had lived and showed them her father's paintings. In the shelter, she claimed that painting had been her father's "secret." She and her elder sister were never allowed to watch him paint. Late in his life, her father had, however, explained some of the paintings to her, and her sister had eventually inherited his rain-control powers but not his painting ability; amongst Nguni farmers, women are more likely to become ritual specialists than amongst the San. Their father's secretiveness, even in a living site, suggests that his knowledge and paintings were a source of power and influence that he wished to retain for himself. Personal influence probably lay behind the making of the idiosyncratic aquatic figures at MK1, for they add a (as far as we know) unique element to the panel. The uniqueness of these images gives MK1 a special status vis-?-vis other sites in the region. The rain-controllers who were associated with?and probably made?the aquatic images provided an especially vivid and highly id iosyncratic realization of events in the subaquatic spirit realm. And then if we factor in the meticulous care with which the MK1 images are painted, the minute ness of details such as the dots, fins, blood lines on the faces, and protrusions at the mouth, we have a congeries of images that must have had considerable impact on the original viewers, whether they were themselves rain-controllers or ordinary San people.</page><page sequence="26">224 Lewis-Williams and Pearce What gave San rock art images this sort of impact? The efficacy of agency is a complex issue (Gell, 1998). Here, we recall that rain-animal images were probably not merely "pictures": rather, they were manifestations, reifications, of rain-controllers' visions, and touching them was to be done circumspectly (Lewis Williams and Dowson, 1990). As such, they would have been respected, perhaps as much as the rain-animal itself was respected. Sometimes they emerge through cracks and steps from behind the "veil" of the rock face, even as water itself seeps through bedding and joint planes (Lewis-Williams and Dowson, 1990); they were a constant reminder that the spirit world with its fearsome inhabitants was close at hand. If the wrong sort of person were to touch a painting of a rain-bull or not to respect it, it is likely that he or she would suffer in the same way that a bad person who touched a painting of an eland would adhere to the rock and eventually die (Lewis-Williams, 1986). The spirit world was real and, thanks to the painters, visible and tangible. Writing about what he calls "enchantment," Gell (1998, p. 68) remarks, "The 'coming into being' of these objects is explicitly attended to, because their power partly rests on the fact that their origination is inexplicable except as a magical, supernatural, occurrence." The intense reality of "non-reality" was a key compo nent of the complex way in which San rock art images did not merely reflect but also constituted social relations.
