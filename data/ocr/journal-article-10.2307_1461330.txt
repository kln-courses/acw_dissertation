By JAMES LUTHER MAYS. Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1969. ix + 190 pages. $6.00. James L. Mays's commentaries on Amos and Hosea represent a nice com- bination of readability, well balanced presentation of modern scholarship in biblical studies, and occasional thought- provoking theological comment. Be- hind his work lies the tradition of Ger- man scholarship with its outstanding, though now overplayed results in form- critical studies. Amos is pictured in a way which is both relevant to our current cultural, social and political crisis and appropri- ate to the text: "Next time the fire!" Through an overpowering experience of the word of YHWH as his vocation, Amos understands Israel's salvation- history to be ended. The future of the people, represented by leaders who op- press the poor and the innocent, is a funeral. The true history for Amos is YHWH-history, who is revealed in the exodus as Lord of the nations. Israel, the nation-state and the "my people"</page><page sequence="2">394 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF RELIGION of the covenant league, is not indis- pensable to this history. In his critical analysis of the text, Mays follows a well traveled path for the most part, although he occasionally argues against or goes beyond views that have gained popular support among some scholars. He sees no need to "construct a cultic ritual situation or background for the announcement of [the oracles against the nations, 1:3-2: 16]" (p. 27), since Amos employs here a traditional prophetic judgment form. In commenting on 3:1-2, he separates 3:2a ("You alone have I known/from all families of the earth") from the total range of Amos's representation of the exodus. "In the light of 9:7, which ranges the Exodus along with the im- migrations of other peoples, the Exo- dus as Yahweh's deed cannot be syno- nymous with the exclusive relation de- scribed in 2a" (p. 55). He makes skillful use of the studies of lamenta- tion and dirge forms published in the last few years (see commentary on 5:1-2; 5:12-13; 16-17; 5:18; 6:1). Hosea emerges in Mays's depiction as a mediator par excellence between visionary word and present actuality. The author's foci in interpreting Hosea are well stated in his introduction: "his dialogue with the fertility religion of Canaan, the freedom with which he theologizes by use of metaphorical images, and his knowledge and use of history as a source of meaning" (p. 8). A good perspective on the prophet and the book is attained through reflection on Hosea's expression of "the tension between Yahweh's anger at Israel's re- bellion and passion for reconciliation which breaks out into agonizing strug- gle with himself" (p. 14; see commen- tary on 11:8 and 13:14). However, in light of this divine passion, Mays's translation of mepatteh in 2:14 (Heb. 2:16) as "entice" is somewhat cau- tious; pittah here clearly signifies "se- duce" or "adduct" (A. Heschel; J. Ward). By way of criticism, I would mention that the criteria for distinguishing pri- mary from secondary passages are often extremely tenuous, as are criteria for textual emendations. For example, of Amos's oracles against the nations, Mays considers the ones against Judah, Edom, and "probably Tyre" to be later additions (pp. 25f; 33-36; 40-42). Compare the different position of J. M. Ward, Amos and Isaiah: Prophets of the Word of God (New York-Nash- ville: Abingdon Press, 1969), pp. 93- 99. Likewise, it is questionable whether all the references to Judah in Hosea can be considered additions and re- visions (p. 16 and commentary), espe- cially since Judah is included in an indictment or decree of judgment in some cases. To turn to some less discussed issues, I would question first whether "most of the primary issues about the mean- ing of Amos's theology will depend upon the settlement of literary-critical and form-critical questions about the text of Amos" (Amos, p. vii). Has not the significance of form-criticism be- come an orthodox conviction, leading to a self-perpetuating tradition in bibli- cal studies? I fail to see what differ- ence form-criticism may make to the heart of Amos's theology, "election to judgment" (3:1-2) and the "freedom of Yahweh" (9:7-8), or could add to "your future is a funeral" (5:12-13, 16-17). At any rate, form-criticism</page><page sequence="3">396 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF RELIGION should be applied within the context of fully developed hermeneutical reflec- tion. The work of such men as Eric Voegelin and Robert Funk may here provide some clues. And even though I find the studies of the Pannenberg circle inadequate to our cultural crisis and inappropriate to Scripture, I must admit that they present interpretive principles with which one can deal. Second, we now have or soon will have good interpretations of recent vintage on Amos and Hosea in English (Amos: Mays, Ward, Freedman; Ho- sea: Mays, Ward, Buss, Brueggemann). It seems to me, we need further devel- opment of insights that say to any audience that will hear, "Look, you haven't really considered the options until you listen to Amos and Hosea." The youth want to hear, in clear un- vacillating words, Mays's "Never on Sunday" (commentary Amos 8:4-8). Such remarks by Mays as YHWH's "feeling" his way into response to his creatures, Amos, p. 130) or the tension within YHWH (Hosea, p. 14), cry out for theological reflection. Both the perspective of Jungian psychology and the work of process philosophers and theologians would be appropriate here. Concerning the latter, why should they be ignored while German thinkers are looked to as theological guides? If we listen to mentors like Whitehead and Hartshorne, and their pupils such as Pittenger, Ogden, and Cobb, we are forced to ask whether "anthropomorph- isms" must be reevaluated (see Amos, pp. 129f; Hosea, pp. 151, 157). What if we were to understand the reality symbolized by YHWH/Elohim not as the Great Exception to what we feel and know, but the fulness of all that is and more; not as the "beyond" with respect to personal being (which means: the Alien One), but as the chief exemplification of personal be- ing? Such a view is not only appro- priate to Scripture, but might receive a hearing from the "under thirty" group which would surprise us. Finally, I am becoming more and more conscious that we are neglecting the work of Jewish scholars. Here I think especially of Buber, Heschel, and Kaufmann. They represent perspec- tives and Jewish commitments with which the reading public of the Old Testament Library should certainly be familiar. These criticisms are not intended to pan Professor Mays, his mentors and peers, but are suggestions for building on the solid work that he and others have achieved. Mays's commentaries are helpful guides into Amos and Hosea. JAMES G. WILLIAMS Syracuse University</page></plain_text>
