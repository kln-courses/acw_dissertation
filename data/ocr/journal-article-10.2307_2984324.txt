PLACKETT University of Newcastle upon Tyne [Read before the ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCETY, at a meeting organized by the Research Section, on Wednesday, October 16th, 1968, Professor P. ARMITAGE in the Chair] SUMMARY An asset generates profits of random amounts at random points in time. We discuss the distribution theory of total profits for a given period under discounting and reinvestment. The problem of replacement is also con- sidered. An application of the results is made to Premium Savings Bonds. 1. INTRODUCTION THE purchase of an asset by capital expenditure is a common activity for both private individuals and public corporations. Many individuals buy both a house and a car, while large companies are responsible for projects such as the construction of an oil refinery or the development of a copper mine. Both can buy securities in the stock market. An asset may generate either profits or losses and at any time subsequent to purchase it has a residual value different in general from the purchase price. When profits are generated, they can be directed to another part of the business, or ploughed back to increase the rate of generation. At the other extreme a motor vehicle generates losses and depreciates in value but is, nevertheless, described as an asset because of convenience or prestige considerations. In all cases the question of replacement eventually arises and the answer will be decided by taking account of the residual value of the asset and both current and potential levels of profits or losses. The financial aspects of capital investment from the viewpoint of a business economist have been comprehensively examined by Merrett and Sykes (1963), and again (1966) with a different emphasis. Methods of investment appraisal such as the present value of discounted cash flows and the internal rate of return are compared, but although the need to assess investment risks in terms of probability is recognized Merrett and Sykes, (1963, Ch. 6; 1966, Ch. 5), no theoretical studies are made. More attention is given to this question in the survey by Moore (1966), since when Wagle (1967) has further considered the application of discounting when the cash flows are random variables. Perhaps the first application of stochastic models in business is the theory of collective risk, originated by Lundberg, which has lately been surveyed and extended by Borch (1967). In the case of positive risks, the capital of an insurance company is described by a stochastic process, the main features of which are a constant inflow of premiums, a compound Poisson process of claims, and an absorbing barrier when the capital is zero. The complementary model for negative risks applies when the company deals with annuities, and there is then a constant outflow of payments and a compound Poisson process of purchases. A recent development is the introduction of a reflecting barrier forming an upper limit to the capital, any excess being paid out as dividends or taxes. The problems are to find the probability that the company is solvent for a given period, or for ever, the expected life of the company, and the expected discounted value of dividend payments.</page><page sequence="2">2 PLACKETT - Stochastic Models of Capital Investment [No. 1, A modification of the collective risk model is proposed by Steindl (1965, Ch. 3) to describe the firm as a stock of capital, but he points out that economic realism leads to great analytical difficulties and eventually he takes over the standard model for negative risks. There is now a constant outflow of capital due to the cost of the business, a compound distribution of profits from sales, and an absorbing barrier when the capital reaches some positive level. He obtains the probability distribution of capital at a given time and shows that the distribution tail has Pareto form. Capital investment generally involves problems of great complexity and it is necessary to discuss simplified stochastic models in order to make theoretical progress. We can dispense with the barriers of risk theory because ruin is not a relevant concept, and the possibility of an infinite growth of capital can be removed by discounting. A constant outflow of costs can be ignored in a preliminary analysis on the grounds that they are taken up by common resources or eliminated in a comparison between assets. Under these conditions we obtain the distribution of discounted profits and discuss the situation where the rate at which profits arise depends on the capital, a question mentioned by Steindl (1965) as leading to analytical complications. Recent work on replacement is examined and we conclude by applying some of the results to Premium Savings Bonds. 2. DISTRIBUTION OF DIscouNTED PROFITS At epochs ti, t2, ..., tw, ... following the initial outlay, a sequence of capital changes is generated, either all positive (profits) or all negative (losses), both types being described as gains. A mixture of positive and negative gains requires special attention when discounting (Duguid and Laski, 1964). The epochs where gains arise are assumed to follow a time-dependent Poisson process, because this is a flexible concept and known to be approximately correct in some practical applications. The probability rate of gain generation is denoted by a(t), and a variety of formulations may be relevant in different circumstances: (i) a(t) = ce, where oa ( &gt; 0) is related to the original capital; (ii) ox(t) = ae4n, appropriate for a steady fall in the generation of profits as the asset becomes obsolescent; (iii) oa(t) = a(1 - e-t), corresponding to a steady rise in losses as repair costs increase. We now consider positive gains and assume that each profit X has a probability distribution which is the same at any epoch where a profit occurs. Suppose first that X has a discrete distribution and is measured in integral multiples of some convenient unit such as ?25 or ?1000. Let the individual probabilities be {f1} and denote the probability generating function (p.g.f.) by +(s). Since a profit is positive if it occurs, fo = 0 and thus +(s) = fiSf2s2+.... The possibilities include taking +(s) = sa(s) where a(s) corresponds to any standard distribution on the non-negative integers. For a time-dependent Poisson process with rate of occurrence a(t), the number of epochs in (0, -r) at which profits arise has a Poisson distribution with parameter A, where A = (u) du, (1)</page><page sequence="3">1969] PLACKETT - Stochastic Models of Capital Investment 3 known as the operational time. Hence the profits Yreceived in (0, r) have a compound Poisson distribution with probabilities {pj} given by the p.g.f. ri(s) = exp [A{+(s) - 1}]. (2) A detailed study of the distribution arising when only f1 and f2 differ from zero has been made by Kemp and Kemp (1965), who give further references to compound and generalized distributions. Apart from such special cases, and the value po= e-A= no explicit expressions are available for the probabilities {pj}. Equating coefficients of powers of s in rT'(s) = AO'(s)IT(s), we obtain the recursion formula Pj+1 = A(JjP + 2f2pjl + 3f3Pj-2+ .. .)/(j+ 1) (j&gt; 0). (3) This method can be generalized to continuous variables, as follows. When X is measured on a continuous scale, letf(x) be its probability density function and m(w) the corresponding Laplace transform. Proceeding as before, the profits Y received in (0, -r) have a compound Poisson distribution with Laplace transform b(w) = exp [A{m(w) - 1}]. (4) Denote the corresponding distribution function by H(y). Then H(O) = po and h(y) = H'(y) exists for y &gt; O. For example, when X has an exponential distribution with density f(x) = Oe-Ox the density of Y can be expressed as h(y) = (AO/y)l e-A-Oy I1{2(A0y)i}, where I&amp;() is a Bessel function with imaginary argument (Cox, 1962, Section 8.3). In general, by analogy with the discrete case, we apply the inversion formula to b'(w) = Am'(w) b(w), and obtain the integral equation yh(y) = A po Yf(Y) + fxf(x) h(y - x) dx . (5) A computer program for solving this equation was tested on the exponential distri- bution and the results were satisfactory. The program is based on the recursion formula for a discrete distribution and starts from the value h(O) = Apof(O). In some applications, the integral equation gives h(y) directly for an interval O &lt;y &lt; c and values of h(y) for y &gt; c are then obtained numerically. When o(t) and m(w) are fixed, the compound Poisson distribution tends to normality as --&gt; oo0. However, these are not the conditions that seem appropriate in some applications. The distribution of X may be concentrated so close to the origin</page><page sequence="4">4 PLACKETT - Stochastic Models of Capital Investment [No. 1, that even if A is large there are marked departures from normality. In such cases another limiting form is relevant and it can be derived as follows. We make three assumptions. (i) The distribution of profits has gamma form with a small value for the shape parameter so that m(w) = (1- W)-% (6) where 8 is a fixed scale parameter. In the limit as X 0 from above, the distribution tends to a spike at the origin. (ii) The mean number of profits in (0, r) is large, either because ot(t) or r or both quantities are large. In the limit, A -e-oo. (iii) The limits in (i) and (ii) are approached in such a way that AXj tends to a finite value ,u &gt; 0. Under these conditions A{(1 - Sw)fl- 1}-,u- log(l - Sw). The limit of the Laplace transform (4) is therefore b(w) = (I1- w)-/ (7) which corresponds to a gamma distribution with scale parameter 8 and shape parameter It. The corresponding argument for a discrete distribution of profits will not be quite so obvious because the profits take values on the positive integers, but should all approach zero when the limit is taken. There seems no call for technical details, and the appearance of a negative binomial distribution in the limit would represent an appropriate analogy to the continuous case. Consider now the effect of discounting the value of future profits. For a time- dependent Poisson process with rate a(t), given that n profits occur in a period of duration , the epochs of occurrence T1, T2, ..., T. are independently distributed with density +(x) = a(x)/A (O &lt; x &lt; T) (cf. Cox and Lewis, 1966, Section 3.3). However, the present value of an amount X received at time T is given by U = Xe-rT, where r is a discount rate. Let n(w) be the Laplace transform of the distribution of U. Then the present value V(r) of all profits received in (0, -r) has a compound Poisson distribution with Laplace transform c(w) = exp [A{n(w) - I}J. (8) The density of U can be derived by standard methods from those of X and T. Once obtained, it can be inserted in the integral equation in place off(-), and the corre- sponding density h(-) then refers to the distribution of present value V(r). A special case of the expression for c(w) was derived by Dall'Aglio (1964). He studied the present value of a renewal process when each replacement has unit cost, and showed that if the interval between renewals has finite moments then V(r) is asymptotically normal as r-&gt; 0.</page><page sequence="5">1969] PLACKETT - Stochastic Models of Capital Investment 5 Let K be the initial capital outlay and S(r) the discounted residual value of the asset at the epoch r. The net present value of the investment over the period (0, T) is N(r) = V(r)+S(r)-K, (9) and the distribution of N(r) is determined by that of V(r). The internal rate of return is a random variable R whose distribution is defined by P{R &gt; r} - P{N(r) .&gt; 0}, (10) for reasons explained by Hillier (1963). 3. DISTRIBUTION OF REINVESTED PROFITS Suppose that the initial capital k and all profits are expressed as integral multiples of the same monetary unit. Let Ni be the capital at time t when all profits are reinvested, and let Gk(s, t) be the p.g.f. of Nt when No = k. Clearly Gk(s, t) = GI(s,t), (11) so we take No = 1. Each unit of capital is now supposed to generate profits at the epochs of occurrence of a Poisson process with rate ox, and the number of units into which each unit is transformed when a profit arises has the p.g.f. sb(s). Then the sequence No, N1, N2, ... is a time-homogeneous Markov branching process, and Gl(s, t) is given implicitly by the equation fGi dx y 12 Js x+(x)-x (12) which is derived by Bartlett (1955, Section 3.4) and Harris (1963, Ch. V, Section 9). The solution when +(s) = s is well known. For a more realistic example, suppose that profits have a geometric distribution with p.g.f. +(s) = s/(2 - s). Then G1/(l -G1)1 = {s/(l -s)} exp (-ot). Only one of the possible solutions is admissible and we obtain G1(s, t) = 1 - [(. _ L exp (-2ot) +4} -(1 -s)e x-P tt)] (13) More generally, an approximate solution is obtained as follows. Define v(x) = {1- (X)}/(l-x). In the integral for Gl(s, t), take s&gt;0, substitute y = log {x/(l -x)}, and write v(x) = w(y). We obtain 0log{G1/(1-G)} dy 0g=81(1-) - t(14) log{s/(1-s)} w9(y)</page><page sequence="6">6 PLAcKETT - Stochastic Models of Capital Investment [No. 1, or, alternatively, flo{G1/(l-s)} R) flog{S/(1-8)} dy JO @(Y) J@co(y) Let *( ) be a function such that = x. (15) Its derivatives are given by Zdy )_({l(x) d) xn Hence o G (log{s/(l-s)} dy ) = [exp {-ofts(l -s) q(s) 4}] log(e)- Thus log(l- = log(l-)-at n(s) + K(at)2 X(q(x) W - '(x)}, (16) where s &lt; x &lt; G1. In cases where the third term on the right is small compared with the second, we obtain Gk(s, t) = [1 +(s' - 1) exp{cxtr)(s)}]k. (17) We now face the laborious task of disinterring the individual probabilities. An inspection of the p.g.f suggests that we further approximate by fitting a negative binomial distribution, and the results of this procedure can be compared with exact values where known. The problem of finding the distribution of discounted profits in a Markov branching process is likely to present even greater difficulties. 4. REPLACEMENT POLICY The replacement of a component item that deteriorates with time has been a topic of current interest since the work of Lotka and Campbell thirty years ago. Recent developments have been concerned with a stochastic model where successive states of the environment form a Markov chain, and with a system of rewards or pay-offs which depend on the age of the equipment and the state of the environment. There is an excellent introduction by Howard (1960) who shows that an optimum replacement policy can be determined by dynamic programming. Jorgenson, McCall and Radner (1967) give a detailed survey which includes adaptive policies derived by Bayesian methods. A general criticism of this work is that the objective function by which the optimum is determined consists either of the expected cost per unit time or of the expectation of discounted future costs. Any other information about the distribution of costs is ignored. An interesting example is described by Drinkwater and Hastings (1967) and Hastings (1969) in connection with the replacement of military vehicles, and the essential features are as follows. After the initial cost K, there is a sequence of</page><page sequence="7">1969] PLACKETT - Stochastic Models of Capital Investment 7 maintenance costs at epochs generated by a time-dependent Poisson process with rate a(t). A vehicle of age x needingrepair is in fact repaired provided that the cost does not exceed p(x), the repair limit. If the cost exceeds p(x), which it does with probability E(x), then no repair is made and the vehicle is scrapped. The mean cost incurred, including zero with probability E(x), is denoted by ,u(x). Thus the expenditure rate at age x is oa(x) ,u(x), and the lives of vehicles terminate according to a Poisson process with rate o(x) E(x). Write &gt;(x) = exp (- aJ(u) E(u) du}. (18) Then the mean cost of operating a vehicle for unit time is X= {K+ fo (x) l(x)JF(x) dx}/ F(x) dx. (19) In the case of discounted costs, let h(t) be the renewal density and m(w) the Laplace transform of the lifetime distribution. At the epoch t, the distribution of vehicle age A consists of a density h(t- x),(x) for 0&lt; x &lt; t, together with a finite probability F(t) at A = t. Hence the mean discounted future cost per vehicle is 8 = K/{l -m(r)} + |f({(t) p(t)4(t) + fcx(x) pk(x) h(t- x) F(x) dx} ert dt. (20) When the repair rate and cost density are known step functions, constant over yearly intervals, the system is a Markovian decision process of the type described. Consider an asset which, after the original capital outlay, generates a sequence of profits according to a compound Poisson process. In circumstances where the rate of generation and the mean profit both decrease as a result of obsolescence or greater competition, an appropriate replacement policy can be obtained as the image of that used for vehicles and consists in replacing whenever a realized profit falls below a specified level. The levels are chosen so as to maximize a measure of profitability, the relevant expressions being similar to those already derived. However, the essential difference between the replacement problem for equipment and the replacement problem for assets is that the profits from an asset can be reinvested, and when they are substantial this will considerably affect the optimum policy. 5. APPLICATION TO PREMIUM SAVINGS BONDS Adelson (1965) describes the decision theory approach to capital investment. He begins with a penetrating review of the standard methods of appraisal by present value and internal rate of return, and then invites the reader to try his hand on two exercises. We proceed to give a solution of the first exercise, which is: Calculate the internal rate of return of a "Premium Bond" and discuss the relative merits of these and National Savings Certificates as Christmas presents. Premium Savings Bonds were introduced in November 1956 and continue to prove popular. Early in 1967 the number of bonds in issue was around ?550 million, so that the net inflow has averaged about ?1 million per week, and it continues to run at this level. In the field of speculation, bonds are unique: the original capital is preserved intact and the probability distributions corresponding to any investment policy can be evaluated. On the other hand, inflation steadily erodes the purchasing power of the capital and any prizes.</page><page sequence="8">8 PLACKETT - Stochastic Models of Capital Investment [No. 1, We consider only the situation where an initial purchase of bonds is made and held for a specified period. Within this framework, any prize money received can either be regarded as available for other purposes, or it can be used at once to increase the number of bonds held. Quantities of interest are therefore the amount of prize money received, the internal rate of return for the scheme, and the ultimate number of bonds under reinvestment. Some of the relevant distributions have been calculated, and they enable a comparison to be made with investment in a Building Society or National Savings Certificates, where the original capital is again preserved "intact" but now combined with a fixed rate of interest or growth of capital. We begin by describing the method in which the scheme is operated. The main sources for the following details are the Prospectus available in Post Offices, and the leaflet on ERNIE obtainable from the Premium Savings Bond Office at Lytham St Annes. Bonds are issued in multiples of a ?1 unit, and each bond is eligible for inclusion in the first draw held after the expiration of three months beginning on the first day of the month following the month in which it was purchased. Since April 1967, the maximum holdings of bonds has been ?1,250; it was ?1,000 for the three previous years. In each of the monthly prize draws, the odds against a unit bond winning a prize are maintained at a relatively stable level around 9,600 to 1. We shall take the corresponding probability to be 1/9,600 exactly. The prize fund is equivalent to interest at 41 per cent per annum on the eligible bonds and is therefore now about ?2 million per month. Each complete ?100,000 of the fund is divided into 2,751 prizes of differing values, all multiples of ?25. The distribution, shown in Table 1, is extremely skew, with 971 per cent concentrated on TABLE 1 Distribution of prizes from winning bond Probability Prize money x 2,751 in ?25 units 2,480 1 200 2 30 4 20 10 10 20 10 40 1 200 prizes of ?25 and ?50, while the 21 per cent tail stretches all the way to ?5,000. In the remainder of the prize fund, each complete ?10,000 yields 295 prizes, and amounts of less than ?10,000 are divided into prizes of ?25. Since February 1966 there has been a top prize of ?25,000 every three months. However, these details have been ignored in the following calculations, because they complicate the arithmetic without seriously affecting the main conclusions, and we suppose that the prize fund is an exact multiple of ?100,000 distributed as shown. The unit of prize money is taken as ?25. Given that a prize is won, the p.g.f. of prize money is +(s) = (2,480s+200s2+ 30s4+ ... +s200)/2,751.</page><page sequence="9">1969] PLACKETT - Stochastic Models of Capital Investment 9 The p.g.f. of prize money from one ?1 bond during t months by u ?1 bonds is B(s) = {(1 -1/9,600) + f(s)/9,600yu. (21) Write tu = 12c, so that c is the product of the number of unit bonds and the number of years for which they are held. This basic parameter is described as the stake and expressed in bond-years. Further write A = c/800, and a close approximation to B(s) is given by P(s) = exp [A{q(s) - 1}]. (22) The mean of the distribution is 5tu/33,012, which corresponds to an interest rate of 4-5438 per cent per annum. Table 2 gives the probability distribution of prize money arising from a stake of c bond-years for various values of c up to 10,000, which corresponds to the virtual TABLE 2(a) Probability distributions of prize money (?) and yield (?) c = (Number of ?1 units) x (number of years held) Prize c =50 c = 100 c = 500 c=1,000 money Yield Prob.

Although the standardized distribution must tend to normality as c-? oo, yet it is so exceedingly skew for c = 1 that even when c = 10,000 there is still a marked departure from symmetry. A distribution of gamma type would be a better fit, for the reasons given when discussing limiting forms of the compound Poisson distribution. If we regard Premium Savings Bonds as a medium of investment rather than a national lottery, it is relevant to inquire into the distri- bution of yield, defined as 100(prize money)/c and expressed as a percentage. The resulting distributions are also shown in Table 2, and for selected values of c in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. An unexpected feature is the bimodal character of some distributions, most noticeable in Fig. 2. Thus, when c = 5,000, a yield of 13 per cent is more probable than one of 11 per cent. In fig. 4, several of the distributions are compared and the- slow tendency to normality can be seen. For comparative purposes, the ordinates here are inversely proportional to the interval between possible yields. All the distributions of yield have a mean of 4 5438 per cent, but their variances are inversely proportional to c. Hence, the probabilities for individual high yields and low yields both decrease as the stake is increased, although the probabilities in the tails of the distribution are somewhat unpredictable because the set of possible yields</page><page sequence="10">10 PLACKETT - Stochastic Models of Capital Investment [No. 1, TABLE 2(b) Probability distributions of prize money (?) and yield ( %) c = (Number of ?1 units) x (number of years held) Prize c 2,500 c = 5,000 c = 10,000 money Yield Prob.

The effects can be studied in Table 3, which gives the probabilities in the upper tail of the yield distribution for various values of c. Consider, for example, an individual with ?1,250 or less to invest who pays income tax at the standard rate and is not liable for surtax. The current return from a Building Society is typically 4-25 per cent income tax paid, and, in Table 4, we give the probabilities for a yield less than 4-25 per cent from Premium Savings Bonds, in which the prizes are free of income tax and surtax. TABLE 4 Bond years 100 500 1,000 2,500 5,000 10,000 P{yield&lt;4-25%} 0.88 0 54 0.61 0 70 0-67 0.64 Thus the Building Society is preferable, despite the rather higher average rate for Premium Savings Bonds. Another method of comparison would be through the expected utility of a purchase of bonds, but all these methods fade into insignificance beside the lure of substantial prizes. We consider now the effect of discounting the value of future prizes. The compound Poisson distribution of prize money corresponds to a model where amounts with p.g.f. +(s) are received at times generated by a Poisson process with rate A. Such times are uniformly distributed over (0, t). Let r be a discount rate per month and assume that e-rt&gt; . This condition ensures that the density function of present value U takes the simple form g(y) (f/try (1= 1, 2, .. .; je-rl &lt;y &lt;j), (23) 0 otherwise. The reason is that the non-zero values of {fj} are located at points j, &lt;j2 &lt; ... where -'ji+,,j* for all i. For the density of V(r), we obtain h(x) = 0 (O &lt; x &lt; e-r), (24) xh(x) = L + M (x &gt; e-t), (25) where L = Apofiltr (je-rl &lt; x&lt;j) (26) Ootherwise, M = (A/tr) [ fn{H(x - ie-r) - H(x - i)} +fj{H(x jert) -H(e-rt)}] for (j+ 1)e-rt&lt;x&lt;j+e-rt M = (A/tr) , f*{H(x - ie-rl) - H(x- i)} i=1 for j+e-r&lt;x&lt;(j+2)e-r. (27) Thus the density at x can be calculated when the distribution function is known up to x-e-rt. Some distributions of present value have been obtained using the exact formulae and the computer program already mentioned.

Table 5 gives the probability that the net present value exceeds zero as a function of the number of bonds, time held and discount rate. The last factor is the most important, and there is little variation in the probability when both the discount rate and the number of bond-years are fixed. Finally, we turn to the question of reinvesting prize money. According to the definition of an eligible bond, any prize money resulting from the initial purchase of bonds, and used to purchase more bonds immediately on receipt, cannot at present generate further prizes until four months have elapsed. It is reasonable to envisage a scheme whereby prize money is instantaneously converted into bonds which participate in the next draw, because if the bondholder waives his right to claim the prize money at once, the Government could make the necessary concession in regard to eligibility. Some difficulty will occur with large prizes which carry the holding past the maximum, but if the scheme were restricted to holdings initially less than ?500, say, then this possibility would arise only in rare cases for which simple rules could be devised.</page><page sequence="19">1969] PLACKETT - Stochastic Models of Capital Investment 19 By analogy with comparable methods operated by unit trusts, the scheme can be described in terms of accumulation bonds. Slight modifications will suffice for the reinvestment situation as it is at present, but no numerical results are available yet for either situation.

How- ever, the position is quite different for an individual with a large income and prepared to invest ?1250 indefinitely. It would then be necessary to compare the returns from other investment media after heavy taxation with that obtainable from Premium Savings Bonds. Without making a detailed study, it seems likely that such a person could justifiably hold the full amount of bonds. We thus reach the conclusion that Premium Savings Bonds have more to offer the wealthy man than the one with limited resources.

KINGMAN (University of Sussex): Mr Chairman, on this historic occasion of the first meeting organized by the Research Section to be recognized as an Ordinary Meeting of the Society, I must congratulate Professor Plackett on the dignified impartiality with which he has played his triple role of Vice-President of the Society, Chairman of the Research Section, and speaker. It is particularly fitting that the paper which he has read to us demands discussion both as a contribution to the theoretical study of certain models, and in terms of the relevance of these models to practical phenomena. I look forward to a lively debate on the latter issue, but I shall confine my remarks to the former. The central feature of the theoretical part of the paper is the plausible suggestion that the value of the profits accruing in any period of time (discounted or not) might be assumed to have a compound Poisson distribution. Such a distribution has Laplace transform given by equation (4), which may be written in the form b(w) = exp (ew--1)g(x)dx. Here g(x) = Af(x) is an "expectation density", in the sense that g(x) dx is the expected number of gains lying between x and x + dx, and A = f g(x) dx. J'o Now the limiting distribution given in equation (7) is of this same form, with g(x) = tx-1 exp (- x/S), and only fails to be of compound Poisson form because the integral for A diverges, g being infinite at x = 0. In other words, it represents a situation in which there are infinitely many gains in the interval, but most of these are very small. Only finitely many gains exceed any fixed positive level. It may well be that this model is a very relevant approximation for some practical contexts, as Professor Moran has found it in the theory of dams. But there is nothing canonical about the particular choice of the density g, except its mathematical simplicity. Had the author chosen a different form of distribution in (6), a different limit would have emerged in (7). In this sense, the result is not a limit theorem like the central limit theorem,</page><page sequence="21">1969] Discussion on Professor Plackett's Paper 21 which gives the same asymptotic form for a very large class of initial distributions. The decision to use a gamma distribution must therefore rest on empirical justification. It is with great pleasure that I propose a vote of thanks to Professor Plackett for his most interesting paper. Mr N. A. J. HASTINGS (University of Birmingham): I would like to try to relate Professor Plackett's paper to the problem of investment decision making. Investment decision making is a stochastic sequential decision process and as such it lends itself to analysis by dynamic programming, see Jacobs (1967). The recurrence relations of dynamic programming have been developed to cover the cases of undiscounted and discounted gains, discrete and continuous time, constant and variable transition rates, finite and infinite planning horizons, single and multiple Markov chains and those with absorbing states. A wide range of practical situations can be covered, at least in principle. The general recurrence relation for the case of a single ergodic Markov chain, an infinite planning horizon, continuous time and undiscounted gain is (Jewell, 1963), Vi = max {-gEO+qZ+ jpf Vj , where Vi is the value of a state i, z is a set of possible policies, g is the steady-state-gain rate, Ei is the expected duration of stay in state i, qi is the gain associated with state i, and Pij is the probability of transition from state i to state j. There is a recurrence relation of this type for each state. In the case of the repair limit replacement problem the solution of these simultaneous equations for a given set of repair limits gives the expression for the steady-state average cost rate quoted by Professor Plackett in (19). In terms of this dynamic programming formulation, Professor Plackett's paper indicates a general approach to the derivation of expressions for Ei, qi and pi. The importance of this can be seen from the history of the repair limit replacement problem. Gardent and Nonat (1963) derived (19) but only solved numerically some simple cases. Drinkwater and Hastings (1967), in a discrete time formulation, derived algebraic expressions for qi and pii by what now seems a clumsy method. The optimum repair limits were found by a hill climb technique requiring 5 minutes of computer time (KDF9) for a problem with 15 states. The same problem has now been formulated in a more general way using the approach described by the author in the derivation of Ei, qi and pij and a dynamic programming formulation. The computation time is now about 3 seconds. I feel confident that these methods can be applied with equal success to a wide range of investment problems. I have great pleasure in seconding the vote of thanks to Professor Plackett. The vote of thanks was put to the meeting and carried unanimously. Mr F. DOWNTON (University of Birmingham): First let me say how grateful I am to Professor Plackett for explaining why I have received no prizes for my small number of Premium Bonds. Fortunately the message of his paper is quite clear. I should sell them and invest the money in the activity described in Section 3 of his paper. Whatever this activity is, it yields at random epochs a geometrically distributed profit with mean 3 units for each invested unit and the minimum profit is 2 units. Unhappily the only activities I can think of which might have these properties would attract the attentions of the Vice Squad. On the more theoretical side there are basically two models for capital investment, the time-dependent Poisson process, which is used here, and renewal theory. The main difference between these models is that if an epoch of profit generation occurs at time t, the distribution of time to the next such epoch will, in general in the Poisson process, depend upon t, whereas in the renewal model it will not. These two models coincide only in the two special cases of random and regular epochs of profit generation. Others are</page><page sequence="22">22 Discussion on Professor Plackett's Paper [No. 1, more qualified than I to say which is the more appropriate model, but Professor Plackett slurs over this distinction by his reference to Dall'Aglio's (1964) paper. It is, I think, worth looking briefly at Dall'Aglio's model and its relation to the results of the present paper. Apart from the renewal assumption that the intervals between successive profit epochs are independent realizations of identically distributed random variables (with distribution function F(x)), Dall'Aglio is concerned with the discounted value V*(r), with discount rate r, of all future profits in the interval (0, oo) and with the special case, where the Laplace transform of the distribution of profits is m(w) = e-w. In contrast, the present paper is concerned with profit epochs which occur in a Poisson stream with time-dependent rate a(t), with general profit distribution whose Laplace transform is m(w), and with the discounted value V(r) of profits occurring in a finite interval (0, 4). For Dall'Aglio's model, if c*(w) - E{ewv*(r%}, this transform satisfies the integral equation c*(w) exp (- we-rl) c*(we-tr) dF(t). (1) The present paper gives in its equation (8) the expression c(w) = E{e-wFX)} = exp Jf{m(we7t) 1} oc(t) dt]. (2) As might be expected it may be verified with a little manipulation that, when m(w) = e-w and r = so, (2) satisfies (1) when (i) o(t) = a, a constant and F(t) = 1 - e, or (ii) fa(s) ds is a step-function with unit steps at t = o, 2a, 3oc, ... and F(t) is a step- function with unit step at t = ac. Thus the present paper provides a solution, in the sense of an explicit Laplace transform, to Dall'Aglio's problem of which that author was apparently not aware. Whichever of these two models may be regarded as more appropriate physically, the Poisson process approach of the present paper seems mathematically more convenient. Standard methods, for example steepest descent, might be used on (2) to obtain approxi- mations for the distribution of V(r). At a lower mathematical level, a weighted sum of gamma distributions might well approximate reasonably to this distribution. In the case when a(t) = cc and m(w) = u/kl( + w) (2) becomes c(w) = {(tk + we-r)/(,t + W)}./r, (3) which, if x/r is roughly an integer, represents such a weighted sum. More generally a weighted sum with Laplace transform ((A + weB3)/(A + w)}C, (4) where A, B and C are chosen to give the correct probability of zero profit and the first two moments might prove adequate. The true moments may readily be derived from (2). For example, if X is the amount of profit at each epoch of generation, E{ V(r)} = E(X) fert o(t) dt, (5a) var { V(r)} = E(X2) f e2rt o(t) dt, (5b) and so on. It would be interesting to compare the results obtained in this way with those obtained through the integral equation (5) of the paper.</page><page sequence="23">1969] Discussion on Professor Plackett's Paper 23 Finally, I wonder whether the assumption that successive profits are independent is a reasonable one. A model in which successive profits are connected in a Markovian way could be realistic, and as a bonus produce some interesting mathematical problems, presumably in the area of semi-Markov processes. Mr C. D. KEMP (Queen's University, Belfast): I greatly enjoyed Professor Plackett's paper and I would like to raise two points-one a minor detail on the Premium Bond data, the other a rather general point about terminology. Professor Plackett drew our attention to bimodality in some of his distributions. I would like to indicate a possible reason for this by considering the special case of the Hermite distribution which has, in his notation, fi = 0 for i&gt; 2. By thinking of this distribution as a convolution of two Poisson distributions (one of single events and one of pairs of events), it is easy to see that one may get multi-modality if f2 is relatively large -the even probabilities will tend to peak. I would therefore tentatively suggest that the bimodality in Professor Plackett's distributions may be a result of the sequence 20, 10, 10 in the left-hand column of Table 1. Turning to the general question of terminology, I hope that Professor Plackett will excuse my picking on his paper to raise this issue. Throughout, he refers to compound Poisson distributions. I would like to suggest to him that what he really means is generalized Poisson distributions, and that this distinction is not trivial. For the past 20 years or so there has been great confusion in the literature over the use of "compound" and "generalized". Perhaps the paper which best defines the distinction is by Gurland (1957). Applying his definitions to the Poisson case, a compound Poisson distribution results when we regard the Poisson parameter as being itself distributed, and the resultant (discrete) distribution has probability generating function (p.g.f.) of the form Gc(s) = fexp {cx(s - 1)} dF(x), where c is essentially a scaling constant. A generalized Poisson distribution arises as the distribution of S. = In Xi, where the Xi are independently distributed with p.g.f. +(s), whilst n has a Poisson distribution with parameter A. Sn then has p.g.f. exp [A{+b(s) - 1}]. The Xi (and hence SJ) do not necessarily have to be discrete, but consideration is usually restricted to the discrete case. Gurland considered how some distributions can be both compound and generalized, and presumably this situation has led to much of the confusion. It is well known, for example, that the negative binomial is both Poisson compounded by gamma and Poisson generalized by logarithmic. Again, the Hermite is both Poisson compounded by normal and Poisson generalized by binomial (index 2). However, the two processes are quite different, both mathematically and physically, and ought to be distinguished. Various alternative names have been proposed-a modern pair are "mixed Poisson" and "Poisson mixture", but these seem liable to confusion. Of all the names used for what has been defined above as a generalized Poisson (and these include Poisson power series distribution, multiple Poisson distribution, composed Poisson distribution) my favourite was suggested by Galliher (1959) for the case when the X, are geometric variables, and is "stuttering Poisson" distribution. However, whether or not one adopts this particular name, I do feel that it is important that we make a distinction between the two types of distribution and try to avoid further confusion in the literature. Dr J. A. BATHER (University of Sussex): In his paper, Professor Plackett rightly stresses the stochastic nature of investment models, but it seems to me that the possibility of choice is also an essential ingredient. Of course, particular investment opportunites, such as savings bonds, can be evaluated for investment policies fixed in advance and his contribution is valuable in this respect. But any comparison of opportunities, based on such evaluations, neglects the possibility of making decisions sequentially. For example,</page><page sequence="24">24 Discussion on Professor Plackett's Paper [No. 1, in building any model of the opportunities offered by the stock market, it is clearly important to allow for sequential investment policies. However, in order to make progress in this direction, I think we must be prepared, at first, to consider very simple repre- sentations of random behaviour. The difficulty with the Markov chain models mentioned in Section 4 is that although, in principle, optimal policies can be computed, in practice realistic models often lead to indigestion on the part of the computer. In any case, we need reasonably explicit mathe- matical solutions in order to gain some insight about the characteristics of good policies. Again, compound Poisson models are difficult to handle explicitly, even when there is no control variable present. This is partly because the laws of motion for systems based on Poisson processes are differential difference equations. Roughly speaking, the only stochastic systems for which the laws of motion are differential equations are those based on diffusion processes: the mathematical convenience of normal distributions can be allowed to stretch the implications of the central limit theorem, in sequential control theory no less than in statistical analysis. For example, at first sight, a diffusion process is a very crude representation of the input to a dam or the output from an inventory. But, in each case, the use of a diffusion model leads to control procedures which are both explicit and intuitively acceptable (Bather, 1966, 1968). Dayananda (1968) has used a similar model for the behaviour of the reserves of an insurance company, in order to obtain optimal reinsurance procedures. Finally, it is worth mentioning the current investigation of a diffusion model for stock market prices by A. Albert. So far his results have not been announced, but neither has his bankruptcy. Mr H. R. FISHER (Ministry of Power): I started on Professor Plackett's paper hoping it would help in dealing with uncertainties surrounding investment in public enterprises. But I finished, as indeed he seems to have done also, in getting engrossed in Premium Bonds. Perhaps we should be grateful to the Government for the fact that there exists at least one respectable form of investment that is exactly subject to the theory of probability, with perfect rigour and perfect information. Looking at the distributions in Tables 2(a) and 2(b), or Figs. 1-4, one may be struck by their not appearing to have the required mean yield of 4-5438 per cent. So far as tabulated 1(yield x probability) amounts to about 3-3 to 3-7 in the various columns, leaving there- fore a considerable fraction of the mean yield to be contributed by the tail of the distribution. The importance of the tail may be seen from an artifice that virtually abolishes it. Suppose the prizes set out in Table 1 are classified into "low" prizes and "high" prizes. For illustration, say that the prizes of 20, 40 and 200 units-that is, ?500 to ?5,000-are the high ones. Convert the high prizes into booby prizes, or snakes as opposed to ladders, the quality of which is that they are not only themselves zero but also cancel any low prizes that the drawer might otherwise get from his predeclared stake of c bond-years. The mere replacement of the high prizes by zero prizes would reduce the expected value of any one prize from 4,000/2751 (easily worked out from Table 1) to 3,200/2751, so bringing the expectation of yield down in proportion from 4 5438 per cent to 3 6350 per cent. The further effect of the former high prizes cancelling low ones is to multiply this reduced expectation by a factor which is very closely exp {( - c/800) x (21/2751)} that is exp (- c/104,800), as one may see by evaluating B'(1) with the omission from 0 of its last three terms. With c = 2,500, as in Table 2(b), the exponential factor is 0-97643, and so in this case the yield is brought to 3 54935 per cent. Such a snakes-and-ladders variant of the game, even if administratively practicable, would plainly be very much less attractive than the normal version with or without rational assessment. It is mentioned merely because (though increasing the probability of zero yield) it would give rise to probabilities of yields 1, 2, 3, ... 18 per cent precisely the same as those tabulated, these yields (and 19 per cent) being achievable only through low prizes. The difference is that in the snakes-and-ladders version the tail does tail off</page><page sequence="25">1969] Discussion on Professor Plackett's Paper 25 beyond 18 per cent as it appears to be doing, the first moment being 3 537 calculated from the tabulated values up to yield 18 per cent, which is nearly all of the whole 3 54935 just noted. The remaining 22 per cent of the higher expectation provided by the actual scheme comes from the contribution of the high prizes to a tail that is not negligible. It is not merely a very long tail; with four places of decimals it surfaces again more than once. For the probability of getting one 20-unit prize or just two 10-unit prizes is about 0-0115 if c = 2,500. Given such prizes one would expect the rest of the 12 x 2,500 monthly draws still to throw up smaller prizes with almost the same probabilities as in the absence of wins of 10 or 20. So corresponding to the mode at yield of 3 per cent (or 3 prize units) one would expect a mode at yield (20 + 3) per cent, as part of a group of probabilities, from yield 20 on, nearly the same as 0-0115 times the probabilities of yields 0 to 9 per cent. This in fact is found, with the modal probability of 0-0022 at yield 23 per cent. A mode nearly as large, associated with a prize of 40 units, must come at yield 43 per cent. The multimodal character of these distributions is evidently a general one, the modes appearing as "shadows" of the widely spread large prizes, being often large enough to throw up a significant figure when, to four decimal places, the probabilities have apparently run down to zero. Such shadows may be traced in the diagrams. In Fig. 3, for example, there is a suspicion of a mode at 81 per cent, that is for a prize-aggregate of 33 units; 33 is 20 plus 13, the latter number of units corresponding to a yield of 3j per cent, where the main mode appears. The importance of the tail is but one aspect of the fact, brought out elsewhere in the paper, that the full expectation depends on a fair chance of a moderate return and a remote chance of high wins. In Table 5, for example, the D.C.F. yield that there is a 50 per cent chance of reaching is between 3* and 32 per cent in all cases, while the probability of getting at least the expected 4-5438 per cent seems to be only about 0-27 or 0-28 with even 10,000 bond-years. Can it readily be said whether there is any difference in the behaviour of the probabilities in Table 5 when one or other of the number of units and the number of years held tends separately to infinity? That is, would there persist the apparent unimportance of the way the bond-year product is made up? Mr A. J. MAYNE (Creative Enterprises Ltd.): I, too, wish to express my thanks to Professor Plackett, because he has begun to open up what should become an extremely interesting field of research, both theoretical and practical. I would like to mention several aspects of both those headings. I think that a lot of work needs to be done on the sorts of stochastic model for this type of situation which are appropriate in a variety of practical problems. Professor Plackett has mentioned one or two of these possibilities, and I would like to mention a few others. One type of model might, for example, have the hypothesis that, in each of a sequence of discrete time periods, there is a return which is a random variable, and the return in a given period might have a distribution which depends only on the return from the previous period. That is to say, the probability distribution of return from period N, say, would be some function of X and Y, where Y is the return in period N- 1 and X is the return in period N. As a special case, when the returns are independent, this function would not include Y. Another case which would be interesting would be where the ratio XI Y has a given probability distribution; I think that this is one type of model on which some useful work might be done. Another type of model would arise in considering quantities such as returns from research and development efforts, where there is perhaps a situation intermediate between the sort of model, appropriate to return from ordinary industrial investments, and the Premium Bond model of Section 5 of the paper. In the case of research and development programmes, there are perhaps two major possibilities.</page><page sequence="26">26 Discussion on Professor Plackett's Paper [No. 1, Firstly, a situation where the time to fruition of a research project is a random variable and where the outcome from the research project would be zero with a finite probability but would have a continuous probability distribution for a positive return (in some cases that probability distribution might be a multi-modal distribution). Secondly, the whole distribution might be continuous and thus more convenient to handle. Turning to the theoretical side, I would like to say something about how to perform the calculations. This problem, I think, will be an extremely interesting testing ground for a variety of theoretical as well as practical methods of approximation in problems of distributions. For example, the Cornish-Fisher formulae and their generalizations will turn out to be useful in certain examples of these models but not in all cases. Again, it will be useful to work out some of these cases by means of the "saddle-point" approxi- mation. I would like to mention in passing that it is quite easy to calculate explicitly the cumulants of a distribution of a random variable which itself is the sum of a random number of random variables. This method has been used already in a number of different practical problems. Finally, turning to the case when theoretical methods do not succeed in yielding workable approximations, there is always the time-honoured resort of Monte Carlo or simulation methods, which would be very valuable when the realistic models are too complicated to be handled by theoretical methods alone. It would probably be better to use, not straightforward simulation, but some sort of weighted simulation where the occurrence of rare events in the model is made relatively more frequent. The following contribution was made in writing, after the meeting. Professor G. P. PATIL (Pennsylvania State University): As a person not involved with any major investment problems, I naturally looked first at the last line of the present paper, which reads: "We thus reach the conclusion that Premium Savings bonds have more to offer the wealthy man than the one with limited resources." Thus, with my curiosity aroused, I found the paper all the more inviting, instructive and rewarding. Professor Plackett deserves credit and sincere congratulations for fruitfully investing his time and skills in providing these intellectually stimulating stochastic models of capital investment. As for the comments on the technical contents, I have three remarks to offer. The first one is of appreciation for the elegant, elementary and effective recurrence formula (3) for discrete probabilities and its continuous analogue as given in (5). Some authors have attempted to obtain recursion formulae for specific compound and generalized distributions. Katti (1966) has mentioned a general one in terms of factorial moments. Professor Plackett's formula should be a blessing to the research workers needing to use models involving random sums. My second remark concerns the paragraph following (7) where Professor Plackett states in the first sentence: "The corresponding argument for a discrete distribution of profits will not be quite so obvious because the profits take values on the positive integers, but should all approach zero when the limit is taken." First of all, we note that in the set-up of the present paper, a profit is positive if it occurs, and when measured in integral multiples of some convenient unit, the smallest integral profit would be of unit magnitude, and thus, when the limit is taken, it would appear more reasonable to assume the positive integer-valued profits to approach unity and not zero. For example, fL = f(j; 0), for which lim f(j; 0) = I 0-4r if j = 1 and zero otherwise, would be a discrete model corresponding to the continuous case as discussed in the paper around equations (6) and (7). In particular, the logarithmic distribution given by f(j; 0) =cO/j, i = 1, 2, ..., oo, 1 =-ln (1 - 0), 0&lt; 0&lt;1, may be one to think of in this connection.</page><page sequence="27">1969] Discussion on Professor Plackett's Paper 27 Professor Plackett observes in the second sentence of the paragraph following (7): ". .. the appearance of a negative binomial distribution in the limit would represent an appropriate analogy to the continuous case." It is very interesting to note on this question that (see Quenouille, 1949; Feller, 1950; Patil and Joshi, 1968) with f(j;p) (xpj/j and the Poisson parameter A = - k logp, the resulting distribution for the total profit turns out to be negative binomial with parameters k and p. Thus the negative binomial would arise as an exact model on its own and not just as an approximation to the continuous gamma model. In my third remark, I should like to raise, briefly, my general concern with the multiple usage of the frequently used basic terms, like the compound and generalized distributions. Both mixtures and random sums have been termed compound distributions in statistical literature. Generalized distributions have been understood to mean random sums. Several references could be cited for either of these cases. I wonder if the terms could not be fixed to have unique meaning to avoid apparent confusion in the minds of students and applied scientists. I, for one, feel more often inclined to use the terms of mixtures and random sums, which seem to have the advantage of also being very explicit and transparent, as for example, gamma mixture of Poisson variables, Poisson sum of logarithmic variables, etc. In connection with my remark on terminology and notation, I wonder if Professor Plackett would not allow the usual practice for the Laplace transforms and the moment generating functions to carry opposite signs for their arguments. This would then necessitate sign changes in the binomials in (6), (7) and in (iii). Professor PLACKETT replied informally at the meeting and subsequently in writing as follows: I should like to thank the contributors to the discussion for their helpful remarks. Where they have made criticisms, I am usually in agreement. Professor Kingman gives an interesting interpretation of equations (4) and (7) through the concept of an expectation density. He points out that a different form of distribution in (6) would lead to a different limit in (7). However, the gamma-like distributions in Figs. 1 to 3 were obtained with large A from the non-gamma distribution in Table 1, so that assumption (i) may not be crucial. Mr Hastings and Dr Bather both comment on the absence of any account of sequential decision policies, and their informed remarks on this field are therefore valuable. Dr Bather gives convincing mathematical reasons for basing investment decision models on diffusion processes rather than Markov chains. His mention of a diffusion model for stock market prices is a reminder that diffusion processes first appeared in the remarkable study by Bachelier of transactions on the Paris bourse (see, for example, Cootner, 1964). Mr Downton has greatly clarified the relationship between Dall'Aglio's work and mine. His analysis of equation (8) is useful in suggesting other approaches to the solution which could be compared with the integral equation method. Mr Mayne also has pointed to the relevance of saddlepoint approximation. Mr Kemp and Professor Patil both distinguish clearly between the terms compound and generalized, and I regret that my interpretation of previous papers has led me to employ the first term when the second is appropriate. Methods for restoring order are evidently desirable, and on the whole I prefer explicit descriptions to anthropomorphic terminology. Professor Patil gives welcome observations and references concerning the negative binomial distribution. He is right to criticize my ambiguous notation for Laplace transforms. The multimodality of the undiscounted yield distributions is well explained by Mr Kemp and Mr Fisher. This aspect can also be viewed as a consequence of equation (3), the general solution of which is a linear combination of cyclical terms. Mr Fisher's analysis of the tails of these distributions is very illuminating. His comment on the apparent unimportance of the way in which the bond-year product is made up in Table 5 points to</page><page sequence="28">28 Discussion on Professor Plackett's Paper [No. 1, the need for a further study of discounted yield distributions. This would assess the separate contributions of bonds and years, thus answering the questions which he raises. Mr Mayne indicates how the models given in the paper can be extended in various directions and he suggests ways in which the consequent distributions can be handled. He is one of several speakers who refer to the practical applications of these results. The principal difficulty would appear to lie in bridging the communication gap between the class of workers in applied probability and the class of financial managers in business. Until this problem is satisfactorily resolved, the purpose of more extensive model-building is open to question. REFERENCES IN THE DISCUSSION BATHER, J. A. (1966). A continuous time inventory model.
