FARR') (Institut fur Biologie, Gesellschaft fur Strahlen- und Umweltforschung, Neuherberg bei Miunchen, B.R.D.) (With 3 Figures) (Acc. 18-1-1980) INTRODUCTION Why do animals do what they do? This is the ultimate question to be answered by an ethologist, and current theoretical considerations of kin selection (HAMILTON, 1964a, 1964b), frequency-dependent sexual selec- tion (GADGIL, 1972; O'DONALD, 1977a, 1977b, 1978a), selfish genes and replicator selection (DAWKINS, 1976, 1978), and, probably most impor- tantly, evolutionarily stable strategies (MAYNARD SMITH &amp; PRICE, 1973; MAYNARD SMITH, 1974; MAYNARD SMITH &amp; PARKER, 1976) have in- dicated in particular that the selective forces molding social behavior pat- terns are more complex than anticipated by previous models of natural selection. It is becoming increasingly obvious that costs and benefits of alternative behavior patterns must be considered in order to understand how existing systems are maintained. The evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) models of MAYNARD SMITH &amp; PRICE (1973) and MAYNARD SMITH (1974) have even predicted that certain existing social behavior patterns 1) I am especially grateful to Prof. J.

Finally, it is important to point out that the net gain derived from exhibiting a particular behavior pat- tern is not constant, but rather depends on what other animals in the population are doing (GADGIL, 1972; MAYNARD SMITH &amp; PRICE, 1973; MAYNARD SMITH, 1974). .In this paper I investigate the effects of five forces on the reproductive success of male guppies, Poecilia reticulata, a live-bearing teleost in the family Poeciliidae. These forces are various quantitative aspects of social behavior and male sexual coloration, and I will attempt to answer three basic questions concerning them. First, how does each force alone in- fluence reproductive success of males? Second, how do the various forces interact to affect mating success? Third, how is reproductive success changed if competitors exhibit a different combination of forces? Before specific hypotheses regarding determination of mating success can be presented, a description of natural guppy populations is necessary to ac- quaint the reader with their general biology. As in all poeciliids, fertilization in guppies is internal. Sperm is trans- ferred by the male to the female through a modified anal fin, the gono- podium. Females can store sperm, and a single insemination can result in production of several successive broods (HILDEMANN &amp; WAGNER, 1954; BAERENDS, BROUWER &amp; WATERBOLK, 1955). Females exhibit an ovarian cycle of approximately 30 days, with ripe ova being present immediately after birth of a brood (TURNER, 1937). Two behavioral sequences can result in insemination. Males can either display to females and copulate with their cooperation after a stereotyped female responsive behavior, or they can attempt to inseminate females without their acceptance and cooperation (CLARK &amp; ARONSON, 1951; KADOW, 1954; BAERENDS, BROUWER &amp; WATERBOLK, 1955; LILEY, 1966). The latter behavior, termed gonopodial thrusting, merely involves orientation behind the female, erection of the gonopodium, and attempted insertion into the female's genital pore. I define a gonopodial thrust specifically as any copulation attempt either without prior display or without a prior female response. The male courtship display consist of a sigmoid arching of the body with the caudal fin either closed or fully spread, and the female receptive behavior consists of swimming in a tight circle with the genital pore ex- posed. Females are generally receptive to male displays only as virgins or during the portion of the ovarian cycle when ripe ova are present (KADOW, 1954; LILEY, 1966). Successful inseminations by either display-</page><page sequence="3">40 JAMES A. FARR acceptance or gonopodial thrusting are rare (CLARK &amp; ARONSON, 1951; LILEY, 1966; FARR &amp; HERRNKIND, 1974; FARR, 1975). In both laboratory and natural populations, males devote a great amount of time to sexual activity. Males exhibited approximately 7.0 courtship displays per five minutes in a laboratory study (FARR &amp; HERRN- KIND, 1974), and as many as 13.0 displays per male per five minutes in some natural populations (FARR, 1975). The rate of gonopodial thrusting ranged between 0.5 and 3.0 thrusts per male per five minutes in natural populations. In neither the laboratory study nor the field study were suc- cessful copulations observed, and the ratio of unsuccessful to successful displays or gonopodial thrusts is thus very high. Aggressive interactions among guppies consist of lateral displays or, more frequently, simple nips and chases (BAERENDS, BROUWER &amp; WATER- BOLK, 1955; LILEY, 1966). Such behavior is almost non-existent in natural populations (FARR, 1975), and is observed in laboratory popula- tions mostly at high population densities (WARREN, 1973; FARR &amp; HERRN- KIND, 1974). In the present study I restrict my use of the terms "aggres- sion" and "aggressiveness" to a quantitative evaluation of the number of attacks by an individual against other individuals in a population. I do not mean to include the common motivational factors underlying both agonistic interactions and courtship as discussed by BAERENDS et al. (1955). My use of the term "aggression" deals strictly with "nip right" (BRADDOCK, 1945). In addition to the sexual dimorphism in anal fin morphology, male guppies also exhibit a very conspicuous secondary sexual coloration not seen in females. Within populations there is a high degree of polymor- phism in male coloration (REGAN, 1906, 1913; HASKINs et al., 1961). Predators appear to exert selection pressure on the visibility and the mode of inheritance of different male color patterns (HASKINs et al., 1961; ENDLER, 1978), but predation has not been shown to be responsible for the high degree of polymorphism. The five forces to be investigated with regard to their effects on reproductive success are rate of courtship display, rate of gonopodial thrusting, male aggressiveness, male color pattern conspicuousness, and the frequency of male color patterns in a population. The specific ques- tions and hypotheses associated with each feature of social behavior and coloration are as follows. 1. Courtship display rate. The basic question is: Why do males court females at such a high rate</page><page sequence="4">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 41 relative to number of successful copulations? I hypothesized in earlier papers (FARR, 1975, 1976) that males with higher display rates have a greater probability of encountering receptive females. A second hypothesis is that females actually prefer the most active males. Previous experiments showed that males do not always exhibit their maximum possible display rate, but rather adjust their display activity in response to the presence of other males (FARR &amp; HERRNKIND, 1974; FARR, 1976), and this suggests perhaps that choice of more vigorous males is impor- tant. The following experiments were designed to demonstrate that high display rates are indeed positively correlated with reproductive success, and to determine whether the advantage is stochastic or based on a female preference. 2. Gonopodial thrusting. Because it bypasses female choice mechanisms, the primary interest regarding this form of insemination is whether it significantly affects mating success in addition to or counter to true copulations gained through courtship. I will attempt to determine if the mating system in guppies is wholly in agreement with female choice, or if the selfish in- terests of males can significantly alter what would be the ideal mating system from the standpoint of females.1) 3. Male aggression. GANDOLFI (1971) and GORLICK (1976) concluded that male dominance in guppies is positively correlated with reproductive success. I hypothe- size the opposite for the following reason. If it were advantageous to be aggressive, one would expect to see frequent agonistic interactions in nature. Many other poeciliids are highly aggressive (MOORE &amp; McKAY, 1971; CONSTANTZ, 1975; MCPHAIL, 1978; MARTIN, 1975; BAIRD, 1968), 1) In another paper (FARR, in press), I considered gonopodial thrusting a form of rape. My use of that term has drawn much criticism, primarily because it is regarded as too emotional or anthropomorphic. BAERENDS (pers. comm.) regards gonopodial thrusting merely as a reduced courtship sequence, and he defined rape as a "forced copulation (or attempt) of a female seriously defending herself." From the standpoint of the female gup- py, gonopodial thrusting has a negative connotation because it bypasses or ignores female choice options, and hence, I believe that it should be distinguished functionally from merely a reduced courtship sequence. PARKER (1974) defined rape as a successful mating despite rejection reactions by a female. If one considers lack of a positive response to a male as a rejection reaction, then gonopodial thrusting in guppies is, in fact, rape. I will avoid use of the term "rape" in this paper, and will leave it to the reader to decide if such behavior fits the definition of rape, or if another term is more appropriate. I would welcome any opinions or suggestions.</page><page sequence="5">42 JAMES A. FARR and it would seem that high levels of aggression would also be seen in guppies if it were an advantageous trait. Thus, I will test the hypothesis tht intermale aggression is maladaptive against the alternative that it has a positive effect on mating success. 4. Male color pattern conspicuousness. HASKINs et al. (1961) suggested that fernales prefer brighter males over those with less conspicuous color patterns. Their experiments, however, did not control for possible influences of social behavior on male mating success, so the following experiments were designed both to control for social behavior and to determine whether there are correlates between coloration and social behavior patterns. The hypothesis that pattern brightness positively influences reproductive success will be examined more carefully. 5. Color pattern frequency. Is there a frequency-dependent mechanism related to female choice of males which can account for the polymorphism in male color patterns? PETIT (1958) documented frequency-dependent sexual selection in Drosophila, and much subsequent work with Drosophila and other in- vertebrates has shown that males with rare phenotypes often are prefer- red by females (see reviews by EHRMAN &amp; PARSONS, 1976, and EHRMAN &amp; PROBBER, 1978). Frequency-dependent mate selection can create a polymorphism (ANDERSON, 1969) and can be advantageous in species in which heterozygosity is adaptive (LACY, 1979). It is possible that frequency-dependent mechanisms of mate selection are also operating in guppies and related species. FARR (1977) demon- strated that female guppies will mate with new males introduced to a population if they carry color patterns different from original males, and evidence for a rare male effect was presented. HASKINS et al. (1961) demonstrated that multiple inseminations were frequent in natural populations of guppies, and BOROWSKY &amp; KHOURI (1976) and BOROWSKY &amp; KALLMAN (1976) reported similar findings for two species of Xipho- phorus, polymorphic species related to guppies. As will be pointed out below, certain patterns of multiple mating can have a frequency-depen- dent effect and maintain polymorphisms without a definite rare male effect. Finally, BOROWSKY &amp; KALLMAN (1976) presented evidence for disassortative mating in Xiphophorus maculatus with respect to color pat- tern. The present experiments will investigate whether female choice pat-</page><page sequence="6">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 43 terns in guppies are capable of maintaining the observed polymorphism in male secondary sexual coloration. The basic principles of the experiments are as follows. The behavior of genetically-marked males in small laboratory populations was quantified, the paternity of the broods produced by females was determined by means of the genetic markers, and reproductive success was then examin- ed statistically as a function of the various quantitative behavioral and color characteristics. I used several different inbred strains of guppies for the investigation. Every strain is characterized by different male color patterns with known modes of inheritance, so by using males from dif- ferent strains in each population it was possible both to identify the dif- ferent males for observation purposes without artificial marking techni- ques and to determine paternity of the offspring by examining the colora- tion of adult males from each brood. In addition, different strains exhibit quantitatively different behavior patterns (FARR, 1976) and carry color patterns of different conspicuousness, so it was possible to employ CURIO'S (1973) method of variants for determining the functional significance of the various traits in question. By establishing artificial laboratory populations in which competing males exhibited different quantitative behavior patterns or coloration, it was possible to create greater within-population variability than one would find in nature and to reconstruct how the evolutionary process might have led to the present behavioral situation in guppies. I conducted three different series of experiments. In the first series (Section A of the Results) I observed populations with two males, each from a different strain, and two females. From these populations I deter- mined the following: 1. Interstrain variability in social behavior patterns and the possibility that quantitative aspects of sexual and aggressive behavior are inherited. 2. The extent to which males affect the quantitative social behavior patterns of competitor males. 3. The relationship between relative courtship display rate and male reproductive success. 4. The effects of gonopodial thrusting and intermale aggression on reproductive success. 5. The influence of male color pattern conspicuousness on female choice of males. 6. The frequency of multiple inseminations and the variation among females in the criteria for choosing males.</page><page sequence="7">44 JAMES A. FARR In the second series of experiments (Section B of the Results) I examin- ed primarily whether males possessing a rare color pattern have an ad- vantage in mating. For these experiments I used populations with ten males, representing two strains in different frequencies, and ten females. In control populations in which two male strains occurred in equal numbers, it was possible to examine further the influence of quantitative behavior patterns and male coloration on reproductive success. Finally, in Section C of the Results I examine polymorphic popula- tions with ten males, two from each of five strains, and ten females. This section is concerned primarily with the frequency with which females mate with more than one male and with how quantitative aspects of male sexual behavior influence the choice. Reproductive success of competing genetically-marked males was thus measured directly in terms of number of broods produced. I will demonstrate that all the above forces can affect male reproductive suc- cess. More importantly, I will show that there are no absolute factors which determine success in mating. Instead, the probability of mating (and hence fitness) is determined by how a male behaves or appears relative to other males. Finally, an evolutionary model accounting for the present social system in guppies will be presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS Males from seven different strains of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) were used in the ex- periments. All stocks were maintained in collective breeding aquaria in the laboratory of Prof. J. H. SCHRODER in the Gesellschaft fur Strahlen- und Umweltforschung, Neuherberg, West Germany. Although the strains are not inbred by continuous mating between siblings, several of the strains are quite old. It can be assumed that maintenance of the fish in small population sizes and occasional "bottle-necking" of the populations over the years during establishment of new breeding stocks have resulted in a reduction in genetic variability in the stocks and a subsequent high degree of isogenesis among the in- dividuals of a given strain. The following is as description of the strains used in this study. Maculatus (Ma) - Males exhibit a large black spot on the dorsal fin and a second black spot on the abdomen at the base of the anal fin. A large contrasting red spot on the body separates the two black spots and provides a high degree of brightness and contrast. SCHMIDT (1920) and WINGE (1922) demonstrated that the pattern is Y-linked, and HASKINS et al. (1970) showed color photographs of this strain. Pauper (Pa) - Males exhibit a long, orange and white-iridescent patch on the caudal peduncle. This is also a Y-linked pattern (WINGE, 1927), and color photographs of Pauper males can be found in HASKINs et al. (1970). Nigrocaudatus/Filigran (Ni/Fil) - Filigran is a Y-linked gene which causes a fine white, gold, and black network on the caudal fin and caudal peduncle. Nigrocaudatus is an X-linked gene which causes a total blackening of the caudal peduncle and caudal fin (also sometimes expressed in females). Nigrocaudatus obscures any other genes for coloration. Not all males in the collective breeding stocks carried the Nigrocaudatus pattern, so the Filigran pattern was expressed. DZWILLO (1959) demonstrated the mode of inheritance of both genes and provided black-white photographs of both color patterns.</page><page sequence="8">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 45 Istanbul (Ist) - This is the most elaborately patterned strain used in these experiments. Males possess an elongated pigmented caudal fin, a white dorsal fin with a large black spot in the center, a long red bar on the caudal peduncle, and an overall green-iridescent appearance on the remaining body. A Y-linked gene (Ds) causes the elongation and pigmentation of the dorsal and ventral margins of the caudal fin, and an X-linked gene (Cp) determines most of the remaining pattern. The mode of inheritance of both patterns was determined by DZWILLO (1959) (his "Facher" strain), and black-white photographs of males were included in his work. Maculatus/Gold (Ma/gg) - An absence of melanin resulting from the recessive autosomal gene g causes a gold background body color in both sexes. The Maculatus pattern in the males is expressed only as an orange spot on the gold background. The gene g was first described by GOODRICH et al. (1944). BlaulIridescens (Bl/Ir) - Iridescens is a Y-linked gene causing a bright orange coloration of the caudal fin and part of the caudal peduncle (WINGE, 1927). In pure stocks of Bl/Ir, however, this color is not expressed because of the recessive autosomal gene r which causes a deficiency of carotenoids (DZWILLO, 1959). The background coloration of both sexes is a dull gray-blue, and the secondary sexual coloration of the males is expressed on- ly as a lighter blue on the darker background. Males of this strain are the least con- spicuous of any used in this study. Cream/Armatus (Cr/Ar) - Armatus is a Y-linked gene causing an elongation and white pigmentation of the ventral margin of the caudal fin and a long red bar on the caudal peduncle (WINGE, 1927. Color photographs in HASKINS et al., 1970). The background col- oration of both sexes is a light cream color resulting from the double homozygous condi- tion bbgg (Blond and Gold). Females for the experiments were taken from the above strains and from an eighth strain, Smaragd/Irisdescens (Sm/Ir). In addition, interstrain hybrids from various crosses were used in some tests. These are henceforth designated XoXo to signify merely that they carried no X-linked genes for male coloration. Virgin females were collected by placing juveniles in 10 1 aquaria and removing maturing males as soon as the gonopodium began to develop. In all experiments involving two male strains, females of a third strain were used, and I found no males carrying the color pattern of the female's strain in the off- spring from any cross. I conclude that the technique of acquiring virgins was a successful one. The object of all of the experiments was to determine which males of two or more com- peting strains were more successful in mating and how mating success was correlated with various behavioral characteristics, degree of male coloration, and frequency of male color pattern in the parental population. Because all or a portion of the color patterns of the males used in these experiments are Y-linked, it was possible to determine paternity by examining the coloration of F1 males in all but one experiment. When Ma and Ma/gg males were used in the same experiment, it was necessary to use Cr/Ar females. Gold off- spring (gg) of either sex indicated that Ma/gg males sired the brood, and wild-type off- spring indicated Ma males were successful. All experiments were conducted in 37.5 1 aquaria filled with Munich tap water and demineralized water in equal parts. The temperature varied between 23° and 25°C. The water in all aquaria was filtered and aerated during the entire experimental period. Aquaria were illuminated with fluorescent lights on a 12:12 photoperiod. All fish were fed daily with TetraMin dried flake food supplemented occasionally with Tubifex, Artemia nauplii, Daphnia, and mosquito larvae. Females were introduced to all aquaria at least 24 h prior to the males. All males in a population were approximately equal in size, and only obviously healthy and sexually ac- tive males were used. All males were introduced to the females simultaneously. All behavioral observations were made between the second and seventh days following addi- tion of the males. After 28 days, the males were removed, and the females were isolated in</page><page sequence="9">46 JAMES A. FARR 10 1 aquaria until birth of their broods. The broods were maintained in these smaller aquaria until all individuals were mature, and the number of males sired by each of the possible fathers was determined. Because the sex ratio of some of the older strains was significantly less than unity, reproductive success was measured in terms of number of broods produced rather than number of male offspring. In cases of multiple inseminations, each male strain was assigned an equal fraction of the brood, regardless of the actual proportion of two or more male patterns in a single brood. The primary measure of reproductive success of a strain was the total number of broods sired by that strain or the proportion of all possible broods sired by that strain expressed as a percent. A second measure was to calculate the propor- tion of females inseminated by a strain. To illustrate the difference, consider the following example. If two male strains were competing for ten females, and each female produced a mixed brood containing males of both strains, then the total number of broods sired by each strain would be 10 x 1/2 = 5, or 50%o of the total, but the number of females in- seminated by each strain would be 10, or 100%. Several series of experiments were conducted. The details of the methods for each series of experiments will be presented in the appropriate sections of the results. RESULTS A. POPULATIONS WITH TWO MALES FROM DIFFERENT STRAINS AND TWO FEMALES Each of the possible 5! 2 21 combinations of two strains from the above seven strains of males was tested in populations with two males and two females. Five replicates of every combination of strains were run, for a total of ten possible broods from each. Each male strain was represented in 30 populations. Both males in each population were observed simultaneously for ten periods of five min, and the number of courtship displays, gonopodial thrusts,and aggressive interactions of each male were scored. 1. Behavioral characterization of the different strains. Table 1 summarizes the behavior and reproductive success of the seven strains of males observed in the 2-pair competition experiments. The average number of courtship displays per 50 min (10 observation periods) ranged from 24.20 for Bl/Ir males to 69.67 for Ma males. An analysis of variance indicated that strains were significantly different in courtship display behavior (F = 9.74, d.f. = 6, 203, ci&lt;0.01), thus confirming earlier findings of interstrain behavioral differences (FARR, 1976). The mean number of gonopodial thrusts ranged from 8.30 thrusts per 50 min for Ma males to 16.67 thrusts per 50 min for Pa males, but an analysis of variance indicated no significant differences among strains (F = 1.93, d.f. = 6, 203, a &gt;0.05). Strains exhibited different levels of aggressive behavior, with Ma males averaging only 0.73 aggressive attacks per 50</page><page sequence="10">TABLE 1 A summary of the behavior and reproductive success of males of seven strains ofguppies, Poecilia reticulata, in populations with two females and two different males.

A comparison of strains indicated that interstrain differences were significant (F = 2.89, d.f. = 6, 203, ci&lt;0.01). Because all strains were reared and maintained under approximately equal conditions, I conclude from these observa- tions that levels of social behavior in male guppies are at least partially in- herited and therefore subject to selection. Conclusions. 1. The seven strains exhibited significant differences in levels of court- ship activity and male aggressiveness, thus indicating high genetic variance and high heritability (EHRMAN &amp; PARSONS, 1976). 2. Within strain variation in gonopodial thrusting was high enough to obscure a potential heritable component. 2. Social facilitation of male sexual behavior. In earlier investigations I documented a social facilitation of male courtship display activity whereby single males with females display at lower rates than those with a competitor male, and males in monomor- phic populations are less active than males in dimorphic or polymorphic populations (FARR &amp; HERRNKIND, 1974; FARR, 1976). Therefore, I ex- amined in the present experiments how the behavior of the two males in each population was related. For each of the seven strains I computed the regression of Y= the level of courtship display activity of the strain in question, on X= that of the competitor males. The intercept a thus represents the average behavior of a male of a given strain if a competitor is completely inactive, b is the slope, and the quantity X is the point at which X = Y. The results are shown in Table 1, and all strains except Ni/Fil exhibited slopes significantly greater that 0. All strains had slopes less than 1, so the quantity X represents the behavioral level of a com- petitor beyond which the strain in question can no longer exhibit a higher display rate, and thus is a measure of competitive ability of the different strains. As an example, consider the strain Bl/Ir from Table 1. The regression analysis showed that if a competitor exhibits no coursthip ac- tivity, Bl/Ir males exhibit an average of 11.33 displays per 50 min (the in- tercept a). For every display exhibited by a competitor per 50 min, Bl/Ir males increase their activity by 0.28 displays per 50 min (the slope b). Bl/Ir males exhibit more courtship displays than a competitor up to 15.74 displays per 50 min (X), and exhibit a lower display rate than a com- petitor if the latter exceeds 15.74 displays per 50 min.</page><page sequence="12">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 49 That there was a correlation between the behavior of the two males in the test aquaria does not prove that there is a direct relationship between the behavior of the two males; both males could be responding to the same external factors (i. e., water conditions, different females, etc. ) rather than to each other. I conducted the following experiment to investigate the phenomenon further. Ten males of each of the strains Ma, Pa, Bl/Ir, and Ni/Fil were used as test animals. Each test male was placed in a 37.5 1 aquarium with two gravid females from a polymorphic stock population and was then observed with a succession of five different "stimulus" males from the strains Pa, Bl/Ir, Ma, Ma/gg, and Ni/Fil. Every test male was held for 24 h with only the females before addition of each stimulus male, and then each population of two males and two females was allowed a second 24 h acclimation period before the two males were observed. Both males in every population were observed simultaneously for five periods of 5 min each. The same five stimulus males were used for all ten test males of a given strain, but a different set of stimulus males was used for each test strain. After each test male had been observed with every stimulus male, the- average numbers of courtship displays and gonopodial thrusts were com- puted for each of the five stimulus males. The five stimulus males were then ranked from least to greatest with regard to average rates of court- ship display and gonopodial thrusting. I then used Page's distribution- free test for ordered alternatives based on Friedmann rank sums to test the hypothesis that the test males increased their behavior as a function of that of the competitors (HOLLANDER &amp; WOLFE, 1973). Thus, the null hypothesis was that the behavior of the test males was unchanging in the five test conditions, and the alternative was that the behavior of the test males increased as a function of the average behavior of the stimulus males. The results are shown in Table 2. All four strains showed a signifi- cant increase in their courtship display behavior as a function of increas- ing behavior of a competitor, but only Bl/Ir showed a significant increase in gonopodial thrusting correlated with that of a competitor. It can be concluded, then, that males respond to the courtship behavior of a com- petitor, and that the correlations observed in the original competition ex- periments are not attributable totally to varying external conditions. It should be noted that even though Ni/Fil males did not exhibit a significant correlation in the first competition experiments between their rate of display activity and that of a competitor, they did exhibit such a response in a test designed specifically for examination of the pheno-</page><page sequence="13">50 JAMES A.

I conclude that Ni/Fil males are less markedly affected by com- petitors than other strains, and because of this, I exclude Ni/Fil males from the following analysis of reproductive success as a function of social facilitation and competitive ability of the different strains. Conclusions. 1. There is a positive correlation between the rate of courtship display of a given male and that of a competitor. 2. Different strains exhibit different abilities to compete with other males as measured by the average rate at which males should display in the presence of a sexually inactive male, and the projected rate of court- ship display of a competitor beyond which a male can no longer exhibit a higher rate. 3. A test designed to control for possible variation in external test con- ditions showed that males do, in fact, respond to the display rate of com- petitors. 4. Only one strain showed a positive correlation between rate of gonopodial thrusting and that of a competitor. 3. Reproductive success as a function of mean strain behavior. Every strain in the first experiment was represented in 30 populations of two males and two females, and thus each strain had an opportunity to inseminate 60 females. Some females never produced offspring, and others never produced males, so the total possible number of females in- seminated was always below 60 in the analysis.

FARR tivity (rs = 0.82, a &lt;0.05), but not with mean rate of gonopodial thrusting (rs = 0.07, a &gt;0.05) or mean number of aggressive attacks made (r, = -0.36, a&gt;0.05). A comparison of reproductive success with the various parameters of the regression analysis of social facilitation of male courtship display activity showed a highlyr significant correlation with thteintercept a (r, = 1.0, ca&lt;0.01) and with k, the point beyond which a strain can no longer exhibit a higher display rate than a com- petitor (r, = 1.0, a&lt; 0.01), but there was not a significant correlation between the proportion of total broods sired and the slope of the regres- sion lines (rs = 0.73, ax&gt; 0.05). As explained above, the analysis of reproductive success as a function of the regression parameters excluded the strain Ni/Fil. Conclusions. 1. The reproductive success of seven strains in competition with every other strain in populations of two different males and two females was positively correlated with mean rate of courtship display of the strains, and with measures of the ability of strains to adjust their display activity in such a way as always to exceed that of a competitor. 2. Reproductive success was correlated neither with mean rate of gonopodial thrusting nor with male aggressiveness. 4. A further analysis of male reproductive success - general methods. The above analysis examined male reproductive success as a function of the average behavior of males of a given strain. A more detailed analysis by individual populations is required to determine more precise- ly 1) the mechanism by which high-displaying males are more successful, and 2) how gonopodial thrusting and intermale aggression might affect fitness. In the following analysis I ignore the identity of the strains and treat each of the 105 populations in terms of how the two males differed in their behavior. The behavior of the males in each population was compared as follows. First, the amount of courtship display activity and the level of gonopodial thrusting were compared by the Wilcoxon sign-rank test (HOLLANDER &amp; WOLFE, 1973) to determine if the two males differed in level of sexual ac- tivity. Aggression was usually too low to compare in this manner, so the total amount of aggression exhibited in 50 min was compared by X2 analysis. As an example, if one male exhibited 8 aggressive attacks and the other only 2 (N = 10 attacks), I determined if one male was more ag-</page><page sequence="16">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 53 gressive than the other by assuming each male should have exhibited 5 attacks if they were equally aggressive. The results of the sign-rank tests and X2 tests are not presented as such in the text. They were only a tool for me to decide if the two males in a population differed with respect to a particular behavior pattern. I merely state that there were X populations in which the two males differed with respect to behavior Y. If significant differences between two males were found, I designated the males "high" and "low" with respect to the par- ticular behavior pattern. Thus, in the following analysis "high- displaying male" is used as an abbreviation for "the more active male in a population in which a sign-rank test revealed significant differences be- tween the two males in courtship display rate." Each population was further described in terms of the proprtion of the total number of courtship displays exhibited by each male. If one male exhibited 60 courtship displays and the other only 20 (N = 80 = 100%)' then the males exhibited 75.0% and 25.0% of the total activity, respec- tively. Thus, for each population I determined 1) if the two males were different, 2) what the absolute rates of each behavior pattern were, and 3) the relative rates of courtship activity of the two males. 5. Reproductive success and relative display rate. There were 47 broods produced by females from 26 populations in which the two males differed significantly in number of courtship displays but not in the rate of gonopodial thrusting or in the level of aggression. These populations were analysed to determine the relationship between relative display rate and the probability of reproductive success, or more specifically, whether females choose the more active of two males, or if in- semination is only a function of the probability of meeting a female. I grouped the populations by the relative display rates of the two males in 5% intervals. Thus, the first group consisted of those populations in which one male made 50.1-55.0% of the total displays and the second male made 45.0-49.9% of the displays, the second group consisted of those in which one male made 55.1-60.0% of the total displays and the other 40.0-44.9%, etc. For each group, I then calculated the propor- tions of the broods produced by that group which where sired by the high- and the low-displaying males. If eight broods were produced by males in a particular group, six by the high-displaying males and two by the low-displaying males, the proportions of broods produced are 75.0% and 25.0%, respectively.</page><page sequence="17">54 JAMES A.

TOTAL COURTSHIP DISPLAYS 1. TOTAL COURTSHIP DISPLAYS Fig. 1. Reproductive success of male guppies, Poecilia reticulata, as a function of the propor- tion of total number of courtship displays made by each of two males in populations with two males and two females. Reproductive success was measured as the proportion of the total number of broods sired by high- and low-displaying males in each displays percent- age class. Within each bar is the number of broods produced by females in that percent- age class. The diagonal line is the expected proportion of broods sired by males in each class if mating success is dependent only on the probability of encountering a receptive female. Fig. la illustrates the data grouped by 5% classes for statistical analysis, and Fig. lb illustrates the same data by 10% classes for a clearer visual picture of the phenomenon. In all populations the males exhibited significant differences only in rate of courtship display. The results are shown in Fig. la. The diagonal line represents the hypothesis that reproductive success is stochastic, dependent only on relative display rate. For example, if one male courts females twice as fre- quently as another, then the first male has twice the chance of encounter- ing a female and achieving a successful copulation. Thus, if the mid- points of the bars are not significantly different from the expected value on the diagonal line, it cannot be concluded that females prefer high- displaying males. However, if the points to the right of the 50% mark fall above the line (and conversely, those to the left below it), then it can be concluded that females prefer high-displaying males, because the prob- ability of reproductive success is generally greater than would- be ex- pected given the probability of encountering a receptive female. Because the left half of the graph is determined by the right side (i. e., the two sides are not independent), only one-half of the graph can be analysed statistically. Of the nine groups represented on the right side of Fig. la, eight fall above the point of randomness. A sign test showed conclusively that</page><page sequence="18">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 55 high-displaying males are more successful than would be expected only from chance encounters with females (a &lt;0.02), so it can be concluded that high-displaying males are selected by females. Fig. lb illustrates the same data grouped by 10% classes to give a clearer visual picture of the relationship between relative display rate and the probability of reproductive success. Conclusions. 1. The probability of reproductive success of high-displaying males in populations of two males and two females is significantly greater than ex- pected if reproductive success is determined strictly by the probability of encountering a receptive female. 2. Female choice of more active males is believed to account for the differences from randomness. 6. The effects of gonopodial thrusting and aggression on male reproductive success. A similar analysis of the effects of gonopodial thrusting and male ag- gressiveness on reproductive success could not be made because males in very few populations exhibited significant differences in these behaviors without differing also with respect to another behavior pattern. Of the 105 populations observed, the males in 93 exhibited differences in rate of courtship display. In five populations, the two males exhibited no signifi- cant differences in any behavior pattern. There were only two popula- tions in which I observed differences only in the rate of gonopodial thrusting, and two of the three broods produced were sired by the males with the higher rates of gonopodial thrusting. There were three popula- tions in which the males differed only in degree of aggressiveness, and of the six broods produced, 2.5 were sired by the more aggressive males. In one population, one male exhibited higher rates of both thrusting and ag- gression, and he sired the single brood produced. Finally, in one popula- tion, one male was more aggressive while the other exhibited more gonopodial thrusting, and the higher thrusting male sired both broods produced. Because I could not analyse the effects of gonopodial thrusting and male aggression directly by holding courtship display rates equal, it was necessary to examine the differences in reproductive success between populations in which males differed only in rates of courtship display and those in which males differed both in courtship display rate and either degree of aggressiveness, rate of gonopodial thrusting, or both. The 93</page><page sequence="19">56 JAMES A. FARR populations in which differences in courtship display rate between the two males were observed were grouped according to the differences in the other two behaviors. Thus, nine groups were formed and described in terms of differences in gonopodial thrusting and/or aggression relative to the high-displaying male in each population (i.e., high-displaying male also exhibited more, equal, or less thrusting or aggression), and the pro- portion of the total number of broods produced by the high-displaying males in each group was calculated. Fig. 2 outlines the number of populations, number of broods produced by the high- and low-displaying males, and the reproductive success (% of total broods produced) of the high-displaying males in each behavioral group. I used the procedure of BARTHOLOMEW (1959) for testing ordered alternatives by X2 analysis to determine the effects of gonopodial thrusting on reproductive success. The null hypothesis was that the level of gonopodial thrusting has no effect on the number of inseminations, and the alternative was that males which both display and thrust at higher rates than a competitor should be more successful than those which only display more, but those which only exhibit higher rates of courtship display should be more successful than those which display more but exhibit significantly less gonopodial thrusting than a com- petitor. Thus, the reproductive success of high-displaying males in the center row of Fig. 2 should decrease from left to right. The results were only marginally significant (X2 = 3.85, -Q12 = 0.33, 0.05 &lt;a &lt; 0. 10), so it cannot be decided on the basis of this test alone that gonopodial thrusting has an effect on reproductive success. A second X2 test was made in which the left and center groups of the second row of Fig. 2 were combined and compared with the remaining group, and this, too, gave only marginally significant results (X2 = 3.70, d.f. = 1, a c0.06). It was impossible to use Bartholomew's procedure of ordered alter- natives for testing the hypothesis that increased aggressiveness reduces reproductive success because the raw percentages did not follow the ex- pected order. Thus, the groups in which aggression was equal and in which the high-displaying males were less aggressive were combined and compared with those populations in which the high-displaying males were also more aggressive (always with thrusting equal, thus the center column of Fig. 2). Again, the results were inconclusive. The X2 value was 3.25 (d.f. = 1), and this is significant only at the 0.10 level. There is a problem with trying to test the effects of gonopodial thrusting and aggression on reproductive success of males which already</page><page sequence="20">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 57 High - Displaying Male Exhibited Higher Rate of Gonopodial Thrusting Rates of Gonopodial Thrusting Equal High - Displaying Male Exhibited Lower Rate of Gonopodial Thrusting High - Displaying Male Less Aggressive Both Males Equally Aggressive High - Displaying Male More Aggressive 5:0 9:3 6.5 :2.5 (100.0%/) (75.0%/) (72.2/%) 3 Populations 7 Populations 5 Populations 18 5 :3.5 37.5:9.5 15.5:9.5 (84.1%/) (79.8 %) (62.0%.) 15 Populations 26 Populations 13 Populations A B C D 12:9 11:8 2:0 (57.1/.)

The upper figures in each square are the numbers of broods sired by the high- and low-displaying males, respectively, the center figure is the percentage of all broods sired by the high-displaying males in each square, and the lower figure is the number of populations observed in each category. Section A represents all populations in which the reproductive success of the high-displaying males should be either unaffected or increased by differences in aggression or rate of gonopodial thrusting, and the remaining sections represent those populations in which mating success of high- displaying males should be reduced because of differences in gonopodial thrusting (Sec- tion B), intermale aggression (Section C), or both (Section D). display at higher rates. The expected differences would be rather small, and much larger sample sizes would be required to demonstrate statistically significant effects. However, it is possible to make additional assumptions concerning the mechanisms by which thrusting or aggres- sion influence mating success, and certain groups in Fig. 2 can be com-</page><page sequence="21">58 JAMES A. FARR bined to circumvent the problems of sample size. The assumptions will be treated in detail in the Discussion. It has been shown that females prefer males with higher display rates, so it is unlikely that a high-displaying male can greatly increase his reproductive success through gonopodial thrusting. However, if a low- displaying male successfully inseminates a female through gonopodial thrusting, it is highly likely that he can provide competing sperm in addi- tion to that from a high-displaying male, thereby increasing his reproduc- tive success at the expense of the high-displaying male. I suggest, then, that the left and center columns of Fig. 2 can be combined. A similar argument can be made regarding intermale aggression. If a male exhibits a higher display rate than a competitor despite being at- tacked frequently by the competitor, it seems unlikely that the reproduc- tive success of the high-displaying male could be greatly reduced. However, if a high-displaying male also attacks his competitor frequent- ly, one would expect a reduced quality of courtship, length of courtship bouts, etc., of the high-displaying male. If the quality of courtship is reduced, reproductive success should be lower, and I suggest that the top and center rows of Fig. 2 can be combined and compared to the bottom row. With the above assumptions, the four upper left groups (Section A) of Fig. 2 become the control group, Section B combines two groups to test the effects of a high-displaying male having a high-thrusting competitor, and likewise, Section C provides a test for the negative effects of being highly aggressive in addition to exhibiting a higher display rate. A com- parison of sections A and B shows a significant effect of gonopodial thrusting on reproductive success (X2 = 3.87, d.f. = 1, a &lt;0.05), and I conclude that a high-thrusting male can reduce the reproductive success of a high-displaying competitor. A comparison of sections A and C in- dicates a significant reduction in reproductive success as a result of being aggressive (X2 = 8.06, d.f. = 1, a&lt;0.005). Finally, if one combines sections B, C, and D, the result is a combined group of negative effects on reproductive success, and this group is significantly different from the control group A (X2 - 7.69, d.f. = 1, a &lt;0.005). Fig. 3 shows the prob- ability of reproductive success as a function of relative display rate for Section A of Fig. 2 (Fig. 3a) and for Sections B, C, and D combined from Fig. 2 (Fig. 3b).</page><page sequence="22">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 59 100- 95 A 100 o~~~~~~~~~~~~ o 90 2 90 4 85 - ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~90 8o758 80 8 7. 0 70 W 70 (. 65- U~ 65 0 60 V11 60 w 5 50 50 3- 45 (.9 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~45 40 4 Fg 30 30 IX 25 2 20 200 tivit in pouain5ihtomlsadtofmls i.3ersnsalppltosi 10 1 0 4 8 21 36 16 16 36 21 8 4 5 17 103 33 12 12 33 13 17 1 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 '1.

Fig. 3a represents all populations in which the reproductive success of high-displaying males should be either unaffected or enhanced by differences in rate of gonopodial thrusting or intermale aggressiveness, and Fig. 3B represents all populations in which the high-displaying male exhibited significant- ly more aggression and/or less gonopodial thrusting than a competitor. Within each bar is the total number of broods produced by females in that percentage class. The diagonal line represents reproductive success if it is dependent only on the probability of encounter- ing a receptive female. Conclusions. 1. The reproductive success of a high-displaying male is reduced if a competitor exhibits a higher rate of gonopodial thrusting. 2. The reproductive success of a high-displaying male is not reduced if a competitor is more aggressive, but it is reduced if he himself is more ag- gressive. 7. The relationship between aggression and the display rate of a competitor. The above analysis of the effects of aggression on reproductive success showed that if a male displays more than a competitor, he has a higher reproductive success than if he is both high-displaying and high- aggressive. It says nothing about the effects of aggression on the display rate of a competitor. I therefore made the following analysis to determine if aggression affects the display rate of a competitor and thus gives an ag- gressive male a reproductive advantage. One would expect that if aggression can cause a decrease in the display rate of a competitor, there should be more populations observed in which</page><page sequence="23">60 JAMES A. FARR one male is both high-aggressive and high-displaying than those in which one is high-displaying and the other is high-aggressive. If aggression has no effect on the display rate of a competitor, there should be no dif- ferences. In reality, there were 24 populations in which one male showed significantly more aggression and courtship, and 15 in which one male was high-aggressive and the other was high-displaying. The expected number of each if aggression does not affect courtship display rate is 19.5, and a X2 test revealed no deviation from randomness (X2 = 2.08, d.f. = 1, xa&gt;0.05). Conclusion. 1. Males which are significantly more aggressive than a competitor do not exhibit higher display rates and therefore do not gain an advantage by being aggressive. 8. The effects of male coloration on reproductive success. I also examined how male coloration affects reproductive success. Because of the difficulties in trying to quantify coloration, it was necessary to use a subjective method for determining relative con- spicuousness of male color patterns. Fifteen people were shown a representative male of each of the seven strains used in these experiments and were asked to rank the males from the most conspicuous and colorful to the dullest, least colorful individual. For every two strains A and B, I determined how many times A was ranked ahead of B in the fifteen rank orders, and determined by binomial probabilities whether one strain was judged brighter than the other strain significantly more often. Two pairs of strains, Ma-Pa and Cr/Ar-Pa, were not significantly different in relative pattern brightness, and the more conspicuous male in each of the 19 remaining pairs is shown in Table 3. There are two questions about the effects of pigmentation on male mating success. First: Is the degree of coloration correlated with the level of sexual behavior? There were 48 populations in which the male with the most conspicuous coloration exhibited significantly more courtship displays than his competitor, and 36 in which the high-displaying male was the duller of the two. In 11 populations in which differences in pigmentation conspicuousness were observed, there were no significant differences in courtship behavior. If courtship display rate is independent of male coloration, one would expect as many populations in which one male was both high-displaying and more brightly colored as those in which the high-displaying males exhibited the duller coloration, or 42 of</page><page sequence="24">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 61 each (N = 84). There was not a significant difference (X2 - 1. 71, d. f. = 1, ca&gt;0.05), and I conclude that display rate and brightness in coloration are not related. The second question is: Does coloration affect reproductive success in- dependently of sexual behavior? There were 88 broods produced from populations in which one of the males was both high-displaying and more brightly colored, and 62.5 of these (71.02 %) were sired by the high- displaying male. Of the 57 broods produced from populations in which duller males exhibited a higher display rate, 45 (78.95%) were sired by the high-displaying males. Thus, dull males with higher display rates were actually slightly more successful in inseminating females than were bright males with high display rates, although the difference is not signifi- cant (X2 = 1.14, d.f. = 1, ao&gt;0.05). Coloration alone appears not to af- fect reproductive success, and relative display rate continues to be the best indicator of potential reproductive success. In the above analysis, all pairs of strains in which one strain was deter- mined to be brighter than another and in which one strain possessed wild-type background coloration and the other was homozygous for at least one recessive gene affecting background coloration, the wild-type strain was judged to be more conspicuous. I therefore divided the seven strains into a bright group (Ist, Ma, Pa, and Ni/Fil) and a dull group (Ma/gg, Cr/Ar, and Bl/Ir) and performed a second analysis of the effects of coloration on sexual behavior and reproductive success using only bright males paired with dull males. This more conservative estimate of which strains are more colorful leaves only those pairs of strains with greater differences in coloration. All pairs with two bright or two dull males were excluded, as was the pair Pa-Cr/Ar, which was not judged to be different in the first analysis. In 34 of the 55 populations remaining for analysis, the brighter males exhibited higher displays rates than the duller males. In only 17 popula- tions was the dull male high-displaying, and in four populations, no dif- ferences in courtship behavior were observed. There were significantly more high-displaying bright males than expected (X2 = 5.67, d.f. = 1, a &lt;0.025), and I conclude from this analysis that there is a positive cor- relation between color pattern conspicuousness and courtship display rate. There were 63 broods produced from populations in which one male was both bright in coloration and high-displaying, and 43.5 (69.05%) were sired by that male. Of 22 broods produced from populations in which a dull male was high-displaying, 18 (81.82%) were sired by the high-displaying male. The difference between the two proportions is not</page><page sequence="25">62 JAMES A. FARR significant (X2 = 1.33, d.f. = 1, a&gt;O0.05), and I conclude that even when differences in coloration between two competing males are very great, coloration does not affect the advantage to displaying at a higher rate than a competitor. Conclusions. 1. Unless the differences in coloration are very great, there is no cor- relation between color pattern conspicuousness and courtship display rate. 2. If there is a greater difference in coloration between two males, brighter males tend to exhibit higher display rates. 3. Coloration does not affect male reproductive success independently of courtship display rate; high-displaying but dull males are equally as successful as those which are both more brightly colored and more sex- ually active. 9. Multiple inseminations and female unanimity in choice of males. A final consideration of male mating success and female choice in populations with two males and two females concerns multiple mating and female unanimity in mate selection. With regard to the first point, only 15 of 183 females (8.20%) produced broods sired by both males. This is probably an underestimate of the actual rate of multiple insemina- tions because some broods were very small and the probability of not detecting the offspring of a second male was high. However, under these experimental conditions, the frequency of inseminations by both males was only in the neighborhood of ten percent. In 80 of the 105 populations observed, both females produced (male) offspring. In 53 of these (66.25%), both females produced young from the same male only. In 15 of the populations (18.75 %), each female pro- duced young from a different male. In 10 populations (12.50%), both females produced offspring from one male, and one female also produced offspring sired by the second male. Finally, in two populations (2.50%), both females produced young from both males. Thus, in a total of 65 populations (81.25%), one male sired all or a portion of the broods of both females. If one assumes that mating is random, there should be an equal number of populations in which both females mated with the same male and those in which each female mated with a different male (ignoring multiple inseminations). In the 68 populations in which both females pro-</page><page sequence="26">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 63 duced male offspring and neither female was inseminated by both males, one should expect 34 populations to fall into each category. However, there were 53 populations in which the females were unanimous in their choice and only 15 in which each mated with a different male, and this is highly significantly different from random (X2 = 21.24, d.f. = 1, a &lt; 0.005). I conclude that mating is not random, that females exercise a choice of males, and that the criteria for choosing a male are relatively in- variable among females. In populations in which both females mated with one male and the sec- ond male either sired no offspring or shared one broad, it can be assum- ed that the more successful male was usually preferred by the females. One can thus ask if there were differences in behavior between unprefer- red males which sired no offspring and those which shared one brood with the preferred males. In particular, one might expect that the more successful unpreferred males exhibited higher rates of gonopodial thrusting and hence bypassed female choice mechanisms. The average number of gonopodial thrusts per 50 min exhibited by unpreferred males which sired no offspring was 13.34 (S.E. = 2.00, N = 53). Unpreferred males which shared one brood with the more successful male averaged 21. 10 thrusts per 50 min (S.E. = 4.61, N = 10). A comparison of the two means showed that partially successful unpreferred males exhibited higher rates of gonopodial thrusting (t = 1.68, a &lt;0.05), and I conclude that inseminations by gonopodial thrusting do not agree with female preferences and that they reduce the average mating success of preferred males. Conclusions. 1. Females were usually inseminated by a single male; multiple in- seminations were detected in only 8.20% of the females observed. 2. In 81.25% of the populations observed, one male sired all or a por- tion of the broods of both females. This suggests that females choose males and that the criteria for the choice are relatively invariable. 3. Further evidence is provided that unpreferred males which exhibit high levels of gonopodial thrusting reduce the reproductive success of preferred males by bypassing female choice mechanisms.</page><page sequence="27">64 JAMES A. FARR B. POPULATIONS WITH TEN MALES FROM TWO DIFFERENT STRAINS AND TEN FEMALES - FURTHER EXPERIMENTS ON MALE MATING SUC- CESS AND ON THE EFFECTS OF POSSESSING A RARE COLOR PATTERN The following experiment was designed primarily to investigate fur- ther whether males with a rare color pattern have an advantage in mating, as I suggested earlier (FARR, 1977). In addition, it was possible to infer more about the determinants of male reproductive success and female choice from the control populations in which two strains of males occurred with equal frequencies. Four series were run, each using a different pair of male strains. All populations consisted of ten females and ten males, with all females being from a different strain than the two male strains. In the control popula- tions, each male strain was represented by five males, and in all but one replicate (3AA in Table 4), each male was observed for 10 min, and the mean numbers of courtship displays, gonopodial thrusts, and aggressive attacks were calculated for each strain. To test the effects of male rarity, the reproductive success of the two strains in ratios of 1:9 and 9:1 in the parental populations was examined. 1. Reproductive success as a function of male behavior and coloration: control populations. I compared the behavior of the two strains in five of the six control populations by means of Wilcoxon's rank sum test (HOLLANDER &amp; WOLFE, 1973), with the intention of correlating reproductive success and relative frequency of social behavior patterns. However, there were surprisingly few differences observed (Table 4), although this is probably attributable in part to low sample sizes and the increased variance in behavior with higher population densities (FARR &amp; HERRNKIND, 1974). The behavior and reproductive success of each strain are shown in Table 4. Because of the similarity of both strains in all populations, it is difficult to find correlates between behavior and reproductive success. In popula- tion lA, Ist males exhibited a marginally significantly higher rate of gonopodial thrusting, and Pa exhibited slightly more aggression, and as would be predicted from the results of the first experiments, Ist males sired more broods than Pa (difference not significant). In population 2A, Ma males exhibited marginally significantly higher rates of courtship display than Ist, but in 2AA there were no differences. Contrary to ex- pectations, Ist was more successful than Ma (X2 = 8.45, d.f. = 1, ae &amp;lt; 0.005, both populations combined). In population 3A, Pa exhibited a</page><page sequence="28">TABLE 4 0 A summary of the behavior and reproductive success of male guppies, Poecilia reticulata, in six P populations with ten males, five from each of two strains, and ten females Population Females Males No. displays No. thrusts No. aggressive No. broods z per 10 min per 10 min attacks sired by per 10 min males Cd IA Ma/gg Ist 11.4 4.8* 0.2 5.5 H Pa 12.2 2.6 1.0* 3.5 2A Pa Ma 14.0* 4.4 0.8 1.5 Ist 10.2 4.2 0.2 8.5 2AA X X Ma 14.4 2.2 0.2 2.0 &gt; 0 0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~z Ist 14.0 4.6 0.2 8.0 3 3A Sm/Ir Ma 15.6 3.2 2.4 5.0 O Pa 12.8 5.4* 0.0 1.0 t 3AA X X Ma - 7.0 t Pa - 1.0 4A X X Ma 14.0 2.0 0.0 7.0 0 Ni/Fil 8.0 3.6** 0.2 2.0 * Greater than that of competitor strain, 0.05 &lt; a &lt;0.075, Wilcoxon rank sum test. ** Greater than that of competitor strain, a &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test. tt n CQ n!

The combined results of the two replicates in- dicated a much higher success rate for Ma (X2 = 7.14, d. f. = 1, a &amp;lt; 0. 01). Finally, in population 4A, Ni/Fil males showed higher rates of gonopodial thrusting than Ma males, but Ma was more successful in mating (difference not significant). Because the behavior of the different strains in each population was so similar, it is possible that coloration might have been the determining fac- tor in reproductive success. In populations IA, 2A, and 2AA, Ist males were the most brightly colored and the most successful in siring offspring. In populations 3A and 3AA, neither strain was judged to be more color- ful, so the reason for the greater success of Ma males is unknown. Final- ly, in population 4A, Ni/Fil males were more colorful than Ma males, but Ma was more successful. It is likely that differences in courtship display rates accounted for the higher success of Ma and that low sample size did not allow detection of the differences. I conclude that differences in relative male color pattern conspicuousness may determine male mating success in the absence of behavioral differences, but the evidence is weak. Eight of the 52 broods (15.38%) produced in the six populations were sired by both strains, a proportion not significantly different from that observed in the populations with two males and two females (X2 = 2.36, d.f. = 1, cx&gt;0.05). 45 of the 52 females (86.54%) were inseminated by the more successful males in the different populations, a figure roughly equivalent to the 81.25% of the populations in the first experiment in which all or a portion of the broods of both females were sired by a single male. This is further evidence that females exercise a choice of males, and, as in the first experiments, there appears to be little variation among females in the criteria for choosing a male. Conclusions. 1. Behavioral differences between strains in populations with ten females and five males of each of two strains were very slight, and repro- ductive success could not be correlated with behavioral differences. 2. Weak evidence suggests that male coloration might determine male mating success in the absence of behavioral differences. 3. Multiple inseminations were rare, and evidence is presented to in- dicate further that females are almost unanimous in choice of males.</page><page sequence="30">TABLE 5 A summary of the reproductive success of competing strains of guppies in a test offrequency-dependent mate selection Population Males Females No. broods E E Observed produced No. broods sired by each strain O IB 9 Pa: Ma/gg 8 7.2 Pa: 6.8 Pa: 6.0 Pa: x 1 Ists 0.8 Ist 1.2 Ist 2.0 Ist &gt; IC 9 Ist: Ma/gg 7 6.3 Ist: 6.5 Ist: 4.0 Ist: H I Paw 0.7 Pa 0.5 Pa 3.0 Pa ".2 2B 9 Ma: Pa 10 9.0 Ma: 6.6 Ma: 3.5 Ma: Z 1 ists 1.0 Ist 3.4 Ist 6.5 Ist' 2 2C 9 Ist: Pa 8 7.2 Ist: 7.8 Ist: 6.0 Ist: 1 Maw 0.8 Ma 0.2 Ma 2.0 Ma2 3B 9 Ma: Sm/Ir 9 8.1 Ma: 6.5 Ma: 1 Paw 0.9 Pa 2.5 Pa 3BB 9 Ma: X X 10 9.0 Ma: 6.0 Ma: 1 Paw 1.0 Pa 4.0 Pa &gt; 3B + 3BB 19 17.1 Ma: 18.6 Ma: 12.5 Ma: H 1.9 Pa 0.4 Pa 6.5 Pal "2 0 3C 9 Pa: Sm/Ir 10 9.0 Pa: 9.5 Pa: 1 Mas 1.0 Ma 0.5 Ma 3CC 9 Pa: X X 10 9.0 Pa: 7.0 Pa: 1 Mas " 1.0 Ma 3.0 Ma 3C + 3CC 20 18.0 Pa: 12.0 Pa: 16.5 Pa: 2.0 Ma 8.0 Ma 3.5 Ma2 4B 9 Ma: X X 10 9.0 Ma: 9.7 Ma: 8.5 Ma: H 1 Ni/Filw 1.0 Ni/Fil 0.3 Ni/Fil 1.5 Ni/Fil' 4C 9 Ni/Fil: X X 8 7.2 Ni/Fil: 5.8 Ni/Fil: 2.5 Ni/Fil: t/ 1 Mas 0.8 Ma 2.2 Ma 5.5 Ma' 2 Rare males are designated strong (s) or weak (w) depending on their relative performances in control popula- tions.

Frequency-dependent mating success. The results of the experiments on the advantage of carrying a rare col- or pattern are outlined in Table 5. In each pair of strains the rare male was designated "strong" or "weak", depending on the relative success of the two strains in the control populations. The strong strain sired the most broods in the control populations regardless of whether the in- terstrain differences were significant. Two expected ratios of numbers of offspring of each strain were calculated for each series. El is the expected ratio of offspring produced given the frequency of occurrence of the two strains and thus was always a 9:1 ratio of broods produced by the com- mon and rare males, respectively. A second expected number of offspring (E2) was calculated by taking into account the relative strengths of the two strains in the control populations. When a strong strain was rare, E1 was less than E2, and when a weak strain was rare, E2 was less than El. Two replicates were run for each combination of'Ma and Pa (Series 3), and the expected ratios of offspring were calculated only for the combined results (i.e., 3B and 3BB combined and 3C and 3CC combined). The ratio E2 was calculated from the results of both control populations com- bined in Series 2 and 3. The observed results of the different crosses were compared to the expected ratios by X2 test, with an accepted significance level of 0.05. For a female preference for rare males to maintain a polymorphism, the observed reproductive success must be greater than predicted from the frequency of occurrence of that strain. If observed success is greater than predicted from E2, but less than that from El, a weak frequency- dependent effect is shown, but it is insufficient to maintain a polymor- phism. This is no problem if a strong strain is rare, because inherent strength alone could result in a reproductive success greater than the fre- quency of occurrence. It is therefore important to analyse the weak and strong strains separately. In four of the eight combinations of strains the rare male sired more offspring than was expected given the relative frequency of occurrence of the two strains (E1). In two of these (2B and 4C), the strong strain was rare; the weak strain was rare in the remaining two (IC and 3B + 3BB). The rare male sired more offspring than expected given the relative strength of the two strains in the controls (E2) in six of the eight combina- tions - all four in which the weak strain was rare (IC, 2C, 3B + 3BB, and 4B), and two in which the strong strain was rare (2B and 4C). In populations 3C and 3CC, the strong strain (Ma) was rare and sired significantly fewer offspring than expected from E2.</page><page sequence="32">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 69 A combined analysis of the effects of rarity on mating success gave the following results. There were 46 broods produced from populations in which the strong strain was rare. Of these, 17.5 (38.04%) were sired by the rare male, and this is significantly greater than expected given fre- quency of occurrence (X2 = 40.20, d.f. = 1, a&lt;0.001). 44 broods were produced from populations in which the weak strain was rare, and the rare male sired 13 of these (29.55%). This also exceeds the expected number given relative frequencies of occurrence (X2 = 18.68, d.f. = 1, a &lt;0.005). A total of 30.5 broods were sired by rare males in the 90 broods produced in the entire experiment (33.89%), and it can be con- cluded that males with rare color patterns have an advantage in mating given expected success with panmixia, and that the frequency-dependent effect is strong enough to maintain a polymorphism in color pattern in the populations. When a strong strain was rare, 7 of the 46 broods produced (15.22%) were sired by both strains. This is not significantly different from the pro- portion of multiple matings in the control populations (X2 = 0.01, d.f. = 1, a &gt;0.05) or in the populations with two males and two females (X2 = 2.09, d.f. = 1, a&gt; 0.05). When a weak strain was rare, ten of the 44 resulting broods (22.73%) contained males of both strains. This is not different from the controls (X2 = 0.84, d.f. = 1, a &gt; 0.05), but significant- ly exceeds the frequency of multiple matings in the first experiments (X2 = 7.62, d.f. = 1, a&lt;0.01). These data suggest that when a weak or less preferred strain is rare, there is a higher tendency for females to mate with more than one male, and as will be explained below, this could be important in determining the mechanism by which frequency dependent mating success occurs. For these populations with biased strain ratios, one must finally con- sider the number of inseminations achieved by rare and common strains. When a strong strain was rare, all or a portion of 32 of the 46 broods (69.57 % were sired by the common (weak) male, and 21 of the 46 broods (45.65%) were sired completely or partially by the rare (strong) male. The proportion of broods sired at least in part by the common males was significantly less than that sired by the strong males in the control popula- tions (86.54%: X2 = 4.1 7, d.f. = 1, a &lt; 0.05), thus indicating that there is less unanimity in female choice when a weak strain outnumbers a strong strain 9 to 1 than when the two strains are represented in equal propor- tions. However, when a weak strain was rare, 36 of the 44 broods (81 .82 % ) were sired in part or totally by the common (strong) strain, and 18 of the 44 (40.91 %) contained at least some males of the rare (weak)</page><page sequence="33">70 JAMES A. FARR strain. There is no difference between these populations and the control populations in the proportion of females inseminated by the strong strain (X2 = 0.40, d.f. = 1, a &gt;0.05), and there is no difference in the propor- tion of females inseminated by a rare weak strain and by a rare strong strain (X2 = 0.21, d.f. = 1, a&gt;0.05). Thus, it appears that when a weak strain is rare, as many females mate with the strong strain as in the con- trol populations, and that the frequency-dependent mating effect is achieved through an increase in multiple matings. When a strong strain is rare, female preferences for that strain tend to reduce the majority ad: vantage of the weak strain, and the frequency-dependent effect is achieved strictly by the greater preference for males of the rare strain. Conclusions. 1. In populations with two male strains represented in ratios of 9:1, the rare males sired significantly more than 10% of the offspring, even if they were less preferred strains in the control populations. 2. If a more preferred strain was rare, the frequency-dependent effect was achieved strictly by female preference for that strain, thereby resulting in fewer matings with the common, less preferred strain. 3. If a less preferred strain was rare, there was no reduction in the number of matings by the common strain. The frequency-dependent ef- fect was achieved by an increase in the number of inseminations by both strains. C. POPULATIONS WITH TEN MALES FROM FIVE DIFFERENT STRAINS AND TEN FEMALES A final experiment was run with populations of ten virgin X,X, females and ten males, two each from the strains Ma, Cr/Ar, Pa, Ni/Fil, and Bl/Ir. Three replicates were run. Each male was observed for 10 min, and the mean number of courtship displays, gonopodial thrusts, and aggressive attacks made per male per 10 min was calculated for each strain. The results are shown in Table 6. The behavior of the five strains was compared by means of the Kruskal-Wallis distribution-free test for dif- ferences among multiple treatments (HOLLANDER &amp; WOLFE, 1973). There were significant differences among strains in mean number of courtship displays (H' = 24.71, a&lt; 0.001), but not in mean number of gonopodial thrusts (H' = 8.93, oX &gt; 0.05) or number of aggressive attacks (H' = 6.43, x&gt;0.05). Because differences were observed only in level of courtship</page><page sequence="34">TABLE 6 H A summary of the social behavior and reproductive success of male guppies, Poecilia reticulata, in popula- tions with ten males, two from each offive strains, and ten females Strain Mean no.

FARR display activity, this is the only factor which could be examined with regard to its effect on reproductive success. If the probability of inseminating a female is correlated with relative display rate as shown in the above experiments, one would expect the number of broods produced by each strain to be determined by the pro- portion of the total courtship activity exhibited by each strain. Table 6 shows the observed number of broods produced by each strain and the expected number of broods which should be produced by each strain given relative courtship display frequencies (N = 29 broods). A com- parison of the two distributions revealed no significant differences be- tween observed and expected (X2 = 0.81, d.f. = 4, a &gt;0.05), and the hypothesis that relative display rate is the primary determinant of male reproductive success is corroborated. Unlike the populations with two male strains, there was much multiple insemination in these polymorphic populations. Ten females produced broods sired by two different strains, and four females produced broods sired by three strains. Thus, 14 of the 29 broods (48.28%) resulted from inseminations by more than one strain. All 14 broods from multiple in- seminations contained either Ma or Ar offspring (the two highest- displaying strains), and 7 of the 14 contained both Ma and Ar males. The proportion of broods from multiple inseminations significantly surpassed that observed in the populations with two males and two females (X2 = 34.02, d.f. = 1, a &lt; 0.001) and in the populations with ten females and five males from each of two strains (X2 = 10. 17, d. f. = 1, o &lt; 0.005). There was also no clear indication of female unanimity in preference for males. Ma males inseminated 14 females (48.28%: 5 whole broods and 9 shared with at least one other strain), and Cr/Ar males inseminated 15 females (51.72 %: 4 whole broods and 11 shared broods). Ni/Fil males inseminated 8 females (27.59%: 3 whole broods, 5 shared), Bl/Ir males inseminated 4 females (13.79%: 1 whole brood, 3 shared), and Pa males inseminated 6 females (2 whole broods, 4 shared). More females were in- seminated by Cr/Ar males than any other strain, but the proportion was significantly lower than the proportion of females inseminated by the strong strains in the populations with ten females and five males from each of two strains (X2 = 11.73, d.f. = 1, a&lt;0.005). I conclude that females did not exhibit as strong a prefernce for a single strain as was observed in populations with two strains. Conclusions. 1. In populations with ten females and two males from each of five dif- ferent strains. male remroductive success was positively correlated with</page><page sequence="36">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 73 relative display rate, the only behavior pattern for which interstrain dif- ferences were found. 2. Multiple inseminations were much more frequent than in popula- tions with only two male strains, and all broods resulting from multiple matings contained at least one of the two most sexually active strains. 3. There was much less evidence of female unanimity in choice of males than in populations with only two male strains. DISCUSSION This study examined how several factors affect reproductive success of male guppies, Poecilia reticulata; the factors fall into three groups, each of which must be examined separately. The first group is male sexual behavior, specifically the rates at which males court females and with which males attempt to inseminate females in the absence of a receptive behavior. The second category is intermale aggression. Finally, I shall discuss two aspects of male sexual coloration - color pattern con- spicuousness and color pattern frequency - with regard to male reproductive success. As I discuss each factor, I will construct an evolu- tionary model accounting for the various features of guppy social behavior. The model will be simplified, in that it will assume a sequential addition of the different features of behavior and coloration rather than a simultaneous evolution of several phenotypic traits. In some instances this will be justified, and in others it is meant only as a convenience for explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the traits in question. It is obvious from the above data that the rate at which males court females relative to those of other males is the most important determinant of reproductive success. I hypothesized earlier (FARR, 1975, 1976) that a high display rate was advantageous; that males alter their courtship display rates in response to different competitive situations instead of displaying always at maximum capability (FARR &amp; HERRNKIND, 1974; FARR, 1976 and present study) indicates that relative rather than absolute rates of courtship display determine how successfully a male will in- seminate females. Because the average reproductive success of high- displaying males was greater than expected from the probability of meeting a receptive female, I conclude that females compare the display rates of potential mates and choose the vigorous ones. A male must display only noticeably more often than a competitor, and displaying at maximum capability is wasteful if a lower display rate suffices to exceed that of a less active competitor.</page><page sequence="37">74 JAMES A. FARR The phylogeny of the relationship between display rate and reproduc- tive success was probably a two-step process. After the development of a display-response system, mating was probably random. A male phenotype A which exhibited more courtship activity that a phenotype B would encounter more receptive females by chance alone and would therefore sire more offspring. Once selection begins to force an increase in rate of courtship display, however, it becomes advantageous for females to exert a preference for more vigorous males. Suppose there are two male phenotypes A and B which account for 60% and 40% of the total courtship activity in a population, respectively. Suppose further that there is a female phenotype C which mates with any available male when she is receptive, and a female phenotype D which prefers high-displaying males, in this case A males. Although A males have the advantage in both cases, D females would eventually replace C females for the follow- ing reason. The randomly-mating C females would produce on the average 60% A offspring and 40% B offspring, but the D females would produce a much higher proportion of A males and thus a much lower proportion of the low-displaying B males. A higher proportion of the off- spring of D females would be successful in the next generation than would that of C females, so a preference for high-displaying males would result. One can conclude that display rate itself is a sexually selected character. Selection has resulted in a maximization of male courtship display rate in natural populations, with physiological and time-budget considera- tions providing the upper limits and predation pressure exerting a negative pressure on male courtship activity (FARR, 1975). That between population variation in courtship activity is high (FARR, 1975) and that inbred strains exhibit significantly different levels of display activity (FARR, 1976 and the present study) suggest that heritability is high (EHRMAN &amp; PARSONS, 1976), and that response to selection should be fast (FISHER, 1930). The result should be a rapid approach to equilibrium in any population with little within-population variability. If all males then exhibit identical display rates, mating again becomes random, and the opportunity for the evolution of "tie-breakers" arises. The first of these tie-breakers is gonopodial thrusting, or attempting to inseminate a female without her acceptance and cooperation. CLARK &amp; ARONSON (1951) concluded that most gonopodial thrusts do not result in insemination, and LILEY (1966) felt that most inseminations in guppies resulted from courtship display - female response - copulation se- quences, and very few from gonopodial thrusting. I believe that the fre- quency of inseminations resulting from gonopodial thrusting is greater</page><page sequence="38">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 75 and more significant than heretofore realized, and the results of the above authors must be qualified. First, while CLARK &amp; ARONSON'S (1951) con- clusions regarding the absolute frequency of successful inseminations through thrusting are certainly correct, it is important to note that the ab- solute frequency of copulation success as a result of displaying is also very low (FARR &amp; HERRNKIND, 1974; FARR, 1975). Second, LILEY (1966) observed males with highly receptive virgin females, and thus his ex- perimental design was biased in favor of courtship displays (as is mine: see below). Female guppies are receptive to male displays during a 3-5 day period after birth of a brood, the time when new ripe ova are ready to be fertiliz- ed, and during the remaining 80-90% of the 30-day brood cycle are unresponsive to male courtship (LILEY, 1968). During the unreceptive portion of the cycle, inseminations can occur only through gonopodial thrusting. Sperm can be stored for several months (HILDEMANN &amp; WAGNER, 1954; BAERENDS et al., 1955), so a successful insemination dur- ing any portion of the brood cycle can result in production of offspring. However, sperm decreases in viability with age (WINGE, 1937; HILDEMANN &amp; WAGNER, 1954), so the closer an insemination is to the receptive and fertile portion of the female's brood cycle, the higher will be the proportion of that male's contribution to the next brood, and thus the best strategy a male can adopt is to spend as much time as possible displaying to females and being accepted during the female's fertile period. So how is gonopodial thrusting effective? Consider the following. If two male phenotypes A and B exhibit iden- tical display rates, they should successfully inseminate equal numbers of females and neither should have a selective advantage. However, if A males also attempt to inseminate females without their cooperation, a certain proportion p of these gonopodial thrusts will also be successful. Thus, pN females will carry sperm resulting both from a true copulation with either an A or a B male and from a forced insemination by an A male. This would have no effect on the N/2 females which accepted a display of an A male, but those females which copulated with B males would produce mixed broods. The overall reproductive success of A males (RSA) and B males (RSB) would thus be as follows: RSA = N/2 + cpN/2 = N(1 + cp)/2 RSB = N/2 - cpN/2 = N(1 - cp)/2 where c is the proportion of offspring in mixed broods sired by A males. Each male "earns" N/2 broods, but A males increase their net reproduc- tive success by "stealing" an additional cp broods from B males. Even-</page><page sequence="39">76 JAMES A. FARR tually, B males would be eliminated and the resulting situation would be a population comprised wholly of males which exhibit both courtship displays and gonopodial thrusting. The proportion p of females inseminated by gonopodial thrusting is limited by time-budget considerations. If a male exhibits too high a rate of gonopodial thrusting, he will suffer a reduction in courtship display rate. Females would then exhibit preferences for the higher displaying males, and the reproductive success of the two types would be N(1 - cp) and cpN, respectively. If a male adopted a strategy only of gonopodial thrusting and was so efficient that all females were inseminated (p = 1), then the two reproductive successes would reduce to cN and N(1 - c). Because males which achieve copulations through the display-acceptance route should generally account for a higher proportion of offspring in a mixed brood, it should follow that c&lt;0.5, and the pure strategy of gonopodial thrusting could not exist in competition with a pure display- ing strategy. A mixed strategy of display and thrust is better than either pure strategy, however. Because most species of poeciliid exhibit no true courtship display, but rather rely on gonopodial thrusting entirely, the above phylogeny is prob- ably reversed (i.e., courtship did not precede thrusting). However, the conclusions drawn are not altered, and the equilibrium situations described above are not affected by the starting point. As long as court- ship display results in a higher proportion of a mixed brood than gonopodial thrusting, selection will maximize display rate and retain thrusting as a tie-breaker. A hypothesis concerning the selective forces leading to the evolution of courtship displays in poeciliids is incorporated below in the discussion of the evolution of male sexual coloration. It should be noted that my own experimental design probably tended to underestimate the extent to which gonopodial thrusting is important in reproductive success. Males were always presented to virgin females, and the data on reproductive success were usually obtained from first broods. Even though virgins may exhibit an ovarian cycle, most will respond im- mediately to male displays (LILEY &amp; WISHLOW, 1974). If ripe ova were present at the onset of the experiment, a gonopodial thrust must have been successful during a reduced portion of the brood cycle for it to be ex- pressed in the first offspring. In a normal population consisting mostly of gravid females, gonopodial thrusting could occur throughout the entire brood cycle. In my experiments, p is probably underestimated, but c was probably greater than would be expected under normal conditions.</page><page sequence="40">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 77 The effects of intermale aggression on reproductive success in guppies are complex. My hypothesis was that aggression does not increase male reproductive success, and this was based on my own observations that in- termale aggression is virtually non-existent in natural (FARR, 1975) and laboratory (FARR &amp; HERRNKIND, 1974) guppy populations. My reasoning was basically that if aggression were somehow important, one would see more of it. Contrary to my ideas, GANDOLFI (1971) and GORLICK (1976) believed intermale aggression in guppies positively influences reproduc- tive success. GORLICK (1976) merely quantified aggressive behavior and described dominance hierarchies in small laboratory populations, and he found that dominant males exhibited more copulation attempts than subordinate males in populations with two males and two females in 38 1 aquaria (identical to my experimental conditions); neither courtship display activity nor reproductive success were measured, so his conclu- sions as to the adaptiveness of aggression are based on the fact that he saw aggression and its relation to one aspect of sexual behavior. GANDOLFI (1971), on the other hand, used genetic markers and showed that dominant males did indeed sire more offspring than subordinate males. He began his experiments with two males in 5.0 1 aquaria, allow- ed them to form dominance relationships, and then transferred them to 15 1 aquaria. Once it was determined that the hierarchy still persisted, he presented each population with a series of six albino females (Albino is an autosomal recessive gene; the males were one albino and one homozygous wild-type), and then determined which males successfully inseminated the females. Sexual behavior was not quantified, but albino males were dominant in as many replicates as they were subordinate, and no strain-specific effects were observed. Dominant males were signifi- cantly more effective in mating. My results indicated 1) that aggressive males did not affect the court- ship display rates of their competitors, and 2) that high-displaying males were less successful in reproduction if they were more aggressive than a competitor than if they were equally aggressive or less aggressive than a competitor. This is completely contrary to GANDOLFI'S results, so perhaps it is necessary to compare the experimental methods of the two investiga- tions to find a possible resolution. GANDOLFI allowed the males in his experiment to form dominance relationships before he introduced the females, while I added males to the females. It is possible that copulations in my experiments occurred before the effects of aggression could be observed, but this would not explain the negative effects of aggression in my experiments. It is also possible that</page><page sequence="41">78 JAMES A. FARR the males I observed as being high-aggressive and high-displaying ex- hibited different behavior at the time copulations were occurring. In par- ticular, if dominance was not yet established when copulations took place, the aggressive males could have been much more aggressive and much less sexually active than when I observed them, and the sequence of addition of males and females could explain the results. Another source of the differences in results could be the size of the aquaria used. My aquaria were 7.5 x larger than those GANDOLFI used for establishing the dominance relationships and 2.5 x larger than those he used for introducing females to the males. One would expect that the smaller the aquarium (i.e., the higher the population density), the lower would be the chance for a less aggressive male to escape an aggressive male. Investigations of the effects of population density on guppy behavior have shown an increase in aggression with crowding (WARREN, 1973; FARR &amp; HERRNKIND, 1974), and it is possible that the level of ag- gression in GANDOLFI'S populations was higher than in mine and that the chance for escape was lower. A final source of the differences between my results and GANDOLFI'S could be the females themselves. GANDOLFI used only Albino females, and I used females from several strains. Albino females might prefer more aggressive males, but since there are no data, I cannot consider this possibility. It is also possible that because of the albino condition, GAN- DOLFI's females had poor vision and could not respond to visual displays. GORLICK (1976) found a positive correlation between aggression and gonopodial thrusting, and my data support this. (In 17 populations of two males and two females, one male was more aggressive and exhibited more thrusting than the competitor. In only five was one male high- aggressive and the other high-thrusting.) If inseminations in GANDOLFI'S experiments were primarily from gonopodial thrusting because of reduc- ed sensory capabilities of the females, our results are not comparable. On theoretical grounds one would not expect a positive effect of inter- male aggression in guppies. For intermale aggression to be profitable, ag- gressive males must be able to prevent less aggressive males from court- ing females, and thus aggression must be severe enough that some males behave subordinately. Generally, dominance relationships in poeciliids are determined by relative size of the individuals (BRADDOCK, 1945; BAIRD, 1968; MCKAY, 1971; CONSTANTZ, 1975; SOHN, 1977), large in- dividuals being dominant. In guppies, however, within-population varia- tion in size is low, and size of males is determined primarily through selection by predators and environmental temperature (SEGHERS, 1973;</page><page sequence="42">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 79 LILEY &amp; SEGHERS, 1975). With no clear size advantages in agonistic in- teractions, most individuals would probably be evenly matched in an agonistic contest, and aggressive bouts would be very lengthy before a clear winner was determined. Reproductive success is determined primarily by female choice of high- displaying males, so consider a population comprised of non-aggressive A phenotypes and aggressive B phenotypes. A males would not interact with other A males, but rather would devote their time to courtship. If an A male met a B male, B would attack, but A would flee and continue to court females. If two B males met, a lengthy fight would ensue. This is essentially the hawk-dove model used by MAYNARD SMITH &amp; PRICE (1973) in their initial formulation of the concept of evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) with the following modification. Because the contests are basically symmetric, an escalated fight would consume too much time which could otherwise be used in pursuit of females. Thus, A males would generally spend more time courting than would B males, and females would choose mostly A males as mates. Aggressive B males should be eliminated very rapidly. Instead of an ESS of a population of aggressive and non-aggressive males, only the non-aggressive males would persist because of the inherent cost of aggression measured directly in terms of relative numbers of females inseminated. My observation showed neither a positive nor a negative effect of ag- gression on courtship display rate, probably because of inherent dif- ferences in display and aggression propensities among the strains as a result of inbreeding. However, time-budget considerations could still ex- plain the negative effects of aggression if aggressive males devoted more time to fighting and less time to courthip at the time copulations were occurring, as explained above. It is also probable that more aggressive males have a lower courtship display quality. It is likely that an ag- gressive male will interrupt a courtship bout or otherwise reduce the quality of a courtship display if he is continually distracted by the presence of a competitor, and even if he displays at a higher rate than a competitor, the stimulus strength of the displays might be reduced. The reproductive success of high-displaying males should be reduced if they are also high-aggressive, and a high-displaying male which is not ag- gressive should be chosen by females regardless of whether a competitor male is non-aggressive or high-aggressive. This was the reasoning used above for combining the top and center rows of Fig. 2. I conclude that aggression in guppies is basically a disadvantageous behavior pattern and that it could only persist 1) if it could successfully</page><page sequence="43">80 JAMES A. FARR diminish the rate of courtship display of non-aggressive males, or 2) if females ceased to choose males on the basis of courtship display rate or began to choose them on the basis of their aggressive capabilities. Both of these factors could possibly account for the positive effects of aggression in GANDOLFI'S (1971) experiments, but normally, particularly in large populations, these exceptions do not exist. Hence, one finds a reduced amount of aggression in nature. The next factor to be considered as a determinant of male reproductive success is the conspicuousness of male secondary sexual coloration. HASKINs et al. (1961) conducted two sets of experiments from which they concluded that brighter males were more successful in mating. In the first experiment, they observed the reproductive success of Pauper, which they considered to be a dull strain, when it was in competition with either Maculatus or Armatus, two bright strains, and the bright strains were significantly more successful in inseminating females. In the second ex- periment, a colorless sex-reversed (XX) male was tested with a brighter strain, and the brighter strain was more successful. In neither experiment was social behavior observed, and the conclusion that coloration itself in- fluenced mating success is not necessarily justified. Pauper males exhibit less sexual activity than Maculatus or Armatus (FARR, 1976: the fish observed were kindly donated by Dr HASKINS himself), so courtship display rate could have been the determining factor. One might also expect that a sex-reversed male would not exhibit normal behavior. It should also be pointed out that Maculatus males were not judged to be brighter that Pauper males in the present experiments, although the Pauper strain in our laboratory in Germany is more brightly pigmented than that obtained from Dr HASKINS' laboratory. Armatus wild-type males were not used in the present experiments. My experiments could detect little, if any, effect of color pattern brightness on reproductive success of males. Females prefer dull but high-displaying males over brightly pigmented but low-displaying males. In populations with ten females and ten males in which two male. strains exhibited similar rates of social behavior, coloration may have been the deciding factor in determining mating success, but the results are not overwhelmingly convincing. If male coloration does influence mating success, it certainly does not offset or increase the advantage to displaying at a higher rate than a competitor, and one must conclude that colora- tion, like gonopodial thrusting, serves at best as a tie-breaker for times when males court females with equal intensity. However, while gonopodial thrusting is a behavior pattern which ignores female choice,</page><page sequence="44">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 81 coloration probably influences choice directly. Thus, coloration is a sex- ually selected tie-breaker. Although brightness in coloration may not be very significant in female choice of males, the frequency of a particular color pattern in a popula- tion appears to be very important. Previously (FARR, 1977), I showed that a new male introduced to an established laboratory population with gravid and normally unreceptive females successfully copulated if he car- ried a color pattern different from that of the original male(s). There was also an indication that rare males had a long-term advantage in mating, a finding supported by the present data. A frequency-dependent mating advantage with regard to color pattern frequency is probably partially responsible for the polymorphism in coloration observed in nature. Two possible mechanisms could account for the rare male advantage. First, females mate preferentially with males carrying less frequent pat- terns, and second, females mate with more than one male, each carrying a different pattern. In invertebrate species in which a rare male advan- tage has been documented, there appears to be an absolute preference for a rare type (PETIT, 1958; PETIT &amp; EHRMAN, 1969; EHRMAN &amp; SPIESS, 1969 for Drosophila spp.; SINNOCK, 1970 for Tribolium; GRANT et al., 1974 for Mormoniella); multiple matings are rare in these species. Olfactory cues appear to be the phenotypic character to which females respond (review- ed by EHRMAN &amp; PROBBER, 1978). In Poecilia reticulata, the only vertebrate for which a possible rare male effect has been documented, both preferences for rare males and the tendency to mate with more than one male seem to account for the observed rare male advantage. Multiple matings were relatively infre- quent in populations with only two strains of males, but were very fre- quent in populations with five male types. In addition, HASKINS et al. (1961) observed a high frequency of multiple inseminations in natural populations of guppies. Multiple inseminations can occur 1) if a female chooses and mates with one male and is inseminated by one or more others through gonopodial thrusting without her cooperation; 2) if a female mates with more than one male, but the choice of males is in- dependent of the identity of the previous male(s); and 3) if a female chooses second, third, or further males to be different in coloration from previous males. Only the third possibility would result in a stable polymorphism, and it is thus necessary to examine the present data to determine if female choice mechanisms can maintain a male color polymorphism.</page><page sequence="45">82 JAMES A. FARR The two strains in the 10-pair populations with five males of each strain were designated strong and weak, dependent on relative mating success. The strong strain was probably preferred by females, as is seen in the relative number of females inseminated by these males. Insemina- tions achieved by gonopodial thrusting by a preferred strain are not likely to be detected, because females would have more likely already mated with a strong strain than with the weak strain. Multiple matings would thus be most evident if females mated with a preferred strain by choice and were then inseminated through gonopodial thrusting by the un- preferred strain. Mixed broods would be expected to be most numerous when a weak strain was common and least numerous when a weak strain was rare. This was not so. The frequency of multiple inseminations was greatest when less preferred strains were rare, and this suggests a choice of rare males in addition to common, more preferred males. The hypothesis that all multiple inseminations are a result of a preferred mating and a gonopodial thrust can be rejected. That multiple matings were most frequent when a less preferred strain was rare also suggests that female choice of a second male depends on the identity of the first male. If a second mating is not by gonopodial thrusting and is independent of the identity of a first male, one would ex- pect the frequency of multiple inseminations to be inversely proportional to the frequency of preferred males in the population. As the frequency of preferred males decreases, the probability that a female must mate with a less preferred male increases, and if a preferred phenotype is very com- mon, the only way to account for a high frequency of matings with a less preferred type is to assume either forced inseminations, which I have already rejected, or a change in female preferences. There was not a total shift in female preferences when a weak strain was rare because females continued to mate almost unanimously with the common strains. Females must have chosen to mate with both types, and the data thus in- dicate that multiple mating follow the pattern: If the first male was phenotype A, the second should be anything but A. The mechanism by which a rare male strain has a mating advantage thus depends on the relative attractiveness of that strain to females. If a rare male is a more preferred type, he achieves a reproductive success greater than the frequency of occurrence of his phenotype simply because he is a better male. If a less preferred type is rare, females mate just as often with the preferred types as when .the two types occur in equal pro- portions, and the rare male advantage is achieved by multiple matings by</page><page sequence="46">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 83 the females. There appears not to be a tendency to mate only with a rare male if that male is a less preferred type. It is difficult to determine the mechanism by which so many mixed broods occurred in the populations with five different strains. First, it must be mentioned that the probability of a multiple insemination being expressed as a mixed brood is greater in these populations simply because there were more different types of males available. The fact that the mating success of each strain was proportional to its relative frequency of courtship display activity indicates that female choice and not gonopodial thrusting accounted for most inseminations; multiple inseminations prob- ably resulted from female choice of more than one male. It is impossible to determine whether the choice of second or third males was indepen- dent of the identity of the first male. To understand why female choice mechanisms resulting in a rare male advantage and male polymorphism have evolved in guppies, it is useful to compare them to other, closely related species. There are four species in the genus Poecilia, subgenus Lebistes, about which something is known concerning habitat, color characteristics, and behavior patterns. Three species, P. picta, P. parae, and P. branneri, live in restricted brackish water habitats (ROSEN &amp; BAILEY, 1963; LILEY, 1966, JACOBS, 1969, MAYER, 1948), while P. reticulata occupies a wide variety of habitat types (HASKINS et al., 1961; SEGHERS, 1973; LILEY &amp; SEGHERS, 1975). All have brightly colored males and dull females. In P. picta and P. branneri, males are essentially monomorphic, and in P. parae, there are three different male types (ROSEN &amp; BAILEY, 1963; LILEY, 1966). P. reticulata has a much less elaborate courtship display than the other three species (MAYER, 1948; ROSEN &amp; BAILEY, 1963; LILEY, 1966). I suggest the following hypothesis to explain interspecific differences. P. picta, P. parae, and P. branneri occupy relatively narrow niches with respect to preferred habitat. Females should prefer males which are best able to exploit a restricted environment. I assume that a hypothetical ancestral form exhibited neither a courtship display nor sexual dichromatism, and that both evolved subsequently in response to advan- tages gained by females from mating with healthy, vigorous males which best exploited a specialized (for poeciliids) and less changing en- vironmental type. In a sexually monochromatic species, general ap- pearance, including robustness of body coloration, should signify health and well-being, and females which avoid pale or faintly colored males in a population should produce healthier, better-adapted offspring. Selec- tion would favor preferences for brighter males. Once a preference is</page><page sequence="47">84 JAMES A. FARR established, males should exploit the preference by evolving secondary sexual coloration which makes them seem fitter, whether they are or not. This is the "runaway process of sexual selection" described by FISHER (1930), and it should result in extreme sexual dichromatism. I hypothesize further that males should subsequently evolve behavioral mechanisms which render their coloration more visible to females, and thus courtship displays should replace gonopodial thrusting as the primary mechanism resulting in insemination. As described above, selec- tion would then tend to increase display rate (and display complexity). Ultimately, one would find sexually dichromatic species exhibiting high rates of courtship display, and females should prefer bright coloration and high sexual vigor as indicators of ability to compete in the particular ecological niche. A result of such a system in which females exert preferences for a reduced proportion of males in a population is a reduction in effective population size and subsequent loss of genetic variability through in- breeding (CROW &amp; KIMURA, 1970). SIMANEK (1978) demonstratead this in the sailfin mollie, Poecilia latipinna; the lower was the ratio of dominant: subordinate males in a population, the lower was the observed genetic variability as measured by isozyme polymorphism and average heterozygosity. Several theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that increased heterozygosity is an advantage in tolerating environments which can change dramatically within the lifetime of an in- dividual or within a few generations (LERNER, 1954; LEWONTIN, 1956, 1958; BRYANT, 1974; JOHNSON, 1974, 1976; ZOUROS, 1976; BRUCKNER, 1975, 1976a, 1976b, 1976c, 1978; TEMPLETON &amp; ROTHMAN, 1974, 1978a, 1978b; SOULE, 1979), and one would expect that loss of genetic variability would be disadvantageous in species which inhabit fluctuating en- vironments, particularly if population sizes are small. Species which in- habit highly variable environments should exhibit mating systems which minimize the effects of inbreeding and maximize the probability of pro- ducing heterozygous offspring. The mechanism of female choice in guppies appears to be such an adaptation for maximizing outbreeding. Obviously, to produce offspring with maximal heterozygosity and greater ability to respond to a variable environment, a female should mate with males carrying genes different from her own. It is highly improbable that a female can assess the identity of her own genes, so a pure system of disassortative mating is unlikely. However, there are two possible behavioral mechanisms which can great- ly increase the probability of producing genetically variable offspring.</page><page sequence="48">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 85 First, a male with a rare or new color pattern is less likely to share a female's genes than is one with a common pattern, so preference for such males would be more likely to produce better adapted offspring. LACY (1979) has discussed the rare male advantage with regard to maintaining high levels of heterozygosity. Second, a female can mate with several different males. Even if one male is a close relative, the probability that two or more males, each with a different color pattern, share a high pro- portion of a female's genes is low. I conclude, then, that coloration in guppies is a phenotypic cue by which females can evaluate the likelihood of producing maximally heterozygous offspring. Coloration serves not as an indicator of male superiority, but as a label for a set of male genes. By altering their criteria for choosing males, female guppies have successful- ly facilitated the reinvasion of variable habitats by a more specialized species. O'DONALD (1977b, 1978b) argued that mating with rare types is maladaptive. I agree that many mutations resulting in extreme or dif- ferent phenotypes are maladaptive, and that mating with such types would not produce the most competitive offspring. However, there should be no inherent disadvantage to mating with a male possessing a different but equally conspicuous color pattern. It is only important that a female be able to assess the viability of a male before she mates with him, and female choice should depend not only on frequency of color pat- tern, but also on a criterion of male viability. An inferior rare type should not be favored as much as a vigorous rare type. This could possibly ac- count for the observed patterns of multiple mating and rare male effects in the above experiments. If rare males are more vigorous than common males or at least equal, there should be no question about which should be chosen. If a rare male is obviously inferior, he should either be avoid- ed or mated with in addition to the more vigorous, common types. In a polymorphic population, females should mate with more than one male type, but the determination of which males to mate with should also rest on a quality other than coloration. Courtship display rate probably serves this function, and female choice of males is thus influenced by the sexual vigor of a male (indicating his relative ability to exploit the environment) and by his coloration, an indicator of the likelihood of sharing his genes. In summary, this study demonstrates that the question "What deter- mines reproductive success?" is not a simple one, and that no single fac- tor is a sufficient answer. The most important behavioral factor is the relative rate at which males court females. This is a sexually selected trait and serves as an indicator of overall vigor and competitive ability. A sec- ond influential behavioral factor is the ability of males to inseminate</page><page sequence="49">86 JAMES A. FARR females without their cooperation and thereby to reduce the number of offspring sired by competitor males. The final factor influencing male reproductive success examined in this study is coloration. Male color pat- tern brightness may serve its original function as an indicator of superiority, but only when competitor males exhibit equal sexual vigor. More important is the relative frequency of a color pattern in a popula- tion and the fact that a male merely looks different from his competitors. Females which mate with several different males or with rare males have a higher chance of producing heterozygous offspring more able to tolerate a variable environment, and sexual selection has thus resulted in maintenance of male color polymorphism as a response to environmental instability and unpredictability. SUMMARY The reproductive success of competing male guppies, Poecilia reticulata, was measured and compared to various features of social behavior and secondary sexual coloration. The most important determinant of reproductive success was the rate at which a male courted females relative to those of other males. Males with higher display rates have a greater chance of encountering a receptive female and are preferred by females. Males ad- just their display rate in such a way as to be just noticeably more active than a competitor, and inbred strains differ in the maximum rate at which males can court females. No other factor is able to offset the disadvantage of displaying at a relatively low rate. Sexual selec- tion has resulted in the maximization of courtship activity in natural populations. If males court females with equal frequencies, those which also inseminate females through gonopodial thrusting without female cooperation have a selective advantage. Because poeciliid females store sperm, inseminations through gonopodial thrusting can reduce the reproductive success of competitor males which copulate only following a display. A mixed strategy of displaying and gonopodial thrusting is more successful than either pure strategy. The result is a mating system which partially ignores female choice mechanisms. Intermale aggresssion was found to be maladaptive. Males which displayed at higher rates than competitors were less successful if they were also more aggressive than the com- petitors, than when they were non-aggressive or the competitors were more aggressive. Males were not able to reduce a competitor's courtship display rate through aggression. It was hypothesized that the low level of aggression in natural guppy populations is attributable to the fact that variance in size of males is low and fights would be lengthy before a winner could be determined. This would subtract from time available for court- ship, and female preference for high-displaying males would select against aggressive phenotypes. There was little evidence that conspicuousness of male coloration influences female choice of males. Dull males with high courtship display rates were significantly more suc- cessful than conspicuous males with low display rates. It was concluded that females prefer conspicuous males only if all males exhibit equal courtship display rates. The frequency of male color patterns in a population did affect reproductive success. Males with rare color patterns sired more offspring than expected given their frequency. The mechanism by which a rare male effect was achieved depended on the relative mating success of phenotypes in control populations (all phenotypes occurring with equal fre- quency). If a normally preferred phenotype was rare, females continued to prefer that phenotype over the common phenotype. If a normally unpreferred phenotype was rare,</page><page sequence="50">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 87 females mated with that phenotype in addition to the preferred phenotype, and the rare male effect was thus achieved by multiple inseminations. Females also tended to mate with more than one male in polymorphic populations, and it was concluded that certain female choice patterns with frequent multiple inseminations can maintain a polymor- phism in addition to a pure rare male effect. It was hypothesized that courtship displays and conspicuous male coloration are sexual- ly selected characters which evolved in response to the occupation of invariable habitats or specialized ecological niches by a sexually monomorphic ancestor with only gonopodial thrusting as a means of inseminating females. A subsequent reinvasion of variable habitats resulted in female choice mechanisms which maximize the level of heterozygosity of their offspring, thus resulting in polymorphic populations. The coloration of male gup- pies is a phenotypic cue which influences female choice in such a manner that they mate with those males with whom they most probably have the fewest genes in common.

ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Der Fortpflanzungserfolg von konkurrierenden Guppy-Mannchen, Poecilia reticulata, wurde gemessen und mit verschiedenen Merkmalen des Sozialverhaltens und des Sexual- farbmusters verglichen. Es bestand die gr6fite Abhangigkeit des Fortpflanzungserfolges von der Haufigkeit, mit der ein Mannchen im Vergleich zu anderen Miinnchen die Weibchen anbalzte. Haufiger balzende Miinnchen haben eine gro1fere Chance, kopulationsbereiten Weibchen zu be- gegnen, und werden von den Weibchen bevorzugt. Mannchen andern ihre Balzrate so, daf sie sichtbar aktiver als ihre Konkurrenten sind, wobei unterschiedliche Inzuchtstam- me verschiedene Maximalbalzraten zeigen. Kein anderer Faktor kann den Nachteil einer niedrigen Balzhaufigkeit ausgleichen. Die sexuelle Selektion hat die Balzaktivitat in Freiland-Populationen maximiert.</page><page sequence="54">BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AS DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS 91 Balzen Mannchen mit derselben Haiufigkeit, dann haben diejenigen, die auch durch das sogenannte GonopodialstofNen Weibchen ohne deren Mitwirkung besamen, einen selektiven Vorteil. Da Poeciliiden-Weibchen Sperma speichern, konnen Besamungen durch Gonopodialst6fie den Fortpflanzungserfolg solcher Konkurrenten verringern, die nur nach Balzbewegungen kopulieren. Eine gemischte Strategie von Balzen und Gonopodialstofien ist erfolgreicher als die beiden reinen Strategien. Das Endergebnis ist ein Paarungssystem, das weibliche Wahlmechanismen teilweise ignoriert. Aggression unter Mannchen war nachteilig fir den Paarungserfolg. Mannchen, die haufiger als ihre Konkurrenten balzten, waren weniger erfolgreich, wenn sie gleichzeitig auch aggressiver als ihre Konkurrenten waren, als wenn sie nicht-aggressiv waren oder aber ihre Konkurrenten aggressiver waren. Mannchen konnten die Balzrate eines Kon- kurrenten nicht durch Aggression verringern. Es wurde daher die Hypothese entwickelt, daf Guppy-Mannchen im Freiland nur schwach-aggressiv sind, weil die Gr6fie der Mannchen innerhalb einer Population wenig variabel ist, und Mainnchen lange kaimpfen miussen, bevor der Gewinner feststeht. Die Zeitdauer solcher Kampfe maiite von der Zeit abgezogen werden, die sonst fur das Balzen zur Verfiugung stiinde, und die weibliche Pra- ferenz fur haufig balzeride Mainnchen wurde die Selektion gegen aggressivere Phanoty- pen begunstigen. Es gab wenig Hinweise, dafI die Farbenpracht der Mannchen die weibliche Wahl beeinfluft. Farbschwache Mannchen mit hohen Balzraten waren erfolgreicher als farb- prachtige Mannchen mit niedrigen Balzraten. Daraus wurde gefolgert, daft Weibchen farbenprachtige Mannchen nur dann bevorzugen, wenn alle Mainnchen dieselbe Balzrate zeigen. Die Haufigkeit mannlicher Farbmuster in einer Population bestimmte entscheidend den minnlichen Fortpflanzungserfolg. Mannchen mit seltenen Farbmustern zeugten mehr Nachkommen als man nach ihrer relativen Haufigkeit in der Population erwarten konnte. Der Mechanismus, durch welchen der "rare male effect" (Bevorzugung seltener mannlicher Phanotypen durch die Weibchen) erreicht wurde, hing davon ab, wie erfolg- reich die seltenen Phanotypen in Kontrollpopulationen (gleiche Anzahl mainnlicher Phai- notypen) waren. War ein normalerweise bevorzugter Phanotyp selten, waihlten die Weib- chen weiterhin den normalerweise bevorzugten Phiinotyp anstelle des hiiufigen Phaino- typs. War ein normalerweise nicht bevorzugter Phainotyp selten, kopulierten die Weib- chen sowohl mit dem seltenen Phainotyp als auch mit dem bevorzugten Phanotyp, d.h. der "rare male effect" wurde durch vielfache Besamungen verursacht. Weibchen zeigten auch die Tendenz, in polymorphen Populationen mit mehreren Miinnchentypen zu ko- pulieren, woraus erschlossen wurde, daf manche Wahlmuster der Weibchen einen Poly- morphismus der Mainnchen verursachen konnen, zusatzlich zu einem reinen "rare male effect". Es wurde die Hypothese entwickelt, da1 Balzbewegungen und auffallige mainnliche Farbmuster durch sexuelle Selektion enstanden sind, und zwar als Folge einer Evolutions- reaktion auf die Besiedlung invariabler Habitate oder enger 6kologisher Nichen durch einen sexuell monomorphen Vorfahren, der nur mit Gonopodialst6fien die Weibchen besamte. Eine darauf folgende Wiederbesiedlung von variablen Habitaten fiihrte zu weiblichen Wahlmechanismen, die ein Maximum des Heterozygotiegrads unter den Nachkommen verursacht, wodurch polymorphe Populationen entstanden. Das mannli- che Farbmuster ist somit ein phainotypisches Merkmal, welches die Wahl der Guppy- Weibchen so beeinfluft, daB sie mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit diejenigen Mannchen wah- len, mit denen sie die wenigsten Gene gemeinsam haben.</page></plain_text>
