KNIGHT T HE treatment of demand is the branch of economic theory in which methodological problems are most important and most difficult. This is because it is here that behavior facts are most inseparably bound up with motivation and that objective data call most imperatively for interpretation by subjective facts and meanings.' The objective in this paper is largely negative -to criticize certain recent innovations in the treatment of demand which have been generally hailed as representing an advance but which, in the writer's opin- ion, constitute a movement in a back- ward direction. The particular reference is to the treatment of demand and utility by J. R. Hicks, pioneered by E. Slutzky, I In the pure theory, or ultimate analysis, of eco- nomic behavior, production is for consumption and does not involve any motivation other than that which is derived or imputed from the consumer in- terest. Production and consumption should be de- fined in such a way as to make this distinction clear. Immediate preferences between productive activ- ities will then be treated as situations in which a certain amount of consumption is simultaneous with production, and the two are inseparable. And saving -net production of capital-will be viewed in the usual (only partly realistic) way as provision for fu- ture consumption. The sweeping limitation of such assumptions, in contrast with the inclusive facts of motivation, can be given only incidental notice in this paper. and also followed, and more or less inde- pendently worked out, by Henry Schultz and many others.2 The essential fea- tures of the theory are a new psychology of consumption and a distinctive treat- ment of the demand curve based upon the former. The new interpretation of consumption is more relativistic than the conventional view, specifically that of Marshall, and is adopted for the sake of greater objectivity. It has two aspects. The first is replacement of the concep- tion of "absolute" diminishing incre- mental utility (of a single good) with a diminishing "coefficient of substitu- tion" of one good for another, assumed to be a purely behavioristic principle, or at least purely relative. The second as- pect is a distinctive view of the relation between change in income and change in the psychic state of the subject-his eco- nomic well-being. In this second connec- tion the thinkers criticized have not been willing to follow through with a behavior- istic complete rejection of subjective 2 Hicks, Value and Capital (Oxford, I939), chap. i; Schultz, The Theory and Measurement of Demand (Chicago, I938); see also the contributions of Mo- sak and Samuelson to Studies in Mathematical Eco- nomics and Econometrics, in Memory of Henry Schultz, edited by 0.

KNIGHT magnitudes-or their reduction to the role of a "force" impelling men to buy and consume and to compare and choose. They still think of the individual as con- trolling his consumption with a view to securing more rather than less of some- thing called "utility"-a subjective mag- nitude which is maximized when the consumer's behavior conforms to the economic ideal. They merely insist that this something-maximized need not, and therefore should not, be treated as a quantity in the ordinary "cardinal" meaning, but as only "ordinal," that is, utilities are subject to ranking but not to real quantification, which is identified with measurement.3 3 In the course of this discussion we shall distin- guish sharply between quantification and measure- ment, stressing quantification by estimation with- out measurement, and will use the terms "quantity" and "ordinal magnitude" to designate the two main concepts which are to be contrasted. This article will not be encumbered with refer- ences to the literature-even that which is known to the writer and which, in view of his mathematical limitations, he feels competent to judge. This applies especially to recent work (including articles by Hicks) based on the assumption of absolute money prices and relative utility, which it is the main pur- pose of the article to criticize. Earlier references may be found in the books of Schultz and Hicks cited above in n. 2. The aim here is to clarify issues and state a position in nonmathematical and the simplest possible terms. To venture into detailed criticism of the history of doctrine would both extend the paper far beyond allowable compass and make its perusal laborious and confusing. The writer may note, how- ever, that he was first jolted out of complacency and led to rethink the problem by reading a short article by Oscar Lange, "The Determinateness of the Util- ity Function," Review of Economic Studies, I (I934), 2I8-25. Also that in the discussion which followed the publication of this article and of articles by Schultz and Hicks and Allen in I934 and I935, and their independent rediscovery of Slutzky's paper of I915, Harro Bernardelli stands out as a thinker, and particularly one of mathematical competence, who has "kept his feet on the ground" and not been swept away by the romantic glamour of revolution and the temptation to indulge in logical ingenuity presented by the "new" form of analysis. Cf. "Notes on the Determinateness of the Utility Function," Review of Economic Studies, II (I934-35), 69-77. It goes without saying that we recognize the high In the way of construction we shall at- tempt to clarify the relationship between the subjective and the objective aspects of the economic values of different con- sumption goods-more accurately, serv- ices-under given conditions correctly defined and the relation between levels of objective consumption, or real income, and economic well-being. On the basis of this analysis we shall outline a realistic theory of the demand curve. Part IV of the paper will take up the problem of measurement in connection with eco- nomic well-being and motivation; Part V will offer a brief re-examination of the problem of consumer's surplus. In the first three parts, it will be assumed that the reader has a general knowledge of re- cent controversial discussion, and our treatment will be confined to a brief statement of essentials, without elabora- tion in detail. I. THE THEORY OF INDIFFERENCE- VARIOUS METHODS OF EXPOSITION For a clear, sound, and useful theory of demand, or the demand curve, the first essential is a sharp separation be- tween the comparative economic values of different goods in relation to a given level of "economic well-being" of the in- dividual consumer and a theory of the relation between changes in the level of well-being and changes in consumption. In the absence of any better terminology, we may refer to the first as the "theory of comparative value" (relative in the sense of comparing different goods) and to the second as the "theory of dynamic valua- intellectual quality of the work which has gone into the development of the "new approach" and its value in contributing to the clarification of the issues, and also that choice between fundamental assumptions is, to some extent, a matter of taste and may depend on the purpose in view in a particular exposition.</page><page sequence="3">REALISM AND RELEVANCE IN THE THEORY OF DEMAND 29I tion." It is to be understood that the term "value" is used in the strictly eco- nomic sense, without any implication of "objectivity," as in ethics or aesthetics, where valuations may be "right" or "wrong" or be affected with a quality of imperative or "oughtness." As in all eco- nomic discussion, we take the consum- er's individual evaluations as final. We also exclude the factor of "error" in its more intellectual meanings; we assume that what the consumer wants is what he gets, and describe his behavior under the condition that he "correctly" solves his "economic" problem, actually max- imizing whatever it is that he tries to maximize in the choices which direct his behavior as a consumer. We first consider different methods of graphing in the simple case of a two- commodity system. In order to make the most useful approximation to the condi- tions of real life, we assume that an indi- vidual A is given a total income (over a short interval of time dt) in the form of a definite amount y, of commodity Y, measured along a vertical axis and that he is confronted with the opportunity of exchanging successive increments of Y for increments of another commodity, X, measured along a horizontal axis (see Fig. i). The conditions are such that A "buys" successive infinitesimal incre- ments of X, seriatim, paying for the first the maximum amount of Y which he is willing to pay, for the second the maximum amount he is willing to pay after having bought the first, and so on. Thus we picture the "generation" of a curve ICI, the simplest form of indiffer- ence curve; for the purpose of distinction we shall call it the "indifference-com- binations" curve. The ordinate on this curve at any point on the X-axis meas- ures the amount of Y which A will have left out of his original supply (per unit of time) after carrying the process to any point, while the abscissa of the same point measures the amount of X he will have secured. (The total amount of Y given up is measured downward from y.) Every point on the curve represents a different combination of amounts of X and Y such that to the given subject A (with initial income y) exchange or choice between any two combinations is a matter of indifference. The ratio or price at which the last exchange is made (or the next one will be made) is meas- ured by the slope of the curve at any Y By flU a \ ~~X FIG. I point-with a negative sign, if, as is usual, we think of the price of X in terms of Y, the price of the good secured in terms of that given up. If we continue such a curve to the right over a sufficient interval, it will take the general form shown in Figure i. The facts here are not in dispute, especially as far as the descending section of the curve is concerned. The curve will de- scend over some interval, with a de- creasing (negative) slope, to a point at which it becomes horizontal; and then, if the experiment is continued, it will ascend at an increasing (positive) slope. The lowest point S on the curve (the point at which it is horizontal) corre- sponds to complete satiety with good X; the price of X here is zero, and no fur- ther amount of Y will be voluntarily</page><page sequence="4">292 FRANK H. KNIGHT given up for any further amount of X. Under the conditions of a two-commod- ity system, this point should ordinarily have the same X value, regardless of the subject's initial income, if X and Y are "independent," i.e., noncomplementary but different goods. Along the ascending leg of the curve the increasing slope shows that it would be necessary to give back to A increasing amounts of Y, previously given up, to "hire" him to consume each successive increment of X. (We assume consump- tion, compulsory if necessary, ignoring the possibility that later increments of X might be simply ignored or might be disposed of in some other way.) Over the interval between S and y correspond- ing to the initial supply of Y, the curve will have dual Y values; there will be two equivalent combinations of each quan- tity of Y with different quantities of X, one corresponding to a deficiency, the other to a superfluity, of X. The ascend- ing part of the curve is unrealistic under ordinary conditions where the subject has freedom of choice; but the hypo- thetical procedure is useful for depicting the psychology of demand. The curve ICI may be extended upward beyond y, giving A more Y than his initial income, to a point at which it would become ver- tical, indicating that no more of X could be consumed without making him abso- lutely worse off (or more than would be voluntarily consumed) no matter how much Y were given him at the same time. The facts shown by the indifference curve may also be presented by a curve drawn upward initially and then down- ward (curve IC2 in Fig. I). This has some advantages, particularly that the amounts of Y given up are indicated in positive instead of negative terms in the significant part. But points on the curves will not then represent "indifference combinations" of X and Y, on the same axes. Exactly the same facts may again be portrayed by a curve of relative incre- mental (marginal) utility, as shown in curve RU, which may be called a "curve of indifference-prices" or a "price-indif- ference curve." On this second curve the vertical axis is a scale of exchange ratios or prices (Y/X or Y per unit of X, at the margin, i.e., dY/dX, in the previous no- tation); that is, the price at any point is measured by the ordinate instead of by the slope. Hence the ordinate of RU measures the slope of curves ICI and IC2 at any point on X, or it is the "deriva- tive" of either of these except for alge- braic sign in case of the former. Curves IC1 and IC2 may be viewed as curves of total expenditure drawn under the con- dition that a consumer buys from a monopolist who exacts the maximum total amount (or maximum price per unit) the buyer is willing to pay for each amount of X. The radical difference be- tween RU, the derivative curve, and a demand curve, showing amounts pur- chased at given prices with the buyer free to choose the amount he will take at each price, will come into consideration repeatedly as the argument proceeds. Curve RU will intersect the X-axis at the point at which the indifference curve as previously drawn (in either form) be- comes horizontal, and beyond that point the indifference-price will become in- creasingly negative. The hypothesis of a two-commodity system is, of course, unrealistic and should be used with great caution. De- tails of the curves would depend on nec- essarily arbitrary assumptions as to the character of the two goods and the rela- tions between them. To make the dis- cussion more realistic, we should first take the vertical axis as a scale in terms</page><page sequence="5">REALISM AND RELEVANCE IN THE THEORY OF DEMAND 293 of "money" representing a complex of alternative commodities, at prices which vary together, but inversely with the price of X, so that the money has con- stant total purchasing-power. This change in the facts represented will not change the general form of any of our curves. This is still true if any of the com- modities in the complex Y are interre- lated among themselves or with X by any degree of complementarity or sim- ilarity. And it is immaterial for the gen- eral argument just what price changes occur within the alternative complex, among the infinitude of possibilities, to offset the changing price of X and keep the value of money constant. The indif- ference-combinations-curve method of graphing (for X and money) has a great advantage over the indifference-price method, in that the former shows money income directly on a plane diagram and so makes it possible to represent a whole "system" of curves, corresponding to dif- ferent levels of income. But its use is limited because it does not correspond with market quotations and everyday ways of thinking, which necessarily run in terms of price and quantity.4 4 We more commonly meet with the indifference- combinations curve for two goods as generated by changes in opposite directions from an intermediate starting-point, as roughly suggested in the accom- panying figure. Only a part of the negatively in- clined portion of the curve is usually drawn, the con- tinuous line in the figure. If the curve is projected in realistic form in both directions, it will have the general shape indicated by the dotted portions. De- tails would largely depend on the goods in question, their absolute and relative importance, relations of complementarity and substitution, etc. Single com- II. CONSUMER S VALUATION AS A ''DYNAMIC ' PROBLEM We turn to the psychological problem of the interpretive explanation of the curves considered in Part I or of the facts which they represent. The curves are taken as portraying objective facts of consumer behavior (though under ideal- ized conditions), with only incidental reference to any subjective state as "in- difference." But it is necessary to decide whether they are to be allowed to stand as purely empirical or are to bring the behavior facts into some intelligible rela- tion to facts of subjective experience.5 The second position is the one to be de- fended in this paper as a whole. The more philosophical aspect of the argu- ment for considering motives, and not merely the facts of choice, will be de- veloped in Part IV. In the present sec- tion we shall merely explore certain psy- chological relations. Further than this, we need only remark here that such terms as "willingly" and "voluntarily" occur in the earlier exposition and sug- gest that it would not be easy to elimi- nate them and make the discussion seem to "talk sense." The main concrete issue directly raised is whether we should think of the "utility" of a single good-the property which causes it to be consumed and modities that are actually "necessary" hardly occur, and this and other special cases need not be consid- ered. In both directions the curve will ordinarily be- come parallel, first, with the neighboring axis and then with the other axis. This second event might occur before reaching a point of intersection with the other branch, preventing completion of the closed figure shown. In any event the situation rep- resented by the parts of the curve beyond zero mar- ginal utility for either commodity is unrealistic and need not be discussed. 5 The former procedure was followed by Cournot in a pure-theory treatment and is the point of view of statistical investigators of demand.</page><page sequence="6">294 FRANK H. KNIGHT chosen for consumption in preference to other goods-as an independent varia- ble, or as inherently and solely a compari- son between the particular good and other goods. In other words, should we view the essence of (final) economic val- ue as purely a comparison or think of relative value as a comparison between the values of different goods? Investiga- tion of the question will take the form of an inquiry into the dynamic problem of the quantitative relation between uncom- pensated variation in the consumption of individual goods or combinations of goods and variations in desirable experi- ence or state of being in the consumer, i.e., in his "mind." In terms of the estab- lished principles used in the analysis of demand, prior to this new controversy, the issue will be found to center in the principle of diminishing utility in connec- tion with an individual good. As pointed out earlier, the Slutzky school deny this principle; they replace it by a combina- tion of two devices, the principle of a decreasing ratio of substitution of one good for another-at a constant level of well-being expressed through "free" choice-and a ranking without "meas- urement" (or quantification) of states of total well-being, as an individual passes from one indifference level to another. Our first step will be to inquire into the reality of the principle of diminishing utility for a single good. The investiga- tion may take the form of reflecting upon a series of simple imaginary experiments. To make the analysis accurate and the conditions realistic, in contrast with the vague and misleading assumptions usu- ally met with, we must begin by care- fully stating the ceteris paribws condi- tions. We postulate an individual who is consuming a "reasonable" list or budget of commodities, not including the one involved in the experiments, and who continues throughout to consume these in unvarying amount. The first experi- ment consists in adding to the individ- ual's consumption of these items succes- sive equal small (infinitesimal) incre- ments (per unit of time) of the particu- lar commodity or good X, not before consumed, and having him report upon his experience of "satisfaction." These conditions allow full play for all rela- tions of complementarity and similarity ("substitutability") among all the com- modities, including the one which is varied in the experiment. In the interest of precision and clarity, other conditions of the experiment need to be carefully stated and some terms defined. We must sharply separate con- sumer behavior from all productive ac- tivity, and especially from saving and investment, and must be clear about the dimensionality of the magnitudes with which we are dealing. To touch first on the second point, consumption (like pro- duction and all "activity") has the di- mensionality of a flow or "flux." But the correct physical analogy is not the flow of a material such as water, which exists and can be measured when it is not flow- ing. Light is perhaps the best physical analogue in this respect. The rate of flow of water is realistically viewed as a composite magnitude-quantity divided by time. With light the relation is the opposite. Only the intensity can be meas- ured directly (though the unit may be defined in terms of other dimensions); quantity is the composite and derivative magnitude, an arithmetical product of in- tensity times time-candle-power-hours. It is a mere concept, essentially ficti- tious. The same relation holds for consump- tion, whether thought of as a subjective or as an objective magnitude. What is consumed is always a service (of some</page><page sequence="7">REALISM AND RELEVANCE IN THE THEORY OF DEMAND 295 agent, human or "physical"). The re- sult, which is the end or purpose and which gives consumption quantitative meaning, may be called "want-satisfac- tion," or simply "satisfaction"; but "subjective service" is a less objection- able designation. Any more concrete definition will commit the economist on psychological or moral issues with which he has nothing to do. It is simply the common quality underlying all direct economic comparison and choice-"that which" the consumer strives to maxi- mize and does maximize when his be- havior is "economic." It must be a homogeneous magnitude if we are to speak of quantitative change; and, since there is no physical attribute which is common to all sources of satisfaction, the end of consumption must be a single variable state or condition of the indi- vidual. We assume that what is desired is identical with what is realized and ex- perienced; that is, we abstract from error connected with the fact that consump- tion may be treated as a means to welfare as the real end-and from the fact that novelty, surprise, and gratification of curiosity are elements in real enjoyment and in the motivation of choice. This as- sumption is largely implied by ideal sta- tionary conditions, in which desire and satisfaction, production and consump- tion, are strictly simultaneous. ("Util- ity" is the attribute of an agent by virtue of which it yields subjective service, and the two terms are not always inter- changeable.) Correspondingly, the pri- mary meaning of production is "objec- tive service" or the use of any agent to render subjective service. The main source of confusion in rela- tion to consumption is the fact that pro- duction in this primary meaning is not necessarily equal to consumption over any interval of time. Production may ex- ceed consumption, the difference being (axiomatically) added to "capital"; i.e., it may consist in the production of (addi- tional) capital and not of "satisfaction." And, conversely, consumption may ex- ceed production, the difference repre- senting a decrease of capital. (Produc- tion of what is consumed includes main- tenance of capital.) Since the production of any amount of capital (saving and in- vestment) represents the sacrifice of a given amount of consumption and re- sults in future consumption, it seems natural to think of a quantity of capital as a quantity of consumption stored up in a stock. But this is invalid, for two reasons. The quantity of capital accum- ulated in any finite interval is not the amount of consumption sacrificed-in- tensity times time-but contains an ad- ditional element, a return on investment, continuously compounded at a certain "rate." (This is usually referred to as the rate of interest, but it has no connection with the lending of money-or of any- thing else-and would have exactly the same meaning in a Crusoe economy as in a pecuniary society.) On the other hand, a quantity of capital does not represent any determinate quantity of future con- sumption. Until and unless the capital itself is consumed, the total yield grows without limit; and in any case it also is affected by the rate of return or interest. Analysis requires treatment of the pro- duction of capital during any interval and its subsequent use to yield consump- tion-service (or further investment) as distinct acts or processes of production.6 6 It should go without saying that the "produc- tion of capital" means here "net production" or "growth," distinguished from the maintenance of capital already existing, including all replacements, even by a different type of concrete agent (and that "capital" consumption means "net" consumption). In real life the bulk of investment is "presumptively permanent"; only the yield is expected to be con-</page><page sequence="8">296 FRANK H. KNIGHT Elimination of all investment and dis- investment in effect reduces exchange to the purchase and sale of services, with- out any transfer of "goods" (all of which are "capital"), and imposes stationary conditions. It also eliminates all lending of money; for, under ideal conditions, such a loan is indistinguishable from a lease for a rental. Similarly excluded are all "contracts" for the purchase and sale of services, involving any commitment for the future. It is most convenient to think of the consumer as not owning any productive capacity, and particularly any money.' Returning to our imaginary experi- ment, we are to think of our subject as having no alternatives of choice; he is simply given increasing amounts (per time unit) of a particular objective serv- ice, which we shall now call osi. We sub- mit that beyond any possibility of doubt he will report decreasing incre- ments in the intensity of subjective serv- ice ssi from equal increments of osi (added to his original budget). That is, the variation in his additional satisfac- tion will show progressive satiation up to a point of complete satiety, and then run sued, or not all of that, apart from some emergency -but, of course, there are important exceptions. We cannot go into the special difficulties of investment in human beings or their capacities (and its mainte- nance) in "free" society, beyond noting that in es- sential respects these are much like any other capi- tal. This fact and its practical limitation will be evi- dent if one compares conditions in a slave economy with those of free individualism (see also n. 7 be- low). 7 This assumption again raises the difficulty of the individual's ownership and use of himself as a pro- ductive agent. It is really necessary to assume only that all ownership, of things or capacities or money, is held constant. Consumption must be separated from such changes, particularly in the holding of money, in order to isolate the special problems con- nected with that cause. One important desideratum in economic analysis is to bring out explicitly the unrealistic assumptions necessary to generality at every point. into supersatiation with increasing in- crements of negative satisfaction. It will be represented by a curve of the shape of a round arch or inverted U (preferably measured upward from a false base line). It is to be stressed that the increments of subjective service are not quantified (on ''measurement" see below) by comparison with any other kind of satisfaction. Each increment of satisfaction is compared only with the increments of the same kind which precede it in the sequence. The total real income of the subject in- creases by equal steps, as defined and measured in physical units by an ideal index number, while, in subjective terms, it behaves in the manner described. Thus the curve and its derivative are very dif- ferent in meaning from IC2 of Figure i. The experiment is, next, to be modified in two steps. First, we give the subject increasing amounts, in fixed proportions, of all the items in any fixed budget or list of services. The resulting variation in total satisfaction will certainly take the same form as before. Next we give him "money" in increasing amounts (in- creasing by equal increments), restricted to the purchase of a given list of items at fixed (absolute) money prices, with freedom to reapportion his expenditure among them at will. The reported result will again be of the same kind-total satisfaction increasing by decreasing steps and then decreasing. If introspection leaves any room for doubt as to the declining (arithmetic) rate of increase, it is proved by the un- questionable fact that if the money in- come of an individual increases, under realistic conditions (i.e., if he has free- dom of choice) he will not merely buy more of the services previously consumed but, in addition to buying more of these, will spend part of his increased income for services not previously consumed.</page><page sequence="9">REALISM AND RELEVANCE IN THE THEORY OF DEMAND 297 This is wholly inexplicable and would not happen, except for the fact that the whole list previously consumed is sub- ject to diminishing incremental utility. Mere growth of total income cannot in- crease the utility of items not previously consumed and cannot increase their rela- tive marginal utility or coefficient of sub- stitution, in comparison with earlier items, unless increased consumption ab- solutely reduces the marginal utility of the earlier budget items. We cannot realistically interpret the decline in the marginal utility of one good increased in supply relative to others not consumed, hence its decreasing coefficient of substi- tution for the latter, without taking into account its decreasing absolute mar- ginal utility as its consumption increases, ceteris Paribus. Further, the negative price elasticity of demand for a good cannot be dissociated from declining positive income elasticity, all prices be- ing constant and with the consumer free to add new items. And decreasing income elasticity can result only from decreasing marginal utility of any whole list of goods or of money to be spent for them at given prices.8 8 There is actually no reasonable ground for doubt that money income of constant objective pur- chasing-power decreases in marginal utility (and utility per unit) as its amount increases, even if ex- penditure is not restricted to the purchase of the same goods. This restriction only makes the conclu- sion more obvious and the decline more rapid than if the individual is free to add new items to his budget. The rate of decline might be reduced by a high de- gree of complementarity between items previously consumed and new items; but the general effect of this will be merely a greater variety in consumption at all income levels. It is a judgment of common sense, on a level of self-evidence virtually that of the simpler mathematical axioms that, other things be- ing equal, the addition or subtraction of a dollar per week or month from his income means less to the re- cipient of a larger income than to one whose income is smaller. Apart from this principle, no one would defend or suggest the justice of progressive income taxation. Equality of sacrifice of "final value" to the subject (however this is interpreted) would then call The propositions (a) that utility and satisfaction are purely relative and (b) that the total is merely an ordinal mag- nitude are impossible even under the as- sumption that demand curves are to be studied exclusively with reference to a given list of commodities. If absolute marginal utility did not decrease, no de- terminate apportionment of income would be made. If we think of the con- sumer's income beginning at zero and gradually increasing, the first increment would be spent on the service yielding the most satisfaction for the initial unit, or one chosen at random. And if increas- ing consumption of this item carried in- creasing or constant incremental satis- faction, no other items would ever be added but all further additions to in- come would be spent for the same good. (With incremental change constant, adding new items would either involve loss or be a matter of indifference.) It is logically admissible to think that the marginal utility of a particular good may increase with increasing consump- tion over a narrow initial interval; and this might even be true of total income, under special conditions. But the ra- tional consumer will never stop using for absolutely equal taxation, not even equality in the fractional levy, to say nothing of progression. (The statement assumes that consumption is the only significance of income, ignoring such factors as security, prestige, power, justice, etc., which may make equality a consideration for other reasons or on its own account.) As far as the present discussion is concerned, we need not dispute the usual assumption that the de- sire for income is insatiable, that its marginal utility would never fall to zero or become negative, if it can be used to satisfy additional wants. However, the proposition is doubtful if wants are strictly defined in terms of consumption, excluding social emulation, prestige, and power. And it is surely false if we go on and exclude special costs of change desired purely for the sake of change. However, this factor bulks large in want-satisfaction even at low income levels and introduces an element of unreality into a mechanical or function-and-variable theory of demand.</page><page sequence="10">298 FRANK H. KNIGHT freely apportionable income to purchase any quantity of a good within an inter- val of increasing marginal utility but will proceed at least to the point of maxi- mum utility per unit of expenditure; and (with proportions freely variable) no budget items will be added in the inter- val of increasing utility of money in- come. The situation is parallel with that of productive services, where the opera- tions are limited to the range of dimin- ishing physical returns. All facts of com- plementarity and similarity are essen- tially the same in the two cases. Subjec- tive service is not physically measurable, but its quantitative variation is factually indubitable; and even if it were possible to explain the facts of demand without it, the procedure would be interesting only as an intellectual "stunt." We must hasten to take account of a realistic difficulty in reasoning from the addition of new items to a budget, with increasing income in money of constant purchasing-power. In this situation an individual will not usually increase his consumption of all previous items but, besides adding new items, will to some extent replace commodities previously consumed with new ones, decreasing his purchase of some of the former, or even dropping them altogether. In a familiar illustration, if he has been eating chiefly bread, at a higher income he may not only add some meat but consume less bread. Moreover, he may also replace a lower "grade" of bread with a higher grade. As we classify commodities more "finely," even to correspond with market facts in a high civilization, displacement of items may predominate over increased consumption. The phenomenon of replacement of "inferior" by "superior" goods or the reverse, as income changes, has re- ceived much attention in recent discus- sion. The correct view is that they are different goods. Even the "same" good bought from a dealer of a different class is really a different thing-certainly, if a different price is paid, whatever the rea- son. The underlying fact is that any commodity, as named and sold in the market, yields a "bundle" of diverse subjective services, which are to be had only (or more economically) in combina- tion rather than separately. Things re- garded as differing only in grade are usually named with reference to some predominant useful quality which they have in common, along with different as- sortments of other qualities. At the most general level of analysis it should be as- sumed that each single good (objective service) as purchased yields a single type of satisfaction. This might still be al- lowed to vary in degree in accord with the price for the ordinary market unit, "quality" differing in that sense. Under this assumption, displacement obviously will not occur in consequence of income change. III. THE MEANING OF A DEMAND CURVE We must now briefly consider the de- mand curve in terms of its expository meaning rather than its psychological or philosophical interpretation. Here we are concerned with an aspect of the Slutzky view which has little logical connection with the methodological conceptions with which we find it associated. The de- mand curve in the tradition of modern economic theory shows the functional re- lation between price and quantity taken (or sold) for a particular good, "all other things being equal." It is always assumed that the buyer confronts a set price at which he is free to purchase as much or as little of the good as he may choose-a fact which differentiates the curve sharp-</page><page sequence="11">REALISM AND RELEVANCE IN THE THEORY OF DEMAND 299 ly from any of those we have previously considered. Until quite recently few, if any, writers were at all careful to say what they meant by this ceteris paribus condition; and in general it probably did not occur to them that price is ambigu- ous or that it is not possible for all other things to be equal. The money price and sale of a particular good cannot change while all other variables in an economic system are constant. We have to choose in analysis between holding the prices of all other goods constant and maintain- ing constant the "real income" of the hypothetical consumer. For, obviously, if the price of a single good, X, increases, while the prices of other goods are un- changed (along with the money income of the individual), the "value of money" to the subject will have decreased-in objective and in subjective terms-and vice versa. The strict ceteris paribus as- sumption can be valid only when there is no finite change, i.e., for the partial de- rivative of a total-consumption function at a single point. The treatment of the Slutzky school adopts the assumption that the price of X varies under the condition that the prices of all other goods (and the con- sumer's money income) are constant. Hence, real income must change. Of the two alternatives, this seems to be defi- nitely the wrong choice. It throws to- gether two distinct effects upon consump- tion, the "price effect" and the "income effect." The treatment then proceeds to separate these by means of an ingenious analysis. The cleverness of it all must be conceded. But it is called for only be- cause of an initial confusion in the state- ment of the problem, which is wholly un- necessary and should clearly be avoided. The simple and obvious alternative is to draw the demand curve in terms of a change in relative prices, i.e., to assume that the value of money is held constant, through compensating changes in the prices of other goods, and not that these other prices are held constant. The "in- come effect" of Slutzky et al. is merely a particular case or mode of change in the purchasing-power of money, or the price level; and it is this problem as a whole that should be isolated and re- served for separate treatment.9 As to reality, important price changes generally approximate one or the other of two patterns. Either the price of a particular good changes, relative to the prices of other goods-reflecting some change in tastes or productive conditions -without a significant change in the general price level, or all prices change more or less simultaneously, in conse- quence of monetary changes. In so far as change is general and uniform, the whole phenomenon is purely arithmetical, par- ticularly since incomes change in the same ratio as the prices of consumption goods. Of course, the two types of change occur together, to some extent; and espe- cially the relative prices of consumption goods and of various indirect goods and productive services (and the present val- ues of contracts and other commitments) are differentially changed over substan- tial periods by changes which originate in the field of money and ultimately lead chiefly to a movement of the general price level. Boom and depression are in- cidents of such temporary changes. Real, practical price problems arise only in connection with changes in relative prices, and it is exclusively the connec- tion of general changes with such rela- tive changes that gives the general price 9 The conception of price changes as relative is, of course, the view which was made classical by the treatment of J. S. Mill and is perhaps the position generally adopted in textbooks-when the authors state their assumptions or make it possible to dis- cern any consistent position.</page><page sequence="12">300 FRANK H. KNIGHT level any practical importance. Conse- quently, the separation of price changes due to monetary causes from those due to other causes is one of the main tasks of price analysis as a whole. An approach to any particular price problem which "jumbles" effects of change in the purchasing-power of money (however caused) with effects of change in its rela- tive value for purchasing different things is mere gratuitous confusion. And it is easy to avoid, specifically in the theory of demand. In fact, this confusing pro- cedure is much more complex and diffi- cult than one based on formulating the problem in more realistic terms to begin with, in the manner already indicated. That is: in drawing the demand curve, the utility and the objective purchasing- power of money are the factors which should be held constant ("impounded in ceteris paribus," in Marshall's familiar phrase) and not the prices of other con- sumption goods. This procedure has the further great advantage of eliminating the spurious "Giffen paradox" (see below) and making the theory of consumption logically parallel with the theory of pro- duction, which is in accord with the es- sential facts.'" IO We may digress to point out that the general point of view and habit of mind reflected in the Hicks-Slutzky analysis has wide ramifications in re- cent literature and has led to utter confusion in the whole body of economic thought. We refer, of course, to the huge corpus of discussion beginning with Keynes's General Theory and following the lead of that work. J. R. Hicks's book, Value and Capital, is especially interesting as a general treatise which combines the theory of Keynes's treatment of unem- ployment and money with the Slutzky analysis of demand and theory of utility. It should be kept in mind that there is no logical connection between the confusion of price changes due to monetary causes and those due to other causes with either the use of indifference curves or their distinctive psychological- philosophical interpretation. This whole episode may be viewed as a reaction against the neglect of monetary changes and their extremely important effects (boom and depression) It is a fairly simple matter to explain the general shape-the descending slope -of the demand curve (of an individual for a particular good) in terms of its (in- dependent) diminishing incremental util- ity in comparison with that of other goods. Quantity purchased decreases as the relative price increases (ceteris pari- bus) because at the higher price the same amount of money buys less of the partic- ular good, while there is a small converse effect on the complex of other goods, which fall in price. Consequently, if the consumer's marginal "dollar" bought equal increments of total satisfaction in terms of all services before the change, it will, after the change, buy less satisfac- tion if spent for the particular service, osi, than if spent for competing services; and enough of osi will be replaced in the individual's budget by other goods to restore the equality. The total expendi- ture upon osi may increase or decrease or remain constant, according as the elasticity of demand (determined by all the factors which enter into the demand in the main line of treatises of classical economic the- ory, including Marshall. Mill and other classical writers paid some incidental attention to monetary or trade crises but strangely neglected the more im- portant and longer-range repercussions upon produc- tion, as well as the converse causal relation between productive maladjustments--especially in the field of investment and price disorganization. Failure to deal somewhere with these phenomena is doubtless a valid criticism of the classical economic theory as a whole. But it does not follow at all that the omission is to be corrected by jumbling other maladjustments, real and pecuniary, in with the general theory of economic equilibrium. The valid remedy for the de- fect represents much less of a departure from tradi- tion. It consists simply in adding what has been lacking, i.e., adding a theory of monetary perturba- tions to the theory of general equilibrium. We need not here enter upon this task, but we may note that, since all the important phenomena could well occur without either commercial banking or any lending of money, the perturbations of the interest rate (or rates) and their causes and effects are a relatively minor topic in the inquiry as a whole.</page><page sequence="13">REALISM AND RELEVANCE IN THE THEORY OF DEMAND 30I situation) is below, above, or equal to unity." IV. SATISFACTION AS A QUANTITY We come to the crucial methodologi- cal, or philosophical, issue in the inter- pretation of economic choice, and specif- ically in the theory of demand. The ques- tion raised by the new school of thought has two forms or aspects. The question is whether "total satisfaction" is a cardinal magnitude, a "quantity," or is merely ordinal. This is the variable which the ''economic man" strives to maximize in his choices as a consumer with a given income and as a producer with given productive resources, and strives to in- crease by increasing his income through I, If we consider the whole range of price varia- tion, the elasticity of demand will normally have a high value at the highest price at which consump- tion begins, and will fall to zero as price declines to some point at which consumption no longer in- creases appreciably with its further decline. Elas- ticity must, of course, be measured at a position of equilibrium. It will ordinarily be low if determined in relation to sudden changes; and the fact that these afford practically the only possibility of de- termining it inductively largely vitiates statistical measurements; for if a change is slow, other things cannot be assumed equal, and we cannot distin- guish empirically between a movement along the curve and a movement of the curve as a whole. The elasticity of demand depends on the availability of substitutes; but freedom of substitution is only in part a matter of physical similarity between goods or even between the types of satisfaction which they yield. It must be emphasized that the demand curve, showing the relation between price and quantity taken, under the condition that the subject is free to buy as much or as little as he pleases of osi at a uni- form price (other things being equal in other re- spects), is a very different thing from any form of in- difference curve. A demand curve cannot be drawn from an indifference curve, nor from a system of in- difference curves in the form in which these usually appear. A curve of the Hicks-Slutzky type can be drawn from an indifference map only if objective money or commodity values are given for the curves; a true demand curve could presumably (in theory) be computed from a complete "map" in n dimen- sions (in algebraic form) and a given income and given pattern of compensating price changes. saving and investment. The question is identical with that as to the reality of the diminishing marginal or incremental utility of a particular good or group of goods, as increasing amounts are con- sumed by an individual, ceteris paribus. The Slutzky analysis of demand, as de- veloped by Hicks and others (after it was suggested by Pareto), sharply separates movement along an indiffer- ence curve (with a fixed real income) from movement from a lower to a higher indifference curve with increasing real income. We assume here that the analy- sis is correctly set up, with the money income of the individual increasing while all prices are constant, and that the in- difference curves start from an axis of money. The "new" analysis admits that the individual moving outward from the origin across his indifference curves is really moving "up hill" along a third perpendicular axis of total satisfaction or well-being, that the indifference curves are projections downward of contour lines on a surface. But it denies the need of assigning any vertical scale of magni- tude to change in this direction. It is held that the upward movement can be represented by an index function, all other properties of which are immaterial except that it is increasing. Since that is all we need to know about it, no other information should be used in analysis.12 This view eliminates diminishing mar- ginal (incremental) utility of increasing total income, in whatever manner the increase is effected, in terms of actual goods. As we have pointed out, recogni- tion of diminishing utility is another way of saying that we can draw a curve of total satisfaction in a vertical plane 12 In the absence of experimental determination of a satisfaction-function we actually work with the supposed essential properties of such functions.</page><page sequence="14">302 FRANK H. KNIGHT through any straight line in the base plane, cutting all the indifference curves, as an X-axis and that it will ascend at a decreasing slope. This decrease in slope is a fact additional to that of ascent and can be present only if a linear scale is assigned to the perpendicular axis. For convenience we consider move- ment along the axis of money, observ- ing that the curves are spaced at equal intervals along that axis (but no- where else) and that money has constant objective purchasing-power. For the purpose of the moment this may be given the simplest meaning-constancy of all prices. For convenience we may take this Y-axis or money axis as a new X-axis and treat the vertical third axis as a Y-axis and ask what variable it may be assumed to measure and what will be its mode of variation. There are obvious- ly four possibilities of interpretation. The first is that the Y-axis measures merely quantity of consumption, in units of some ideal index number. The curve would be a straight line diverging from the X-axis itself only because of a different unit than money price for meas- uring income. Anything that may be happening to the individual internally, in his mind, is ignored if not denied. This would be the rigorously objective or be- havioristic view. It is appropriate in sta- tistical economics; but even statistics im- plicitly assumes comparison and direction of choice by a principle of maximizing something. Second, this view might be modified, or restated without any change in substance, by interpreting the eco- nomic tendency or urge (to consume and to proportion expenditures in one way rather than another) in terms of a "force" on the analogy of mechanics, without assuming that any conscious ex- perience or "conation" is involved. At the opposite extreme (third) is interpretation in terms of the theory of diminishing incremental utility, in more or less the orthodox form. This is the view advocated in this paper. It includes two statements: (a) that the subject becomes economically better off, in terms of conscious (or "subconscious") experience, i.e., that he enjoys an in- creasing "quantity" (meaning intensity) of satisfaction or subjective service; and (b) that he can, and will, say that the in- creasing conscious well-being experienced in passing from a particular indifference curve Ij to the next higher one Ik is less than the increase experienced in passing from the next lower curve Ii to curve Ij. Hence the change in his well-being can be shown by a curve of decreasing up- ward slope. Fourth, this third position may be modified by dropping the second statement, leaving only the first. This last is the Slutzky position, which is at- tacked in this paper. It admits and uses comparison between levels of satisfac- tion but denies or ignores all comparison of differences between different levels- all judgment by the subject as to "how much" better off he becomes through any addition to income. This view is de- fended by appeal to the principle that entities or fundamental concepts are not to be multiplied unnecessarily-the prin- ciple known as "Occam's Razor"; its ad- vocates hold that the statement dropped is superfluous and, if not false, is at least irrelevant. The position has to be judged with reference to the psychological real- ity of decreasing increments and to its usefulness in interpreting the phenomena scientifically and for practical purposes. The validity of the decreasing addi- tions to satisfaction or subjective serv- ice derived from equal additions to con- sumption of measurable objective serv- ice, regardless of kind, has already been demonstrated in our discussion of hypo-</page><page sequence="15">REALISM AND RELEVANCE IN THE THEORY OF DEMAND 303 thetical experiments, and little remains to be said directly on that point. It is ob- vious to introspection that the successive equal "doses" of the service osi or of money could be replaced with increasing doses, experimentally so adjusted that the subject would report equal, instead of decreasing, increments of satisfaction intensity. It should go without saying that we assume psychological stability in the subject and the economic or ra- tional character of his thinking and mo- tivation. The increments of satisfaction received from increments of a single good osi might be experimentally quantified, and in a sense measured, by ascertaining how much of any good, or of the whole collection of goods previously consumed, represented by money, the subject would be willing to give up to secure an addi- tional increment of the particular good at any point in the experimental varia- tion of the latter. This could not be done for money or income as a whole, for total satisfaction can be measured only in units of itself. There may be no harm in saying that the experiments we have described con- stitute "measurement," in terms of money, of the added satisfaction de- rived from successive increments of osi, provided there is a clear understanding of the conditions and of the meaning of measurement in this connection. The satisfaction derived from osi, or its "capacity" to yield satisfaction, ordinar- ily has no clear and direct relation to any physical attribute of the service con- sumed. Further, as the service enters into a budget, it cannot be said to yield a particular kind of satisfaction or a com- plex of particular kinds, but simply added total satisfaction. Most physical services actually yield an unanalyzable and varying complex of kinds of satis- faction, involving manifold complemen- tary relations with other goods. We are dealing with a unique universe of sub- jective comparison. To investigate this new problem we must consider the rela- tions between objective measurement, subjective experience, and estimation. The measurement of any physical magnitude (any that is directly percep- tible to the senses) is a technical pro- cedure for improving upon the accuracy of a subjective judgment or estimate. The operation does not measure or change in any way the estimate itself as a quantitative experience; and, to what- ever degree of refinement measurement is carried, there always remains an ele- ment of comparison by subjective esti- mation. This source of inaccuracy is much reduced, but not eliminated, by the use of the "zero method," whereby the judgment is one of equality rather than of what multiple one magnitude is of another. (The theory of demand and of all forms of indifference curves runs in terms of the zero method; at any chosen position the subject judges that a small shift in his expenditure makes no difference in his level of satisfaction.) Physical mechanics is built around the three primary magnitudes of space, mass (or force [see below, pp. 305 ff .]), and time; and in physics as a whole the units for measuring other magnitudes are viewed as derived from these three elementary "dimensions." (Here we need think only of the classical or Newtonian conceptual system.) Of the three, space is measured in a primary and direct sense, which is not true of the other two or of any other magnitude whatever. It is only space- and, practically speaking, only length, not even area and volume-that we can cut into equal pieces, compare the pieces for equality by superposition, and count their number. The role of estimation in</page><page sequence="16">304 FRANK H. KNIGHT this process is obvious, and the rela- tion between measurement of distance (whether by the crude yardstick method or by one which is in any degree more re- fined) and its outright estimation need not be discussed. All other magnitudes, including time and mass (or force), are measured indirectly through the meas- urement of length, by the use of some apparatus based on a theory which brings the magnitude to be measured into correlation with a scale of length. (Usually the correlation is linear-the scale divisions on the instrument are equal-but this is a detail.) Some aspects of the relation between subjective and objective magnitudes can be brought out by the example of ther- mometry. Here, again, a length-famil- iarly, the height of a column of mercury -is assumed to measure temperature as a physical magnitude, defined by dy- namic theory, which corresponds in a general way with our sensations of warmth and cold. If the correspondence were exact in all cases, we should hardly need thermometers; and if there were no correspondence at all, it is idle to specu- late as to what might have been the de- velopment of our concept of temperature as a measurable quantity. But the quan- titative changes in sensation are none the less real, whether the correspondence with the thermometer follows some non- linear function (such as the logarithmic relation of the Weber-Fechner law, roughly valid for some magnitudes with- in some limits) or whether there is no simple functional relation. In the nature of the case there can be no physical measurement of the feeling of tempera- ture (or of the estimate of length); this is a matter of direct experience and of verbal reporting. Yet either judgment- that the temperature as felt shows a linear correspondence with that meas- ured, that they are related by any other function, or that they are not related- proves with equal and complete conclu- siveness that temperature as felt is quantitative (in the cardinal sense). The subject "knows" approximately-he can estimate-whether a second change in his feeling is equal to or greater or less than a preceding one, and experimental changes could be adjusted to seem equal; and there would literally be no sense in saying that any such judgment is wrong. We hold it to be self-evident that what has been said of temperature is true of every subjective variable, regardless of its nature or relation to a measurable physical variable as a cause-or in what sense, if at all, we attribute the experi- ence to such a cause. Whenever our minds judge one experience to be greater, more intense, than another, it is always possible to distinguish between (approxi- mately) equal and unequal degrees of change. An illustration which seems made to order for expository purposes (and has been used) is the grading of examination papers, in any subject from arithmetic to any branch of aesthetics, or grading human performance of any kind. Of course, the effort to grade is an effort to quantify a magnitude which is assumed to be objective in some sense, in contrast with the mere subjective experience or feeling of the grader; estimation of merit must be distinguished from mere liking. But this fact is immaterial for the argu- ment, as long as there is no conceivable possibility of physically measuring the "real" merit of the object or performance or of describing it in terms of physical qualities. We need not go into the spe- cial problem of the objectivity of values as magnitudes or inquire as to how far "real" values enter into economic desire and satisfaction or investigate the rela-</page><page sequence="17">REALISM AND RELEVANCE IN THE THEORY OF DEMAND 305 tion between the aesthetic merit and the economic (money) value of the same ob- jects. What is essential is only the fact that grading is done, and on a linear numerical scale; this is conclusive for the fact of quantification and retnoves the main question from the sphere of argument. Manifestly, the activity is one of estimation, not of measurement, in any proper use of the word. The word "measure" ought to be used very cau- tiously in connection with distinctively human data, i.e., with respect to any but the simplest physical capacities of man, such as speed in running, the lifting of weights, and the like, and the ability to estimate measurable physical quanti- ties. Averaging estimates or guesses is not measuring and should not be so called, though the notion of "reliability" implies objectivity of some kind. Experiment shows that if the same person holds one hand for a brief interval in very warm water and the other in cold and then places both hands in water at an intermediate temperature, the latter will at the same time feel cold to one hand and warm to the other. But even such a fact has nothing to do with the quantitative character of the feeling of warmth or coldness in either hand or with the validity of its quantitative es- timation by the subject. Where measure- ment is impossible, our confidence in the validity of estimates of magnitude or rank can itself only be estimated. It may well be true that the reliability of rank- ing is greater than that of estimation of differences in degree, as tested by repeti- tion by the same or a different estimator. The essential fact here is that wherever it is possible to say of three "experienced data" of any kind, A, B, and C, that C is "greater" than B and B is greater than A, it is also possible to compare the dif- ferences, i.e., to judge (though perhaps with less accuracy) whether C is greater than B by an amount-a difference- greater or less than that by which B is greater than A. We certainly make such estimates in economic choice.13 We turn now to the relation between the first and second of our four possible views of the theory of choice-a purely behavioristic interpretation and one which runs in terms of "force." Early in the history of modern physics objection was raised to use of the concept of force, on the double ground that it is never open to direct observation and that it is not objective but animistic or anthropo- morphic. It was (and is) pointed out that we observe or measure only the effects of forces and contended that it would be simpler and more candid to talk only about effects, i.e., equations of motion, in relation to observed and meas- ured antecedents or conditions. The place of motive in economic choice pre- sents a closely parallel problem. In mechanics the issue arises at the very beginning, in the question as to what it is that is measured in the second of the three primary units-grams or pounds. Those who repudiate the notion of force contend that the gram (or pound) is a unit of mass and that the word "force" is simply a shorter designation of the de- 13 The writer knows of only one case of quantita- tive variation in a physical quality where it is possi- ble to rank but impossible to space the ranks along a linear or numerical scale. This is the case of the hardness of solids as determined exclusively by the scratching test. In this case, and in any case where magnitudes are ranked and only the rank is given, no valid numerical correlation with any other series can be computed. Correlation between ranked series, or of such a series with any measured vari- able, rests on an arbitrary assumption that all the ranks are equally spaced along a scale. Estimates of differences are fairly definite only within the range of direct observation. In this fact also there is a difference of degree from the com- parison of primary magnitudes.</page><page sequence="18">306 FRANK H. KNIGHT fining relationship, the product of mass by acceleration. The expression f = ma should then be treated as a definition and not as an equality. This reasoning is plausible, but any effort to follow the procedure advocated runs at once into insuperable difficulty; for, in fact, mass is not measured and not experienced directly, but only as force. In practice, the unit is a unit of weight and is measured with the balance or by elastic deformation (of a steel spring or the like). Theoretically, mass should be measured by comparing the accelerations of two masses when these "interact." But, unfortunately for the theory, inter- action itself is never directly observed, or even inferred, without the mediation of some force. It has, of course, long been known that impact is no exception to this statement, that literal impact be- tween rigid solids is both unreal and theoretically impossible, since it would involve infinite acceleration. (In modern theory mass would be infinite at a rela- tive velocity equal to that of light.) The empirical phenomenon of impact in- volves either elastic or permanent de- formation, and neither can be inter- pretively conceived without using the idea of force as an elementary datum. The palpable fact is that the most ele- mentary mechanical phenomena cannot be thought of in purely empirical terms, in the meaning which our minds seem to crave, namely, visual observation. The impossibility of such a "behavioristic" view should be evident to reflection and has been pointed out by theoretical physicists.'4 I4 See, e.g., a review article by H. Poincar6, "Les Idees de Hertz sur la mecanique," Revtue generate des sciences pures et appliquees, VIII, No. i6 (August 3o, i897), 734-43. Of course, all real, observable, terrestrial, physi- cal phenomena also involve friction and loss of en- ergy. This concept is even more metaphysical than It may be admitted that the notion of force "seems" more anthropomorphic and subjective than other qualities of objects which seem to be more directly perceived. When we see, or picture in thought an interaction between two bodies, such as the familiar impact of billiard balls, we think we observe (see, literally or in imagination) the change in motion and only infer the operation of force. And the inference seems to involve "reading into" the physical process something from an imagined experience of our own-either tactile pressure or muscular effort. However, reflection makes it a serious question whether we do not observe force at least as truly and "primarily" as we observe anything, specifically, when we see objects. We cer- tainly feel both weight and inertia in our own bodily members and in objects which exert pressure upon us or offer re- sistance to our efforts to change their state of rest or motion. It is noteworthy that the qualities early distinguished as "primary" are those perceived in this way, in contrast with visual properties as secondary; and it is an accepted doc- trine of psychology that the visual rec- ognition of physical objects in their external three-dimensional reality is learned through the education of the eyes by tactile sensation, pressure, and movement or muscular kinesthesis. In fact, no one has ever proposed a distinc- tion acceptable to critical common sense between what we perceive and what we infer. WVe think we see objects, but if in thinking we go back of immediate (adult) that of force, specifically since it involves the notion of potential energy. The problem of friction and its analogue in economic phenomena will be touched upon later. We need not go into the modern replace- ment of the force concept by field-theory, beyond noting that hyperspace raises equal difficulty for common sense.</page><page sequence="19">REALISM AND RELEVANCE IN THE THEORY OF DEMAND 307 experience, what we really perceive is light waves or some physicochemical change in eye or nerve or brain. The dif- ference between the cognition of force and perception by sight (and perhaps hearing) seems to be that one perceives a force only when it is acting directly on his own body, while vision (and in a sense hearing and smell, but not taste) "report" on objects at a distance. How- ever, we usually do not see anything un- less we voluntarily look at it (in contrast with hearing and smell); but we believe things "visibly" exist whether we mo- mentarily see them or not, and the ap- parent anthropomorphism of force rests on an unwillingness to assume that they similarly exert force. In human, and specifically in econom- ic, behavior, motive-i.e., desire for things or their services or for experi- ences of "satisfaction"-is the analogue of force in mechanics. Objects of choice may be thought of as exerting a "pull" upon the subject and so causing a re- sponse in behavior. (Repulsions can al- ways be interpreted in positive terms, and we need not inquire into the ground of the occasional negative quality of the feeling.) But in the field of conduct, the a fortiori argument for the reality of the force (motive) is irresistibly conclusive. If interpretive thinking cannot do with- out the notion of force as a reality in physical nature, it becomes arbitrary in the nth degree to rule motive out of our conception of the conduct of human be- ings, where everyone is directly aware of it in his own experience and has the most certain knowledge of its reality in others. Our knowledge of what is in other minds is more certain than that which we have of the reality of the physical world, and prior to the latter. All our common- sense knowledge of the world of objects and especially all of our scientific knowl- edge manifestly depend on valid inter- communication with other minds, since no observation is regarded as valid un- less it is or can be confirmed through other observers. Our thinking about conduct must conform to common-sense introspection and intelligible intercommunication, which always run in terms of "reasons" for action or choice, meaning ends or motives. In the discussion of conduct we cannot separate description from teleo- logical interpretation-the "what" from the "why" in this sense-what is done from what is achieved or expected to be achieved. Motive in relation to con- duct-as a form of answer to the ques- tion "Why?"-is an intermediate and ambiguous category, much like force in relation to motion. Under critical scru- tiny motive tends to "go over" one way or the other, giving place either to a purely empirical (perceptual but not really physical) view of behavior as tak- ing place in accord with scientific laws or to an idealistic, subjectivistic world view. But in the one direction lies naive materialism and in the other "solipsism" -equally impossible positions.I5 I5 To the earlier distinction between primary and secondary qualities-the former supposed really to exist in things, the latter only in the mind of the ob- server-a nineteenth-century school of thought add- ed "tertiary" qualities to take care of values. Apart from the dubious character of the distinctions as drawn, this scheme still fails to take account of an- other distinction which is even more important for both theoretical and practical thinking. That is the difference between the mere fact of being desired and having "value" in some objective meaning. It is a distinction which everyone constantly makes, and cannot help making, though many will "argue" that value is "really" nothing but desiredness. The truth is rather that all perception or cognition of fact rests on value judgments, in the weighing of evidence, not different in kind from those of aesthetics or morals. This "reducing" process may go further; it is also familiar in pseudo-scientific argument that desire it- self becomes merely a "tendency to react." Here "tendency" apparently has the meaning of a force,</page><page sequence="20">308 FRANK H. KNIGHT There is a special reason (motive!) against admitting motive into the inter- pretation of economic choice, in that choices do not seem to correspond ac- curately with motives. This is true with respect to other persons, and also of one's own choices, viewed with detachment or from a later point in time. This dis- crepancy is partly a matter of error in choice itself and partly one of error in the assignment of motives, including one's own. Probably everyone makes choices "really knowing" at the time that he will be sorry afterward-or will feel sorry-rightly or wrongly! In physi- cal causality the fact that we know a force only by inference from its effects means that discrepancy between the two is impossible. When any force known to be operating does not fully and accurate- ly account for an observed effect, we confidently impute the difference to some other force, known or unknown. Why we do not spontaneously and finally do the same in the case of human re- sponses raises the ultimate problem of freedom. With respect to freedom or will the essential fact is that we "know too much" about human motivation to con- sider it exhaustively interpretable in terms of antecedent physical conditions as causes. Especially, we know indubi- tably the complex fact of error. We have to assume that the behavior of inert ob- jects is not affected by effort or by think- ing which is aimed at solving problems and so is not like human choice, inherent- ly subject to error. This also means that freedom in choice involves more than or force component, if it has any meaning at all. In scientific economics, of course, we are concerned only with the quality of desiredness, without regard to any basis it may have in valuation in the higher sense or even to the "satisfaction" which may actual- ly follow upon choice and action. mere contingency or chance or caprice, and ordinarily more than "arbitrary" thought and action. The philosophical question of whether the comparison of satisfactions (utili- ties) should be thought of as a compari- son between magnitudes which exist separately and are quantified separately or whether the recognition of utility in- herently involves a comparison has a certain parallel in the case of force. We are apparently unable to think of any force as existing and acting entirely apart from some other force, or a "re- sistance" of some sort (Newton's third law of motion). It is also evident that the idea of economic value, or utility, al- ways arises out of the necessity of choos- ing between alternative "goods," more or less different in kind. The giving-up of an alternative good is the meaning of cost. The relativity of desires is more intimate than that of forces. But in mechanics forces are dealt with one at a time, and the same is true of desires in economics; any one desire or attraction is a distinct factor and the associated satisfaction an independent variable under any actual conditions of choice. (However, discus- sion of the psychological effect of varia- tion in the consumption of a single good, under the condition that it is the only one consumed by the individual, in place of reasonable ceteris paribus conditions, is one of the "classical errors" from which theory needs to free itself.) Desire for a particular service might, of course, be viewed as a mutual attraction between the human being and the good, as in the case of masses, electric charges, or mag- netic poles; but the economist should doubtless follow the common-sense pro- cedure of locating the attraction in the "mind" of the human being. In fact, even physicists speak of the magnet one- sidedly attracting its armature, the earth</page><page sequence="21">REALISM AND RELEVANCE IN THE THEORY OF DEMAND 309 the apple, etc., where theory makes the attraction mutual.'6 One or two observations on the use of physical analogy in economic analysis should be added, by way of warning, par- ticularly with reference to the concepts of statics and dynamics and to units and dimensions. We have pointed out that the fundamental economic magnitudes have the nature and dimensionality of flow or flux, not of existent masses. In an economic system the forces and their equilibrium relate to rates of flow, i.e., the distribution of a current among al- ternative paths, under a (difference of) pressure or potential of some sort. There is no direct analogy with equilibrium between objects stationary in a field of force. The true physical analogy would require an elaborate construction hardly undertaken so far in the literature, to the writer's knowledge. It is not to be under- taken here, but one or two points call for mention. Of the three elementary dimensions in (Newtonian) mechanics, only time car- ries over into economics with at all the same meaning.' As to space, economists i6 For many problems in price theory, it is con- venient and admissible to treat money as an abso- lute measure of value, hence to view both price and utility changes as entirely relative to money. This assumption gives rise to serious problems in account- ing practice. The economist must have in mind, wherever it is relevant, that the value of money does change, in terms both of objective purchasing-power and of subjective utility. The ultimate practical con- cern of the economist (as of all scientists) is with "welfare"; but to deal with this he must first have a sound scientific theory of utility, both in relative and in absolute terms, on the analogy of a force causing and explaining choice but consciously known to the choosing subject. Ultimately, "satisfaction" must be conceived, for the purpose of economic analysis, as only one ingredient or factor in human well-being; others may, in fact, have greater practical impor- tance. '7 Professor Sorokin in his recent work, Socio- Cultural Causality, Space, Time (Durham, N.C., speak of direction and velocity of change; but it seems impossible either to bring these notions into any intelligible rela- tion with the three-dimensional field of Euclidean space or to formulate any usable conception of economic hyper- space. The analogy of mass, in relation to force, presents even greater difficul- ties; and we probably cannot formulate any usable analogy for physical friction, involving energy loss. The best "model" for an economic system would seem to be one based on the phenomena of electric current, generated by a large number of interconnected sources and distributing itself through a complex network of cir- cuits. One should, of course, begin with the case of a single generator feeding a number of circuits, as the analogue for a Crusoe economy. At the outset the role of inertia would be ignored, as electro- magnetic induction is ignored in Ohm's law stating the relations for electricity. The relation between potential, resist- ance, and flow-maximizing satisfaction under diminishing utility-will be less simple than Ohm's formula, because elec- trical resistance is invariant with respect to current; but it is quite manageable mathematically. Another serious difficul- ty lies in the fact that in the human case the treatment of the "source" itself, the human being, as either simple or con- stant involves heroic abstraction, even if we could think of our Robinson Cru- soe as using only his own "person" in the satisfaction of his economic wants, ig- noring all other instrumentalities. The difficulty centers in the concept of capital (the whole complex "source" itself) and its maintenance and/or growth or de- cline. (Capital theory is the central dif- ficulty in any attempt at rigorous formu- I943), advocates developing a special conception of time for use in social theory.</page><page sequence="22">310 FRANK H. KNIGHT nation of economic relationships and processes.) Turning from theoretical to practical difficulties, it is actually quite unrealistic to think of the functional (cause-and- effect) relations between economic vari- ables as remaining unchanged through a real change in any independent vari- able.'8 There is always a significant "lag" in time; and in the meantime other things will not remain "equal." The de- mand curve (our special topic in this paper) affords an excellent illustration, being undoubtedly the most solidly real of all the functional relations dealt with in economic theory. The individual curve for a particular good describes a theoret- ical position of equilibrium in the rela- tion between price and quantity taken. In reality, any change in the price, un- less infinitely gradual, will carry the rate of consumption to a point off the curve, and it will "tend" to return to the curve at a new point. But conceptual in- terpretation of the lag of consumption change behind price change involves a causal sequence bearing some analogy to the action of a force against a resist- ance in which inertia is combined with friction (opposing the redistribution of a flow among alternate paths). The result to be expected under stationary condi- i8 This is a convenient place for the important observation that price theory must explain a change in any dependent variable by a change in a really independent one, i.e., as the effect of some force im- pinging on the price system from without and to be explained or treated by some other science. No price change can be validly treated as a cause, except for changes in the situation of some individual or lim- ited sector of the economy, where the price change is due to some cause entirely outside the area con- sidered. Error in this regard is frequently met with, especially in the work of the earlier writers. Much of Ricardo's reasoning is nonsensical on this account. Of course, it is also vital to avoid the blunder of making incompatible assumptions as to the classifi- cation and interrelations of dependent and inde- pendent variables. tions would be "damped oscillations," settling down at a new point on the curve. The nature of the concepts required for interpreting such phenomena calls loud- ly for investigation, particularly with respect to the possibility of finding any magnitude which can be assumed to re- main constant, on the analogy of the conservation principles of mechanics (with or without allowance for energy loss). This line of argument suggests a basis for a pure theory of economic fluc- tuations. But the realism of such theo- rizing would be severely limited because the heart of the phenomena in the hu- man case is uncertainty, error, and spec- ulation (with some analogy to mental inertia!) in the thinking by which eco- nomic behavior is controlled, and these are not considered to be present in me- chanical processes. For numerous and important reasons, economic theory cannot approach the analytical realism of mechanics-remote from the empirical facts and the condi- tions of practical problems as are the as- sumptions of the latter science. Motives are not analogous to forces, i.e., merely concepts for interpreting conduct, which could be left out, to yield an empirical description of the causal sequence in physical or behavioristic terms. As al- ready observed, we "know too much"; we have direct knowledge, not only that motives are present but that they do not correspond with hypothetical forces connecting behavior with its antecedent conditions. Their operation disrupts the uniformity of sequence. In the first place, action rarely leads to exactly the in- tended result, because it is always affect- ed by error, which also is of several kinds. And, beyond this fact, ends are never really given. Actual desires are partly a matter of curiosity-the urge to explore-giving rise to the paradox</page><page sequence="23">REALISM AND RELEVANCE IN THE THEORY OF DEMAND 3II of expected surprise as an important ele- ment in motivation. A different matter is the problem-solving interest, the quest of the "right" answer to some question, which it is a sheer contradiction to treat as an end given in advance. Well-being is largely of this nature, the answer to an unsolved problem, to be sought through "intelligent" experiment. Finally, the practical significance of economic theory is in the field of social action, not of individual conduct. Par- ticularly in a democratic society the in- strumental pattern of means and end hardly fits this problem at all. It would have some application, though even then a very limited one, if we could think of the social problem as that of an ab- solute dictator, entirely outside of soci- ety and viewing his "subjects" merely as passive instruments for his own pur- poses. (They would have to be "lower" than any real slaves or even beasts of burden.) In free society the primary ob- jective is agreement on terms of associa- tion, and the secondary objective is agreement on "right" terms and on the "best" ends and procedures. Actually, association itself has only to a limited extent the purpose assumed in economic analysis-co-operation for the achieve- ment of any ends, of individuals or of groups. To a very large extent it is a matter of formulating the rules of a game, in which individuals do indeed pursue ends, but ends symbolic in char- acter, set up to make activity interest- ing, instrumental to this purpose, and in large part effective because of their con- flicting or competitive nature. The intel- ligence involved in playing games is a very different kind of faculty from either technical-instrumental rationality or the thinking used in apportioning means. Incidentally, the ability to invent games or improve the rules is much less com- mon in the human species than these other capacities-which still do not ex- haust the ambiguity of the word "intel- ligence." V. CONSUMER S SURPLUS The consumer's surplus idea was doubtless first adumbrated by Dupuit; but the term and the classical treatment come from Marshall, and the general observations to be offered here will be oriented primarily to his treatment. It has extremely little practical significance, but a correct exposition is useful in bringing out the relations between the individual demand curve and indiffer- ence curves, with which it is much con- fused. It may also be useful for the pure theory of monopoly, in connection with perfectly classified monopoly price. Marshall defines the concept as the ex- cess of the price which a person would be willing to pay rather than go without the thing, over that which he actually does pay (Principles [8th ed.], p.124). We shall see that this definition is incorrect as well as loosely stated. The amount by which a person's total expenditure for a good under demand conditions (buy- ing freely at a given price) is less than he would be willing to pay for the same amount rather than do without it al- together does not correspond with the value to him of having the good avail- able at the price rather than unavail- able-other conditions being the same'9 -and the latter is the essential idea. There can be no question of the "theo- retical reality" of the concept of con- '9 For simplicity we assume that all the individ- ual's income is spent for consumption (no saving) and also, of course, that we are comparing an initial with a final state of equilibrium in the individual's use of his income. We need not consider here the highly problematical use of the concept in connec- tion with collections of commodities and/or groups of persons, as in the theory of foreign trade.</page><page sequence="24">3I2 FRANK H. KNIGHT sumerl's surplus, as defined, and it would need to be considered by a rational in- dividual in the situation used by Mar- shall as an illustration. That (as will be recalled) is the case of a man choosing between living in a modern city and in a primitive community (central Africa) where the products available are as- sumed to have the same prices but where the same money income purchases less "value" because some products are not to be had. (To make the comparison valid, we must assume that there are no compensating advantages in other uses of income and that the choice is perma- nent and the income the same, so as to exclude temporary residence in the prim- itive community and saving for later ex- penditure in the higher civilization.) The problem is to find an unambiguous measure or expression for the advantage, in terms of money. One difficulty in connection with Mar- shall's theory is that of forming any clear and defensible conception of what is meant by neglecting the change in the marginal utility of money. In the main argument, based on the purchase of tea for domestic consumption, which is in- troduced "in order to give definiteness to our notions" (Principles, pp. I25-27), the object seems to be to set up the as- sumption that there is no difference be- tween a demand curve for tea (under the conditions of free purchase) and a mar- ginal utility curve or an indifference curve in the price form. This is also clearly implied in the discussion of the diagram in his footnote on page I 28. But the whole argument is economically non- sensical; to make the various curves identical or to give meaning to the area under the demand curve, we must prac- tically assume that all the curves are horizontal; and this assumption not only defies the facts but eliminates con- sumer's surplus altogether. A second interpretation of the Mar- shallian assumption is adopted in a brief and ingenious discussion by A. Hender- son. It is that "the marginal rate of sub- stitution between X and money is inde- pendent of income. 120 This view seems to be neither a reasonable interpretation of Marshall's position nor economically defensible. It would make the demand curve and the indifference curves inde- pendent of the individual's income, and, as argued above, this would also make the consumption independent of the price. The most plausible view would again treat the indifference-combina- tions curves as straight lines, the other curves as horizontal and coincident. (It is geometrically possible to introduce, respectively, curvature and declining slope, as Henderson does.) The assump- tion that the demand has neither income nor price elasticity is not impossible, as an approximation, for an unimportant commodity over a limited range. That is, within this range, the consumer may buy approximately the amount of X he would consume if it were a free good, while at a lower income or a higher price he will not buy it at all. If the assumption is gen- eralized, it means that the consumer's only response to price or income change will be to add fixed amounts of different goods to his budget or to drop them, as the case may be. A third possibility is to take Marshall as meaning quite literally what he seems to say, most explicitly in his mathemati- cal note (p. 842), namely, that "the mar- 20 See "Consumer's Surplus and the Compensat- ing Variation," Review of Economic Studies, VIII (940-4), II7-2I, esp. ii9, n. I. Professor Lange called my attention to this paper. I have found it helpful, in spite of inability to accept some of the author's conclusions, for reasons which will presently be indicated in part.</page><page sequence="25">REALISM AND RELEVANCE IN THE THEORY OF DEMAND 3I3 ginal utility of money to the individual purchaser is the same throughout." That is, money is assumed to have an "abso- lute" marginal utility in the consumer's equilibrium position from which we start (with or without the opportunity to purchase X freely at a fixed price), and this magnitude is assumed to be in- variant with respect to the amount of income spent for X, as the price of X varies from zero to infinity.21 Whether 21 This assumption seems to be implied by the statement that "in mathematical language the neg- lected elements would generally belong to the second order of small quantities" (Principles of Economics, p. 13 2, n. i). Marshall goes on to chide Professor Nich- olson for not recognizing "the legitimacy of the fa- miliar scientific method by which they are neglect- ed." In spite of diffidence in challenging Marshall- and Pigou (Economics of Welfare [ist ed.], p. 935) on such a matter, the present writer must suggest that this mathematical argument is invalid. The theory of orders of infinitesimals does not seem to be applicable unless total utility is assumed to be repre- sented by an algebraic expression of a fairly simple type, and this clearly cannot be done. The question of what can be neglected, and in comparison with what, is purely one of fact; and the facts are magni- tudes which are a matter of estimation only, and their importance, absolute or relative, varies indefi- nitely with the particular good in question and de- pends on many other conditions. (This matter of what magnitudes are practically negligible is of great importance for other problems in economic theory where unknown functions are in- volved, notably the conception of perfect competi- tion among producers. It is hard to give much mean- ing to elaborate curves of total and marginal cost for a firm assumed to be of negligible size, which means that the whole diagram reduces to the area of a point!) In sec. 4 (pp. I32-33) Marshall discusses as an exception the effect of a rise in the price of X, spe- cifically in connection with the "Giffen paradox." Here, as the price of X increases, an increased quan- tity of X is purchased-the consumption of bread by very poor families being used as an illustration. As our previous argument has shown, what this case really illustrates is the confusion which results from drawing a demand curve on the assumption that all other prices are constant. What happens in such cases is a consequence of a disastrous fall in the value of money to the buyers affected, though not neces- sarily connected with a change in its value in the social economy, as measured by any general index number. From the standpoint of the theory of de- mand, it is the spurious problem of the "income ef- fect." the change so neglected would really be negligible or not manifestly depends on the importance of X in the consumer's budget. This, in turn, is partly a matter of the total number of commodities con- sumed, partly one of the intrinsic quali- ties of X, and partly of its complemen- tarity relations with other goods. Mar- shall explicitly makes an exception for "commodities some supply of which is necessary for life" (p. I33, n. i). He ap- parently fails to recognize that necessity is entirely a matter of degree or that no particular commodity as bought in the market under ordinary conditions is nec- essary; finally, in assuming that we can know the individual's utility (satisfac- tion) function for money, he fails to see that income as a whole is in a sense nec- essary, but not in any definable amount. His suggestion, that we take the neces- sary supply for granted and estimate the total utility of the excess over this amount, must be applied to money, not to a particular commodity, and must be interpreted to mean an income which would actually yield zero satisfaction. The problem of consumer's surplus is that of finding a monetary measure or expression for an increment of total satis- faction which accrues to a consumer through having the opportunity to pur- chase a freely chosen amount of a par- ticular good at a particular price, in com- parison with a situation in which the good is not available and all other condi- tions are the same. In the second situa- tion he will spend the same amount of money on other goods at the same prices (but not necessarily quite the same list of other goods), freely distributing his ex- penditure among these. The problem lies in the field of value dynamics, surveyed in Section II above, not in that of price- quantity relations under given condi- tions. To begin with, it is impossible</page><page sequence="26">3314 FRANK H. KNIGHT literally to measure in money a change in the total utility of an income which it- self is expressed in money. The only problem which can be pictured as real is that which is indicated by the third assumption we have been considering. We must measure a change in total satis- faction in units of the absolute satisfac- tion yielded by an increment of money income under some given conditions, as- suming that this magnitude is not changed by the actual change in the use of the increment of income in question. Y P t . n m 0 xi X x FIG. 2 Of course, it would be changed, more or less. If the change is substantial, the re- sult is merely that our measurement still runs in terms of the original value; it will not become relative to the actual new value. To handle this problem analytically, it will be useful to have in mind three curves, as shown in Figure 2. Curve A shows the variation in the relative mar- ginal utility of good (service) X, meas- ured by money. It is really an indiffer- ence curve, being drawn under the condi- tion that the subject actually purchases each successive small unit of X at the maximum price he is willing to pay, after buying the earlier units seriatim on these terms. Curve B shows the same facts but with prices averaged out. It is so drawn in relation to A that any three-cornered area, r, is equal to the area, s, for any point, pi (see shaded areas). That is, the ordinates of B show the highest price at which any quantity of X can be sold to the consumer, if he is free only to take or leave the whole amount. (We do not go into the meaning of curves A or B beyond the point Q, where A inter- sects the X-axis.) D is a demand curve. We cannot draw this curve from the data of the other two. We know only that it will run between A and B except for the terminal point P on the vertical axis. This means that at any positive (relative) price at which the consumer buys good X at all, he will buy less of it if free to choose the amount than he can be made to buy if he must take all or none at a maximum average price (or the price he will pay for any amount is less than he could be made to pay under the more restricted terms of choice). But the amount he will freely buy is greater than that which would have the same margin- al utility in terms of money at his stop- ping-point if he bought all the earlier units seriatim at the maximum price for each in turn (or bought the whole block at his maximum total or average price). This is because under the demand condi- tion he will have money left after reach- ing the terminal point of the second condition and will spend some of this for X (if all goods are "simple"). This last fact is a consequence of the existence of diminishing utility and of consumer's surplus. The consumer's surplus obviously is not measured by the three-cornered area bounded by the price axis, the demand curve, and the upper boundary of the ex- penditure rectangle Opmx, Ox being the amount purchased at price p under de-</page><page sequence="27">REALISM AND RELEVANCE IN THE THEORY OF DEMAND 3I5 mand conditions. In fact, the area under a demand curve has no economic meaning whatever. Consumer's surplus as a sub- jective magnitude is the difference be- tween the total satisfaction yielded by the quantity of a particular good freely purchased at any price and that which would be secured by freely spending the same amount of money for other goods at (just below) the actual uniform margin. In terms of money it must be the money value of this difference. The second al- ternative is, of course, identical with spending the same money for good X under indifference conditions (however represented graphically), which by defi- nition makes it a matter of indifference what quantity of X is purchased, includ- ing zero amount. The surplus should not be measured by the difference between two different money expenditures for the same quantity of X, since this result differs from the value determined by the other comparison.22 To obtain (on this form of diagram) the money measure of the difference- the surplus-we must first locate the point t on curve B, which subtends with the two axes a rectangle of the same area as the expenditure rectangle under the demand curve for the given demand price p. The magnitude sought is, then, the area of the rectangle cut off from this total-expenditure rectangle by the ordi- nate of this point, i.e., at xi. It is the 22 See Hicks, op. cit., pp. 38-40; also Henderson, oP. cit., p. ii8. It is rather strange that Henderson slips into this error after making the statement in italics on the first page of his article. A minor slip in Henderson's argument is the statement (p. ii8) that the consumer's surplus, defined as the differ- ence in two expenditures for the same quantity of X, is "the maximum increase in return which the seller could obtain through negotiating all-or-none bar- gains with [the] consumer." It is the maximum in- creasefor the same amount of X. The maximum with- out this unjustifiable condition would depend on the cost curve of the seller and on special conditions of bargaining (see below, p. 3i6). area of the rectangle xinmx. The "indifference - expenditure rectangle," Opitxi, has, of course, the same area as that under curve A between the price axis and the ordinate at x.23 Since, as repeatedly emphasized, the curve of marginal utility relative to money, or the indifference curve in any form, cannot be drawn from demand data, all this procedure is purely format and without practical meaning. Its only use is to clarify certain analytical con- cepts and to prevent making certain er- rors. The primary error in Marshall's analysis, and in the textbooks which have commonly followed the same pro- cedure, is that of identifying or confus- ing the demand curve with the curve of marginal utility in terms of money and of treating the area under the demand curve as the measure of total satisfac- tion. A theoretical measure of consumer's surplus could be derived more simply in graphic terms by using a series of indif- ference-combinations curves for quanti- ties of money and of good X. It must be emphasized that the procedure would still be purely hypothetical, since market data do not provide the facts required for drawing indifference curves. These 23 We might have proceeded by locating hypo- thetically the one appropriate point on curve A and drawing a horizontal line pit of the right length to yield the equivalent equal-expenditure rectangle without drawing the whole curve B. If the marginal utility under indifference conditions is assumed identical with the marginal utility under demand conditions, for the same quantities, curves A, B, and D will all coincide, and consumer's surplus will disappear. Professor Viner has pointed out the fallacy of confusing the demand curve with the equivalent of an indifference-combinations curve (see Studies in the Theory of International Trade [New York, '9371, pp. 573-74). In classroom lectures he also presents a graphic measure of consumer's surplus, showing the difference.</page><page sequence="28">316 FRANK H. KNIGHT might be had only from actual experi- mentation with strictly classified monop- oly price. But it would also be necessary to establish conditions under which the buyer would not know or suspect the nature of his situation or in which pur- chasers are, in fact, so numerous that any one is negligible to the seller, while, at the same time, purchase for resale is somehow excluded. Otherwise the situa- tion will be one of bargaining and "bluff- M A.1~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ pi FIG. 3 ing," between a monopoly and a monop- sony, and the price will be indeterminate within a range depending on the details of the two curves. However, for the pur- pose of clarifying analytical procedure (as before) we may impose the arbitrary conditions called for and proceed. Our figure embodies the same basic diagram and notation employed by Hen- derson, and before him (in an incomplete form) by Hicks (Fig. 3). The point M on the vertical axis shows the money in- come of the individual. The line MP" is a line of slope p, where p is the price of X. It is tangent to some indiffer- ence curve I2 at P, which point marks the position of equilibrium for the con- sumer under market-demand conditions, where ON measures the amount of X bought. (For clarity the diagram is drawn off-scale, with vertical distances greatly exaggerated.) Curve II is the in- difference-combinations curve of the in- dividual for X and money, correspond- ing to income M. The vertical distance PR is, indeed, the excess amount of money the individual would pay for ON of X offered as an indivisible block, over the amount FP which he does pay in the free market. But it is not the consumer's surplus. Henderson is correct in saying that "if the individual had spent FR in buying ON of X he would have been just as well off as if the commodity had not been available, whereas in fact he only had to spend FP on it." But he overlooks the fact that the individual would also have been just as well off at any other point (than R) on indifference curve II (and as well off at any other point than P on 12). Yet he recognizes that the mon- ey measure of the difference in situation represented by the two curves is not the same at any two points on either-unless the curves are arbitrarily drawn in an admittedly indefensible way. The cor- rect comparison with free purchase is clearly the point at which he spends the same amount of money for less X and not where he spends more money for the same amount of X (in both cases paying a higher average price but not the same price in these two cases); for, if X had not been available, he would have spent the same amount on other things. To find the money measure of con- sumer's surplus, defined as we have de- fined it, we draw the horizontal line PA3, cutting the indifference curve II at R'. Spending the same amount of money FP under the indifference conditions, the</page><page sequence="29">REALISM AND RELEVANCE IN THE THEORY OF DEMAND 3I7 individual would buy A3R' (or ON") of X instead of ON; i.e., he would buy N"N less than if he bought under market conditions. The money value of this difference at the given price is NT"R" (NR" being drawn parallel to the origi- nal price line), or it is R'S. This is less than PR even if the curves are drawn ac- cording to Henderson's interpretation of Marshall's assumption, i.e., so as to have the same slope for the same X value, hence a uniform vertical distance be- tween them. A still more defensible money measure of the difference in satisfaction repre- sented by two indifference-combinations curves is afforded by the notion of a ''compensating variation." The term was introduced by Hicks as the best way of looking at consumer's surplus but was mistakenly identified by him with his graphic measure of the surplus, the line segment PR. As Henderson shows, the magnitude has two values, both different from that of the consum- er's surplus as defined by Hicks and Hen- derson and also different from our "cor- rect" definition. The measurement calls for a system of indifference-combina- tions curves beginning or terminating on the Y-axis or money axis, and it de- rives its superiority from this feature. (Hicks drew only one of these curves in this way, the one at point M.) Expressed in words, the compensating variation might, in fact, take any of four different forms. First, we may consider the position of an individual with an in- come M and without the privilege of buying X freely at a certain market price and may ask either (I-a) what is the maximum amount of income he would be willing to give up in exchange for the privilege, or (I-b) what is the minimum additional income he would accept as an equivalent to getting it. Second, we may consider the position of an individual who has an income M and also has the privilege in question and may ask (11-a) how much additional in- come he would demand to give it up, or (11-b) how much of his actual income he would be willing to give up as an alterna- tive to parting with the privilege. There are actually but two magnitudes, since I-a and 11-b are identical, as are I-b and 11-a. Henderson works out, first, I-a (equals MA2) and then 11-a (equals AIM), which he strangely says is also the Marshallian consumer's surplus. It should be noted that two of the four different magnitudes-i.e., Henderson's second form of the compensating varia- tion (11-a or AIM) and the Hicks-Hen- derson consumer's surplus (PR) will be identical if (and only if) the indifference curves are straight lines identical with the price line or are otherwise so drawn that the vertical distance between them is the same for all values of X. The other two magnitudes will be different from both, as well as between themselves, un- less still more implausible conditions are imposed. The two compensating variations are different because an individual buying X freely at the same price at different income levels will buy different amounts (if it is a "simple" good or one of any probable utility composition). The two values of the compensating variation involve the two intervals between three successive indifference curves. For an individual to be on 1I with the privilege of buying X freely at price p is equiva- lent to being on I. without the privilege; and being on 1I without it is equivalent to being on a lower curve 13 passing through A2 with the privilege open. But movement from M to AI represents a greater monetary difference on the Y- axis than movement from M to A2, be-</page><page sequence="30">318 FRANK H. KNIGHT cause more X will be bought out of a higher income at the same price, because, in turn, the marginal utility of money is lower compared with that of a given supply of any single good. The vertical or monetary distance be- tween two indifference curves, or the order of two such distances, at other points cannot be inferred from the mag- nitudes along the axis of money. This is true whether or not a linear scale is as- signed to the suppressed third axis (of utility or satisfaction). The indifference curves are projections upon the base plane of contour lines on a surface, de- fined either by a utility function or by some index function with the properties considered essential. In either case the shape of the curves depends on the char- acter of the good X and its relationships with other goods available for purchase. We can draw curves spaced equally, or in any other way, along the money axis; but their vertical spacing anywhere else obviously depends on their shape. About this we know in general only three facts. They always have a negative slope (within the significant range), they do not intersect (or meet), and they cannot have a uniform slope and vertical spacing for different values of X. This third fea- ture would involve zero income elasticity of demand for X; and this, as we have seen, is conceivable only for a good with a complex utility so arranged that dis- placement of other goods would exactly offset the diminishing utility of the vari- ous component types of satisfaction which it yields.24 The utility value of a difference in money income is still another matter. This would be measured along a third axis perpendicular to the plane of a dia- gram of the type here discussed. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO 24 We should note, finally, that the notion of maximizing consumer's surplus cannot be enter- tained (as so often assumed) as a description of ra- tional consumer behavior. Any aggregation of dis- tinct consumer's surpluses is without meaning- though conditions might justify or require treating some complex of goods as a unit. To pursue the analysis further would lead into a discussion of the familiar "antinomies of value" of Wieser el al. The suggestion that total satisfaction be increased by taxing goods of inelastic demand and subsidizing consumption of those of the opposite character would justify the taxation of free goods so as to make the consumer pay for them. It is hard to deny that this might actually increase total con- scious satisfaction, but it would hardly increase real well-being to have one's total consumption cut down to famine conditions. In the ordinary course of events, one must agree with the position of Nichol- son (see Marshall, Principles, p. I27, n. i), that the consumer is not conscious of receiving the "free satis- faction" described by the theory of consumer's sur- plus. It is a real antinomy of economic psychology, but an indubitable fact, that our feelings of satisfac- tion depend more on changes in income (or particu- lar prices) than on the absolute level-and surprise, in relation to established expectations, is also vitally important, irrespective of the accustomed standard.</page></plain_text>
