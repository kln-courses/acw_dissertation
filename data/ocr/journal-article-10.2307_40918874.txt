This Dutch doctoral dissertation undertakes an analysis of the complete corpus of Scan- dinavian myth from the vantage point of social anthropology, using the principles of structural linguistics as its heuristic tool. The thesis format almost condemns the work to certain superfluities of content, and, while the detailed review of individual mythological accounts is rewarding, summary results must, on balance, be judged mixed and, given the methodology, almost predictable. Part I has as focal points the aristocratic, martial, viricentric world picture presented in culturally homogeneous and socially dynamic early Scandinavia and the application of the model of structural linguistics to a mythological system of signs. On the first count, once past the obligatory, but conventional, review of the early Scandinavian world and its literary sources, the approach requires a certain suspension of (dis)belief, when social cohesiveness authorizes a synchronie working model in which all strands of mythical narrative are considered potentially authentic, integral, and pertinent. While forewarned by this assumption, the reader drawn from the ranks of philologists and historians of literature is still brought up short when the author cites primary sources by the use of long quotations from English translations of the 1920s and '30s. Not only is the body of myth internally consistent, but it is also without any unlit nooks or crannies or unresolved textual problems. On the second count, the endeavor to legitimate the application of signifiant and signifié, of paradigmatic and syntagmatic relationships, to the mythological narrative leads through a critique of Lévi-Strauss, yet another instance of this mercurial theorist's ability to fascinate and frustrate. But while</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 385 Lévi-Strauss' mythological universe seems to expand as a work unrolls, despite his professed lack of interest in 'content', Molenaar's transformation of content into meaningful structures, from new signifiants to new signifiés on an upper tier, entails a contraction to a small number of relational truths. Evidence is assembled for a mythological language of relatively simple syntax, condemned to seek coherent expression in the foreign and critically uneconomical vehicle of human language. Part II, the study of individual myths, is an almost welcome anti-climax to the rather arid theoretical discussion, which would have profited from specific examples drawn from the myths. Main topics here are cosmogony, cosmography, divine ethics, the identity of the gods and their magical artifacts, and the process of cosmic development. As an anthropologist, the author is concerned with kinship and its attendant problems of legitimate and illegitimate juncture, separation and location. Molenaar follows Lévi-Strauss in seeing creation myths as central to a mythological system, and what is more controversial, he sees such myths as establishing basic existential oppositions and posing fundamental social problems, then ad- vancing their resolution, often through a mediation that relies on the mutual cancellation of antithetical charges. Thus, the various births and deaths of the offspring of Ymir resolve the problem of avoiding incest in the further procreation of anthropomorphic life - gods, giants, men - all of whom are descended from a single androgynous primal being. Fundamental to Molenaar's analytic process is that in Scandinavian myth social processes find expression in physical relationships, the deep and superficial meanings, respectively, of the myths. In a similar concretization, time and space are not independent of the events and locations that fill and order them, or, indeed, of each other. Thus, the spatial sphere of the giants (nature) also represents a temporal category existing both before and after the life and rule of the gods in their world of culture. Just as the fusion of linear and cyclic time yields a spiral, so space is synthesized so that Giantland, beyond, and Underworld, below, are drawn into association in their mutual opposition to the culture of the near immortal gods of AsgarÕr. The relative simplicity of mythological language is illustrated by such common and generally recognized homologies as hair and vegetation. Similar oppositional or complemen- tary relationships and mediating dynamics are found between the microcosm and macrocosm, the horizontal here (the centre) and there (the periphery), and the vertical counterpart, the world tree. Readers will find the methodolgy reminiscent of another Dutch anthropologist, Jarich G. Oosten, whose recent work The War of the Gods: The Social Code in Indo-European Mythology also moves lightly and resolutely past textual problems. After a number of chapters of analysis, dominated by concerns for direction of movement and symbolic matching (mirroring, inversion) of actions realized or unrealized on the part of gods and giants, Molenaar's study is overtaken by a ritual language in which a phrase like "the internalization of time" is the identifier given any event or nonevent that gives a god or giant power over, or immunity from, his circumstances, what we might have called our condition humaine. A narrative impasse based on inimical relations, e.g., SkaOi's refusal to weep at Baldr's death, then becomes a break in the cosmic circuitry. For Molenaar, the central theme of Scandinavian mythology is the stoppage of time, its internalization by the gods, and the resultant problems affecting cosmic development in general and fertility and procreation in particular. The methodology developed from structural linguistics yields the conclusion that a major preoccupation of early Scandinavian society, as expressed in mytholog- ical narrative, was temporal and spatial relationships. One can only wonder how many other sets of sacred narrative could not be similarly reduced. In fairness, it must be admitted that in this exploration of space and time Molenaar also offers valuable illustrations of the impor- tance of reciprocity and commensality; of the early Scandinavian speculation on the polarity</page><page sequence="3">386 Scandinavian Studies of culture and nature; and, through their representatives, the gods and giants, of the dynamics that generate new life. The concluding Part III deals with the use of mythological language in which semantic fields separate in ordinary speech are joined in mythical narrative, characterized by its nondiscursive, trans-semantic nature. This is a consideration of myth at work; one might have expected a fuller discussion of mythopoesis. Given that those abstract relationships which have been the author's chief concern could not have been shared by the mass of the Scandinavian population, Molenaar assumes the existence of a specialized function, the '&gt;ulr, who assured the continuity and consistency of the mythological corpus (the gift of ÓÕinn in the title), in part through ritual, rite (especially initiation), and public recitation in which myths were more experienced than interpreted. The dialogue form of many of our extant texts leads Molenaar to the conclusion that in this public function the Ipulr assumed the divine character of the god whose words he spoke. This conclusion is at best questionable, as are the author's claims of the immediate relevancy of myth to an assessment of a candidate's suitability for the sacral kingship or the role of myth in the presumed Norse Männerbund and in the sharp distinction between male and female roles. The study concludes with a discussion of the transformation of mythological speech, in the Scandinavian context toward a more directly linear concept of time and, hence, causality, under the influence of Christianity. There follows a list of sources, indices of works and characters, a good bibliography (in which one might have expected to find the names of Bauschatz, de Vos, and Meletinski), and a summary in English, the last two marred, like quotations in English, by numerous typographical errors. Molenaar' s training as a social anthropologist shows to best advantage in the discussion of individual myths, although his conclusions will not satisfy all readers, who may judge that the promise of the opening theoretical discussion is not fully met. However stimulating these analyses, less for reasons of insufficient source criticism than for their reductivist conclusions, they do not convincingly validate his effort to situate Scandinavian mythology in its wider social context.
