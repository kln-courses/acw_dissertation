ABSTRACT In air bag tests without a restraining seat belt (FMVSS208) several users of the Hybrid III dummy have reported a pelvic interference problem during the tests. An insufficient range of motion and a hard metal to metal contact between the pelvis and femur has lead to unexpected chest acceleration waveforms. The paper gives a mechanical analysis of this phenomenon, explaining how the forces acting on the dummy lead to a rotation of the pelvis and femur and how forces arise between the pelvis and the chest. Finally two sample tests where the pelvic interference problem has occurred are presented. INTRODUCTION A basic level for car crashworthiness is ensured by a number of regulations. For frontal collision the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 208 [1] is one example. In the 30 mph test against a rigid barrier specified in this regulation the loading of the occupants is assessed by means of crash test dummies described in Part 572 (2). In the test the dummies placed in the front seats are only restrained by the passive restraint system of the vehicle. From MY 1998 onwards airbags will be mandatory as the passive restraint. When FMVSS 208 was first introduced in 1973 the only dummy allowed was the Hybrid II (Part 572B). During the 70s a more modem type of frontal impact crash test dummy, Hybrid III, was developed by General Motors. Among the objectives were the possibility to allow additional measurements and to achieve a higher degree of biofidelity (3). In 1983 NHTSA received a petition from GM, asking the agency to allow Hybrid III as an alternative test device for compliance in FMVSS 208. In 1986, Hybrid III was incorporated in Part 572, as subpart E. From September 1, 1997 Hybrid III will be the only dummy allowed for frontal compliance testing. Since 1984 Volvo has used the Hybrid III dummy, especially in product development testing. Until 1990 seat belts, either alone or supplemented by airbags, restrained our Hybrid III dummies in the majority of our tests. In the fall of 1990 unusually high chest-g-values were noted in tests with unrestrained Hybrid III dummies; An initial study showed that these high chest-g's always occurred in combination with abnormal femoral bending moments. The conclusion was that the abnormal chest-g peaks were a result of an interference between the dummy pelvis and femur. There was a "bottoming-out" of the hip joint at a relative small angle. This finding has since also been reported by other car manufacturers and institutions. In a contribution to Docket 74-14; notice 77, Nissan notes that metal-metal contact occurs in the Hybrid III while a corresponding interference is not seen in humans. A comparison of the anatomy of the Hybrid III and human pelvic-femoral areas is provided. Toyota and Honda in 1993 both submitted petitions regarding femur-pelvic interference, which have later been supported by Chrysler. In April 1994 the Toyota petition was granted. The problem has also been recognized by organizations such as SAE and ISO, and ideas for modifications of the dummy have been discussed. The objective of this paper is to describe, in technical terms, Volvo's analysis of the Hybrid III femur-pelvis interaction found in crash testing. 1298</page><page sequence="2">Biofidelic aspects etc. is thus not a major theme of this report and will not be treated in depth. DUMMY KINEMATICS The pelvic interference problem is a result of the pelvis and femur rotation during a crash. If these rotations reach the limit of the range of motion between the pelvis and femur, sudden high force and acceleration peaks may appear in the dummy that strongly affect the results of the crash test. To understand the kinematics of the dummy better, a typical crash sequence where the pelvic interference problem occurs is described below. First, a survey of the crash is given, then in more detail, the forces acting on the dummy, why the pelvis and femur rotate and how internal forces appear within the dummy are described. Finally two sample tests are presented where a pelvic interference has occurred. SURVEY Figure 1 shows a typical movement sequence of an unbelted Hill dummy during a frontal 0 degree, 30 mph barrier crash test according to FMVSS 208. To reduce the complexity of the figure the dummy has been drawn without skin and flesh. The main external forces acting on the dummy have been marked. These forces are; force on the chest from the airbag, force on the knees from the dashboard, force on the pelvis from the seat and force on the feet from the floor. Definitions of some dummy parts, the chest, lumbar spine, pelvis and femur are given. As the car impacts the barrier and starts to decelerate, the dummy at first continues to move forwards with constant speed. The dummy moves from the initial position A to a position B. During this sequence the airbag is triggered and deployed. The feet reach the floorpan and an upward rotation of the femurs begins (the femur and lower leg act as a link system). As the dummy reaches position В the airbag is completely filled and the knees reach the dashboard. A deceleration of the dummy begins. Between position В and С the chest is decelerated by the airbag and is moving forwards nearly without rotation. The lower body is decelerated by forces from the dashboard and from the seat. The forces acting on the lower body cause the rotation of the pelvis to begin. As the pelvis moves forward the upward rotation of the femurs continue and at position С the range of movement between the pelvis and femur comes to an end. A structural contact between the femur and pelvis appears and the pelvic rotation suddenly comes to a stop. Between position С and D the lower body (femur and pelvis) acts as one part that cani rotate. If, at Figure 1 . Survey of dummy movement and definitions. 1299</page><page sequence="3">this position, the dummy chest still has a forward movement relative to the pelvis, this movement results in a shearing of the lumbar spine. As the shear forces build up, the movement of the chest changes from a non-rotation translation into a rotation about the lumbar spine. Between position D and E the final deceleration of the chest by the airbag takes place. FORCE ANALYSIS The crash sequences В to С, С to D and D to E are discussed in more detail below. For each sequence the external forces acting on the dummy, how these forces affect the dummy movements and how internal dummy forces arise are described. Phase В to С - The crash sequence from В to С is illustrated in Figure 2a. By drawing the two positions on top of each other and using the chest as a reference, the internal displacements of the dummy and the deformation of the lumbar spine can be illustrated, Figure 2b. The resulting lumbar spine forces and the external forces acting on the upper and lower body are shown in Figure 2c. As the dummy moves from В to С the airbag force acting on the chest, Fab. and femur and seat forces, Ff and Fs, on the pelvis increase. Normally the femur and seat forces build up quicker than the airbag forces and the lower body decelerates more than the upper body during this phase giving a relative displacement between the upper and lower body. The femur and seat forces acting on the pelvis, both act below the pelvic center of gravity and a rotation of the pelvis starts. The change of pelvis angle results in a lumbar spine bending moment My. As the pelvis rotates, the point L (Figure 2a) moves upwards a distance H lifting the chest by lumbar spine compression forces, Fz. If there is a relative horizontal displacement between the chest and point L lumbar spine shear forces, Fx, appear that help rotating the pelvis. As indicated in Figure 2c the forces driving the pelvic rotation, Ff, Fs and Fx are greater and have longer levers than the forces restraining the pelvic rotation, Fz and My and the pelvic rotation accelerates. That is: Ff*d + Fs*c + Fx*b &gt; Fz*a + My The airbag forces, however, are evenly distribu- ted over the chest and the resultant force, Fat&gt;, act nearly in line with the chest center of gravity. The rotational forces and moments from the lumbar spine are small and to some extent balanced by forces from the neck. The chest is decelerated nearly without rotation. By lifting of point L the chest obtains a vertical speed upwards. Figure 2.

За - dummy movement, 3b - shear and pull of lumbar spine (undeformed lumbar spine drawn with dotted line), direction of deformation indicated by arrow, 3c - resulting forces and moments acting on the chest and pelvis. Phase С to D- The crash sequence from С to D is illustrated in Figure 3a-c. At position С the angle between the pelvis and femur reach the limit of relative displacement. A structural contact between the pelvic iliac wing and the femur occur at point FP (Figure 3a) and the pelvic rotation comes to a sudden stop by contact with the femur. Femoral shear forces, F^, and bending moments, Mfy, increase as the femur acts as a lever to stop the pelvic rotation. With the pelvis and femur locked together point L can not continue to move either upwards or forwards using pelvic rotation and if the chest still has a forward upward movement relative to the pelvis, this movement results in shearing and pulling lumbar spine forces. The course of this event is very abrupt and the previous small lumbar spine forces rapidly increase and become large. The accelerations measured in the pelvis and chest are evidently affected by these forces. The chest acceleration suddenly increases and the pelvic acceleration drops, see Figure 3d. As the lumbar spine forces increase, the movement of the chest changes from a non-rotation translation into a rotation about the lumbar spine and the lumbar spine moment changes sign (see also sample tests, figures 5 and 6).

Phase D to E. 4a - dummy movement, 4b - lumbar spine deformation decreases towards the undeformed dotted shape, 4c - decreasing lumbar spine and external forces. Phase D to E- The crash sequence from D to E is illustrated in Figure 4. As the chest rotation has started, the deformation of the lumbar spine decreases and the forces are reduced. The final deceleration of the upper body by the air bag and of the lower body by the dashboard takes place and the external forces acting on the dummy decrease as the forward movement of the dummy comes to a stop. SAMPLE TESTS Two sample air bag tests where the pelvic interference problem has occurred are presented in Figures 5 and 6. Both tests are 30 mph 0 degree frontal barrier tests using a Hybrid 3 test dummy without seat belts at the driver position. An extract of the transducer signals showing the most charachteristic signs of the pelvic interence are given, such as; Sudden peaks in the chest acceleration as the pelvic acceleration drops, a sudden increase of femoral shear force and bending moment , a sudden increase in the lumbar spine shear force and a sign change of the lumbar spine bending moment. The signals are plotted versus time in seconds. On the time-axis also the phases B, C, D and E have been marked. The arrows on the dummy indicate the positive direction of the signals. At the lumbar spine the arrows are drawn as positive forces would act on the chest and the femoral forces are drawn as positive forces would act on the upper part of the femur. To better visualize the drop in pelvic acceleration the dotted line at the pelvic acceleration in Figures 5 and 6 shows the expected shape of the pelvic acceleration as calculated from the femoral forces using the expression: pelvisacc = femurforce / pelvismass 1302</page><page sequence="6">Sample 1- Sample 1 is shown in Figure 5. Interference between the pelvis and the femur occured at approximately 72 ms leading to substantial lumbar spine forces (the dummy posture at this time is indicated by the figure). A sudden increase in chest acceleration and a drop in pelvic acceleration can be observed. The dotted line from 70 ms to 90 ms shows the expected shape of the pelvic acceleration. As the pelvic rotation comes to a stop from contact with the femur, the femur shear force and bending moment suddenly increase. Figure 5. Sample test 1 . 1303</page><page sequence="7">Sample 2- Sample 2 is shown in Figure 6. In this test there are also obvious signs of interference between the pelvis and the femur at approximately 70 ms resulting in high lumbar spine forces and abnormal chest and pelvis acceleration patterns. In this test the dynamics of the pelvic rotation was recorded using a rotational velocity transducer. This recording shows a strong correlation between the sudden stop of the pelvic rotation and the interaction between the pelvis and the chest via lumbar spine forces. Figure 6. Sample test 2. 1304</page><page sequence="8">DISCUSSION The objective of this paper has been to provide an analysis in technical terms of the Hybrid III pelvis-femur interaction in frontal crash tests where an airbag has been the only restraint. The phenomenons described above have not been noted when this passive restraint system is supplement to a three point seat belt. In Volvo's development of vehicles and systems, FMVSS 208 is only one of the tests used for assessment. While the legal requirements need to be fulfilled with margins, the majority of car accidents occur at lower speeds, and often with occupants wearing belts. To avoid suboptimization of restraint systems, tests at a range of speeds, including lower velocities, are performed with seat belts plus airbags. In these tests, no Interaction has been noticed. The detailed analysis of the interference of the pelvis and femur in the Hybrid III dummy presented above shows how the metal to metal contact can explain abnormal acceleration patterns of the chest ahd pelvis. The sudden stop in the dummy occurs at a smaller femur to pelvis angle than for a human and is of an unrealistically stiff nature. The specification for the Hybrid III is that the angle between the femur and iliac wing should be 40 * ± 10*. Measurement of this angle in several Hybrid III dummies of different age and manufacturer showed that most dummies are very close to 30*. The problem with a small angle seems to be more pronounced in more recently acquired dummies than in older ones. SAE has investigated the problem, and has proposed changes, including a larger range of motion for the pelvis-femur assembly and a soft bumper (4). The changes are currently under evaluation. Furthermore, dummies of other sizes, the design of which has been based on scaling of the 50th percentile, are being subject to evaluation for corresponding modifications. The tests described in this paper are by no means to be considered as extreme conditions as they are tests performed in accordance with FMVSS 208. The pelvis-femur interaction can be estimated to increase the chest acceleration level by as much as up to 50%. There is a risk that to ensure the required chest acceleration is reached, the restraint system would be required to be reoptimized. There is a large risk for suboptimization if non-biofidelic dummy characteristics misdirect the design efforts of occupant protection systems. A biofidelic response of the dummy is very important when designing e.g. knee bolsters and airbags, otherwise the systems are balanced for the dummy properties rather than for those of the human. The efforts to modify the pelvic-femoral region should be encouraged to be completed before the effective date of Hybrid III as the only dummy to be used in FMVSS 208. This would further increase the usefulness of one of our most important development tools. REFERENCES [1] NHTSA: Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 - Occupant Crash Protection.
