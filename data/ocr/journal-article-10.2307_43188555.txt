Yet, with few exceptions, Native artists are absent from most accounts of global contemporary art.3 In Mapping the Americas: The Transnational Politics of Contemporary Native Culture, Shari M. Huhndorf identifies a similar lack of attention to Native North American cultural studies in the larger project of "post- national" American studies. Huhndorf argues that this invisibility has the effect of "extending the colonial erasure of indigenous peoples" even as the historical experience of Native peoples of North America might otherwise be seen as a key example and implicit critique of imperialism.4 A possible explanation for this lack of visibility is the importance of a con- ception of sovereignty in the work of Native artists. While the work of many global contemporary artists engages issues of homeland, displacement, migration, and exile, the discourse of sovereignty as employed by Native North Americans is unique. Perhaps the most misunderstood notion in Native politics and culture generally, sovereignty in the context of Native people speaks to the claims to political autonomy of indigenous nations five centuries after the European con- quest and colonization of the Americas. This abiding autonomy is grounded in a specific, bounded place in which a people reside (or once resided) and which is the basis of a shared cultural inheritance. Native sovereignty has often been cast as a relationship to a territory or homeland, usually arrived at in primordial or legendary times after a protracted period of migration. Homeland is important, even for those peoples whose historical experience has been one of involuntary displacement and relocation; many nations experience emplacement in new lands even as they maintain profound attachments to other, ancestral places. The Salish-Kootenai artist Jaune Quick-to-See Smith writes, "Euro- Americans often wonder why the American Indian is so attached to the land. Even after Indians have lived in an urban environment for two generations, they still refer to tribal land as home. . . . Each tribe's total culture is immersed in its specific area. Tra- ditional foods, ceremonies, and art come from the indigenous plants and animals as well as the land itself. The anthropomorphism of the land spawns the stories and myths. These things are the stuff of culture which keep identity intact."5 Similarly, the Seneca-Tuscarora artist George Longfish has written of "landbase," which he defines as distinct from the European notion of landscape, which denotes "scenery," or sign of ownership and dominion. Longfish sees landbase as "the interwoven aspects of place, history, culture, physiology, a people and their sense of themselves and their spirituality and how the characteristics of the place are all part of the fabric.

These exhibitions included artworks varied in media and approach, produced by artists of diverse tribal backgrounds. Such diversity and variety notwithstanding, the organizers of the exhibitions argued that Native people as a group shared a common political situation: they live in a neocolonial relationship to the setder nations of Canada and the United States. Native conceptions of sovereignty are founded on an altogether different principle than obtains in the modern, European-derived sense of the nation-state. Native sovereignty and nationalist movements depend on an idea of a people or nationhood that is fundamentally spiritual, rather than legal and political. A founding figure in Native North American cultural studies, the Sioux theologian and legal scholar Vine Deloria Jr., writing with Clifford Lytle in their important 1984 book The NationsWithin:The Past and Future of American Indian Sovereignty, explained, "The idea of the people is primarily a religious conception, and with most Indian people it begins somewhere in the primordial mists."7 Native conceptions of sov- ereignty, however, while distinct from the modern European political tradition, have in the course of dealings with the setder nations taken on many aspects of the dominant model. As Deloria and Lytle wrote, "The idea of peoplehood, of nationality, has gradually been transformed over the past two centuries into a new idea, one derived primarily from the European heritage."8 Influenced by Deloria and Lytle, the Osage intellectual historian Robert Allen Warrior described sover- eignty as "a term from European theological and political discourse that finally does little to describe the visions and goals of American Indian communities that seek to retain a discrete identity."9 However, as Deloria and Lytle and Warrior demonstrate, the legal construct of sovereignty has been efficacious in contesting illegitimately imposed state authority over Native communities. Warrior con- cludes, "To simply abandon such terms, though, risks abandoning their abiding force and utility." 10 More recently the Kahnawake Mohawk political theorist Taiaiake Alfred, in his widely read book Peace, Power, Righteousness: An Indigenous Manifesto ( 1999) , has criticized the Native adoption of sovereignty as a political and legal construct. A veteran of the 1990 Mohawk uprising at Kanasetake (also known as Oka, Quebec, Canada) , Alfred describes sovereignty as "an inappropriate concept," arguing pro- vocatively that as an artifact of European jurisprudential tradition, sovereignty has no relevance to Native values and fails to fulfill Native spiritual needs. As little more than a zero-sum contest for power, the pursuit of sovereignty reduces Native politicians to mere opposite numbers to non-Native, neocolonial bureau- crats. Expedient yet deeply flawed as a model for Native community building, sovereignty is in Alfreds assessment ultimately self-defeating."

A better term, as Deloria and Lytle suggest, might be nationality or people- hood, although the term sovereignty retains its currency in recent theorizations of Native art and culture.12 The Tuscarora artist and critic Jolene Rickard was perhaps the earliest to employ the rhetoric of sovereignty in relation to contemporary art.13 Rickard has been clear, following the earlier work of Deloria and Lytle, Warrior, and Alfred, in arguing that the use of the discourse of sovereignty by Native people has been simultaneously an appropriation and a contestation of the European tradition of the term - an instrument wielded by Native communities in pursuit of "self- defined renewal and resistance." 14 As she writes, "The appropriation of a European notion of sovereignty was a strategy to resist the further dispossession of our land and resources. The idea that Indigenous communities would assert a call for nationhood in our own terms, not as domestic dependents as defined by the U.S. government, is at the center of the sovereignty debate." 's Significandy for the present study of contemporary art, Rickard tracks the shift away from territorial conceptions of sovereignty to an expanded understanding of the concept as a project of cultural, intellectual, and spiritual autonomy. Sovereignty as it appears in recent writings by Native artists and critics lies beyond the limited scope of the European-derived jurisprudential framework that gave the term its original meaning. In part, this shift away from territorial notions of sovereignty may reflect a sense that commitment to specific, bounded places is at odds with the contemporary realities of globalization, in which what Hannah Arendt termed the "national trinity" of "people-territory-state" has been in large part eroded by the tendency of late capitalism to dissolve nations as concrete entities.'6 However, Rickard cites Warriors concept of "intellectual sovereignty" (itself informed by Deloria) and the same term as employed by the Lenape Native studies scholar Joanne Barker, along with similar projects, as attempts to create "decolonized" methodologies - efforts to wrest disciplinary authority over Native histories, cultures, and identities away from colonial institutions and intellectual traditions.'7 Other recent uses of sovereignty in this expanded sense cited by Rickard include "artistic sovereignty" (Quick-to-See Smith) ; "cultural sovereignty" (the Tewa-Diné filmmaker Beverly Singer) ; and "visual sovereignty" (the Seminole-Muscogee-Diné photographer HulleahTsinhnahjinnie).'8 Follow- ing the arguments of Deloria and Lytle, Warrior, and Alfred, these expanded critical projects for Native sovereignty resonate deeply with Native conceptions of nationality and peoplehood that look back to a time and place before the imposition of the European legal and political tradition. They comprise a "shared ancient imaginary." 19 Moreover, Rickard argues that sovereignty - in an expanded, aesthetic sense - is obligatory for interpreting the work of contemporary Native artists: "Sovereignty could serve as an overarching concept for interpreting the intercon- nected space of the colonial gaze, deconstruction of the colonizing image or text, and Indigeneity." 20 Attention to this "emergent space," she writes, is a critical and theoretical imperative. Indeed, a more complete understanding of indigenous conceptions of sovereignty would help clarify the status of Native artists in the contemporary art world, which has been inattentive in large part to the perspec- tives on the experience of contemporaneity that indigenous artists - with their 12.

However, sovereignty as an abiding claim to autonomy - territorial, political, or aesthetic - remains mostly misunderstood by critics and audiences from out- side a narrow circle of those initiated into, committed to, or otherwise interested in Native North American cultural studies and contemporary art. While various recent critical projects have foregrounded sovereignty - and while Native critics have argued for the importance of decolonizing methodologies, grounded in local knowledge and Native epistemologies - as a critical, explanatory frame, sov- ereignty lacks currency in the contemporary art world. A Native understanding of sovereignty in the expanded field advocated by Rickard, I argue, is embodied in the work of Hock-E-Aye-Vi Edgar Heap of Birds (born 1954) . For over three decades, this artist has produced artworks in a variety of mediums - a body of work that not only comprises a trenchant and thoroughgoing critique of the loss of land and autonomy endured by Native North Americans under the heel of set- tler colonial expansionism, including his own Cheyenne and Arapaho Nation as well as other Native peoples, but also embodies a distincdy Native epistemology.21 This essay highlights three of Heap of Birds s major bodies of work: the Neuf series, an ongoing series of abstract paintings drawn from the experience of his reservation homeland in Oklahoma; Native Hosts, a likewise ongoing series of pub- lic artworks that engage local Native histories in varied locations; and Please the Waters, a 2009 public artwork in New York that narrates a human and environ- 21.

These three bodies of work will be interpreted in light of the role of land and environment in Heap of Birds s artistic practice, suggesting an understanding of sovereignty that can be illuminated by a reading of actor-network theory as it resonates with Native conceptions of place, culture, and identity. Actor-network theory posits a field of human and nonhuman interaction, in which agency is generally but evenly distributed, and in which human actors are entangled in collectives that include the nonhuman. As Bruno Latour writes, "Humans, for millions of years, have extended their social relations to other actants with which, with whom, they have swapped many properties, and with which, with whom, they form collectives."22 Actor-network theory, this essay will suggest, provides a framework for understanding Native conceptions of sover- eignty, not in the narrowly legalistic framework inherited from the European political tradition by way of the conquest and colonization of the Americas, but in keeping with Native epistemologies. Moreover, illuminated by actor-network theory, Heap of Birds s multifaceted work suggests an ethics, grounded in Native conceptions of sovereignty, yet fully appropriate to a globalized society. Many of Heap of Birds s works develop from his extensive historical research and recount in frank terms specific atrocities. Beginning with early works such as Death from the Top, a text-based installation from 1983, Heap of Birds s practice has embodied what Hal Foster terms the "archival impulse," through which "artists seek to make historical information, often lost or displaced, physically present . . . of Birds, "Life as Art: Creating through Acts of Personal and Cultural Renewal," in [Rejinventing the Wheel: Advancing the Dialogue on Contemporary American Indian Art, ed.

The artist poses with his work. in a gesture of alternative knowledge or counter-memory."23 The text for Death from the Top highlights an exemplary countermemory of the Native experience of American Manifest Destiny, drawing from the recollections of a survivor of the 1868 Washita Massacre, a formative event for the Southern Cheyenne, in which tribal leader Black Kettle and his wife, along with over one hundred warriors and an unknown number of women and children, were killed by United States troops. Other works level a more generalized critique of the costs of expansionist military and economic agendas in a more personal, stream-of-consciousness, diaristic language and visual style - an analogue of the artist s own embodied alternative knowledge: American Policy, a series of text drawings begun in 1986, compares the global reach of the US military to a history of domestic repression and violence against Native peoples. Heap of Birds also asserted Native alternative knowledge and countermem- ory with Wheel, a permanent outdoor sculpture installed at the Denver Art Museum in 2005. An arrangement of ten vertical forms in red porcelain enamel over steel frames - each twelve feet tall and notched at the top in aY-form, resembling a forked tree trunk - marks the contour of a circle forty-eight feet in diameter. The shape of the sculpture recalls a traditional Plains Earth Renewal (or Sun Dance) lodge - resonating with Heap of Birds s long-term participation in 23. Hal Foster, "An Archival Impulse," October 110 (Fall 2004): 4. 64 FALL 2012</page><page sequence="8">this important ceremony. The vertical elements, however, also read in a more abstract register. Towering high above a viewer's head, they are powerful visual metaphors for the resourcefulness and tenacity - what the Ojibwe writer and critic Gerald Vizenor terms "survivance" - of indigenous cultures.24 In designing Wheel, Heap of Birds drew inspiration from the forked branches he saw used in simple shelters and as makeshift supports for cooking pots. They suggest impro- vised yet sturdy structures in the landscape - they might carry the weight of a horizontal roof beam. Heap of Birds described the form as "symbolic of our inherent strength."25 In handwritten texts and symbols transferred to the surface of the ten lodge-post forms, Heap of Birds recounts a history of US-Indian policy and memorializes the 1864 massacre by a territorial militia under the command of US Army Colonel John Chivington of four hundred Cheyenne and Arapaho people encamped under a US flag at Sand Creek, Colorado. Heap of Birds s artworks have become iconic examples of a critical contemporary Native art. With their mixture of economy and pathos, such works offer an indictment of the legacies of con- quest and an affirmation of the ongoing Native struggle for sovereignty. A recent temporary public artwork by Heap of Birds, Please the Waters, installed from August 1 to November 29, 2009, at Wave Hill, in the Bronx, New York, com- plicates a reading of the artist s work solely as a countermemory of conquest. Wave Hill is a contemporary-art center and public garden on twenty-eight acres overlooking the Hudson River and the cliffs of the Palisades. In Please the Waters, Heap of Birds narrates a history of the Hudson River Valley in the four hundred years since Henry Hudson, in the employ of the Dutch East India Company, navi- gated the waterway in search of the fabled Northwest Passage to the Far East.26 As Foster notes of the archival impulse, "Artists are often drawn to unfulfilled begin- nings or incomplete projects . . . that might offer points of departure again."27 Please the Waters presents just such a return to an unfulfilled beginning with rel- evance for a renewed future, and provides a basis for revisiting some earlier, serial works from Heap of Birds s career - the abstract Neuf paintings and Native Hosts public interventions. In these works, land (as nation or home place) emerges as a key term in the artist's ongoing practice. As Heap of Birds noted in a 2004 interview with the critical legal geographer Nick Blomley, The land is the beginning and the end. It is to humble yourself and know that the land and earth comes first before the people: somewhat like caring for the children first because they are precious, although we are not parents of the land. . . . [A] s someone grows to know certain sites on this earth then it can cradle you, reaffirm you, and offer you a relationship. Also the earth remains after you are gone and was here before one's distant relatives. The earth also is an instrument giving the necessary tools and plants in order to create ceremony.28 Here, Heap of Birds explains that land makes possible ceremony - the foundation of identity. But Heap of Birds also emphasizes that land "comes first before the people," and "remains after you are gone." Land, in this formulation, exceeds human history.

The princi- pal theme of the exhibition was the significance of the river for Native peoples. In using a Native word for the river in the title and including Native artists among the thirteen featured artists from Mexico, the United States, and Canada, the exhibition was notable in foregrounding Native issues.29 The waterway was used by the Lenape (or Delaware Indians) , who traditionally occupied lands between the Delaware River and the Lower Hudson River - encompassing present-day New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, northern Delaware, and southeastern New York State - before their displacement by Iroquoian rivals and encroaching white set- tlers in the nineteenth century. In Lenape, the Muhheakantuck is the "river that flows two ways," as the Hudson is in fact a salty, tidal estuary, in which currents move north as far as the city of Troy, New York, and south toward New York Bay and the open waters of the Atlantic. Each sign, in shades of blue, and bordered by a pattern of animal, chemical, technological, or financial symbols, begins with the phrase "MUHHEAKANTUCK KNOWS," followed by a terse, three-line phrase relating a human and natural history of the Lower Hudson.30 A sign reading "MUHHEAKANTUCK KNOWS / SALT TIDES / WINDS / SEA" is dated "CIRCA 4000 BC," suggesting a primeval blank slate when the region and the waterway were formed by the watershed and the moon's gravitational influence on the waters of the Atlantic. Heap of Birds explained that the watershed has also been home to a chang- ing and often conflictual community of human and nonhuman denizens. Following chronologically, viewers read that "CIRCA 800," the Lower Hudson hosts a dense population of fauna: "MUHHEAKANTUCK KNOWS / BEAR HAWK HERON / BEAVER EEL DEER / TURTLE SNIPE WOLF." By "CIRCA 200£," the region s population of animal inhabitants includes "HUDSON SHAD OSPREY / STRIPED BASS / BALD EAGLE / ATLANTIC STURGEON." Humans and cultural conflict mark the region by "CIRCA 1609," the year of Hudson's first voyage. Representing this juncture, Heap of Birds created two signs: "MUHHEAKANTUCK KNOWS / DUTCH / EAST INDIA / COMPANY" and "MUHHEAKANTUCK KNOWS / ENGLISHMAN / JOHN COLEMAN / ARROW IN THROAT," narrating the killing of a Hudson's Bay Company captain. Human habitation has debased the watershed by "CIRCA i960," as toxic chemical compounds released into the ecosystem by industry turned the region into a federal Superfund site: "MUH- HEAKANTUCK KNOWS / DIOXIN / POLYCHLORINATED / BIPHENYL"; "MUH- HEAKANTUCK KNOWS / FURANS / POLYCYLIC AROMATIC / HYDROCARBONS." However, by "CIRCA 2009," as the exhibition opened in the quadricentennial year of Hudson's first voyage, the river is witnessing the beginnings of an ongo- ing restoration, as well as an event that Heap of Birds interprets as the natural world asserting its power over human technology - "MUHHEAKANTUCK KNOWS / LGA AIRBUS A-320 / US AIR / 1^49. "This refers to the well- known story of a passenger jetliner en route from New York's La Guardia Airport to Charlotte that was struck by a flock of Canada geese minutes after takeoff and that ditched in the river near midtown Manhattan on January 15, 2009. Heap of Birds has described the incident as "the birds asking the plane to land," which, due to calm waters, was brought down without human injuries.31 A favorable notice in the New York Times praised Heap of Birds 's signs, which, the reviewer wrote, "remind us of a vanished indigenous past, but also that the Edgar Heap of Birds, Please the Waters (detail), 2009, 8 steel signs, ea. 24 x 36 in.

Collectively, as the cura- tor Jennifer McGregor wrote, the artworks in the exhibition explored "the significance of the waterway to Indigenous peoples before and after Hudson's arrival." The river "provided both a connective route for the Indigenous people and a conduit for launching European trade and expan- sion beyond the region, ultimately impacting the entire continent." McGregor, The Muhheakantuck in Focus, exh. broch. (Bronx: Wave Hill Glyndor Gallery, 2009). An interesting comparison is the 2004 exhibition Watershed : The Hudson Valley Art Project, mounted by Minetta Brook, a New York arts organization, which did not include indigenous artists, although many of the featured artworks did address issues of local indigenous peoples, cultures, and histories. 30. The borders included images of biological mutation, currency symbols ($, /) eagle and fish forms, abstract images of waves, bear claws, gas mask-respirators, arrowheads, birds, and air- planes. Heap of Birds explains that the choice of the color blue (his customary color for public sig- nage has been red) was a tribute to his youngest son, Wougim - whose Cheyenne name translates as "Blue Sky Man." 31.

First, rather than focusing on a vanished past, Heap of Birds s signs, like all of the artist s text-based work, make use exclusively of the present tense. Moreover, only one of eight panels makes explicit reference to the Native human inhabitants of the region - the Lenape - who might be credited with shooting an arrow into the throat of an English interloper in 1609. Second, the notion of the Lower Hudson as an "ecosystem that required constant stewardship and care," in addition to recycling stereotypes of Native peoples as natural environmentalists - "stewards" - fails to recognize what Muhheakantuck knows - that the region is a vital network of human and nonhuman, organic and inorganic actors, any of which may at one moment be ascendant, but none of which can claim dominion. The river knows that an ecosytem is not static. The river knows that the Lenape and their Dutch partners depleted the region's population of beaver and other fur-bearing mam- mals by the middle of the seventeenth century. The river knows the destruction wrought by manufacturing in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. If Heap of Birds took Wave Hill's brief - that his artwork place "in focus" the significance of the river for its Native human neighbors across four turbulent centuries - he also expanded that brief to describe a landscape dense with human and nonhuman 32. Benjamin Genocchio. "The River's Meaning to Indians, Before and After Hudson," New York Times , September 6, 2009, WE10. 68 FALL 2012</page><page sequence="12">histories. Please the Waters is concerned not only with the region's native peoples, but also with the landscape itself, before and after the catastrophe of discovery and colonization. The river also knows that birds can bring down planes. The technical term for the incident that befell US Air flight 1549 is a "bird strike" - a phrase that would seem to assign agency to the birds rather than the more powerful and deadly aircraft with which they have become mixed up, but which nevertheless they have brought down in a postmodern media event. Indeed, the animals (and chemical compounds) listed on Heap of Birds s signs are forces with agency in their own right. The bear, hawk, heron, beaver, eel, deer, turtle, snipe, wolf, Hudson shad, osprey, striped bass, bald eagle, Adantic sturgeon, and sundry industrial byproducts have shaped the region as much as the human actors and corporate protagonists that figure on just two panels. Heap of Birds refers to his animal actors as "clan mothers," citing a powerful linkage to human identities as well. The signs document the intertwined histories of the human and non- human - and organic and inorganic - forces of agency in the landscape. But Muhheakantuck itself "knows." The river, in Heap of Birds s telegraphic narrative, is possessed of awareness - attention and intention - a mind. Since the early 1980s, Heap of Birds has produced abstract paintings, and 69 artjournal</page><page sequence="13">I would like to shift focus to those paintings. To this ongoing and open-ended series he has given the name Neuf - the Cheyenne word for the number four. Neuf is a key concept in Cheyenne culture relating to the four sacred colors, or the four directions, and to the process in which a ritual is performed four times - as in the commitment made to undertake the Earth Renewal ceremony for a cycle last- ing four years. Heap of Birds has been an Earth Renewal participant since return- ing to Cheyenne -Arapaho territory in the early 1980s. In the summer of 2010 he completed his fourth cycle of four years, earning his fourth "paint," a sequence of body adornment in which the dancer embodies an animal spirit or totem over the course of the ceremony. Heap of Birds made the first Neuf painting around the time that he became an Earth Renewal participant, as he moved to the reservation to live in his grandmother s cabin on the family property near Geary, in western Oklahoma, which he has called "the old home-place."33 The first Neuf painting was small and completed out of doors - quickly and spontaneously - in acrylic paints on canvas board. Interlocking impasto forms in white, black, and gray play against shapes in shades of green, salmon, and earth tones - a field of related but discrete bodies in which no individual predomi- nates, and which suggests extension beyond the edge of the canvas. While it is, to be sure, an abstract painting, Heap of Birds has described it as his response to the rugged canyon that he was coming to know as he lived on the land, taking daily hikes and hunting with his dogs to make a living and find his way as an artist. For Heap of Birds, the series had a beginning that was insistently local. "I was out in the canyon where my grandmother had built a house," he explains, "about 500 acres of land, and I went hiking and walking a lot. . . . There was one lone cedar that came up out of an outcropping of rocks where you'd think noth- ing could survive. I went back out there and took a small £ -by- 8 -inch canvas and went down into the canyon and made the first Neuf painting. ... It took me six years to realize I was painting this tree." 34 The recurring shapes draw from the landscape, but also Heap of Birds s sense of its vital energy: "Events such as water rushing after a storm, cutting the red rock, giving new form to the red earth [which] add a natural energy to my painting, while connecting my work with a visible reality."35 While the first painting was made of soft, cloud-like shapes, in later paintings the forms take on jagged edges, similar to the scrub pines that grow on the land, a comparison that Heap Birds emphasizes in lectures, when he shows a slide of such a tree - a juniper - turned on its side, its serrated outline looking very much like the forms in the paintings. Indeed, for anyone who has experienced firsthand the formidable landscape of the reservation, the Neuf paint- ings will recall the rugged beauty of that landscape. The Neuf paintings, however, are unconventional landscapes. Their bold abstraction aside, what distinguishes them from the European tradition of the landscape as it has evolved since the seventeenth century is the absence of a hor- izon. The horizon line, which figures so prominently in landscape paintings, might as well stand in here for rationalized system of perspectivai rendering that creates the illusion of a view into deep space. The horizon - the point where land meets sky - is the limit of our vision in a landscape painting. It corresponds to the eye -level view of the perceiving subject - the viewer of the painting, who occupies, at least in theory, the same vantage point as the painter, or the imagined individual whose gaze we momentarily inhabit when we look on the painting. 33.

Scholars in recent years have argued that the techniques of perspective encode an ideology of dominion over the landscape and those that inhabit it. The limit of our vision corresponds to the limit of our domain. Perspective, it is argued, creates a distinction between surveyor and surveyed - between subject and object - a "gaze" that distances and objectifies, enabling policies of colonial expropriation, territorial expansionism, and wanton environmental devastation. It would take much more space to flesh out this argument, but suffice to say, the modern, Euro-American acquisitive individual, the argument goes, is constructed by this panoramic view, a Foucauldian "eye of power" that visualizes a fantasy of mastery. Malcolm Andrews, in his history of landscape in Western art, writes that such paintings offered a unique combination of "information and invitation."36 Indeed, art historians have argued for the close connection between the develop- ment of landscape as a genre in early modern Europe and the project of colonial- ism.37 The geographer Jay Appleton has sought to naturalize such a notion with his "habitat theory," which argues that the aesthetic pleasure we take in a land- scape painting derives from "atavistic modes of valuing territorial advantage that were almost instinctive to hunter-gatherer societies. The strategic importance of seeing the hunter s prey or hostile forces without being seen oneself translates naturally into a sense of greater security. Land forms that offer images of prospect and refuge, therefore, satisfy ancient survival needs that are buried deep in the human psyche. An appealing landscape is a single view of aptly disposed prospect-refuge opportunities." 38 It is significant to note, as Heap of Birds mentioned in a 1992 interview, that his grandmother s cabin does indeed enjoy such a commanding view. "As you saw from the top of our place here," Heap of Birds recounted to Larry Abbott, "you 36. Malcolm Andrews, Landscape and Western Art (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1999), 77. 37.

Jay Appleton, The Experience of Landscape (London: John Wiley, 1975), quoted in Andrews, 18. Appleton links these features to the "visual field of violence . . . hunting, war, surveillance." To be clear, Appleton's theory needs to be unpacked and historicized. Mitchell notes that there exist other, nonmasculine, nonviolent, positions: "woman, gatherer, scientist, poet, interpreter, or tourist." See Mitchell, "Imperial Landscape," in Landscape and Power, 16. 71 artjournal</page><page sequence="15">can see twenty or thirty miles in every direction." 39 Yet, for the Neuf paintings, the view that Heap of Birds has sought is from down in the canyon, with the horizon pushed out of frame - not a "sovereign gaze" that surveys the landscape like a predator, but the view of an inhabitant of that landscape. In a sense, as the hori- zon line disappears, so does the perceiving subject. Not separate from the land- scape, the subject is part of a larger collective of human and nonhuman actors. This observation corresponds with recent writings in the "posthumanities" in which the human subject is decentered from its customary position of privi- lege vis-à-vis the natural, the animal, and the nonhuman. In particular, Please the Waters and the Neuf series resonate with actor-network theory, originally developed by Michel Callón and Latour in their studies of the role of interdependent struc- tures, or material-semiotic networks - technical and intellectual - in which scientific achievement and innovation occur. As developed by Callón and Latour, actor-network theory considers aspects of background, such as technologies, systems of rules, social systems, and so forth, as objects of analysis in their own right, assigning agency to the nonhuman entities in the network. Actor-network theory has been borrowed and developed by other fields, including history, femi- nist theory, and ecocriticism, which is particularly relevant to the present discus- sion. Ecocritical readings of actor-network theory, such as the "political ecology" of Jane Bennett, posit a vital field, wherein agency - what Bennett describes as the power to move other affective bodies - is distributed unevenly among human and nonhuman elements.40 Following actor-network theory in reading the landscape as a vital collective, in turn, is helpful in understanding sovereignty from a Native, rather than Eurocentric, perspective. In a recent essay describing practices of visual sover- eignty, the Seneca scholar of Native literature and film Michelle Rahe ja writes, "Native nations prior to European contact theorized about the concept of sover- eignty in order to discursively distinguish themselves from the other human, spirit, animal, and inanimate communities surrounding them through perfor- mance, songs, stories, dreams, and visual texts such as wampum, pictographs, and tipi drawings."41 Here, Raheja invokes a tradition of imagining the indigenous nation that predates the imposition of the European jurisprudence. For Raheja, sovereignty (following Deloria and Lytle, a better word to capture this sense might be "peoplehood") is asserted by a human population across and against a field or network of human and nonhuman relationships - from which a nation and an identity are forged. This reading resonates with the idea that most Native people s names for themselves translate as "the people," or "the real people." As Deloria and Lytle write, "Tribal names generally reflect the basic idea that these particular people have been chosen from among the various peoples of the universe - including mammals, birds, and reptiles, as well as other humans - to hold a special relationship with the higher powers."42 We may see this sense of the interrelation between human and nonhuman as embodied in the permeabil- ity between human and nonhuman realms that is an important part of many Native worldviews - for example, the nonhuman or "shape-shifting" supernatu- ral personages that figure in many Native spiritual practices and stories of origin. Further, we might see resonances with Bennett, when she writes that while "envi- ronmentalists are selves who live on earth, vital materialists are selves who live as earth," or with Latour, who imagined a possible politics as a "parliament of 39.

The landscape is not a thing out there, but a continuous field alive with energy of which the artist is part. There are no edges, no sure footing, no borders. Nevertheless, we will see that Heap of Birds s vision is very much committed to the idea of a bounded, specific space of the family allotment, the reservation, or the tribal nation, which coheres and abides despite the exigencies of history - human and nonhuman - even though it has been uprooted and displaced. Indeed, for an artist so well known for his neoconceptual, text-based, and often critical political artworks, it is striking that Heap of Birds has so regularly pur- sued abstract painting drawn from the experience of landscape. Perhaps because of this fact, some critics have interpreted the Neuf series as embodying the artist's commitment to a concept of place that is at odds with the contemporary experi- ence of globalization. They see the Neuf paintings as central to understanding the artist s commitment to tradition and emplacement - to being rooted in a spe- cific, bounded homeland. The art historian Charlotte Townsend-Gault, for exam- ple, argues that there is "a certain logic to the repetition of the Neuf sequence. There are fixed places, there are great certainties, everything is not relative."44 Moreover, this sense of being grounded in a fixed place is seen as central to a project that critics have termed "defending the homeland" and "picturing sovereignty," which they argue characterizes Heap of Birds s artistic practice more generally.45 However, such readings elide (or perhaps merely fail to recognize) the degree to which the Neuf series has developed into a much more flexible artistic syntax that enables Heap of Birds s increasingly global practice. The artist has con- tinued to make Neuf paintings for over three decades. The paintings have become larger - and perhaps more schematic - as Heap of Birds transforms his initial response to the "old home place" into a repeatable pattern that can be picked up again and again, as an autonomous studio practice, regardless of the artist's loca- tion. He has produced Neuf paintings "for Arizona" and "for Maine," as well as "for Oklahoma," and in such far-flung sites as Australia. Far from grounding the artist, the Neuf series has become a language of shapes that suggest the inter- changeability of places and attachments as much as their distinctiveness - a sign of the artist's itinerancy as much as his rootedness. Heap of Birds explains that the Neuf paintings can be made anywhere. Only the first was painted en plein air - on site. The rest have been painted from memory in the studio, drawn from the first. In a sense, we might see them as portable homelands, a sign for the artist's embodied perception wherever he might be. Interestingly, Heap of Birds is willing to have the forms read differendy for varying audiences - as trees, leaves, clouds, or other forms. After a 1994 residency project in Australia, during which time he snorkeled on the Great Barrier Reef, Heap of Birds began comparing the forms to the bodies of brighdy colored tropi- cal fish. The forms are mobile and adaptable. They have also appeared, translated and reimagined, on new surfaces and objects. In 1992 with the Fabric Workshop in Philadelphia, Heap of Birds produced a suite of printed silk scarves featuring the Neuf shapes. For a 2007 glass project in Murano, coordinated with his appear- ance at the Venice Biennale, Heap of Birds reinterpreted the Neuf shape as a human figure - the bodies of Native performers who died while traveling in Europe with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. These translations are also significant 43. Bennett, 111; Latour quoted in Bennett, 104. 44.

(78.7 cm) (artwork © Edgar Heap of Birds) in that they transform the Neuf shapes into tactile experiences - scarves that can be worn, vases than can be handled. A visual experience becomes physical. Heap of Birds s own embodied perception of the landscape can, in some fashion, become entangled with our own. Notably, Heap of Birds considers the shape to be an optimistic and life-affirming symbol. As he explained, "These . . . painted works seek to project the understanding that the world, as witnessed from the sage, cedar, and red canyon, is a lively and replenishing place."46 Thus, if the Neuf landscapes are an expression of being in, with, and of nature, it makes sense that the shapes can also become tropical fish, among which one swims, and with whom one shares an ocean and an environment. They are optimistic and life affirming, even as they become human bodies in the Venice glassworks, fallen, returning to the earth. They are figures for an idea that self, other, and nature might be mutable, interchangeable, and relational, or even share an identity at some deep level. The perspective offered by Please the Waters and the Neuf series enables a recon- sideration of what is arguably Heap of Birds s best-known work - the ongoing series of temporary public signage known as Native Hosts. In 1988, commissioned by the Public Art Fund, Heap of Birds created the first works in the series Native Hosts, a suite of six signs for City Hall Park in lower Manhattan (each commer- cially printed on aluminum in a standard size, as in numerous later works, including Please the Waters). Droll yet pointed interventions in the public park, the signs greeted passersby with the phrase "NEW YORK [in reversed text]/ TODAY YOUR HOST IS SENECA," or one of five other tribes with traditional ties to the land that is now the greater New York area: Shinnecock, Cayuga, Montauk, Mohawk, and Oneida.47 Since 1988, versions of the work tailored to the local history have been installed in Vancouver (1991 and 2007), Buffalo (1996-98), Norman, Oklahoma (2000), Portland, Oregon (2002), Champaign-Urbana, Illinois (under the title Beyond the Chief, in reference to a recent decision by the 46. Heap of Birds quoted in Land Spirit Power, 149. 47. Heap of Birds's initial proposal had included twelve signs, but the installation was limited to six by the mayor's office.

As the critic Jean Fisher writes, the series "lays bare the problem of language: the vehicle through which the history and culture of his people were disavowed and redefined. ... If the law dispossessed the people of their homelands, language continues to disinherit the Native American from the right to speak in her or his own name. Language most clearly demonstrates the unbridgeable distance that exists between Anglo and Indian perceptions of the world."49 But as Fisher notes, the signs bring together in one space dominant and Native languages. This tactic forces "a confrontation between what are essentially mutually unintelligible words."50 Also significant, the colonial names of familiar places are reversed. In doing so, Heap-of-Birds s public installations defamiliarize the local setting and inform viewers of the nations that once held aboriginal sov- ereignty over these lands. As the critic Robert L. Pincus writes, text reversal is "a tidy visual metaphor for the great divide between American Indian history and general American history Hold the sign up to a mirror and New York would read correcdy and everything else would be backward. It's as if Heap of Birds is using 48. To date, the only permanent installation is in Vancouver, on the campus of the University of British Columbia in 2007. 49. Jean Fisher, New York, Today Your Host Is Shinnecock," in Hachivi Edgar Heap of Birds: Claim Your Color, 18. 50. Ibid. 75 artjournal</page><page sequence="19">English while reminding us it never fully defines his world."5' Thus, the reversal of place names signals a historical perspective - a looking back - as well as a metaphor for embodied knowledges at mutually incomprehensible cross-purposes. Native names are never reversed and always appear in an insistent, declarative, present-tense sentence: "Today your host is . . ." The series also engages with specific places and histories and in this regard might be seen as further evidence of Heap of Birds s affinity with the archival impulse. Moreover, locations and the names of tribal "hosts" are chosen in col- laboration with local stakeholders (Native communities, and in the case of Beyond the Chief in Champaign-Urbana, the various ethnic-studies programs and minority student organizations that cosponsored the project) , as are the names used to address non-Native viewers ("New York" in City Hall Park; "Fighting Illini" at the University of Illinois) . The basis of each installation design - Heap of Birds s research into local history and work with local collaborators - locates the series in a history of site-specific artworks, as well as with a drive to foreground alter- native knowledge and countermemory. In the terms of Miwon Kwon s genealogy of site-specificity, Native Hosts is "site-oriented" in that it engages issues outside art s conventional institutional spaces; the content of the work merges with the physical site itself and its diverse histories, revealing histories that have been obscured by official public narratives.52 In New York, Native Hosts was placed near and in dialogue with a monument to Horace Greeley, the founder of the New York Tribune and author of the famous slogan of US territorial expansionism and Manifest Destiny: "Go West." This deliberate placement encouraged viewers to think about the complex history of a shared space; in this way, Native Hosts is also exemplary of what the artist Suzanne Lacy has termed "new genre public art," a movement that might best be described as a social interventionist practice, in which artists use varied forms to engage diverse audiences about the meaning and function of shared spaces, and the often-turbulent histories of those spaces, as well as the notion of the public itself.53 To be sure, Native Hosts operates by revealing hidden histories of displace- ment - of ongoing claims to territory, of sovereignty lost, stolen, reclaimed, and regained, and of the traumatic relationship of Native peoples to land in North America.54 What has remained unremarked, however, is that these works have also modeled a protocol, a form of diplomacy, and an appropriate way of being a visitor in a foreign territory. They represent a Native perspective, which sees rela- tions between peoples as relations between sovereign equals - whether as allies or enemies - by acknowledging those with a claim to a particular place in their language, and in the name they give themselves. In these works, then, Heap of Birds is modeling a kind of ethics, such as that invoked by the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah s recent attempt to revitalize a notion of cosmopolitan- ism, which he defines as an "ethics in a world of strangers."55 Appiah avers that this notion demands that we recognize "obligations to others [that] stretch beyond those to whom we are related by ties of kith and kind, or even the more formal ties of a shared citizenship."56 But, as we might ask with Heap of Birds in light of Please the Waters and the Neuf series, what if our notion of a global ethics was extended to the nonhuman, to what the ecological writer Timothy Morton, in a posthumanist mode, refers to as "strange strangers"?57 In the works highlighted above, Heap of Birds suggests a way of thinking 51.

The English word "host" in the work's title has two Latin roots. It can denote one receiving or entertaining guests, in which case it derives from hospes, a word that refers both to one who receives strangers and one who is a stranger seeking recognition, and that evokes the many complexities of reciprocal obligations. The English word "hospitality" comes from this root. It can also refer to a large group or a multitude, as in a group of soldiers or angels, a meaning derived from hostis, meaning enemy. The English word "hostile" derives from this root. Thanks to Stephen Glass for unpacking this etymology. 55. Cosmopolitanism has recently been highlighted as a characteristic of a multicentered history of modern and contemporary art.

Significantly, Heap of Birds has produced versions of Native Hosts in numerous locations. If in his Neuf paintings he is grounded in the home he has made, with Native Hosts Heap of Birds is a visitor, paying proper respects in a foreign territory, attentive to the proper protocols involved in being a guest on another's territory. These works are made from the perspective of an alien, an outsider, and a visitor, who nevertheless models appropriate discourse, behavior, and respect for the "hosts." In Please the Waters, humans share a vital network with other actors. Indeed, the names that Heap of Birds features in Native Hosts are the names that Deloria and Lytle translate as "the people." They are the names of human communities that find their place and their home within a field of human and nonhuman interaction - the names that Native communities traditionally used to define themselves within and against a vital environment, and which gave form to their relationship with the natural and supernatural worlds. Heap of Birds s work addresses this point. "I have always remarked that we should not always focus only upon the more trivial relationship of Indians against some figure like president Bush or Custer," he writes. "While this violence has been deadly, the dominant culture actually wishes it that way, keeping them in the picture, making the argument about them, from their power position. To open the discussion up to include the Milky Way Galaxy is much more real to our Native understanding."58 Heap of Birds s disciplined and insightful body of artwork - drawings and abstract paintings, as well as text-based public art - teaches us to think about sovereignty, nation, and human identity against a field of human-nonhuman, organic-inorganic networks and collectives. This idea is perhaps more in keeping with Native epistemologies of place and power than a notion of sovereignty in a purely jurisprudential sense. A Native theory of land and peoplehood is a way of thinking about nation and identity beyond the zero- sum game of politics in the setder nation.
