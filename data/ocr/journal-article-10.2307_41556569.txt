<plain_text><page sequence="1">Maverick voices: the novels of David Foster and Robin Wallace-Crabbe A. P. RIEMER By and large, the temper of contemporary Australian fiction is serious, morally and politically responsible and almost always polite. Its horizons are generally determined by middle-class values of the sort that one may encounter at dinner parties in Balmain and Carlton. Writers have shunned, on the whole, the earlier, much more robust traditions of Australian culture. Most seem to shy away from that raucous and at times eccentric and colourful (if not always cultivated) nonconformism that formerly characterised Australian national life. Two novelists have nevertheless gone some way towards resurrecting the larrikin tradition which gave nineteenth- and early- twentieth-century Australian culture a measure of individuality. Moreover, the work of both reveals- surprisingly perhaps- that the vulgar irreverence often associated in several parts of the world with typically Australian characteristics is a means of enriching their writing with considerable intellectual strength. Neither fits comfortably into the prevailing patterns of contemporary literarary culture; neither has discovered the critical esteem or commercial success the quality of their fiction would seem to warrant. Each is perhaps too individual, too much a maverick, to find ready acceptance within the institutional and corporate structures that sustain contemporary literary life. It is significant, perhaps, that neither has emerged from an academic or educational environment- especially in the humanit- ies-which is the customary nurturing-place of modern Australian writers. One, at least, maintains his 'other life' while continuing to explore the writer's craft. Robin Wallace-Crabbe was born in 1938. During the 1960s he was better known as a painter than as a writer; he has persisted with his career in the visual arts alongside his writing, which is itself divided between two distinct areas. Under his own name he has published three freewheeling, at times decidedly eccentric novels which examine, often by way of raucous parodies of the less refined aspects of Aus- tralian society, the predicament of contemporary life. As Robert Wallace, Wallace- Crabbe has written a series of successful thrillers, where, within the traditions of such novels, the preoccupations of his more conventional fiction are transformed without, however, sustaining a loss of individuality. David Foster was born in 1944. His formal training was in science; consequently some of his early fiction betrays the influence of his scientific education, though his writing career has taken him well beyond such confines. In a manner similar to Wallace-Crabbe, but perhaps with greater consistency, Foster has incorporated some of the least cultivated aspects of Australian life in novels which attempt to find a local habitation and a name for remarkably 'high culture' concerns. He has written Â© CS 1994</page><page sequence="2">126 Critical Survey, volume 6, number 1 a highly idiosyncratic version of the story of Faust in Plumbum (with a glance, per- haps, at Thomas Mann) where he employs a group of spaced-out heavy-metal rock musicians as a corporate embodiment of the alchemist of Wittenberg. In The Adven- tures of Christian Rosy Cross, that seventeenth-century cult-figure is transformed into a 'laid-back' incarnation of the inarticulate drug generation of the sixties. Dog Rock, set in the southern highlands of New South Wales, relies to some extent on Virgil's Georgics. His most recent (and in many ways finest) work, Mates of Mars, an extra- ordinary fable of spiritual and intellectual decline, engages with varieties of Asian martial arts, but it also resounds with memories of Tacitus. Wallace-Crabbe's fiction- whether published under his own name or as the work of Robert Wallace- is less clearly discernible as an attempt to endow the concerns and preoccupations of what may be regarded as conventional European culture with a recognisably Australian accent. There is nevertheless evidence in some of his work of concerns remarkably similar to Foster's. Each writer is clearly preoccupied by ambivalent attitudes or prejudices which reflect, in all probability, their recognition of a rift between their inclinations and predisposition- towards the urbane literary culture of the 'old world' (at least as far as it is perceived from an Australian perspective)- and the social, cultural and political characteristics of Australian life in the second half of the twentieth century. Both may be described as conservative radicals- and therefore not entirely congenial to the predominant political flavour of contemporary literary life- who look with equal dismay at the vulgarity of modern Australia and at the smug hypocrisy of the 'old world', the origin of many of their cultural standards and preoccupations. The result in each instance is, therefore, a tendency towards producing wild, freewheeling works of fiction, filled with bleak and despairing satire. No doubt fortuitously, but by no means without considerable significance, some of the finest work of both Wallace-Crabbe and Foster is to be found in two eccentric fables which purport to tell the history of Australia, or in Foster's case of a place which is an infernal emblem or 'type' of that continent and its people. Both works are disturbing, complex and idiosyncratic. Each violates the prevailing conventions of contemporary Australian fiction, and each discovers considerable satiric and ima- ginative strength in revisionist versions of history told by maverick voices resonant with the accents of demotic Australia. Foster's Moonlite (its title echoes the name of a notorious bushranger of the nineteenth century) was published in 1981. Like Wallace-Crabbe's somewhat more genial Australia Australia of 1989, Moonlite begins in the north of the British Isles, among seemingly stone-age inhabitants of a wind- swept island who fall subject to the more 'civilised', that is to say more brutally exploitative, Sassenachs. This complicated and convoluted tale- recounted in an unflaggingly energetic but entirely deadpan manner- concerns the adventures of Finbar MacDuffie, an albino offspring of that near-barbaric community. The early chapters are largely taken up with a virtuoso evocation of their way of life: near- nomads, they live in makeshift dwellings and spend their entire lives within the complex rituals of hunting the guga, the sea-bird which is their sole source of food</page><page sequence="3">Maverick voices: the novels of David Foster and Robin Wallace-Crabbe 127 and fuel. Australia Australia begins in a similarly isolated setting- though in this case the historical period, the eighteenth century, is much more firmly established. In both novels, these isolated communities are gradually invaded by the 'civilised' world; in Moonlite by missionaries, social reformers and the curious; in Wallace-Crabbe's off-beat version of history by the hangers-on of the Hanoverian monarch, King George. Finbar, the albino who is believed to have been touched by the Sidhe, leaves his neolithic Eden; Foster's novel consequently assumes something of the character of Candide in its po-faced account of Finbar's experience of the nastiness of the world, which is told with a terse, colloquial conciseness. Finbar's adventures take him through time from the neanderthal world of his tribe to an England of the nineteenth century, where he is temporarily seduced by the great dream of the age: the absolute, undisputed validity of scientific inquiry. But, as with Johnson's Rasselas (another questing character adrift in a confusing world), his adventures end where they began- not literally, for Finbar's career comes to a culmination at the polar opposite or mirror-image of the world of his origins: the colony of New West Highlands, peopled by an equally aboriginal community of hunter-gatherers- and also by assor- ted gold-seeking riff-raff. Yet Foster's strategies in Moonlite insist that Finbar's jour- ney brings him to a world indistinguishable from that in which it began. As Moonlite, the initiate and creature of the Rainbow Fella (an ambiguous local deity), Finbar enters into his inheritance as surely as this Sidhe-touched albino would have done on his native island. Moonlite, like most of Foster's work, is informed by anger and despair. Some of his later novels may be more genial than this grim account of degeneracy and dispossession, yet those too look at the modern Australian psyche with jaundiced eyes. The 'New South Highlands' are filled with bovine or ape-like creatures, des- cendants of Swift's yahoos. Their 'betters', the strutting flowers of European 'civilis- ation', are no less barbaric, distinguished only by their cant and hypocrisy. In Moon- lite, as elsewhere in Foster's fiction, the original inhabitants of the Australian continent are seen as having been dispossessed and corrupted by the depredations of colonists and exploiters. Cyril, the Aborigine in Mates of Mars who is adept at martial arts, and becomes therefore a bouncer at an outer-suburban pub, stands as an unsentimental emblem of what the fact of Australia is capable of doing to native and immigrant alike. Australia Australia is more relaxed, more entertaining, yet no less bleak in its vision of the moral and social complexion of modern Australia. It begins in a fog- bound Hibernian world similar to the place where Finbar's career begins. But Wal- lace-Crabbe's narrative soon leaves behind the denizens of that world- Meg, Fen, and the ominously named Vallack the Crab (whose regal pomp is to descend to the twentieth-century Wallace-Crabbes), creatures who spend their lives scratching out a miserable existence on their wind-swept beaches and headlands- to explore the history of the world, and more particularly of Australia, engaging at length with a preposterous account of the emergence and the fortunes of the author's family.</page><page sequence="4">128 Critical Survey, volume 6, number 1 The novel, if that is how it may be termed, is an outrageous mixture of family history, fantasy and burlesque. Within its pages Wallace-Crabbe contrives to incorp- orate historical figures only remotely connected (if at all) with Australia: we follow Napoleon to St Helena, where the ex-emperor (afflicted with piles) plays cricket with his captors: He was in a filthy mood anyway, with the officers team clobbering his bowlers all over the place losing one wicket for 238. So in desperation, he brought himself on. You could tell straight out what he thought of defeat: features set in a kind of Waterloo expression, his mind so wound up that it seemed he'd forgotten all about the pain in his backside, (p. 65) Napoleon escapes to the Victorian goldfields, where he laments that the French were pipped to the post of claiming 'Australia Felix' by perfidious Albion, as he remarks in a letter to a confidant: But I am not here in Fontainebleau. Not so. I am in Nouvelles Galles du Sud, l'autre bout du monde. It is not French, pas encore, because that toady of the king, La Perouse, he forgot the fucking flag! Imagine that thing, forgot l'Ã©tendard nationalÃ¬ (p. 82) Other episodes of Australia Australia chart a dizzying history of Nouvelles Galles du Sud, coming to a climax with the life and times of the author himself. This beguiling farrago of history, family-lore and fantasy is punctuated by the orderly reappearance of Halley's Comet, a reminder of natural cycles, just as the lazy circumnavigation of the earth by a colony of sharks binds together the many narrative strands of this outrageous fable. It would be possible to dismiss Australia Australia as an irreverent, undergraduate sport. Yet even at his most fantastical and jesting, as in the musings of good King George (reproduced in part on the book's back cover), Wallace-Crabbe's prose is informed by anger and by disgust at the venal and corrupt vulgarity of the modern world: In fact, because he was no fool, sometimes when left alone to brood in chambers giving onto royal parklands, watching deer frolic and the royal rabbits flit into and out of the well- managed undergrowth, sometimes in these rare moments of peace George looked into the future and saw there a world well beyond his time and in that world he saw plastic, and it was good; and Tupperware he saw too and that also was good. And he saw pyramid selling, the perfection of the aristocratic system: a goal for humanity. Dreaming even further, this great mind had a vision of a world divided into two parts: east and west, and he knew that pyramid selling was the philosophy that could bring about a unification of these parts just as Hanoverianism had brought the Hun together with the Pom. Shall the crocodile lie down with the rat? (pp. 8-9) In passages such as these- and there are many throughout the novel- the authentic voice of a Tory anarchist may be heard. Such despair establishes a more significant link between Foster's work and Wallace-Crabbe's than the probably fortuitous narrat- ive similarities between Moonlite and Australia Australia would suggest. Both writers stand aloof from the prevailing tendencies of contemporary Australian writing. While each obviously engages with pressing ethical or social issues, and while each is capable</page><page sequence="5">Maverick voices: the novels of David Foster and Robin Wallace-Crabbe 129 of the anger and even despair that characterise the work of several recent writers, neither seems fired by those social or political ideals that form the central preoccupa- tions of most modern Australian writers. Questions of race, gender and cultural identity are not the important issues with Foster and Wallace-Crabbe that they have become in recent Australian writing. Neither seems capable of putting his faith in institutions or in ideals. On the contrary, both seem to be prompted by an all- pervading pessimism, their wrath is directed at humanity at large rather than at specific beliefs, ideologies or political systems. Each moreover expresses that sense of despair, an essentially anarchic vision of a world beyond redemption, in terms of outrageously brittle comedy. They are both driven by a sense of loss. The modern world, especially modern Australia, is denuded of those cultural and spiritual values which might be capable of sustaining life, or at least of making life a little less unendurable. Inevitably for both, such values are inherent in the cultural and artistic monuments of the old world of the Northern Hemisphere- except that each sees clearly, indeed most painfully, the sham and hypocrisy, as well as the strutting arrog- ance, of that world's pride in its cultural achievement. For that reason, perhaps, Foster is prone to take the great high-culture myths and legends of Europe to turn them on their heads in his demotic, essentially 'vulgar' revisions of time-hallowed tales. At times the result seems little more than burlesque: in The Adventures of Christian Rosy Cross, Foster discovers considerable comic verve in his irreverent debunking of the mystic pieties of Rosicrucianism: The bazaar at Fez is very crowded with is usual conglomerate of Berbers, Florentines, Gen- oese, Venetians, Egyptians, Syrians and Nubians. Christian enters a small magic shop and rings the bell on the counter. An old shop assistant comes out from behind a display of mummified monkeys' paws. 'Hello' he says, 'can I interest you in a farting cushion?' (p. 126) Nevertheless, most of Foster's novels, even a generally lightweight work like Testos- tero (a reworking of Goldoni's The Venetian Twins with several sideswipes at the Australian literary bureaucracy), employ burlesque, parody and other kinds of tom- foolery as means of registering a protest against the decline of a world where mystery, religion, art and intellect are reduced to a grunting, laconic vernacular. That aspect of Foster's art is nowhere more apparent than in his finest and most disturbing achievements to date, Plumbum and Mates of Mars. Each of these ambi- tious and large-scale novels suffers from a potential incoherence of structure, and also from an opaqueness that many readers find almost impossible to penetrate. Yet both works reveal a complex engagement with several disturbing issues and with the irreconcilable conflict between the plebeian present of Australia, its hedonistic vul- garity and lack of spiritual values, on the one hand, and on the other the allure of ancient cultural models which are, nevertheless, suspect, even perhaps no more than sham or chicanery. In Plumbum , the earlier of these novels, that dilemma remains unresolved; Mates of Mars offers, no matter how awkwardly or tentatively, an attempt at a resolution of sorts. Plumbum is a retelling, in the Australian vernacular, of the legend of Faust, and like that other twentieth-century novel based on the sixteenth-century legend,</page><page sequence="6">130 Critical Survey , volume 6, number 1 Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus, Foster's wry fable concerns itself with the musical enchantment of music. The difference is that while Mann found his modern equiva- lent for the allure of alchemy in the highly abstract practices of Schoenbergian serial- ism, Foster's characters, who constitute a type of composite Faust-figure, are expo- nents of heavy-metal rock. These characters, who eventually form the world's most successful heavy-metal band (hence the title of the novel), come together in the drab propriety of Canberra, that artificial, bureaucratic city which epitomises, in the novel's scheme of things, the spiritual desiccation of modern Australia. Their talent is mediocre; at first they achieve no greater fame than the occasional gig in a suburban pub. At length, they fall under the spell of a sinister and curious creature called Nick, who travels around in a mighty, gleaming prime mover. Nick offers the band a contrast and the promise of unimagined success. By the end of this freewheeling, at times almost impenetrable but always enthralling novel, Plumbum, the ultimate heavy-metal band, the exemplar of absolute 'power' (thanks to Nick's magnificent amplification system), rules the world. In a place called the Musiekcentrum in Utrecht, all power- political, emo- tional and moral- is invested in that group of zombified musos, whose career began in a Chinese restaurant in Canberra, that concentric hell from which Foster's Faust- figures have never been able to escape. Like most of Foster's work, Plumbum con- stantly returns, with grotesque and obsessive insistence, to a single preoccupation- the circular quest, at the end of which nothing is achieved: where we arrive is no different from the place we have left behind. If anything, it is a blacker hell. The implications of such a bleak, entirely pessimistic view of the possibilities of life at the end of the twentieth century are grave for both novelist and reader. Foster's chilling fables have met with indifference, occasionally with undisguised hostility. Their uncomfortable and unrelenting despair- no matter how jesting or clownish- provides, nevertheless, a vision to which all (and not merely the denizens of Australia) should attend. For the writer, though, the nihilism implicit in much of Foster's works must become ultimately an impediment. Foster's earlier works explore the possibility of appropriating monuments of European high culture for his laconic Australian fables, yet almost invariably- as with the Faust legend in Plumbum- such monuments prove to be brittle and hollow. If he is not to be silenced, the writer must discover some structure or set of beliefs that will contain and even perhaps sustain his work. In his most recent novel, Mates of Mars, Foster seems to have discovered such a structure in the practices and rituals of the martial arts. For readers of literary fiction, the notion of martial arts almost always implies the absolute contrary of art, civilisation and urbanity. In the opening section of this disturbing and compelling novel, Foster presents precisely that image: Steve, a para- plegic ex-martial-arts-instructor, lives in a wasteland on the outskirts of Sydney. He represents, even in his depleted state, the mindless worship of the body and of physical endurance; in short, that obsessed materialism which many see as one of the most alarming aspects of modern life. As Mates of Mars pursues its complicated and often wayward course through the lives of various characters- an Aboriginal rugby player, a Jewish medical scientist, a Malayan Chinese research-worker, a</page><page sequence="7">Maverick voices: the novels of David Foster and Robin Wallace-Crabbe 131 photographic model- all of whom are bound together by their being exponents of the martial arts, a curious sense of a form, of a discipline, even perhaps of a set of beliefs emerges. What may give shape and meaning to the disorganised and self- indulgent life of these people is not the consolation of art, the fond belief that high culture may endow its recipients with spiritual ennoblement, but the near-mystical discipline of an intricate and artificial system of combat. The brutal and the inchoate are tamed, briefly and provisionally perhaps, so that chaos and disintegration are at least delayed, though they may not be avoided. That is a crumb of comfort in Foster's otherwise almost entirely black vision of life. Wallace-Crabbe, whose outlook is more genial, less desperate at any rate, seems to be travelling in the opposite direction. The latest work to be published under his own name (as opposed to the stylish though often violent thrillers of Robert Wallace) reaches a Swift-like disgust at humanity, despite many passages of surrealistic farce. The novel is entitled Dogs; it is in essence a despairing animal-fable. Its gallery of human beings- farmers, industrial magnates, captains of commerce- display the most disgustingly brutal, indeed bestial qualities. As in some of the thrillers written under his nom de plume, or in a powerful earlier novel, Feral Palit, Wallace-Crabbe responds with alarm and disgust to humanity's cold-hearted cruelty towards animals. That brutality, as dis- played in the novel's catalogue of outrages, is all the more disturbing because of its nonchalance. The canines of all varieties that populate Dogs are not, however, senti- mentalised. This is no Australian Bambi. Rather, the novel becomes a celebration of anarchy. Wallace-Crabbe's anthropomorphic dogs, who drive fast cars, hold up banks, defraud corporations, and also become enthusiastic consumers of luxury goods, fulfil their own doggy amorality through mayhem, and by wreaking havoc among human- kind. In the pages of Dogs there is nothing to choose morally or ethically between the canine and the human; only the energy and candour of the former, their total lack of hypocrisy and humbug, serve to redeem them. This is neither a comfortable nor a reassuring tale. As in Wallace-Crabbe's other novels, or as in most of Foster's, there seems no possibility of redemption for society. All that the writer is capable of doing is giving voice to alarm and disgust. Such is not a formula for success or recognition; it does suggest, however, that the voices of these uncompromising writers will continue to be heard long after their much more anodyne contemporaries have been rendered silent.
