<plain_text><page sequence="1">OEDIPUS TYRANNUS AND THE PROBLEM OF KNOWLEDGE I AT LEAST TWO CLASSICISTS have hinted that the name Oedipus (Ol'rIwov3 ) might have special significance in Oedipus tyrannus.1 As this drama is about a man who wishes to know (olSa), it is my con- tention that it does have special meaning and that it is for this reason that Sophocles makes a play upon Oedipus' name in vari- ous places in the drama.2 This play treats the theme of knowledge as derived from the use of the senses, par- ticularly that of sight (4pdao). Though words for hearing (JKov'o) and touching (tav'o) also occur-the first with great fre- quency-there is certainly a closer correla- tion in the Greek mind between the faculty of sight and the ability to know than in the use of the other senses for the attainment of knowledge.3 The verb Lpda` (I see) is the activity which carried to completion results in knowledge (o1Sa, literally, "I have seen": in usage, "I know"). The purpose of this paper will be to show that the pervading theme of Oedipus tyrannus is the problem of knowledge and that this theme has Par- menidean overtones. At the outset Sophocles poses a problem for Oedipus, wrestling with which he will, at length, become acutely aware of his own human limitations, his own insufficient knowledge. This problem is a natural dis- aster, threatening with extinction the full range of physical life-a problem which demands a divine solution. At the beginning of the play, Sophocles presents Oedipus as a man of unusual resourcefulness and pre- science. His mental skills command respect. The priest and elders have come to him for assistance almost as if he were the center of their religious life. In his initial speech Oedipus shows his acumen with very active physical senses which immediately come into play. His eyes inform him of petitioners iKr-qp[oLv KXadoLctLv i'wErqAtvot. His sense of smell notifies him that the city OvLtkaJrmv y~eLt, and to his ears come sounds of chants and lamentations, wratavov E KL arrvayp1a'rv. Oedipus refers to himself as KXALVYo (line 8), renowned in everyone's eyes, for his solution of the Sphinx's riddle. At the play's end (line 1524) the chorus also re- minds the audience of this mental achieve- ment. Indeed the priest sets him just below the level of the gods for this reason. He wonders aloud, in response to Oedipus' initial address, whether he had a source 1Bernard Knox, Oedipus at Thebes (New Haven 1957), p. 127.

SOther words for the senses of seeing, hearing, and touching also occur, such as X~rww, KXVW, and Otyyc'w.

CHAMPLIN of divine inspiration or acted through human wit alone: ... ere r )ov e^i, '/ ,V aKO6as e t a7r' a ps of3 Od rov. (42-43) Two significant words here are aKov"as and oaB8a, showing the correlation of the use of the senses with the acquisition of human knowledge. In a later passage Oedipus credits himself solely for solving the riddle: 6 y ju6z ei 6ws Oi 6irovs, ~wavad 't'v, yv"4?7 Kpvp cas o03' wdr' oiwzvCjv tzaOdv. (397-398) The two passages cited contain the kernel of the philosophic theme of this drama. Sophocles portrays his hero, in full posses- sion of his physical senses and as having the knowledge that those senses can convey. The overriding question is whether, so equipped, he can master the problems which confront him. Throughout the play Sopho- cles uses the senses in conjunction with the acquisition of knowledge. At moments of crisis words for seeing, hearing, and touch- ing frequent the text. These are the sign- posts to watch for as the play progresses. As the opening scene advances, Creon reports the message from Apollo, god of truth, and Oedipus assumes an air of self- assurance as if accomplished in the art of sleuthing. Speaking of Laius, he says: oA' !Koov`*v ov- yhp dcrEdSdv yf wo (105). Note the confidence he expresses in his knowl- edge. This is typical of a man who has learned to depend on his own wit, this time in combination with only one of his senses. But with a pun on Oedipus' name Sopho- cles gives the Greek audience an ironic glimpse of Oedipus' physical weakness, as when the king asks Creon: KaicoY v ' 7rotiov, CErOGw7) Prvpavtv os Ofrw re-ovas, elpye 707o' 'et&amp;bevat; (128-129) The "evil before the feet" or "blocking the feet" was in a direct sense the Sphinx but indirectly Ocl'rov. In freeing the city from the Sphinx, he proves himself worthy of kingship. As he filled the vacuum left by Laius, the search for the killer was ne- glected, until the pollution caused by Oedipus' presence forced a renewed inquiry. During the same early scene with Creon, Oedipus very nearly equates himself with Apollo, as he says: WOT' vEIlKWS 6bECT6OE KcAE 96utaXov YZ1 r6e ?rtfzwpofzra -r ^Oe6 6' la. (135-136) This is a highly significant passage, for Apollo represents truth itself. In no esti- mation, save his own, could Oedipus claim the inborn quality of truth; yet he affirms his willingness to undertake the task of avenging Laius' death as a partner of the god. Even the word 6'tEOE has an ostenta- tious sense here. Having received information or "leads" from Apollo, Oedipus issues a proclamation, commanding that the murderer, if known, be disclosed and ordering him to be ban- ished. Three times in the speech the word o~Sa is used in some form, and what an ironic touch it has when Oedipus, the one who should have been in a state of knowl- edge, reveals his ignorance: 6o-rs w7oO' rNV c Aiiov r Ov AaP/a3KOV KaCrot&amp;i' dv6pbs tK rios &amp;WdXero .... (224-225) Equally ironic is the next use of the word in the same speech, since it so obviously reflects his lack of knowledge: ei 3' ai -res &amp;XXov, oe&amp;, d' 'kXX/s xovbso Tr aivTXetpa, ? aUltwr.rTw ... (230-231) Eager to be helpful and hoping to dis- cover the truth, the Chorus tactfully offers a significant suggestion to Oedipus: CvaK7r' apvaKNrT 7raO' 6pPT' eriaTra/Iat LdXara 'oi/pw Tetpeoiav,, rap' 0o Trs a"t - KO/r ) 2r 6, cbva", 6I0t c[O a oaqC~rarct (284-286) In its desire to show deference to Oedipus the Chorus has equated Apollo, Teiresias, and Oedipus by calling them all "lord" though it assigns to Teiresias the closer acquaintance with Phoebus. The sentence</page><page sequence="3">OEDIPUS TYRANNUS AND THE PROBLEM OF KNOWLEDGE 339 structure as well as its meaning conveys Teiresias' close acquaintance with Apollo. The titles for the two, men stand side by side in line 284 and their names in juxta- positional identity in line 285. The entire scene with Teiresias teems with references to knowing or understand- ing (4povw) and seeing (Opdwr) employed with clear differentiation. Just before the prophet's entrance Oedipus with his usual air of adequacy makes an effort to recon- struct earlier events. He shows familiarity with rumored accounts: -'Kovoa Ka&amp;y/ r-Yv 8' 1S8Ovr' Ov&amp;St op (293). Oedipus assigns him- self quite a sense of mental acuity as he uses in this brief line three words denoting sense activity! He wishes to, give the im- pression of a man as watchful as Argus. From this self-appointed height of per- ception no one is more capable than he of according to Teiresias his proper worth. Oedipus then credits Teiresias with knowl- edge of heavenly and earthly matters and pays him the ultimate tribute of possessing intuitive knowledge: ArXLP [Uv, eL Ka [L? pOXr6ELs, cpoVE s' 3' w o'a v w y6avea rLv .... (302-303) "Without physical eyesight you are aware of the plight of the city," says he. Yet a bit of insincerity appears to creep in as Oedipus in the next breath explains Phoe- bus' message, thereby attributing a degree of ignorance to the seer. All through this passage the word "truth" (r&amp;ArlOS) is used in some form, first by the Chorus with relation to Teiresias' nature: j rXTa',kO GErEAVKEV Jv6pW7rv pEdvw (298-299), and then by the prophet as he designates himself an exponent of truth: 7-E'Evya a rXyOE" yahp lu~xov rpT~o (356); ELrTEop 7T ' iUT Tq ay~q&amp;tas auOvo' (369). It becomes pertinent to ask what Sophocles meant by the "truth." Careful consideration would lead one to believe that the word "truth" is used in the play primarily as denoting the facts of human experience, either those concealed facts which have determined human cir- cumstances or those which are prophesied. Either use would require the intuitive knowledge of a prophet. Was Teiresias, as an exponent of truth, on the general level of an Old Testament prophet? Sophocles speaks of him as cognizant of ineffable heavenly matters. The strictures of the play demanded only that he possess a full awareness of past and future human events. Knowing the truth of these was a source not of joy but of sorrow. We should remind ourselves that, if the Chorus could know of a divine realm where the laws of Olympus originate and Justice holds sway, Teiresias would also be cognizant of this more meta- physical sense of truth. A climactic confrontation of knowledge and ignorance is reached in this scene. Tei- resias reveals the truth that Oedipus is the murderer of Laius, but Oedipus completely and instantly rejects the charges, not seek- ing any clarification. In his mental darkness the king upbraids Teiresias for blindness with respect to his ears, mind, and eyes in this alliterative line: rvf74A r7 r' Jra rTOV 7E vovY rT r' /tar' d (371). Then Oedipus charges Teiresias with being an accessory to the criminal death of Laius. Reasoning cleverly-but mistakenly- he deduces a plot against his throne and life, with Creon as the other malefactor. The next scene with Creon is ushered in with several verbal configurations, associ- ating the senses and human knowledge, as Creon tries to ascertain what charges were made against himself, the presumed fellow conspirator. The Chorus says: l r TO pv rda', o2la 8' o yvI,4~ rivi (527). Incredulously Creon tries to determine in what state of stupe- faction Oedipus might have made such charges: ?' [L[dlTwC ' pOdv r 7 KcdL 6pO79 pEv6y Ka-r7Y opet-i o 7oriKX? /aL -root TU ov; (528-529) The Chorus responds evasively: o0K 0d'. ~ y-p 3pao' o0 KpaTro0VTES obx Ap6 (530). Creon</page><page sequence="4">340 MARJORIE W. CHAMPLIN builds a sound case against his own impli- cation in the imagined plot, but Oedipus seeing darkly, remains unpersuaded. In frustration, but without violence, Creon makes an observation on Oedipus' mental confusion: ov yp fpovo?^vrd o' E3 3flVr7M (626). Jocasta, undoubtedly drawn to the scene by the uproar, enters. With her entrance the fearsome truth perversely begins to dawn in Oedipus' mind. In attempting to quiet Oedipus' fear, Jocasta discredits Teiresias as being in the number of the unreliable prophets. Then in disclosing some additional facts about Laius' demise she awakens a dread recollection in Oedi- pus' mind. At this tragic dawn of knowledge he laments: ELV(,S ~UOvpt o~fro b v~oCvr? j (747). Oedipus' conception of Teiresias has changed twice in a brief time. Initially he exalts the seer; next he reviles him; finally, coming full circle, he begins to, accord him respect once again. Jocasta remains in darkness. In her ear- nest attempt tot discredit Teiresias' disclo- sures as falsehood, she inadvertently has brought to light the truth which he revealed. At the close of the scene Jocasta, by reason of her own myopic state, comforts Oedipus with the supposed falsity of an oracle al- ready delivered, condemning the seer and Loxias in one breath (lines 851-854). The reaction of the Chorus to the denial of the validity of oracular responses is forceful. They pledge themselves to greater sanctity affirming the existence of divine laws. Thereafter they condemn insolence and pride using the word ri"po7-ra with ap- propriate pointedness for the man of haughty mien and manner. In. the word vrpo7ra there may be an indirect reference to Oedipus, who has now been disclosed as the possible murderer of Laius.4 The Chorus displays a pronounced revul- sion at the thought of Jocasta's religious impiety. As Victor Ehrenberg says in Sophocles and Pericles, "the poet (Sopho- cles) is opposed in heart and soul" to the "man-made standards" and morality which Jocasta represents.5 In the Athens of Soph- ocles' day oracular responses and even the gods themselves were subject to skeptical questioning. Sophocles remonstrated. Un- doubtedly his voice is joined with that of the Chorus as they pray for confirmation of the truths of prophecy and ask for assur- ance in their observance of religious piety. The messenger from Corinth enters, and the full disclosure of the truth is postponed. Jocasta's skepticism seems to be solidly based as she says to Oedipus: aKovUE 7' dV6pos 70o 6, Ka1 CTKOTreL KXPWUV Trd o(X e ' 'P' Kt T70O Oeo0 iavTreV/ia-ra. (952-953) Notice the prominence given the two words for "hearing" in this speech, in which Jocasta presuming her knowledgeability denounces "the holy oracles of the god." After this careless denunciation one is not surprised to hear her make this tasteless statement, following the messenger's initial disclosure: Kat \LUYv uE`ya3 y' d84OaXhlos o0i 7rarpZo rLqot (987). The unusual use of 0/aX'yd above can best be explained as indicating that the author's purpose is to relate the use of the senses to knowledge." As the scene moves on, the Corinthian messenger brings more and more facts to the forefront. Two opposing forces provide tension here, the one to conceal knowledge, the other to disclose it. Oedipus, true to his nature, continues to, probe; and Jocasta, completely aware now of the situation, tries vainly to block full disclosure: 8V;7orp/', 4Bernard Knox believes that the Chorus in Strophe B' is referring not to Jocasta alone but also to Oedipus, whose past, they have just learned, has been tarnished with the stain of blood: Oedipus at Thebes, p. 174. 5Oxford 1954, p. 72. SAs R. C. Jebb (Sophocles [Cambridge 1893] Part I, pp. 132-133) notes, the use of the word is not "merely (though this notion comes in) 'a great help to seeing' that oracles are idle." He relates it to the idea of "a bright, sudden com- fort." Jebb does not see what appears to me the more obvious reason for the usage-its relation to the theme of the play.</page><page sequence="5">OEDIPUS TYRANNUS AND THE PROBLEM OF KNOWLEDGE 341 EO epor oEvoE ol 8 E (1068). But Oedi- pus' will-to-know cannot be suppressed. It has led him to the tragic knowledge that he murdered his father, and it will soon expose his fateful identity. At this crucial moment, as at others, the senses come designedly into play. The herdsman says woefully: o0uor, wrpo' aimro y' Ei, 7-r &amp;wSEt ,ykLtE (1169). And Oedipus' determined response: d ayy aKovIaEv AXX' O/Ocs aKoVUTEIo/ (1170). By the recurring and obvious employ- ment of sense terminology, the poet has heightened tension and highlighted the play's deep message. This is the inadequacy of unaided human intelligence to, master life's larger problems. When the Chorus learns the identity of Oedipus, it is caught between a sensed need for proper retribu- tion and a profound feeling of pity for the king. Note how deliberately in this speech, Sophocles personifies time by assigning to it the potential of vision: 4/i~qipe a' dKOVO' 6 criV6' 6pCV Xp6VOS, &amp;tKcteL 7 )r' &amp;yaoLP yaLOP rrdXat T7KVOPV7Ta Kat 7TeKPVOLpEOV. (1212-1214) and then, after solemn sermonizing, the Chorus expresses its heartfelt grief: e&amp;'e o' e0 e 6 e /i 7ror' ela6paPv. (1217-1218) The complete reversal of Oedipus' for- tunes has been precipitated. As darkness appears to close in on all sides, the illusion of achievement ceases to be even an illu- sion. The Chorus' abysmal despair over Oedipus' decline is prolonged as a second messenger excitedly signals another dis- aster: ' y'?s ALyto-ra 7m0ar' aet rt/Wj/LePoLt, o0' ipy' dKoIjeEOa', ota ' ei6~eO'ea'. (1222-1223) and a minute later: ... r-EOvcE Octovy 'Io- KruTa? Kdpa (1235). The messenger's next speech describes Oedipus' viewing of the sight and, as might be expected, carries frequent references to "seeing," as Oedipus blinds himself: apas EratceeJ 0apOapa ri P abrov KUKX O, ad&amp;p rotavO', BOOViVeK' OUK 0OLV76 VLV o0 ' o' wrraaxepr 0o0' drroi' 3pa KaKc. (1270-1272) With one sense rendered useless, Oedipus must make use of another. Beseeching Creon to send for his children, he says: ...

(1466-1470) What has always and inevitably gripped an audience at this point in Oedipus tyran- nus is a depressing sense that an intelligent man has unaccountably met a tragic re- versal of fortune. This is one of the appar- ently intended effects. And there are still more deliberate implications concerning the futility of man's human achievements. There are, however, positive notes which need accent. Prophecy has been fulfilled. The gods and the oracles themselves have been vindicated. Removal of Oedipus as a source of pollution must bring restored health to the people and physical soundness to their surroundings. Life will go on. This restoration of order concludes the play as Oedipus plans for the burial of his wife and his own removal from Thebes. The evidence of a restoration of inner order within man's consciousness is sounded by Creon's reminder of the governance of the divine: Kac\ yap a v\ v riv v r O&amp; E) 7rtyv ppo1t (1445). The last two speeches are enormously significant. Creon urges upon Oedipus ap- propriate humility, since the superiority he attained to could not support him through- out his life: racipra t7 P3o6Xou KpaTG7PV Ka- yap aKpai3fras o~L /3L oot Uw7vPeI6 7re70.

An- axagoras was a familiar figure in Periclean circles, and his acceptance by Pericles' own coterie was indicative of a general interest in philosophical and scientific concerns.8 Another philosopher-scientist who made a demonstrably profound impression in this era was Parmenides of Elea. Since there is considerable evidence that his stout defend- ant and pupil, Zeno, resided for a time in Athens, visited the residence of Pericles, and taught several prominent Greeks there, one is just in assuming that Sophocles, who also frequented Periclean circles, was ac- quainted with Parmenidean monism. In- deed broad hints of Parmenidean influence appear in Oedipus tyrannus.9 The Parmenidean monism involved a denial of sense testimony as a basis of true knowledge, and it set up a world of truth completely apart from the realm of the senses. This realm was approachable through the use of reason coupled with spiritual vision, as Parmenides himself taught. The effect of this Eleatic monism must have been massive, comparable to that of Einstein's discoveries in our own age. The irrefutable logic could not and still cannot be ignored. Werner Jaeger says that Parmenides of Elea "was one of the greatest philosophers who ever lived. . . . In every epoch of Greek philosophy the effect of his work can be traced, and even today he is a lead- ing representative of a permanent philo- sophical position."10 Antony Charles Lloyd, professor of phil- osophy at the University of Liverpool, corroborates Jaeger's evaluation. He com- ments discerningly that Parmenides' theory was stated in such abstract terms that widely divergent intellectuals could adapt it to their own purposes. Professor Lloyd affirms that both Democritus and Leucip- pus took Parmenides' concept of Being into consideration when they propounded their theories. Plato made use of it in the Pla- tonic system of ideas.-' The poet Pindar, emulating Parmenides, showed a deep con- cern-even enthusiasm-for "absolute be- ing" and man's momentary glimpses of it.12 Furthermore Aristotle spoke of the "science of truth as it was introduced by the school of Anaxagoras and Parmenides."13 C. Maurice Bowra and Karl Reinhardt have hinted that Oedipus tyrannus may have reflected Parmenidean philosophy.14 7 Though he does not confirm the skepticism, Jebb observes in his footnotes (p. 198) to the quoted lines (1524-1530) that there has been some question as to their validity; but the several references to the words for the senses should put to rest such doubts and show a continuity to the play never before observed. 8 Ehrenberg, Sophocles and Pericles. The author retells (p. 149) a story of Plutarch's in which the scientist-philosopher Anaxagoras and the seer Lampon both vie for Pericles' mind and favor. 9 Francis M. Cornford, in his book Plato and Parmenides (London 1951), p. 63, states that, according to information in Alcibiades I.119A, "Pythodorus and Callias had each paid Zeno a hundred minae for his instruction," and Plutarch (Pericles 4) says that Pericles had heard Zeno discourse." He adds further, "There is thus inde- pendent evidence for Zeno's residence in Athens." 10 Paideia: the ideals of Greek culture, vol. I (New York 1939), p. 174.

While asserting no direct tie between the Eleatic philo- sophy and the play, Reinhardt does see the play as one dealing with human illusion or the fallacious basis of human knowledge. Other classicists have made scattered references to the "truth and illusion" theme, as, for example, Victor Ehrenberg, who states categorically, but without pressing the matter beyond this statement that: "the conflict between divine truth and human illusion, the main theme of 'Oedipus Ty- rannus', was a well-known topic of Greek thought both philosophical and religious."'5 Although it would not have served Ehren- berg's purpose to discuss it, the theme of divine truth and human illusion is an integ- ral part of the theme of knowledge; and this was certainly a preoccupation of Oedipus tyra~nnus. To Parmenides absolute truth was the only valid knowledge, and he who was not conscious of truth was in a state of human delusion. It would be incorrect to say that Sophocles in Oedipus tyrannus displayed an awareness of the Absolute as vivid as Parmenides', but I think he meant to draw a sharp distinction between the limited knowledge drawn from the senses and acted upon by the human mind and the more inclusive and often intuitive knowl- edge imparted by Deity.'6 Oedipus was a representative of the first, Teiresias of the second. There is internal textual evidence that Oedipus tyrannus was, not only a play about knowledge, but also a play having Eleatic overtones. C. M. Bowra has pro- vided some evidence, though rather inad- vertently. In his chapter on King Oedipus (see n. 14) he mentions, though not in con- nection with Parmenides' doctrine of "the One and the Many," that Oedipus (842- 845), Jocasta (715-716), Creon (107), and the Chorus (292) are all trapped in the world of illusion. As a result, they confuse the one murderer with the many of a reported account. In my opinion, this Sophoclean contrivance of numerical misin- formation establishes a significant connect- ing link between the play and the poem. There are, in addition various other hints that Sophocles may have been familiar with Pardmenides' poem. In the lines of Oedipus' second speech the king states: 'XX' LUTE roXXA LeP' ALE B6aKp'lJaV7a a , 7roXXa's ' obvis A~X66ra &lt;Ppo7"~raos rXdvots. (66-67) This appears to be an unusual use of 680' in combination with a word for mental inquiry. Yet in the sixth fragment of Par- menides' poem these lines appear: pus tyrannus, mentions three philosophical state- ments of Heraclitus. He has thus tied the message of the play to Pre-Socratic philosophy, especially as he has also referred to Parmenides. My reasons for seeing a more decisive cause-effect relationship between Parmenides' teaching and Sophocles' play are these: The themes of the play-knowl- edge-ignorance (divine intuition vs. sense-based knowledge), sight-blindness, truth-illusion, one- ness-manyness-relate directly to the Parmenidean philosophy in its well-defined statements of Being. Heraclitus touched upon some of these but in an imprecise, often self-contradictory manner. The fact that he set up the doctrine of mutability as an Absolute would have been an offense to both Parmenides and Sophocles. Further Zeno's pres- ence in Athens, and possibly Parmenides' would have made Sophocles more susceptible to the enormous impact of the Eleatic doctrines. Note also that Reinhardt, an eminent European Classi- cist, and one who has to his credit a book entitled Parmenides und die Geschichte der griechischen Philosophie, alludes only to Parmen- ides' philosophy in his deep analysis of the play, 15Sophocles and Pericles, p. 143. 16 Along with Parmenides, Sophocles seems to have attributed to the physical world an illusory state. Sophocles and Parmenides appear to part company when the playwright attributes to Deity (Apollo) the source presumably of Absolute Truth, an awareness of the human condition. This would have made a Deity aware of "non- Being." It is most likely that Sophocles' Apollo was still a rather traditional Homeric god with anthropomorphic aspects.</page><page sequence="8">344 MARJORIE W.

An illuminating comment of Werner Jae- ger points up the correlation of the word 06 0 with thought activity in Parmenides. Though he is speaking of Parmenides alone, the exposition is relevant also to the pas- sage quoted from Oedipus tyrannus: Parmenides held that the discovery of pure reason and of the stringent rules of logical thought meant the discovery of a new 'road' to truth-in fact, of the only practicable one. In Greek philosophy the metaphor of the right road (b66s) of re- search constantly reappears; although it was only a metaphor, it has an almost technical sound about it, especially in the contrast of the right road and the wrong, where it approaches the sense of 'method'. This concept, fundamental in the develop- ment of scholarship, was created by Par- menides; for he was the first thinker who deliberately endeavoured to solve the problem of philosophical method, and clearly distinguished the two chief chan- nels in which, thenceforth, philosophical research was to run-thought and per- ception, the way of the senses and the way of reason.18 The passages from Sophocles and Par- menides just quoted both use the word 060~ in the sense of method. Parmenides was not only the originator of the use of 06d8, to mean a 'method' of inquiry, but as can be discovered from a check with the word- index of Diels' Fragmente,19 he used it seven times in this manner in our fragments of his poem. Is it too bold to make a conjecture that Sophocles appropriated this use of the word S0,3 and from precisely this source, inas- much as the play is one in which Oedipus pursues truth by the "method" of persistent investigation? The fact that Sophocles was a younger contemporary of Parmenides, that Parmenides made an immeasurable impact on his age, as well as the fact that the poet and playwright are concerned with the problem of knowledge, lends credence to this conjecture. Another use of the word 68d0 with a philosophic twist occurs near the conclusion of the play, when Oedipus is transferring his mantle of authority to, Creon. He utters this prayer: cXX' efrvoUil0'7, K a c 7E U6 T7ccs 60 6altw L)1v 7I7tov a ' lc povpcas 7-vXot. (1478-1479) Here the word 6~8d3 is connected with &amp;al/Wov and reminds one of the SaliovEs and OEu which guide Parmenides into the realm of true Being.20 Three other passages in Oedipus tyran- nus might support the linkage between that play and fragments of Parmenides. In the lines of the sixth fragment, already quoted, Parmenides refers to the double-minded mortals who live in an imagined world of reality as EUSdrE oZ8/v; correspondingly in line 397 of Sophocles' play Oedipus in a deceptive state of self-exaltation calls him- self 6 i'v jSv E''t Oi 7r0ov3. It might be argued that this phrase was 17Herman Diels, Die Fragmente der Vorsok- ratiker (Zurich 1966), p. 233. (N.B. The verb 7rXdvrTorat in this fragment is taken by Diels as the equivalent of Xcia'ovurat.) I believe the verb irXCd-rw should stand as it is in the text, since its meaning as "imagine," "invent," or "fabricate" elucidates Parmenides' accusation against his con- temporaries that their world is a concoction of their imagination.

In adding a historical per- spective, Professor John Finley has called to my attention the fact that thought as travel, clearly a Parmenidean metaphor, was not unique to Parmenides. He referred me to various places where this figure of speech with slightly different connotations occurred in the Odyssey (8.481; 22.347); the Iliad (15.80-82); Pindar (N.5.2-3; 0.6.22-28); and Heraclitus (Diels, Vorsokratiker, 4th ed. 1922, I 86, fr. 45). 20 Diels, Fragmente, Vol. I, pp. 228, 230.</page><page sequence="9">OEDIPUS TYRANNUS AND THE PROBLEM OF KNOWLEDGE 345 too casual a one to! link significantly the play and the poem. If the play were not linked to the poem in general subject mat- ter, this would be true. But the two are so obviously concerned with the theme of knowledge that it can have philosophic significance when related to Oedipus' actual state of ignorance. Parmenides goes on to describe the "know-nothing" mortals in lines immedi- ately following those quoted of Fragment 6. He says of them: 01.

Finally may we not say that Oedipus had traveled on the 7raXtvrpo7r-b KxC~AeV0 from the start of the play like one of the CKptr-a cpiXa mentioned by Parmenides? The period of the play marked the complete reversal of his fortune, until he came to the point of yearning to block the sorrow-bring- ing sense organs: .. oK av cOX6OLV T o1? dAnroKX-oaaL 7-ovFiOV a6XAtov 'Aas, 'v' 5 -rv(uAs, -E KaT KXwV M' " P'b yA&amp;p 7rv porb' 'Qw TrWyV KaKWV OIKeV "YXVUKU. (1387-1390) These very organs whose impartations of fact seemed to bring Oedipus to an unsur- passed height of self-awareness and knowl- edge-able prestige he now recognized, as Parmenides did, to be the communicators of dire knowledge. As Teiresias is the spokesman for intui- tive truth in the drama, so Parmenides is his counterpart in the poem; as Oedipus, the Everyman,22 lived in a state of self- deception, so for the same causes do the uncritical throngs mentioned in Parmen- ides' poem. Even the chorus intones the hymn of humanity caught in the world of the "Seem- ing": icw yeveat 8Ppo-rWv, cws v~is ~ aa Kaat r-r6 7r&amp;y 'v a as fvaptOAiw. -rs Y p, -rs dv 'p wrekov 7as e $awL ovias (b/pet 770roaov-rovr ~6So - OKeCV Ka 6av7' cxroOcX pa ... .*23 (1186-1192) Later in his life Sophocles wrote a play in which he has shown his Everyman ad- vancing to a state of true self-knowledge. In Oedipus at Colonus the hero, blind to the world around him-perhaps because he is blind to the world of the senses-acquires inner vision and takes on the prophetic qualities and capabilities of Teiresias. Sophocles' Oedipus, the man who solved the Sphinx's riddle, seems at length to have solved the riddle of man. MARJORIE W. CHAMPLIN North Kingstown Senior High School 21 Ibid., p. 233. 22 E. R. Dodds, "On misunderstanding the Oedipus rex," Greece and Rome, vol. XII (Ox- ford 1965), p. 148. Dodd suggests that Sophocles intended a kind of universal depiction of man. Werner Jaeger (Paideia, vol. I, p. 284) says he personifies "suffering humanity." 23 Immediately below the reference to Parmen- ides in his textual study, Reinhardt cites the chorus quoted above as proof that Oedipus tyran- nus is not a tragedy of fate but a play about human seeming.</page></plain_text>
