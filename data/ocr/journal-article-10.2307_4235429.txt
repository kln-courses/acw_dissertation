A. Laponce Department of Political Science University of British Columbia Vancouver, British Columbia Canada Abstract Languages are territorial. They tend to oc- cupy homogeneous, well bounded areas. When they do not, they lessen their chances of survival, espe- cially if they are languages of minority groups. Reaching beyond the usual sociological causes of this phenomenon, this article searches the neurophysiological and the psychological literature for explanation of the tendency of closed, equalita- rian systems with a high density of communication to move toward unilingualism. The search is guided by the questions: are bilinguals less brain-lateralized than unilinguals? Are different languages stored in different "containers" in the bilingual memory? Are the reaction times for coding and encoding slower in a second language than in a dominant language, slower in multilingual compared to unilingual set- tings? What are the psychological costs and benefits of bilingualism? The hypothesis that the bilingual brain is different from the unilingual brain is not supported by the literature, but some fascinating studies keep the question open. Only two sets of findings emerge to offer likely explanations of language territoriality: the findings that measure the declining level of perfor- mance in a second as compared to a first language when the complexity of the task is increased, and the findings that show multilingual communication to be less efficient, due to interferences and delayed reac- tion times, than the same communication in a single language. Languages are territorial. By concentrating "their" speakers in physical space, languages increase their chances of surviving, prospering, and assimilat- ing the competitors that enter their midst (Weinreich, 1968; Laponce, 1984). This concentra- tion can be explained by a variety of cultural and political factors that range from ethnic bonding (van den Berghe, 1981) to language planning ? la Bel- gium or Switzerland (McRae, 1964, 1984), and more simply and obviously, to the desire to be well understood by one's doctor, grocer, politician, or clergyman. One may need to communicate at any time, and this communication may be vital; hence the understandable tendency to settle among neigh- bors who speak the tongue one speaks best. These and other social factors, such as the cost of learning a second language, are sufficient to explain the territorial groupishness of languages. Why not then follow Durkheim's advice and be satisfied that the social explain the social; why search for additional psychological and neurophysiological explanations? Not only, I hope, because trespassing on the ground of other disciplines is, among social sciences, a distinguishing feature of both political science and sociology (Laponce, 1980), but also because of the advantages that result from securing the biological anchors of human behavior. The biological explana- tion is more likely than the social to offer us the constants, the universal effects that can be used to measure the strength of the cultural factors that either reinforce or contradict them. For this last reason I will survey the recent literature on the bilingual brain and on the bilingual mind, in the hope that it will provide, or at least indicate, these con- stants. POLITICS AND THE LIFE SCIENCES. Vol. 4, No. 1, August 1985 ISSN 0730-9384 ? 1985 by the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences</page><page sequence="2">4 Going Beyond the Whorf/Sapir Hypothesis Is there a cultural difference between monolinguals and bilinguals? At the most obvious level of under- standing of the question, the answer is "Yes, of course." The bilingual and the polyglot differ from the unilingual by the mere fact that they have access either to different languages that express different roles (diglossia) or to different symbolic systems that express the same roles by means of compound or coordinate multilingualism.1 Different languages give access to different corpora of signifi- es, hence, nearly always, to different images and different associations of ideas. But, at a deeper level of understanding, the question of cultural difference is not as easily answered. Sapir and Whorf (Sapir, 1949; Whorf, 1956) hypothesized that the bilingual cannot translate thoughts, hence attitudes, from one language into another without introducing a bias imposed by the language in which he or she thinks, speaks, or writes. That hypothesis remains contro- versial. Although language does not lend itself to the disentangling of the cultural from the biological, let us go beyond the Whorf/Sapir hypothesis and pose the questions: are bilinguals different from unil- inguals, neurophysiologically as well as psychologi- cally, and, if so, are there political consequences? The review of the literature will not provide us with firm answers, merely some circumstantial evidence indicating that the mind does not operate as effec- tively if it has to shift from one language to another, than if it operates in a single linguistic system. Neuropsychology may thus be part of the explana- tion of the tendency of language groups to occupy homogeneous territorial areas and to protect them- selves by means of enveloping spatial boundaries. The Bilingual Brain: The Neuropsychological Evidence When, in a different context, I posed the question: are left-handers socially and politically different from right-handers (Laponce, 1975, 1981), it made sense to find out whether there were differences of a genetic nature between them. In the case of lan- guage, it is likely that genetic differences explain why some people acquire second languages more easily than others (Hatch, 1983), but there is no reason to believe that these genetic differences are not evenly distributed across cultures. They will not concern us here. If we become bilingual it is not because of an urge to speak more than one tongue to oneself (for examples of pathological exceptions, see Steyn, 1922); it is because we want or need to communicate with other people who happen not to speak our own language. From my political point of view, the interesting question is, thus, not whether biology helps us to understand differences in the ability of individuals to acquire second languages and to shift from one language to another/ but rather to find out whether the brain is so structured that it does not store, retrieve, and use two lan- guages as effectively as one, or, at least, does not store, retrieve, and use two languages equally well. If this could be established, it would then follow that the governments that seek to promote policies of bilingualism at the individual level by mixing lan- guages territorially, would pursue policies that are dysfunctional, if not socially, then at least neurop- sychologically. If, on the other hand, the evidence points in the opposite direction, then these same governments would be right in promoting a bilin- gualism by superposition at the individual level rather than by the juxtaposition of different ethnol- inguistic groups, each with its own territorial niche. The Bilingual Memory The asymmetry of the human body, that is, the visible asymmetries of the hands, and to a lesser extent of the legs and the eyes, has long been noted and used by both science and religion to explain man and the cosmos. Knowledge of the asymmetry between the left and right brain, however, is recent knowledge, dating back little more than a hundred years. Although neurologists do not agree among themselves on the significance of that asymmetry, they agree, whether they are locationists or not, that in the normal individual the left brain is that which dominates in the performing of analytical functions and, particularly, in producing the sequential order- ing of concepts required by verbal or written com- munication in any given language, whether natural or artificial. This widespread interest in the comparison of the two hemispheres of the brain has led to the ques- tion: If the normal unilingual (typically a right-hander) is left brain dominant as far as language is con- cerned, what of the bilingual or the polyglot? Are the latter similarly lateralized? Are Bilinguals Less Lateralized Than Unilinguals? Albert and Obler (1978) hypothesized, on the basis of the limited evidence at their disposal, that the brain of the bilingual was more bilateral3 than that of the unilingual. Subsequent studies showed the hy- pothesis to be, at best, only partially correct. In his review of those studies, Bermy Shanon (1982) distin- guishes two major possible interpretations of the original assumption. The first leads one to expect that the two languages of a bilingual are less lateralized than that of a unilingual. That interpreta-</page><page sequence="3">5 tion finds practically no support in the literature. The second states that the bilingual is less lateralized in the non-native language. That interpretation is par- tially supported by the literature (see for example Walters and Zatorre, 1978), but calls for distinctions that require the introduction of two intervening fac- tors: a) the age at which the second language was acquired, and; b) the way in which it was acquired. A model built by Vaid and Genesee (1980:432) from the studies that used these factors,4 assumes: "Right hemisphere involvement is more likely in the initial stages of second language acquisition, the younger the learner, and less likely the older the learner, insofar as adults, relative to children, are more likely to use a formal mode of processing language." The studies from which Vaid and Gene- see derived this assumption used a variety of tech- niques, ranging from EEG measurements (Rogers, TenHouten et al., 1977) to the more common tests of responses to stimuli presented to the right and to the left visual fields (Bentin, 1981, for example), or to the left and right ears (Gordon and Zatorre, 1981; Galloway, 1982). More powerful tests involving pene- tration of the body, such as the Wada test that paralyzes one side at a time by injection of sodium armytal in the carotid artery, have, for obvious reasons, hardly ever been used. One such test was made by Rapport and Tan (1983) on four Chinese- English dextral polyglots who suffered from cerebral disorders and who were fluent, in varying degrees, in English and/or Hokkien, Cantonese, and Manda- rin. The Wada test, as well as a cortical stimulation test, led the authors to conclude that they had found no evidence to support the theory that people who speak Chinese, or polyglots in general, have an increased participation of the right hemisphere in their language functions. However, the number of subjects was very small and the number of uncon- trolled factors high, since the subjects had not been selected for the experiments; they were patients treated for markedly different degrees of brain disor- der. If the hypothesis that bilinguals, at least some types of bilinguals, are not as lateralized as unil- inguals is still very much alive, that hypothesis has not yet generated the data that would enable us to tell whether unilinguals and bilinguals differ in their brain functions to a degree that matters. We may nevertheless ask ourselves, at this point, what likely social and political consequences might be attrib- uted to the asymmetrical models of Albert and Obler (1978) or Vaid and Genesee (1980), should they be verified. In so doing, let us consider some fascinat- ing yet unconfirmed studies which suggest the possibility that different languages are processed differently by the brain because of their specific visual and/or auditive qualities. Are Some Languages Differently Lateralized? The studies by Rogers and TenHouten (1977) and by Tsunoda (1978) are guided by the hypothesis that the difference in lateralization is not so much be- tween unilinguals and bilinguals as among lan- guages. Rogers and TenHouten's study of Hopi- English bilinguals notes that Hopi is more apposi- tional, English more propositional, i.e., that Hopi puts the speaker in a natural context while English abstracts the speaker from the environment in order to analyze the latter. The authors use this semantic difference to explain the variations they recorded when measuring the alpha waves on the right side of the brain of subjects listening to stories told either in Hopi or in English. The study has been criticized for the lack of controls on such factors as degree of attention paid to the teacher reciting the stories (Vaid and Genesee, 1980) but has not thus far been invalidated by retests. Tsunoda's experiment shows a similar type of difference in brain lateralization, this time between Japanese and English subjects. The differences in this case, however, were apparently related to the native speakers' pronunciation rather than to the semantics of the language concerned. Tsunoda notes that his Japanese subjects process natural sounds such as the rustling of leaves or the rolling of waves in their left brain, while Westerners process these same sounds on the right side. He explains the difference by the fact that Japanese is (with Polynesian) the only language to use the steady vowel sound to signify that which requires the use of vowels and consonants in other languages. It is as if their very language had trained the Japanese (and Polynesians) to process some natural sounds in the left brain. Still according to Tsunoda, this difference in brain processes would contribute to explaining why the Japanese experience particular difficulties in learning a Western language, a language that would be, to them, excessively analytical.5 If confirmed, the Rogers/tenHouten and Tsunoda findings would give a very specific biological under- pinning to the Whorf/Sapir hypothesis that lan- guages, at least some of them, are culture specific, hence not fully translatable. It would, at least, pro- vide an additional explanation of the resistance to shift from one language to another. In short, the hypothesis of a difference in brain lateralization between unilinguals and bilinguals, as well as in the brain lateralization of different lan- guages, although denied by a large segment of the literature, is still very much alive. At the moment, however, it would be premature to infer from the neurophysiological evidence available on the brain sidedness of bilinguals an explanation of the ten-</page><page sequence="4">6 dency of closed and well integrated social systems to move toward unilingualism rather than in the opposite direction. One or Two Containers; Single or Multiple Switches? In addition to the Broca area of the brain, which is involved in the production of synthetic and morpho- logical structures, and the Wernicke area, which processes messages received through the auditory channels (Hatch, 1983; Geschwind, 1979), the cur- rent models of the "speaking" or "writing" brain involve many other areas in the coding, storing, and encoding of a language, e.g., the cerebellum, the function of which is to "smooth out," to put a kind of finishing touch to the complicated sequence of motor activities required by writing or speaking. But the details of the how and where of language storing remain, for unilinguals as for polyglots, a near mys- tery. Where in one's memory is the word 'cat' and the image of a cat, where is the word 'chat' and the ?mage of a 'chat' stored? How do we gain access to the right codes? Some neurophysiologists and psy- chologists have theorized that languages, no matter how many, are stored in a single "container." Others have proposed explanations based on the assump- tion of more or less separate containers for different languages. If?as hypothesized by Penfield and Roberts in 1959?access to the two languages of a bilingual is controlled by a single switch that blocks one language out while the other is processed, then the two languages of a bilingual, in whatever area of the brain they are located, would not interfere with one another. Bilingualism would not have an interfer- ence cost in addition to those for acquisition and storage. The languages would be juxtaposed rather than mixed, and the brain would thus be a kind of Switzerland rather than a kind of Finland (Laponce 1975, 1984a). The single switch theory fails, how- ever, to account for the fact that the two languages of a "balanced" (near perfect) bilingual typically interfere with each other. The experimental evidence produced since Penfield and Roberts formulated their single-switch theory, has led to another expla- nation of the bilingual memory, the tag theory, according to which the codes are grouped primarily by meaning and "tagged" by descriptors that define their commonality and their individual specificity. The code cat would thus have, among its many tags, one that would express its belonging to the English language while chat would have a French tag. Reviewing the literature on the bilingual memory, Barnett (1977) found only 5 studies supporting the single-switch theory while 13 supported the tag theory and 3 proposed a compromise, according to which the bilingual memory is organized primarily according to meaning and secondarily according to language. The tag theory and its modified varieties account better for the fact that the two languages of a bilingual interfere with each other at the level of vocabulary as well as that of syntax. Furthermore, even if the single-switch theory were to make a comeback (which seems unlikely on the basis of contemporary evidence), the shifting from one lan- guage to another would still not be free of cost. Experiments by Kolers (1966), Macnamara (1968), and Marsh and Maki (1976) show that a language shift in mid-communication causes delays, as does the non-congruence between the language of en- coding and that of decoding. Generally, unilingual coding and encoding, hence unilingual social set- tings, offer quicker, more effective means of commu- nication. The Hierarchy of Effectiveness of a Bilingual's Languages Can one possibly be a perfect bilingual? In theory this is possible and would be more likely if the single-switch theory were to be verified. In practice, bilingualism remains an ideal that a few, very few, come close to reaching but from which most people remain markedly distant, even those considered perfect by the less proficient. It is normally very easy to distinguish the dominant from the second lan- guage of a subject: a series of simple experiments by Dornic (1975) show that the reaction time of bilinguals, asked to resolve problems of increasing complexity, does not produce parallel curves; the greater the difficulty, the greater the magnitude of the difference in reaction time between the first and the second language. Those who had appeared to be almost perfect bilinguals on simple tasks, were, on complex problems, at a marked disadvantage in their second language. This explains the apparently paradoxical fact that the people most frustrated by bilingual situations are often those who appear to have an excellent command of their second lan- guage rather than those who do not. Those most frustrated are those who experience a sharp decline in efficiency as tasks become more difficult, while the less proficient experience and expect that lesser efficiency from the very start. The Dornic experiment explains also why linguistic conflicts are so often elite conflicts. The linguistic demands made on an upper-echelon civil servant or corporate executive are not of the same nature as those that confront a hotel-porter or a customer at a local market. A slight hesitation, a lack of words by which to qualify a statement, a lesser fluency that discourages active participation in a complicated debate have, for the former, consequences not contemplated by nor vis- ited on the latter.</page><page sequence="5">7 The Cost Benefit Approach to the Study of Bilingualism Obviously, learning two languages is more costly than learning only one, costly in terms of time and energy. But the cost cannot be measured with any precision, possibly because of the wide variety of individual linguistic abilities, social settings, and linguistic thresholds, which, once reached, satisfy the individual learner and those with whom that learner interacts.6 But, even if we cannot say how long it takes to learn a foreign language any more than we can say how long it takes to become a pianist, we know that the time and the energy costs are high even when the two languages are learned by the child in a bilingual family where each parent speaks a different language. The cost of learning to speak is much reduced by the one parent-one language system, but the cost of learning to read and write remains high. One does not learn a language easily; there is, even for the most gifted, a considerable learning time that rests in the unavoid- able constraints that our neurophysiology puts in the way of polyglotism. Indeed, for most people, lan- guage acquisition is among the most complex tasks one will ever perform. Whether it takes six months, one year, two years or more to learn a foreign language, the neurophysiological "wiring" and "re- wiring" required are a considerable obstacle to inter- language mobility. The benefits we derive from multilingualism are primarily social, and derive from interactions that would not have been possible otherwise. But, are there, in addition, advantages of a non-social kind? The literature on the subject identifies one such major advantage, studied in detail by Leopold (1939- 49) and verified by subsequent experiments (for example: Landry, 1972; Skutnabb-Kangas, 1976; Bain and Yu, 1978; Okoh, 1980): bilingualism facili- tates the dissociation of the signified from the signifier (divergent thinking). The Peal and Lambert study of 1962 and its numerous replications have also shown that bilingual children taught in their second language in immersion schools did not suffer academically, as was generally assumed in the 1920s and 30s. On the contrary, possibly because of the Leopold effect?the dissociation of signifier and signified?they were often analytically ahead of the monolingual control groups. But this psychological advantage is a biproduct of bilingual learning rather than a cause of it. It would violate common sense to expect that we learn other languages for the sake of detaching the word from the idea, the thing, the person, or the animal it stands for. In short, does the neuropsychological literature give us any secure underpinnings that would enable us to build a series of explanations leading from the biological to the psychological and from the latter to the geographical and the political? Let us return to our original questions. Is there evidence that the bilingual brain is different from the unilingual? Find- ings are inconclusive, but have produced some fascinating hypotheses that keep the question open. Does the mind operate as effectively with two as with one linguistic code? The answer must be qualified. Learning a second language appears to facilitate the development, in the child, of his or her analytical abilities, but the use of a second rather than the dominant language puts one at a disadvan- tage because of interferences and delayed reaction times. Could one write the equation giving the summation of these pluses and minuses? Not out of a specific context; even in context it would be remarkably difficult. However, among the findings encountered in our search for neuropsychological explanations of the tendency of language groups to form compact territorial niches, two stand out as likely links between the neuropsychological and the sociological: first, the Dornic, Kolers, Macnamara, Marsh, and Maki types of experiment, which show subjects to be increasingly inefficient in their second language as the tasks become more complicated; second, the experiments showing that a language shift in mid-communication causes delays in reac- tion time. Communicating less efficiently is better than not communicating at all, but communicating efficiently should be expected to be preferred. The Geographical and Political Consequences If using a second language is inefficient as well as high in learning cost, it should follow that people will want to dispense with that language. Their behavior indicates that this is precisely what they do. A few individuals will, of course, acquire foreign lan- guages, even in the absence of economic or social benefits, for the sole pleasure of reaching and penetrating a foreign culture. They are like solitary explorers, and are the exception. Most people have no particular desire to face the hardships of second language learning. The many daily choices of indi- viduals who prefer living among their own linguistic kind result in societies organizing themselves in such a way as to form unilingual homogeneous areas. But, if the cost and the inefficiency of bilin- gualism push toward monolingualism, other forces, economic and political in particular, often lead in the other direction. As a result of these contradictory pulls, societies seek a balance point, that of mini- mum bilingualism. That minimum is obtained, typi- cally, in two major ways: by specializing bilingual communication?through an elite or a group of professional translators for example?and by asym- metrical bilingualism, whereby the dominant group typically remains unilingual, while the ethnic groups</page><page sequence="6">8 of lower status and power assume the learning costs of bilingualism. When two languages come into social and geo- graphical contact, one of three major outcomes will prevail: (a) The languages coexist throughout the population, are known by all, but are segregated by individual and social roles (diglossia); (b) The lan- guages cover all social roles (bilingualism without diglossia) but separate themselves territorially (bilin- gualism by juxtaposition of unilingual areas), and; (c) The languages, as in (b)t cover all social roles but are mixed territorially In this case, either of two solutions will emerge: either the two languages will merge into a single new language (creole) or one language will establish its dominance, relegating bilingualism to the dominated group, and, at longer term, eliminating the weaker language altogether. a) Digiossia. A common example of diglossia is in the coexistence within a given society of a "high" and a "low" variety of the language, such as in Germany, Luxemburg, Switzerland, and the Alsace. The two languages often have some resemblance to each other, a resemblance due to common historical roots, but they may have diverged so as not to be mutually understandable, or at least not easily com- prehensible. Typically, the high language is stan- dardized and written and covers a wide geographi- cal area, while the low form is non-standardized, non-written, and specific to a small geographical entity. One is the language of high-culture and official communication, the other the language of the family, the village, and even, sometimes, of local political institutions. This bilingualism by role-segre- gation is relatively stable over time. Its cost finds its justification in the desire of a group to maintain its distinctiveness and identity by means of linguistic markers. Interference is reduced by the fact that the languages in contact, not having the same social functions, are not used in the same social situations. But stable as it may be, this form of language coexistence does not escape the effect of the tendency to simplify and improve communication by means of unilingualism. The amount of communica- tion occurring in either of the two languages and the hierarchy of the roles to which the languages are attached (the relative importance of work and family for example) explain an evolution which is, in an industrial, highly mobile society, favorable to the standardized language rather than to the local dia- lect. b) Biiinguaiism by territorial segregation. If two languages cover all social roles, if what could be expressed in one language can also be expressed in the other, the two languages are redundant. That is the case of French and English in Canada, Afrikaans and English in South Africa, Finnish and Swedish in Finland. Since we can assume, from the studies of bilingual communication and problem solving men- tioned above, that nearly every bilingual has a dominant language, the redundancy is not, however, absolute. If one's second language is used in com- munication, one is put at a disadvantage. The inequality between languages thus becomes trans- lated into social and political hierarchies; the choice of language is an affirmation of one's power. To avoid these hierarchical conflicts, one may seek to reduce the number of times communication will occur among individuals who do not have the same dominant language. In pre-industrial societies, when life is centered on villages isolated from one another, though relatively close geographically, the territorial mixing of languages can be as intricate as the mixing of religions in Lebanon. In industrial socie- ties, however, separating bilingual communities ac- cording to their dominant language means, in effect, the juxtaposition of linguistic groups that each have distinct geographical core areas where the need for bilingualism is reduced, where the distance be- tween the dominant and the second language is increased, where, in short, each language is territori- ally secure. The result of such territorial segregation is to reduce the need for individual bilingualism. Typically, bilingualism is concentrated, then, at the elite level while the masses remain or become unilingual. Such is the case in Belgium and Switzer- land where the existing territorial segregation of the languages in contact is reinforced by legislation. c1) The merger of languages. Simplification by the merger of two or more languages into a new lan- guage that evolves as a kind of compromise is evident not only in recently created cre?les such as those spoken in Haiti or Papua-New Guinea, but in all major standardized languages, such as those born from the encounter of Latin and Frankish dialects. When the contact is between spoken rather than written languages, the merger will occur more rapidly since, even after the advent of the tape recorder, the sound of a language is not as easily regulated as its written form. But when two written languages come into contact?as more languages have become standardized, the number of such occurrences has increased in the last century?the solution of simplification by merger becomes more difficult and less likely to be achieved. In such cases the solution is more likely to be of the b) or c2) variety. c2) Asymmetrical bilingualism. If populations of a modern state speaking two different languages are mixed territorially, bilingualism is likely to be wide- spread. Redundancy is unavoidable unless the two populations are socially segregated. But, since re- dundancy is costly in learning time and since it is less effective to use a lesser known language, the dominant group will typically shift the cost of addi- tional language learning to the less powerful ethnic</page><page sequence="7">9 group. English Canadians are less likely to know French than French Canadians to know English; Japanese businessmen are more likely to know English than their American counterparts to know Japanese; and, in the Cameroon, the anglophone minority is more likely to know French than the francophone dominant group to know English. South Africa may seem to be an exception, since the politically dominated group is less likely to know the language of the politically dominant ethnicity than vice versa. This apparent exception can however by explained by the fact that the two official languages ?Afrikaans and English?do not have the same power of international communication and also by the fact that the ethnic group which now dominates the political system achieved that dominance little more than one generation ago. It is by means of asymmetrical bilingualism that multilingual Western societies such as France have become unilingual; it is also by such means that the Soviet Union, much more slowly, moves in the same direction. Conclusion In summary, the neuropsychological evidence on the bilingual brain, inconclusive as yet in pinpointing biological differences between the bilingual and the unilingual, occasionally reinforces (in its findings on learning costs, interferences, and differences in re- action time) what common observation tells us. The costs of learning, storing, maintaining, and using two languages contribute to the tendency of lan- guage groups to form cohesive territorial units: a geographical phenomenon of fundamental political importance since the ethno-linguistic communities so bounded in space often want to control the boundaries that separate them. Notes 1. For the distinction between compound and coor- dinate bilingualism, see among others Fergusson (1950), and Fishman (1967). In a coordinate system each term refers to its own signified; in a compound system, two signifiers refer to the same signified. In a coordinate system the two languages are not truly synonymous, each term having its own distinctive context and association of ideas, hence its own meaning?in the Osgood sense of 'meaning' (Os- good, 1957). 2. The age at which a language is learned was, however, found to be a significant variable. 3. To avoid repetition I shall henceforth say "bilin- gual" where I should say "bilingual and multil- ingual." 4. They also tested the factor "proficiency" that appeared unrelated to the explanation. 5. Along similar lines, see studies of the laterally effect of pictorial and nonpictorial languages; for example Nguy et al. (1980) and Endo et al. (1981). 6. According to the Foreign Service Institute of the U.S. Department of State, elementary proficiency (the ability to satisfy routine travel requests and minimum courtesy requirements) in an easy lan- guage (such as French for an anglophone) requires 220 hours of training while the next level (limited work requirement) requires 700 hours.</page><page sequence="8">10 COMMENTARIES THE SOCIOBIOLOGY OF ETHNOLINGUISTIC NUCLEATION William F. Mackey International Center for Research on Bilingualism Laval University Quebec, Canada The implications of Laponce's article on which I should like to comment have to do with the notion of ethnolinguistic nucleation in relation to the concept of diglossia, the Whorf/Sapir hypothesis, the idea of a standard language, and finally, the uses of linguis- tic anthropomorphism. As a species, human beings are highly interde- pendent, especially during the period from birth to puberty. Interdependence depends on intercommu- nication, the means of which may perhaps be im- printed in the genes, very much as it is in other animals?birds, bees, and ants in particular?whose sociology has been studied (Wilson, 1975). If the need to communicate is indeed imprinted in man, so too must be the ability both to adapt to contexts of communication and to differentiate between ways of communicating?with infants, toddlers, adoles- cents, and adults?between kith and kin, family and neighbors, locals and strangers. This sociobiological need to communicate presumes an ability to acquire an understanding of ways of speech different from one's own and an ability to adapt one's way of speaking in order to make oneself understood by others, including speakers of other dialects and other languages. Communication depends on speech, which is ex- pressed most effectively in a language, but not necessary a single language nor even the same language. In areas of the world (Central Africa and Papua-New Guinea, for example) where the political state has not yet established its control over lan- guage boundaries, the people living in the wide zones between two language groups may communi- cate in a changing continuum of mutually modifying practices (Tabouret-Keller, 1978). The same is true for areas of mixed speech. Nor do two people necessarily inter-communicate in the same lan- guage. In immigrant and aboriginal families, the second generation have been known to speak the community language at home in response to parents who use only the ethnic tongue. What is fundamental to all societies is the ability to make oneself understood and to understand. That is why there is no society without speech and no speech without society. As societies evolved from kin-oriented clans to peasant villages to industrial communities to urban- ized nation-states, the need to talk differently to different people has increased. Part of the reason is the evolution from simple primitive settlements where each person did all things, to societies where different people did different things. Some grew food, others baked bread, others built houses, and still others made clothes. As a result of this special- ization, a fraction of the people supplied one of the needs of all the people. Today in some parts of the world that fraction is very small indeed; in Canada and the United States for example, only 3 percent of the people produce 100 percent of the food con- sumed. And within the food-producing population only one type of food is produced by each sub- group. It is the same for the other needs and desires of populations living in modern industrialized socie- ties; the number of types of people with whom one</page><page sequence="9">11 could have contact, either by choice or by necessity, can be considerable. In a modern city, the options exceed the capacity of any individual. The choice depends not only on individual needs, but also on taste, belief, habit, and tradition. In the multiethnic city, an individual can belong to one society for one activity (e.g., music) and to another for another activity (e.g., sports, work, schooling, or religion). In each case there may be some adaptation by the individual of what is communicated and how; this may be a matter of vocabulary, collocation, dialect, or language. Since the turn of the century, the rate of drift to cities has accelerated. More and more of the world's population is moving to larger and larger cities. In 1950, according to the United Nations Foundation for Population Studies, about half the world's popu- lation lived in cities; by the end of the century this figure will have risen to the three-quarter mark. At the same time, people who move to big cities are coming from further and further away, from lands where the types of speech and language are differ- ent from those of the original inhabitants. In the process, cities are becoming not only multisocial but also multilingual in their demographic make-up. Al- ready, the second largest Mexican city is outside of Mexico, in Los Angeles county. Miami is the second largest Cuban city. The largest Puerto Rican city is New York. Other language groups in this multilingual megapolis are large enough to populate each of them a number of sizable cities. The same can be said for London, Paris, Singapore, Rio, or Buenos Aires. In London, children in the schools speak a hundred different home languages. Although people who settle in such cities seek out those who understand them best, they cannot avoid contact with those who speak languages other than their own. The very structure of modern society, based on the interdependence brought about by the division of labor, attenuates the effects of any lin- guistic nucleation which may exist. New citizens must be able to adapt in order to survive; they must understand other forms of speech or become bilin- gual to a degree that satisfies their needs. How bilingual depends on what they do (Mackey, 1976a). This development raises the question of linguistic territoriality as a basic component of human society. Is language territorial because people speaking the same language will want to live together, or do people who live together tend to develop a common language? Take English for example. From the early to the late Middle Ages, several waves of invading peoples brought different languages to Great Brit- ain, adding layer upon layer to the Keltic substra- tum. These invaders did develop a common lan- guage, quite distinct from the Anglo-Saxon on which it was based. Had this not happened, modern "English" would have developed in a totally different way. In place of the, to us, familiar expressions of French and Latin origin, like "the remorse of con- science" we would perhaps have the more Ger- manic "the afterbite of inwit." From a post-conquest basis of some twenty thou- sand positions of control throughout the realm, the Norman invaders of England multiplied into a French-speaking elite which controlled all the institu- tions of the state. We must conclude that, during the three centuries that Anglo-Norman French was the official language, the Anglo-Saxons, in accommodat- ing to their Norman overlords, developed a new language. The result of this accommodation is one of the most extensive cre?les that has ever devel- oped: Early Modern English. On the other hand, there also seems to be plenty of evidence to illustrate the dictum regarding birds of a feather, as studies of the linguistic nucleation of immigrants in the new world have attested. The extent to which this happens, however, seems to depend on the degree of ethnicity which has been programmed into the culture. Italian communities abound in the new world to a greater extent than German ones, although the total population of immi- grants of German origin is greater. Another factor affecting linguistic nucleation is mobility, the incidence of which seems to have increased to beyond the 25 percent level attributed to the United States in the 1950s (Packard, 1974). Not only are more and more people moving further and further away from their place of birth, they are doing so more and more often. It has also spread abroad to Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia, Japan in particular, with the result that more and more people are having to adapt more and more often. This constant need to adapt by so many different people has seemingly produced a rising incidence of the multiple personality syndrome. Only a small fraction of those affected become pathological cases which require and arouse attention. Many of these, however, have linguistic implications, such as the case of the "unilingual" Detroiter one of whose many personalities was a Serbo-Croatian speaking Yugoslav with the accent of the Gypsy immigrants with whom he had lived in Florida. Since the publica- tion of "The Three Faces of Eve" and the more recent "I am Eve," some people, living in big cities have been found to operate, normally and unobtru- sively, with several?some claim dozens?of dis- crete and distinct personalities. Whether our genes are directly or indirectly responsible for this develop- ment, the growing literature on multiple personalities illustrates that human behavior, including language behavior, can be conditioned to function restrictively within the limits of one of the several personalities of the same person. Recent research into multiple</page><page sequence="10">12 personality seems to confirm what multilingual per- sons have often claimed, that is, that they change personalities when they change languages. The reason why so much of this research has escaped popular notice is that multiple personality only be- comes evident when it creates problems or be- comes pathological (Wolfson, 1970). In the field of ethnopsychiatry, tetraglossia is considered normal, since much of the world population distinguishes between vernacular, vehicular, referential, and myth- ical speech functions (Gobard, 1976). In sum, a sub-population of diglossie bilinguals with multiple personalities living in the ever-chang- ing multilingual megapolis, is a manifestation of the evolution of the adaptive communicative need of mankind imprinted in the human species. Diglossia is simply the consequence of this adaptation. It is an extension of the notion of compatible and appropri- ate behavior. A person may be polite as a car driver but aggressive as a business man, or vice-versa. Because we are all diglossie and disocial we must be to a certain extent bidialectal and even bilingual. Therefore, diglossia?speaking differently to dif- ferent sorts of people for different occasions- seems to be a fundamental corollary of the sociobi- ology of language. It became institutionalized long ago, in the early city states, and was referred to in the literature of Ancient Greece. The word itself is of Greek origin; it became popular among the French Hellenists of the latter part of the 19th century who used the term diglossie to describe the distribution of the uses of the two dialects of Modern Greek. Ferguson (1959) found completely parallel cases in other communities, described them and elaborated his much-quoted typology. Since then, the concept and the term has been greatly expanded to include the uses of any language and any dialect in comple- mentary sociolinguistic distribution, regardless of number, covering the use of three, four, or more languages in the same community (triglossia, te- traglossia, or generally, polyglossia)(Mackey, forth- coming). The initial dichotomy between the spoken language and the written language is no longer the basic distinction, since cases have been located where each has its own spectrum of domains, to the extent that different types of "literary" diglossia have been described (Mackey, 1976b). One of the consequences of diglossia is that it produces interference between the two codes. When concepts usually coded and dealt with in one language are expressed in speech or writing in the other language, the former intrudes on the latter and we find elements of one language in the text of the other (Mackey, 1983a). Interlingual interference can be explained by dif- ferences in degrees of availability. Language ele- ments that are most accessible in the memory will be used first. If there are more, or more recent, expressions in one language, those expressions will come first to mind even though the other language is being used at the time. A bilingual speaking in his home language about the work he does in another language, is likely to interlard his speech with words from his language of work. Since situations are continually changing, so is the degree of availability of concepts which code and record them. The variation of availability with the seasons has been quantified (Mackey, 1982). When two or more languages are involved, the balance of dominance can change, since the diglos- sie distributions are not likely to be either identical or equal in weight. In describing bilingualism, terms such as "perfect" and "balanced" do not fit well as descriptions of a phenomenon which is by its nature unstable (Mackey, 1958). If a person is bilingual today under one set of circumstances that does not mean that he or she will be equally bilingual tomor- row under a different set of circumstances (Frances- cato, 1981). In this context, the storage of language units in the brain appears to be not so much an either/or proposition, nor a question of how many, but of how long, how deep, and how often. In other words, it is a question of degree of availability. Research into human potential in Philadelphia seems to indicate that only a tiny fraction of the billions of storage cells of the brain are ever used in one lifetime; people have been known to store more than a dozen languages. There is little evidence that the capacity is limited to one hemisphere or that multilinguals are obliged to switch to the other hemisphere. Nor is there any convincing argument to support the exis- tence of a dichotomy between the East and the West, corresponding to the right and left hemi- spheres. The experience of Europeans born and raised in highly different cultures (Greenland and China) would seem to invalidate the hypothesis of Tsunoda, Rogers, and associates. As early as 1922, Jesperson had noted that children of Danish officials in Greenland learned Eskimo first and better than they learned Danish. In the last analysis, it might well be that both hemispheres are involved and that the genesis of language in the brain might indeed come from the right. If postnatal crying evolves eventually into infant speech, it is possible that language learning develops from an emotional rather than intellectual (rule-governed) basis. In fact, suc- cessful language learners have often remarked that they have developed a "feeling" for the language. If the theories of Tsunoda, Rogers, and associates were to prove correct, this would indeed, as Laponce has pointed out, give a biological underpin- ning to the Whorf/Sapir hypothesis. But this hypoth- esis itself is questionable. One could argue that the</page><page sequence="11">13 hypothesis is self-confirming. It was imagined in English, a language in which the distinction between language as code and language as discourse has long remained uncoded, as it were, in everyday speech. If the hypothesis had been imagined in French, one would have had to decide whether the reference was to the generic (F. language) or the specific (F. langue): if it were the latter?not lan- guage, but a language?that had been the referent, a further distinction could have been called for in French between language (F. tangue) as code and language (F. parole) as message or discourse (Mackey, 1985). This is simply one example of the linguistic relativ- ity which is the foundation of the Whorf/Sapir hy- pothesis. The concept of linguistic relativity derives from the realization that all language signs (words and structures) are basically arbitrary, and that the human species evolved as isolated peoples in differ- ent environments, hence the encoding of observable reality through language could not possibly have been identical for all mankind. Different peoples used their language to dissect and classify the significant features of their environment and to record their cumulative experience in their culture. My own ongoing research into the cross-cultural relativity of conceptual universes has provided plenty of data in support of the existence of linguis- tic and cultural relativity. This research includes concept categories elicited through controlled asso- ciation tests given in areas of the world as different and as distant as Equatorial Africa and Artie America. For example, in the Basa language of the Cameroon, the tests elicited no word for the concept of snow; but in the Inuktituk language of the High Arctic, our tests elicited dozens of words for this concept. According to my collaborator, the Es- kimologist Dermot Collis, some eighty such words have been identified, a dozen of which are in current use (Mackey, 1972). It seems to me that the evi- dence of linguistic relativity, the categorization through language (lexicon and grammar) of observ- able reality and experience, is so obvious and overwhelming that the phenomenon can hardly be called a hypothesis. The other side of the Whorf/Sapir hypothesis, however, is something else. It says that linguistic relativity results in linguistic determinism, that is, that we can express only what is coded in our language, that we are all prisoners of our native tongue, unable to express concepts for which we have no words. This part of the hypothesis is tenable only if one fails to distinguish between language as code and language as speech. French, for example, does not code the distinction between inside and outside barriers; a single word (porte) covers both the concept of "door" and that of "gate" in English. Any French speaker can make the distinction with an appropriate modifier (int?rieure or ext?rieure) if the need arises, but it rarely does. And this leads us to a further fallacy inherent in the Whorf/Sapir hypothesis of determinism. It comes from an addi- tional theoretical confusion between code and con- text. Hypothetical^, it goes something like this: "since meaning is coded in the language, the code determines our options for the expression of our meanings." Meaning, however, is not in the code, it's in the context. According to the conceptual theory of meaning, our language is simply a tool which helps us express what we mean (Ogden and Richards, 1923). In sum, the Whorf/Sapir hypothesis is a double- barrelled one. The first barrel holds the self-evident assertion that all language categories are relative; the second carries the contention that, because of this, our minds are prisoners of our language. If we dare look straight into both barrels, we see that the first fires only blanks and the second doesn't fire at all. The idea of linguistic determinism has attracted scholars for two generations; it has been a fascinat- ing notion, but it does not hold up under analysis. In the same category of untenable assertions about multilinguals (most of them generated by unilinguals), we have to place the often-quoted compound-coordinate distinction. It came as a sur- prise to introspective bilinguals (like Macnamara, Haugen, and Andersson) that they must be either coordinate or compound. As a bilingual, Laponce does well to question this theoretical dichotomy. The history of the idea goes back to an obvious and perfectly valid distinction made by Weinreich whereby a word in one language can be associated with a word in another language and consequently with its dictionary meaning; or each of these words can be associated separately with the concept category which forms part of the semantic system of the language to which the word belongs. The first type of association is more frequent among students of a language, especially people who learn lan- guages in school; the second type of association is more typical of bilinguals who use two languages functionally. Once language learners become fluent in the second language, however, their patterns of association simply have to conform to those of the bilingual, otherwise they cannot function in their new language. As more of their associations change from compound to coordinate, they tend to become more bilingual (Mackey, 1983b). A third notion which comes out in Laponce's article, is that of the standard language. To begin with, I would contend that the concept of a language (F. tangue), is itself an abstract construct of society. In isolated primitive societies, people are either able to speak or they are not. It is contact with other</page><page sequence="12">14 forms of speech that obliges people to make the distinction between one language and another; only since the sixties has the expression "the Japanese language" become current in Japan, as a result of a generation of contact with the languages of the world. The child has no notion of language until he is taught it. Even bilingual children have no notion of speaking two different languages until forced to develop the distinction. They may simply speak one way to their mother and another way to their father (Schmidt-Mackey, 1977). As Laponce points out, a single standardized language is a highly efficient instrument in the hands of the modern state, whose population has become so highly mobile. If this language can be called "the mother tongue," it takes on quasi-biological associations. This concept of mother tongue is essentially a political notion. It is of fairly recent vintage, the fruit of sectarian and political conflict going back to the Reformation (Wycliffe was one of the first to use the expression), the polemics of which seemed to place the national standardized language firmly on the side of mother- hood. Since no national language has ever been standardized in the home?let alone by any mother ?this highly formalized written version of the speech used at the seat of power was far removed from the local vernacular of the vast majority of the population, most of whom were illiterate. The ability of the state to impose a language depends on several factors: demographic, economic, and cul- tural (Mackey, 1976b). In most areas where several dialects or languages were spoken, the notion of the mother tongue has had little consensus, especially where it is supposed to be identical with the national language. What are more relevant are distinctions made possible through concepts like home lan- guages, vernacular languages, vehicular languages, official languages, national languages, school lan- guages (Mackey, 1984). Yet most nation states have used the notion? sometimes the fiction?of "mother tongue" for politi- cal purposes. No two nations, it seems, have used exactly the same definition, although the term is used in the national census of many countries (Kloss and McConnell, 1974-1984) The "mother tongue" has become the basis of national education and even of psychological research, based on the prem- ise that every normal child must have a mother tongue, and that this language should be used as a basis for national schooling, administration, law, and politics. It is not surprising that as the state in many parts of the world assumes more and more responsi- bility for the destiny of its citizens, the national tongue as a means of controlling this destiny has likewise come under the control of the state (Mackey, forthcoming). My final comment has to do with the opening sentence of Laponce's article, an example of what I have called "linguistic anthropomorphism," whereby the national language seems to take on a life of its own in the minds of those who write about it. This concept of the national language became part of the conceptual arsenal of the militants of political Romanticism during the latter part of the nineteenth century. It was adopted by the compara- tive philologists of the period in the context of the theory of the evolution of biological species. Like living organisms, languages are born, evolve, and die. Language species can therefore be protected, enriched, purified, defended, and cherished, like any valued creature. To state that "by concentrating their speakers in physical space, languages in- crease their chances of surviving, prospering, and assimilating the competitors that enter their midst. . . " is to assume that languages are ana- logues of organisms rather than simply patterns of human behavior (Mackey, 1983c). THINKING ABOUT THE OPTIMAL NUMBER OF LANGUAGES Jonathan Pool Department of Political Science University of Washington Seattle, Washington 98195 When we think back over the imaginative and persuasive argument that Jean Laponce has made for the high costs of keeping several languages in one brain or in one society, we are tempted to ask ourselves a useful question: Why should there be more than one language in the world? If you were fortunate enough to be engineering a new world, complete with people and computers of your own design, would you want to outfit that world with more than a single language? Should the new world's people have the capability of using more than one language? Should their computers be programmable in more than one language?</page><page sequence="13">15 Pros and Cons of Linguistic Multiplicity We can start by extracting from Laponce's discus- sion some benefits and costs of linguistic multiplic- ity. A multiplicity of languages within the same territory or brain?or both?is beneficial because: 1. it facilitates analytical thinking, and 2. it helps groups maintain distinctiveness from other groups. On the other hand, linguistic multiplicity is detri- mental because: 1. it decreases the probability of mutual intelligibil- ity; 2. it attaches high learning costs to the achieve- ment of mutual intelligibility; 3. it requires, under some conditions, switching between languages, which slows thinking and com- munication; 4. it requires, under some conditions, the use of a language one does not know well, which impairs performance and satisfaction; and 5. it helps groups exercise power over other groups. Just listing the pros and cons this way makes it obvious that one engineer's benefit is another's cost, and that I have arbitrarily assumed that: (1) you want a world in which people can divide themselves into distinct groups but cannot use language to exploit other groups; (2) you want to minimize learning costs; (3) you want to maximize cognitive and communicative efficiency; and (4) you want to promote analytical thinking. If these assumptions are valid, it looks as if the reasons against linguistic multiplicity far outweigh those favoring it, at least if each reason is worth the same amount of consideration. So presumably you should design your world, its people, and their computers to be unilingual. Or should you? It's time to reveal a secret: Laponce hasn't given us all the benefits and costs. That is eminently excusable, since I am asking a somewhat different question from Laponce, and in any case no one can enumerate all the effects of a variable. But precisely for this reason we might ask ourselves whether there are any important pros and cons Laponce has omitted that it would be interest- ing to take into account. In this commentary I shall try to rectify what I see as an imbalance in Laponce's article by confining myself to omitted considerations that favor linguistic multiplicity. Omitted Consideration 1 ft takes work to maintain linguistic uniformity once it has been created. Languages maintain their homo- geneity only with shared use. If (to use a minimal case) persons A, B, C, and D all use a language to communicate among themselves and then A and ? split off from C and D, eventually the language used by A and ? will be mutually unintelligible with the one used by C and D. Languages naturally and continually change, both within and across genera- tions. Within broad limits presumably imposed by biology and the facts of the world, changes in languages can be assumed to be a random walk. The probability of the two halves of a split language changing in the same ways in the absence of coordination is negligible. The work required to keep the A-B language mutually intelligible with the C-D language is a cost of linguistic uniformity. If A and ? never communi- cate with C and D, this cost yields no return. But even if some communication does take place be- tween A or ? and C or D, the benefit of mutual intelligibility is not necessarily worth the cost of keeping the languages alike. As Laponce suggests, language learning and translation are alternatives. Their costs (including the burdens imposed by use of a non-native language) may be lower than the cost of uniformity maintenance. Omitted Consideration 2 Different languages are better for different purposes. Once we decide to view languages ?nstrumentally, it is naive to assume that languages are used to achieve one, and only one, homogeneous purpose, such as "thinking/communicating." We might as well assume that surgical instruments serve the single purpose of "operating." Instruments which do everything don't do any one thing as well as special- ized instruments, and this principle holds for lan- guages as much as for anything else, even though its applicability to languages is not widely recog- nized. The better someone knows two languages, the less likely he is to claim that anything can be said equally well in both of them. As Skvorecky (1985) puts it, "Every language is rich, but rich in its own way." Those of us who communicate with computers should appreciate the benefits of linguistic multiplic- ity for efficient purposive action. A language well suited to telling a computer to perform matrix alge- bra operations is not the same as one well suited for telling a computer to format a manuscript. Even within one of these categories there are grounds for maintaining specialized languages. In one kind of word-processing language (such as that used to typeset Politics and the Life Sciences), a formatting instruction is given by including a special character sequence in the text. In another (such as the one I am using to compose this comment), a formatting instruction is given (typically) by pointing on a video</page><page sequence="14">16 screen to the passage to be affected and then to a label describing the action to be performed on that passage. These languages have different compara- tive advantages. One is better for global search-and- replace operations and for composing plain text. The other is better for frequent review of what has already been composed and for mixing text and graphics. A third language, one combining all the capabilities of both of the first two, would be more versatile, but it would also be more expensive in its use of the computer's resources and would take longer for the user to learn and for the computer to obey instructions in. Persons who want to do something that requires using a language need to choose a language. If it is true that languages have specialized utility, then there may be a "best" language for what these persons want to do. But they may not yet know that language. Should they learn it? If they acquire an appropriate amount of competence in it and use it often enough, their learning cost may be more than repaid with the increased effectiveness with which their new language achieves their purpose, even taking into account the difficulty they have using it relative to what would have been the case if it had been their native language. Likewise, if you know only BASIC and you want to write artificial-intelli- gence programs, you may decide that you are better off investing some time to learn LISP than plowing ahead in BASIC. As of yet, we know little about which natural languages are best for what. Some have argued that French is a good language for diplomacy, English for democratic thought, and Hopi for theorization in physics. It is obvious, however, that the lexicons of languages are extremely varied in the topics for which they contain specialized vocabularies. Be- cause of this, it is a common phenomenon for a native speaker of language X to find, after being schooled through the medium of language Y, that it is impossible to talk, or even to learn to talk, in his own native language about the subjects he has studied. For any single individual, the cost of provid- ing his native language with a vocabulary for dis- cussing a given subject may exceed the cost of learning another language that already has such a vocabulary. In conversations between persons who both know the same two languages, the practice of "code switching" is often observed. Laponce's discussion would not seem to lead us to expect such alterna- tion between languages within the same conversa- tion and even within the same sentence. Why does it take place? Among the available explanations for code switching are reselection of the most effective language as the purpose changes during the con- versation, and a taste for linguistic variety or sur- prise (analogous, perhaps, to the custom in some languages for speakers to use synonyms rather than repeat a word shortly after its first use). Laponce mentions experiments showing that people react more quickly in single-language conversations than in conversations requiring language alternation. But alternation could be expected to enhance some other purpose that people may have in mind when they converse, such as precision, secrecy, or humor. Omitted Consideration 3 Language learning can be selective. While it is often convenient to make the simplifying assumption that language learning is binary?that a person either knows or doesn't know a language?this assump- tion is clearly untrue, and using it can lead to false behavioral predictions. People can learn bits and pieces of a language, rather than "the whole thing," and they can begin using it shortly after they know the first few bits. In fact, there are millions of persons who know just a few words, phrases, and rules of a language: people who know only how to wait in a restaurant, beg, ask where the cathedral is, or read journal abstracts on hydraulic biology. The cost of acquiring selective semi-competence in a language will typically be substantially lower than the cost of generalized learning. The optimizing learner can be assumed to begin with the pieces for which he has the greatest use and continue learning progressively less useful pieces until the utility of the next piece equals its learning cost. Thus we should expect to find, and we do find throughout the world, people who know how to do certain things with certain languages. Laponce de- scribes situations of functional specialization of lan- guages, but he does not, I think, make it clear that when a language is used by a given speaker for only a particular purpose the cost that speaker incurred to learn that language may have been correspond- ingly low. Omitted Consideration 4 The costs of language learning are interactive. We normally assume, as does Laponce, that it costs more to learn more languages. This assumption may be false. It is well known that an investment in learning how to learn can, under some conditions, more than repay itself in the increased learning effectiveness that it produces. One of the chief methods of learning how to learn, however, is to learn a purposively selected instance of the kind of competence that one wants to learn how to learn. Two common names for this kind of learning invest- ment are the case method and simulation learning. By learning how to analyze an actual case in a law or business school, a student may learn how to analyze later cases so well that the time spent on the study</page><page sequence="15">17 case and the real cases together is less than the real cases would have taken in the absence of the case study. Similar reasoning applies to simulated medi- cal diagnosis, simulated airplane piloting, etc. In the arena of language learning, there is reason to believe that learning a "preparatory" language, under some conditions, constitutes a profitable in- vestment in learning how to learn languages. As such, it makes the learning of some or all subse- quent languages less costly. Research at the Institut f?r Kybernetische P?dagogik at Paderborn, Federal Republic of Germany, has produced tentative evi- dence that the subsequent payoff may be great enough to return, within as little as 3-4 years, the entire cost of learning the first "case study" lan- guage (Pool, 1981). If this is true, then under some conditions learning two languages can actually be less costly than learning the second of them without the first. Omitted Consideration 5 The rate of increase in second-language disadvan- tage as task difficulty rises is language-specific. Laponce notes that the disadvantage suffered by persons using their second language rises as the communicative task they are performing becomes more difficult. He uses this finding, with remarkable insight, to explain the fact that as second-language competence rises, frustration with second-language use also rises. The phenomenon he describes de- pends, however, on the characteristics of the lan- guages involved. If we can find a measure for the "output" of language learning, i.e., how much one is able to do with the competence one has acquired in the language, then we shall find that the ratio of output to input (learning effort) rises and falls as learning progresses, but it rises and falls at different rates for different languages. Undoubtedly, the course of this ratio depends on the languages already known, the language being learned, and various learner characteristics. It is exactly this rate of change in the output-input ratio that differentiates, more than any other effi- ciency-related attribute, natural and non-natural lan- guages as ?deal types. Natural languages, that is, languages that are maintained by bodies of native speakers, are almost impossible for non-native speakers, at least in adult age, to learn to use indistingishably from educated native speakers. Non-natural languages, that is languages that do not have native speakers, can be learned to the existing standard of perfection, because that standard is maintained by the community of persons who have in fact achieved it as second-language learners. Thus, when the speakers of language X and the speakers of language Y use a non-natural language ? for those purposes that require communication across the X-Y boundary, the effect on costs and satisfaction may be much better than what it is when they use language X or Y for this purpose. This is especially true if satisfaction is directly related to the equality of the communicators' competence in the language of communication. Non-natural languages used in communication among humans fall into the categories of classical languages, pidgins, and artificial languages (Stew- art, 1968). From the scanty evidence to date, at least some artificial languages have been designed whose learning cost per unit of output rises much less steeply, or falls much more steeply, than the unit learning cost of a typical natural language. Thus the cost to learn an artificial language well enough to read a newspaper article has been reported to be in the neighborhood of one-fifth as great as the cost to acquire the equivalent competence in a natural language. But the cost to learn an artificial language well enough to write an article for a professional journal has been estimated at about one-thirtieth as great as the cost to reach that level in a second natural language (Pool, 1981). Conclusion If one gets the impression from Laponce that analyti- cal intelligence and group identity are the only advantages individuals can reap from living in com- munities where several languages are used, then that impression is premature. It is premature first because Laponce does not in fact make that claim (although he might appear to do so from a quick reading), and second because a number of phenom- ena other than those discussed by Laponce open that view to serious doubt. Laponce's discussion makes an important contri- bution to the debate about how governments should treat languages and their speakers. His essential message appears to be that linguistic segregation may be beneficial and may be the only reasonable alternative to a battle unto death among languages. My reply is that there may be yet other viable alternatives that have not been seriously consid- ered. These include specialized second-language use, selective language learning, language learning enhancement through the study of "case study" languages, and the use of artificial or other non- natural languages for communication among the speakers of different native languages. We have much to learn before we conclude that the unilingual organization of territories, populations, and occupa- tions is the optimal way to deal with communication barriers in a multilingual world.</page><page sequence="16">18 NEUROPSYCHOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE: THE TIME IS NOT YET RIPE FOR BENEFICIAL INTERACTION Harvey Sussman Department of Linguistics The University of Texas at Austin Austin, Texas 78712-1196 In his search for neuropsychological evidence to further substantiate well-known and intuitively obvi- ous sociological accounts of linguistic territoriality, Laponce inadvertently provides an example of the pitfalls that can derive from overly optimistic at- tempts to conduct interdisciplinary investigations. The unsuspecting reader is prepared to learn about "the biological anchors of human behavior," "the constants," "the universal effects," "the secure underpinnings" that will provide a biological collabo- rative verification of the strength of various cultural factors that support the trend towards unilingualism rather than multilingualism in ethnolanguage groups. The supposed underlying differences in modes of language processing that occur in monol- ingual versus bilingual brains is to be translated into political decisions at the national level. Despite the fact that I am a card-carrying neuro- psychologist engaged in exactly the kind of re- search Laponce is investigating for his political science theories on language territoriality, I would be the last person to offer or even to suggest that my laboratory findings be incorporated into govern- mental policy. Behavioral studies in general are characterized by equivocal and often contradictory results. The research investigating language lateral- ly and processing differences in bilingual versus monolingual speakers is especially fraught with fuzzy findings. The fruitlessness of this attempt is apparent early in the paper. Laponce correctly states that after reviewing the literature he found no "firm answers," only "circumstantial evidence" at best. So instead of the hoped for "biological anchors," Laponce turns up flotsam and jetsam. However, and herein lies my principal objection to this endeavor, he goes ahead anyway to offer gran- diose claims as if he did uncover the biological underpinnings of linguistic groups congregating in a given spatial locality: "Neuropsychology may thus be part of the explanation of the tendency of Ian- guage groups to occupy homogeneous territorial areas." In addition to the above mentioned philosophical difference that I have towards this interdisciplinary goal, another related shortcoming arises when a scholar from area A attempts to review the pertinent literature from area B. With the best intentions in mind there still will be misjudgments. In the area of hemispheric lateralization in bilingualism, no scholar would cite Shanon (1982) as the prime source for a comprehensive literature capsulation. Entire chap- ters and books have been published in this area carefully outlining the "caveats" of the research findings. In the same vein, no one in neuro- psychology would reference Hatch (1983) in dis- cussing the role of language cortex (Broca's and Wernicke's areas). From my limited exposure to interdisciplinary articles (especially in the field of education) I have found that very often keynote articles are ignored and the "sensationalist" articles are pounced upon as the coming of the messiah. These "flakey" articles, ignored by the peer group, are overemphasized and used to generate unjusti- fied conclusions. I feel Laponce's article is also guilty of this tendency. Laponce's entire case rests on a few studies: Kolers, 1966; MacNamara, 1968; Marsh and Maki, 1976; and Dornic, 1975. I have never seen any of these studies referenced before in the more than five dozen articles, chapters, books that I have reviewed in the course of my own work. Given the benefit of the doubt that maybe Laponce has found a hidden gem, it remains for him to convince the reader of the merit of these findings. The findings of these collective studies implicate a slower reaction time for bilinguals and a compromised efficiency in language use. No methodological description of the studies (e.g., size of subject group, statistical tests for significance, adequate experimental controls for such crucial variables as handedness, age of L2 acquisition, sex, familial sinistrality, etc.) is provided to enable the reader to judge whether or not these findings are to be taken seriously or not. Without such information we are left to take Laponce's word for the importance of these obscure studies. I'm not quite ready to do this. There are other examples of erroneous coverage of the literature that can be cited. Only one will be mentioned because a study of mine directly contra- dicts Laponce's statement. In the first paragraph of the section entitled "Are Bilinguals Less Lateralized than Unilinguals?" he states that the concept of weaker lateralization in bilinguals compared to monolinguals "finds practically no support in the literature." I realize that the word "practically" is inserted in the sentence, but nevertheless Sussman, Franklin, and Simon (1982) convincingly demon-</page><page sequence="17">19 strated robust lateralization differences between a large group of bilinguals (spanning five different languages plus English) versus a control group of right-handed monolinguals. Whereas the monol- ingual group had significant left hemisphere lateral- ly, the late bilinguals who acquired their second language in adulthood rather than early childhood, evidenced highly symmetric patterns of hemispheric representation for the second language only. This finding has recently been replicated by Green (1985) and has not been replicated by Soares (1982) with a Portuguese-English group. Admittedly there are con- tradictory results, but plenty of support can be found. Too eager to find supportive claims, Laponce shows a tendency to ignore crucial variables (i.e., age of L2 acquisition) or to treat them as "nuisance" variables. This is an important point because it also shows up in his discussion of "costs" of acquiring a second language. Biologically speaking, the differ- ences in language acquisition in childhood versus adulthood is staggering. Language acquisition from infancy is a genetically predestined event that merely requires linguistic exposure/stimulation to reach normal maturational levels. A child, whether acquiring one, two, or three languages, does not undergo a cost analysis. Considering the complexity of natural languages, it is a miracle that children can acquire knowledge of language so effortlessly. Only reading and writing must be learned by the child. Adult second language acquisition is an entirely different situation and Laponce fails to distinguish between the two situations. I for one would love to have my kids grow up in a multilingual environment despite the "chance" that their L2 reaction times might be a tad slower than their L^ performances. Such is the heavy price one pays. Faulty logic also permeates the article. As one example, the issue of whether or not bilinguals are less lateralized for their languages compared to monolinguals is treated. The implication of this difference, if found to be true, is supposedly related to the issue of inefficient or decreased capacity to encode and decode language. Nowhere in the litera- ture is there any evidence to suggest that laterality differences between individuals are translated into poorer language skills. In fact, left-handers, who as a group are more symmetrical or even right hemi- sphere dominant, do not suffer from any language deficiencies compared to their right-handed peers. In conclusion, I feel it is premature to say anything profound concerning any neuropsychological re- search finding and how it might relate or be incorpo- rated into political science theory or practice. If the consensus view of a highly specific issue is not believed by a large segment of researchers within the same area of neuropsychology, how can any conclusions be made that might someday affect the lives of real people? Certain findings emanating from behavioral research laboratories are best kept under wrap, to be circulated among a select group of like- minded researchers, and not publicly disseminated as a guide to national or educational policy-making. THE MULTILINGUAL MIND AND MULTILINGUAL SOCIETIES: A COMMENTARY Warren D. TenHouten Department of Sociology University of California Los Angeles, California 90024 Laponce's essay suggests that languages are terri- torial in two distinct ways. First, language communi- ties tend to become concentrated geographically, in physical space. And second, cortical spaces or "areas" are appropriated for cognitive functions associated with language use. My commentary will be confined to the second use of space, to the biological bases of language and their representa- tions in the brain. Here the spatial metaphor is problematic, as Laponce implicitly uses a zero-sum model of the cortical representation of linguistic functions. He argues that the learning of a second language involves, in addition to time and energy, the commitment of cortical areas. It is as if the learning of a new language could exhaust the space available in the brain for storing, processing, and retrieving linguistic information, so that cortical areas committed to new languages would then become unavailable for other uses. If such a zero-sum model of cortical capacity with respect to language were correct, we might expect that each language an individual learns would be more difficult to master than was the preceeding language, but studies of language learning do not indicate that this is the case.</page><page sequence="18">20 While a limited-capacity model would not seem to apply to language learning, such a model does apply to the concurrent processing of relevant and irrelevant stimuli (see e.g., Johnstone, 1982; and Johnstone, Galin, Fein, Yingling, Herron, and Mar- cus, 1984). There is indeed evidence that the right hemi- sphere is apt to play a significant role in the learning of a second language. The contribution of the right hemisphere is maximized if the learner is pre-adoles- cent and has not yet attained the capability for logical-analytic and propositional thought on an ex- tended scale. Not suprisingly, then, childhood lan- guage-learning is apt to place emphasis on context, pragmatics, and multi-level communication, and is consequently apt to involve the right hemisphere. There is also limited evidence that the right hemisphere is most involved in the learning of a second or higher-order language in the early stages of learning. As a person learns a new language, what is learned only gradually becomes language. Given this process, in which the collection of imper- fectly bounded lexical items and phrases, implicitly known rules, and so forth, are in a process of being organized as a cognitive structure with enough stability in use and memory to qualify as language, the use of or the activation of the right hemisphere does not necessarily mean that language' is bilater- ally represented. In this formative state, what is encoded in memory is not language per se, or language as a reified 'thing', so that where 'it' is represented in the brain may not be answered with any generality beyond case studies of individuals; the cortical representation of a language being learned must change during the learning process. It is evident that any individual learning a new lan- guage will have the involved information 'stored' and 'retrieved' and 'represented' in the brain differently than the first language or mother tongue (Ojemann, 1984). How this happens is subject, no doubt, to a wide variety of individual differences. When presented with a novel situation, such as learning a new language, an individual has to find a way for his or her brain to process the information. If a person is post-adolescent, and well-lateralized, there is apt to be a relatively left-hemisphere dependent approach and a grammar translation methodology. But if a person is pre-adolescent and less well-lateralized, there is apt to be a relatively right-hemisphere dependent approach and an immersion methodol- ogy (Krashen, 1976). Here, in terms of cognitive strategy, brain plasticity means that the options are greater and the probability of bilateral learning strat- egies are therefore enhanced. At least on his metaphorical level, Laponce's conception of language is reificational. Languages are seen as "territorial" and oriented to self-preser- vation. He seeks a biological explanation of this, in the neuropsychological problems associated with learning, and using, a second or higher-order lan- guage; this can be inferred from his statement that "the mind does not operate as effectively if it has to shift from one language to another." An implication of this, which he draws, is that a policy of encourag- ing the learning of other languages could have as costs neurophysiological dysfunctions. The evi- dence in support of this speculation is sparse indeed. He cites as possible costs two marginally relevant items: (1) experimental subjects are in- creasingly inefficient in a second language as tasks become more difficult, and; (2) language shifts in mid-communication result in delayed reaction times. There are other costs he considers that would not seem to have a biological substrate. First, it takes time and energy to learn a new language. And second, in using the new language, one will tend to be at a disadvantage when conversing with a native speaker of the learned language; this statement implicitly assumes such an intentionality of the other, who in fact may rather share the goal of establishing intersubjectivity and communicating meaning. But could there be other neurophysiological and neuropsychological costs involved in learning lan- guages? A point Laponce could have brought up in this connection, but did not, is the possibility that learning a second language could interfere with, or create a deficit in, visuospatial functions. Impaired visuospatial functioning is common among left- handers, whether their left-handedness is pathologi- cal or genetic-environmental. Levy (1969, 1974) attri- butes such deficits to the effects of interference with, or the crowding out of, spatial functions in the right hemisphere. This proposed "crowding" mech- anism of Levy and Landsdell (1969), in the absence of a left-sided brain injury, has not been sustained for "normal" people (see Newcombe and Ratcliff, 1973; Hardyck and Petrinovich, 1977; Fennell, Satz, Van den Abell, Bowers, and Thomas, 1978). Satz, Orsini, Saslow, and Henry (1985) propose that a relationship between manifest left-handedness defi- cits in visuospatial reason exist only for pathological left-handers. There is no evidence whatever, nor can we anticipate any, which links bilateral speech representation in neurologically-intact and "normal" persons to any such costs in visuospatial reasoning abilities. Nor is there any evidence that monol- inguals outperform polyglots on visuoconstructive or spatial tasks. Laponce focuses on the Sapir/Whorf thesis in order to make the point that languages are "cultur- ally specific" and not "fully translatable." This state- ment is true, but Whorf s point was that Standard Average European languages such as French and</page><page sequence="19">21 English stand in sharp contrast with Amerindian languages such as Hopi and Navajo. When we learn a new language, we gain not an opportunity to translate but rather an instrument of thought which provides an ability to participate in a different cul- ture, and to experience a new world view on its own level. In doing so we gain cognitive complexity, a sense of cultural relativity?which yields a reduction in ethnocentrism, and, as Laponce notes, an en- hanced capability for divergent thinking. In addition we gain a transcendence of our territorial and geo- graphical limits (Laponce's first level of spatiality). This indeed requires time and energy, but has as its reward a deepening of our participation in the world and a development of cognitive (and neurophysio- logical) complexity. Also, on the side of encouraging second-language learning, especially for children, is the enhancement of their capabilities to learn a third or higher-order language as adults. Children who have not had this experience are placed at a disad- vantage in learning a language they might need or desire to speak as adults. In this sense, remaining monolingual throughout childhood potentially re- stricts one's life chances for accomplishment in, and exploration of, the world. The issue of cultural separation in a multilingual society, while not the focus of my commentary, is obviously of concern to Laponce. On this level, there are possible sociopolitical costs of bilingualism per- taining to the survival and integrity of cultural groups. It is my position that, insofar as language learning has no well-established neurophysiological dysfunctions, such costs must be evaluated and acted upon on their own levels. Neurophysiology and neuropsychology are not apt to explain the so- called "territoriality" of languages. LANGUAGE AND NEUROPOLITICS Elliott White Department of Political Science Temple University Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19122 During the APSA meeting in Washington, D.C. over the 1984 Labor Day weekend, I had the privilege of hearing an earlier version of this provocative and pioneering paper. I was presenting my own paper on "space-time horizons" and neuropolitics and I natu- rally thought of both connections and questions that our two papers suggested. Ironically, the oral format of a panel that in theory should foster dialogue is in practice severely inhib- ited in this aim by the pressure of time constraints; whereas this format of "written dialogue" that Poli- tics and the Life Sciences has innovated now pro- vides me with a welcome opportunity for comment. In the remarks to follow, I will speculate on the linkage of linguistic and "multilinguistic" ability to politics. By linguistic ability I refer to an individual's ability to learn and to master his native language, that is, to speak and to write it well in accord with its dominant standards. By multilinguistic ability, I refer to an individual's ability to learn and to master more than one language. I will assume in these remarks that, following Bruner (1984:163; emphasis in the original), "If language was the human means by which we finally represented and interpreted the world, then its acquisition must shed light not only on language but on thought." Linguistic Ability and Politics In my own approach (White, 1984), I assume the existence of a profound genetic variability in human populations. This assumption is based on the popu- lational perspective of Mayr (1963:650) in which "no two individuals are alike." On a neurophysiological level this assumption translates into what R. W. Sperry (1982:1225) alludes to as a "growing recogni- tion of, and respect for the inherent individuality in the structure of human intellect"[:] "The more we learn, the more we recognize the unique complexity of any one individual intellect and the stronger the conclusion becomes that the individuality inherent in our brain networks makes that of fingerprints or facial features gross and simple by comparison"</page><page sequence="20">22 (cf. Harth, 1982:46, 232; Eccles and Robinson, 1984:43-44). This populational perspective necessarily qualifies Laponce's typological premise that a "biological explanation is more likely than the social" to yield constants. Although a biological explanation is surely involved in the universality of human lan- guage, it is by no means to be a priori excluded in accounting for the myriad variations that human language take. So my first conjecture would be: Are there not likely to be significant individual differences in lin- guistic ability? Are not these differences likely to be at least in part based upon genetic and hence neurophysiological factors? And, finally, are there not likely to be important political consequences flowing from such individual differences? Inasmuch as I have dealt with these questions previously (White, 1971) and inasmuch as they do not reflect the immediate concerns of Laponce, at least in this paper, I will not dwell upon them. But because these questions are so basic, I will briefly summarize my own earlier tentative and limited answers. Based upon a study of the candidates running for election in the 1965 Philadelphia antipov- erty election, I found (1) a wide variation among the candidates in verbal fluency; (2) that the more articulate candidates were significantly more likely to feel politically efficacious; (3) to be politically knowledgeable; and (4) to gain election. Since all the candidates shared a relatively similar lower class social background (as the election ground rules in effect dictated), I assumed that genetic as well as environmental factors were re- sponsible for the variation in verbal fluency that was found and for its apparent political consequences. One final note of more direct relevance to the Laponce paper: the measure of political knowledge- ability involved naming six public officials, including, e.g., the secretary of welfare for the state of Pennsyl- vania and the speaker of the United States House of Representatives; and as I had observed (White, 1971:908), "The fact?that the officials named were 'mainstream' and not community political leaders implies that the articulate candidates were relatively more attuned to mainstream political life." Or, as I will shortly suggest, both linguistic and multilinguis- tic ability may relate to differing territorial identifica- tions. Multilinguistic Ability and Politics Both Laponce and I assume, as he writes, that "it is likely that genetic differences explain why some people acquire second languages more easily than others." But unlike Laponce, for whom such individ- ual variation is not "interesting" and therefore does "not concern us here," I find it of vital political importance. Let me expand. I first of all assume a wide individual variation in multilinguistic ability. At one pole are those who have severe difficulty in learning even one language, let alone a second one; at the other extreme are those "exceptions," in Laponce's words, who ac- quire foreign languages "for the sole pleasure of reaching and penetrating a foreign culture." In con- trast to Laponce's apparent dichotomous position here, I assume more or less a continuum in individ- ual variation between these two poles. Secondly, I would assume a rough correspon- dence between both linguistic and multilinguistic ability, on the one hand, and what 1 have termed "space-time horizons" (White, 1984), on the other. In other words, the greater the ability of the individual to learn and to master one or more languages, the greater his ability to conceptualize over time and space. The latter capacity embraces the idea of territoriality (in the "home range" sense) and in- volves at least the prospect that the more multil- inguistically able individual will be relatively more cosmopolitan rather than local in his or her (political) outlook. Now let me proceed, based upon these theoreti- cal suppositions, to speculate on how various indi- viduals, as characterized by their linguistic and multilinguistic abilities, might act in a legally or nominally bi- or multilingual society. First of all, I would expect the least articulate monolinguals to be most resistant to both bilingual education and to the more politically cosmopolitan outlook that such bilin- gualism implies. Indeed, the least articulate monol- inguals should also be the most apolitical members of the society. Territorial segregation by language should espe- cially characterize the least articulate monolinguals. Where, as likely, such linguistic and territorial segre- gation has an underlying ethnic dimension, then the sociobiological or inclusive fitness understanding of kin and ethnically based religious, linguistic, and territorial identifications may very well apply. On the other hand, when what I have termed "qualitative" (as against the sociobiologically quan- titative) genetic factors are at work (White, forthcom- ing), such ethnic, linguistic, and territorial identifica- tions may loosen. That is to say, both the most fluent monolinguals and multilinguals are more likely to be upwardly mobile and relatively culturally and politi- cally cosmopolitan. Their mobility is, as a result, likely to have an explicitly spatial dimension, i.e., they are likely to move out of more parochial, entirely monolingual enclaves and form relatively more bilin- gual communities. The "elite level" to which Laponce refers represents the extreme in this devel- opment.</page><page sequence="21">23 Laponce does, however, indicate by his interest- ing discussion of the Dormic experiment that the most able and cosmopolitan bilinguals may yet experience the greatest frustration by virtue of the higher level linguistic demands placed upon them. Such frustration conceivably could produce separat- ist, less cosmopolitan tendencies. Enough speculation. I need only conclude that while I fully endorse the inclusion of a neuropolitical dimension in Laponce's paper, I would also have welcomed a more explicitly populational perspec- tive.</page><page sequence="22">24 AUTHOR'S RESPONSE My five commentators?whose names were among those I had suggested to the editor?fully satisfied my expectation that they would be challenging. Their comments and suggestions reflect their own specific research interests. They reflect also the characteristics of their disciplines, located as they are at varying distances from Political Science, distances that increase as one goes from Pool and White who are politologists, to Mackey, a sociol- inguist, to TenHouten, a socio-psychologist, and finally to Sussman who describes himself as a card- carrying neuropsychologist. 1 shall respond to their comments in the reverse order of those distances. I had hoped that Sussman's critiques would be informative. Disappointingly, they are not as useful as they could have been because of his biased reading of my paper (I am not defending a cause, nor preaching to governments) and because of his unwillingness to consult the evidence on which I base my argument. Two of the pitfalls of interdisciplinary research (unless it be done by an interdisciplinary team) are that one will occasionally quote the 'wrong' authors and give undue attention to new, not yet well established findings. I tried to guard against that last danger by separating the secure from the insecure, the concordant from the isolated; but, apparently, I made the mistake of quoting Shanon and Hatch (I did however quote Geschwind and Vaid and Genesee, among others). I have noted similar 'mistakes' by non-political scientists who extend their search to political science. These 'mis- takes'?quoting a popularizer rather than a well established author for example?signal immediately that the writer is an outsider. I plead guilty on that minor count, minor since Sussman does not object here to what I said so much as to whom I quoted.1 Interdisciplinary 'travel', while having these unfortu- nate drawbacks, has, however, compensating ad- vantages: putting a new light on works that have become too familiar and drawing attention to studies from other disciplines that had completely escaped one's attention. My search for neuropsychological factors contrib- uting to the territoriality of languages would have left me practically empty-handed, if it had not been for the concordant experiments of Kolers, Macnamara, Marsh and Maki. The experiments that show the lesser effectiveness of a) solving problems in a second language (at least on difficult tasks); b) being forced to shift language in mid-communica- tion, and; c) experiencing noncongruence between the language spoken and the language of the envi- ronment. Sussman is correct in noting that I rest 'my' case on those studies. If the latter are shown to me to be unreliable, I shall abandon an explanation to which I am no more committed than to any ordinary hypothesis. But confronted with studies unknown to him, Sussman reacts in a rather haughty way. Meaning to be ironic, he calls these findings 'gems' and 'discoveries' and since he has not read them, decides that they are not worth reading.2 Surely, the library of the University of Austin, Texas, is as well supplied as my own. If not, one should reserve judgment until one has become better in- formed. If Sussman, or others, show me that I should change my interpretation, I shall do so. In the meantime that interpretation still stands. Sussman refers to his article of 1982 to argue that I should not have said that there was practically no support for a hypothesis of lesser lateralization of the two languages of a bilingual. There is no dis- agreement here between us. The sentence he quotes, as the reading of the sentence that follows it should make perfectly clear, refers to the lesser lateralization of both languages. To describe Suss- man's findings on the lesser lateralization of one of the languages, I say: "the second (hypothesis)</page><page sequence="23">25 states that the bilingual is less lateralized in the non- native language. That interpretation is partially sup- ported by the literature." "Partially" describes well the situation summarized by both Soares and Suss- man. Sussman's hasty and too systematically negative criticisms are unfortunately not atypical and make the interdisciplinary dialogue to which this journal is committed so very difficult. TenHouten stresses that a limited cortex capacity model is not particularly useful to the study of bilingualism; a language does not take the space of another language. But, even if there are always unused cells in the brain (see Mackey), the lan- guages, whenever and in whatever way they are stored, interfere with one another. The French/ English bilingual no longer knows, for example, that the word 'coercion' exists in only one of the two languages, and no longer finds amusing a bilingual child saying "Il y a quelque chose de mal avec le lait." The English "There is something wrong with the milk" stands in the way of, blurs as it were, the image of milk "in the company" of something bad. Do these interferences have neurophysiological as well as social explanations? The tag-theory sug- gests that possibility. Interference, if not caused by lack of space, might be due to scanning difficulties. Never mind the interferences, says TenHouten, they are a very small cost to pay for the benefits of bilingualism. That is also what I say, most of the time, but that is not the point. My object was not to balance social benefits against psychological costs; it was, on the contrary, to identify factors that might explain the preference for unilingual settings when one controls for the social costs and benefits. TenHouten refuses to explain territoriality by the present state of research on the multilingual brain, while, guardedly, I say that the studies on the differential lateralization of different languages, while yet inconclusive, keep the question open. In so doing TenHouten gives less potential importance to his own findings than I do. If the Hopi language involves the use of the right hemisphere to a greater extent than English and if that phenomenon is linked to a specific way of perceiving one's environment, one embodied in the language itself, would this not explain why the Hopi people, to a greater extent than other language groups, French or Spanish for example, would need to remain close to one another territorially? If English were to become the L1 of too many of them, would not the Hopi culture be threatened not only linguistically but, more funda- mentally, in its very specific way of relating to the environment? It would be particularly interesting to compare the brain waves of Hopi/English bilinguals of varied levels of fluency, from Hopi L, to Hopi L2. TenHouten makes a fascinating suggestion when he speculates that if bilingualism, involves the greater use of the right hemisphere of the brain?at least at certain stages of the learning process?it might, for that very reason, be the cause of a visuo- spatial deficit. If such a hypothesis were verified, he would then have to modify his conclusion that "language learning has no well-established neurophysiological dysfunction." Like TenHouten, Mackey notes that I tend to reify languages, that I speak of them as one would of animal species. Indeed I do, but I do so for conve- nience, not for any desire to join the school of language Romantics. It is useful sometimes to think of people as having governments, religions, families, or languages. At other times, it is analytically prefer- able to reverse the relation and to think of states, religions, and languages as having people. That reversal is particularly useful when one studies the evolution of social systems in contact over long periods of time. If Mackey and I disagree on the dangers resulting from the reification of languages, we agree on the role of the State, one of the most reified among social institutions. Governments have increasingly assumed the role of language planners and of leaders of ethno-linguistic groups from whom they seek support and loyalty. Thus we see, in Canada, the French and the English replaced by Francophones and Anglophones. Mackey wonders whether Sapir and Whorf, had they been French, would have formulated their controversial hypothesis as they did. French would probably have helped them. They could have said that a 'langue' implies a certain 'language'. I need not set myself here as a defender of that hypothesis since I do not subscribe to its extreme formulation, but I wonder whether Mackey is not overly critical when he compares it to a double-barrel gun that fires blanks on one side and does not fire on the other. Is it firing blanks to say?as Mackey says himself and I agree with him?that each language is bound by its context, by its own net of associations and images? In its extremely deterministic form the Whorf/Sapir hypothesis does not work and does not help, but reduced to a probabilistic statement it becomes useful: the probability that an element of a given language, hence the thoughts, ideas, and images associated with it, will interact with other elements of the same language, hence other thoughts, ideas, and images, in ways that would not obtain in a different language. If we are not the prisoners of the languages we use, we are not free from their specific influences and biases either. Pushing doors that are not locked, crossing thresh- olds that lead to the outside can be done, but it requires an effort.</page><page sequence="24">26 Man is a bundle of different roles, says Mackey, and all the more so in the modern city where one interacts with many different people, many different cultures and subcultures. Hence, being diglossie or multilingual is simply one more illustration of our remarkable ability to be different selves to different people. I agree but I note that diglossie or bilingual situations are typically the result of the mixing of populations that were not previously in contact (or at least not to the same extent). In a closed system where communication is dense, the trend is not towards multilingualism, it is in the opposite direc- tion. Jonathan Pool asks a series of challenging ques- tions that invite me to depart, even more so than in answering Mackey, from my original intention not to consider social costs and benefits. I shall do so by adding a few illustrations to his perceptive com- ments. The institutional cost of obtaining or maintaining the uniformity of a language likely to diverge into segments because of the low density of communica- tion among its speakers is illustrated by the policies of states such as France and Quebec, policies alluded to by Mackey. The French Academy, cre- ated in the 17th century, the Office and the Conseil de la langue fran?aise created in Quebec a few years ago, the French practice of assigning school teachers irrespective of their region of origin, have the conscious purpose, at varying social and individ- ual costs, of homogenizing a nation linguistically. The comparison among artificial, computer, and natural languages is rich in rewards. Pool has done some fascinating work on the subject. However, one study (as far as I know) still remains to be done: the study of interferences among the various computer languages used by programmers working either under normal conditions or under stress. If interfer- ences have neurophysiological underpinnings, we should note them among artificial as well as natural languages. It would be particularly interesting to test whether such interferences are due to uneven use and memory accessibility, as suggested by Mackey, or whether, under stress, there is a tendency to resort to the symbolic system first learned. Each computer program has its own function, and is best adapted to some specific purpose; BASIC is not ALGOL. The same is true of the two languages used in situations of diglossia. There is a major difference however. For an Egyptian Moslem, En- glish is unacceptable for prayer, and Arabic inade- quate for physics or chemistry. The inability of those two natural languages to perform equally well in all domains is not due, however, to an inherent weak- ness of the languages qua language; it is due rather to social and cultural causes, to the fact that some languages have not been allowed to evolve, to adapt to certain usages. In such cases, I agree with Pool, effectiveness requires that one should shift from one language to another, or say from Arabic to English or French, as one moves from say politics to science. But, if the experimental evidence I men- tioned is to be trusted, that shift has a cost. We say, sometimes, that English is what Latin used to be. Not quite. The French, the Germans, and the Polish scientists who debated in Latin in the 16th and 17th century were not competing with colleagues for whom Latin was an L, across all their roles. The French, the Germans, and the Poles who now com- pete with their English colleagues, compete with an L2 against an Ln. I do, of course, agree with Pool that knowing a language is not a case of either-or. Measuring knowledge requires that one know the needs, the language needs, of the individual or of the group to be assessed. But, what matters to me is that people, especially when their language needs are high and when communication is dense, tend to group them- selves geographically according to their L?^. If they do not do so, or if their territorial niche is penetrated by the language of a more powerful ethnic group? as in the case of German fragmenting Romanche in Switzerland, or English penetrating French in Mani- toba?then the language, assuming it is a minority language, has lesser chances of survival (Weinrech, 1968; Castonguay, 1979; Laponce, 1984a, 1984b). White asks whether the differences in the ability of individuals to learn more than one language?differ- ences that may well have a genetic base?have political consequences. Very likely they have. In Canada, some bilingual schools screen their appli- cants by means of tests that restrict attendance to those gifted for languages. This academic selection may well contribute?to a very small extent?to the genetic selection of an administrative and political elite. However, and that is why I had not considered this problem, we have no evidence that the genetic ability to learn more than one language varies across cultures and nations. If Americans and English Canadians appear less gifted than Danes or Norwe- gians, perhaps the explanation is, to a certain extent, in the quality of their schools, but, more fundamentally, it lies in differences in their location in the power hierarchy among nations. Should the United States be reduced to the military rank of Denmark and should English no longer be spoken elsewhere, Americans would rapidly become ex- tremely gifted at learning foreign tongues. As for the population perspective that White would have liked me to consider, I shall beg for time ?not only because of the magnitude of the task, but also because, as I write these comments, I am away from my University library and pressed by the edi- tor's deadline. Let me simply indicate here that</page><page sequence="25">27 recent surveys done in Quebec indicate that, among Francophones, those most in favor of bilingualism are not the bilinguals. This makes sense if we consider a distinction suggested by Fishman (1967), the distinction between bilingualism-with-bicultural- ism and bilingualism-without-biculturalism. Those most likely to feel the strain of bilingualism are those who are involved in two cultures, rather than those for whom the L2 is simply a foreign language with no effect on one's daily life or ethnic identity. Those having negative reactions against bilingualism are thus more likely to be found in the group of bil- inguals-biculturals who experience frequent dissoci- ation between L, and Ci. Finally, I should like to return to a factor I had mentioned without giving it the attention it deserves (as Sussman rightly points out): the age factor. It is generally observed (Lenneberg, 1967; Larew, 1961; Masson, 1964; Asher and Garcia, 1969) that past the age of puberty, it is extremely improbable that one will ever bring a newly learned language, especially in the speech, to the level of a language acquired at a younger age. Adults may well transform a newly acquired L2 into an L,, but they will continue, to a greater or lesser extent, to speak and sound 'for- eign'. That is obviously not from a desire to do so, except in rare cases where the foreigness is culti- vated to advantage, as one would with use of a mask or an exotic dress. The cost of foreign lan- guage acquisition is much higher for adults than for children-and that for biological as well as cultural reasons-yet the decisions to move from one lan- guage group to another are typically made by adults. Obviously, to measure the outcome of the forces that push in the opposite directions of either multilingualism or unilingualism, one must consider, case by case, the whole array of biological, cultural, and social factors that affect the individuals and the groups concerned. That was not my purpose, but that is a fascinating subject that lends itself very well to the use of cost and benefit models adapted from economics (Vaillancourt, 1983). ?Jean A. Laponce Notes 1. For Sussman's misreading of my use of Shanon, see below the paragraph ending with footnote 3. The model I used to summarize the literature is that proposed by Vaid and Genesee. 2. Macnamara is hardly an unknown. I am not the only one to quote him, Mackey quotes him too in this very Issue. Macnamara is listed ten times in Sabourin and Petifs analytical bibliography of 1978. 3. The Sussman et al. study of 1982 used a group of male right-handed bilinguals fluent in different lan- guages, one of which was always English. The study concludes to a greater level of right-hemisphere involvement for L2, especially when it has been acquired late. Soares (1984), in a study more recent than that mentioned by Sussman (Soares, 1982) finds, again, among right-handed Portugese-English male bilinguals who acquired Enlish after puberty, that there is no difference in left-hemisphere lateral- ization of the two languages nor any significant difference between the bilinguals and the monol- ingual control group. Both Sussman and Soares use a finger tapping test. References Albert, M., and L. Obler (1978). The Bilingual Brain: Neurophysiological and Neurolinguistic Aspects of Bilingualism.
