Smith Published online: 28 September 2006 ? Springer Science-hBusiness Media, LLC 2006 Abstract This paper examines the intellectual traditions and recent advances in the archae ology of the Bronze and Iron Ages of the South Caucasus. The first goal of the paper is to provide an account of the scholarly traditions that have oriented research in the region since the mid-nineteenth century. This discussion provides a detailed case study of an archaeolog ical tradition that arose within the context of Russian and Soviet research?traditions still poorly understood within Western archaeology. Yet archaeology in the South Caucasus was strongly influenced by international research in neighboring southwest Asia, and thus the region's intellectual currents often diverged from the debates and priorities that predomi nated in Moscow. The second goal of this paper is to outline the primary issues that orient contemporary work in the region from the Neolithic through the Urartian period. My interest here is both didactic and prognostic. While I am concerned to fairly represent the primary foci of contemporary regional scholarship, I also make an argument for a deeper investigation of the constitution of social life. Such studies are critical to the advancement of archaeology in the South Caucasus over the coming decade. Keywords Bronze Age Iron Age Urartu Caucasus History of archaeology Introduction During the second decade of the eighth century B.C., the army of Argishti I, king of Biainili, forded the Araks river on a campaign that ultimately drew portions of southern Caucasia into a flourishing empire which the neighboring Assyrians knew as Urartu. In an historical sense, Argishti's defeat of towns and countries on the Shirak and Ararat Plains marks a watershed in the political and social history of southern Caucasia. With the construction of large fortress complexes at Erebuni and Argishtihinili, much of the region was assimilated into an empire that unified the Armenian Highland from the Upper Euphrates in the west to A.

Moreover, Argishti's arrival in southern Caucasia brought with it a royal program of textual production (utilizing a cuneiform script borrowed from neighboring Assyria) which drew the region's places and populations into a quasi-historical narrative of kings and conquests. As a result of this program of textual representation, Urartu has traditionally been seen as just one among a number of kingdoms that arose during the first millennium B.C. in the peripheries of the "greater ancient Near East," a secondary state inspired by political institutions and cultural traditions forged in Mesopotamia. However, in an archaeological sense, Argishti's campaigns can be read less as the arrival of unfamiliar "Near Eastern" ways on the doorstep of Eurasia than a strong affirmation of locally developed social traditions and political institutions. In this view, Urartu emerged from a local political tradition centered in dispersed fortresses rather than aggregated urban landscapes. This tradition expanded out of southern Caucasia during the late second millennium B.C. to re-shape the broad regional ecumene of the Armenian Highland. In this sense, Argishti is less the conqueror of the Caucasus than, to appropriate Pushkin, yet another one of its captives. Archaeological theory and practice in southern Caucasia has long grappled with the complexities of understanding the shifting relations between local traditions and global transformations as problems of both artifact periodization and (pre)historical interpretation. This article examines the promethean character of prehistory in the region both as it has been imagined by those outside it and practiced by those within. A region long defined by its historical, continental, geopolitical, social, cultural, linguistic, and even moral liminality, the archaeology of southern Caucasia is likewise promethean in both its objects?communities that steadfastly resist reduction to archetypical models?and its subjects?a tradition of scholarship that was neither steeped in Western colonialism nor exhausted by Russian im perialism. This article provides an account of the theoretical priorities, historical problems, and practical dispositions that have oriented archaeology in southern Caucasia since the mid-nineteenth century. Imagining Southern Caucasia The South Caucasus (or Caucasia) occupies a distinctive place within both the ancient and modern geographic imaginations. The Greek tragedy Prometheus Bound, traditionally attributed to Aeschylus and dated to the mid-fifth century B.C. (cf. Griffith, 1977), sets the story of human salvation (and the punishment of the savior) on the bare, wind-swept slopes of the Caucasus: "the remotest region of the earth... a wilderness without a footprint" (Aeschylus, 1961, In. 1-2). The drama opens as Prometheus is shackled to the mountain slope. Having bestowed the secret of fire from Olympus upon mortals, thus saving humankind from Zeus's murderous wrath, the fate of humanity is bound up in the eternal suffering of the savior. Yet the Prometheus story was not the only early myth to set the Caucasus and the Armenian Highland within an epochal moral landscape of transgression and redemption. Most famously, the mountains of "Ararat" (a corruption of the Assyrian "Urartu" [Piotrovskii, 1969, p. 13]) provided Biblical authors with a region sufficiently distant, mountainous, and poorly known to serve as the legendary refuge of Noah's ark (Genesis, 8.4). Looking west from the Caucasus, what is most compelling about these tales is that both the Noah and Prometheus stories anchor the region to enduring narratives of disobedience, punishment, and redemption. The mythic moral precariousness of Caucasia has long provided profound depth to the region's perceived geographic marginality, betwixt and between the continental and ^ Springer</page><page sequence="3">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 231 socio-cultural worlds of Europe and Asia. In the early Greek tradition, Caucasia's posi tion was highly unstable as the boundary between Europe and Asia shifted between the Tanais (Don), the Phasis (Rioni), and the Araks rivers?a situation which Herodotus found extremely vexing: Nor can I conjecture for what reason three different names [Libya, Europe, Asia] have been given to the earth, which is but one... nor why the Egyptian river Nile and the Colchian Phasis have been assigned as boundaries to it (some say the Maeotian river Tanais and the Cimmerian Porthmeia); nor can I learn the names of those who made this division, nor from whence they derived the appellations (Herodotus, 1992, Book IV.45). In the late first century B.C., the geographer Strabo (1854, Book XI.I.l) formally de fined the Tanais River as the frontier between Europe and Asia, establishing a geographic convention that led cartographers from Claudius Ptolemy (A.D. 90-168) to Hermann Moll (18th century) to classify the Caucasian isthmus as part of Asia. But the mutually reinforc ing tropes of continental and moral precariousness have proven singularly enduring as the region's dominant representational cliche. The difficulty archaeologists and historians face in re-imagining the ancient world of the Caucasus is reading against the grain of a widespread journalistic tendency to render contemporary socio-political orders as inherent in place rather than generated within complex histories of place (e.g., Kaplan, 2000; Karny, 2000). Unfortunately, at present the Caucasus is only faintly inscribed in the archaeological traditions of Europe and the U.S. The tensions of the Cold War certainly contributed to the marginalization of the region within the archaeology of the ancient Near East as it developed in the years after World War II. For example, despite the titular centrality of the region to the emergence and spread of the Early Bronze Age Kura-Araxes archaeological horizon (a.k.a. Early Transcaucasian Culture [Burney &amp; Lang, 1972]), the most spatially extensive material culture horizon in Bronze Age southwest Asia, the southern Caucasus is entirely absent from almost all major Western synthetic discussions of the ancient Near East (e.g., Kuhrt, 1995; Maisels, 1993; Nissen, 1988; pace Sasson et ai, 1995). Similarly, Western overviews of European prehistory rarely embrace the Caucasus [e.g., Kristiansen, 1998; pace Bogucki and Crabtree, 2004]. When the region is mentioned in Western prehistories of Europe or the Near East, it is typically as a source of raw materials and resources (such as obsidian), a periphery to the real work of social and economic development occurring to the south or west (cf. Kohl, 1993). Resistance to the traditional depiction of the Caucasus as the precarious margin of Europe and Asia, of Orient and Occident, of the civilizations of the ancient Near East, the Russian Steppe, and the Mediterranean world, is not to argue that the region was not profoundly shaped by neighboring communities. However, over-emphasizing the region's neighbors has had a pernicious effect, forestalling much needed attention to local practices and histories. The South Caucasus was undeniably part of the worlds of both the ancient Near East and Eurasia. But its (pre)history is not reducible to the margins. Indeed, perhaps the most striking dimension of the region's prehistory is the impermeability of its social boundaries, stringently regulating the passage of materials into and out of the Armenian Highlands and South Caucasus even as these communities grew increasingly bound to each other. But how can we re-imagine the South Caucasus then, in its own terms? What were the local traditions that were nurtured here? How did communities grow and transform? And how can we conceptualize their lasting impact on continental prehistory and contemporary anthropological archaeology? ^ Springer</page><page sequence="4">232 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 42*GTTE 44*0tTE 46*OtF? 4?*0tFE SCOtFE _t_?_t_I ,, .t .). ?i-?t?-1-1-1-~r~ OWE 42*0tTE 44*OtTE 46*OtTE 50*OtTE Fig. 1 Physical and political map of the Caucasus with the major geographic provinces A geographic introduction to the region The Great Caucasus range traverses over 1100 km along the northern end of the isthmus that divides the southern Eurasian steppes from the highlands of northern southwest Asia (Fig. 1). The South Caucasus, or Caucasia (formerly Transcaucasia), today includes the three independent republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, along with disputed regions in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Nagorno-Karabakh. Although today defined by modem political boundaries established by the Treaty of Lausanne (1923)?borders etched more deeply by the Cold War?the South Caucasus in topographic terms flows uninterrupted into the Armenian Highland, the highest of the uplands (along with the Anatolian plateau to the west and the Iranian plateau to the east) that make up the northern sectors of southwest Asia (or the Near East). Because there is no clearly defined geographic boundary between southern Caucasia and the Armenian Highland (Kohl, 1992, p. 224), the precise referent of each term can often prove elusive. I follow the post-Soviet geographic tradition and use the term South Caucasus to refer only to the territory between the Araks and Great Caucasus ridge encompassed predominantly by the modern republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. The Armenian Highland describes a much broader orographic province extending west to the Antitaurus mountains, that includes the highland portion of the southern Caucasus to the Kura river drainage but excludes the low-lying Colchian and Mughan steppes. It is important to note that the significant geographic points of reference for archaeology in the South Caucasus tend to shift from era to era. As a result, the discussions in this article also shift their focus at ^ Springer</page><page sequence="5">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 233 times, ranging from southern Caucasia, to the South Caucasus, to the Armenian Highlands as the data warrant. The geographic provinces of the South Caucasus are most readily defined in reference to elevation and to the Kura and Araks river drainages. The highlands of northern Caucasia are defined by the Middle Kura river and its associated drainages, including the Pambak/Debed system and the Agstef (Akstafa) river. The province is characterized climatically by hot dry summers and mild dry winters while the vegetation consists primarily of temperate grasslands. Western Caucasia consists of the Colchian plain, drained by the westward flowing Rioni and Inguri rivers. The climate tends toward mild summers and damp winters supporting mixed deciduous and coniferous forests. Annual rainfall averages approximately 2,500 mm, making it the wettest province of the South Caucasus. Eastern Caucasia (the steppes of Azerbaijan, crossed by the lower Araks and Kura) is a similarly low-lying area characterized by broad open steppe terrain with riverine vegetation. Summers tend to be mild and winters humid, though little rain falls throughout the year (in general, less than 200 mm) in this, the driest of Caucasia's provinces (Cole &amp; German, 1961; Dewdney, 1979; Plashchev &amp; Chekmarev, 1978). Southern Caucasia includes the highland Middle Araks river and its drainages. Average elevation is between 1,200 and 1,800 m above sea level, dipping below 1,000 m only in the Ararat plain. Summers are hot, dry and short while winters tend to be long and harsh, with moderate accumulations of snow (Hewsen, 1997, 2001). The vegetation tends to steppe/prairie but varies significantly with elevation from the salt marshes of the Ararat plain to the deciduous forests of Syunik, to the alpine regimes of the upper mountain slopes. Cultivation is difficult in the region without irrigation as rainfall is generally light (between 150-300 mm annual precipitation in the Ararat plain) and concentrated in the spring (Tardzhumanian, 1984). Irrigation historically has concentrated as much on the capture and storing of snow-melt as the exploitation of river systems, since the latter tend to rest at the bottoms of deep gorges. In this discussion, I focus primarily upon southern Caucasia?territorially, an area that roughly corresponds to the borders of modern Armenia?although some consideration of archaeology in Georgia is also required. Not only did Georgian archaeology provide con siderable intellectual leadership in the region during the Soviet period, but sites from north ern Caucasia also provide key reference collections for the South Caucasus as a whole. Azerbaijan is unfortunately not as well-represented in the following discussion since eastern Caucasia has received less archaeological attention overall and has been more closely in conversation with research in the adjacent lowlands of eastern Daghestan and northwestern Iran than highland Caucasia. While southern and northeastern Armenia still boast large forests, the majority of the country is rather barren, a vista made even more stark by the boulders and bedrock outcrops that characterize the region's mountain slopes. Looking more closely, however, the initial impression of a rocky moonscape is slowly controverted as detailed inspection reveals one cluster of boulders to mark a cemetery, another, a fortress, yet another, the ruins of a village. This landscape has inspired a long and complex history of archaeological investigation. In a recent article, Ian Lindsay and I (in press) have attempted to provide a history of archaeology in Armenia that describes the most significant research programs and their role in changing the dominant approaches to regional research practice. Here I focus my account more on an intellectual history of regional archaeology, with a particular concern to describe southern Caucasia in reference to both theoretical shifts elsewhere (Russia, Europe, and America) and the socio-political context of investigation. Although there are points of overlap between the two narratives (and earlier histories of archaeology in the region such ^ Springer</page><page sequence="6">234 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 as that by Areshian [1987]), much still remains to be written in moving us towards a more definitive account of the region's complex disciplinary genealogy. A brief history of archaeological research In the fifth century A.D., the historian Moses Khorenats'i lent his narrative of Armenian national formation a sense of place by weaving myth and history into the major ruins that dot the landscape of the Armenian Highland (see Thomson [1978] for a discussion of the considerable controversy that surrounds the dating of Khorenats'i's text). In relating the death of the mythic Armenian ruler Ara the Beautiful, Khorenats'i describes the conquest of the plain of Van by Queen Semiramis of Assyria, who erected a stone-walled fortress at Van Kale to rule the land, a great canal to irrigate it, and inscribed stone markers to delineate its boundaries. Passing through many places, [Semiramis] arrived from the east at the edge of the salt lake [Lake Van]_[She] ordered forty-two thousand workers from Assyria and other lands of the empire... to be brought without delay to the desired spot_First she ordered the aqueduct for the river to be built in hard and massive stone, cemented with mortar and sand, of infinite length and height;... within a few years she completed the marvelous [city] with strong walls and bronze gates_And not only this, but also in many places in the land of Armenia she set up stelae and ordered memorials to herself to be written on them_And in many places she fixed the boundaries [of the kingdom] with the same writing (Khorenats'i, 1978, Book 1.16). Epigraphic research in the nineteenth century demonstrated that the ruins of Van Kale and numerous other fortresses were built by the kings of Urartu, not by Semiramis. Yet Khore nats'i's effort to understand the monuments that surrounded him in relation to a sweeping historical narrative marks an early speculative era in the formation of an archaeological description of the Armenian Highland. Such scholastic meditations on the ruins of the region thrived throughout the medieval and early modern eras, with Khorenats'i's text setting the basic narrative agenda (later augmented by additional textual materials from Greek and Roman sources). Anania of Shirak's seventh century Ashkharhats' oyts (Geography) provided a detailed account of the region strongly influenced by both Khorenats'i's history and geographical accounts provided by Strabo, Pliny, and Ptolemy (Shirakts'i, 1994). Arabic and Persian texts from the ninth and tenth centuries A.D. also included descriptions of the Armenian Highland within broader surveys of the Islamic world. But none of the medieval authors significantly altered the basic terms of the scholastic understanding of major ruins defined by Khorenats'i. A significant intellectual transformation in the interpretation of ancient monuments fol lowed from the arrival of European travelers and Russian forces in the Caucasus during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Writing from a substantive aesthetic viewpoint similar to the historicism advanced by Herder (1966), European travelers interpreted sites such as the Medieval city of Ani as direct expressions of Armenian national character. Ruins, monuments, and landscapes thus provided resonant media for broad cultural evaluations. Compare the following accounts of the area around Echmiadzin, both published in the early eighteenth century by European travelers. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="7">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 235 Everything there is ruined, deserted, or uncivilized. Every one there breathes only of tyranny and slavery in the civil state, and self-interest, superstition and ignorance in religion (Lucas, 1714, p. 246). Our learned men may judge as they please; but as I have never seen a more beautiful Country than the neighborhood of Three-Churches [Echmiadzin], I am strongly per suaded that Adam and Eve were created there (de Tournefort and Bartlett, 1718, Vol. II, p. 325). Not until the nineteenth century were the idiosyncratic observations of travelers and scholastics succeeded by more systematic efforts to understand the material remains strewn across the Armenian Highland. However, the substantive historicism of eighteenth century scholars remained the dominant conceptual apparatus in Russian archaeology well into the Soviet period, bundling artifact, place, and nationality into a unique theory of ethnic formation. Archaeology and empire: 1704-1892 Early Russian archaeology flourished under the sponsorship of Peter the Great, who founded the Kunstkamera in St. Petersburg in 1704 as a home for a burgeoning collection of antiquities brought to the Tsar's court as mementos of the expanding imperium. The Tsar formalized Russian collecting in 1718 when he decreed that district governors and military commanders should collect and remit artifacts and curiosities to St. Petersburg. The eighteenth century witnessed several major excavations of large kurgans (the Russian term for a barrow or tomb formed by an earthen and/or stone tumulus heaped atop one or more burial chambers) across the Russian steppe, from the bronze-filled kurgans near Krasnoiarsk (1739) in Siberia to the "royal" Scythian tomb at Mel'gunovsky (1763) near the headwaters of the Ingulets River (Black, 1986; Miller, 1956). After 1774, when Russia gained access to the Black Sea coast, military topographers from the General Staff began to plot the locations of ruins, ascribing tentative names culled from Classical sources. And in 1786, G. A. Potemkin ordered the governor of Tauric province (Crimea) to organize searches for ancient coins (Tunkina, 2003, p. 305). Yet although archaeological explorations of classical sites in Crimea generated an immense wealth of artifacts and stimulated the founding of an archaeological museum in Kerch (1826), it produced an archaeological imagination most aroused by the distant legacy of Greece rather than an understanding of regional history. Russian philhellenism, strongly influenced by the German philological humanism of Winckelmann (Marchand, 1996), left an indelible mark on the Black Sea coast visible in the hellenized Turkish and Tatar toponyms of the area (e.g. Cherson, Olbiopol, Sevastopol, Simferopol, Phanagoria, Odessa, etc.). However, while the Grecophilia of German intel lectuals centered upon a recuperation of distinctly German culture and institutions against the hegemony of Augustan neoclassicism, early Russian archaeology on the Black Sea was patronized by a western oriented aristocracy whose "class interests overtly continued to outweigh a sense of ethnic identity" (Trigger, 1989, p. 209). "The Greeks" were cast as a foreign civilizing agent struggling to gain mastery over the local barbarians?a description that fit the eighteenth century Russian aristocracy's alienation from Russian society at large better than it did the ancient Greek colonists (few nobles spoke Russian since French was the primary language of the court [Hosking, 2001]). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="8">236 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 Following Napoleon's ruinous campaign against Russia in 1812, the aristocracy?many of whom served as officers in the military?began to turn its back on Europe, forsaking Peter I's legacy. The devastation brought by the French armies to the Russian countryside engendered a suspicion of traditional Petrine francophilia and a surge of interest in the Russian language, folk songs, stories, dances, and dress. As Orlando Figes (2002, p. 72) argues, the battlefield sacrifices of the peasant soldiers generated a new class of liberal noblemen: officers and aristocrats "who lost their pride in class but found their countrymen in the ranks of 1812." It is not surprising then that the Imperial Archaeology Commission was established in 1851 to systematize a burgeoning field of excavations whose primary objects were not the remains of classical cities occupied by foreign colonists, but rather an increasingly varied array of antiquities that stretched from Paleolithic and Neolithic sites such as Kostenki and Tripolye (respectively) to the medieval remains of early Slavs. One legacy of the broad cultural transformations engendered by the crises of 1812 was thus the emergence of an archaeology of Russia and its antecedents rather than the collection of antiquities in Russia, which had dominated the previous century of work. Into the Caucasus Russian archaeology in the Caucasus during the nineteenth century developed in tandem with political, economic, and military expansion (like its European counterparts in Britain, France, and Germany) and was practiced, initially, by aristocratic elites and the bureaucratic foot soldiers of empire (compare, for example, pioneering Near Eastern archaeologists like Major Henry Rawlinson, an agent in the British Colonial Administration, and Paolo E. Botta, a doctor in the French military). Russia established its first beachhead in the South Caucasus thanks to what has come to be a critical triangulation for the small polities of the region. During the 1770s and 1780s, the borders of Ottoman and Persian territories in the South Caucasus were a matter of dispute. Seeking a means to secure independence, Irakli II, king of Georgia, signed the treaty of Georgievsk in 1783, recognizing the sovereignty of the Russian Tsars in return for their commitment to secure the territorial integrity of Georgia against Persian and Ottoman claims (Cornell, 2001, p. 34). However throughout the 1780s, Russia was a rather distant presence in the South Caucasus, lacking a secure route through the Great Caucasus. Russian armies effectively breached the Great Caucasus in 1791 when Sheikh Mansur, a Chechen Naqshbandi leader, was captured, ending the resistance of the Sufi brotherhoods and opening a road to Georgia and places farther south (Gune-Yadcy, 2003). The Russian Empire moved rather quickly in the South Caucasus, pushing south into Armenia and the Azerbaijani khanates as far as the Araks river. The Treaty of Turkmenchai (1828) cemented these territorial gains setting the Araks as the border between Russia and Persia. However, Russia was far slower in consolidating its victories in the North Caucasus and faced a new uprising in the 1820s, led by the charismatic Avar, Shamil (Gammer, 1994). Shamil's resistance movement in the northeastern Caucasus endured for 30 years and, in the northwest, Russian ambitions were plagued by equally fierce resistance from Circassian communities (Henze, 1992). Not until 1864 did Russia manage to assert effective authority over the North Caucasus. Archaeology in the Russian Empire after the final consolidation of its new territories in the Caucasus and the northern Black Sea coast does not fit the traditional terms of the discipline's intellectual history in the West. In one sense, Russian archaeology was certainly imperialist in that it served to appropriate local prehistories to the glory of the empire through museums that followed the model of the Kunstkamera (cf. Lubbock, 1865; Squier &amp; Davis, 1848). However, unlike in America and Britain, archaeological evidence was generally not ^ Springer</page><page sequence="9">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 237 used as a justification for claims to racial or national superiority (Trigger, 1989, p. 210). The peoples of the conquered territories were not compressed into reductive social types and their prehistories were not reduced to a singular evolutionary sequence that rendered the empire as the triumphal culmination of historical process. Nor were nations ordered into a synchronic Aristotelian Great Chain of Being that might naturalize claims of Russian privilege over subordinated nationalities. Alternatively, Russian archaeology during the late nineteenth century might be described as antiquarian, in so far as excavations primarily constituted a method of collecting a diverse array of objects rather than a method for documenting variation within or between assem blages described in context (Lindsay and Smith, in press). Yet antiquarianism is also an insufficient term to describe the intellectual foundations of late nineteenth century archaeol ogy in the Russian empire. Only in the classical sites of the Black Sea coast did a historical record provide the defining reference point for artifact interpretation. Furthermore, Russian archaeology does not fit well within the model of nationalist archae ology that emerged during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, most notably in Germany. Indeed, ethnography and archaeology in the late nineteenth century played a pivotal role in pushing aside both the orientalizing literary romanticism and slavophilia that had threatened to position ethnic difference as the only salient source of cultural variation in Russian scholarship. The 1880s witnessed a number of key studies that emphasized the integration of Russian and "Asiatic" cultures rather than their essential distinction. D. N. Anuchin and N. I. Veselovsky argued that Paleolithic culture in Russia had been forged by deep "Tatar" influences (Veselovskii, 1900; cf. Munchaev, 1975). Similarly, the anthropol ogist Dmitry Zelenin (1991) argued that elements of Russian folk traditions?such as fever charms and protections against the evil eye?derived from analogous practices in Siberia and Mongolia. In the influential volume Russkaya Drevnosti v Pamiatnikakh Iskusstva, Ivan Tolstoi and Nikidim Kondakov (1889) defined the relation between the Russian nation and its antiquities in terms that precluded the simplistic formulations offered by nationalist culture-historians in Europe, such as Gustav Kossina: In the course of two and a half thousand years many tribes and nationalities had been living and working for the creation of historical memory within the borders of our fatherland. And the more varied has been the ethnic composition (plemennoi sostav) of the population, and the longer it has taken to create one state with a single nation (edinyi narod), the greater has been the contribution of [these nationalities] to the treasury of Russian antiquities (Tolstoi &amp; Kondakov, 1889, p. iii; translation from Tolz, 2005, p. 134). Russian archaeology?particularly among the academic orientalists?forwarded a dis tinctly pluralist model of national formation that saw strong local traditions as contributors to the formation of Russian grazhdanstvennosf or civilization, rather than as roadblocks to the formation of a Russian national program. Nikolai Marr (see below) situated this per spective explicitly in relation to the nationalities of the South Caucasus, arguing that "the [Russian] state has all the more reason to regard Armenian and Georgian studies as an edu cational tool_Who can deny the fact... that one who is indifferent to the plight of one's own region cannot deeply embrace a more abstract and complex feeling for the fatherland" (Marr, 1899, p. 244; Tolz, 2005, p. 140). However, it is important to note that although early Russian archaeological thought largely resisted slavophilia and the narratives of genealogical purity that so compromised nation alist archaeology in Europe, it was no less captivated by the mosaic geography of cultural history. This archaeological vision found its most coherent expression in the formalist and ^ Springer</page><page sequence="10">238 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 empirical schools of Vasily Gorodtsov and Aleksandr Spitsyn. Both Gorodtsov and Spitsyn were more preoccupied with locating distinct archaeological cultures cartographically in space than in evolutionary time. Although Gorodtsov (1927) was concerned to define histor ical sequences of artifactual change, he was reticent to link such transformations to ethnic or cultural transformations. For example, his division of the Bronze Age on the Eurasian Steppe predicated each epoch upon shifts in grave type?from pit (yamnaya), to catacomb (katakombnaya), to timber (srubnaya) grave cultures?yet provided no account of the forces driving change between the phases (Gorodtsov, 1905). As a result, Russian archaeologists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were less committed to the evolutionary nar ratives that gripped the imaginations of their European counterparts. While France, England, and Germany waged ugly contests over claims to the legacy of the ancient world (waged in philology, archaeology, anthropology, and competitive museology), Russian archaeology focused primarily on form, periodization, and aesthetics. Disciplining archaeology in southern Caucasia The first general survey of the ancient monuments of the Armenian Highland was initiated not in Moscow, but in Venice by Ghevond Alishan. Alishan corresponded with teachers in seveeral of Armenia's provinces to create detailed lists of known sites. The result was a series of regional studies that treated ancient ruins as potential sources for understanding the historical formation of the Armenian Highland (e.g., Alishan, 1881, 1899). Yet only with the arrival of the Russian imperial bureaucracy in cities such as Tiflis (Tbilisi), Baku, and Aleksandropol (Giumri), did formal institutions of archaeological investigation begin work in the region. The 1850s saw the initial emergence of the primary imperial and local institutions that would come to dominate archaeological research and exhibition in the South Caucasus. The Imperial Archaeological Society (founded in St. Petersburg in 1851) and the Imperial Archaeological Commission (IAK, founded 1859) oversaw much of the initial fieldwork in the region. In 1852, the Russian Imperial Geographic Society opened a Caucasian department in Tbilisi and held the first exhibition of antiquities and ethnographic materials from the region in 1855. The department amassed a sizable antiquities collection during the next decade thanks to private donations from collectors such as Rafael Eristavi, Vladimir Sollogub, Gabriel Tokarev, Friedrich Bayern, and Adolf Berzhe. In 1864, the Caucasian department was shuttered and its collections became the foundation for the Kavkazskii Musei (Museum of the Caucasus) which opened in Tbilisi three years later. The first programmatic excavations in the South Caucasus were conducted in 1871 when E. Yeritsov (a.k.a. Yeritsyan) opened 23 "pre-Christian" burials at Akner, in the Debed river canyon. Yeritsov's report in the newspaper Kavkaz (September 1871) marks the first publication of the results of archaeological research in Caucasia. That same year, the Austrian scholar Friedrich Bayern began his investigations of the cemeteries at Samtavro (Fig. 2), near Mtskheta (Bayern, 1885; Abramishvili, 2003). New building projects throughout Caucasia resulted in the discovery and exploration of several major sites. For example, construction of a Russian military base in Aleksandropol uncovered an "ancient" burial at Sev Amrots (Black Fortress). G. D. Filimonov collected the materials from the disturbed tomb, which included bronze swords, daggers, and arrowheads, and published them in 1876. Similarly, construction of a road between Akstaf and Dilijan in 1850 uncovered a large cemetery at Redkin-Lager (named for the construction engineer on the project) and in 1879, Bayern examined 86 burials at the site. In his publication of the Redkin-Lager materials, Bayern (1882) offered the first effort at a regional archaeological sequence for the Caucasus, arguing ^ Springer</page><page sequence="11">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 239 Fig. 2 Major archaeological sites explored in the South Caucasus from the eighteenth to twentieth centuries that the materials from the site pre-date the pit-burials at Samtavro. The materials from Koban (in the North Caucasus) and the Qazbegi sites in Georgia, he suggested, represent more recent phases within the same sequence (Abramishvili, 2003, p. 12). A regional branch of the Imperial Archaeological Commission was established in Tbilisi during the 1880s, providing a direct stimulus to research and access to the first scholarly jour nal of archaeological research in Russia?the IAK's Otchetke Arkheologicheskogo Komissii (OAK). Participation in the Caucasus branch of the IAK was interestingly diverse. In contrast to Russia proper, where archaeologists largely emerged from the ranks of military officers and aristocrats, the oil boom on the Apsheron peninsula during the 1870s brought a wave European and Russian entrepreneurs, engineers, scholars, and travelers into the region, providing an unusual intellectual cosmopolitanism that drew the Caucasus into a wider archaeological world. The position of Caucasian antiquities within Russian imperial archaeology was formal ized in 1880 when the IAK dispatched Yeritsov and Count Uvarov to the region in advance of the fifth archaeological congress, to be held in Tbilisi the following year. Uvarov excavated small soundings at the site of Armavir in the Ararat Plain, led there by an Urartian cuneiform ^ Springer</page><page sequence="12">240 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 inscription discovered in 1869 (Martirosyan, 1974). The 1881 congress stimulated consid erable interest within the local intelligentsia in the antiquities of the South Caucasus. Rudolf Virchow's (1882) report on the conference proceedings, published in Berlin, effectively in troduced the emerging archaeology of the Caucasus as a regional specialty for European scholars. The 1881 congress marked the advent of an increasingly professionalized archaeology in the Caucasus, highlighted by a developing self-consciousness regarding field methods and an expanding interest in understanding artifacts in relation to complete assemblages rather than as isolated objets dart. While traditional forms of collecting continued to drive some excavations well into the early years of the twentieth century, including the work of E. Rosier (1900 at Sev Amrots, 1904 at Karmir-Berd), P. Charkovsky (1896 at Karmir-Berd), M. Zacharyants (1903 at Karmir-Berd) and others, an increasingly professional group of archaeologists emerged in parallel. Bayern's early reflections on the periodization of Redkin-Lager and Samtavro established a new concern for material chronologies, stimulating considerable debate over the relative dating of major mortuary complexes (Chantre, 1885; Virchow, 1883). These arguments over relative chronologies were based almost entirely upon presumptions of aesthetic development embedded in Gorodtsov's formalist analytical tradition. That is, "primitive" styles marked by less accomplished craftsmanship were presumed to be earlier than more "developed" styles (hence, for example, pit burials predated tombs with stone chambers). The problem of anchoring relative sequences to absolute calendar dates was taken up in 1887 when Jacques de Morgan excavated 898 Iron Age burials in the Debed canyon (de Morgan, 1997). Morgan was an engineer at the Alaverdi copper mines and, in the tradition of amateur antiquarians, undertook excavations at nearby sites. However, Morgan proved to have far broader archaeological interests, publishing several synthetic works during a long career of travel, excavation, and collecting across southwest Asia. Morgan's (1889) masterful publication, Mission Scientifique au Caucase is divided into 14 chronological eras from "les Origines" through "les Temps Modernes." Each period is illustrated by extant archaeological materials contextualized in reference to topographical maps of sites, drawings of major complexes (particularly burial chambers), and roughly contemporary materials from neighboring locales. Morgan's report was the first to position the Caucasus firmly within a broad history of the ancient Near East, closely articulating the region with major transformations in the societies of Mesopotamia, Persia, and the eastern Mediterranean. In order to suggest absolute dates for sites in the Caucasus, Morgan cited formal similarities with artifacts from neighboring areas. As a result of Morgan's work, stylistic parallels with materials from the Near East and Mediterranean have provided the primary foundation for absolute dating in the South Caucasus, even after the arrival of radiometric dating techniques. For example, arguments over the dating of Samtavro burials alone have called upon Mycenean and Hittite (Nioradze, 1931), Urartian (Kuftin, 1941) and Scythian (Abramishvili, 2003; Lomtatidze, 1974) parallels. Despite an increasing attention to excavation method, periodization (through stylistic analyses of ceramic and metal artifacts), the integrity of discrete assemblages, and a more formal sense of proper scholarly credentials (largely promoted by the IAK in Moscow), by the end of the nineteenth century, archaeology in the South Caucasus, was limited in its intellectual development by several factors. In particular, lingering antiquarian priorities focused attention almost exclusively upon cemetery contexts. Mortuary sites offered re markable artifacts suitable for museum displays, but they generally lacked the stratigraphic relationships amongst complexes necessary to define temporal sequences of materials. As a Springer</page><page sequence="13">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 241 result, regional chronologies remained poorly defined (for example, any find of a stone tool was presumed to date a site to the Neolithic period). Only Bayern showed any interest in correlating materials across sites; and only Morgan strove to situate Caucasian discoveries within a broad historical narrative of the ancient world. Despite these limitations, archaeol ogy in the South Caucasus was, in the last decade of the nineteenth century, on the verge of a radical transformation, largely driven by the investigations of Nikolai Marr at the Medieval Armenian capital of Ani. The Marr school Marr's investigations at Ani were a watershed in the history of archaeological research in the South Caucasus. Raised in Georgia and trained in philology in the Department of Oriental Languages at St. Petersburg University, Marr's interest in the site of Ani was sparked by two historical issues. First, Ani was the only major historically attested early Armenian capital in Caucasia whose location was well-known. Earlier capitals, such as Artashat and Dvin, had not yet been securely identified. Second, Ani represented for Marr a point of enduring cultural confluence, a meeting place of Christian and Islamic worlds which, for a period in its long history, hosted a collaborative Georgian and Armenian principality. The site thus provided a potent location for advancing his theories of pluralist national formation (see above) in the context of the specific ties between the South Caucasus and the Near East. The cosmopolitanism of ancient Ani also provided an appropriate metaphor for the collaborative redefinition of archaeological fieldwork that was to emerge from the investigations of Marr and his students. The first season of excavations at Ani was conducted in 1892 (field seasons at Ani con tinued in 1893 and then ran in earnest from 1904-1917). Instead of investigating the site in isolation, he combined excavations at the city with an unsystematic regional survey of major monuments on the western and northern slopes of Mt. Aragats. During this survey, Marr documented numerous "cyclopean" fortresses (such as Pemzashen and Garnaovit) and "pagan" cemeteries (including Kaftarlu [Panik] and Parnigegh [Anushavan]). Like his prede cessors, Marr focused his excavations of prehistoric sites primarily on cemeteries (including a large-scale investigation of the graves at Vornak). However, the effort to understand Ani in relation to nearby historic and prehistoric monuments marked a significant move away from the traditional focus on isolated sites that had limited earlier work in the Caucasus (Marr, 1990). In addition, his concern to document both cemeteries and settlements suggests an in creasing complexity to archaeological practice and heightened ambitions for archaeology's role in historical reconstruction. Marr's approach to archaeological interpretation was strongly shaped by his philological training and interests in historical linguistics. In 1915 he forwarded a strong theoretical attack on the aristocratic pretensions of European humanism, rooted in the emerging school of Russian culture history. European humanism, he complained, presumes a single model of cultural achievement, rendered in the image of the Great Powers, and a singular narrative of historical development that culminated in Victorian industrialism. Marr advocated a new form of scientific history of world civilization built on a close understanding of particular national histories. The histories of ancient nations, he argued, shows that not only Europeans can claim a part in the development of world culture. Every nation, large or small, makes significant contributions to human history (Marr, 1995, p. 54). It is tempting to read Marr's resistance to the "just-so" stories of nineteenth century European humanism as an intellectual twin to the critiques of cultural evolutionism advanced ^ Springer</page><page sequence="14">242 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 by Man's contemporary in the United States, Franz Boas. Both shared a commitment to cultural relativism and historical particularism. However, as Marr moved away from his archaeological research to immerse himself in his own approach to historical linguistics, he moved into a form of social evolutionism that embraced the relations between economic and social formation defined by Karl Marx (particularly after the Bolshevik revolution) even as he eschewed the liberal imperialism of Herbert Spencer. Following the revolution, Marr ceased his archaeological investigations to concentrate on the linguistic research which made him one of the most influential scientists of the early Soviet Union. But Marr's most lasting contributions to archaeology in the South Caucasus were his students. The Marr School included many young scholars who would become the leading lights of the next generation in fields ranging from architectural history (Toros Toramanyan) to philology (Iosef Orbelli) to archaeology (Ashkharbeck Kalantar) to medieval history (Nikolai Tokarsky). It was the Marr School that provided the foundation for uniquely vibrant indigenous traditions of archaeological scholarship in Georgia and Armenia that dominated twentieth century research in the region. Marr's multi-disciplinary approach to archaeological inquiry and his concern to investi gate not simply sites, but regions, strongly shaped the priorities and activities of his students. Beginning in 1914, while still a participant in the research at Ani, Toramanyan (1942,1948) compiled a catalog of the major architectural monuments of Armenia. While his emphasis was primarily on the remains and ruins of Medieval buildings (particularly churches), he also carefully documented a large number of earlier settlements, including the remains of large fortified citadels, and, on occasion, cemeteries (most notably the kurgans at Oshakan). Toramanyan's research provided the first comprehensive descriptions of the extant architec ture at historic and prehistoric sites that were to later host major archaeological investigations, including Tsaghkahovit, Horom, Aragats, Shamiram, Oshakan, Dovri, and Metsamor. However encyclopedic Toramanyan's records were, his work was not simply an extrapo lation of antiquarian forms of cataloguing. He also strove to frame architecture as a source for understanding past social worlds. In his description of Horom, for example, Toramanyan (1942, p. 18-21) details at some length the contrast between the skilled semi-ashlar masonry and well-carpentered fortifications on the north hill and the irregular, largely unworked stone defenses of the south hill. These formal and aesthetic distinctions, he argued, reflected the basic class order of the ancient city, with the elite quartered inside the north hill's elegant walls and the commoner class enclosed within the south hill's more haphazard constructions. Although subsequent work at Horom (Badaljan, Edens, Kohl, &amp; Tonikijan, 1992; Badaljan et ai, 1993; Badaljan, Kohl, Stronach, &amp; Tonikian, 1994; Badaljan, Kohl, &amp; Kroll, 1997) found the distinction between the hills to be chronological rather than sociological (the south hill was built during the Late Bronze Age and the north during the Urartian era), the effort to utilize architectural remains as a key to social reconstruction was a unique contribution to the interpretive repertoire of archaeological theory in the Caucasus. Ashkharbeck Kalantar, another graduate of Marr's Ani school, shared Toramanyan's am bition to compile regional site catalogs. However, unlike Marr and Toramanyan, Kalantar's regional investigations, particularly those he conducted on the southern slope of Mt. Aragats and the western slopes of the Gegham range, were the first to explore the archaeological landscape more broadly through the interconnections between sites (Kalantar, 1994). Kalantar's initial surveys were similar in practice and scope to those conducted by Marr. In 1912, Kalantar was dispatched by the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences to the Imirzek (Vanstan), Surmalu, and Lori regions to record the major monuments, inscriptions, and sites of each region. But by the 1920s, Kalantar had substantially augmented the traditional parameters of the regional cataloging survey that had been the primary mode of practice ^ Springer</page><page sequence="15">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 243 since the previous century. Moving away from the fortresses and cemeteries that were the primary preoccupation of Bronze Age archaeology, he began to look at patterning in inter-related archaeological phenomena. In mapping the ancient canals that he found on the Aragats and Gegham slopes, Kalantar not only established a new archaeological interest in ancient irrigation networks (several decades before Karl Wittfogel [1957] would focus the attention of Near Eastern archaeologists on irrigation facilities in Mesopotamia), he also argued that these features must be understood as part of the economic systems that supported Bronze Age fortified settlements which he believed integrated into a broad-scale regional landscape. Kalantar's precocious work effectively introduced the concept of settlement patterns to archaeology in the South Caucasus and pushed archaeological interpretations toward more complex models of economy and production. The later years of the Ani investigations (concluded in 1917) were tumultuous times that deeply impacted the conduct of archaeological research in southern Caucasia, its institutional locations, and its interpretive priorities. The expansion of World War I beyond Europe to incorporate a contest in the South Caucasus between Russia and the Ottoman empire brought with it the unfathomable horrors of the Armenian Genocide and the brief emergence of the independent republics of Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. In general, archaeological research was halted during the War, with the notable exception of the excavations that Marr and Orbelli (1922) conducted in 1916 at Van Kale just behind the Russian-Ottoman front. With the creation of the Armenian Republic and its capital at Yerevan, two new institutions were founded that would come to shape archaeological research in the twentieth century: Yerevan State University and Yerevan State Museum. In 1919, Kalantar left his post as Keeper of the Asiatic Museum in St. Petersburg and became one of the founding members of the new University in Yerevan. With the advances of the Red Army into the South Caucasus and the formation of the new Transcaucasian Socialist Republics, the Yerevan Museum and University were reconstituted within the framework of a new Soviet Armenia. From the end of 1920 to March 1922, the South Caucasus experienced considerable political tumult in contests between Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, and rearguard nationalists. On December 10, 1922, Armenia was incorporated as a republic within a single Transcaucasian Federated Soviet Socialist Republic (ZSFSR), along with Georgia and Azerbaijan, which three weeks later was admitted as a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Suny, 1993a: 216). Alongside these institutions, a new Commission for the Preservation of Antiquities was founded in Yerevan in 1923 as part of the Peoples Kommissariat of Education. The following year, the Armenian Institute of Science and Art was inaugurated, putting in place the last of the four major institutions that continue to the present to shape archaeological research in Armenia. Culture-history and historical materialism, 1924-1959 Between 1924 and 1939, the four major institutional locations for archaeology in the Armenian S.S.R.?Yerevan State University, Yerevan State Museum, the Commission for the Preservation of Antiquities, and the Institute of Science and Art?underwent numerous episodes of reorganization and renaming. In 1930, a department of archaeology was founded within the University with Kalantar as its first director. Two years later, the Institute of Science and Art was renamed the Institute of the Material Culture of Armenia, only to be reorganized again in 1937 when the Armenian branch of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. was established, subsuming all research institutes under its auspices. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="16">244 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 However, the tumult that repeated renaming and reorganization created for the major institutions of archaeological research pales in comparison to the personal misfortunes that Stalinism brought with it. Amongst the many archaeologists sent to the Gulag during the purges were Kalantar (arrested in 1938, he died in prison in 1942), and Evgenii Baiburtyan. Baiburtyan trained at Moscow State University in the archaeological branch of the Depart ment of Ethnology, completing his degree in 1925 under Gorodtsov's direction. Throughout the late 1920s and 1930s, Baiburtyan conducted excavations at numerous prehistoric sites in Armenia, including Giumri (in 1929), Elar (in 1928), Shresh Blur (in 1935), and Shengavit (from 1936 to 38). In each of these excavations, Baiburtyan used close control over stratigra phy and stylistic sedation of ceramics to develop a sense of the methodological parameters necessary for formulating a close periodization of archaeological sites (Baiburtyan, 1937). Baiburtyan's most lasting contribution to regional archaeology developed out of his work at Shengavit (Baiburtyan, 1938). Wedding his own formalist sense of material culture to a broader understanding of regional comparative investigation stimulated by the Man* School, Baiburtyan proposed that Shengavit represented an early florescence of a single archaeological culture?the Kura-Araxes. Sadly, on the day before Baiburtyan was to defend his dissertation outlining the parameters of this new culture-historical formulation, he was arrested and sent to Siberia (Piotrovskii, 1995). The formulation of Marxist culture-history While the Stalinist attacks upon intellectuals entailed catastrophic losses to the field of archaeology, there is perhaps one serendipitous moment. Boris Kuftin started his career in St. Petersburg, but following his arrest and exile to the peripheries he landed in Tbilisi. During the years that Kuftin spent in Georgia, he examined some of the most noteworthy sites of the prehistoric Caucasus, including Ozni-Beshtasheni and the Trialeti kurgans. But Kuftin's most lasting impact was his clear articulation of a culture-historical approach to Caucasian prehistory. Kuftin (1943,1946) was the first to systematize the investigations of the previous half century into a spatially extensive and chronologically delimited periodization of integrated culture groups. Highly influenced by the early work of V. Gordon Childe in Europe, Kuftin outlined a series of historically successive culture-areas that were unified by shared material culture forms and styles. The fluorescence of the Kura-Araxes culture, he proposed, was marked archaeologically by a remarkably homogeneous repertoire of black burnished ceramics with red/brown interiors (Kuftin, 1943). In some respects, the ingredients for a culture-historical approach focused on locating material types in space and time had been part of regional investigations since Marr. Kuftin's primary innovation was his move away from narod (people, or nation) as the organizing unit of material production to embrace kuVtura (culture). In so far as it was mobilized to describe the relation between material culture and socio-economic life, the culture concept provided early Soviet archaeology with a conceptual locus for defining a materialist prehistory that understood homogeneity across artifact assemblages as the result of shared relations of production rather than shared perceptions of national identity. And yet, national character remained deeply embedded in the culture concept. Kuftin's culture-history made a lasting impact upon archaeology in the Caucasus as it established a comparative method and a singular vocabulary for framing individual sites and artifacts in relation to a far larger corpus. But with major archaeological cultures defined as the primary subjects of archaeological interpretation there remained two considerable intellectual problems. The first was the problem of historical transformation within and between the phases of this new schema. The arrival of historical materialism, in the form of ^ Springer</page><page sequence="17">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 245 Marxism-Leninism, provided both a clear model of social evolution and a theoretical defense for the study of economy as the foundation for all social change. As in other parts of the world, the privileging of evolution in historical interpretation carried with it the concomitant denunciation of migration and diffusion despite considerable evidence that large and small scale population movements were powerful forces in the social history of the Caucasus. The second problem that followed on the new culture-historical approach was the ar ticulation of prehistoric culture-areas with contemporary national groups. Unlike the direct historical approach defined by A. V. Kidder (1924) in the U.S. southwest to push the histo ries of ethnographically known groups back into the prehistoric past, culture-history in the South Caucasus started the other way around; it first established prehistoric culture-areas as primordial loci of ethnogenesis, leaving the far more difficult ground of protohistoric connec tions to contemporary nationalities of the U.S.S.R. open to intense, and often ill-informed, speculation. The influence of Marr's theory of linguistic transformation provided a further bulwark to envisioning all existing peoples of the U.S.S.R. as essentially autochthonous. As a result of Marrism: ... the most ancient populations became an unmoving autochthnous mass that from time to time experienced incredible transformations in culture and language in response to changes in technology. For example, in the Crimea, Japhetic-speaking Cimmerians became Iranian-speaking Scythians, who in turn became German-speaking Goths, and finally Slavs (Bulkin, Klejn, &amp; Lebedev, 1982, p. 275). Both of these issues came to the center of southern Caucasian archaeology in the work of Boris Piotrovskii. Historical materialism in practice: The impact of Karmir-Blur and Garni Piotrovskii was trained in St. Petersburg where his interests gravitated toward the ancient Near East, particularly Egypt and later Assyria. It was this interest in the ancient Near East that brought him initially to the Caucasus in the 1930s where he hoped to explore the links between Near Eastern civilizations and the southernmost territories of the U.S.S.R. (Piotrovskii, 1995). Piotrovskii's initial work included surveys similar to those conducted by Kalantar, documenting cyclopean fortresses in the Aragats region and the Sevan basin (Adzhan, Gyuzalian, &amp; Piotrovskii, 1932; Piotrovskii &amp; Gyuzalian, 1933). When, in 1936, an Urartian cuneiform inscription was uncovered at the site of Karmir-Blur, on the outskirts of Yerevan, Piotrovskii initiated what was to become the largest and longest-lived excavation project ever conducted in southern Caucasia. Like Marr at Ani, the excavations at Karmir-Blur (ancient Teisheba URU), became the primary training ground for a new generation of archaeologists. Steeped in the new models of culture-history, the graduates of Piotrovskii's school emerged with a strong, if largely implicit, theory of the role of economy in driving social and political transformation. Piotro vskii's historical thought generally fits well within the prevailing Marxist theoretical current that served as analytical dogma within the Stalinist period. But Piotrovskii's attention to Urartian political economy was also driven in large part by the fact that what survived at Karmir-Blur were vast arrays of large storage rooms. To excavate Karmir-Blur and not fo cus on political economy would have seemed rather perverse. Although Piotrovskii wrote extensively about Urartian art, politics, and social life, the economy of empire remained the foundation upon which superstructural elements were predicated. While it may be tempt ing to note the parallel form of economic functionalism that developed concurrently in England, particularly in Grahame Clark's (1954) work at Starr Carr, Piotrovskii did not strive ^ Springer</page><page sequence="18">246 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 to understand economics as an adaptation to a physical environment. Rather, the economies of ancient empires like Urartu were of an evolutionary type that arose from the internal order of social classes and the logics of production, not from the regulatory mechanisms of natural environments. At the same time that Piotrovskii was excavating Karmir-Blur, Babken Arakelyan (Arakelyan, 1951) undertook a similarly large-scale investigation at the site of Garni, in the western Gegham foothills. The site attracted Arakelyan's attention when a Greek inscription was found in the area. Visible remains of monumental Greco-Roman architecture had been reported at the site since the late nineteenth century (and indeed, the initial publications generated by the Garni investigations of Arakelyan, Smirnov, and others dealt exclusively with the philology of the Greek inscription, effectively ignoring the archaeology of the site). But the occupations at Garni spanned a broad horizon from the third millennium BC through the first millennium AD. Thus, unlike the single-period occupation being examined by Piotrovskii at the fortress of Karmir-Blur, the investigations at Garni provided a vast historical canvas on which to write. As a result, a similarly skilled team of scholars worked and trained on Arakelyan's project, including Gevork Tiratsyan, Zhores Khachatrian, and Emma Khanzadian. But Arakelyan's research interest at Garni focused primarily on the Classical-period Armenian kingdoms and their ties to countervailing cultural currents emanating from the south (Parthia) and the west (Rome). Along with Garni, his succeeding projects at Armavir (1962-1969) and Artashat (beginning in 1970 and continuing to the present under the direction of Khachatrian) have largely defined the archaeology of ancient Armenia during the late first millennium BC and early first millennium AD. The generation of students that trained at Karmir-Blur and Garni, including H. Martirosyan, Stepan Esaian, T. Khachatrian, and Khanzadian, was the first to under take synthetic accounts of the economic bases for shifts in prehistoric and early historic culture history. Martirosyan (1964) in particular offered one of the most insightful accounts of both the archaeological composition of major culture-historical groupings and the forces driving their rise and fall. Similarly, his work at the Urartian city of Argishtihinili (1974) set the city within the far wider currents of urban sociology and political economy. In 1959, the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology was separated from the Institute of History within the structure of the Armenian Academy of Sciences and Arakelyan was appointed its first director. The moment was salutary in that it marked the realization of archaeological research as a discrete disciplinary tradition within Caucasian scientific insti tutions. But the date can also be read more broadly as the beginning of another generational shift in Caucasian archaeology. With the death of Stalin in 1953, the most dangerous and tumultuous period of research in the U.S.S.R. came to an end. And with the new decade of the 1960s, the students of Piotrovskii and Arakelyan became major driving forces in both research and theory. Strange bedfellows: From materialist archaeology to national archaeologies, 1959-1980 Writing an overview of the problems and priorities that oriented archaeological thought in Armenia during the 1960s and 1970s is exceedingly difficult. In one sense it is easy to compile a list of the major archaeological projects of this era and the historical periods that they targeted. Khachatrian's (1963, 1975, 1979) investigations of Bronze Age remains at Harich and Artik, Khanzadian's long-term exploration of Bronze and Early Iron Age levels at Metsamor (Khanzadian, 1995; Khanzadian, Mkrtchian, &amp; Parsamian, 1973), Elar ^ Springer</page><page sequence="19">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 247 (Khanzadian, 1979), and Jrahovit, Martirosyan's (1974) excavations at Argishtihinili, Arakelyan, Tiratsyan, and Khachatrian's research into the Yervandid and Artaxiad periods at Armavir (Tiratsyan, 1973,1976,1988) and Artashat (Arakelyan, 1975,1982; Khachatryan, 1981) and the long-term investigation of the Medieval Armenian capital at Dvin by S. V. Der-Avetisyan, Karapet Kafadaryan, and Aram Kalantaryan (Karakhanyan et al., 2002; Kalantaryan, 1976, 1996), were major projects that still provide the key material assemblages which structure artifact typologies and site periodizations. Unfortunately, this list provides little orientation to the primary theoretical concepts that guided what was by then a mature Soviet archaeology. As in most other world traditions of archaeological research, many of these sites received the attention they did because they were large (in some cases, historically known "capital" cities) and offered remarkable potential to recover art historical treasures as well as imported goods. However, in a less superficial sense, it is important to note that the major excavations of the era targeted sites that represented the apogee of their given archaeological period. That is, none of these sites, with the possible exception of Metsamor, provides us with a sense of socio-cultural development and transformation over time. Rather, they represent the "high-water" marks of their eras (Lindsay and Smith, in press). The inevitable result was a close account of the most highly elaborated traits of a given era but very little attention to how each era folded into its successor or emerged from its antecedents. As discussed below, this had serious consequences for the anthropological issues that grounded archaeological interpretation. But most immediately, it established a historiographic approach that was pre-occupied with the exceptional at the expense of the more typical, the center at the expense of the margins, the elite at the expense of the common, the fully developed at the expense of the emergent. In other words, 1959-1980 in southern Caucasia was an era of "great site" archaeology. It should quickly be pointed out that there is nothing inherently wrong with this approach, particularly at a time in the archaeology of the region when establishing basic frameworks for periodization remained critical to advancing archaeological research. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this approach as well. As great sites came to dominate field research, they were often read as microcosms for historical trends within broad regional zones. While the preceding decades of regional re search had shown little concern for delimiting archaeological zones in relation to geographic distinctions, during the 1970s Armenia was effectively partitioned into a series of discrete archaeological provinces: the Shirak Plain, the Ararat Plain, the Sevan Basin, the moun tainous northeast, and Syunik in the south. However, there was little consensus as to how an account of regional transformations might be defined through archaeological research. Khachatrian (1975) based his seminal Drevnaya Kultura Shiraka on excavations at just two sites, Harich for its Early Bronze Age settlement and Middle Bronze burials and Artik, a large Late Bronze Age cemetery. But he examined these two sites at a very large scale (for example, his excavations at Artik opened 640 catacomb burials). Esaian (1976), working in northeastern Armenia, and Xnkikyan (2002), working in the Syunik area to the south, also penned regional synthetic volumes. In contrast, their work documented a large number of sites from the Bronze Age through the Iron Age, but the scale of their investigations at any one site was quite limited. These regional investigations are extremely valuable for the record they provide of major monuments. But neither of these approaches to archaeological research design were based upon well-theorized accounts of how to read regional trends from localized data. As a result, no systematic methodologies for regional survey were developed. As in America and Europe, the 1970s saw the increasing application of natural science techniques to archaeology in the U.S.S.R. and the South Caucasus in particular. Volumes on ^ Springer</page><page sequence="20">248 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 the spectral analysis of metal artifacts (Gevorkyan, 1980) and fauna! remains (Mezhlumyan, 1972) effectively broadened the analytical approaches available to archaeology. But despite these significant additions to the repertoire of archaeological analysis, very little changed in the discipline's interpretive priorities. The chronologies and periodizations forwarded by Martirosyan in the 1960s continued to be used, even though mounting evidence suggested the necessity for re-evaluation. Furthermore, the same form of basic historical materialism that developed in both Piotrovskii's and Martirosyan's writing remained the end of most interpretation. An important theoretical trend of the 1970s was the emergence of a new interest in the impact of environmental changes on human settlement and land use (e.g., Kushnareva &amp; Chubinishvili, 1970). These ecological approaches proved particularly useful in bridging theories of human migration (long thought too contingent to fit into Marxist-Leninist his tory) with evolutionary accounts of archaeological transformation. Unfortunately, there was no concomitant effort to produce environmental reconstructions that might support such assertions. As a result, ecological change became simply a convenient, intelligible source of rapid cultural transition but never itself an object of inquiry. Even as archaeological practice and interpretation in the South Caucasus, and the U.S.S.R. more generally, embraced natural science techniques and explanatory models?paralleling similar moves by the New Archaeology in the United States (e.g., Binford, 1965; Clarke, 1968; Flannery, 1967)?it was pulled inexorably into the intellectual transformations at work in Soviet nationalities policy. It is worth noting that the Bolshevik Sovietization of the Caucasus entailed a reaffirmation of the salience of national difference within the context of proletariat brotherhood, not a dissolution of nationalist false consciousness (Marx &amp; Engels, 1978, p. 488). While Piatakov and Bukharin argued against vesting the self-determination of Soviet peoples in "some fictitious so-called 'national will'" (Martin, 2003, p. 94), Lenin believed that by acceding to local aspirations to nationhood within a federative socialist republic, particularly on the tenuous peripheries of the old Empire, the Bolsheviks could divide local all-class nationalist parties and foster the ultimate formation of an abstract proletariat consciousness. In other words, the nationalities policies in place as the republics of the South Caucasus were brought into the Soviet Union in 1920 and 1921 effectively adopted the position Marr had championed at the end of the nineteenth century: "... humanity can only arrive at the inevitable fusion (sliianie) of nations through a transitional period of complete freedom of all oppressed nationalities" (Lenin, 1928, p. 425). As a result, "Rather than a melting pot, the Soviet Union became the incubator of new nations" (Suny, 1993b, p. 87). The U.S.S.R. was unique in that its multi-ethnic structure was predicated upon the re vocation of political sovereignty for nations even as it reproduced nationalities through a territorial order predicated on ethnicity, educational and cultural institutions that fostered local languages and traditions, and what Terri Martin (2001) has termed "affirmative action" policies that elevated non-Russians to senior positions. Under Stalin, Russification effec tively diminished national institutions and sentiments as collectivization, the forced teaching of Russian, conscription in the Red Army, the shared traumas of the gulag and the Great Patriotic War, and the dissemination of the cult of personality did much to forge a sense of Soviet identity. But with Stalin's death in 1953, "patriotic" expressions of national spirit were tolerated and encouraged even as separatist movements for national political autonomy were suppressed. It is in this context that archaeology in the 1960s and 1970s came to play a vital role in distinguishing the patriotic from the nationalist. In Armenia, the deployment in public architecture of motifs derived from the iconographic repertoires of the first millennium ^ Springer</page><page sequence="21">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 249 B.C. Urartian empire certainly constituted one way in which archaeology was drawn into the project of national memorialization. But the priorities of great site archaeology also reflect the larger agenda of Soviet nationalities policy. Excavations at Karmir-Blur, Armavir (1962-present), Garni (1949-present), and Artashat (1970-present) constituted the flagship expeditions of Armenia's archaeological community during the 1960s through the 1980s (although excavations technically continue at these sites, the constriction of funds has greatly reduced the scale of investigations since 1991). The large-scale restoration of the Urartian site of Erebuni in the early 1970s (to mark the 2,750th anniversary of the founding of Yerevan) and the reconstructon of the Greco-Roman monument at Garni in the 1960s, both bolstered Soviet programs of national memorialization. However, it is not coincidental that these sites allowed for the development of forms of "tourist patriotism" that highlighted the accomplishments of a nation even as they studiously avoided providing a rallying point for nationalism. Crisis, transition, and tradition, 1980-present The last twenty-five years of archaeological research in Caucasia has produced a significant transformation in archaeological research practice. In Armenia, a new generation of students have embarked upon a concerted revision of Martirosyan's chronologies and periodization, utilizing new stratigraphic data and a slowly increasing battery of radiocarbon dates to buttress their arguments. In particular, Gevork Areshian's work in the 1980s sparked a broad re-evaluation of the sequences and structures that had long ordered archaeology in Armenia. Furthermore, smaller sites and peripheries moved to the foreground of research. For example, the most recent major excavations at Urartian sites in Armenia were those conducted at Horom (Badaljan et al, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997), Aragats (Avetisyan, 1996, 2001), Aramus (Avetisyan, 1997) and Oshakan (Kalantaryan et ai, 2003). Both Aragats and Oshakan were small outposts in the center of the Ararat plain. And although Horom is quite large, it does not appear to have been a typical Urartian center but rather an oddly gargantuan frontier site, perhaps even administered by an allied local ruler rather than directly by an Urartian governor. It is certainly true that one of the major factors driving recent shifts in archaeological research in the South Caucasus has been the funding crisis precipitated by the collapse of the Soviet Union, wars in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and south Ossetia, the devastating earthquake of 1988 in Armenia, and the region's precarious economies. These socio-political transformations provide the context for what has been a no less transformative era in the his tory of archaeological thought. In Georgia and Azerbaijan, the advent of salvage archaeology, necessitated by the construction of oil pipelines, has provided considerable support for ar chaeology at a truly difficult time and provided new datasets (e.g., Licheli, 2003) from along the surveyed corridor. Salvage archaeology is less-developed in Armenia where large-scale international construction projects have been far fewer than in the neighboring republics; however, Esaian and Kalantaryan's recent work at Oshakan following the illegal construction of a cell-phone transmittal tower does stand as a model for future CRM investigations. The arrival of collaborative international research programs has also played a consid erable role in recent shifts in regional theory and practice. The collaborative Armenian American Project for the Archaeology and Geography of Ancient Transcaucasian Societies (Project ArAGATS), which Ruben Badalyan and I founded in 1995, is presently the longest lived international research program in the region (Avetisyan, Badalyan, &amp; Smith, 2000; Badalyan, Smith, &amp; Avetisyan, 2003; Smith, 1996; Smith &amp; Badalyan, n.d.; Smith, Badalyan, ^ Springer</page><page sequence="22">250 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 Avetisyan, &amp; Zardaryan, 2004). However, it was by no means the first such program. In terest in the South Caucasus during the era of detente often arose from problems in the archaeology of southwest Asia. Marilyn Kelly-Buccelati's (1974) dissertation on the Early Transcaucasian Culture (Kura-Araxes) and Karen Rubinson's (1976) examination of Middle Bronze Age materials from Trialeti were two of the earliest American engagements with materials from the Caucasus. Both dissertations emerged out of research agendas shaped by an interest in the archaeology of the northern highlands of the Near East. Sustained international collaborative field investigations in the South Caucasus only began in earnest during the era of perestroika. One of the first, and most ambitious, of these programs was the International Program for Anthropological Research in the Caucasus (IPARC). Founded by Philip Kohl, Ruben Badalyan, and the late Zaal Kikodze in the late 1980s, IPARC strove to conduct collaborative investigations across the North and South Caucasus with excavations at Horom, Satkhe (southern Georgia), and Velikent (Daghestan, Russia; Gadzhiev, Kohl, Magomedov, &amp; Stronach, 1995; Gadzhiev, Kohl, Magomedov, &amp; Stronach, 1997) and informal surveys in northern Azerbaijan. Kohl came to the Caucasus, after working in Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia, with an abiding interest in examining macro-scale flows of goods across historically shifting exchange networks. The investigations of IPARC thus mark the arrival of an original research model in the Caucasus centered on detailing a unified prehistory of the isthmus forged through truly international collaborative field investigations. Kohl's pioneering move to the Caucasus opened the door for a host of new international research programs, including Project ArAGATS. Subsequent collaborations in Armenia alone have included scholars from the United States, Italy, Germany, France, Russia, and Austria. These programs have conducted both regional surveys and excavations, investigating problems from the Paleolithic peopling of the region to the coalescence of empires. In addition, these collaborative programs have brought with them new methodologies, new opportunities for the application of analytical technologies to archaeological materials, and new dialogs regarding the interpretive agenda of archaeology in Armenia (Lindsay and Smith, in press). Current directions in the archaeology of the South Caucasus The complex intellectual history of archaeological research in the South Caucasus provides the basic framework for contemporary investigations, both in terms of the guiding theoretical issues and the basic parameters of chronology and periodization. Yet the region now stands at a moment of considerable intellectual flux. Recent efforts to revise Martirosyan's long standing periodization have produced important new debates over the key diagnostic features and absolute temporal boundaries of the Bronze and Iron Ages. And the recent growth of work in eastern Turkey on sites clearly part of a broader Armenian Highland archaeological ecumene has produced new struggles over chronology and nomenclature, (not to mention ge ography where terms like "Armenian Highlands" are assumed?usually wrongly?to cloak territorial claims). Furthermore, the advent of new collaborative research programs, methods of data collection, and techniques of analysis have substantially altered the anthropological and historical problems orienting archaeological inquiry. Current directions in the archae ology of the South Caucasus are thus the product of the complex intellectual genealogy described above. My purpose in the remainder of this discussion is to provide an overview of current problems in the archaeology of the southern Caucasia from the Neolithic through the Urartian ^ Springer</page><page sequence="23">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 251 kingdom. My purpose is not to provide a detailed periodization?this is in preparation for inclusion in a monograph on the regional investigations of Project ArAGATS (Smith &amp; Badalyan, n.d.). And yet such issues must be discussed since they are the basis for much of the current debate. Nor is my purpose to provide outlines for each major era (see Burney &amp; Lang, 1972; Chataigner, 1995; Gogadze, 1982; Kushnareva, 1997; Martirosyan, 1964; Ozfirat, 2001; Piotrovskii, 1949, 1959; Pitskhelauri, 1979). Instead, my goal is to focus squarely on the current points of contention and to highlight limitations and openings within contemporary debates. The agenda which unifies this discussion is a concern to move the archaeology of the South Caucasus away from its primary focus upon the formation of homogeneous culture groups and their lines of "interaction" with neighbors and towards investigations of the social orders that constituted life in the region. My purpose is not to suggest that there is only one proper agenda for regional archaeology, a locale where the visions of the art historian, the prehistorian, and the anthropological archaeologist have long rubbed convivial shoulders. But rather I strive here to point out how a lack of understanding of the social worlds that emerged in the region forestalls advancement in the other domains of inquiry. Prolegomena: Neolithic antecedents The Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods (Fig. 3) have recently emerged as revitalized domains of archaeological research (Chataigner, 1995). Kuftin (1943) originally assigned the Kura Araxes horizon to the Eneolithic (Chalcolithic), arguing that it represented the earliest agricultural communities in the Caucasus. Subsequent revision of the region's periodization reassigned the Kura-Araxes to the Early Bronze Age (see particularly Martirosyan, 1964), thus opening a new space for investigation into its progenitors. Both E. Krupnov and R. Munchaev were convinced of the salience of this new Neolithic phase to the prehistory of the region from Eastern Europe to Central Asia, leading Krupnov (1964, p. 41) to remark rather cryptically: "The Caucasian Neolithic is our Carthage." What defines the Neolithic within the Soviet and post-Soviet tradition tends to begin and end with food production?early farming and stock rearing (Masson, 1971, p. 160; Mongait, 1961, p. 197)?while the Chalcolithic (or Eneolithic, a term more generally used across Eurasia) is defined most notably by initial experiments with unalloyed metal (Kushnareva, 1997, p. 41; Munchaev, 1982). Overall, there are relatively few radiocarbon dates extant from Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites, forcing absolute dating to rest largely upon Near Eastern parallels, stratigraphy, and convention. The transition from the Mesolithic to the aceramic Neolithic is traditionally dated to the late seventh millennium B.C. while radiocarbon determinations from ceramic Neolithic sites of the Shulaveri-Shomu horizon suggest this later Neolithic phase began some time in the early sixth millennium B.C. (Kavtaradze, 1983; Kiguradze &amp; Menabde, 2004). Recent radio carbon results from the site of Aratashen in the Ararat plain situate the site's early ceramic Neolithic occupation level (II) firmly within the second quarter of the sixth millennium (Badalyan, Avetisyan, Lombard, &amp; Chataigner, 2005, p. 38). The Neolithic/Chalcolithic chronological boundary is largely unclear, creating for some, such as Masson (1982, p. 8), an agenda for future research and for others, such as Akhundov (2004, p. 432), a reason to dismiss the Chalcolithic as a discrete phase altogether. Yet a recent analysis by Kiguradze and Sagona (2003) argues for an early Chalcolithic phase extending from roughly 4800 to 4000 B.C. (marked primarily by complexes from sites in northern Caucasia such as Sioni and Kviriatskhali) followed by a Middle/Late Chalcolithic dating to 4000-3200/3000 B.C. (including sites such as Tsopi, Tekhut, Berikldeebi, and Sos HoyUk VA). Overall, this schema Q Springer</page><page sequence="24">252 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 Fig. 3 Map of Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites discussed in the text accords well with the limited data available at present, although the late date for the transition to the Early Bronze Age and the Kura-Araxes horizon is a matter of considerable debate, as will be discussed below. Sites of the aceramic Neolithic period are particularly well-documented in western Cau casia, including Abkhazia and Adjaria. An early survey in western Georgia conducted by G. Grigolia in the 1960s recorded 20 sites; however, substantial occupation layers have been documented in only a few sites, such as Khorshi and Chkhortoli, and preservation is quite limited (Kiguradze &amp; Menabde, 2004, p. 350). A notable exception is the Darkveti rock shel ter, on the upper Qvirila River, which revealed an aceramic Neolithic layer overlying a late Mesolithic occupation that in turn lay underneath a Chalcolithic level (Nebieridze, 1978). Preservation at Darkveti is better than at most sites in western Caucasia, providing a suite of faunal material that included both wild and domesticated animals. Darkveti, augmented by data from the Nagutuni-type sites in Shida Kartli (Grigiola, 1977), has shed considerable light on the material repertoires of the aceramic Neolithic in western Caucasia, including a bone and antler industry that produced items such as awls, punches, and needles and a lithic ^ Springer</page><page sequence="25">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 253 industry centered on microlith and blade production utilizing flint and obsidian (Kushnareva, 1997, p. 18). Sites from the highland middle Kura drainage of northern Caucasia and from the lowland steppes of eastern Caucasia provide critical reference points for the ceramic Neolithic and Chalcolithic, including the Shulaveri-Shomu horizon style of the late sixth-fifth millennia B.C. and the later "Sioni" complex of the early fourth millennium B.C. Investigations on the Kvemo-Kartli plains in eastern Georgia explored several mound sites that provided stratified ceramic Neolithic occupation layers, including Shomu Tepe, Shulaveris Gora, and Imiris Gora (Kiguradze, 1976). The Shulaveri-Shomu horizon is marked most notably by curvilinear domestic architecture which, in its later phases encompasses small courtyards delineated by similarly curvilinear walls. In eastern Caucasia, Alikmek Tepesi, near Baku, has proven particularly sensational, thanks in large measure to the painted designs found on the interior walls of one of the houses as well as the non-residential structures described as storage rooms (Narimanov, 1987, 1992). The architecture at the site follows the overall template of Shulaveri-Shomu horizon construction, but also departs from it in ways whose significance has yet to be clearly understood. Comparatively little is known about the Neolithic and Chalcolithic of southern Caucasia. The Neolithic proper is largely unknown, limited to levels from a small sounding at the site of Khatunarkh (Torosyan, Mikaelian, &amp; Davedzhian, 1970) whose temporal attribution hinges largely on the paucity of ceramic remains rather than a positive identification of well-described assemblages. For over two decades, the site of Tekhut in the Ararat Plain, excavated by Torosyan (1976) beginning in the late 1960s, has provided the primary, if not exclusive, point of reference for the Chalcolithic period in Armenia. Tekhut's well preserved curvilinear domestic architecture and extensive lithic and ceramic assemblages (with strong similarities to the Shulaveri-Shomu complexes) has had few local parallels with which to constitute a more general picture of the unique features of the southern Caucasian Neolithic. Recent excavations at the site of Aratashen have helped to reinvigorate the study of the Neolithic period in Armenia. Located on the Kasakh river, 1.5 km southwest of Vagharshapat, Aratashen was briefly explored in the 1970s by Sardaryan and in the late 1980s by Aslanyan. But it was only with the excavations from 1999 to 2004 led by Pierre Lombard and Ruben Badalyan (and since continued by Badalyan) that the significance of the site has been more clearly unveiled (Badalyan, Chataigner, &amp; Kohl, 2004; Badalyan, Lombard, Chataigner, &amp; Avetisyan, 2004,2005). The occupation levels at Aratashen straddle the aceramic (level III) and ceramic (levels I?II) Neolithic, situating it as a potentially critical bridge between the traditions know from Darkveti and those documented among the Shulaveri-Shomu sites. Yet despite its geographic proximity to these sites, the pise technique of Aratashen's ear liest architecture contrasts markedly with the plano-convex mudbrick constructions of the Shulaveri-Shomu horizon (phases I-V). As the excavators note, the use of pise ties Aratashen more directly to the building traditions at sites to the south, such as Nakhichevan Kiil Tepe, the lower levels at Hajji Firuz, and Tilki Tepe than to the Shulaveri-Shomu sites (Badalyan, Chataigner, &amp; Kohl, 2004; Badalyan, Lombard, Chataigner, &amp; Avetisyan, 2004, p. 400). Such architectural heterogeneity raises the quite intriguing question of potential fault lines within the interaction spheres of the pre-Early Bronze Age Caucasus. Even in level II at Aratashen, where pise yields to mudbrick construction, the shape of the bricks more closely follows that used at sites to the east (such as Alikemek Tepesi) and the south (such as the upper levels at Hajji Firuz). Furthermore, the excavations at Aratashen did not uncover any of the antler hoes so typical of the Shulaveri-Shomu assemblages, reinforcing a sense ^ Springer</page><page sequence="26">254 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 of discontinuity between the Kura and Araxes drainages. But even as some elements of the archaeological record from Aratashen point to lines of distinction between northern and southern Caucasia during the Neolithic, other elements of the artifact repertoire indicate the broad dissemination of a handful of conspicuous objects, such as bone spoons and "palettes," the blade-based lithic industry, and the limited ceramic repertoire (levels I and II). The Chalcolithic of the South Caucasus is distinguished primarily by a dispersal of settlement?perhaps indicative of increased transhumance?and a new suite of ceramics which include, most notably, jars with decorated rims emblematic of what Kiguradze and Sagona (2003) describe as the "Sioni complex" based on the type site, 60 km southwest of Tbilisi. But overall, the Early Chalcolithic sites appear to be largely continuous with Neolithic traditions. With the Middle and Late Chalcolithic periods, aspects of village landscapes suggest that communities were altering their approaches to the production of internal social groups?such as the large "monumental" building at Berikldeebi (V2)?as well as relations to their neighbors?for example, the boundary wall at Sos Hoyiik (VA) (Sagona, Sagona, Newton, Pemberton, &amp; McPhee, 2004; Sagona &amp; Sagona, 2000). There is considerable desire to visualize these changes in the Late Chalcolithic as leading inexorably to the ultimate flourishing of the Kura-Araxes. At root is a theoretical aspiration to understand the Kura-Araxes by apprehending its primordial roots. An enigmatic "proto Kura-Araxes" (Kiguradze &amp; Sagona, 2003, p. 91) thus provides a glimpse?a prequel?of the Early Bronze world to come. There is considerable disagreement on whether current data provide evidence of a transitional suite of artifacts that link the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age horizons (cf. Smith &amp; Badalyan, n.d.; Kiguradze &amp; Sagona, 2003; Palumbi, 2003a). But perhaps more seriously, with the exception of potentially revolutionary new findings from Sos Hoyiik, there is little in the Chalcolithic archaeological record as a whole at present that clearly prefigures the radical socio-cultural transformations that accompanied the explosive growth of the Kura-Araxes horizon. It is important to note that alongside local Chalcolithic traditions, several assemblages from the South Caucasus have also presented collections of Halaf (e.g., Nakhichevan Kul Tepe and Leila Depe [Narimanov, 1987]), Ubaid (e.g. Godedzor, near the village of Angeghakot in southern Armenia [Avetisyan, pers. comm.]), and Lake Urmia painted wares (again, Godedzor [Palumbi pers. comm., 2006]). While these finds are generally quite isolated and limited, some, such as the recent findings from Godedzor, present such robust and diverse assemblages as to preclude framing them solely in relation to rare and exotic trade items. And yet it is critical that we understand the Chalcolithic world in its own terms in order that we might grasp how and why its traditions were so quickly displaced. What within these communities made them so fragile as to be swept aside so rapidly by new socio-material practices of the Early Bronze Age? It is difficult as yet to define an agenda for investigations of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic in the South Caucasus. At present, a great deal of research is of necessity centered on basic time-space systematics. Sites like Aratashen will clearly have much to contribute if we are to develop a clearer sense of dynamism and change within the pre-Kura-Araxes world of the South Caucasus and the geographies shaping local spheres of interaction. But we will also need to ultimately rid ourselves of the teleological view of the Chalcolithic which sees it primarily as a way to get to the Early Bronze Age. That is, the Kura Araxes is not a necessary consequence of Neolithic and Chalcolithic ways of life. We face the challenge in studies of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic South Caucasus of coming to terms with the era in its own right as host to remarkably heterogeneous ways of life founded within varying patterns of inter-regional interaction. But it is of course quite difficult to get away from the pressing question as to what happened sometime in the late fourth millennium B.C., somewhere in the Armenian Highlands, to forge a new understanding of village community Q Springer</page><page sequence="27">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 255 Fig. 4 Map of Early Bronze Age sites discussed in the text that would rapidly come to create the most geographically extensive horizon style in the prehistoric Near East. Community and dispersion: The Early Bronze Age Under the auspices of the Kura-Araxes material culture horizon (Fig. 4), the South Caucasus became closely tied into an Early Bronze Age regional ecumene which, at its height, extended from the Northeast Caucasus to the Taurus and Zagros mountains. Termed the Kura-Araxes culture by Kuftin (1940), the same archaeological repertoire has also been dubbed "the Shengavit culture" (Baiburtyan, 1938), the Early Transcaucasian Culture (Burney &amp; Lang, 1972), the Outer Fertile Crescent Culture (Kelly-Buccellati, 1980), and the Culture of Northeast Anatolia (Lamb, 1954). In addition, more far-flung manifestations of related archaeological materials in the Amuq (phase H) and the Levant have been referred to as the Red-Black Burnished Ware culture (Braidwood &amp; Braidwood, 1960) and the Khirbet-Kerak culture (Amiran, 1965). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="28">256 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 The basic archaeological parameters of the Kura-Araxes horizon style have been suc cinctly outlined by Kiguradze and Sagona (2003, p. 38) in terms of a series of inter-related traits found simultaneously in architecture, ceramics (Fig. 5), and bone and lithic industries: These traits include: rectilinear, subrectangular and circular houses built of mud brick or wattle and daub; portable and fixed hearths that are often anthropomorphic or zoomor phic in style; a wide range of hand built burnished pottery often displaying a contrasting color scheme of black, gray, brown and red, and sometimes bearing elaborate ornamen tation; well-crafted bone implements; standardized horned animal figurines; a simple range of metal objects most of which may be classed as arsenical bronzes; and a standardized stone tool repertoire that is manufactured primarily from obsidian in the eastern areas. While red-black burnished wares are its most distinctive and ubiquitous markers, the Kura-Araxes horizon also includes several related suites of ceramics, including black wares Fig. 5 Kura-Araxes (Karnut-Shengavit group) ceramics from the site of Gegharot (after Smith et al.. 2004) ^ Springer</page><page sequence="29">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 257 and monochrome wares (Palumbi, 2003a). It is important to note that a remarkable array of material media?metal, ceramic, lithics, architecture, etc.?are all packed into the term "Kura-Araxes" raising the very real problem of defining heterogeneity?in technical prac tices, in social orders, in political regimes, in cultural identities?within what quite easily becomes a vast, monolithic, homogenous culture area. Largely thanks to this tightly defined homogeneity, two issues have dominated research and debate on the archaeology of the Early Bronze Age: from whence did the Kura-Araxes horizon originate and how did it come to be so widely distributed? Both questions make sense only in so far as the Kura-Araxes is ceded a disturbingly high degree of singularity, reified as a thing rather than examined as a heterogeous array of social orders, cultural traditions, and material practices. The periodization and chronology of Kura-Araxes sites has long been a matter of contention. While Kuftin had assigned the Kura-Araxes horizon to the Eneolithic (see above), during the 1960s, several scholars (e.g., lessen, 1963; Kushnareva &amp; Chubinishvili, 1963; Abibullaev, 1963) successfully argued for its realignment with the Early Bronze Age based primarily on evidence from the stratigraphy at the site of Nakhichevan Kiiltepe, spectral analyses of extant metals (e.g., Chernykh, 1965, pp. 106-110; Gadzhiev, 1991, p. 31), and a desire to conform to chronological terminology in use in Anatolia and Iran (e.g., Burton-Brown, 1951; cf. Bumey, 1958). Recently, Kiguradze and Sagona (2003) have argued for returning the initial Kura-Araxes to the Late Chalcolithic period. In this discussion, I follow the schema that currently predominates in southern Caucasia outlined by Avetisyan, Badaljan, Hmayakian, and Piliposian (1996) and set forth in a monograph currently in preparation on the regional research of Project ArAGATS (Smith &amp; Badalyan, n.d.). The chronology for the initial appearance of Kura-Araxes ceramics (KA I, ca. 3500-2900 B.C.) is a matter of some debate at present. Traditional chronologies set the emergence of the Kura-Araxes at the opening of the third millennium B.C. (Kushnareva &amp; Chubinishvili, 1970; Martirosyan, 1964). But an iconoclastic "high" chronology offered by Kavtaradze (1983) in the early 1980s and a series of new radiocarbon determinations have conspired to push the dawn of the Kura-Araxes phenomenon?or, more precisely, the initial production of recognizable Kura-Araxes ceramics?well into the late fourth millennium B.C. In southern Caucasia, calibrated radiocarbon dates from Early Bronze Age tombs at Horom and Talin (tomb 10) as well as the settlement at Aparan III all point to the existence of a full-fledged production regime for red-black burnished wares by ca 3350 B.C. (Palumbi, 2003a). Slightly earlier dates from level VA at the remarkable site of Sos Hoyiik in northeast em Anatolia have led Anthony Sagona to suggest that the associated repertoire of ceramics, including but not limited to red-black burnished wares, arose in the region several centuries earlier than in southern Caucasia (Kiguradze &amp; Sagona, 2003; Sagona et ai, 2004). Sagona's argument is a remarkably sophisticated one that examines a broad suite of ceramic assem blages from the Late Chalcolithic "Sioni" wares to fully developed Kura-Araxes repertoires to posit a developmental sequence wherein the production technique producing burnished surfaces originates in eastern Anatolia before diffusing eastward along the Araxes into the South Caucasus. A recent study by Giulio Palumbi (2003a) has further added support to Sagona's argument, emphasizing the later appearance of red-black burnished wares in the South Caucasus. However, this reconstruction has not been universally embraced. There are at least three limitations to the argument. First, we must be forthright that in trying to detail the earliest appearance of the Kura-Araxes we are dealing with a dangerously small data set. While the level VA exposures at Sos are sizable, in southern Caucasia we are dealing with a data set collected from two small tombs and a single 1.5 x 1.5 m trench at Aparan III. It would seem premature to found an entire theory of origins on this basis. Second, the evidence from the initial Kura-Araxes sites in southern Caucasia do suggest Q Springer</page><page sequence="30">258 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 that a fully realized set of diagnostic burnished wares were already in production in the region by ca. 3350 B.C., leaving open the very real possibility of a prior phase of emergence contemporary with Sos?perhaps in conversation with communities of potters all along the Araxes. It is important to keep in mind that because the number of sites bearing on this question is so small, a single new trench can force revision of the entire edifice. Lastly, there is reason to suspect that the debate over Kura-Araxes origins may be con ceptually misplaced. Arguments for mutually exclusive points of origin tend to envision the Kura-Araxes as a monolithic package, assembled perhaps from different elements, but ultimately attaining a material orthodoxy. Palumbi (2003a, p. 104) is quite right when he suggests instead a model of intense interaction that extends all along the highland Araks and Kura river basins during the second half of the fourth millennium B.C. What does it mean to suggest that the Kura-Araxes originated in eastern Anatolia rather than Transcaucasia? What is at stake in the question? At the moment, it turns out that quite little is at stake because we do not have a clear understanding of what the Kura-Araxes actually is. If the Kura-Araxes is primarily a technique of ceramic production?for example, an approach to burnishing pottery?then extensive debates over origins seem unlikely to present an opportunity for an archaeological resolution. If the Kura-Araxes is more than a technique of production?say, a people, an ethnicity, or a culture?as is implicit in much of the literature, then we enter far more problematic terrain. In a geographic sense, an emphasis on pots as people (contra warnings of Kramer, 1977) forces us to envision the social world of the Kura-Araxes as a largely undifferentiated, homo geneous social space. The communities of the Early Bronze Age, from Dagestan to the upper Euphrates are reduced to a regrettable sameness sociologically simply because their pottery looks very similar. Furthermore, in a temporal sense, the debate over Kura-Araxes origins as the genesis of a culture forces us to see early experiments in burnishing pots as initial expres sions of an enduring essence that reaches its logical apogee in the full fluorescence of the Kura-Araxes horizon. Aside from its archaeological teleology, this limits our understanding of historical process to the mechanisms of migration and diffusion/assimilation. This brings us to the second primary focus of contemporary work on the Early Bronze Age of the South Caucasus?the expansion of the Kura-Araxes horizon during the KA II (ca. 2900-2600 B.C.) and KA III (ca. 2600-2400 B.C.) phases (but see Smith and Badalyan [n.d.] for a revision of this chronology based on new results from Gegharot). The most oft-cited cause of these migratory waves is population pressures in the heartland triggered by climate change or overgrazing (Burney, 1996; Sagona, 1984, pp. 138-139). In his study of Eurasian metallurgy, Evgeni Chernykh (1992, pp. 54-55) suggests that control over ore sources and the specialized technology of extraction and smelting may have promoted radial trade networks that linked Caucasia to it neighbors, extending as far north as the Dneiper and Volga rivers, and south into Anatolia, central Iran and the Levant. Mitchell Rothman (2003), in contrast, has suggested that Kura-Araxes expansion arises in a series of more quotidian movements and transformations. ... the appearance of Transcaucasian ware in Eastern Turkey and, for that matter, in Western Iran represents a series of ripples in a stream of movement of pastoral nomads, traders, and small farmers back and forth in this larger region. These small segments of the Transcaucasian population, after wandering into Eastern Turkey and Western Iran, mixed with pre-Bronze Age populations to create the great variability observed in artifacts of the Early Transcaucasian Culture over this large area (Rothman, 2003, p. 95). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="31">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 259 The primary factor in the expansion of the Kura-Araxes, according to Rothman is, at least initially, access to new markets in eastern Anatolia and, ultimately, at northern Syrian sites such as Tell Brak or Hamoukar. Kavtaradze (2004, p. 543) advances a more piratical version of this theory, suggesting that the prosperity of Uruk enclaves in Anatolia and Northern Syria drew Kura-Araxes communities out of the highlands not as traders but as raiders and conquerors. However, the evidence implicating Kura-Araxes communities in the destruction of Uruk enclaves in southern Anatolia and northern Syria is not, at present, compelling. Rothman's reconstruction admirably emphasizes the importance of accounting for both the dynamic geographic expansion of the Kura-Araxes horizon style and the sources of variability within it. However, there is little at present to support the idea of a market driven expansion. Some "Transcaucasian" style metals are indeed found in northern Syria, most notably at Tell Mozan (Kelly-Buccellati, 1990). But remarkably there is very little evidence of Kura-Araxes materials in the large sites of northern Syria. Only a handful of Kura-Araxes sherds are known from Tell Brak (Oates, Oates, &amp; McDonald, 2001, p. 160; the numbers involved are extraordinarily low?19 sherds found over almost a decade of excavation [Emberling, pers. comm.]). No Kura-Araxes materials have been reported from excavations at Hamoukar (Gibson, pers. comm.). Furthermore, as Kohl (1992, p. 124) has noted, there is very little to suggest the movement of "materials or peoples" in the other direction, from northern Mesopotamia into the Armenian Highland and the South Caucasus. Indeed, what is most interesting about the relation between northern Syria and the world of the Kura-Araxes to the north is just how little contact there seems to be across what appears to have been a tightly regulated social boundary (cf. Kavtaradze, 2004). And yet the expansion of the Kura-Araxes horizon in itself reveals the remarkable dynamism of the highland Early Bronze Age in terms of population movement, shifting world views, and stylistic creativity. There are considerable disagreements at present regarding the nature of mobility within Kura-Araxes communities. A number of scholars, including Rothman (2003) and Palumbi (2003b) have argued for increasingly mobile ways of life during the Early Bronze Age. Unfortunately, strong evidence of Kura-Araxes nomadism is quite hard to come by and the archaeological record of the Early Bronze Age in southern Caucasia is dominated by sizable, stable villages that appear to have hosted communities invested in both agricultural and pastoral production. Kushnareva (1997) frames mobility within the Early Bronze Age in terms of both sustained patterns of transhumance within Kura-Araxes villages and the slow migrations of communities during the third millennium B.C. along vertical routes linking flatlands to mountain slopes. In asserting transhumance within Kura-Araxes communities, Kushnareva (1997, p. 192) cites a disproportionate percentage of sheep/goat bones in higher elevation sites as evidence of a decreased reliance on cattle driven by the need for herds to travel increasingly long-distances. However, recent studies by Project ArAGATS on the Early Bronze Age levels at Gegharot (2100 m a.s.l.) found roughly equal proportions of large (12.47%) and medium (18.69%) mammal bones, suggesting that higher elevation sites did not abandon cattle rearing (Monahan, 2005). Kushnareva's (1997, p. 188) suggestion that the third millennium witnessed an overall migration of communities from flatlands to mountain slopes also appears to lack support. She cites three factors driving this movement: increasing population, exhaustion of "old soils," and aridization of the countryside. Unfortunately, there is no archaeological evidence to confirm any of these three forces, with the possible exception of population increase. Furthermore, new radiocarbon dates from Gegharot indicate that by the beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C., even high elevation sites were already occupied by sizable permanent villages. Thus, we still remain largely uncertain as to the degree of mobility within Kura-Araxes communities and as a result lack a well-developed mechanism for positing the forces behind the spread of the Kura-Araxes phenomenon. i Springer</page><page sequence="32">260 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 To date, we know frustratingly little about the social world of Kura-Araxes village commu nities. Aspects of local and long distance exchange have recently come to be better understood thanks to detailed examinations of local obsidian sources and exchange networks (Badalyan, 2002; Badalyan, Chataigner, &amp; Kohl, 2004; Badalyan, Lombard, Chataigner, &amp; Avetisyan, 2004; Blackman, Badalyan, Kikodze, &amp; Kohl, 1998); elements of Early Bronze Age sub sistence economies received some attention during the 1970s with limited examinations of irrigation and studies of agricultural tools (Kushnareva &amp; Lisitsyna, 1979; Khachatrian, 1975); and several studies have utilized burial data to sketch the outlines of Kura-Araxes social divisions (e.g., Mindiashvili, 1983), suggesting considerable heterogeneity within communities. And yet despite these notable advances, we still remain uncertain about what the Kura-Araxes material repertoire, as an archaeological phenomenon, represents in an thropological or sociological terms. The rapid expansion of the Kura-Araxes horizon during the third millennium B.C. suggests demographically and ideologically vibrant communities possessed of a uniquely expansive world view. However, the stability of the basic Kura Araxes ceramic repertoire, consistently marked by the ubiquitous black-brown burnished ware, suggests a profoundly conservative sense of materiality. These two senses of the Early Bronze Age villages of southern Caucasia can only be resolved by closer attention to local communities, their social life, their economic priorities, and cultural values. What remains to be developed in the archaeology of Early Bronze Age southern Caucasia is an integrated account of social life within these village communities and the internal and external forces that drove processes of geographic expansion. Mobility and martialism: The middle Bronze Age Even as scholars contend with the difficult issues surrounding the timing of the emergence of the Kura-Araxes, new data are raising questions about its end as well. The end of the Early and beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, across most of the South Caucasus, was marked by the disappearance of the Kura-Araxes archaeological horizon and the large-scale abandonment of settled village communities. Traditional chronologies date the end of the Kura-Araxes to approximately 2100 B.C., but have long been hamstrung by both the lack of absolute dates and the imprecise nature of early Middle Bronze Age ceramic sequences (Sagona, 1984). The transformations in social life, economy, and material culture accompanying the collapse of the Kura-Araxes has generated considerable debate over whether the Middle Bronze Age represents a moment of rupture or continuity within the prehistory of the South Caucasus. Late Early Bronze Age assemblages, such as those from Amiranis Gora III, Ilto, and Tsikhagora (Fig. 6), indicate that distinct material traditions were developing in the length ening shadow of the Kura-Araxes (Avetisyan, 2003). These new traditions were associated with an emerging way of life, centered not in mixed agro-pastoral villages but in markedly transhumant pastoralist communities. This initial, or "Early Kurgans," phase of the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2300-2100 B.C.) is most clearly defined by the appearance of kurgan style burials?pit and stone cist tombs covered by mounds of earth and/or stone cobbles. In stratigraphic terms, except for the late third millennium B.C. layers from the Bedeni sites in southern Georgia, there is little clear evidence for continuity in the South Caucasus between Early and Middle Bronze Age occupations. However, elements of the ceramic repertoire do suggest connections between Early Kurgans and Kura-Araxes material traditions. What this means in social terms, however, is as yet unclear since what is most striking about the tombs and kurgans of Shengavit (IV), Trialeti (old group), and Martkopi are the indications they provide of significant transformations under way during the third quarter of the third millennium B.C. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="33">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 261 o?i *&gt;xnr* ?we Fig. 6 Map of Middle Bronze Age sites discussed in the text The dramatic shift in settlement patterns across Caucasia during the Early to Middle Bronze transition is traditionally interpreted as evidence of the advent of increasingly no madic social groups predicated upon pastoral subsistence production. Within most current chronologies in the South Caucasus, the transitional Early Kurgans phase of the Middle Bronze Age is followed by the Trialeti or Trialeti-Vanadzor phase (ca. 2100-1700 B.C.). It is during this period that a range of materials emphasize the prominence of pastoral production and equestrian mobility within these communities. The Trialeti phase is typically charac terized by a suite of archaeological markers defined by assemblages from a series of large kurgans at sites such as Tsnori (Dedabrishvili, 1979), Meskheti (Dzhaparidze, Avalishvili, &amp; Tsereteli, 1985), and of course Trialeti itself (Kuftin, 1941; Dzhaparidze, Kikividze, &amp; Avalishvili, 1971). As an example of one of the most impressive burials of the era, the largest kurgan at Tsnori was 140m in diameter and 11m high. The earthen mound was covered with a "breastplate," or thin layer of stone cobbles. A burial chamber was found on the eastern segment of the tomb containing a wooden couch supported by wooden posts. Four human skeletons were in the burial, one bearing golden ornaments suggesting the body of the principal deceased. The chamber also contained parts of a wooden wagon, ceramic vessels, gold beads, bone and obsidian arrowheads, and a single bronze dagger. Q Springer</page><page sequence="34">262 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 The appearance of carts and wagons, as well as ox and horse sacrifices, in burials from sites such as Trialeti (group II; Dzhaparidze, 1969; Gogadze, 1972), Lori-Berd (Devedzhian, 1981), Aruch (Areshian, Kafadarian, Simonian, Tiratsian, &amp; Kalantarian, 1977), and Kirgi (Esaian, 1976, p. 101) attest to not only the technology of mobility during the Middle Bronze Age, but also its centrality to dimensions of belief and value. Similarly, the inclusion of large numbers of bronze spearheads, axes, swords, daggers, and arrowheads (also of obsidian) point to the considerable violence of the era. The iconography of a silver-plated goblet from the kurgan at Karashamb, most notably, indicates quite clearly that this violence was politically ordered, undertaken under the auspices of elite competition, and framed by a piratical political-economy predicated on conquest, raiding, and death (Oganesian, 1992; Smith, 2001). Both the emergence of mobile pastoralism and of a political-economy of violence appear to have been closely tied to the emergence of radical inequality between a martial elite and the remainder of the social body. The monumental construction and rich mortuary goods of tombs from Trialeti, Vanadzor, and Lori Berd, as well as the iconography of elite privilege from Karashamb, testify to significant changes in the social orders of Caucasia and provide the initial indications of emergent sociopolitical inequality in the region. During the Middle Bronze III phase (ca. 1700-1550 B.C.), the South Caucasus appears to have fragmented into several distinct material culture horizons. If the earlier Trialeti Vanadzor sites present a relatively homogeneous horizon style for the Middle Bronze II phase, transformations in burial construction and the forms and styles of painted and black ornamented pottery during the succeeding period indicate the differentiation of the region into at least three contemporary, overlapping ceramic horizons: Karmir-Berd, Karmir-Vank, and Sevan-Uzerlik. Both Karmir-Berd and Karmir-Vank are principally defined by painted pottery styles. Although Trialeti-Vanadzor phase pottery also includes vessels with painted hanging triangles, web hatching and zoomorphic figures (most often, birds), these tend to appear on only a small portion of the corpus. Karmir-Berd materials largely prevail in the highlands of central southern and northern Caucasia, most iconically represented in the materials from the site of Verin Naver (Fig. 7a, Simonyan, 1979, 1982, 1984). The diagnostic ceramic repertoire includes a broad range of vessel forms decorated with painted geometric motifs, including checkerboard and web hatched squares and "bow-tie" or "double poleaxe" opposed triangles. The Karmir-Vank horizon is best known from the Nakhichevan region of Azerbaijan, including Kizil-Vank and Kiiltepe I (Abibullaev, 1982), and the site of Haftavan Tepe in northwestern Iran (Burney, 1975). While Karmir-Berd materials are known almost entirely from mortuary contexts, Karmir-Vank materials have been recovered from both burials and settlements. The ornamentation of the pottery includes geometric, zoomorphic, and anthropomorphic elements rendered in black, red, and brown polychrome compositions. Hanging triangles, bird figures, and web-hatch motifs do suggest a repertoire of signs similar to that employed in Trialeti-Vanadzor and Karmir-Berd decoration. However, the compositional distinction of the Karmir-Vank ceramics suggests a move toward representations of narrative or scenes. The Sevan-Uzerlik horizon tends to predominate in the western steppe of Azerbaijan, the Nagorno-Karabakh highlands, and the Sevan and Syunik regions of Armenia. The type site of Uzerlik Tepe hosted long term systematic explorations during the 1950s and 1960s (Kushnareva, 1997, pp. 129-144) and remains today the most thoroughly investigated Sevan-Uzerlik assemblage. In contrast to the painted decorative styles of the Karmir-Berd and Kizil-Vank horizons, Sevan-Uzerlik ceramics are black polished vessels with incised and punctate decoration (Fig. 7b). These often include punctate hanging necklace or rounded t?

It is important to note that the general regional divisions of the three Middle Bronze III ceramic horizon styles cannot be taken as defining a rigid geographic mosaic. Sevan basin sites have also yielded evidence of Karmir-Vank and Karmir-Berd painted pottery; Ararat plain sites (such as Verin Naver, Fig. 7) have included both Karmir-Berd and Sevan Uzerlik materials and Sevan sites contain both Karmir-Berd and Sevan-Uzerlik ceramics. In Georgia, Trialeti-Vanadzor materials persist into the Middle Bronze III phase at sites such as Treli, Tsavgli, Natakhtari, and Pevrebi; however, it is also possible to detect the influence of Sevan-Uzerlik complexes as well, represented by black pottery with dotted lines. During the Middle Bronze III phase, the wealth of the burial inventories seen in the preceding phase begins to diminish such that, in the complexes represented by Karmir-Berd or Karmir-Berd/Sevan Uzerlik pottery, relatively few bronze artifacts have been recorded. Furthermore, in the complexes that signify the end of Middle Bronze Age, the distinctive painted pottery becomes increasingly rare, yielding to the incised gray and black ware ceramics that came to predominate under the Lchashen-Metsamor horizon of the Late Bronze Age. At sites such as Gegharot on the Tsaghkahovit Plain of central Armenia, the transitional ^ Springer</page><page sequence="36">264 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 repertoire of materials marking the shift to the Late Bronze Age appear to be most directly tied to the Sevan-Uzerlik horizon. And yet we remain unclear at present as to exactly what the typological distinctions in ceramics that define the end of the Middle Bronze Age represent in terms of time, space, or social difference. The transformations that altered the social landscape of the South Caucasus during the late third and early second millennia B.C. reverberated more broadly across the Armenian Highland. Similar transitions have been documented in eastern Anatolia (f ihngiroglu, 1984; Ozfirat, 2001) and in northwestern Iran (Hamlin, 1974; Rubinson, 1977, 1991, 2004), rein forcing a sense of the syncopated rhythms of wide-scale social transformations in the region. Even as the Kura-Araxes horizon gave way to a patchwork mosaic of more heterogeneous local material traditions, the pace and particulars of regional prehistory appear to be widely shared across the region. Discussions of cultural interconnections during the early second millennium B.C. often push the region further into the neighboring worlds of Mesopotamia (Dzhaparidze, 1988) or Anatolia (Rubinson, 2003). Yet, what remains remarkable about the region from the Early to the Middle Bronze Age is how little appears to leak out of the Armenian Highlands into adjacent regions. The material connections linking the world of Trialeti, for example, to its neighbors beyond the Armenian Highlands are not highly robust even though they can be quite convincing. For example, Rubinson (2003, p. 141) has recently described the similarity of decorative motifs on Trialeti pottery and those on Anatolian seals as evidence of interaction. While the stylistic parallel truly is quite compelling, the iconographic evidence for interaction provides us little hope in reconstructing an account of what interaction might mean in terms of the participating groups, organizing institutions, pathways across the landscape, stimuli to exchange, or changing senses of meaning and value from one context to another. As is the case with the Armenian Highland during the Early Bronze Age, what warrants exploration at present is why these connections appear to have been so weak. Emergent complexity: The Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages The first clear evidence for sociopolitical complexity in southern Caucasia appears in the Late Bronze Age (Fig. 8). The era is marked most conspicuously by the reappearance of numerous permanent settlements in the form of variably sized stone-masonry fortresses built atop hills and outcrops. These fortified settlements are often associated with large cemeteries, such as Treligorebi located on the outskirts of modern Tbilisi, Georgia. The transition between the Middle and Late Bronze Age is also marked by the introduction of new ceramic forms and decorative styles (Fig. 9)?most notably the disappearance of the painted pottery of the Karmir-Berd and Karmir-Vank horizons as well as the Sevan-Uzerlik horizon's punctate designs in favor of suites of black, gray, and buff wares with incised and pressed circumferen tial decorations (Areshian, Oganesyan, Muradyan, Avetisyan, &amp; Petrosyan, 1990; Badalyan et al., 2003; Khachatrian, 1979; Smith et ai, 2004). New approaches to metallurgical pro duction also mark a significant shift in social life between the Middle and Late Bronze Ages. Not only does the scale and intensity of production of bronze artifacts increase dramatically during the Late Bronze Age, both in quantity and in the diversity of forms and types (Avilova &amp; Chernykh, 1989, pp. 79-81), the repertoire of artifacts expands as well to include unique forms absent from earlier assemblages, such as battle-axes, mace-heads, shaft-hole daggers, bits, flanged-hilt weapons, and small statuettes. Furthermore, Late Bronze Age metallurgical production utilized open-work as well as lost wax casting (Gevorkyan, 1982, pp. 76-77). Both ceramic and metal material repertoires established during the Late Bronze Age en dured, in large measure, through the Early Iron Age as well. The term "Lchashen-Metsamor" ^ Springer</page><page sequence="37">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 265 horizon has recently been coined to describe the shared material culture which appears to unite the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages into a single archaeological horizon (Avetisyan et al, 1996). Thus the Early Iron Age is marked archaeologically by the emergence and expansion of iron implements but appears to have been continuous with the preceding era. It is important to note that while the end of the Bronze Age throughout much of the Near East and Mediterranean brought with it considerable destruction and tumult, this does not appear to be the case in southern Caucasia where the era is quite clearly marked archaeologically by continuity rather than rupture (cf. Drews, 1993; Pitskhelauri, 1979; Sandars, 1985). Although the archaeological record of the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages remains re markably pronounced on southern Caucasia's modern landscape, where cyclopean fortresses from the era appear to dot every hilltop, to date only a handful of sites have hosted intensive archaeological investigations. Among the most informative sites have been the settlements at Metsamor (Khanzadian et al, 1973), Horom South (Badaljan et al, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997), Shirakavan (Torosyan, Khnkikyan, &amp; Petrosyan, 2002), and Keti (Petrosyan, 1989) and the mortuary complexes at Artik (Khachatrian, 1979), Lchashen (Mnatsakanian, 1965), Lori-Berd (Devedzhian, 1981), Talin (Avetisyan &amp; Muradyan, 1994), Shirakavan (Torosyan et al, 2002) and Horom (Avetisyan &amp; Badaljan, 1996; Mkrtchyan, 2001). Recent work at ^ Springer</page><page sequence="38">266 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 Fig. 9 Late Bronze Age ceramics from the fortress of Tsaghkahovit (after Smith et al, 2004) sites such as Udabno (Pitskhelauri, 2003), Gegharot, and Tsaghkahovit (Avetisyan et al, 2000; Badalyan et al, 2003; Smith et al., 2004) have focused considerable attention on initial formation of complex societies in the South Caucasus. With the dawn of the Late Bronze Age, the social inequalities visible in the kurgans of the early second millennium appear to have been formalized into a tightly integrated sociopolitical apparatus where critical controls over resources?economic, social, sacred? were concentrated within the cyclopean stone masonry walls of powerful new centers. These political centers projected authority well into the hinterlands. Large-scale irrigation facilities first appear in the region in association with Late Bronze Age fortress complexes, suggesting significant centralized control over the agricultural productivity of the region (Kalantar, 1994). In addition, vast cemeteries appear coincident with the emergence of Late Bronze Age polities. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="39">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 267 Project ArAGATS conducted an archaeological survey in the Tsaghkahovit region of central Armenia in 1998 and 2000, recording a very high density of Late Bronze Age cemeteries (4.6 per square kilometer) in the mountain highlands immediately surrounding a series of adjacent fortresses. Given the lack of settlements (as opposed to fortresses) in the region, it is quite likely that a segment of the population may have continued the highly mobile ways of life that arose in the Middle Bronze Age, even as elites settled within fortified complexes. It is possible that the explosion in tombs and cemeteries in the Late Bronze Age was part of an effort by emergent sociopolitical authorities to increase the commitments of their subjects to a specific place (through ties between ancestral and descendant families and groups) and thus make them a more stable foundation for the demands of the extractive political economy. However, the relation between Middle Bronze Age mobility and the heavy tread of Late Bronze Age fortified citadels raises complex questions regarding the relationship between settled and mobile groups. The Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages are currently segmented into five basic phases. Middle Bronze IV/Late Bronze I (currently dated to roughly 1550-1450 B.C.) represents the initial transitional phase during which the Middle Bronze III horizons are replaced by mixed assemblages containing both Middle and Late Bronze ceramic styles, such as those documented at Lchashen (Martirosyan, 1964), Harich (Khachatrian, 1975) Artik (Khachatrian, 1979) and in a recently excavated kurgan at Gegharot. It is important to note that the earlier Middle Bronze traditions within these "mixed" assemblages are represented only by the punctate decorations of the Sevan-Uzerlik horizon, never by painted pottery, sug gesting that punctate decorative traditions predominated during the terminal Middle Bronze Age. The rapidity of this transition?little more than a century in the current reckoning?is quite remarkable. The second phase of the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1450-1250 B.C.) is marked by the disap pearance of Middle Bronze Age ornamental traditions and the emergence of a coherent new ceramic assemblage utilizing solely the new repertoire of incised, pressed, and burnished circumferential decorations located almost exclusively on the vessel shoulders. The era was marked by increased violence, at least when viewed from the fortress at Gegharot, which appears to have been destroyed twice during the Late Bronze II phase. Unfortunately, we do not have sufficiently robust archaeological datasets at present to define either what was at stake in these confrontations nor how authorities sustained and reproduced violence. It seems clear that the political deployment of violence was critical to the maintenance of authority in the South Caucasus since the Middle Bronze Age. However, the appearance of stable fortresses as loci for fixed institutions of social regulation and governance may well have been predicated upon a routinization of earlier, Middle Bronze Age forms of charismatic martial heroics into centralized instruments of discipline. The final phase of the Late Bronze Age (LB III, 1250-1150 B.C.) is distinguished archaeologically primarily in reference to a series of minor formal and decorative additions to the Late Bronze ceramic corpus, including, most emblematically, one-handled wide lipped cups and jugs and the lace-work handles of Sevan style daggers (Avetisyan, 2003). Most material culture forms and styles developed in the Late Bronze Age continued throughout the Early Iron Age. Examinations of materials recovered from mortuary contexts suggest that the Early Iron Age can be divided into two distinct phases: a transitional Early Iron I, dated conventionally to the late twelfth and eleventh centuries B.C., and an Early Iron II phase during the tenth and ninth centuries B.C. If the pivotal transformation from the Middle to Late Bronze Age socio-political commu nities lies in the increasing formalization of social inequalities that emerged upon the collapse of the Kura-Araxes horizon, then what were the sources of elite power and the structure of ^ Springer</page><page sequence="40">268 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 governmental institutions? Excavations in the cemetery complexes of the Tsaghkahovit plain and elsewhere suggest that during the Late Bronze Age, the ostentatious displays of social inequality known from the grand Middle Bronze Age kurgans moderate considerably. This is not to suggest that social inequality ameliorated. Quite the contrary, the demands placed by rulers quartered in fortified settlements likely intensified the social distance between elites and subjects. However, the expression of this distance in mortuary contexts took on less demonstrative forms, suggesting that the legitimacy of rule no longer rested as heavily in conspicuous displays of wealth but rather had been regularized into an enduring institutional order. Coda: To empire To return to where this article began, the Early Iron Age in southern Caucasia was brought to a close by the campaigns of Argishti I, King of Urartu, during the early eighth century B.C. The campaigns of the Urartian kings succeeded in subduing local polities and confederacies in the Ararat Plain and the Lake Sevan region but do not appear to have penetrated any farther north than the southern limits of the Shirak Plain (and the unique outpost on the north hill at Horom) nor to have incorporated territories east of the Ararat Plain in the mountainous areas of Nakhichevan (Azerbaijan) and Zangezur (Armenia). In much of southern Caucasia then, the arrival of Argishti may not have marked a major social or political transformation and the archaeology of the region, in large measure, reflects the continuation of a Lchashen Metsamor material substrate even within the citadels of the Urartian regime. The epigraphic and archaeological study of Urartu flourished in Soviet era southern Caucasia even as it languished on the other side of the Iron Curtain. Piotrovskii's (1950, 1952, 1955, 1959) investigations at Karmir-Blur were the first (and remain today the most extensive) systematic excavations of an Urartian site. Thanks to the work at Karmir-Blur, Martirosyan's (1974) excavations at Argishtihinili, Oganesian's (1961, 1980) research at Erebuni, Avetisyan's (2001) work at the small fortress of Aragats, and investigations by Esaian and Kalantarian (1988) and Kalantarian et al. (2003) at Oshakan, the Ararat plain is the most thoroughly investigated region of the Urartian empire (Fig. 10; it is important to note the extensive surveys of Urartian sites conducted in northwestern Iran by Wolfram Kleiss (1976); Kleiss &amp; Kroll (1977, 1978), anchored by the excavations at Bastam (Kleiss, 1979, 1988)). Concurrently, Soviet (and later, Armenian) epigraphers have compiled what remain to date the only encyclopedic compendia of Urartian texts (Arutyunian, 2001; Melikishvili, 1960, 1971). The study of Urartu, and its interpretive priorities, has thus cast a broad intellectual shadow across regional archaeology. The archaeology of Urartu within southern Caucasia has tended to focus on two pri mary issues: the cultural relationship between Urartu and Assyria and the nature of local communities that were incorporated within the Urartian empire. The former interest is one shared by Western archaeologists studying Urartu where the delineation of Urartu's cultural debt to Assyria has in many respects served as a proxy for an investigation of Urartian origins. Based on my ongoing collaborative field investigations of the Late Bronze Age of the Tsaghkahovit Plain (central Armenia), I have recently argued (Smith &amp; Thompson, 2004), that a tradition of political authority emerged in southern Caucasia at the dawn of the Late Bronze Age which provided the basic blueprint for early complex polities in the region, including the empire of Urartu. This is not to argue that the Urartian kings did not draw from sources to the south for elements of royal pomp and propaganda. The use of cuneiform for Urartian writing as well as aspects of royal art are the most conspicuous elements adopted from Mesopotamian traditions. However, these elements appear to have ^ Springer</page><page sequence="41">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 269 ?wi traw? *iwf Fig. 10 Map of Urartian era sites in southern Caucasia discussed in the text been relatively superficial to the constitution and exercise of Urartian political authority, disappearing quickly from the region following the demise of the Urartian dynasty. What endures, perhaps even into the succeeding Achaemenid and Hellenistic periods, is a southern Caucasian political tradition?a model for institutional order initially developed during the second half of the second millennium B.C. However, the Urartian kings clearly developed a unique implementation of this basic institutional blueprint which allowed them to supersede the small-scale political rivalries that appear to have limited the territorial ambitions of their predecessors. The second major preoccupation of research into the Urartian era in southern Caucasia centers on the relation between Urartu and the local populations it ultimately defeated and brought into the empire. This issue has received little attention in the West, where, as Zimansky (1995, p. 171) has cogently pointed out, there has been a strong tendency to conflate Urartu as "1) a geographical area, 2) a political unit, 3) an ethno-linguistic entity, and 4) an archaeological assemblage." As a result, there has been little conceptual space for distinguishing local populations from the hegemonic Urartian political apparatus or for defining socio-cultural heterogeneity underneath the heavy footprint of the empire. This has not been the case in Armenia, where there has been a sustained archaeological and epigraphic ^ Springer</page><page sequence="42">270 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 interest in distinguishing Urartian and local communities. In an epigraphic vein, this interest has tended to focus on Urartian toponyms (Arutyunian, 1985; Diakonoff &amp; Kashkai, 1981), particularly the geography of major local confederacies, such as Etiuni, who resisted the expansion of empire (Diakonoff, 1984). Archaeologically, the interest in defining the fate of the local during the era of Urartian domination has focused on identifying the elements of an archaeological repertoire continuous with pre-Urartian traditions in contrast to the repertoire associated with Urartian imperialism. In archaeological terms, the Urartian imperial apparatus in southern Caucasia is marked by the same distinctive metal (Merhav, 1991), architectural (Kafadaryan, 1967,1984; Kleiss, 1975, 1982, 1994; Oganesian, 1955, 1961; Smith, 1996), and ceramic assemblages (Emre, 1969; Kroll, 1976; French &amp; Summers, 1994) that followed the march of empire across other parts of the Armenian Highland, including the well-known red-slipped and polished wares known traditionally as Toprakkale or palace wares (Burney &amp; Lang, 1972; see Zimansky, 1985,1998 for broader discussions of the archaeology of Urartu). However, the vast majority of ceramics from Urartian era sites in southern Caucasia are not traditional palace wares, such as those documented at sites in the Urartian heartland around Lake Van. Instead, we find two major groups of locally produced wares. First, the majority of red-slipped wares from Urartian era sites in Armenia are locally produced "Ararat Valley wares" (Avetisyan, 1992; Avetisyan &amp; Avetisyan, 2006) rather than imports from the Urartian heartland. The scale and prominence of regional production raises the question as to how ceramic manufacturing related to local governance. Were these wares emulations of heartland vessels commissioned by local elites anxious to recreate in the periphery the material world familiar from the metropole? Or were they simply local equivalents of palace wares generated by a standardized ceramic industry transplanted into a new locale? Second, the largest corpus of Urartian period ceramics from southern Caucasia overall is neither comprised by valley wares nor palace wares, but rather grey, buff, and black wares continuous with Early Iron Age traditions. At the site of Horom, on Urartu's northern border, red slipped wares accounted for only one percent of the Urartian era assemblage relative to buff and grey/black wares continuous with local Late Bronze and Early Iron Age traditions. Nevertheless, the comparatively small assemblage of red wares included all of the basic forms of the traditional Urartian assemblage (Kohl &amp; Kroll, 1999, p. 253). It is quite tempting to interpret the distinctive suites of grey and red ceramics as indicative of social boundaries between occupying "Urartian" elites and "indigenous" subjugated populations. And this may indeed be correct. However, far more attention needs to be given to the social significance of variation in the Urartian material assemblage in southern Caucasia and in other parts of the empire. Recent investigations at Horom (Badafjan et al., 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997), Aragats (Avetisyan, 1996), and the Sevan Basin (Biscione, Hmayakyan, &amp; Parmegiani, 2002) as well as new excavations at Aramus (Avetisyan, 1997), in the Hrazdan river valley, promise to shed considerable new light on the constitution of social boundaries within the Urartian world. The end of the Urartian era in southern Caucasia is known almost solely through the charred remains of Karmir-Blur and the appearance of tri-Iobed points in its mudbrick walls, a discovery which led Piotrovskii (1959) to implicate Scythian armies in Urartu's final demise. I have elsewhere suggested that Urartu's collapse was remarkably complete, such that within two centuries not only had the southern Caucasian political tradition been replaced by other models of governance, even the memory of Urartu had virtually disappeared (Smith, 2003, p. 254; Smith &amp; Thompson, 2004). However, recent work on the post-Urartian period (Khatchadourian, in press) suggests that the impact of Urartu and the southern Caucasian political tradition may well have endured for centuries after its collapse. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="43">J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 271 Southern Caucasia in the world of Eurasia and the Near East In Plato's Protagoras (320d-322d) Prometheus's brother Epimetheus, is charged with giving unique faculties to all the animals of the earth. To the predator went strength and claws, to the prey went speed and disguise. But Epimetheus ran out of unique qualities before he got to humans. When Prometheus arrived to check on his brother's progress, he found humankind "naked, unshod, unbedded, unarmed." To aid them, as the story goes, Prometheus famously purloined fire and wisdom in the arts from Hephaestus and Athena in order to provide for the survival of the species. A succinct prehistory is bound up in the figure of Prometheus, one which links anthropo logical traditions of social transformation to archaeographic conventions for writing regional summaries. In an anthropological sense, the myth of Prometheus neatly distills the mod ernist civilizational stories that anthropology and archaeology have told since the nineteenth century. Within the long and enduring tradition of social evolution derived from both Lewis Henry Morgan and V. Gordon Childe, the advent of new technologies generates a new set of social relations much as fire in the Prometheus story replaced the master-slave relation be tween gods and humans with a far more complex set of social relations that divided humans into discrete communities and factionalized the Olympians themselves. The Prometheus story would fit quite well within a modernist account of early state formation which argues that from technological innovation follows social transformation. In an archaeographic sense, the Prometheus myth deftly echoes contemporary con ventions for writing regional prehistory. Archaeologists often treat global prehistory like Epimetheus, where each region is accorded a unique contribution to world heritage. As a result of this narrative structure, the significance of a given region is rendered in terms of either technological "firsts"?domestication, writing, bronze working, etc.? or aesthetic marvels?the standard of Ur, the palette of Narmer, the Temple of the Sun. It is certainly possible to write narratives for the South Caucasus that praise a se ries of techno-social firsts: the innovative trappings of early horse riding warriors or later the engineering of medieval domes and arches critical to gothic construction tech niques. We can also point to a series of aesthetic triumphs unique to the region, such as and the marvels of Tsnori's golden lion or the Karashamb goblet. But this is a rather strained and somewhat cliched way to describe the region's impact in the wider world, one which serves to burnish the traditional civilizational aesthetic derived from nineteenth century collectors rather than open the field to a more pluralist sense of human trial and accomplishment. For example, it is tempting to render the southern Caucasian political tradition that emerged during the Late Bronze Age as a very early blueprint for a feudal landscape dotted with stone masonry castles defended by a horse-riding martial aristocracy. However, it is more salient to regional prehistory to note that this political tradition ultimately? in the political body of Urartu?provided a major geopolitical counterweight to Assyrian military adventurism and Cimmerian and Scythian piratical incursions. Indeed there is a more general sense, visible when the region's prehistory is taken in a larger view, in which the South Caucasus has long provided alternative visions of community, drawing the Armenian Highland together into a distinct sphere which appears to have had conspicuously little to do with neighbors to the south. This is effectively an argument for a close account of local institutions and sociologies rather than a prehistory that looks primarily to the advent of new technologies and global interactions to explain historical dynamics. This is, in other words, a plea to unbind us from our Promethean prehistories. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="44">272 J World Prehist (2005) 19:229-279 Acknowledgments Although the errors in this contribution are all mine, whatever I got right is largely thanks to my colleague, Dr. Ruben Badalyan of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography in Yerevan.
