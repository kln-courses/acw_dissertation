<plain_text><page sequence="1">Miquel Desclot. Cancons de la lluna al barret. Barcelona. Edicions 62. 1978. 99 pages. Joining the rich resources of an ingenious mind with the creative playfulness of a childlike imagination, Miquel Desclot (born Miquel Munoz) produces a poetic genre which - true to the nature of the thing of beauty that it is - promises to be a joy forever. The title itself, translatable as "Songs of the Moon upon Your Cap," is emblematic of the kind of whimsical imagery which flourishes in Desclot's booklet. These cancons present a paradoxical blend of traditional and avant-gardist tech- niques even as they display a bravura of eclectic inventive- ness reminiscent of J. V. Foix's peculiar combinations of conventional and ultramodern lyricism. While reflecting inspiration from a wide array of sources, ranging from the jingles of children's doggerel to the strains of folkloric balladry, Desclot's muse succeeds in harmonizing echoes from such disparate influences as Espronceda's romantic verve, Lorca's oneiric settings and anthropomorphic metaphors, Neruda's pantheistic vital- ism and E. E. Cummings's protean artistry. Within such cleverly orchestrated polyphony, the zestful beat of nursery rhymes provides fit complementation for the tonality of piquant eroticism. Often in Desclot's multifaceted collec- tion the heady fragrances of naive versifying subtly merge with sobering whiffs of tongue-in-cheek understatements. No mean accomplishment is Desclot's ability to mold a remarkable variety of motifs together with deceptively simple structures into an overriding homogeneity of style which still holds in store for the reader alluring prospects of serendipity at every turn. At the heart of Desclot's every poem we witness a daring as well as victorious venture into the twilight zone between meaning and nonsense. This author's intriguing approach to poetry attests to a primeval tension between wit and absurdity, the former struggling to subject the latter to the constraints of a quasi- syllogistic pattern. Desclot commands recognition on the part of any lover of literature. Unfortunately, Edicions 62 has not seen fit to include even the scantiest details concerning the poet's life and career.
