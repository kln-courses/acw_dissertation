Polar . . . you mean lhal he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth ? In heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, which he who derives may behold, and beholding, may take up his abode there. But whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact, is no matter; for he will live after the manner of that city, having nothing to do with any other. Plato, Politeia, IX, 592. In this paper I propose to lay down the thesis—new, seemingly one-sided and bold—that responsibility for Ihe future (especially for the far-away, but also for the near future) forms the central core, is the crystallized essence of all responsibility of any kind, always and everywhere. Further, Ihat, this responsibility for the future is not only the allencompassing responsibility, but is even prior to and a primary condition of man's responsibility in and for the present. Its function is considered to be fundamental for human behavior as human behavior, pertaining both to mankind as a whole and to man as an individual. To support this sweeping proposition, purposely strained here to its ultimate implications and farthest extensions, a structured network of systematic justification would have to be constructed, which cannot possibly be expounded in this short paper \ Here I can only indicate some very broad out 1 I can only refer to my two-volume Dutch work De Toekomst is Verleden Tijd, Utrecht 1955, of which English and German translations are now in preparation.</page><page sequence="2">RESPONSIBILITY FOB THE FUTUBE AND THE FAR-AWAY 101 lines of an unavoidably still rather apodictic character, in an endeavor to clarify the main ideas of this train of thought related to the future. The reader should be warned that these ideas stem from (and lead to) an integrated but deviating view of the basic principles and modern orientations regarding our image of man and human activity. These latter are mirrored in the now current conceptions of (1) cultural anthropology, (2) philosophy, (3) religion, (4) psychology, (5) science, and (6) the social sciences. Particularly in connection with the dissenting interpretation of responsibility, this view implies a constructive criticism of prevailing doctrines of (7) the philosophy and (8) science of history, of (9) the socio logy of culture and social dynamics, and, finally, of (10) social ethics. It is in this same order that I would like to develop the argument and then draw my conclusions. I. (1) Cultural anthbopology 2 a) The basic point of departure for this study is the unique structure of the human mind, somehow evolved in an archaic phase of the psychophysical evolution of life on earth. This highly specific mental structure is dualistic. Man is the one animal able to pass the frontier of present reality. Man is the only living being who consciously can split reality in two: into the existing, concretely observable situation and an other, inventively conceived, not-existing state of being. Homo sapiens thus is "split man" and in this creative capacity as split man he distinguishes himself from and rises above a purely animalistic or vitalistic state. He can behave purpose fully and biseclionally as a "cilizen-of-two-worlds". He can live in the environmental here-and-now, but simultaneously, 2 This term is not unambiguous. In some countries the term "philosophical anthropology" is used to denote approximately the same as is meant here, viz. dealing with the questions, what and why is man ? Others hold that "cultural anthropology" should be restricted to a more ethnological and prehistorical sense: what and where is the origin of man ? This is not meant here.</page><page sequence="3">102 FRED. L. POLAK by using the unique splitting faculties of his mind and the force of his free imagination, he can live in another world or universe of his own creation. This other world, the noble product of man's fertile mind, may be quite different from the present one, or possibly the opposite in many or all respects. The developing of this typical dualism marks the most significant milestone in the almost unknown process of birth and growth of human civilization. It is the main explanation of the progressive bifurcation between nature and nurture. It starts a biological species of homo off on its amazing career as Man the Maker of civilization. b) At some prehistoric point man proves able not only to split off from physical reality another, different, and as it were metaphysical, world, as real or more real than his immediate surroundings; he also finds out how to connect this distinctive thought-process, adding a new spatial dimension to his world-view, with another equally revolutionary con quest by mental division and expansion. He now becomes conscious of time and of a temporal dimension. Sharp dis tinctions between past, present and future are not found at the beginning but, as a rule, towards the end of this process of development. This, however, need not be gone into here. What is highly relevant, however, is the fact that by splitting both space and time another reality can be thought of as exist ing in another sphere, different from the day-to-day present in which man is actually living and perceiving the events, in fact happening palpably to him and around him. It does not matter how the extent or content of the other time-span is measured or indicated, as an other period, era, eon or epoch, only that it, is different and distanced from the present moment in the here and now. In wrenching itself free from the oppressive grip of the here-now, the human mind was spir itually emancipating itself from spatio-temporal limits and lias ever since been trying to cross the border of the unknown, to push back the boundaries of the dark realm of space-time towards ever-receding, infinite horizons. It will work un relentingly to grasp the non-existent: the once-existent, the to-be-existent, or the (in a higher sense) eternally-existent. But whether this other reality is thought to have existed pre viously, to be yet to come or to be inherent in all time, it</page><page sequence="4">RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FUTURE AND THE FAR-AWAY 103 can only be imaginatively conceived by mental pictures, and be communicated in the language of images. c) The next and most important step, following the evolu tion of time-consciousness and the mental splitting of the continuous time-flow into different parts such as "earlier", "later" and "always", is the separate and definite conception of a time not now existent but still to come. Only at this dis tinct stage of thought, intentionally directed towards pro spective, perhaps far-off times, is the growing difference of degree between man and animal fully developed into a qualitative difference. As soon as such conceptions as "later", "coming", "ahead", "beyond", "forward" or "future" are explicitly and systematically detached from the undifferen tiated stretch of the time-continuum, the real story of man is set into motion. d) I am not at all competent to judge the possible con nections between this extremely significant generating power of conscious fore-thought in man and his biological or bio genetical differentiation. Attractive speculations about these correlations inevitably present themselves to the layman. To mention only a few: man's erect posture as a biped seems to point towards and accentuate his capacity for looking and moving ahead towards distant and ramified vistas and pano ramas. His unique binocular vision seems to tell and foretell of his visionary opening and breaking through this world towards a far-away perspective; it tells of his potential grasp of dimensions of length, height and depth, his range of visual perception, and his capacity for seeing through the present (perspicaciously) with an outlook 011 far prospects. The extraordinary development of his brains and mental apparatus might well be proportioned and adapted to the fast-growing needs of powerful imagination, needs to create or transfer magnetically appealing images of the non-existent or at least of the unseen and unheard, in the sensory reality of his tangible present. Let us leave these interrelations of mental and physical growth for whatever they are worth. I do believe, in any case, that once man was ready to start thinking more or less consciously and purposefully about the future, on a time-scale extending from tomorrow to the end of time or infinity, a</page><page sequence="5">104 fred. L. POLAK necessary, let us say "psychosomatic" condition had been ful filled for man to elevate himself above the previous state of mental barrenness of the ape-men and cave-men, and even, eventually, above that of the crude homo faber. He is thus liberated to become the ingenious builder of those other non natural worlds, to be called civilizations. Then the future comes into its own, as an almost bound less enlargement of the narrow world-view of man. Fore thought and foresight enter into the world scene with a tre mendous and unforeseen scope and bearing. The future is to form the central category, to be the guiding star of all incipient cultural activity and of the successive upswinging leaps of the human mind along the agelong road of "progress". Both the idea and reality of a forward-moving human civiliza tion are absolutely unthinkable without the preceding mental development of forward-thinking. (2) and (3) Philosophy and Religion a) For this audience of expert philosophers one might be tempted to summarize the complicated process of growth of philosophy in one sentence: "I think about Ihe future, there fore I am". Philosophy, in the frame of reference presupposed here, might be seen as the general expression of intellecting lime-consciousness and as the successive attempts at transla lion of man's increasing awareness of Ihe future. Cosmic mythology and philosophy cover time from Ihe first beginning of this world to its last stage and transition lo anolher world. They are concerned with a range from créa I ion to re-creation, or from one lime-cycle to the next in an endless time-motion. Again, here, it is irrelevant whether the time-flow is supposed to take ils course in a straight or dialectically upward moving line, in eternal recurrance or in a spiral, or in an undulatory rhythm. It is only contended that these are all, however divergent, based on a definite notion of time and, specifically, of coming time. All true philosophy is essentially meta physical &lt;ime-philosophy, from Plato to Plotinus and Augus tinus, from Kant and Hegel lo Bergson, Husserl or Heidegger. I think it is no exaggeration to say that the historic rise and fall of systems of philosophy is intertwined with fun</page><page sequence="6">RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FUTURE AND THE FAR-AWAY 105 damental shifts in the accompanying trends of changing lime-conceptions, or, to be very concise, with the correspond ing rise and fall of their inherent previsions of the future. No need here to signal the classical Platonic ideas as sublime and subtle models and mirrors not only of Plato's own time, Antiquity at its peak, but, even more, as universal pre-reflections of an inspired and timeless future for mankind. They are prototypes of what I propose to indicate in this paper as positive and constructive "images of the future". They inspire and direct man to reach out above himself; to strive from generation to generation towards another and better time. b) However, I would feel free to mention here one point, which we in our sophistication are likely to forget. I mean that Plato explicitly and paradoxically has bequeathed to posterity the most essential cue to the meaning and working of the image of the future. It is the very cue which serves as point of departure and main theme of this paper, the concept of the "split man". In his way Plato stresses "split man" as I he means to all goals of progress—an evolution which is of course directly related to the future. In the famous dialogue of Phaedrus, pertaining to the soul of man and its capacity to envisage the highest ideas, he has Socrates literally saying: "The greatest good comes to mankind through madness, as a divine gift". As Plato's further elucidation shows, such "divine mad ness" is attached by Socrates to four types of "split person ality", to which, from other expositions in Plato's works, might be added a fifth one. These divinely gifted ecstatic minds are found in (1) the divining prophets and seers, (2) the poetically be-mused, (3) Ihose pre-elected for ritual and religious madness, (4) those exalted by erotic madness, and, finally, (5) in those chosen for inspiration by or naturally endowed with an affinity for god-sent dreams of therapeutic or predictive significance. In each of these five cases the relation to the future is a direct and personal one. Prophets are revealing and unveiling the future. Poets tell, in coming back to earth, of their pre visions of the invisible other world of pure beauty. Ritualistic religious ecstasy penetrates into the super-natural beyond</page><page sequence="7">106 FRED. L. POLAK or passes temporarily into the absolute, extra-temporal realm of divine truth. Erotic love (in the true Platonic sense, so often misunderstood nowadays) leads over, through sub limated passion, to the other, higher world of the spirit, the immortal soul and the eternal Platonic ideas of the good and just. Whatever one is inclined to Ihink of this Socratic-Platonic dissertation on "divine madness", I myself am convinced that the common element in these special types of Platonic "schi zophrenia", viz. being directed towards and inspired by the future, is of the utmost importance. Prophets, poets, ecsta tics, lovers and dreamers—their flames are kindled by the same spark, sprung from the future. Here we meet the prime movers, the driving spiritual and emotional forces of basic human behavior, at work in their most striking form. c) In regard to the future, philosophy and religion are closely tied together, both having roots deeply planted in the same dualistic structure of the human mind. With only a slight change of nuance it might be stated succinctly that, all true religion is prophetic, that it is essentially meta-historic fime-religion. Cosmic speculation and myths, reflecting age old beliefs concerning the whence and whither, ranging from "in the beginning" to "the last things", merging the "once upon a time" of the fairy-tale or legend with the "and after wards they will live for a long time" 3 of paradise regained —this is the cradle of any primitive religion. The idea of God and the development of religious worship are unthinkable without the corresponding idea of God shaping the future of man as promised or prewritten by Him according to a fore ordained destiny. If the future were fully known or com pletely predictable by using man's mind or reason, or his sixth sense or second sight, the modern world-religions could in my opinion neither have originated and developed to their present form, nor (probably) have existed in any other form. Religion is partial revelation of the book closed by seven seals. The heart of this revelation is the certainty of coming glory, blessedness and salvation, in some way and at some time, for 3 This is the more moderate European expression. The shorter, more sweeping Anglo-Saxon translation reads: and they lived happily forever after.</page><page sequence="8">RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FUTURE AND THE FAR-AWAY 107 some people on certain conditions. The core of its prophetic message is a basically positive image of the future. God is initial Promise and final Fulfillment. A. divine future is the pre-existent premise of God. The idea of time, pregnant with the uplifted future, cannot be removed, can not even be sub stituted by that of a non-conceivable eternity, without involv ing the idea of God. God cannot live by bread of the past present alone. This view is in direct contrast with conceptions such as the Freudian, according to which religion came into being and developed in compensation for infantile guilt-complexes and repressed atavistic impulses. Without denying their influence, I hold that we should not so much look back to the unconscious driving forces and motivations of a prehistoric past, as forward to the elevating force of powerfully pro pelling "images of the future". The anthropomorphic gods of the past were never stronger than the potential force of the images of the future which they had inspired and which they were expected to actualize. The Christian faith is born in and vastly expanded by the glad tidings about the coming future, previewed in the "evangelic" preaching and teaching of Jesus. Christianity is indissolubly united with his revelation of God's pro vidential intentions and promises for the future of man. The Revelation of Saint John the Divine specifically bears a title which could be given both to the Old and the New Testament. All religion is concerned with a projected future and can only survive through concern for this future. Religion, as it has thusfar evolved, has been wholly dependent on man's dualistic mental structure. Only by virtue of this time-splitting capa city can man think religiously, that is futuristically about cosmic infinity, immortality of the soul, reincarnation or transmigration, about re-creation at the apocalyptic end of time, the being and becoming of human life on earth, heaven, hell or the Great Reyond, and finally, about the coming of the Kingdom of God, in consummation of His predetermined Plan of eternal harmony for the created universe and the creature He made in His image. In short, religion is based on the crystallization and interpretation of eschatological "images of the future". The rise and fall of religions cor</page><page sequence="9">108 fred. L. POLAK responds to the vitality or disintegration of their basic images of the future. (4) Individual and social psychology Some basic human drives and reactions are rooted in man's splitting off an unborn and thus unknown part of the time-flow, that which is yet to come. Conversely, these same drives and reactions may in turn urge further mental probing into this future. As soon as man becomes aware of its separate existence (or essence), the future draws towards itself man's heartfelt expectations, hopes, yearnings, delusive dreams and evasive illusions into one, entangled but concentrated, whole of wish-oriented and optimistic thinking. On the other hand, however, repeated non-realization, unexpected doom or a continuous stream of disasters and cruel scourges of nature may paralyze a cheerful and adventurous confidence in the future. They may also shift the expected blessing from the near to the far future, or unchain or intensify deep instincts of uncertainty, anxiety and naked fear. Rudely awakened from pleasant dreaming and careless living from hand to mouth, touched by the sharp finger of piti less time, man wants to know, to know more and to know in advance; he wants to be informed about his fate as well as possible. Even warning foreknowledge of bad news seems better than continued ignorance and doubt. And there are, perhaps, ways of making the future behave well, if you can invent and do the right things in the right place at the right time for the right, superhuman powers. A new inventiveness sprouts from man's thinking about the future. It is now no longer sufficient to know that there is such a thing as a "later" in time. Man has to discover at all costs how this coming time will work on him and how he can make it work for him.4 Here is the origin of all magic 4 This is the beginning of a distinction which becomes of extreme importance in history, the distinction between what I have labelled "essence-optimism" (or -pessimism) and "influence-optimism" (or -pessimism). It is the difference between the "laissez-faire" of "il tnondo va da se" (the world goes of itself) and the self-determination of human destiny, inherent in the concept of the dignity of man.</page><page sequence="10">RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FUTURE AND THE FAR-AWAY 109 und mantic arts, of esoteric priestly knowledge and prophetic divination, of foretokens of any kind. Only if and when more is known about the future does the development of new economic systems of providing for human wants become possible. Agriculture, navigation, enterprise and engineering all presuppose some basic fore knowledge and, once experimented with, further stimulate various methods of securing a reasonable base of reliable expectations. But neither idle curiosity nor compelling need can in themselves sufficiently explain the increasing drive towards exploration and anticipation of the future. Man cannot become truly and fully man, cannot attain the summit of human dignity—a summit rediscovered in Antiquity by Ihe Renaissance—cannot evolve towards his final maturity in the Kantian sense, if he cannot simultaneously elaborate and refine his mental picture of another world in a coming time. The image may be eschatological or Utopian, but this image of the future, infusing man with the fore knowledge of a destiny of happiness and harmony, haunts him and challenges him to work for its realization. It is an unborn child seeking to be delivered and promising deliver ance to man. The search for the future and various expecta tional attitudes have become basic 1o man's behavior, alternating between eager hope and bitter despair, between the Faustian, forward-driving faith and the frozen or frantic grip of fear. (5) and (6) Natural and social sciences The natural beginning of natural science also lies in man's ability to split reality and time, to create another world or another time. This process of creative thought, the bring ing to life of Ihe non-existent and thus distancing oneself from concrete reality makes abstract distinctions and mental operations with various hypothetical and perhaps contrasting axiomatic systems possible. Eventually this refinement of distinctions will lead to the opposition of good and evil, of true and false, of principal and accessory. Division and differentiation also form Ihe point of</page><page sequence="11">110 FRED. L. POLAK departure for problem-probing, for doubt, discontent, dis sent, for questioning of time-honored traditions and finally lead to criticism and non-conformity, to dialectic renewal or fundamental reversal in some cases resulting in a logical con sequence of revolt and revolution. This amazing capacity of man to change real things by ideal thoughts is the gushing fountain from which I he first tentative specimens of sys tematic theory are ejected in partly pre-scientific and often miscarrying efforts. Mythology, epic and tragic fiction, astrology, natural philosophy and cosmology are all attempts at a theoretic treatment of the future course of history, on the basis of previous events or legends and contemporaneous observations or suppositions. They result from the undeterred quest after the determinants and dominants of human happenings and happiness. What are the agents or instruments, the auguries or auspices of divine will? What fateful forces are forging the future? Where is the dividing line between the hidden super-human and the emergent human power? Tireless spe culation about such questions cannot but lead, in the end, to the scientific reasoning process: if a, then b— i.e. to the methodical discovery of the relations between a and b in time. Physical sciences and technology (translating such time relations into an effective process of time-saving) rise out of the ambivalence of faith in and fear of the future. Then, too, there are repeated early attempts systematically to apply similar causal time-principles, time-sequences and even time-laws to the intriguing problems of human history, society and culture. As a successor to prophetic religion and political philosophy, social science now tries to prognosticate and predict the future course of events. This is the ambitious undertaking of Francis Bacon and Adam Smith, Condorcet and Comte, Hegel and Marx, Spencer and Spengler, ending in the systems of Toynbee and Sorokin in our own time. Prac tically all the older attempts have already been buried by Father Time himself, as unfulfilled prophecies, leaving only the disgraced memory of their errors, and the now prevailing conviction that basic principles of social and cultural dynamics obviously do not exist.</page><page sequence="12">RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FUTURE AND THE FAR-AWAY 111 (7) The philosophy of history As soon as man's eyes are opened to the flow of lime towards a future, which is probably different from both present and past, two insoluble enigmas are posed: the prob lem of change and the problem of meaning. Changes can be captured, perhaps, in the iron cage of cause and effect, although in history we are never sure what is cause, and what is effect. Consequently causal reconstruction seemingly goes on forever, without any prospect of reaching the haven of universal validity for the historical past. More precarious, still, is the situation with respect to the interpretation of the meaning of history. From Bossuet, who gives the orthodox theological explanation of history as following the pattern designed and only partially revealed by Providence, we now have come back in a wide circle to the unorthodox theological explanation of Toynbee, who gives us a more modern version of approximately the same idea. In the meantime, however, the former unshakeable belief in God as personally determin ing all historical events down to the smallest detail is no longer a living faith. Even His dramatic reappearance at the end of time for the final act of closing history has receded into the remoteness of heavenly shrouds. But the contrary belief, equally unshakeable in the last two centuries, that man himself would direct history towards the ultimate goals for the good society by the reasoning power of his mind and an innate drive towards evolutionary progress is equally shattered. Existentialist belief-systems about the utterly meaningless meaning of earthly history now tend to prevail widely in our world. The philosophy of history thus seems to have dropped in a bottemless pit, or, worse even, is cursed to a never-ending Sisyphus-like rolling of human history uphill, only to fall back again and again. (8) The science of history a) The combined previous failures of the social sciences lo find socio-cultural time-laws or general regularities of the same precision and constancy as in the natural sciences, and</page><page sequence="13">112 FRED. L. POLAK the self-confessed failure of the philosophy of history to ascertain the inner or outer meaning of the historical process, have left most modern scholars discouraged or at least very sceptical of all attempts to catch the elusive lime-continuum in all-inclusive absolutistic systems. Even more modest attempts to lay theoretical foundations for the scientific pur suit of historical studies are looked upon with suspicion. Some are inclined flatly to reject history from the globus scienliarum, the inner circle of science, on these grounds. It is, indeed, now rather easy lo ridicule many of the single links in a long chain of indomitable attempts to make history a science. It is easy to demonstrate the pitfalls, the completely subjective judgments and the unscientific methods of our predecessors. But in my opinion if the history of the exact sciences proves anything, it is that we have often learned much more from abortive trials and even utter failures than from small refinements of existing theories. Neither Riemann nor Einstein could have achieved their formidable advances without the blood, sweat and tears of their forerunners, who by mischance went partially or completely wrong. Their dead-end trails, however, gave indispensable clues to new paths of progress. There is a very good chance that com parable lessons could be drawn from the history of history. We should not give up too early. b) Unflinchingly, we must return again and again to the cardinal questions: why and where did these systems of great thinkers go awry? If we succeed in unraveling their true and false elements, there is no reason, even less an excuse, not to try anew. Here, too, I must restrict my exposition severely. I can only give some remarks on the outcome of my own analysis. All famous philosophies and systematic theories of history have a meta-physical foundation and use the same logical method of extrapolation of their fundamental thesis. They all have in common that they are based on axiomatic, though divergent and often mutually exclusive time-philophies. By making deductions from this aprioristic and not always explicit foundation, they are able to formulate predictive statements about the probable course of events in the future. These two facts account for both their strength and their</page><page sequence="14">RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FUTURE AND THE FAR-AWAY 113 weakness: strength in the powerful consistency, weakness in the arbitrary foundation. Only when the Lime-philosophy itself is brought before the fire of open criticism, and only when it can be convinc ingly shown to be valid or at least extremely useful as a working hypothesis, will the further theoretical implications be valuable. These conditions, as a rule, have not been ful filled. The main objection which, in my opinion, could be made against all existing theories in this field is that they all derive their predictions on the future from the past-present segments of the time-flow. I, however, am convinced that a well-founded diagnosis and subsequent prognosis can only be made and justified if the segment of the time-flow labelled "future" is also included as an independent and co-determin ing entity. What I say here means that the unborn future, to be predicted, should already enter into a preceding phase of the analysis, because it is already at work and with us, in advance of becoming an apparent part of reality. The unborn, not-yet-existent future is already of potential prominence in the concrete reality of the past-present. This has always been true and the future is therefore absolutely indispensable in any time-formula that wishes to enlighten the tortuous and mys terious path of history. Having said this, we are now in a position to take op the thread leading through the labyrinth of history where courageous explorers got entangled and could not but fail. They were unable to find the way out because they neglected to chart it beforehand on their maps, although it was close at hand all the time. Could they, then, have done so? Is this not, indeed, the quadrature of the circle, or walking into the traps of the ill-famed petitio principii or circular reasoning? Just take a superficial look at history, and see whether the course of future events would not have been better known in broad outline if more study had been devoted to the future itself. I mean to that potential future, which was foreshadowed by radiating "images of the future", working their way towards the real future through their magnetic mass-appeal and the massive expansion of influence-optimism in the forward striv</page><page sequence="15">114 FRED. L. POLAR ings and active aspirations of man.5 These images of the future not only reflected the shape of things to come in the present: they gave shape to these things and promoted their very coming. The images of the future and their prophels were wriling the history of the future—they made history by creating this future, by fulfilling their own prophecies. They were like powerful time-bombs, exploding in the future, releasing a mighty stream of energy flowing back towards the present which is then pushed and pulled to that future. c) The term "images of the future" is used here for those condensed and crystallized expectations prevailing among peoples in certain periods and developed into systematic pro jections towards the future. They may be eil her of a trans cendental-religious character, pertaining mainly to the end of lime or the last things (eschatological), or they concern them selves mainly with social-humanitarian ideals for the good society on earth (utopian). An illustration of some concrete cases will tell more in less ppace than a further abstract exposition. The history of human civilization abounds with future-forming images of the future, supplementing and supplanting each other in a continuous golden chain, welded together by the world's greatest prophets, philosophers, poeis, humanists, idealists, saints, scholars, in short, by visionary men of genius and thought-provoking pioneers. I will men tion a few such models of (literally) world-moving and revolutionizing images of the future. There is, for example, the final glorious resurrection of Israel predicted and glowingly painted by the Jewish prophets, inspired by Jahwe. There is the coming Kingdom of God, the glad tidings voiced with the most stirring wealth of imagery by Jesus and recorded in the Gospels; the Millennium of peace, joy and justice mystically depicted in the Revelation of St. John; the presentation of the City of God by Augustine; the Ideal State of Plato and the Utopia of Thomas More. There is also the new conception of Francis Bacon that (natural and technical) knowledge = power; the ideals of Human Dignity and Self-Determination of human destiny established in the Renaissance; the proclaimed faith in Progress and Perfectability 5 See note 4.</page><page sequence="16">RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FUTURE AND THE FAR-AWAY 115 by the Age of Enlightenment and Reason; the Utopian con structions of Rousseau and Kant; the cry for Liberty, Equality and Fraternity ringing out through the French Revolution; the belief in the divine and self-evident harmony of individual and general interest evoked by classical liberalism; the firm conviction of the coming classless and stateless society pro pagated by scientific Marxism. Finally, there is the American Dream which, living in nameless immigrants and pioneers and activated by the Founding Fathers, formed the spiritual dynamic for the creation of The New World. d) In short, history is seen in another perspective if re viewed as the history of man's images of the future. These images tell the unfolding story of mankind. They foretell and unveil futures which in the meantime have become veri fiable pasts. They might today give the right answers on the unknown future over which we now wonder and worry, if the right questions are put to them. (9) Cultural sociology and social dynamics a) Let us here retrace our main steps through the history of civilization. First, and most important of all is man's dualislic mental capacity to imagine another world and another time, radically different from the present. Spiritual leaders and visionary messengers emerge. They evolve con structive images of the future, painting a picture of another, coming world as a better world. Through their intellectual insight, but even more through their emotional and aesthetic appeal these images designed by the elite are communicated to the masses, and arouse their enthusiasm and burning belief. The world is set aflame by these dominating, directing forces towards that other and better future. The promises and prospects, contained in these pre-visions and predictions, projected from the earth towards heaven in illuminated con tours, are bursting through the historical past-present and breaking open the hidden present-future. They make a purposeful choice between a great many possible futures and harness the elected potential future into active operation. They form the essence of the mysterious and miraculous pro</page><page sequence="17">116 FRED. L. POL AK cess of germinating human civilizations, brightly colored butterflies flying out and upwards from the covering crysalis of a mankind chained to this chaotic and barbaric earth. They, also, help to explain the specific uniqueness of each of these ancient cultures or separate culture-configurations. b) The conversion of seemingly static and unchangeable eons into dynamically exploding transitions or even over turnings of time, the transformation of immense and almost infinitely darkened lengths of time into an imperceptible but undeniable creative evolutionary process (which may again be nipped in the bud, or bloom only to decay)—these meta morphoses have placed squarely before us the central problem of all true philosophy of history and culture. Primum vivere, deinde philosophari: a better insight into these dynamic but enigmatic time-forces working in the field of human history is still, perhaps more than ever, of the most vital importance. Our personal responsibility—both as human beings and as scientific workers—is directly involved here. To try for a responsible, adequate and timely answer means to venture some further bold steps, or, per force, even to make a bold plunge into the unknown future. c) It is here that we must put to the test our intention to include the future as an independent and as it were pre-existent magnitude in our prognostic time-calculations. Pressed into a stenographically abbreviated and thus too short proposition this new time-formula for social and cultural dynamics would read as follows: The prophetic, inspired proclamation and inspiring pro pagation of positive, mass-moving images of the future form the main generating process of the birth and growlh of cul ture-patterns. Cultures in their realistic unfolding tend gradually to climb a staircase of spiritual progress carved out of the non-existent with the tools of the mind and heart. Cultures are the human expression of the attempt to bridge the gap between the natural factual environment and the idealistic, other and better world of the imagination. Human culture results from the enduring effort of man to create the world in the image of the preceding and prevailing images of the future. Culture is slowly advancing along the steep</page><page sequence="18">RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FUTURE AND THE FAR-AWAY 117 trail, split open by split man in his far-reaching visions of the future, wresting the world free from ils compelling and cramping present. d) The same causal process may be unchained in reverse, however. The disintegration of constructive images of the future, their weakening or even negativa I ion, the absence of equivalent, balanced, sublime forecasts to replace antiquated, worn-out or frustrated conceptions, may spell a period of cultural decline and breakdown. Of the thirty known civilizations in world-history, as, distinguished and described by Toynbee, only one, we are told, is now in existence and even that is threatened with the same extinction as the other twenty-nine. This last survivor in the gloomy graveyard of a cultural Stone-henge is our so called Western civilization. e) In this situation of pressing urgency two age-old questions again are forced to the surface of our con-science and confront the impassive science we have produced: What can we do—what must we do? (10) Social ethics a) Again and again we are thrown back to the same point of departure. Man, homo sapiens, can in his mind and imagination make another and, he hopes, better world than the existing one. This fact pre-supposes and implies manifold further developments. Its first presupposition is that of change, shift and transformation or recreation in the flow of time. Its second that there must be different possibilities or alternatives of change. Its third, the preconception of man's self-imposed task of selection of both the ends and means of desirable change. Its fourth the problem of the limits of human power, in the encounter with other forces, to control and direct this pre-selected change of the course of events. Its fifth a fundamental Weltanschauung of the time-flow itself: as an everreturning cycle, an upward spiral, a uni linear scheme, a broken but dialectically forward-moving line, and so on. These suppositions can be translated into the other, more</page><page sequence="19">118 FRED. L. POLAK complicated language of moral philosophy and ethics. If there are several, different and divergent possibilities for the future, the frightening freedom of choice looms. Not only of choice, but of responsible choice. Of choice between good and evil, between conflicting evils, and, as lo the good, between belter and best, enforcing each time anew a tenable definition of the "summum bonum", an acceptable hierarchy of values. The responsible choice pertaining to everything, to all commis sions and omissions, goes perpetually beyond I he evanescent moment of the choice itself (Gesinnungsethik) and is pro ducing its weighty consequences for the future (Erfolgsethik). Deeper still than this difficult choice bores Ihe question of "free will", Ihe search for a delineation between human and divine power, Ihe probing and pinning down of the boundaries to the relentless striving of sinful, ever-imperfect man on earth, and the repeated breakthrough of man's reason and purposeful activity past this receding fronlier. The preconceived border land between the intrepid techniques of man and the talents restricted by God is perpetually recast by the future. This also affects the underlying world-view and lime-philosophy. Social ethics has to make up its mind whether time can and must have a stop, and, if not, whither it should go; that is, how it could be controlled and to what intents and purposes. b) Every system of ethics is automatically directed towards the future. Its normative concepts for an ideal state (Seinsollen) are per definition opposed to Ihe present state of being (das Seiende). In contrast to the Is of this sad world of today it puts an Ought, which derives its criteria for judg ing actual behavior from a comparison with a non-existent and still fictitious future world. Its values, norms, ideals and ultimate ends try to elevate man from his present environ ment and make him outgrow himself in the approach to another, higher reality, such as could and should be remade —an imaginary state of perfection, harmony and holiness. c) However, as present reality undergoes revolutionary changes (largely owing, as we saw, to the work done by previous images of the future), so does the future itself. Images of the fulure always have to be re-evaluated to be adapted to the change of time, to be brought up to date. All</page><page sequence="20">RESPONSIBILITY FOR TIIE FUTURE AND THE FAR-AWAY 119 ethics refers to the future—but to which future? What is the meaning of our cultural heritage of values and ideals now, and, particularly, what is at present their suggestive mass appeal, their radiating and expansive force in shaping this very future? Social ethics can be atrophied or revitalizing. Tt mainly depends on whether its image of the future is by now a skeleton, bleached by time, another marble monument in the mausoleum of dead cultures, or whether it is a living force, able by a vigorous regeneration to impres its distinct mark on the future of human society. Here social ethics might well ask for and accept all pos sible help from the social sciences. Here the social sciences, in their turn, should leave their ivory-tower-position of dis passionate spectatorship, where they have isolated themselves from the dangerous field of values and value-judgments. It is their own fate as well, which is at stake. And whether I hey abstain or participate, social scientists are in part responsible for failure or success in the continuing process of clarification and adaptation of the images of the future, and of their under lying belief-systems, their changing trends of direction, their shifting balance of forces and counter-forces. From a pene trating and purposeful analysis of this process, social ethics should take its cue for restating its position towards the future which is rushing towards us. Social ethics, born out of the compulsion of free choice, now has to choese for itself between the extremes of mere existence and pure essence. It might be carried off by the stream of presently fashionable pessimism and negativism, denying the reality of a coming other and belter world and stamping this as a dangerous delusion of our naive prede cessors. To avoid this it must strive hard for a positive re orientation and revaluation, explicitly redefining the new goals for future life, so they can be understood and perhaps even acclaimed by this realistic and sceptical generation. The main responsibility of social ethics is now, as always, to assess and pass on to coming generations our responsibility for the future. This implies, above all, the ability and willingness to contribute to a responsible choice between potential futures</page><page sequence="21">120 FRED. L. POLAK und ulternalive systems of values. Not all images of the future, not even the positive and optimistic ones, are auto matically to be considered as good images of the future. For example, Rosenberg's Der Mythus des zwanzigsten Jahr hunderts will be rejected flatly by most of contemporary social ethics. There are, however, others on which a responsible position must be taken; if necessary, a clear yes or no must be openly given. Social ethics can no longer pretend to remain neutral and aloof. II. The red thread weaving through the entire course of this argument, is that all responsibility, including our responsi bility in and for the present, cannot but be incorporated in a wider framework of responsibility for the future. At least if it is to be a living, progressive and purposive responsibility. The terms "farsighted" and "responsible" are, of course, not identical, but they condition and complement each other. Responsibility without foresight is blind, foresight without responsibility is void. Responsibility without foresight is not only blind, it may even defy its own ends and result in its own distortion and destruction. The future is always there and we cannot simply forget all about it and lose ourselves completely in the present. It is impossible to leave an open space for the future, because in culture the abhorrence of the vacuum is as strong as in nature. It is either we ourselves who consciously try to make the future, or others who are sure to make the future, both theirs and ours. It is not a choice between having or not having any images of the future, but between the good images, worth living and dying for, and the bad images, which we cannot accept without betraying ourselves. A choice between the continuous capacity to devise our own preferred projec tions of the Promised Land, and the passive choiceless accep tance of a ready-made future, fabricated elsewhere with alien motives and violating and outmoding our most valued ideals. We may well be approaching, and rapidly, some such awkward situation as this. Let us try to determine our current position, to find true North and to measure the velocity of the</page><page sequence="22">RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FUTURE AND THE FAR-AWAY 121 drift. We may use the image of the future as a fairly reliable criterion of primary driving forces; its strength or weakness indicates I heir direction and regulative power. There are, at present, three main fields for such obser vations and calculations. 1. That part of the world, Western Europe, which, thanks to its sweeping succession of exalted images of the future, has held the key to human civilization for a few thousand years, now seems rather exhausted. There are still reverberations from the old enthusiastic idealism, but they grow fainter and fainter. There are attempts at revival, occasional flashes and flare-ups, sparks striking from the still smouldering fire. On the whole, however, the former potent images of the future (both eschatological and Utopian) are mostly in their death throes or already buried, without effec tive recharging of these indispensable generators of culture having taken place. At best they are fading and shriveling without much ado. On the contrary, there is now a marked tendency to deride and defame these spiritual fathers of our own time; there is a strong distaste for and repulsion of all idealistic and optimistic thought concerning another and better world. The inverse idea, that we are thrown into the worst of all possible worlds, a world which cannot be fundamentally changed, is making impressive headway on a broad front. This idea leaves no hopeful prospect in lime for mankind on earth. 2. In Ihe transoceanic part of the world, the U. S. A., largely built up from the same European sources of manpower and mentality, there was at first an astounding upswing and far-reaching renascence of images of the future among a genuinely excited people. As once the Netherlands and their empire were literally torn away from the sea and elevated to a Golden Age, so now again step by step the New World was erected right through rocky mountain ranges, barren wilder ness and arid deserts, unwaveringly following the beaming and beckoning lodestar of the American Dream towards a wildly fantastic and yet factually foreseeable future. But this, too, has by now become past history. This is</page><page sequence="23">122 FRED. L. POLAK surely nol Ihe place to weigh the value and validity of the American Dream in the America of today and tomorrow. Still, the outcome of such enquiry will be of all-pervading influence for the future, also outside America. Has the American Dream retained its old intensity and appeal? Is it weakened and losing out to Ihe world-conquering forces of pessimism, anxiety and, indeed, fatalism, which have even penetrated into the lion's den of American optimism? Or has it only shifted its base, altered its objective, and changed its garments ? 3. Finally, in almost all other parts of the world—behind the Iron Curtain (including peoples formerly included in the West-European orbit), and both Asia and Africa—whether we like it or not at all—there is unquestionably at work a churning upheaval of mass-appealing images of the future. These are already changing the face of whole continents, per haps of the whole world. The guiding principles and normative values of these images may not be ours; they may even be diametrically opposed to our cherished views, mutually exclusive. If so, there is but one response to this challenge: to have the better, clearer and stronger, above all, more aspiring and inspiring images of the future. In my conviction the decisive struggle in this ideological combat will not, be fought on the military battlefields. The crucial and conclusive battle will take place where the struggle began when man first started to split reality and time, in the minds of men. It will be won, in the end, by those peoples, who have at their command the most highly charged potential of powerful and persistent images of the future. Those images of the future are bound to triumph which most con vincingly reach out towards the greatest vistas and most superior perspectives for human society or mankind as a whole. If, in our present society there would no longer be a place for philosophers and dreamers, for prophets and poets, for Utopian idealists, progressive thinkers and visionary humanists —and a prominent place at that!—then we risk and also deserve to be swept away by the blazing force of other cul tures, actuated into turbulent motion by new images of the</page><page sequence="24">RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FUTURE AND TIIE FAR-AWAY 123 future, possessing and obsessing peoples all over the earth. If this happens, we will have no right lo complain of our miserable fale, for we will have deliberately repudiated or at least guiltily neglected our self-imposed function of respon sible stewardship for the future and the far-away. That is the high function inherent in the dignity of man: to master, as far as humanly possible, our own individual and collective destiny. If, in our lime, we no longer feel responsible for under taking the creative splitting from reality of a coming, other and better lime—if we increasingly abhor the products of such a split as false illusions or delusions of grandeur, if we try to escape this inescapable responsibility by pretending this is none of our business—then we have already regressed a long way. If the cause of "Fernstenliebe" (the love of far away) no longer rouses us, the cause of "Nächstenliebe" (love of the neighbor) would look thin indeed. For these two stand and fall together. If the Kingdom of Heaven is no longer going to descend on earth, only narrowly materialistic or nationalistic expectations remain, and their life is temporary at best. If, finally, we only want an increasing mastery of the forces of nature, but not of time in the long view, nature and time in monstruous association will unite against man and his shortsighted civilization. If the pursuit of happiness is self-centeredly focussed on todays problems, profits and pleasures (carpe diem), then, one day, the reckless evocation of "après nous le déluge" may become a bitter reality for the descendents we have repudiated by default. Then creative faith in the future may gradually, but completely be super seded by an impotent fear of the future, leaving man an easy prey for a coming onslaught of apocalyptic catastrophe. The above speculations are all cast in the hypothetical form: if—then. They are not meant at all to be pessimistic, and even less despairing. They are intended as a signal to draw attention to the sharp cleavage characteristic of the spirit of our time. The split, now, is no longer between this and another, better society, but between the socalled idealists, looking ahead, and the socalled realists, loking around. Both sides, of course, plead a ponderous sense of responsibility.</page><page sequence="25">124 FRED. L. POLAK The idealists say no to the present and yes to their chosen future. The realists say yes to the present and are not on speaking terms with the future. Each thinks of the other as rather irresponsible. The protagonists of the here-and-now seem to be gaining ground. Their eventual success might lead to a Pyrrhic victory. Because, if I may repeal, the final triumph will go to those peoples-of-two-worlds, who in deepest darkness keep their eyes on the radiant light of the City of Tomorrow. It will go to those who struggle along to the last breath in search of the Promised Land where their children's children may dwell in peace and happiness, at the glorious end of man's painful pilgrimage.
