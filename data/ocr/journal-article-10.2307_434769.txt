RICHMOND HERE is an increasing tendency in modern criticism to question the accuracy, and even the validity, of the idea of a seventeenth-century school of metaphysical poets participating in the creation of a specific kind of verse under the general presidency of John Donne.' This decline in support for the clear-cut pattern visualized, during the first decades of the present century, by the critics and editors of the Stuart lyric poets makes it worthwhile trying to establish what justifications remain for the continued use of the term "metaphysical" in talking of seventeenth-century verse. To focus this analysis, I propose to examine one of the most bizarre of "stock" lyric themes in the Renaissance-that of the unknown, or unknowable, mistress. The advantages of this line of study lie in the severe challenge such a strange topic imposes on the poet, which makes it a useful catalyst of styles and methods of com- position. A poet may hardly treat this topic casually-granted its existence and poetic interest, some kind of "solution" to the problem it poses has to be found, and in the finding of it we shall see dis- played the psychological and technical resources of Caroline poetry and of the "metaphysical" style in particular. Just where in the complex pattern of lyric traditions the theme found its origins is not relevant to our purposes, which are served satisfactorily by a starting point safely before the peak of English Renaissance lyricism, in the works of Ron- sard. The French poet had composed a curious madrigal, beginning: L'homme est bien sot, qui aime sans co- gnoistre. J'aime, et jamais je ne vy ce que j'aime: D'un faux penser je me degoy moy-mesme, Je suis esclave, et ne cognois mon maistre. L'imaginer seulement me fait estre Comme je suis en une peine extreme. L'ceil peut faillir, l'aureille fait de mesme Mais nul des sens mon amour n'a fait naistre. 2 One senses the attempt at a lyrical tour de force. The orthodox praises of some idealized beauty are no longer demanding enough to tempt the progressive poet, and the classic pattern of such a poem as "Mignonne allons voir si la rose ..." is ' E.g., L.

RICHMOND being discarded for the exotic effects which alone can tempt a palate jaded by the multiplication of neoclassical verses. The poem might be considered as exploring specifically the frustrating evanescence of some idealized, sexual wish-fulfilment, but its potentialities lie in the essentially in- trospective approach of the poet. Love is seen here as something divorced from a specific sensuous experience, and, though this poem describes a special situation and its significance is not objectified by Ronsard, we have here an important re- setting of the scene of love's dramas. No longer are these necessarily unfolded in an externalized exchange with the mis- tress, in which her physical attributes are a primary, even unique, issue. Ron- sard's poem establishes the mind as love's new sphere and claims that the mental orientation of the lover has an intrinsic importance which the poet can explore with advantage, to the originality of his verses at least. In terms of this approach to love, the figure of the mistress is bound to be further subordinated to the role of her admirer. Previously, though pos- session of her charms had usually been sought egotistically by the lover-to as- suage his own desire-the appreciation of those charms had played a flattering part in the relation. Now, however, the luxurious subject or source of the lover's desire is to be replaced by the interest of the lover's desire itself, whose auton- omy from specific attractions Ronsard's madrigal bizarrely illustrates. The sub- jectivity of the amorous verse of Caroline poets and the anonymity, or tenuous char- acter, of the mistresses involved, in such poems as Marvell's "To His Coy Mis- tress," find some explanation in this new orientation. When we say such poets lack concern for their ladies, we should realize that this is because they have been se- duced by the exotically intellectual de- lights of introspection and self-deploy- ment. And when we call a poem like "Aire and Angels" frigid, we should realize that the focus is no longer on evoking a situa- tion but on the analysis of an attitude. Such introspection and analysis turn nat- urally to reason and to logic for assis- tance. The reaction of the two most self- conscious lyric craftsmen in English during the early years of the new century- Jonson and Donne-to the kind of effect found in Ronsard's poem is significant and characteristic. In a sense, Jonson sim- ply does not treat the theme at all in any of his lyrics, but one of them, "The Dreame," affords a useful parallel de- fining how Jonson's conservative spirit dealt with the bizarre: Or Scorn, or pittie on me take, I must the true Relation make, I am undone to night; Love in a subtile Dreame disguis'd, Hath both my heart and me surpriz'd, Whom never yet he durst attempt awake; Nor will he tell me for whose sake He did me the Delight, Or Spight, But leaves me to inquire, In all my wild desire, Of sleepe againe, who was his Aid; And sleepe so guiltie and afraid, As since he dares not come within my sight.3 Apparently, this is just an ingenious var- iant on the ancient dream-poem tradition -but closer examination will show that it does share with Ronsard's poem a mis- tress, not only unidentified but unidenti- fiable. However, in contrast to Ronsard's wilful eccentricity, we can see how dex- trously the bizarre idea of this unknown mistress is normalized-accommodated to the reader's good sense. What might have seemed strange becomes merely quaint. 3 Ben Jonson, ed. C. H. Herford et al. (Oxford' 1947), VIII, 150.</page><page sequence="3">THE INTANGIBLE MISTRESS 219 Jonson's lyric art is in general that of skilful acclimatization of the classical or the exotic to the more subdued, even homely, English lyric tradition-we may recall, for example, the engaging compu- tation of Catullus' kisses by "the grasse of Rumney," "the sands of Chelsey," and "the drops in silver Thames."4 The decorum of "The Dreame" equally marks the achievement of Jonson, which, in turn, much more than Donne's virtuosity, pre- pares the way for Herbert's measured delicacy. Ronsard's exotic deviations into fancifulness are barely paralleled by the quaintly paradoxical, but perfectly ra- tional, situation of Jonson's lover. By no stretch of the imagination could "The Dreame" be called "metaphysical," though it is entirely "reasonable." Donne was a sufficiently assiduous reader of Ronsard to share several effects with him, mostly rather dramatic ones like the opening of the sonnet "Batter my heart, three person'd God;..." It is not surprising, therefore, that Donne's use of the "intangible mistress" as a theme in "Negative Love" is quite different from Jonson's and offers Ronsard's idea not made normal but merely made discon- certingly logical: I never stoop'd so low, as they Which on an eye, cheeke, lip, can prey,... My love, though silly, is more brave, For may I misse, when ere I crave, If I know yet, what I would have. If that be simply perfectest Which can by no way be exprest But Negatives, my love is so.5 Pursuing the vein of the ironic, lawyer- like pleas of the Italian capitoli, Donne "explains" his attitude but hardly justi- fies it, as the rather barren conclusion displays: As yet my ease, and comfort is, Though I speed not, I cannot misse. Just how seriously Donne intends this curious poem is hard to say, but he makes little effort toward the Jonsonian ideal of "normalizing" the situation. Unlike Ronsard, he does not even admit the folly of his point of view, but, though this characteristic wilfulness (and even latent insincerity) is one of the most un- rewarding aspects of Donne's writing, nev- ertheless it does advance the point of view taken by the "speaker" to a position of potential rationality at least, without avoiding the challenge through such "ex- planations" as Jonson invokes. The really interesting point is, however, that the processes which Donne invokes are "met- aphysical" in the strictest sense. For the Renaissance lover no less than for the theologian of the time, the pursuit and definition of the ideal, whether sacred or profane, could proceed only by means of the sole systematic resources available -the intellectual processes of the medi- eval scholastic thinkers. Now this observa- tion is hardly original-many critics have distinguished the delight that Donne takes in deifying his mistress and making reli- gion a love affair-but the usual view taken of the process is that this displays primarily the originality, the stimulating unexpectedness, of Donne's mind. No fur- ther definable value has been attached to his work except for that dubious "fu- sion" of thought and feeling which the unresolved attitude of the poet in "Nega- tive Love" apparently negates. But there is another less esoteric and much more important value in such poetry of Donne as this. The intention of Donne, no less than of Ronsard, is the renovation of exhausted lyricism by fantasy-but for the latent theologian in Donne the rig- orous techniques of medieval dialectic had an almost morbid fascination which trans- formed Ronsard's eccentricities into the SIn "Kiss me, sweet; ... ," ibid., VIII, 103. 6 Poems, ed.

The importance of such a poem is not that it links God and mistress (Donne never wholly avoids an ironic overtone anyway) but that profane love is enriched in its expression and its anal- ysis with all those delicate discriminations and that rigorous sense of logical sequence that hitherto men had felt worthy only of their religious preoccupations. The cru- cial interest in "Negative Love" is not in "feeling" but in "thinking." The poem is only very remotely to be considered a "lover's" poem; much more reasonably it might be considered an expression of an experimental persona. It presents not a new way of feeling about love but a new way of defining it. "How far," Donne seems to be asking, insofar as the poem is serious, "is it useful to consider that the relations between lover and mistress have the uniqueness and immateriality which theologians have also found appro- priate to man's relation to God?" The implication is that man's approach to God is spiritual, and his approach to a mistress is no less so. Just as a heaven of precious stones and anthropomorphic images proved trivial and inadequate for Christian thought, so the man who thinks of love as a flashing eye, a delicate com- plexion, and other more intimate speci- fications on the sensual plane is blinding himself to the essence of love, which tran- scends the specific and the specifiable and becomes an orientation of minds, a spirit- ual tension, which thus, almost by defini- tion, will lend itself to exposition, without metaphor, by scholastic concepts. As long as critics attempt to suggest that Donne illustrates a special way of feeling, they will be reduced to what Mr. Leonard Unger calls "the snarls of amateur psy- chologising."6 In the realm of ratiocina- tion about love, by contrast, we can ana- lyze accurately the new elements which Donne contributes to the psychology of love. It is significant that the Caroline poets who succeeded him imitated, not the eerie phosphorescent gleams of feeling that hang around the decaying conven- tions which Donne exploited, but his tech- nique of rigorously analytic scrutiny of such a given "dramatic" situation. Nevertheless, many poets loosely called "metaphysical" do not fall into the ex- actly delimited category with which I am concerned. "To His Coy Mistress" for ex- ample, is not a truly metaphysical poem. From this point of view, there is indeed some progression from the advance illus- trated in "Negative Love," for the power to reason in verse has been very discretely assimilated, but the famous ratiocinative sequence of the thought is actually more conspicuous by its subdued nature than by its prominence, in comparison with the work of Marvell's contemporaries and predecessors. Compare the skeletal and auxiliary nature of the argument in Mar- vell's poem with the primary role it plays in Carew's very much weaker "Perswa- sions To Enjoy"' (also taken from Ron- sard incidentally). Marvell's poem is real- ly distinguished by its brilliant craftsman- ship-in a sense it looks forward to such a poem as Gray's "Elegy in a Country Churchyard," which is an equally skilful, but less vivacious, recapitulation and fu- sion of established techniques and points of style. Eliot's famous description of Mar- vell's "urbanity" reads extraordinarily like a description, by an eighteenth-century author, of "good taste." "To His Coy Mistress" is more sonorous and elegant than provocative and deep-searching. It is significant that increasingly it is coming S Unger, p. 106. 7 "If the quick spirits ... ," Poems, ed. R. Dunlap (Oxford, 1957), p. 16.</page><page sequence="5">THE INTANGIBLE MISTRESS 221 to take its place with the "Elegy" as an automatic, popular anthology choice. We must look elsewhere for explora- tory lyricism following Donne's lead. Per- haps the most striking Caroline example of the "unknowable mistress" theme is Cleveland's "Hecatomb to His Mistress." This is modeled basically on Donne's "Negative Love" but is a very different work. The relation between the two poems is that between ingenious innovation and systematic exploitation. A bizarre but striking adventure in the lyric becomes a full-blown heroic excursion in the rhap- sody. Cleveland, despite the comparative neglect of his work, is a true poet, in that his style is richly metaphorical and lively, but, like all baroque artists, he also has a strong sense of architectural massing. He projects the sketched outlines of Donne's poem into bold, full sweeps. The victims of Donne's mockery, lovers who "stoop so low" as to praise their mistresses' bodies and other merely cus- tomary attributes, are now wholly routed by hyperbolic parody; but at the heart of the rejection of these mundane conven- tionalities lies the same train of thought as that which Donne pursued. However, Cleveland is not content with the merely bizarre effects of Donne. He feels the obligation to proceed further-from logic to reason, from metaphor to simile, from experimental persona to serious exposi- tion. The following passage, for example, would serve perfectly as a sober footnote to the corresponding one in Donne's poem: As then, a purer substance is defined But by a heap of negatives combined, Ask what a spirit is, you'll hear them cry It hath no matter, no mortality: So can I not define how sweet, how fair: Only I say she's not as others are. For what perfections we to others grant, It is her sole perfection to want.8 This is certainly dilute Donne, but where Donne is strange, Cleveland is lucid, and, by his dramatic exposition of the lover's thought processes, he makes these seem, if not so decorous, at least as probable, as Jonson's approach would permit. The single line, "Only I say she's not as oth- ers are," resolves the strain of the al- lusion to theology by offering a modu- lating term between the lover's intoxi- cation and the non-human concepts of metaphysics. Cleveland states explicitly, what was latent in "Negative Love," that the terms of comparison customarily in- voked by the lover praising his mistress are wrong. Just as theology must reject crude material parallelisms in stressing the uniqueness of its themes, so the lover cannot find any alternatives to express that unique relation between his mistress and himself which governs his apprecia- tion of her charms. The "Hecatomb" is thus among the earliest explicit and sys- tematic rejections, in terms drafted by Donne, of any crudely sensory definition of sexual love. The most important dif- ference from our point of view between "Negative Love" and the "Hecatomb" is that the first by almost no consideration can be described as a love poem, while Cleveland's poem ostensibly is-it keeps carefully within the bounds of an actuality in which the "she" is emphatically ex- istent. The novelty of this vision of the "in- tangible mistress" theme is illustrated by Waller's approach to it, in a poem pub- lished only two years before Cleveland's "Hecatomb." Waller's "On the Discovery of a Lady's Painting" is a more trivial, less delicately executed version of Jonson's technique of accommodating a ridiculous situation to the terms of ordinary life. a G. Saintsbury (ed.), Minor Poets of the Caroline Period (Oxford, 1921), p. 22.</page><page sequence="6">222 H. M. RICHMOND Waller explains that he has discovered his mistress' charms to be synthetic-- merely the artistic product of cosmetics, but: though the beauty do appear No beauty, which amazed me so; Yet from my breast I cannot tear The passion which from thence did grow;... I dote on that which is nowhere; The sign of beauty feeds my fire.... This poem shares with Jonson's a more limited intention than those of Donne and Cleveland-the pursuit of elegant quaintness, of curious but disciplined par- adox. There is, in fact, a strongly sus- tained stream of such ingeniously arti- ficial poems in the earlier seventeenth century which would form a more compact and uniform group for study than the old "metaphysical" sequence. Prettily con- ceited verse dealing with quaint situations is particularly a Caroline specialty. To this vein many of the poems of George Herbert, for example, could be more read- ily assimilated than to that of Donne's verse, to the stringent scholasticism of which they offer no parallel. That is why Herbert, writing on religious themes, nev- ertheless gives the reader a more secular sense of delight than is produced by the intense scrutiny to which Donne subjects even pagan themes. On the other hand, the cult of paradox, loosely associated with "metaphysical" poetry in the old sense, is now proved to be an attribute of "Cavalier" lyricism, again clearly an inadequate conception. However, Waller's poem, like Herbert's poetry, does avoid scholastic techniques of analysis. The apparent divorce between the rig- orous intellectuality of the poets for whom I have justified the title "metaphysical" and the charming effects of their more aesthetically self-conscious rivals is not a very significant one. Few poets can be as neatly classified as the few poems which I have examined. In fact, it is in such fusions as these unclassifiable poets produce that there appears the most fruit- ful development of that new analytic, pri- marily psychological, view of love which I have sketched. This graceful union of intellect and form is the major achieve- ment of Caroline verse. We see such activity in action in a poem of Suckling which resolves the enigma of the "in- tangible mistress" conclusively. The atti- tude of Ronsard and Donne is expressed in terms dramatically convincing, but com- pletely in harmony with the bizarre as- pirations of the two poets. The scholastic machinery has been abandoned, and we are left with the unsophisticated truth about a lover's mental posture. The poem is addressed to Cupid: Of thee, kind boy, I ask no red and white, To make up my delight; No odd becoming graces, Black eyes, or little know-not-whats, in faces; Make me but mad enough, give me good store Of love for her I court: I ask no more, 'Tis love in love that makes the sport....1 Clearly, Suckling has mastered the irrele- vance of the usual "specifications" such as those of the naive, if charming, "Wishes to His Supposed Mistress" of Crashaw. No aspiring lover should be so vulgar as to imagine that the definition of the ideal mistress is a question of material or sensuous attributes. "Blond or brunette?" is, strictly speaking, now an anachro- nism (though both Ovid and Lucretius had long ago hinted at this). The fas- cination of the mistress will find itself determined exclusively by the lover's state of mind. SPoems, ed. G. Thorn Drury (London, 1905), I, 99. 1o R. G.

It is the emphatic registering of this new sphere for love's activities which Donne's strictly metaphysical love poems herald, often obscurely and grotesquely. "Aire and An- gels" and "The Extasie" have in common a primary concern with the mental rela- tion of lovers in which the body is at worst a confusing element of the relation and at best a humble servant of the spiritual. If "feeling" and metaphor are kept out of the discussion, it is clear that this application of metaphysics to appropriate secular phenomena still justi- fies the adjective "metaphysical" in re- lation to Donne's verse. Once the primary interest of the mental pattern of love was recognized, the rather stiff mechanism of philosophy and theology was increas- ingly discarded, but the scope of the anal- ysis remained Donnesque if the terminolo- gy ceased to be so. It is by their explora- tion of this new territory with the aid of their analytic powers, but also without abandoning the wit and elegance of the more suave poems which we have dis- cussed, that the Caroline poets as a group made their permanent and classic con- tribution to the literature of love.
