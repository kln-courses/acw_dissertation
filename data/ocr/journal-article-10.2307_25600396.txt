<plain_text><page sequence="1">THOMAS McFARLAND Wordsworth on Man, on Nature, and on Human Life Wn Man, on Nature, and on Human Life." The triple phrase is \^t familiar to us all as the theme of Wordsworth's vast projected poem "The Recluse." It is also, as I shall suggest in this essay, a statement that in its idiosyncrasy becomes a key to unlock much of Wordsworth's secret poetic heart, or to use an idiom more in vogue, a statement that invites us irresistibly to deconstruct its meaning and context. The simple Wordsworth, to cite John Danby's rubric borrowed from Byron, hardly conforms in our own time to any careful reader's con ception of Wordsworth and his achievement. Instead, beginning perhaps with David Ferry's book of 1959 and Geoffrey Hartman's volume of 1964, and deepened by Richard Onorato's psychoanalytical study of The Prelude in 1971, the current trend in reading Wordsworth is to see less the healing poet hailed by Mill and Arnold, although Wordsworth is of course still and always that, than to see rather a poet whose serenity was won at much cost, whose poetic surfaces overlay depths of contra diction and turbulence, whose peaks of achievement are not patiently built by pyramidal architecture, but are rather the upthrustings of a mountain range formed by vast subliminal masses and forces moving against one another. The great "Immortality" ode, for instance, generates its power by a logical argument that moves in one direction, and an emotional current that moves directly against that argument, to result in a poem of enor mous tension and power, but also in one that exhibits a disrupted surface replete with contradiction and littered statement. It is perhaps well to remember that I am not alone in my apprehension of the poem's littered surface. Different critics, in different terminologies and different per spectives, have repeatedly been bothered by roughness and inconsis tency. Thus Arnold observes restively that the Ode is "not wholly free from something declamatory." A. C. Bradley notes of Wordsworth that "where his metrical form is irregular his ear is uncertain. The "Immor tality" ode, like King Lear, is its author's greatest product, but not his best piece of work." Still again, Trilling comments that "the Ode is not SiR, 21 (Winter 1982) 601</page><page sequence="2">602 THOMAS McFARLAND wholly perspicuous. . . . The difficulty does not lie in the diction, which is simple, or even in the syntax, which is sometimes obscure, but rather in certain contradictory statements which the poem makes, and in the ambiguity of some of its crucial words." Fiercer critics speak more fiercely. "Ode: Intimations of Immortality is loosely associational in method," says Yvor Winters contemptuously, "Wordsworth gives us bad oratory about his own clumsy emotions and a landscape that he has never really perceived." Leavis, again, charges the poem with "empty grandiosity" and "general factitiousness," with "falsity" and "rhythmic vulgarity." More specific is Coleridge's comment on the lines in stanza 8, "Thou, over whom thy Immortality / Broods like the Day, a Master o'er a Slave," where he says that "without examining the propriety of making a 'master brood o'er a slave,' or the day brood at all; we will merely ask, what does all this mean?" We might also, a fortiori, resort to Coleridge's question when we confront the final lines of the poem, for there the emotion floods to a climax while the logical progression breaks down completely: Another race hath been, and other palms are won. Thanks to the human heart by which we live, Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears, To me the meanest flower that blows can give Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears. We feel the emotional intensity of the lines and by that token accept their meaning, but such meaning hardly inheres in the logic. What is the other race? For that matter, what is the first one? Vaguely we feel the lines have something to do with the course of human life, but the metaphor of race and palms is not legitimized by anything developed by the poem. Likewise, the "Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears" in their implication cancel the possibility of the ode. Still again, to say, as Wordsworth does earlier in the last stanza, that "I love the Brooks which down their channels fret, / Even more than when I tripped lightly as they," is hardly possible in terms of the profound and repeated statements of loss at the beginning ofthe poem. The turning point in the ode, where emotion begins to swamp logic, is stanza 9, which begins this way: O joy! that in our embers Is something that doth live, That nature yet remembers What was so fugitive! The thought of our past years in me doth breed Perpetual benediction:</page><page sequence="3">WORDSWORTH ON MAN, NATURE, AND HUMAN LIFE 603 The invocation of joy is here a wondrous exercise of the Freudian mechanism of denial. To find the flame of life replaced by embers calls for gloom, not joy; the logic demands something like "Oh woe, that all my burning life is now reduced to embers." The poem has moved bleakly enough from the joyous idea that "Heaven lies about us in our infancy" to the gloomy idea that "Shades of the prison-house begin to close / Upon the growing Boy" and to the eventual desolate knowledge that in adulthood the heavenly radiance dies away and fades into the light of common day. The logical burden of the argument, therefore, is depression at this loss of being, at the haunted sense that "The things which I have seen I now can see no more," at the certain knowledge "That there hath past away a glory from the earth." It is only the emotional determination to "grieve not" that opens the floodgates for the philosophy of joy. If the power of the "Immortality" ode is generated amidst contradic tion and even incoherence, other kinds of anomalies inhere in the origin and circumstances of The Prelude. As I have elsewhere pointed out, the greatest poem of the nineteenth century does not even have a text, for its substance hovers in Hegelian Aufhebung somewhere between the facing page editions of the 1805 and 1850 versions. Actually, The Prelude could as well be printed in, as it were, a Septuagint edition as one on facing pages, for it existed successively in two books, five books, thir teen books, and fourteen books. Indeed, the scholars who labor at Dove Cottage now discern even more versions; Jonathan Wordsworth, not entirely facetiously, delivered a lecture at Grasmere in 1978 entitled "Seventeen Versions of The Prelude." Allied to this indeterminacy in its text is the uncertainty of the poem's genesis and purpose. After being worked on for almost fifty years, it was not even published by its author, nor was it named The Prelude by him. It was not in fact originally designed as a prelude, but rather as what Dorothy termed an "appendix" and what Coleridge called "a tail-piece" to "The Recluse." Furthermore, its very aspiration to trace the growth of the poet's mind is in direct conflict with Wordsworth's apotheosis of childhood, for he believed that children need no growth, that they are "blest, and powerful," that they already possess "those truths" that "we are toiling all our lives to find." The idea of development or growth is in this insistent context an anom aly. Of the Cottage-boy in Book Three of The Excursion, the Solitary comments that "Far happiest . . . / If, such as now he is, he might remain." That, one surmises, was Wordsworth's true and constant feel ing about growth, and it seems quite fitting that the first two books of The Prelude, which are about his infancy and early childhood, also contain its greatest poetry.</page><page sequence="4">604 THOMAS McFARLAND If we find conflict and turbulence in the multiple statement of The Prelude and its environs as well as in the articulations of a single statement like the "Immortality" ode, it may scarcely come as a surprise to find in the triple phrase "On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life" a doorway not to clear simplicity but to turbulent complexity. The triple phrase purports to be a beginning, a beginning indeed to the greatest effort of Wordsworth's poetic genius. But the poem to which it was designed as a beginning never came into existence, and thereby Words worth is forced to cast "On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life" as the beginning to a mere advertisement for that envisioned poem, or in his own words, as a "kind of Prospectus of the design and scope of the whole Poem." As such, it is prefixed to the publication of The Excursion in 1814, and of The Excursion itself Wordsworth says that "this is only a portion of a poem; and the Reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious Work which is to consist of three parts." "The poem of which The Excursion is a part," he goes on to say, has the "Title of The Recluse" So the "Prospectus" is set at the beginning of the second part of "The Recluse," and the triple phrase "On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life" is set at the beginning of the "Prospectus." But here, too, the condition of beginning is compro mised, for the opening line of the "Prospectus" is actually line 754 of the unpublished "Home at Grasmere," which was to constitute Part One of Book One of "The Recluse," and the 107 lines ofthe "Prospectus" are actually the last 107 lines of "Home at Grasmere." Beginnings continue to disintegrate as we inspect the actual texture ofthe "Prospectus." In setting out with the prepositional phrases "On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life" Wordsworth clearly invites com parison with the prepositional grandeur ofthe beginning ofParadise Lost: 'Of man's first disobedience," and so forth. Wordsworth's statement indeed proceeds in Miltonic cadences and even in Miltonic wordings into Miltonic paragraphs: 'On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life, Musing in solitude, I oft perceive Fair trains of imagery before me rise, Accompanied by feelings of delight Pure, or with no unpleasing sadness mixed; And I am conscious of affecting thoughts And dear remembrances, whose presence soothes Or elevates the Mind, intent to weigh The good and evil of our mortal state. ?To these emotions, whencesoe'er they come,</page><page sequence="5">WORDSWORTH ON MAN, NATURE, AND HUMAN LIFE 605 Whether from breath of outward circumstance, Or from the Soul?an impulse to herself? I would give utterance in numerous verse. Of Truth, of Grandeur, Beauty, Love, and Hope, And melancholy Fear subdued by Faith; Of blessed consolations in distress; Of moral strength, and intellectual Power; Of joy in widest commonalty spread; Of the individual Mind that keeps her own Inviolate retirement, subject there To Conscience only, and the law supreme Of that Intelligence which governs all? I sing:?"fit audience let me find though few!" 4So prayed, more gaining than he asked, the Bard? In holiest mood. Urania, I shall need Thy guidance, or a greater Muse, if such Descend to earth or dwell in highest heaven! For I must tread on shadowy ground, must sink Deep?and, aloft ascending, breathe in worlds To which the heaven of heavens is but a veil. All strength?all terror, single or in bands, That ever was put forth in personal form? Jehovah?with his thunder, and the choir Of shouting Angels, and the empyreal thrones? I pass them unalarmed.

My haunt, and the main region of my song. I have quoted the opening statements?some 41 lines?at such length in order to be able to point out how turbulent and littered they are. The anxiety of the Miltonic precursorship is everywhere apparent. What does a poem by William Wordsworth legitimately have to do with shouting Angels and empyreal thrones, not to speak of the darkest pit of lowest Erebus? The answer is of course nothing; such figments are invoked out of the anxiety of setting forth upon an epic beginning under the awesome historical eye of Paradise Lost. Other indications of Words worth's anxiety are his actually taking over phrases from his predecessor; his "numerous verse" of line 13 is from Book Five of Paradise Lost</page><page sequence="6">606 THOMAS McFARLAND (1. 150), the "empyreal thrones" of line 34 are from Book Two of Paradise Lost (1. 430), and his "fit audience let me find though few" of line 23 is of course from Book Seven of Paradise Lost (11. 30-31), as is the Urania of two lines farther down. If alien epic invocations under the eye of Milton disrupt the tone of beginning, another kind of anxiety fractures its logic. For it is not only the epic grandeur of Milton that weighs upon Wordsworth's poetic entrance arch; that entrance is also burdened by the philosophical insis tences of Coleridge, who in fact has been anxiously invoked in Words worth's preface to The Excursion as the driving force in the conception of a philosophical poem, specifically of a philosophical poem "On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life," or as Wordsworth says in the preface, "Man, Nature, and Society": Several years ago, when the Author retired to his native mountains, with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary Work that might live, it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind, and examine how far Nature and Education had qualified him for such employment. As subsidiary to this prepara tion, he undertook to record, in verse, the origin and progress of his own powers, as far as he was acquainted with them. That Work, addressed to a dear Friend, most distinguished for his knowledge and genius, and to whom the Author's Intellect is deeply indebted, has been long finished; and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem, containing views of Man, Nature and Society; and to be entitled, The Recluse. . . . The phrase "a philosophical poem" points to Coleridge, for the situation with regard to Wordsworth, in W. W. Robson's succinct formulation, was that "meditative as he was, his mind was radically unphilosophical." It was Coleridge, not Wordsworth, who thought that Wordsworth should write a philosophical poem. Coleridge's proselytizing was re peated and insistent. Thus of a portrait of Wordsworth done by Hazlitt, Coleridge comments: Sir G[eorge] Beaumont &amp; his wife both say, that the Picture gives them an idea of you as a profound strong-minded Philosopher, not as a Poet?I answered (&amp; I believe, truly?) that so it must needs do, if it were a good Portrait?for that you were a great Poet by inspirations, &amp; in the Moments of revelation, but that you were a thinking feeling Philosopher habitually?that your Poetry was your Philosophy under the action of strong winds of Feeling?a sea rolling high.?</page><page sequence="7">WORDSWORTH ON MAN, NATURE, AND HUMAN LIFE 607 Again, he says that Wordsworth is "the first &amp; greatest philosophical Poet?the only man who has effected a compleat and constant synthesis of Thought &amp; Feeling and combined them with Poetic Forms." Cole ridge accordingly wrote that he "looked forward to the Recluse, as the first and only true Philosophical] Poem in existence . . . not doubting . . . that the Totality of a System was not only capable of being har monized with, but even calculated to aid, the unity . . . of a Poem." The first of these two latter statements was made in 1804, the second in 1815, and the comparative dates show how unremitting was Coleridge's pressure. In 1799 he had written, "I long to see what you are doing. O let it be the tail-piece of 'The Recluse!' for of nothing but 'The Recluse' can I hear patiently." Even as late as the Biographia Literaria in 1817, when it should have become apparent that there was never going to be a "Recluse," Coleridge was remorselessly saying that "what Mr. Words worth will produce, it is not for me to prophecy [sic]: but I could pronounce with the liveliest conviction what he is capable of producing. It is the first genuine philosophic poem"?and the words "first genuine philosophic poem" are hammered home in small capitals. Wordsworth strove manfully to oblige. To De Quincey in 1804 he spoke of "The Recluse" as a work to which "I mean to devote the Prime of my life and the chief force of my mind," and he identified this work as "a moral and Philosophical Poem; the subject whatever I find most interesting, in Nature Man Society, most adapted to Poetic Illustration." Indeed, Wordsworth always spoke of "The Recluse" as the supreme effort of his life. To Tobin in 1798, for instance, he called it "a poem in which I contrive to convey most of the knowledge of which I am possessed. My object is to give pictures of Nature, Man, and Society. Indeed, I know not any thing which will not come within the scope of my plan." The triple phrase "On Man, On Nature, and on Human Life" thus is programmatic for the philosophical commitment undertaken under the aegis of Coleridge, and the twin requirements of Coleridgean philo sophical depth and Miltonic epic height dovetail neatly, at least in Cole ridge's mind, for one of his praises of his friend was that Wordsworth had "more of the genius of a great philosophic poet than any man I ever knew, or, as I believe, has existed in England since Milton." To Words worth himself, however, both requirements were sources of anxiety, and together they resulted not merely in the turbulent surface of the "Prospectus" but in the incompleteness of "The Recluse" itself. Their twin threats seem to have some relevance to such diction in the first forty lines as "terror, single or in bands" and the "fear and awe / As fall upon us often when we look / Into our Minds, into the Mind of Man? / My haunt, and the main region of my song." The anxiety of Cole</page><page sequence="8">608 THOMAS McFARLAND ridgean depths and Miltonic heights seems particularly stark in the fervor with which Wordsworth invokes the aid of the muse: Urania, I shall need Thy guidance, or a greater Muse, if such Descend to earth or dwell in highest heaven! For I must tread on shadowy ground, must sink Deep?and, aloft ascending, breathe in worlds To which the heaven of heavens is but a veil. If we seek to identify the relative severity of the two sources of anxiety, we shall probably conclude that the Coleridgean philosophical commitment weighed even more heavily than did the Miltonic epic commitment. Coleridge, as we have seen, had in mind for "The Re cluse" the "Totality of a System," while Wordsworth had nervously spoken, in the letters to De Quincey and Tobin, of "whatever I find most interesting, in Nature Man Society" and of "pictures of Nature, Man, and Society." Pictures and whatever one finds most interesting do not add up to the totality of a system, and Wordsworth's anxiety at the discrepancy is palpable: I am very anxious to have your notes for the Recluse. I cannot say how much importance I attach to this, if it should please God that I survive you, I should reproach myself for ever in writing the work if I had neglected to procure this help. The anxiety in this request escalates to something very much like terror in a letter to Coleridge of about three weeks later, March 29, 1804: Your last letter but one informing us of your late attack was the severest shock to me, I think, I have ever received. ... I will not speak of other thoughts that passed through me; but I cannot help saying that I would gladly have given 3 fourths of my possessions for your letter on The Recluse at that time. I cannot say what a load it would be to me, should I survive you and you die without this memorial left behind. Do for heaven's sake, put this out of the reach of accident immediately. Coleridge, as we know, was not the most reliable of correspondents, so it was not until May 30, 1815, that he got around to responding to Wordsworth's frantic letter of March 29, 1804. In this answer he wrote down for Wordsworth the putative content of "The Recluse": I supposed you first to have meditated the faculties of Man in the abstract, in their correspondence with his Sphere of action, and . . . to have laid a solid and immoveable foundation for the Edifice by</page><page sequence="9">WORDSWORTH ON MAN, NATURE, AND HUMAN LIFE 609 removing the sandy Sophisms of Locke, and the Mechanic Dog matists, and demonstrating that the Senses were living growths and developements of the Mind &amp; Spirit in a much juster as well as higher sense, than the mind can be said to be formed by the Senses?. Next, I understood that you would take the Human Race in the concrete, have exploded the absurd notion of Pope's Essay on Man, Darwin, and all the countless Believers?even (strange to say) among Xtians of Man's having progressed from an Ouran Outang state?so contrary to all History, to all Religion, nay, to all Possi bility?to have affirmed a Fall in some sense, as a fact, the possibility of which cannot be understood from the nature of the Will, but the reality of which is attested by Experience &amp; Conscience?Fallen men contemplated in the different ages of the World, and in the different states?Savage-Barbarous?Civilized . . . and not disguis ing the sore evils, under which the whole Creation groans, to point out however a manifest scheme of Redemption from this Slavery, of Reconciliation from this Enmity with Nature . . . and to conclude by a grand didactic swell on the necessary identity of a true Philos ophy with true Religion ... in short, the necessity of a general revolution in the modes of developing &amp; disciplining the human mind by the substitution of Life, and Intelligence . . . for the philosophy of mechanism which in every thing that is most worthy of the human Intellect strikes Death. ... In short, Facts elevated into Theory?Theory into Laws?&amp; Laws into living &amp; intelligent Powers?true Idealism necessarily perfecting itself in Realism, &amp; Realism refining itself into Idealism.? Such or something like this was the Plan, I had supposed that you were engaged on?. All the elements of this daunting program had presumably been com municated to Wordsworth many times before in conversation, and they amply justify his appeal for help to Urania or a greater Muse and his feeling that he was going to "tread on shadowy ground," and "must sink Deep." The triple phrase "On man, on Nature, and on Human Life" is here expanded and ramified enormously, but it is nonetheless clearly discernible in Coleridge's projection. Wordsworth's "On Man" corresponds to Coleridge's "first to have meditated the faculties of Man in the abstract." The third part of Wordsworth's equation, "on Human Life" corresponds to Coleridge's understanding that "you would take the Human Race in the concrete." And the middle term of Wordsworth's progression, "on Nature," is rendered by Coleridge's plan for "Recon ciliation from this Enmity with Nature," as well by other statements that I have not quoted.</page><page sequence="10">610 THOMAS McFARLAND It is the daunting weight of the Coleridgean philosophical program that fractures the logic of the "Prospectus"'s beginning, just as the Miltonic invocations had disrupted its tone. When Milton begins Paradise Lost with his prepositional inversions, he sets in motion a fugue-like progression that does not come to a full stop until the end ofthe sixteenth line, with the statement that his poem "pursues / Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhyme." Along the way, the deferred Latinate verbal structure of "Sing Heavenly Muse" does not occur until line six, so that a wonderful extension occurs between "Of Man's First Disobedience" and "Sing Heavenly Muse." Wordsworth, however, comes to a full stop at line nine, comes to a full stop again at line thirteen, and does not get around to "I sing" until the end of the third sentence. The result is that the "I sing" has no reference to "On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life." And yet the triple phrase supposedly represents the theme of which he sings. Indeed, at line 753 of "Home at Grasmere" we read that "A Voice shall speak, and what will be the Theme? / On man, on Nature, and on Human Life / Musing in Solitude." But having the "I sing" at the end ofthe third sentence seems to show in the "Prospectus" that Wordsworth does not really want to sing about Man, Nature, and Human Life, or at any rate that the indefinite "Voice" that shall speak is not his own voice. Instead, his "I sing" refers to another prepositional inversion: "Of Truth, of Grandeur, Beauty, Love, and Hope, / Of blessed consolations in distress; / Of moral strength, and intellectual Power; / Of joy in widest commonalty spread" is what he will sing about. In other words, the beginning has been broken in two; the first part, which represents Coleridge's philosophical program, has been respect fully invoked but sealed off, and the second part, which is what Words worth seems really to intend to sing about, are the quintessentially Wordsworthian topics "Of Truth, of Grandeur, Beauty, Love, and Hope. . . . Of joy in widest commonalty spread" and so forth. I say quintessentially Wordsworthian, for it is one of the great poet's idio syncrasies, that he, and almost he alone, is repeatedly able to reanimate the great monolithic abstractions so worn down for most of us by daily usage. Wordsworth, almost alone among poets, can move us by simply invoking the word "Truth" or the word "Love" or the word "Power"; indeed, he can move us even by the still more abstract word "some thing." No one has ever been able satisfactorily to elucidate the secret of his unique gift for making these dry bones live, but none of us can read his poetry without realizing that he does so over and over again. He even moves us when abstraction is attenuated out of existence, as when he confesses that "I cannot paint / What then I was."</page><page sequence="11">WORDSWORTH ON MAN, NATURE, AND HUMAN LIFE 611 Thus Wordsworth, by fracturing the beginning, is enabled to substi tute the great abstractions of his characteristic discourse in place of the Coleridgean program "On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life," which refers to the alien requirement of "the Totality of a System." Yet the turbulence goes still deeper. As a program for a total system, the align ment of man, nature, and human life is somewhat askew. First of all, simply on its face it tends to be pleonastic, for "man" (not, we note, any individual man) is tautologous to "human life." Of course Words worth in his letters refers to the topic as "Nature, Man, and Society," which is somewhat more legitimately differentiated. Coleridge, too, indulging his symbiotic impulse, planned to write a vast poem called "The Brook," which in containing, as he said, "impassioned reflections on men, nature, and society," was clearly to have been an alternative version of "The Recluse." Notwithstanding all this, what Wordsworth actually writes in the "Prospectus" is not "Man, Nature, and Society," but the clouded formula "On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life." Furthermore, even had he written "On Man, on Nature, and on Society," such a tripartite formula would have still been askew with respect to the possibility of philosophical system. Wordsworth probably could not have known this, but Coleridge, as an enormously well informed student of such systems, knew it very well. The unwritten "The Recluse," of course, not only challenged Coleridge to write the companion unwritten poem called "The Brook"; but also "The Recluse" was an alternative version of Coleridge's own never-to-be-finished philosophical magnum opus. In abandoning serious poetry because, as he said, Wordsworth, in showing him what true poetry was, had made him know he was no poet, Coleridge took his revenge by depositing his own poetico-philosophical aspiration on Wordsworth's shoulders. "I abandon Poetry altogether," he wrote in 1800, "I leave the higher and deeper Kinds to Wordsworth." Such a bequest was to doom much of Wordsworth's later poetic possibility, for the higher and deeper kinds, in Coleridge's view, necessarily entailed a commitment to philosophy. "No man," wrote Coleridge, "was ever yet a great poet without being at the same time a profound philosopher." So "The Recluse" was really to have been a version of Coleridge's own magnum opus, as Coleridge indicates in some recollections of "The Recluse" in 1832: . . . the plan laid out, and, I believe, partly suggested by me, was, that Wordsworth should assume the station of a man in mental repose, one whose principles were made up, and so prepared to deliver upon authority a system of philosophy. He was to treat man</page><page sequence="12">612 THOMAS McFARLAND as man ... in contact with external nature, and informing the senses from the mind, and not compounding a mind out of the senses; then he was to describe the pastoral and other states of society, assuming something of the Juvenalian spirit as he ap proached the high civilization-of cities and towns, and opening a melancholy picture of the present state of degeneracy and vice; thence he was to infer ... a redemptive process in operation, showing how this idea reconciled all the anomalies, and promised future glory and restoration. Something of this sort was, I think, agreed on. It is, in substance, what I have been all my life doing in my [own] system of philosophy. Nevertheless, though Coleridge is willing to have Wordsworth phi losophize about Man, Nature, and Human Life, and can, when indulging his own symbiotic impulse for an alternative poem, speak of reflections on "men, nature, and society," when he refers to his magnum opus as a work of strict philosophy rather than as a poem, he changes the formula. The tripartite theme now becomes not man, nature, and society, but man, nature, and God. Considered as strict philosophy, Coleridge's magnum opus was to be, as he says, "A System of Truths respecting Nature, Man, and Deity, evolved from one Principle." Again, he calls it "researches and reflections concerning God, Nature, and Man"; still again, "God, Nature, and Man: A System ..." The change in the formula is not adventitious. There is obviously nothing to keep one from writing impassioned reflections on men, nature, and society if he so desires, or from musing on Man, on Nature, and on Human Life. But if one speaks of a "System of Truths," or wishes to achieve the "Totality of a System," then the formula, for good and proper reason, must change to man, nature, and God. As Hegel, the greatest of all philosophical systematists, remarks in the preface to the second edition of his Wissenschafi der Logik, "Die Philosophie uberhaupt hat es noch mit konkreten Gegenstanden, Gott, Natur, Geist, in ihren Gedanken zu tun"?philosophy in general occupies itself with three concrete objects, God, Nature and Mind. Hegel's "Gott, Natur, Geist" is precisely equiv alent to Coleridge's "Nature, Man, and Deity," and it is this triad with which systematic philosophers concern themselves, not with Man, Na ture, and Human Life. It is indeed instructive to note that Hegel classes "God" as a concrete object of the philosopher's attention, for in both his formula and Coleridge's, it is the God of the philosophers, not the anthropomorphic old man with the white beard, that is invoked. For systematic philosophizing, even an atheist would have to think about the problem of God.</page><page sequence="13">WORDSWORTH ON MAN, NATURE, AND HUMAN LIFE 613 Perhaps I can make the contention more clear by an explanation I wrote for another occasion: . . . if we agree with Aristotle that all philosophy begins in wonder, we must grant at the outset that we are beginning with two irre ducible?or at any rate basic?elements: someone to wonder, and something to wonder at. As Jacobi says ... 'I realize that I am, and that something is outside me, all in the same indivisible mo ment.' All philosophical systems, in short, involve an account of the relation of the wonderer?the self, the ego, the individual con sciousness?to the wondered at?the objective, the external, 'things.' From the interaction of wonderer and the wondered-at, a third basic category inevitably arises; from, on the one hand, the limitation of the wonderer's knowledge ('who am I?', 'why am I here?' 'where am I going?'), and on the other, the limitation inhering in the wondered-at ('what is it?', 'where did it come from?' 'why is it here?'). This third basic category of necessary philosophical involvement, arising as unbidden question from our immediate sense of limitation in our knowledge and our situation, constitutes that era of human concern termed the religious; and the most extended hypothetical answers to the totality of questions arising from these primal limitations are grouped under the symbolic term 'God.' 'To believe in a God,' says Wittgenstein simply, 'means to see that the facts of the world are not the end of the matter.' Thus all systematic philosophy must account for the status and interrelations of three entities, the ego or subject, the external or object, and the questions arising from the defining limitations of both subject and object, or the question of God. I have quoted my Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition at such length in order to elucidate the logical necessity of the triad, mind, nature, and God, and to show that no systematic accounting could arise from the Wordsworthian triad, Man, Nature, and Human Life. The matter is one of great importance, so much so that we should realize that the logical necessity was clear to thinkers in the time of Wordsworth and does not rely solely on my own analysis. Thus, to cite a single example, the influential academic philosopher, Christian Wolf, in his Latin treatise of 1728 called "Preliminary Discourse on Philosophy in General," writes as follows: The beings that we know are God, human souls, and bodies or material things. If we examine ourselves, we find that whenever we are conscious of things outside ourselves acting upon our sen</page><page sequence="14">614 THOMAS McFARLAND sory organ we are also conscious of ourselves. That in us that is conscious of itself is called the soul. Extended things, which differ from each other in figure and magnitude and which we intuit outside ourselves, are called bodies. Thus we admit a twofold genus of beings, namely, bodies and human souls. And as soon as we have seen that bodies and human souls are not independent beings, that is, they do not arise and persevere by their own power, we have also admitted an author of both bodies and souls, by whose power both of these genera of being were produced. This author of the things whose existence we know we call God. Therefore the beings that we know by examining ourselves before we philosophize are God, human souls, and bodies. Thus Wordsworth's formula for "The Recluse," "On Man, on Na ture, and on Human Life," despite its attempt to set the theme for a philosophical system, or to use Wordsworth's own aspiring words from The Prelude, "a philosophic song of Truth," could never have even tuated in such a system, and not merely the non-existence of "The Recluse" as a completed entity, but the hesitations, reluctances, and turbulence we have noted in the "Prospectus" itself, all bear witness to Wordsworth's perplexity as he faced his impossible task. At this point there is in a sense nothing more to say. Before concluding, however, I wish to take at least passing notice of three widely disparate matters that are unified by their common relationship to Wordsworth's tripartite formula. The first is a beautiful example, from our own day, of the coincidence of what Paul de Man calls blindness and insight. M. H. Abrams argues in his Natural Supernaturalism that a chief char acteristic of romantic conceivings was to depress the traditional threefold scheme of God, man and nature into a merely twofold scheme of man and nature. As he says, "Much of what distinguishes writers I call 'Romantic' derives from the fact that they undertook, whatever their religious creed or lack of creed, to save traditional concepts, schemes, and values which had been based on the relation of the Creator to his creature and creation, but to reformulate them within the prevailing two-term system of subject and object, ego and non-ego, the human mind or consciousness and its transactions with nature"; "the general tendency was, in diverse degrees and ways, to naturalize the supernatural and humanize the divine." But despite this compelling insight, and despite the fact that Abrams uses Wordsworth's "Prospectus" as his central text and even thinks of his book as being a kind of freely extended commentary to the "Prospectus," he unaccountably takes no notice that Wordsworth's triple phrase, with its tautology of Man and Human Life,</page><page sequence="15">WORDSWORTH ON MAN, NATURE, AND HUMAN LIFE 615 is a prime example of the very point he is making; for three-term, man nature-God conceiving is here pushed down into the linearity of two term, man-nature conceiving. The second observation is equally brief. Wordsworth, in the most familiar lines of the "Prospectus," writes that Paradise, and groves Elysian, Fortunate Fields?like those of old Sought in the Atlantic Main?why should they be A history only of departed things, Or a mere fiction of what never was? For the discerning intellect of Man When wedded to this goodly universe In love and holy passion, shall find these A simple produce of the common day. The sentiment is thoroughly Wordsworthian, and the poet goes on to say that he "Would chant . . . the spousal verse / Of this great consum mation." He is not content with mere metaphor, however, but then takes the idea into the formal realm of philosophy, and says that my voice proclaims How exquisitely the individual Mind ... to the external World Is fitted:?and how exquisitely, too? Theme but little heard among men? The external World is fitted to the Mind; The theme may be little heard among men, but it is frequently heard among philosophers, and it is still a lively topic in our own era. In Wordsworth's day, it had been the basis of an important treatise pub lished in 1790 by the Polish philosopher Salomon Maimon, called Ver such uber die Transzendentalphilosophie, which discussed precisely the ques tion of how the individual mind to the external world is fitted, and the external world fitted to the mind. The binding principle that Maimon sought, and that he called the problem of quid jurist, logically entailed the introduction of a third entity standing over the individual mind and the external world. So here too, Wordsworth could not have made philosophical headway in the terms he set for himself. The final observation I wish to make concerns the specifically Words worthian content of the triple phrase, "On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life." We can hardly believe that Coleridge deliberately misled his friend into substituting the man, nature, human life phrasing for the traditional man, nature, God formula, especially since Coleridge's sym</page><page sequence="16">616 THOMAS McFARLAND biotic leanings validated the former phrase as the topic of his own poem, "The Brook." I suspect rather that Coleridge's tolerance ofthe substitute phrase actually witnessed his respect for Wordsworth as a social thinker. "The French Revolution," as Shelley said to Byron, was "the master theme of the epoch in which we live"; and Wordsworth, alone among the major romantics, had actually experienced the French Revolution at first hand, a fact that greatly impressed Coleridge?and does me as well. As Coleridge writes in his poem composed after hearing The Prelude recited, Wordsworth speaks "Of more than Fancy, of the Social Sense / Distending wide, and man beloved as man, / Where France in all her towns lay vibrating / Like some becalmed bark beneath the burst of Heaven's immediate thunder," and he then says of Wordsworth, "thou wert there, thine own brows garlanded, / Amid the tremor of a realm aglow, / Amid a mighty nation jubilant, / When from the general heart of human kind / Hope sprang forth like a full-born Deity!" Immediately thereafter Coleridge hails Wordsworth in awed tones: "O great Bard / Ere yet that last strain dying awed the air / With stedfast eye I viewed thee in the choir / Of ever-enduring men. The truly great / Have all one age, and from one visible space / Shed influence." If it seems reasonable to believe that Coleridge's respect for Words worth's specially privileged social perspective allowed him to accept without demur the intensive tautology of man and human life, it seems equally reasonable to believe that the triple phrase had quite another urgency for Wordsworth himself. For Wordsworth the linearity of man, nature, and human life, in just that progression, attested an idiosyncratic progression in his own development of values. The nomination of man in the triple phrase does not, I believe, actually refer to man in the abstract, as Coleridge later remembered that he intended it to, but rather to man in the concrete, to Unamuno's "man of flesh and bone," that is, to Wordsworth himself. As he says at line 94 ofthe "Prospectus," he wanted, along "with the thing / Contemplated" to "describe the Mind and Man / Contemplating; and who, and what he was, / The transitory Being that beheld This Vision; when and where, and how he lived." And if "man" in the triple phrase is the man William Wordsworth, the philosophical subject, then the succession of nature and human life accords directly with the curious rubric of Book Eight of The Prelude, "Love of Nature Leading to Love of Man." I say "curious" advisedly, because normally the process of develop ment is for primary love of one human being to lead to the capacity for love in general. Wordsworth had difficulty, however, in following this path; for him nature actually did intervene. David Ferry argues that "Wordsworth is not a great lover of man but almost a great despiser of</page><page sequence="17">WORDSWORTH ON MAN, NATURE, AND HUMAN LIFE 617 him"; and David Perkins points out that "critics have tended to deny that Wordsworth possessed much sympathetic receptivity to the life around him. If it existed at all, it was certainly selective in accordance with his own intense preoccupations, directed only to some things, and specifically to nonhuman identities." Objects of nature, however, re ceived the full force of Wordsworth's emotional attention. As he says, he "first . . . looked / At Man through objects that were great and fair, / First communed with him by their help." "Mr. Wordsworth's char acteristic is one, and may be expressed in one word," judged Hazlitt, "... a power of raising the smallest things in nature into sublimity by the force of sentiment. He attaches the deepest and loftiest feelings to the meanest and most superficial objects." Elsewhere Hazlitt recalls his first meeting with Wordsworth, and at the outset he indicates the un usual sense of the poet's fixation upon external objects: "I think I see him now. . . . There was a severe, worn pressure of thought about his temples, a fire in his eye (as if he saw something in objects more than the outward appearance)." In short, as Wordsworth said, "deep feelings had impressed / So vividly great objects that they lay / Upon his mind like substances." This almost incredibly intense object-cathexis, to adopt Freudian ter minology, was, as Onorato has convincingly argued, a projection of Wordsworth's relationship with his mother; and it fixated itself as a denial of the loss of that relationship when she died: I was left alone Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why. The props of my affections were removed, And yet the building stood, as if sustained By its own spirit! Wordsworth himself, in remarkable pre-Freudian insight, says in Book Two of The Prelude that "blest the Babe, / Nursed in his Mother's arms," because in "one dear Presence," that of the mother, there exists A virtue which irradiates and exalts Objects through widest intercourse of sense . . . Along his infant veins are interfused The gravitation ^nd the filial bond Of nature that connect him with the world. Is there a flower, to which he points . . . already love Drawn from love's purest earthly fount for him Hath beautified that flower.</page><page sequence="18">618 THOMAS McFARLAND Accordingly, the "still, sad music of humanity" in "Tintern Abbey" is heard only as an outgrowth and replacement of the time in childhood when "nature then . . . / To me was all in all"; the "soothing thoughts that spring / Out of human suffering" in the "Immortality" ode are a replacement for the lost hour of "splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower." The idea of humanity, or of human life in general, was seen by man, or the "Mind and Man / Contemplating," only through the lens of nature. As Wordsworth says in The Prelude's Eighth Book, "human kind" did not for him early take "a place-preeminent." When his "own pursuits / And animal activities," with "all / Their trivial pleasures" drooped and gradually expired, and "Nature, prized / For her own sake, became my joy, even then? / And upwards through late youth, until not less / Than two-and-twenty summers had been told? / Was Man in my affections and regards / Subordinate to her." So Wordsworth's triple phrase, "On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life," though inauthentic with regard to the possibilities of a poem that would set forth a philosophical system, was authentic in terms of Words worth's idiosyncratic development. Though the triple phrase was a doorway to turbulent anxieties, it was also a doorway to Wordsworth's own development of social values. As such, it is a fitting, paradoxical beginning to a poem vast in design and import, but unachieved and broken in its fact.
