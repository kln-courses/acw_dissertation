<plain_text><page sequence="1">Truth in forgery ESTHER PASZTORY In his paper on forgery, Rudolf Arnheim quoted a delightful passage from Michel Tournier's novel, Le Roi des Aulnes, about an ornithology professor "who when asked to listen to recordings of bird songs could identify with assurance only imitations produced by a music hall whistler. The authentic songs, which had been obtained in nature, with much trouble, he thought were fuzzy, hardly characteristic, and, in other words, total failures" (Arnheim 1983:232). Forgery is not as simple as it looks. The attitude most writers take to forgery is that it is morally and aesthetically, to say nothing of financially, offensive. To discover that a famous piece is fake is to stumble upon an obscenity?like a famous person playing with feces or interested in necromancy. The transgressive object falls immediately into the one zone that Kant felt could never be aesthetic?the disgusting. Such objects disappear from view into a titillating darkness akin to pornography. We are outraged because we thought that we were intellectually too sophisticated or aesthetically sensitive to have been taken in and we have been shown up as stupid and dense. We do not like to be reminded that we have been fools. We let the forgeries go to hell like fallen angels and cling more closely to the pieces we believe are authentic. But time, like the Grim Reaper, reveals beloved piece after beloved piece as false nonetheless. I once played the role of the Grim Reaper myself, sending three spectacular Aztec masks to the netherworld of forgeries (Rasztory 1982). I was recently asked to write entries to the new Mus?e du Louvre catalogue for which I declined to write on certain pieces that others and I thought questionable (Kerchache et al. 2000). The Louvre nevertheless included them, since it was felt perhaps that it was better to have them with some doubt than not to have them at all. Before they are definitively unmasked, forgeries are intensely loved. We have to be willing to look at our less desirable characteristics in the mirror before we can put the forgeries back on their stands and learn the lessons they have to teach. Like Michel Tournier's ornithologist, we have to accept that we understand the copies better than the originals. Fakes tell us what we want to see in the authentic. Most frightening, fakes show us what our fantasies of the originals were and how far they were off the mark. Fakes tell us about ourselves?what we think we see when we look at the things of another time and place. Take the British Museum masks I once uncovered as false?what story do they tell of the mid-nineteenth century vision of the Aztecs? The easy giveaways were the four-armed figures in the back of two beautiful stone masks, which obviously expressed a former popular misconception that the Aztecs were related to other ancient cultures such as the Hindus. We know now that the Aztecs never showed their gods with multiple limbs and that alone damns the masks despite their collection pedigree dating from the nineteenth century. But time has revealed much more than that bit of na?vet?. We know that the Aztecs and their sculptures were the best known and the most collected in nineteenth century Mexico and that there was a market, especially among foreigners living in Mexico, for Aztec antiquities. If we want to understand how those collectors saw Aztec art we have to interrogate the forgery that was made to fit their tastes and interests. First of all, the aspect that has won the British Museum masks masterpiece status is the subtle modeling of the face, the elegant curve of the eyes, the indeed Hindu-Buddhist languidness of the expression, the absolute precision of line and polish, and the delicate parting of the hair (a non-pre-Columbian detail I picked up once I had my doubts). The masks are exquisite in the Western sense of craft and aesthetic feeling. Look at any other "genuine" Aztec mask, and none is so elegant and refined nor has parted hair. In fact, most Aztec pieces are a little "fuzzy" in the sense of Tournier's birdsong, as if the Aztecs had not understood their own style as well as we do. The second, only seemingly contradictory aspect is that this exquisite face represents flayed skin?to us the epitome of barbaric sacrificial ritual. Whoever made the masks knew that this quality not only did not repel or disgust the future buyer, but also was a part of its attraction and authenticity. Aztec art was glossed as exquisite and brutal, and the fake masks serve both criteria. I am suggesting that the British Museum masks embody Western taste at a particular time and are as valuable as any other documents. In fact, they are more so, because they make the concepts of a period visible in form. Pre-Columbian art history is a Western artifact and its material consists not only of texts but also of the objects in museums and collections, including the fakes. What do we Westerners like about pre-Columbian objects? First of all, we have a preference for the representation of the human body and the human face</page><page sequence="2">160 RES 42 AUTUMN 2002 as any book or catalogue illustrations testify. Our favorite pieces are anthropomorphic and this preference derives ultimately from our figurai classical traditions. We are much more ambivalent about ornament and pattern. If it is a figure, it is "Art" and we can relate to the figure even if it is strongly stylized. Like the ornithologist, we look for well-defined styles that can be classified, analyzed, contrasted, and appreciated and relegate the indeterminate, shapeless, "fuzzy" stuff to the storeroom. Once a style becomes known visually and defined verbally, it is applied "over" pieces like a schema through which we see them and therefore like them, or not. Pieces without a schema are problematic. Favorite pieces are those that have the schema but edge out of it in some way we consider remarkable. I was once puzzled by the traveler artist Jean-Fr?d?rick Waldeck, who in the early nineteenth century seemed to have little trouble drawing Aztec sculptures in his and his friends' collections, such as stone sculptures of deities or mythical creatures like feathered serpents (Baudez 1993:pl. 3,6), but had problems copying Maya reliefs (ibid.:pls. 18, 20), for the inaccuracies of which he is always castigated. Given his Neoclassic artistic background and the "Classical" looking naturalism of Palenque style, the Maya pieces should have been easier for Waldeck. But Maya as a style had not yet been defined in Western eyes when Waldeck drew them, and he made some absurd exaggerations. By contrast, the Aztec style?or schema?evidently had been well defined. His correct and self-confident lines in the drawing of the Basel Old God indicate that he "saw" it and appreciated it pretty much for what it was. Drawing is as much an "interpretation" as is faking. Waldeck, too, like the maker of the British Museum masks, and perhaps many others at the time, was fascinated by the barbaric flaying ritual and imagined how the skin would look on its wearer in several drawings (ibid.:pl. 4). Although Waldeck was well connected with the antiquities scene in Mexico, curiously he was unaware of, or made no drawing of, the British Museum masks. But he owned and painted the jade masquette now in the Muse de l'Homme on which they might have been based (ibid.: fig. 6; Kerchache et al. 2000:418). The jade masquette, which I began to suspect because of its many similarities to the British Museum masks, including the parted hair, may have been an earlier admired piece that already set up the theme of the beautiful grotesque with flayed skin and parted hair. For a while I even suspected Waldeck of the forgeries since he was in possession of all the artistic and cultural ideas, was aware of all the related pieces, boasted of making forgeries, and last but not least, had the motive: a constant need of money. However, I could not pin it on him. Indeed if he could have made them, so could someone else at the time. Jane Walsh (1997) has done splendid detecting in the case of the fake Aztec crystal skulls. She and Claude Baudez became interested recently in Aztec sculptures and see the European museum collections as especially full of fakes that have become visible to us only now (personal communication, 1999). Walsh believes that most of these fake Aztec works came out of the workshop of one master artist in the nineteenth century whose hand is immediately recognizable to her. I look forward to her forthcoming publication. I had many doubts about authenticity when I wrote Aztec Art (1983), and my solution was to leave out pieces I was not sure of, but without labeling them as fakes. I had doubts about the red porphyry Quetzalcoatl in the Mus?e de l'Homme with its sweet face and limbs strangely outside the serpent (Kerchache et al. 2000: 407-408) or the Dumbarton Oaks greenstone Tlazolteotl giving birth (Rasztory 1982:fig. 8). Gordon Ekholm used to say beware of obsidian because objects in that material tend to be fake (personal communication, 1970s), but the same goes for jade and other exotic stones. The goddess giving birth is one of our pre-Columbian icons and is one of the most popular pieces at Dumbarton Oaks. When Indiana Jones found a gold idol in the jungle its form was that of the Dumbarton Oaks figure. She is beautiful, naturalistic, and quite polished on the one hand while the graphic depiction of birth and her giant grin of pain are as transgressive as being flayed. No other Aztec sculptural figure gives birth like this. Whether "authentic" or not this image is one of our Aztec idols. I left her out of my book on Aztec art, but having similar doubts, I left in a related jade rabbit with a head on its belly (P?sztory 1983:opp. 240). The same carver might have made both. (One cannot throw everything out!) I also accepted famous pieces some of which have subsequently been questioned, such as the Stuttgart Xolotl and the Vienna pulque beaker (ibid.:pls. 49, 50). What is so fascinating is that the canonical and the fake sometimes turn out to be the same. These last two objects, besides being incredibly beautifully carved and full of transgressive death imagery, are also important for a vast amount of iconographie detail that has been exhaustively analyzed. We Westerners like our canonical objects to be complicated and in need of decoding. Edward Seler, who was the first decoder of the Aztec symbol system,</page><page sequence="3">Pasztory: Truth in forgery 161 understood what it was that we wanted from such an exotic tradition. In an article entitled "Das Pulquegef?ss des Bilimek'schen Sammlung im K.K. naturhistorischen Hofmuseum" (1960), he points out that we want the Aztecs to be completely "other," with a different sense of time, of history, of religious identity and self, and to indicate an unbridgeable difference. At the same time, the brilliant Western scholar could find the magic thread that made sense of it all and could decode the mystery by entering the mindset of the native.1 Objects like the Stuttgart Xolotl and the Vienna pulque beaker lend themselves to this enterprise. There are two major ways in which pre-Columbian works have been appreciated?formally and aesthetically, and as objects to be decoded. The former route is preferred by the forgers. The latter, iconographie route is fraught with more difficulties and less frequently attempted by forgers?you have to be too up on recent research. The lessons of faking are more in the nebulous and instructive realm of form and aesthetics. Form belongs to body language and instinctive, nonconscious thinking that bypasses the verbal. Verbally we are most comfortable with judgments such as "this is beautiful" or "this is ugly." As Kant is believed to have pointed out, such judgments are universally made?we are wired for them. Language leads to judgment quite easily. Language is also necessary in decoding. But language does not lead us to adequate description or analysis of form which is difficult to learn and often awkward and unconvincing when expressed. Forgeries are precious to our understanding because they explain and expound on form in the nonverbal way of making another form. They also demonstrate the subtlety of formal language with its many hard-to-verbalize distinctions in which one needs to be trained as much as in verbal skill. It is what I call "thinking with things."2 Take the work of a recent Veracruz forger who made terracotta "copies" of originals which were sold to major museums and collectors. His works were so good that they went entirely undetected and he was actually accused of trafficking in antiquities. To avoid jail, Brigido Lara revealed that these were forgeries he had made, and not real antiquities. He had to prove his assertion by making such a "copy" (Crossley and Wagner 1987). Brigido Lara is a modern forger who used the right materials, tools, and clays, and had access to objects and books to make the "perfect" forgeries. Indeed his works were so indistinguishable from the originals that he had to point them out and make new ones to prove his case. Yet when you examine these "indistinguishable" works the Western aesthetic vision is clear. Brigido Lara's objects are always a bit more defined, a bit more articulated, a bit neater and "stylistically" more correct than the originals. The originals are more vague and less pleasing in form. Forgers improve on the originals to fit them into our concept of style. Canonical works, whether fakes or not, are like forgeries in expressing in some extreme way our idea of what is authentic or meaningful in the pre-Columbian past.3 The little greeenstone bust of an Olmec woman in the Dumbarton Oaks collection came to my attention briefly when I was examining the British Museum masks because of its striated hair, which seemed to link many of my suspect pieces together (Coe 1993:fig. 6). It's a fascinating image in that there is no iconographie detail to take away from the exotic facial type rendered with remarkable virtuosity. Most striking to me was how the sculpture seemed to be broken?the face and hair were unmarred but the arms were rough stumps that heighten the aesthetic effect of the piece much in the manner of early-twentieth-century sculpture. Auguste Rodin came to mind. This was one of the favorite Olmec pieces collected by the Blisses and used to be frequently illustrated. The Bliss Olmec woman?it matters not whether she is fake or real for my discussion?speaks volumes about the Western taste for pre-Columbian art, which I will condense into six points: 1. Precious material 2. Exquisite technical virtuosity despite use of stone tools 3. Breathtaking naturalism 4. A simultaneous simplification of form into abstraction that conveys the exotic 5. A bizarre, grotesque, ugly, or bloody aspect that is a transgression of European norms 6. Some kind of glyphic or structural complexity to be decoded These qualities are reducible to two contradictory aspects: "Us" and "Others." We admire pieces laboriously crafted in precious material in a naturalistic style that we read as indications of high culture and 1. The article cited is only one example of Seler's vast output. 2. Thinking with Things is the title of my forthcoming book from the University of Texas Press. 3. George Kubler expressed what works to him were canonical in a 1984 article (Kubier 1984:240-246). Curiously, since then, myself and others have questioned the authenticity of many of his favorites.</page><page sequence="4">162 RES 42 AUTUMN 2002 sophistication?like "Us." At the same time we want an exotic culture to be exotic, which means transgressing European norms that are signified both by the bizarre and stylization?hallmarks of "Others." Precious materials are characteristic of many fakes and therefore of our vision. No one knows how much of South American gold is fake, but according to Robert Sonin the estimates are high (personal communication over the years). Gold is still the ultimate treasure. So then that is our Dorian Gray self-portrait. How are we going to deal with pre-Columbian objects that are often neither exquisite nor as wild as we want them to be? How are we to select "masterpieces"? I would like to end this rumination with the issues presented by the Corona Wrestler (fig. 1). This sculpture was on the cover of the first edition of George Kubler's then definitive and pioneering work of art history, The Art and Architecture of Ancient America (1962). It was also on the cover of Michael D. Coe's popular survey, Mexico (1966). It is curious that these two scholars who did not see eye to eye on many issues agreed (along with their publishers) on the canonical value of this image and its possible resonance with the purchaser.4 On this sculpture, and many of the others mentioned before, I used to dwell lovingly in class in my first years of teaching. Like the Blisses and other collectors, I found some pieces easier to relate to than others. There is the twist in the torso, the exquisitely detailed musculature, and the incredible preservation of the sculpture, all of which made it a canonical piece. In class, students gasped on seeing it, just as they did with the British Museum masks. Did Indians really make these fantastic objects? Questions about the Corona Wrestler arose slowly and were increased by Susan Milbrath's study (1979) of Olmec sculpture. She found that the size and scale of the wrestler figure were anomalous in Olmec tradition. The piece was an oddity?either a "masterpiece" by a unique artist or a fake (note how close these two categories are to each other). Moreover the fact of its preservation was curious?many Olmec sculptures are mutilated and often lack a head. Then came Michael Coe's excavation of San Lorenzo in the 1960s with the find of Monument 34, which also exhibits a twist in the torso and asymmetrical legs, but lacks the refinement of detail of the wrestler (Coe 1968) (fig 2). I found myself gradually dropping the Corona Wrestler from class and substituting Monument 34. 4. Subsequently both books have different covers. The currently popular book cover is the "bloodletting" Lintel 24 from Structure 23 at Yaxchil?n, which expresses a more violent, bizarre, and less aesthetic pre-Columbian ideal. Figure 1. Corona Wrestler, Olmec style figure, stone. Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a, Mexico When I gave the talk about the British Museum masks as forgeries in 1978, someone came up afterward and said in a plaintive voice, "You can't take these away from us!" Sometimes forgeries are better than the real thing because they fit our ideas better. A history of art is written in our forgeries through time that tells us more precisely what we value in pre-Columbian art than any text. Actions speak louder than words. Forgeries tell us unpleasant truths. Who are we looking for when we think we are looking for the "Other"? And if we are really trying to find ourselves, do we know who we are, finally? We need to keep some of those forgeries around instead of hiding them away. And where are the forgeries of yesteryear? Many writers described vast amounts of nineteenth-century Aztec ceramics forgeries that were ridiculously non-pre Columbian. Holmes (1986) was the Grim Reaper who swept these fakes away so successfully that most have disappeared. He published only drawings of fantastic tiered vessels or pathetic dying Aztecs. I had seen a few,</page><page sequence="5">Rasztory: Truth in forgery 163 Figure 2. San Lorenzo Monument 34, kneeling figure, c. 1200 b.c., stone. Museo de Antropolog?a de Xalapa, Universidad Veracruzana; photograph: Arqueolog?a Mexicana, Marco Antonion Pacheco/Ra?ces. small nineteenth-century ceramic fakes in Frederick Church's home at Olana but no big "masterpieces." Vienna once had a large collection sponsored by the emperor Maximilian, but by now they have mostly been thrown out. Two pieces were, however, kept as examples. I was at the Museum f?r V?lkerkunde in Vienna selecting objects for the exhibition, Teotihuacan: City of the Gods, and Aztec fakes by chance came into discussion with Christian Feest, the curator. I was excited to be able to see the two pieces the museum had decided to keep from the trash heap. One of the fakes is an especially large and impressive pitcher (fig. 3). A careful drawing of its front and side views is found in the museum's book of registry.5 A long extract from an 1880 letter above the drawing of the pitcher referred to the find of exquisitely made crystal skulls in a cave full of Aztec mummies!6 What could be more romantic. According to this text, Father Fischer, Maximilian's secretary, held the skulls in great esteem because they demonstrated a higher cultural level for the inhabitants of the Americas than had been believed before. The ceramic pitcher was placed in excellent company. I knew from Holmes's drawings that the pitcher was likely to have a European form?in this case an ordinary pitcher?and that many small figures and molded designs would be stuck all over it, making it very "complicated" (fig. 4). Nevertheless, I was unprepared for its great size?32 cm high by 28 cm wide?and even more its weight. It is almost impossible to imagine carrying it full of liquid. Its walls are more than a centimeter thick. It is made of a crude, cracking mass of clay. All Aztec luxury ceramics had thin walls and fine decoration. The Vienna pitcher, I imagine, was intended to be a "masterpiece" and I named it "Montezuma's pitcher" to myself. Yet it was so crude that even a beginning potter could have made it. None of these features was visible in the drawing, and only in life could I really understand this aspect of the nineteenth century European view of the Aztecs?which was its own tasteless, overdecorated fantasy of primitive crudity. The attachment of more or less genuine stamps and figurines to the pitcher suggests that ancient American identity was seen as consisting of entirely superficial matter stuck on heiter skelter. The crowding of these additions is for the European the very sign of backward taste, of barbaric splendor. There is a whole treatise lurking in "Montezuma's pitcher." It is obvious why such crude fakes by now have been thrown out from most collections at one time or another.7 That they were collected at all is embarrassing to our own self-esteem and since there is nothing Aztec about them, why keep them? Probably many fell apart on their own (P?sztory 1982:90). But though they were fake Aztec, they are genuine embodiments of a European vision of the exotic and as such documents of our history. Rather than disowning them we need to look at these fakes to find out who we were, which is relatively easy, and who we are now, which is much more difficult. Forgeries tell us our fantasies about ourselves in shapes and forms that we take for granted, 6. I am indebted to Jennifer Anlfeldt for the translation of the letter by Dr. Semeleder. 7. I have since learned that there is a large collection of similar fakes in the Smithsonian collection in Washington, D.C. 5.

Pre Columbian art has been a construct of such unconscious fantasies and we need to try to separate what really is native from our projections on it. We need to look especially at the canon?the real as well as the spurious?and ask why these pieces were selected in the first place, and try to pry apart our aesthetic from that of the pre-Columbian others. Is there a pre-Columbian art history and appreciation outside of our own aesthetic? Fakes hold a corrective truth.
