<plain_text><page sequence="1">"A Mixture of Living Creatures": Man and Animal in the Works of A. Platonov Hans Günther Bielefeld University Translated from the Russian by Sergey Levchin 1. A certain contemporary of Platonov recalls that Andrei Platonovich was extremely upset and anguished after a crow was shot and killed in his presence.1 According to this eyewitness, Platonov "loved animals and believed in their humanity."2 Of course, there is evidence beyond this particular incident to support such claims. An analysis of Platonov's works reveals a broad spectrum of philosophical and aesthetic motifs dealing with the relationship between man and animal. The various instances of anthropomorphism, zoomorphism and metamorphosis are underpinned by Platonov's conviction that the difference between the two is one of degree, not kind. In this view, the transition from one state to the other has nothing fantastical about it. In his Zapisttye kni^hki ( Notebooks ), Platonov emphasizes the kinship between man and animal, writing: "Animals and plants are always our contemporaries; it is not a matter of atavism, but one of friendship and spiritual hygiene" («Животные и растения - всегда наши современники, и дело совсем не в атавизме, а в дружбе, в санитарии души»).3 And elsewhere in the text he writes: "Not an evolutionary ladder, but a mixture of living creatures, a conglomerate" («Не лестница эволюции, а смешение живых существ, общий конгломерат»).4 The gradualness of the transitions between man, animal, plant and mineral, i.e. between substances in different states, was one of the fundamental theses of Vladimir Vernadsky's Biosfera ( Biosphere , 1926), a book with which Platonov had been acquainted.5 1 This article was originally published in Russian.

The noble qualities of animals had been a major theme in Russian literature as far back as the classical period. Undoubtedly, the horse occupies the principal position in this hierarchy. According to Vladimir Markov, "the horse is typically presented as a symbol of human suffering. This underscores its exceptional 'humanity,' and its suffering thus assumes greater nobility and consequently has greater aesthetic power."6 By way of illustration we might refer to the well-known verses of N. Nekrasov that depict a crippled horse charged with a backbreaking load and suffering cruel abuse from its master: Вся дымясь, оседая назад, Лошадь только вздыхала глубоко И глядела ... (так люди глядят, покоряясь неравным нападкам).7 All steaming, slumping on its hinds, the horse could only sigh and stare. . . (as people stare submitting to unequal blows). In his various accounts of horses Dostoevsky contrasts the extreme cruelty and compassion of man toward the suffering beast. In Raskolnikov's dream, a drunken and sadistic master whips to death a scrawny nag.8 In Brati' а К aramado v у ( The Brothers Karamazov), Father Zosima comments on the tortured visages of the horse and the ox: "...look at their faces, what meekness, what devotion to man, who often beats them mercilessly. What gentleness, what confidence and what (Moscow: IMLI RAN, 2003), 319-327; С. Brei', "KuFtumye konteksty poetiki 'zhivogo- nezhivogo' A.

(«Какая кротость, какая привязанность к человеку, часто бьющему его безжалостно, какая незлобивость, какая доверчивость и какая красота в его лике»).9 In the Russian theological and philosophical traditions, we likewise find man chided for his unfounded superiority over animals. Nikolai Fedorov notes that the idea of progress implies superiority not only over preceding generations, but over animals as well. Since man's pretensions about his capacity for abstract thought and his advancement of knowledge prove inconsequential in the face of Nature's blind forces, they cannot justify his placing himself above animals. In Smysl' tvorchestva ( The Meaning of the Creative Act), Nikolai Berdiaev writes that the fall of man brought about the fall and the mortification of all the inferior strata of nature, since man, as its highest rung, was held responsible for the whole cosmic order. He emphasizes Paul's idea that "the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now" (Romans 8:22) awaiting its liberation.10 The Dukhobor sect had great respect for cows, believing that human souls were reincarnated in them. Refusing to exploit animal labor, they pulled their own plows and carts.11 We can assume that Tolstoy's novella Kholstomer, wherein a horse is shown to be morally superior to humans, reflects similar sectarian sentiments. Its erotic themes are doubtless linked with the castration doctrine of the Khlysty sect,12 but its polemic against private property is most likely borrowed from the teachings of the Dukhobors. It is certain, at any rate, that the idea of redemption of the whole of creation appears prominently in the heterodox sectarian milieu, while mainstream philosophical and theological traditions emphasize a fundamental distinction between the human and animal natures.13 The modernist era sees a heightened interest in animal nature. The "rise" of the animal takes place against the background of the critique of anthropocentrism, rationalism and the philosophy of progress. In contradistinction, the animal is hailed as an exponent of a primordial lost paradise, pre-logical wisdom and higher intuitive knowledge. It is said that Nietzsche, upon seeing a carriage driver cruelly mistreating his horse 9 Dostoevskij, PSS, t. 14, 267. English translation from Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov, trans.

The motif of animal salvation gains strength in the works of the poets and artists of the first decade of the 20th century with a turn toward primitivism. In a declaration of 1904 Khlebnikov requests the following epitaph to be carved on his tombstone: "He saw no distinction between the human and animal species, and stood for the extension to the noble animal species of the commandment 'Love thy neighbor as thyself" («Он не видел различия между человеческим видом и животными видами и стоял за распространение на благородные животные виды заповеди и ее действия 'люби ближнего, как самого себя'»).14 And Esenin's lyrical hero considers himself happy, because "the beastly kind, our younger brothers/ he never struck upon the head" («зверье, как братьев наших меньших, / Никогда не бил по голове»).15 The motif of man's estrangement from Nature in the course of the evolutionary process and the unfortunate consequences of his assuming dominion of the earth recurs frequently in Khlebnikov's writing. The poem "Zverinets" ("Menagerie") laments "the demise of some kind of magnificent potential" of the caged animals: «погибают какие-то прекрасные возможности».16 The same theme resurfaces in Khlebnikov's "Utes iz budushchegp" ("A Cliff from the Future"): Человек отнял поверхность земного шара у мудрой общины зверей и растений и стал одинок: ему не с кем играть в пятнашки и жмурки в пустом покое, темнота небытия кругом, нет игры, нет товарищей. С кем ему баловаться? Кругом пустое "нет". Изгнанные из туловищ души звери бросились в него и населили своим законом его стены. Построили в сердце звериные города. Man has taken the surface of Planet Earth away from the wise community of animals and plants and now he is lonely; he has no one to play tag or hide-and-seek with. In his empty room, surrounded by the darkness of nonbeing, there are no playmates and no games. Who can he play with? He is surrounded by an empty no. The souls of animals banished from their bodies have invaded him, and the plains of his being are now subject to their law. They built animal cities in his heart. 14 V.

И мы снова счастливы: вот лев спит у меня на коленях, и теперь я курю мой воздушный обед. The beautiful gift of the right to live has been given back to animals and plants. And once more we are happy: a lion lies curled in my lap, asleep, and I sit here smoking my supper of air.17 The theme of the superiority of animal over man continues in Khlebnikov's poem about the Horsekingdom, from the cycle "Voina v myshelovke" ("War in a Mousetrap"): где конь звероокий с волной белоснежной Стоит, как судья у помоста И дышло везут колесницы тележной Дроби преступные, со ста. [...] Мы стали лучше и небесней, Когда доверились коням. О, люди! Так разрешите вас назвать! Where a wide-eyed white-maned stallion stands like a judge on his platform, and the tongue of the wagon is hitched to the criminal fraction, one to a hundred. [...] We were better people, closer to heaven, when we let horses be our guides. 'Teople" - why do we call ourselves that? 18 And in the long poem "Ladomir" (translated into English as "Lightland") one discerns the Utopian wish for the redemption and humanization of animals in a future life: И идут люди, и идут звери На бошроды современниц.

I see horse- freedom and equal rights for cows.19 Mayakovsky's well-known poem "Khoroshee otnoshenie к loshadiam" ("Good Treatment of Horses/' 1918) is built around the act of identifying with an animal. И какая-то общая Звериная тоска Плеща вылилась из меня И расплылась в шелесте. «Лошадь, не надо. Лошадь, слушайте - чего вы думаете, что вы их плоше? Деточка, все мы немножко лошади, каждый из нас по своему лошадь».20 Some sort of general animal longing poured out of me, splashing, and dissolved in the rustle. "Horse, don't. Horse, listen to me - you think they're any better than you? Baby, all of us are a little bit horses, each of us in his own way horse." The theme of the dying horse also appears in a poem by Brecht, recounting - from the horse's perspective - an assault by a band of starving men, intending to cut a piece of meat from its bones.21 The German poet naturally puts his own peculiar spin on the situation: since it is hunger that drives men to such extremes, Brecht calls for a social order that excludes mass hunger. A similar incident - without the comforting social outlook - receives an entirely different treatment in Khlebnikov's hands: "A dying horse, covered with burlap, had gathered a crowd. The spectacle of death that gathers flies is always splendid and wrathful" («Умирающий конь, покрытый рогожей, собрал толпу. 10 Khlebnikov, Tvorenüa^T№' Khlebnikov, Collected Works, v. 3, 176. 20 V.

Platonov 257 Зрелище смерти, что собирает мошек, всегда прекрасно и гневно»).22 In this context, the poetry of Nikolai Zabolotsky holds a prominent position, for it highlights the contradiction between the spiritual richness of the animal world and its mournful existence in the service of man. The suffering of horses is given special place in Zabolotsky's writings. So, in the poem "Litso konia" ("Face of a Horse," 1 926) we read: Лицо коня прекрасней и умней. Он слышит говор листьев и камней. Внимательный! Он знает крик звериный И в ветхой роще рокот соловьиный. И зная все, кому расскажет он Свои чудесные виденья? [...] И если б человек увидел Лицо волшебное коня, Он вырвал бы язык бессильный свой И отдал бы коню. Поистине достоин Иметь язык волшебный конь!23 The face of a horse is more beautiful and more intelligent. He hears the murmur of leaves and stones. Attentive! He knows the animal cry and the nightingale's warble in the antic grove. And knowing all, whom shall he tell his marvelous visions? [...] And if man saw the magical face of the horse, he would tear out his impotent tongue and hand it over to the horse. Verily, he is worthy of having a tongue, the magical horse! But since the horse lacks a tongue its grief goes unnoticed, and the next day man compels it to serve him:24 22 V.

The lack of human speech among animals is a shared motif for Zabolotsky and Platonov.26 Both "compensate" for the muteness of animals by emphasizing the expressivity of their faces, and of their eyes in particular. There is, however, a language with which Zabolotsky's animals communicate among themselves. In the poem 'Torzhestvo zemledeliia" ("The Triumph of Agriculture," 1929-30) they hold a "fluent conversation" («свободный разговор») about their suffering. The "Horse Institute" offers instruction to animals, as we discover from the account of the ass, often regarded as the most foolish of the animals: Осел, товарищем ведом Приходит, голоден и хром, Его, как мальчика, питают, Ума растенье развивают.27 The ass led by his comrade comes, hungry and lame. They nurse him like a child, and cultivate his mind. The poem ends with a Utopian picture of a golden age free from man's violence over nature. Liberated from hard, indentured labor, men and animals - including the enlightened ass - hail the triumph of fertility: В хлеву свободу пел осел, Достигнув полного ума. 28 25 Ibid., 105. 26 Timofeeva argues that "Platonov's animals are disguised men, tormented by what is in them inexpressible, unacknowledged, hidden in the mind's flesh." (Timofeeva, "Bednaia zhizn'"104.) 27 Zabolotskii, Polnoe sobrante stikho tv o re nii i po e m , 152. 28 Ibid., 157. Naturally, the figure of the ass outraged Soviet censors and was interpreted as calumny against collectivization.</page><page sequence="9">Man and Animal in the Works of A. Platonov 259 The ass, now full of wits, sang freedom in his stall. Various themes associated with the exaltation of animal nature pervade the visual artworks of the German Expressionist movement. Franz Marc, famous for his numerous depictions of animals, opposes the anthropocentric worldview with a demand for the "animalization of the arts" with this question: "Is there a more mysterious idea for an artist than to imagine how nature is reflected in the eyes of an animal? How does a horse see the world, how does an eagle, a doe, or a dog?"29 The artist feels that he must paint the forest or the horse not as seen by human eyes, but "as they really are .,x3° Similar ideas are characteristic of the Russian painter Nikolai Filonov: "Man probably appears very different to animal eyes than he does to our own. A picture of a man drawn by an animal would astonish us. Nothing painted by a child or a savage could come close, it seems."31 But in practice Filonov approached the problem in a manner quite different from Marc's. While the German painter depicts idealized horses and roe deer in natural surroundings as the embodiment of a higher spiritual state, Filonov's animals are closely linked to human society and urban civilization. Kovtun emphasizes the humanity of Filonov's animals, citing Khlebnikov: Я со стены письма Филонова Смотрю, как конь усталый, до конца. И много муки в письме у оного, В глазах у конского лица.32 I gaze down from Filonov's painting like a tired old horse, to the end. And there is much suffering in his painting, in the eyes on the horse's face. In connection with this, Kovtun underscores the "anthropomorphism of horses' heads and, on the contrary, the appearance of animal features on 29 Franz Marc, "How Does a Horse See the World," trans.

The painter was familiar with the biological monism of the German philosopher Ernst Haeckel, who sought to reconcile science and theology.34 Filonov's conception of the world as a homogenous continuum, and its corollary rejection of a hierarchical division of the world35 to a great extent resembles Platonov's view of the continuous transition between states of matter, mentioned above. This model of the world holds out wide-ranging implications for the coexistence of man and animal, including the Utopian conception of their kinship and the possibility of a future life of equality.36 2. How does Andrei Platonov fit into the tradition of animal representation sketched out above? What sort of relations between man and animal appear in his writings? It has been noted that the peculiar anthropomorphic conception of animals in his works is associated with a child's perspective .37 Platonov points to the close bond between child and animal when he writes: "a child is man in the beginning, i.e. animal" («ребенок - это человек вначале, т. е. животное»).38 This is why animal anthropomorphism is especially evident in his children's stories. That these stories were written with an adult audience in view becomes clear on closer analysis - for instance of the story "Volchok," where the erotic element reaches far beyond the scope of its boy-narrator.

Freud makes a similar remark in Totem and Taboo : "The relation of the child to animals has much in common with that of primitive man. The child does not yet show any trace of the pride which afterwards moves the adult civilized man to set a sharp dividing line between his own nature and that of all other animals. The child unhesitatingly attributes full equality to animals; he probably feels himself more closely related to the animal than to the undoubtedly mysterious adult..."

He not only has meek human eyes, but also "a human's round pensive head, not at all like a dog's" («не собачья, почти человеческая круглая задумчивая голова»).39 Moreover, the two sometimes see similar dreams. The boy does not regard Volchok as a dog, and for this the dog loves him, with a love that Platonov equates to that of a parent. The boy and the dog are united by one and the same idea: Volchok does not know that he is a male, and will not chase the female dog Chaika, while the boy also understands that truth - not human reproduction - is the key to happiness. In the short story "Korova" ("The Cow"), the boy Vasia feels deep sympathy for a cow that has lost her calf in a railroad accident.40 Her longing for her "son" is described through the boy's eyes. He understands her despair, "which was irreparable and could only increase, because her grief she could console in herself neither with word nor conscience, nor friend, nor a diversion, as man might" («которое было безысходным и могло только увеличиваться, потому что свое горе она не умела в себе утешить ни словом, ни сознанием, ни другом, ни развлечением, как это может делать человек»).41 And he observes how the cow "gazed out into the darkness with her great, swollen eyes, but could not cry with them, to exhaust herself in grief' («глядела во тьму большими налитыми глазами и не могла ими заплакать, чтобы обессилить себя в горе»).42 Even in works that do not feature a child's perspective, anthropomorphized animals often occupy a prominent place. In the novella D?$an43 - to give but one example - men and animals suffer equally, and both are destroyed by the harsh conditions of a pitiless nature. The suffering of animals, told in the mute language of their expressive eyes, is seen even more vividly than that of men. The animal's grief and pain is made all the more profound because it lacks the ability to cry. The camel, dying without food and water, 'looked with its black eyes, like an intelligent, melancholy man" («глядел черными глазами, как умный грустный человек») and closed his eyes because he did not 39 Andrei Platonov, Sobrante , 8 vols (Moscow: Vremia, 2009-11), vol. 6: Sukhoi khleb.

Они действуют, желая утомить свое страдание в борьбе, внутри мертвого тела врага или в собственной гибели (187). They cannot cry, to find in tears and their heart's exhaustion comfort and forgiveness for their enemy. They act, wishing to fatigue their suffering in struggle, in the enemy's corpse or in their own death. On various occasions the protagonist of D^han tries to penetrate into the animals' psyche, to track the patterns of their thought. This recalls Franz Marc's and Filonov's insistence on animals' higher intelligence, and their interest in the animal's peculiar perception of man and Nature.45 When Chagataev encounters a turtle, which "looked wearily with her black tender eyes at a prone man" («томительно глядела черными нежными глазами на лежавшего человека», 135), he tries to divine what must be passing through its consciousness: "Maybe the magical thought of curiosity toward a mysterious, giant man, maybe the sorrow of a slumbering intellect" («Может быть, волшебная мысль любопытства к таинственному громадному человеку, может быть, печаль дремлющего разума», 135). The pensiveness Chagataev sees in the eyes of the turtle conveys to him the dignity of its existence, which needs no human soul to complete it. He imagines they need only "a little help" («небольшая помощь») from man, "but mastery, condescension or pity they do not need..." («но превосходство, снисхождение или жалость им не нужны... », 212). Similarly he tries to intuit the feelings of a hungry dog, whose eye "welled up with the tears of despair" («стояли слезы отчаяния», 151)46 and who "looked at men with greed and sorrow. Her dark, difficult hope was in the wish to eat all men when they die" («жадно и грустно глядела на людей. 44 A. Platonov, Sobrante у vol. 4: Schasthaia Moskva .

In the novels Kotlovan ( The Foundation Pit ) and Chevengur the anthropomorphizing of animals serves very specific ends. In Kotlovan, the anthropomorphic representations of collectivized horses and the blacksmith-bear ironically blur the boundaries between man and animal. The nationalized horses of the kolkhoz "march in step" («ровным шагом») down into the ravine, where they drink "their norm" («в норму»), after which they return "maintaining formation and solidarity among themselves" («не теряя строя и сплочения между собой»), enter the common yard, depositing fodder collected along the way into a single pile, and eat together "collectively at peace without man's care" («организованно смирившись без заботы человека»).47 Voshchev is perplexed by "the serenity of the champing livestock, as though all the horses had been thoroughly convinced of a collectivized meaning of life, while he alone lives and suffers worse than a horse" («душевное спокойствие жующего скота, будто все лошади с точностью убедились в колхозном смысле жизни, а он один живет и мучается хуже лошади», 485). The ironic parallelism draws the reader's attention to the fact that the horses are more organized and more principled than the humans.48 The depiction of the collectivized livestock contrasts with the mournful image of their "private" comrades, dying of hunger in their stalls, because the peasants will not feed them in the face of collectivization. One owner addresses his half-dead horse so: "Then you've died? So be it - I'll be dead soon also, we'll be in peace" («Значит, ты умерла? Ну ничего - я тоже скоро помру, нам будет тихо», 496). We may also recall the ideologically conscientious horse Proletarskaia Sila (The Strength of the Proletariat) from Chevengur ,49 which became accustomed to the rousing cry "Rosa!" and "independently preferred one route over another, and always came out wherever there was need for the armed hand of Kopenkin" («самостоятельно предпочитала одну дорогу другой и всегда выходила туда, где нуждались в вооруженной руке Копенкина»), who "operated without plan or roadmap, but by chance and at the horse's will" («действовал без плана и маршрута, а наугад и на волю коня»).50 Traditionally, the horse 47 Andrei Platonov, Sobrante, vol. 3: Chevengur.

Platonov deliberately appeals to the classic prototype of Cervantes' Rocinante to lampoon the noble image of the horse. The ironic description of that horse's supposedly astonishing "superhuman" intellect operates as a kind of inversion of the pervasive exalted image of the horse, as a creature endowed with the gift of prophecy.54 It is no accident that the horse is treated ironically in exactly those Platonov works where ideological thinking is taken to the limits of the absurd - Kotlovan and Chevengur, Evidently Platonov favored certain humbler creatures over the horse: cows, dogs, turtles, even unsightly rodents. We might also add to this list the symbolically ambiguous fish, associated through its muteness with the kingdom of death, on the one hand, and with truth, on the other.55 The sparrow, as the bird of the poor, is given particular prominence.56 Small creatures are exalted in the short story 'Tiuten', Vitiuten' i Protegalen." Vitiuten considers himself: пророком последней, гонимой, ненавидимой всеми и пожираемой твари - червей мошек, рыбок, травы и тающих облаков, ибо и они пожираются в небе ветром.57 51 There is a wealth of material on the horse motif in avant-garde art, and on Khlebnikov's writings in particular, in the work of J.

Platonov 265 a prophet of the lowest creatures, hounded, despised and devoured by all others - the worm, the gnat, the little fishes, the grass blades and the withering clouds, because they too are devoured up there by the wind. Here, as in many other stories, the paltry creatures are associated with children, since the beatific Vitiuten believes that "the small of the world shall take the world for themselves" («малые мира возьмут себе мир»).58 The little creatures personify a despised, defenseless existence that was especially precious to Platonov.59 The game on the border of human and animal nature is evident in the character of the blacksmith-bear from Kot lo v an , who leads the dekulakif^ation campaign alongside little Nastya. He wields his hammer "humanly" («человечески») and looks forward to a good night whenever he is promised vodka after a day's work. This bear, which has "a wearied proletarian face" («утомленно-пролетарское лицо») and has turned gray from sorrow, because he had lived among people, must be "delivered from oppression as soon as possible" («как можно скорее избавить от угнетения», 500). Clearing the village of kulaks, he is settling the score for various past mistreatments, and - remarkably - is "so enraged he could almost speak" («мог почти разговаривать от злобы», 505). Naturally, the little girl and the bear share a special bond: Ей было хорошо, что животное тоже есть рабочий класс, - а молотобоец глядел на нее как на забытую сестру, с которой он пожировал у материнского живота в летнем лесу своего детства (503). She felt good that the animal is also working class - while the hammerer gazed at her as though she had been a forgotten sister, with whom he fattened at the mother's belly in the summer forest of his childhood. The commingling of the human and the animal principles often assumes an openly parodie character. When Nastya is told that the bear is also pro-Stalin, she responds with "Animals can feel it too!" («Звери тоже чуют!», 502). Those words are echoed by Chiklin in his praise of the activist: "You feel, the classes like an animal" («Ты чуешь классы, как животное», 507). The child and the animal are characterized by the same relentless naïveté in their fight against the kulaks.

Platonova," 240.</page><page sequence="16">266 Hans Günther ambivalent play with metaphor often straddles the comic and the horrific. Like the "organized" horses, the bear is shown to be more conscientious than Voshchev, who is oppressed by the thought that "the animal is working hard, as though it feels the meaning of life nearby, while he stands at the threshold and does not break through the door of the future" («что зверь так трудится, будто чует смысл жизни вблизи, а он стоит на пороге и не пробивается в дверь будущего», 519). The theme of "conscientious" ( so^nateTnye ) animals resurfaces in the novella "Iuvenil'noe more" ("The Juvenile Sea"), where it is suggested that the cows be tended not by shepherds, but by bulls, since "a bull is a brain, if he learns responsibility: subjectively the bull will be a protector of cows, and objectively he will be our shepherd!" («бык это умник, если его приучить к ответственности: субъективно бык будет защитником коров, а объективно - нашим пастухом!»).60 The engineer Vermo, who makes this proposal, appeals to the authority of the animal technician Visokovsky, who believes: что эволюция животного мира, остановившаяся в прежних временах, при социализме возобновится вновь и все бедные, обросшие шерстью существа, живущие ныне в мутном разуме, достигнут судьбы сознательной жизни. ... Пропасть между человеком и любым другим существом должна бьггь перейдена... (379, ellipses mine).61 that the evolution of the animal world, which had come to a halt in the past, will be resumed with the coming of socialism and all the poor, shaggy creatures, now living in hazy reason, will attain the fate of a conscientious life. ... The abyss between man and all other creatures must be crossed. . . At first glance, it appears that the two citations from "Iuvenil'noe more" contradict one another. One seems to refer to a Utopian vision of the future, while the other seems to reflect this vision in the distorted mirror of practical application. The second citation reflects Platonov's wish for an "evolution of the animal world," while the first evidently parodies the official discourse of the times. The goal of this apparent contradiction, as it is so often in Platonov's work, is to direct the reader's attention to the 60 A. Platonov, So branky vol. 2: Efirnyi trakt (Moscow: V remia, 2009), 417-418. 61 I. Makarova points out many parallels between this novella and the views of N. Zabolotsky. (See I.

Platonov 267 grotesque abyss separating the lofty ideals of socialism and its realization in Soviet society. The zootechnician's ideas about the evolution of the animal world is consistent with Platonov's (and Zabolotsky's) conviction that the evolution of life on earth - propelled by social and scientific effort - ought to lead to an integration of the various species of living creatures. Consequently, there is a common thread running through the whole of Platonov's oeuvre that we might call progressive metamorphosis . Even in the early "Rasskaz o mnogikh interesnykh veshchakh" ("Tale of Many Interesting Things"), the brotherly relations between man and animal are presented as a future ideal. Its young hero Ivan Kopchik, founder of the storybook city Novaia Surzha, wants to lodge horses and cows along with humans in the same house: Более зверей и людей не будет - будут и близко друг к дружке телесами и душою. Зверь, брат, тоже большевик, но молчит, потому что человек не велит. Придет время вскоре, заговорят и звери, остепенятся и образумятся ... Это дело человека. Он должен сделать людьми все, что дышит и движется. Ибо в кои-то веки он наложил на зверя гнет, а сам перестал быть зверем. Это потому, что еды мало было. Теперча еды хватит на всех, и зверя можно ослобонить и присоединить к человеку. . .62 There will be no more men and beasts - they will be close to one another in flesh and soul. The beast, brother, is also a Bolshevik, but keeps quiet, because man won't let him. Soon a time will come when the beasts shall speak, get wise and respectable... That is man's business. He must make men of everything that breathes and moves. Because in time immemorial he laid a yoke on the beast, and himself ceased to be a beast. That was because there was little to eat. Nowadays there is enough for everybody, and the beast can be relieved and united with man. . . Ivan's origins likewise stress the connection between man and animal: he was conceived by a "nearly non-existent" («почти не существующий») man-wolf, "cattle and wolf in appearance, but in his soul, his heart and his eyes - a wanderer and a naked beating heart" («по обличию - скот и волк, по душе, по сердцу, по глазам - странник и нагое 62 Andrei Platonov, So branie , vol. 1 : Uso m niv s hits ia Makar.

Although in this story the interactions between men and animals are cast in the conventions of a fairy-tale, or skalka, we may be sure that they closely resemble the author's actual ideas on the subject. The early tale already contains Platonov's principal motifs: the abolition of animal exploitation and the evolutionary "tardiness" of animals. We find an inversion of this idea in the story "Musornyi veter" ('The Trash Wind"), which includes many instances of what we might call regressive metamorphosis , i.e. the inverse vector of the evolution of living creatures. This recalls Hegel's remark concerning Ovid's tendency "to make animals and inorganic forms into a presentation of the degradation of man,"64 because in the Metamorphoses the transformation of humans into animals is equated with "a degradation and a punishment of spiritual existents."65 In "Musornyi veter," "society's defective order leads to the mutation of man," which alters "the form of the human body and all of its familiar physiological and anatomical properties."66 Thoughts about the contrast between human degradation and the nobility of animals appear often in Platonov's Zapisnye kni^hki. For example: "Compared with animals or plants, man is indecent in his behavior" («По сравнению с животными и растениями человек по своему поведению неприличен»).67 Or: "Among animals there are creatures that morally exceed even humans" («Среди животных есть морально даже более высокие существа, чем люди»).68 Several reasons are given in "Musornyi veter" for the "animals' descent from man" («происхождение животных из людей»).69 The case of the wife of the astrophysicist Lichtenberg illustrates the debasing nature of sexual lust70: "The down on her cheeks turned to fur, her eyes sparkled with frenzy, and her mouth was filled with the slaver of greed and concupiscence" («Пух на ее щеках превратился в шерсть, глаза сверкали бешенством и рот был наполнен слюной жадности и сладострастия»).

She is "а beast, the filth of a crazed consciousness" («зверь, сволочь безумного сознания »).71 Other texts make reference to the "animal" nature of the reproductive organs. The protagonist of "Tekhnicheskii roman" ('Technical Romance") is mortified when for the first time in his life he sees on a naked girl: чего он не видел никогда - чужое и страшное, как неизвестное животное, забравшееся греться в теплые теснины человека из погибших дебрей природы... Это существо, непохожее на всю Лиду и враждебное ей, было настолько безумно и мучительно по виду, что Щеглов навсегда отрекся от него, решив любить женщину в одном чувстве и размышлении.72 what he had never seen before - something foreign and frightening, like some unknown animal that had crawled into the warm caverns of human flesh from the perished thickets of nature. . .This creature, so unlike the rest of Lida, appeared so mad and agonizing that Shcheglov once and for all renounced it, resolving from then on to love woman only in spirit and contemplation. And in "Reka Potudan'" ("The River Potudan"), sex instills "animal fear" in the impotent protagonist. He sees a nightmare: что его душит своею горячей шерстью маленькое, упитанное животное, вроде полевого зверька, откормившегося чистой пшеницей. Это животное, взмокая пот от усилия и жадности, залезло ему в рот, в 73 горло... that a small, plump creature, like a field rodent, battened on pure wheat, was smothering him with its hot fur.

The fear of this "madness," so degrading to man, is underpinned by Platonov's conviction that sex must be conquered through reason.74 In "Musornyi veter," however, regressive metamorphosis is also triggered by man's expulsion from a hostile social collective, and this leads to a zoomorphic transformation of his appearance.75 When Lichtenberg, savagely tortured, maimed and thrown into a cesspit, sees a frightened dog76 he understands "that it was formerly a man, reduced by grief and need to the senselessness of an animal" («взмахнула краем плаща и безвучно, с мгновением птицы скрылась от конвоя»).77 Feeding on trash, Lichtenberg himself assumes an animal appearance: "From the disfiguring wounds and pollution his body was covered by a dark infection, resembling eczema, and thick fur grew over it, covering everything up. Bushes of hair also grew in place of his torn-out ears..." («По телу его - от увечных ран и загрязнения - пошла сплошная темная зараза, похожая на волчанку, а поверх ее выросла густая шерсть и все покрыла. На месте вырванных ушей также выросли кусты волос... » (279, ellipsis mine).78 At the prison camp, Lichtenberg is considered "hardly human" («едва ли человек») and "a new possible kind of social animal" («новый возможный вид социального 74 Kh.

A bourgeois, she finds herself an extraneous "social animal" in the Socialist society: "Her long bare arms were covered with thick down, almost fur-like, that had sprung up from her illnesses and shelterless nes s - some kind of ancient force, now revived, transformed her, even while she still lived, into a hidebound animal" ("Длинные обнаженные ноги были покрыты густым пухом, почти шерстью, выросшей ог болезней и бесприютности, - какая-то лревняя, ожившая сила превращала мертвую еще при ее жизни в обрастающее шкурой животное».) (Platonov, Sobranie, vol. 3, 458.) A "protective hide" covers the back of Elisei, one of the group of peasants, who had prepared coffins, to await there the end of their days. (Ibid., 464.) "Poor creatures, covered in fur" also appear in "IuveniTnoe more": it is evident that for Platonov "fur" is one of the fundamental attributes of animal or "animalization."</page><page sequence="21">Man and Animal in the Works of A.

In the end, the hero, who has sacrificed his life to feed starving children, is seen by his wife as "an unfamiliar slaughtered animal" («незнакомое убитое животное»); she imagines it to be "a primordial man, covered with fur, but most likely a large ape, mutilated by someone and dressed, for a laugh, in scraps of human clothing" («первобытный человек, заросший шерстью, но скорее всего это большая обезьяна, кем-то изувеченная и одетая для шутки в клочья человеческой одежды», 288). The policeman, a personification of Nazi ideology, believes the prone body to be "an ape or some other unscientific animal, of no use to Germany" («лежит обезьяна или прочее какое-нибудь ненужное для Германии, ненаучное животное», 288). The only positive metamorphosis in this grim tale befalls Hedwig Wotmann, a communist sentenced to be shot who goes "not to her death, but to a transfiguration" («не в смерть, а в перевоплощение», 284). As if she were a bird, she escapes from the Nazi officers by taking flight - "the flaps of her raincoat fluttered and silently, in a bird's blink, she was lost from view" («взмахнула краем плаща и безвучно, с мгновением птицы скрылась от конвоя», 285). 79 The regressive metamorphoses of "Musornyi veter" suggest that in the fascist "kingdom of appearances" («царстве мнимости», 275) all is not as it seems. In this kingdom of beasts evolution moves in the opposite direction,80 i.e. toward a human degradation, and this results in the animalization of man and a racist society that expels defective "subhumans" as extraneous zoomorphic beings. 79 In Slavic mythology -as elsewhere-the bird is a symbolic equivalent of the soul. 80 The reversal of the evolutionary process, as conceived by Mandeis htam in the poem "Lamarck" (1932), involves the atrophying of the "cultural organs" in the face of a hostile environment: Мы прошли разряды насекомых С наливными рюмочками глаз. Он сказал: природа вся в разломах, Зренья нет - ты зришь в последний раз! Он сказал: довольно полнозвучья, - Ты напрасно Моцарта любил: Наступает глухота паучья, Здесь провал сильнее наших сил. We descended through the ranks of insects / with their swollen snifter eyes. / He said: Nature is in shambles, / vision is over - you shall see no more. / He said: harmony is finished - / Your love of Mozart was in vain: / now a spidery deafness descends, / here is a breakdown greater than all of us.

(Moscow: Khudozhestvennaia literature, 1990), t. 1, 186.)</page><page sequence="22">272 Hans Günther Tapping into the broad spectrum of human-animal relations, explored in the scientific, philosophical, literary, and artistic traditions, Platonov develops his own conception of the interaction - and often interchangeability - of human and animal. In doing so he adapts and recasts traditional motifs to suit his own purposes. There are particularly striking parallels in his works with the representation of animals in the poetry of Zabolotsky and the paintings of Filonov, which are likewise infused with extraordinary compassion and a sense of kinship for the suffering creature - and with the imperative for its liberation. Various kinds of anthropomorphism and zoomorphism, progressive and regressive metamorphoses, and ambiguous metamorphic forms play a prominent role throughout Platonov's works. It is especially striking that in each text the relationship between man and animal is recast from a particular perspective. Thus the backward evolution in "Musornyi veter," for instance, which leads to different forms of negative zoomorphosis, contrasts with Platonov's more typical tendency toward the conflation of human and animal natures. For Platonov, metamorphosis is not simply a metaphor or a symbol: it is a corollary of the author's conviction that the difference between states of matter is strictly one of degree.</page></plain_text>
