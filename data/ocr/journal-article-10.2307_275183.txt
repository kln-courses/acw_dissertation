<plain_text><page sequence="1">STONE IMAGES IN SOUTHERN COLORADO N. W. DONDELINGER and R. M. TATUM DESPITE the familiar abundance of archaeological material in the Southwestern region of the United States, there is a notable pau- city of anthropomorphic images of stone. The most significant of such figures which have come to the attention of the archaeologist are those unearthed by Alfred V. Kidder, at the Pecos ruins in New Mexico.' Inasmuch as no previous reports of stone images in southern Colorado have come to our attention, the purpose of the present article is to di- rect attention to the presence of effigies in this state. In view of the fact that images have been found in New Mexico, it seems plausible that similar objects should exist in southern Colorado. In the course of a survey of the region we have found many indications of an influx of Southwestern culture. Pottery, basketry, and stone artifacts which bear a strong resemblance to those of more southerly tribes have been noted.2 We should expect this, however, since the foot- hills on the southern Colorado line form a continuous geographical northern boundary for the cultural groups of New Mexico.3 Evidences of the extension of Southwestern culture beyond this barrier are found only adjacent to natural passes from New Mexico into Colorado. We are concerned, in this article, with the region adjacent to one of the more easterly passageways through these foothills. High mesas ex- tend discontinuously to the north of the Colorado-New Mexico bound- ary; the largest of the eastern mesas is Mesa de Maya, with an area of approximately two hundred square miles. The western front of Mesa de Maya lies about fifteen miles northeast of Branson, Colorado. This re- gion is adjacent to Emery Gap, the lowest passageway into New Mexico. The mesa, with an altitude of approximately 6,800 feet, towers about a thousand feet above the nearby flats and valleys. It is capped by a thick basalt flow of early Tertiary Age which has withstood the erosive processes of nature a great deal better than the underlying sand- stones and shales.4 As a consequence of its resistance to weathering, a great many rugged cliffs and faces of rock jut outward. Caves and over- hanging rocks are abundant, though often hidden from casual view by the jagged, basalt masses which may be seen on every hand over the slopes leading toward the mesa-top. The mesa and slopes are covered with pinyon pines and with other characteristic, semi-arid vegetation- bush cactus, scrub oaks, cedars, and prairie grasses.

Items of southern culture are quite abundant upon Mesa de Maya and in its environs. It is apparent that man has stalked game in the region for a long time. Folsom and Yuma men hunted in this region, for their points are found from time to time south of the mesa.6 The eastern and southern Indians filtered in and left many cultural remains during wars, hunts, raids, and migrations. Points, knives, scrapers, pendants, shaft tools, flaked rock, smoked caves, fire beds, and tipi rings all may be found in abundance. Some Indian families settled down to an agrarian life, for we find pots, baskets, corn, and grinding imple- ments in the form of manos and metates.7 Many petroglyphs have been incised upon the basaltic rocks.8 Great spirals of rocks and stone en- closures have been built for ceremonial purposes.9 It is from the im- mense caves of Mesa de Maya that stone images are reported to have been recovered. The late Major Henry Abbott, of Trinidad, won the friendship of many Indians and Spanish-Americans during his years of residence in southern Colorado. As a result of his early environment, Major Abbott developed a genuine interest in the archaeology of southern Colorado and acquired a fine collection of accurately classified artifacts, a collec- tion which was enlarged by the generosity of his Spanish-American and Indian friends. Jesus Gonzalez, an aged sheep herder of the Mesa de Maya, was one of the contributors. In the fall of 1935 he gave Major Abbott a much-worn boulder of quartzite upon which was incised a crude face. It was quite evident that the sheep herder, while recognizing this object as unusual, was unaware of its archaeological significance. When questioned as to its origin, he stated that he had discovered it in one of the larger caves of Mesa de Maya. Noting Major Abbott's inter- est, he promised to explore the caves more fully and to bring with him upon a later visit any objects of interest which he might have discov- ered. During the ensuing year, Gonzalez discovered sandstone images strikingly different from the original quartzite boulder. Two of these figures have been made available to us and are considered in the present discussion. A subsequent find in 1936 consisted of a basaltic image of apparent antiquity and a much smaller image of sandstone, together with five pendants and fourteen points. The objects found in 1936 are 5 Renaud, 1931. 6 Renaud, 1934. 7 Dondelinger and Tatum, 1942. 8 Renaud, 1936, R. M.

Because the original quartzite image has been lost since the death of Major Abbott, the following descriptions will include only the four stone images and the materials associated with them. We are indebted to Mrs. Henry Abbott and Mr. George Heap for their hearty cooperation.

VI, a) was hewn from Dakota Sandstone, native to the Mesa de Maya region. This material is of coarse texture, is light in color, and is characterized by a heavy hematite stain. The carving is well defined but does not cover the entire image. No carving had been done upon the greater portion of the base, the center of the back, the posterior portions of the head, the outer edge of the arm, or the right side of the head. Dried and blackened lichens were noted upon these areas. Image A showed the least patination of any of the figures. Image B (P1. VI, b) is of native sandstone from the Lower Cretaceous."0 It is finer in texture than the Dakota Sandstone but is darker in color. This effigy is different in that the anterior carving is all done on a naturally plane surface, and it is unusual in that the area from waist to base is carved apparently to represent a garment with a checkered design. Patination upon the carved areas is so heavy that it tends to obliterate the details. 10 R. M. Tatum, N.D.</page><page sequence="4">62 A MERICA N A NTIQ UIT Y [1, 1944 Image C (P1. VI, c) is the smallest of the group; it also shows the finest detail and skill in workmanship, upon both the posterior and an- terior faces. It is carved from a light-colored, fine-grained, native sand- stone also from local Cretaceous strata. Patination was equally heavy on all faces.

A great deal of labor must have been expended in sculpturing a material of sucl hardness. The figure is characterized by a ridge in relief extending ove the head.</page><page sequence="5">DONDELINGER AND TATUM] STONE IMAGES IN COLORADO 63 The artifacts associated with the two latter images consist of four- teen points and five pendants. The points, of imported material, un- doubtedly represent the crudest workmanship ever encountered by the authors in this area. They are similar in that all have crude depressed bases, blunt apexes, and only one shoulder clearly defined. The three smaller pendants are of highly polished limestone and are similar to the majority of pendants that have been found in southern Colorado. The two larger pendants are of fossilized limestone or petri- fied wood and of crude manufacture. We must attempt to determine the authenticity of these stone im- ages by considering in the first place, their possible origins and, in the second place, their workmanship and appearance. The first possibility is of course that Gonzalez manufactured the images himself. We are acquainted with instances of Spanish-American or Spanish-Indian sheepherders having carved stone images during the last century. Had Gonzalez done the work himself we may well inquire as to where he acquired his pattern. The figures bear no resemblance to Christian images, aside from the position of the hands in figures A and B. It has been suggested that the Order of Penitentes might, at one time have used stone images in their ceremonies. Extensive inquiries made of hermanos mayores, or heads of such groups, have failed to reveal knowledge of such use." Another possibility that comes to mind is that Gonzalez may have found one image and, using it as a pattern, made the others. It will be noted, however, that the figures are quite dissimilar. Still another possibility is that other Spanish-Americans made the im- ages and that Gonzalez discovered them. In this case the same question as to pattern again arises. There seems to be a valid possibility that at least some of the idols are of Spanish-American origin. Dissimilarity of pattern would tend to support this possibility. Since the materials utiliz!ed are of local origin, we must assume that the images are of local manufacture. The pattern may, of course, have originated elsewhere. This assumption is supported by the similarity of the Mesa de Maya images to some of those found at the Pecos Ruins in New Mexico by Kidder,'2 the similarities include the position of the hands on the chest, flat plane of face, and facial expression. It may be that figures similar to the Pecos images formed the pattern for those from Mesa de Maya. In regard to the possibility of Indian origin, it might be well to mention a report that some years ago, a similar stone figure was excavated, with Indian artifacts in a stone shelter in the Chacaquaque canyon, thirty miles north of Mesa de Maya. 11 J. P. Tatum, 1940. 12 Kidder, 1932.</page><page sequence="6">64 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [1, 1944 We may conclude that some or all of the Mesa de Maya images may well be of Indian origin and that in all probability authentic Indian figures served as patterns for them. Until further information is obtained or further discovery is made we cannot be entirely certain of the authen- ticity of these images. But, in any case, the presence of stone images in southern Colorado is unusual and worthy of notice. BIBLIOGRAPHY DONDELINGER, NORMAN W. and ROBERT M. TATUM 1942.
