<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME AFRICAN AFFINITIES OF ARABIAN ROCK ART PAVEL CERVlCEK In this paper, the following common iconographic features of Ara- bian and North African rock art will be briefly discussed: 1) Decoration of bovids and other animals by means of vertical stripes (fig. 1); 2) The so-called Dahthami or Ethiopian-Arabian style of bovid representations (fig. 2); 3) Bovine and ovine bucrania (fig. 3); 4) Ibex representations with hypertrophic horns (fig. 4); 5) " Orants " with spread-out fingers (fig. 5); 6) Nude squatting females (open-legged women) (fig. 6); 7) Sun-like symbols (fig. 7). Bovids are the most frequent motif of the Arabian rock art (Anati 1974: chart facing p. 240). They are often found decorated with one or more vertical stripes running across the body, e.g. at Sha'Ib Musamma, about 30 km north of Hima (id. 1968a: fig. 69; 1968b, II: fig. 7), at Sha'ib Shis'a in the Kaukab Hills (id. 1968b, I: fig. 12), in the Wadi Khaniq (id. 1974: fig. 126) and near A1 Hanakiya, about 150 km north- east of Madinah (CerviiSek 1971a: fig. 1; Courtenay-Thompson 1975: fig. on p. 23 bottom). Sometimes, rock pictures of other animals with analogous decoration are found in Arabia, such as antelopes (Anati 1968a: fig. 26 - Sha'ib Samma) or fat-tailed sheep (id. 1968b, I: fig. 17 left - Sha'Ib Sahi). In Africa, this decoration occurs in rock pictures of bovids on seve- ral rock art sites in Eritrea (Graziosi 1964: fig. 1, pls. XIII, XV, XVI - near Mai Aini; CerviSek 1976: fig. 8 - Hamas6n), in the Hararge pro- vince of Ethiopia (Breuil 1934: fig. 10 - SourrS; Cervicek 1971b: figs. 2, 28 - Laga Oda; Cervicek and Braukamper 1975: fig. 5 - Laga Gafra) as well as in the Nubian Desert (CerviCek 1974: figs. 25, 167, 175, 183, 190, 204, 210, 211, 215, 222, 348), Lower Nubia (Dunbar 1941: fig. 30; Almagro Basch and Almagro Gorbea 1968: figs. 26, 30, 36, 47,</page><page sequence="2">6 PAVEL &amp;RVf&amp;K</page><page sequence="3">SOME AFRICAN AFFINITIES OF ARABIAN ROCK ART 7 54, 64, 85, 97, 221, 222), Upper Nubia (Leclant 1966: fig. 68; id. 1968: fig. 38; Hintze and Hintze 1967: fig. 50; Hellstrom and Langballe 1970: Corpus C passim) and, more rarely, in Southern Upper Egypt (Winkler 1937: figs. 45, 46) and in the Sahara (Huard 1962: figs. 2, 3). Huard (1962: 9) interpreted the vertical stripes across the bodies of these bovids as representing belts for fastening a saddle. Due to the fact that the alleged saddle is not shown in these pictures, it is, however, more pro- bable that the stripes are decorative in character and represent either ornamental belts as those depicted on the so-called standard of Ur dating from the 27th cent. BC at latest (Strommenger and Hirmer 1964: figs. 14, 15), or strings of beads as those worn by a cow engraved on a bronze bell from Moroe pyramid N. 15 (Dunham 1957: fig. 89). In modern times, the Masai in East Africa still decorate their cattle by means of burnt-in stripes (Straube 1964: fig. Ik). When asking about the chronology of the above rock art motif, one can draw a parallel to similar representations of bovids with single decorative belts on stamp-seals from Bahrain and the Faylika Island dating back to approx. 2000 BC (Bibby 1967: 91-92, fig. 4f; 1972: chart pp. 372-373, pl. XX). Bovids and antelopes decorated with seve- ral vertical stripes are scratched on Nubian C-Group pottery dating from about the same period (Firth 1927: 137, fig. 115:94:4 right; 138, fig. 115:98:6 bottom). The so-called Ethiopian-Arabian (Cervicek 1971b: 138 ff.) or Dahthami (Anati 1972: 72 ff.) style of bovid representations shows the body and the legs of the cattle in profile, the fore-legs and the hind- legs are each pooled to one thick line; the hoofs are sometimes stylized to resemble pincers but more often the legs have rounded ends dismis- sing the hoofs entirely. The head, neck and the horns of the animal are shown from the back like with a bovid which turns its head away from the on-looker. Sometimes, the bovids show vertical stripes or other body or horn decorations. This first stage of the style in question develops into more schematic forms: the body of the animal becomes unnaturally long, the homes are curled or degenerate to formless stumps, the head and the neck disappear. In its first stage, also called the stage of Surre after the eponymous site in the Hararge province of Ethiopia near Dire Dawa, this style is found, except on several rock painting sites in the named region (Cervicek 1971b; id. and Braukamper 1975) and on the rock sculpture site of Chabbe in Southern Ethiopia (Anfray 1967), on two sites in the southern Hidjaz, Ta'if and A1 Hanaklya (Howe 1950; Cervicek 1971a, 1971b). In the following schematic stage, the style occurs on rock painting and engraving sites in Somalia (Clark</page><page sequence="4">8 pavel £erv!£ek 1954: text-fig. 35/5-8, pls. 27, 47/3), on rock paintings and engravings in Eritrea (Graziosi 1964: figs. 6, 8, pls. XVI, XXVa, XXVIa; Cervfgek 1976, figs. 8, 32, 34, 36) as well as on many rock painting sites of the Jebel Qara in Central Arabia as the Dahthami style proper according to Anati (1972: 72 ff., figs. 31, 41, 60, 70, 91, 100; 1974: figs. 108, 120, 139, 145, 160, 161, 166, 184, 193, 213, 234, 241, 252, 272, 285) and, sporadically, on rock engraving sites in Upper Egypt, Nubia and throu- ghout the Sahara (Frobenius and Obermaier 1925: pls. 4, 7, 20, 29; Monod 1938: figs. 24, 30, 44, 59, 60; Rhotert 1952: pls. XLIII-XLVI; Cervicek 1974: 185, figs. 33, 63, 127, 169, 204, 215, 216, 335, 440, 469, 502). Thus we can distinguish two main stages of development of the Ethiopian-Arabian style: the first stage " Surre - Hanakiya " is limited to Eastern and Southern Ethiopia and the southern Hidjaz to which it probably spread from Ethiopia where more sites and more techniques of this style are known; the second stage "Dahthami style proper" is best represented in the Jebel Qara in Central Arabia, in Eritrea, Eastern Ethiopia and Northern Somalia; from these centres it probably spread to Southern Upper Egypt, Nubia and the Sahara. It has been possible to date several specimens of this later stage on the basis of their juxta- positions with representations of datable ships and symbols as belonging to the Graeco-Roman Period (Cervi&amp;k 1974: 185-186, figs. 127, 502). Anati dated the Dahthami style proper in Central Arabia to his Early Hunting and Pastoral Period with a tentative absolute date ranging from 6000 to 4000 BC. Rock pictures in the Ethiopian-Arabian style or other bovid repre- sentation sometimes include representations of bovine bucrania, e.g. at Qahra (Anati 1974: figs. 159, 161, 166) and west of the Dahthami wells (id. 1972: fig. 48) in the Jebel Qara in Central Arabia. In most cases, however, bovine and ovine bucrania are represented as an inde- pendent motif in the rock art of Central Arabia (Anati 1972: fig. 45 top right; id. 1974: fig. 234 bottom - ovine bucrania) and especially in Eritrea (Cervi&amp;k 1976: 252, figs. 3-5, 9-18, 20-25, 27-28, 30-31, 33, 35) where they are associated with late Ethiopian-Arabian bovid repre- sentations and can be dated by analogy to bronze objects of the same shape and metal marks with the same symbols to the Pre-Aksumite Period 2, i.e. to the 5th-4th cent. BC according to Fattovich (Cervteek 1976: 253; Fattovich 1977 and personal communication). In Arabia, an ox-head has been discovered in the Temple II of Barbar in Bahrain dating from 2200-2000 BC (Blob 1955: fig. 1; Bibby 1972: 372-373) and, later on in the 1st cent. BC to the 1st cent. AD, Sabaean stelae and reliefs were sometimes framed in a border of bucrania (Brit. Mus.</page><page sequence="5">SOME AFRICAN AFFINITIES OF ARABIAN ROCK ART 9 nos. 135, 585; Nielsen 1927: figs. 62, 63). The frequent Sabaean symbol group, called by Grohmann (1915: 19 ff.) " Blitzbiindel und Doppel- griffel " (bundle of lightnings and double slate-pencil) could be explained as a bucranium with an H-shaped schematic anthropomorph with raised arms as if worshipping the former - rock paintings in the Hararge pro- vince of Ethiopia show these anthropomorphs less conventionalized facing bovids in the Ethiopian-Arabian style and sunlike symbols (Cer- vicek 1971b: figs. 38, 40-47). The ibex was the most important symbolic animal of the ancient southern Semites (Grohmann 1915: 56 ff.) and one of their gods (Niel- sen 1927: 192). In Sabaean reliefs, the ibex sometimes shows hyper- trophic horns (Grohmann 1915: fig. 163; Brit. Mus. 135, 585). This fact is anticipated by ibex representations with a horn hypertrophy in the rock art of Central Arabia (Anati 1972: figs. 35-37), the Hidjaz (Rhotert 1938: figs. pp. 216/2, 223/2, pls. 25, 28; Howe 1950: fig. 2), Upper Egypt and Lower Nubia (Cervicek 1974: 187, figs. 17, 106 bot- tom left, 167 left, 174, 284 bottom left, 313) and especially in the Negev Desert where the ibex is a predominant motif (Anati 1963a: 180 ff.; id. 1963b). According to Anati, most of these ibex representations belong to the socalled Negev style within the Middle Hunting and Pastoral Period I and II (3rd and 2nd mill. BC) (Anati 1972: 157 and chart facing p. 156). As to the so-called orants with spread-out fingers, they are rather frequent in the rock art of the Jebel Qara (Anati 1968a: figs. 19 top, 29, 30, 35, 36, 76, 77, 82, pls. XI, XII; id. 1968b, I: fig. 17; id. 1974: figs. 151, 167-170, 195, 196, 210, 237-239, 261-263, 274-277) and recur as a rare motif in Upper Egypt (Cervicek 1974: figs. 296, 393, 398, 402). In Arabia, they belong after Anati to the early Literate or Pre- Literate Periods in the late 2nd and the 1st mill. BC (1972: 156) but in Upper Egypt some of them seem to be of much earlier date as they correspond to potmarks of the late 4th mill. BC Naqada culture and the Nubian A-Group (Cervteek 1974: 144-145). In Bahrain, such a figure was found carved in a plinthstone for a statue dating from about 2000 BC and its resemblance to a motif of the Scandinavian Bronze Age engravings noted (Glob 1955: 191, fig. 7). Similar rock pictures in the Siberian rock art have been convincingly interpreted by Okladnikov (1966: 136, fig. 43) as shamans in praying posture. Nude squatting females or open-legged women in Anati's termi- nology are rarely represented in the Jebel Qara (Anati 1968a: figs. 31, 84b; 1974: figs. 128, 157). Prof. Ryckmans identified one of these</page><page sequence="6">10 PAVEL CERVICEK females by means of a juxtaposed Sabaean inscription as Ethiopian woman, the inscription dating this rock engraving to the Sabaean period (Ryckmans 1957). Anati also dates some of these representations to his Literate Period (1968a: 69, 126-127), others to the 2nd mill. BC Middle Hunting and Pastoral Period I (1972: 157; 1974: chart facing p. 84). Early 2nd mill. BC seals from Bahrain show a similar motif (Mortensen 1971: 393, fig. 8). In Africa, this motif is paralleled spora- dically in the Saharan rock art; it abounds on the rock engraving site of Udei el Chel south-west of Mizdah in Tripolitania where, according to Graziosi, a cult of fecundity was practised over a long space of time, from the neolithic Bovidian Period until the end of the Camel Era or even more recent times (1971). The so-called sun-like symbols are the last category of Arabian rock art with African affinities to be mentioned here. In contrast to the well-known ancient Arabian symbol of the sun-goddess Sams which is a plain disc (Grohmann 1915: 37-44), sun-like symbols in the Jebel Qara rock art are circles filled with a dot, a stroke or a cross (Anati 1968a: fig. 29; 1972: figs. 84, 88). Anati has dated them to Islamic, Pre-Islamic and Pre-Literate Periods (1968a: 60, 1972: 126, 132). Ana- logous symbols are wide-spread in the entire Near East as camel brands and graffiti (Field 1952), they recur in the rock art of the Horn of Afri- ca (Clark 1954: pl. 28; Cervicek 1971b: figs. 23, 29, 38, 41, 43, 47), Upper Egypt (Cervicek 1974: figs. 443, 455), Nubia (Hellstrom and Lan- gballe 1970: Corpus X), the Sahara (Monod 1938: figs. 5, 14, 34). In Nubia, the cross-filled circle appears on the C-Group pottery (Cervicek 1975: 192) and still plays a role in the Coptic magic (Lexa 1923: fig. 71). This symbol is characteristic of the Bronze Age rock art of southern Scandinavia where it is considered to be connected with a solar cult (Behn 1967: 99, fig. 10). If we try to summarize the results of this short investigation, they can be outlined as follows: in the 3rd and 2nd millenia BC, rock pictu- res of decorated and stylized bovids and those of bovine bucrania seem to reflect a dominant position of cattle in the ideology of the popula- tions in Arabia, Ethiopia and the Sahara. At that period, a special Ethiopian-Arabian style of bovine representations developed in Eastern and Southern Ethiopia and the southern Hidjaz and spread to Eritrea, Somalia, Central Arabia, Upper Egypt, Nubia and the Sahara. This fact may be echoed by the existence of the god Taur (bull) in the old Semitic religion (Nielsen 1927: 192) and by the use of bovine bucrania in the ancient Arabian art. At approximately the same time, a style of ibex representations with hypertrophic horns appeared in the Negev</page><page sequence="7">SOME AFRICAN AFFINITIES OF ARABIAN ROCK ART 11 Desert and the Hidjaz from where it expanded to Central Arabia, Up- per Egypt and Lower Nubia. The importance of ibex also recurs in the ancient Arabian art and religion. The so-called orants with spread- out fingers, the open-legged women and the sun-like symbols, occuring in the rock art of Arabia and North Africa, possibly reflect shamanic practices, cults of human fecundity and of the sun respectively, practised by the prehistoric populations of these regions.
