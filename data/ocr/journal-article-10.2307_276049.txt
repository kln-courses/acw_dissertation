Recent years have seen a tremendous advance in our knowledge of the prehistoric cultures of Andean South America, but to date the lowland area has not received similar attention. Our knowledge of it is limited to sporadic and widely separated sites documented with varying de- grees of incompleteness and unreliability. In this paper, presented as a doctoral dissertation at Yale University, George Howard has attempted to bring some order into the jumble of material and to draw some tentative conclusions about the temporal and spatial relationships of the ceramic types. No attempt was made to deal with any but the ce- ramic material, it alone being abundant enough and suffi- ciently widely distributed for comparative study under the present conditions. Use was made of all the museum collec- tions in this country, as well as the available literature. The unevenness of the data required the application of special methods of analysis in order to arrive at some degree of standardization and comparability. Believing that "pro- cedures of artifact analysis, description, and definition which are behavioristic should yield results of greater valid- ity when applied to the data than many of those previously used which were frequently intuitive," Howard used the concepts of "style," "trait," and "complex." "By ceramic style is meant the aggregate of the pottery traits which dis- tinguish a collection as a unit. Ideally each style treated in this paper should represent a homogeneous population from the standpoint of statistical theory.... The trait, which is any observable characteristic which is meaningful in com- paring and contrasting various artifacts, is the minimal component of the ceramic style. A trait complex is a char- acteristic grouping of traits occurring within a style and a style may contain a series of complexes. The component traits of a complex have a unity in time and space" (pp. 14-15). For example, the Marajo style was found to share the following traits and complexes with the Maraca style: "Napo Anthropomorphic complex (anthropomorphic jar, anthropomorphic features in relief, polychrome painting, painted designs upon and between relief, wide and narrow painted linear elements, and painted lines alternately straight and sharply curved and angled), globular jar, burial urn, area in solid red, double painted line design, and inci- sion." Lowland South America was divided into four geographi- cal divisions to facilitate the analysis. These are: (1) the Orinoco and West Indies, including British Guiana; (2) Am- azonia; (3) Lowland Bolivia; (4) the Southeast, embracing lowland Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and southern and eastern Brazil. Each of these is discussed separately in the report in terms of styles, traits, and complexes. At the conclusion of the analyses of the individual styles of each geographical division, the interrelationships of the traits and complexes constituting each style with those of each of the other styles is given in outline form, as in the example quoted above. It is to be regretted that some means could not have been found to include the series of tables "listing the traits diagnostic of the styles and their distribution among- the styles of each of the four major areal divisions," wbich was contained in the original paper. As it is, the reader must sift these data out of the text, and it is difficult to judge how large a percentage of the total traits of each style the number shared with the other styles actually is. By using this technique of comparative analysis, Howard was able to divide the styles within each of the four geo- graphical areas into two groups characterized primarily by the presence or absence of painting, or in the case of Amazonia, of monochrome or polychrome painting. These are: for the Orinoco, Early (Early Ronquin, Cedros, May- aro, Los Barrancos, La Cabrera, Cuevas) and Late (Arau- quin, Late Ronquin, Valencia); for Amazonia, Polychrome (Napo, Mirakanguera, Cunany, Maraca, Maraj6) and Santarem; for Lowland Bolivia, Painted (Lower Mound Velarde, Upper Mound Velarde, Mound Hernmarck) and Unpainted (Mound Masicito, Rio Palacios, Chimay); for the Southeast, Arroyo Malo and El Cerrillo. Howard's findings may be summarized as follows: There is a much closer resemblance between the Early and Middle Period styles of the Orinoco and West Indies and the Polychrome styles of the Amazon than between any other combination of styles in the two areas, arguing for the possibility that the two were contemporary. Since the date- able pottery so far recovered from the Guianas belongs to a later period, it seems likely that contact took place at the headwaters of the Orinoco and Negro Rivers. The wide dis- tribution of urn burial over the rest of the continent leads to the inference that it entered Venezuela from the south and in the Late Period. There are striking analogies between the Late Period styles of the Orinoco and Santarem, among them the presence of siliceous spicules in the paste, but Howard does not feel that this necessarily indicates diffu- sion rather than independent development. There is a clear- cut relationship between the Polychrome Division of the Amazon and the Painted Division of Lowland Bolivia. Urn burial here is apparently also intrusive from Amazonia. Since the incised styles of Lowland Bolivia show no specific relationship to known Amazonian styles, it seems possible to conclude that "a complex of traits of painted decoration unaccompanied by incision entered Lowland Bolivia from Amazonia and was assimilated into the local styles." In the Southeast, the Arroyo Malo style shows possible in- fluence from the Amazonian Polychrome styles, while the affiliations of the El Cerrillo style are with the Mizque In- cised style of Bolivia. "Reviewing these distributional relationships for the total area it appears probable that the Amazonian region is the center of dispersal of certain traits such as urn burial and the complex of traits of polychrome decoration which diffused into Lowland Bolivia and the Southeast probably in the case of the former. by inci!ion. Per- 66</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 67 haps the polychrome decoration of the Orinoco and West Indies area originated in Amazonia, but if so, it underwent a certain degree of modification.... The history of the trait incision over the total area is almost impossible to re- construct but several suggestions may be offered. In view of its absence in the Painted styles of Lowland Bolivia and in the Arroyo Malo style of the Southeast, it is suggested that it is a later development within the Amazonian area than polychrome painting. Thus, contrary to general opinion, the polychrome unincised pottery of Cunany might very well represent an early style. That incision diffusedl into the neighboring areas from Amazonia seems probable by virtue of its wide distribution in Amazonia and the high degree of elaboration it has received in at least one of the styles of this area, Maraj6" (p. 86). It is unfortunate, as Howard himself points out, that the Amazon area, which seems from his analysis to be of such great significance in the development of lowland ceramic styles, is the least known of the four divisions. He has made a valiant effort to draw historical conclusions from the meager data at his disposal and has arrived at some inter- esting hypotheses. Only extensive archeological fieldwork can establish their validity, together with that of the methodology employed to reach them. BETTY J.
