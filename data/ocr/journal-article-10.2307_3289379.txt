<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME ANCIENT MANIFESTATIONS OF THE RELIGIOUS IMPULSE' By HUBERT McNEILL POTEAT Wake Forest College There is no field, I think, which offers the student richer divi- dends of satisfaction and inspiration in return for the investment of time and diligence than the history of religion. It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss so vast a theme, but rather to point out certain types of religious belief which were widely held in ancient times and which, in point of fact, are by no means extinct even in this advanced period. The only originality to which I may possibly lay claim is to be found in the assembling of several of these types in the space of a brief article - so brief, indeed, as to preclude a really adequate discussion of any one of them. It is a commonplace of anthropology that, with two or three negligible exceptions, all races of men in all times have bowed down and worshiped; not always worthily, but usually in sin- cerity. A certain wise Frenchman has truly said that man is in- curably religious. Psychologically, then, all religions are identical, since they spring from a universal need. But conceptions of deity have varied all but incredibly and have assumed an in- finity of forms. It will be observed that some of the forms dis- cussed herein are not sharply distinct from one another. In reality, the more one studies the religions of mankind, the more clearly one perceives that there is hardly to be found a single widespread form of religious belief which has not been influ- enced in some degree by other and sometimes vastly different faiths and creeds. 1 Read at the Sixth Annual Meeting of the Southern Section of the Clas- sical Association of the Middle West and South, Washington and Lee Uni- versity, April 28-30, 1927. 573</page><page sequence="2">574 THIE CLASSICAL JOURNAL It is obviously impossible to enter upon even the briefest dis- cussion of any considerable number of manifestations of the re- ligious impulse. I shall, therefore, present nine, and in bare out- line. First, Anthropomorphism. It is, I think, unquestionably true that of all the heresies which have held sway over the minds and hearts of men, anthropomorphism is at once the most ancient, the most popular, and the most fatal. It has appeared in multifarious forms among all races of all periods, and its power is still mighty among large sections of the inhabitants of this planet. St. Paul's view of it may be found in his Epistle to the Romans 1:20-25; and, indeed, idolatry is its most widespread type. The untutored savage, groping in darkness after some worthy object of worship, hits upon a likeness of himself, magnified, perhaps, or hideously distorted, the better to inspire terror. He is intellec- tually incapable of bowing down to the invisible: his gods must be at hand - within the sight of his eyes and the touch of his fingers. As civilization advances we find statues and images - still in human form - worshiped, not as gods and goddesses, but as representations of the divine ones who appear in person only rarely. The popular religion of Greece and Rome is a case in point. The immortal gods dwelt on Mt. Olympus, or in favorite islands and forests and valleys, and the people did them reverence through their images in the temples. But the images were thought to be more or less faithful portraits of the gods, who were simply men and women gifted with the ability to fly through the air and, as Horace puts it, "knowing not the chill of death." Moreover, no student of Homer and Vergil needs to be reminded that the deities of ancient Greece and Rome mingled freely with men, not always invisibly, and were moved by envy, lust, ambition, and rage, as men were, but in a far greater degree. It should be noted, in passing, that these childish imaginings were not for a moment accepted by the philosophers and sages of any ancient nation. Socrates, Plato, Cicero, Zoroaster, Confucius, no more subscribed to the popular superstitions of their respective</page><page sequence="3">ANCIENT TYPES OF RELIGION 575 periods than we do. For example, we read in the Tusculan Dis- putations: "I do not believe that the gods delight in ambrosia or nectar, or in the cup of eternal youth, nor do I credit Homer when he babbles of Ganymede, carried off to the skies on account of his beauty, to serve drinks to Jove. Homer, in short, invented all this and transferred human attributes to the gods. I should prefer to implant divine attributes in ourselves." Indeed, it may be said that there has always been and is now a conception of deity cherished by the wise and enlightened which differs very widely from that held by the ignorant masses. During the later years of the fourth century B.c. a certain Euhemerus propounded the theory that the numerous divinities who were said to reign from Mt. Olympus were, in reality, men who, in some past age, had been mighty warriors or great ben- efactors of mankind and after their death were worshiped by the people out of gratitude. It is interesting to find a notion substan- tially the same among certain Australian tribes of our own time. An eminent scientist tells us that they worship "magnified, un- dying men who lived long on earth and then went to their own place, whence they watch men and their conduct, but take little part in their affairs." Anthropomorphism is widely prevalent today among the ignor- ant and superstitious. No person who has attended certain types of "camp-meeting" will ask proof of this statement. The deity is vociferously pictured as a big man with a long beard, a fearful grouch, and an unerring aim with thunderbolts. It is dishearten- ing, moreover, to find such puerile ideas present in the minds of many persons who ought to know better. I read not long ago of a popular novelist who dared God to kill him as a sort of sporting proposition. And I have heard on unimpeachable authority that certain itinerant evangelists inform business men in their audi- ences that if they insist upon keeping their stores open during the hour of morning service, Almighty God will strike them dead. Anthopomorphism? Certainly; and impudent and hideous blas- phemy, as well. It should be remarked, in closing this portion of the discussion,</page><page sequence="4">576 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL that many instances of anthropomorphism in the Bible are ob- viously figurative. For example, "The Lord is a mighty man of war," "The Lord hath made bare his holy arm," "Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him," and the like. Let us turn now to the second manifestation of the religious impulse, Theriomorphismn or Zoi3theism, the worship of deity in animal form. One thinks immediately of the religion of ancient Egypt, with its menagerie of horrible beast-gods - Thoth, Anubis, Bast, Set, Apis, and the rest. Apis, indeed, made such a lasting impression upon the Children of Irsael, during their so- journ in Egypt, that, while Moses was receiving the Law on Mt. Sinai, they compelled Aaron to make them a golden image of that deity and fell down and adored it, to the horror of Moses. One of the most widespread forms of theriomorphism is totem- ism - the grouping of families and clans and tribes around some central object of worship, which is usually set up on a pole and is in most cases an animal. The totem poles of the far North, with their grotesque and hideous carvings of impossible beasts, are to be seen in any of our large museums. Among the American Indians the influence of totemism has always been wide and profound. I paraphrase here a passage from one of the leading authorities on Indian lore. The Red Man, brought into constant contact with the animals of the forest and prairie, observed that they possessed greater cunning than him- self, that their hunting instinct was much more sure, that they seldom suffered from lack of provisions, that they were more swift of foot. In short, he considered them to be his superiors in those faculties which he most coveted and admired. The fox was proverbial for craft, the wildcat for stealth, the bear for stupidity, the owl for cryptic wisdom, the deer for swiftness. In each of these attributes the several animals to which they be- longed appeared to the savage as more gifted than himself, and so deeply was he influenced by this seeeming superiority that if he coveted a certain quality he would place himself under the pro- tection of the animal or bird which symbolized it. Again, if a tribe or clan possessed any special characteristic, such as fierce-</page><page sequence="5">ANCIENT TYPES OF RELIGION 577 ness or cunning, it was usually called by its neighbors after the bird or beast which symbolized its character, or it might even bestow such an appellation upon itself. After the lapse of a few generations the members of a tribe would regard the animal whose qualities they were supposed to possess as their direct ancestor (thereby becoming, of course, frightful heretics), and so would consider that all the members of his species were their blood relations. I may add that this writer goes so far as to suggest that the owl which accompanied Pallas Athene was merely a survival of an earlier totemic personification. And a friend and former student of mine informed me a short time ago that he had re- cently heard a competent scholar advance the theory that such epithets as (owltgS and y?axilontg were of theriomorphic, or totem- ic, origin. I read, not long ago, certain curious details of totemic theory and practice among the Australian Bushmen. It appears that they bow in deepest reverence before Wallunqua - a fearsome crea- ture, half man and half snake, and thirty miles long. At his wor- ship, the orthodox build a mound of sand fifteen feet long, shaped like an overturned canoe and rendered smooth by the pouring of water over it. Then a black, wavy line is painted around the edge of the mound to represent Wallunqua. This line is next gently and reverently brushed with twigs until it disappears; whereupon the worshipers depart, only to sneak up to the mound after night- fall and savagely hack it to pieces. These enlightened Bushmen live under a matriarchate, and the family names of the women are the names of animals or plants, that is to say, of the totems of the family. The most popular are the frog, the kangaroo, the emu, the wildcat, the gum tree, the lizard, the beetle, and the snake. No man may marry a girl whose totem is the same as his mother's. It is interesting and instructive to compare with these partic- ulars the deep reverence paid by the worshipers of Aesculapius to serpents, which were regarded as living symbols of renovation and of the renewal of life. Moreover, in ancient Egypt the ser- pent figured largely in religious symbology.</page><page sequence="6">578 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL Among many ancient nations animals and birds were wor- shiped, not as gods, but as the confidants of the gods, or as incar- nations of the Divine spirit. Tacitus informs us that the Germans were in the habit of "making trial of the prophecies and the warn- ings of horses," which were kept at public expense in groves and forests, were not permitted to work, and were driven in sacred chariots while the king or priest walked at their heads and "listened to their whinnyings and neighings." The incredible Roman practice of watching the flight of birds and peering at the viscera of slain sheep, in the belief that the will of the gods would thus be ascertained, is, of course, another case in point. Livy's charming tale, with which you are all fam- iliar, about the means by which the gods pointed out Romulus as their choice for the honorable distinction of founder of the city of Rome, supplies a further illustration. Apis has already been mentioned. He differed from the other theriomorphic gods of ancient Egypt in being regarded as the temporary incarnation of the deity of fecundity. The bull which represented the god must possess certain very particular mark- ings, and such animals were not always to be found. When one appeared, it was ecstatically hailed by the populace, pastured and groomed and pampered most lavishly, and loudly bewailed at death. The sacred bull appears also in Mithraism, that noble and beautiful religion of the ancient Persians which so stubbornly resisted the onward march of Christianity. There are some ethnologists who insist that the charming beast fables, found among all peoples, of all periods of history, are of theriomorphic, or zo6theistic, origin. For example, Joel Chandler Harris, author of the Uncle Remus stories, explains the invariable supremacy of Brer Rabbit in his tales by remark- ing that the rabbit was "the great central figure and wonder- worker of African mythology." It may as well be said, by way of concluding this section, that theriomorphism still has its adherents among the so-called edu- cated classes. There are many persons who shudder with fear at the long-drawn howl of a dog in the dead of night; who re-</page><page sequence="7">ANCIENT TYPES OF RELIGION 579 gard the sedate march of a black cat across the road in front of them as a most evil omen; and who, probably without knowing it, pay tribute to sound Roman tradition in investing with sundry unholy implications the furtive plaints of flitting striges. We come now to Fetichism, a widespread form of semi-reli- gious observance which has existed in amicable association with practically every type of religion, ancient and modern. The fetich is, in brief, a mascot, or lucky piece; and fetichism may be defined as a belief in the supernatural powers and influence of certain material objects. These objects, even if one looks only casually into the matter, will be found to represent an amazing variety, ranging from the gruesome equipment of the savage witch- doctor to the swastika watch charm of the up-to-date American. Among uncivilized races the fetich is watched over and pam- pered and propitiated by its owner only as long as it brings him prosperity and good fortune. But if the rains fail to appear, or if his wives prove unfaithful, or if his enemy flourishes, it is cast forth with contumely and curses. The notion seems to be that the fetich is the temporary abode of an imprisoned and subservient spirit, which, if its beneficent ministries are long enough con- tinued, may ultimately be elevated by its proud possessor to the dignity of godhead. The North American Indian has been referred to in the preced- ing section. Were I merely to enumerate the fetiches held in high repute by him, this paper would be prolonged beyond endurance. I mention only one - for its classical flavor. Among the Apaches, one of the most potent fetiches is lightning-riven wood. Pieces of such wood are shaved thin, carved into a rough resemblance to the human figure, and marked with lines to represent the light- ning. I think the most interesting example of fetichism among the Greeks and Romans was the Palladium - that magic statue of Pallas which, during the reign of Ilus, descended precipitately but benignly into Troy,, where it was zealously and successfully guarded until a certain fatal night during which the wily Ulysses</page><page sequence="8">580 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL and the mighty Diomed filched it from its sacred precincts, and the proud city of Priam began to totter toward its doom. The Roman child received, on the dies lustricus, not only his praenomen, but a choice lot of all sorts of trinkets and ornaments, called collectively crepundia, and worn on a string around the neck. The crepundia was the ancient equivalent of the modern infant's rattle, but it (or they, for the word, of course, is plural) discharged, in addition, a function of vastly higher importance, to wit, the protection of the child against fascinatio - the evil eye. Not content, however, with this congeries of magical instru- ments, the Roman paterfamilias bedecked his young hopefuls with yet another potent fetich - the bulla - which was con- structed of two concave pieces of gold (if he could afford it), fastened together by a spring and containing an amulet which materially assisted the crepundia in the serious business of de- fense against the nefarious oglings of the wicked. Many other particulars will doubtless suggest themselves to you, such as the eagles of the army, the so-called sacred vessels of the temples, and the Cybele meteorite, brought to Rome in 204 B.c. Before we adopt an attitude of supercilious contempt of fetich worshipers, let us be very certain that we ourselves are carrying no lucky pennies, esteeming no day above another, playing no favorite numbers, hiding in our pockets no "lef' hin' foot of a grave-yard rabbit," wearing no swastikas, and, following no "hunches." The theory and practice of the Tabu, the opposite of fetichism, are most interesting, but time presses and I proceed to the next manifestation of the religious impulse, Animism, the worship of ghosts, demons, and spirits. This is invariably a religion of fear, of endless propitiation and bargaining, of exact and meticulous ritual; and I read with a gasp of astonishment the statement made recently by an authority that there are now on this little planet 136,325,000 animists. I mention two of the most common types of animism. First, the religion of most savage tribes, with the inevitable medicine man. The chief function of this rather hor- rible personage is to ward off, by certain abstruse incantations,</page><page sequence="9">ANCIENT TYPES OF RELIGION 581 the onset of hostile goblins which, unless constantly and hand- somely pacified, would cause pestilence, famine, marital infidelity, barrenness, and a thousand other calamities, and then gibber in fiendish glee over the wreckage. It will be observed that fetichism plays an important part in animistic systems. Second, ancestor worship. Among the Romans, wax masks (imagines) of distinguished forbears were carefully kept in the alae, and at funerals were donned by mummers and worn in the procession. We learn from Servius that, at the obsequies of Mar- cellus, nephew of Augustus, 600 imagines were thus displayed. In modem China and Japan, as everyone knows, ancestors must be propitiated in various ways, must on no account be neglected or forgotten, and must be consulted on all matters of importance. Lack of time prevents the citation of further examples. Pantheism next claims our attention. There have been, of course, many definitions of the term and numerous and more or less widely differing theories about the doctrine. I am not here concerned, for instance, with Spinoza's theistic pantheism (faith in God as an infinite and eternal reality, in whose infinity the temporal, finite world is swallowed up - acosmism), nor with Haeckel's atheistic pantheism (the conception of the universe as a vast unity in which deity is lost - pancosmism), but with the more popular doctrine so widely held in ancient times (and, in a considerably smaller degree, today), namely, that God is all; that God and nature are inseparable and identical; that God is not transcendent but immanent; that everything partakes of the nature of God. Among the discoveries at Oxyrynchus was part of a lost "gospel," containing this sentence: "Jesus saith: Where- soever they may be, they are not without God; and where there is one alone, even thus am I with him. Raise the stone, and there thou shalt find me; cleave the wood, and I am there." Pantheism in its simplest form is nothing more nor less than nature worship, and as such it is found among all savage and many civilized peoples. Various potencies and forces of nature have been worshiped by men, but I suppose there is no doubt that of all the objects, animate and inanimate, before which human</page><page sequence="10">582 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL souls have bowed in veneration, the sun has had far and away the largest number of votaries. Among more backward and prim- itive races he was (and is) adored as a god; among more highly civilized nations, he was revered as a type or symbol of divinity; among others still, he was personified and called Mithra, Helios, Ra, etc. On December 30, 1926, the newspapers carried an account of a rather startling essay presented the day before to one of the sections of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The author was a distinguished Russian archaeologist, and his subject was "Historiometry." Briefly, he advanced the theory that world history is guided neither by Providence nor by the will of man, but that all human beings are slaves of the sun and its vast electrical power. His researches into sunspot records, extended through Chinese, Arabian, Armenian, and other ancient annals, led him to the opinion that there is a close and vital connection between the gigantic disturbances on the sun and the great upheavals of earth history. He reports finding the eleven-year cycles divided as follows in their effect on human life: Three years of minimum excitability among mankind, two years of growing excitability, three years of maximum excitabil- ity (through which - Heaven help us! - we are now passing), and finally three years of decline to the minimum which closes the cycle. He concludes: "The existence of a dependence of the behavior of humanity upon sunspot activity should be considered and established." We learn from the Bible that in his old age Solomon turned to certain false gods, including Milcom and Ashtoreth. Now Milcom was an Ammonite sun god, and Astoreth a moon goddess wor- shiped by the Phoenicians. It is at least possible that the two great brazen pillars, Jachin and Boaz, which stood, we are told, in the "porch" of the Temple, were imitations of similar adornments of the temple of Venus at Paphos on the island of Cyprus, built about a hundred years before the marvelous sacred edifice on Mount Moriah. Tyrian workmen erected both buildings, and the two pillars at the entrance of the Cyprian structure are said to</page><page sequence="11">ANCIENT TYPES OF RELIGION 583 have been decorated with representations of the sun and moon. The fact that Solomon's apostasy occurred many years after the completion of the Temple does not, it seems to me, affect the probability of the parallelism. It would be interesting to enter here into certain other details, but considerations of space make it necessary to proceed to the next manifestation of the religious impulse, Polytheism. There is no question in my own mind, though the matter has been warmly debated, that polytheism was the logical result of pantheism - that the worship of a heterogeneous congeries of gods and goddesses grew directly out of nature worship, through the simple and beautiful ministry of personification. In other words, all the forces, potencies, aspects, phases of nature were worshiped, among practically all ancient nations (and are still worshiped among many modern tribes low in the scale of civil- ization), under the name of a god or a goddess who presided over this force or that, this aspect or that, and who, in his or her attributes, was a faithful portrait of the force or aspect. For example, it is possible, as has already been pointed out, to find a sun god almost anywhere one searches for him. Likewise, wis- dom, beauty, fruitfulness, moisture, violence, thunder, mildew, and a hundred others, were personified and worshiped and feared and propitiated. Propitiation, indeed, is the most important religious exercise in polytheistic systems; for, with so large a number of divinities, many will inevitably represent hostile potencies. These, then, must ever and anon be appeased by the strict observance of an elaborate ritual, together with divers sacrifices - offered with a frightfulness which increases with the decrease of culture and en- lightenment. The idea that deity and nature are inseparable is, obviously, responsible for the presence in many religions of water nymphs, mountain sprites, tree spirits; a whole host of kindly pro- tectors of the farmer and his flocks and crops, the householder and his pantry and hearth, the sailor, the merchant, the soldier, the hunter.</page><page sequence="12">584 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL Even the ancient Hebrews seem to have come to believe in one God at a rather late period in their history. They were fre- quently wavering and irresolute in their allegiance to him, and sometimes they forgot him entirely, and went after the false gods of various neighboring peoples. Moreover, when they had been scourged back to the true path by their prophets and priests, they still believed in the existence of other gods than their own. We read with astonishment in the Eighty-Sixth Psalm: "Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works." Jonah, ordered by Jehovah to go to Nineveh and preach, "rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord." In other words, Jonah labored under the popular delusion that Jehovah was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their descendants, and had no jurisdiction outside his own borders - foreign coun- tries being presided over by their own deities, who resembled Jehovah, but were inferior to him in power. We come now to Phallism, the worship of the principle of gen- eration and fertility. It is not in the least strange that primitive, unphilosophic men elevated this principle into the dignity of god- head. They looked about them and saw, first of all, birth and growth and development - in nature, among animals, within their own stockades and dwellings. There must be, they said, some mighty and mysterious power which causes this universal fruitfulness. In time they began to worship that power, by means of a symbolism which to us appears almost inexplicable. But relics of this curious symbolism have been found in such profusion all over the ancient world that we can entertain no doubt of the very wide extent and influence of phallic systems. Without entering into further particulars, let us note now that phallism was an attribute worship; that is to say, deity was wor- shiped by phallists through what they regarded as the chief of the divine potencies. I have suggested above that polytheistic theog- onies very likely grew out of the personification of the forces of nature. It is at least possible, however, that, in the minds of many worshipers, particularly the more enlightened, Jupiter, Astarte,</page><page sequence="13">ANCIENT TYPES OF RELIGION 585 Thor, Osiris, Dionysus, were personifications, not of natural forces, but of attributes of the true God - dimly apprehended. Initiates of the Mysteries (to be discussed later) were probably taught some sort of monotheistic doctrine, and many crumbs must have fallen from their laden table. The Hebrews had many different names for Jehovah, each referring to some attribute. For example, Elohim signifies the aggregate of the mighty forces in nature. Adonai is rendered "Lord" in our Bible. The name IHVH, a summary of all the divine powers, was held to be sacred and unpronounceable. In our version of it, Jehovah, the vowels are borrowed from Adonai, and its correct pronunciation will, in all probability, never be as- certained. Another striking example of attribute names of deity will be cited in connection with the next point. The Bible presents many instances of emphasis on attributes. This, like the occurrence of bits of anthropomorphism, is un- doubtedly due to the efforts of the Biblical writers to bring In- finity down to the reach of finite minds. All through the book there are pictures of Deity which mortals can see and com- prehend: "The Lord is my shepherd," "The shadow of a great rock in a weary land," "I am the vine, ye are the branches," "Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him." To me the Mysteries are far and away the most interesting form of ancient religious observance. Our information about them is scanty, for the vows of secrecy were well kept. But it is fairly certain, as suggested above, that in some of them the doctrine of a great, supreme Being, above all gods, was inculcated by means of symbols and allegories and dramas, and that in all of them a life beyond the grave was promised to the initiates. Immortality was presented pictorially, as a rule through the yearly death and resurrection of nature or the daily setting and rising of the sun. The Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis appears here and there, as well as progressive reincarnation; but, upon the whole, the teachings of the Mysteries, so far as they can be ascertained today, both concerning the nature of God and the eternal life of the soul, were impressive and beautiful.</page><page sequence="14">586 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL We know more about the Mysteries of Eleusis than we do of any other similar initiation, but there was hardly a civilized na- tion of antiquity which did not have its secret rites. For instance, in Persia we find the Mysteries of Mithra - embellished with the wisdom of Zoroaster; in Gaul, the Druids, as Caesar tells us, computed the size of the universe and taught their neophytes that the soul did not perish, but passed from one body into an- other; in Egypt, Osiris and Isis furnished the dramatic material for the instruction of seekers after truth. We note also, at various points in the ancient world, Mysteries of Adonis, of Dionysus, of the Cabiri, of Attis and Cybele, Orphic Mysteries, and others less important. In concluding this section, I may say that it is my firm belief that the influence of these sacred dramas upon the life and thought of their time has been vastly underestimated by stu- dents of the history of religion. Finally, Trinitarianism. The doctrine of the Trinity, or of a trinity, is to be found in practically every religious system, ancient and modern. Among the Druids, the trinity was composed of Hesuls, Belenus, and Tharamis; the Hindus worshiped their great god (whose true name, like that of the God of the Hebrews, could not lawfully be pronounced) under the three attribute names of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva; the trinity of the Ethiopians con- sisted of Neph-Amon (the creator), Phtha (matter), Neith (thought). Upon the southern spur of the Capitoline Hill, in ancient Rome, there stood the great Capitolium, a triple temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva. Innumerable other instances might be cited. The essential feature in trinitarianism is mediation. The learned Hebrew teachers, who, during the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries, evolved and developed that curious and fas- cinating theosophy known as the Kabbalah, insisted that the Great Unknowable One, being himself Infinity, could not stoop to the creation of the finite; and so he sent out from the infinite light in which he dwelt and which he was, a series of emanations (Sephiroth), which performed the actual work of making matter and the world, led and inspired by "the creative energy pro-</page><page sequence="15">ANCIENT TYPES OF RELIGION 587 ceeding from the Father"- a designation the rabbis applied to the letter Yod, the first letter of the Great Name, IHVH. The Gnostics, whom St. Paul combats so vigorously in the Epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians, held views regarding intermediary potencies quite like those of the Kabbalists. Be- tween God and his creation there intervened Thrones, Angelic Lords, Celestial Powers, Rulers, Elemental Spirits, and the Demiurge (the actual creator). Incidentally, the Hebrew word, Elohim, referred to above, has a very similar connotation. This impressive array of potencies the Gnostics called t6 o.-ilQWta. St. Paul's reply was: "For in him [Christ] dwelleth all the fulness [To' a in lata] of the Godhead bodily." In the Greek and Roman popular religions, although there was no such definite conception of a trinity as is found in most other ancient systems, there was a mediator. The Greeks called him Hermes, the Romans, Mercurius; and he was equipped with winged sandals, that he might the more easily fly to and fro be- tween heaven and earth. In Egypt, Horus (etymologically, pos- sibly the same name as Hermes) performed a similar function. The doctrine of the Trinity held by modern Christians is, in its essentials, entirely different from all other trinitarian conceptions. Four concluding remarks, by way of summary, and without discussion. First: Sages in all periods of history have presented deity in symbols, allegories, and pictures, that the finite might be enabled to apprehend a bit more clearly the infinite. And the conception of deity, arrived at independently by these earnest seekers after divine light was in all important respects the same. Second: There have always been, and are now, religious be- liefs held by the wise and enlightened which differ widely from those of the unthinking masses. Third: Divine revelation has ever been, is now, and will ever be, progressive, and adapted to the individual capacity to receive. Fourth: In these days of religious bigotry and intolerance, there is, I think, a genuine obligation resting upon you and me to be patient, open-minded, and charitable; and to remember that wisdom was not born with us and will very likely be here when we have passed on.</page></plain_text>
