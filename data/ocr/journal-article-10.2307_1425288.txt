<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Gift of the Open Hand: Le Corbusier Reading Georges Bataille's La Part Maudite NADIR LAHIJI, Georgia Institute of Technology Georges Bataille (1897-1962) was a contemporary of Le Corbusier (1887- 1965) and one of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century. He gave Le Corbusier a copy of his most celebrated book, La Part Maudite (The accursed share) and inscribed it with a warm dedication. At the time he re- ceived this gift, Le Corbusier was about to embark on the planning of Chandigarh in India. On his way to India, Le Corbusier read the book; he read it autobiographically, the same way he had read his copy of Homer's The Iliad and Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra. Le Corbusier's reading of La Part Maudite is a significant event in his late intellectual life. This essay reflects on the nature of Le Corbusier's reading. It traces the cir- cumstances of the friendship between these two very different thinkers and speculates on the origin of their affinities and the confluence of the ideas that brought them together. I argue that the notions of the gift and potlatch in La Part Maudite, coming to Bataille from Marcel Mauss, are at the origin of the idea of the Open Hand in India. SOMETIME BETWEEN 1949 AND 1953, GEORGES BATAILLE GAVE LE Corbusier a copy of his most celebrated book, La Part Maudite, essai d'economie general, la consumation (The Accursed Share).' The title page bears this inscription in Bataille's hand: "'a Monsieur Le Corbusier, en timoignage d'admiration et de sympathie." ("To Mr. Le Corbusier, a token of my admiration and sympathy.")2 On the last page of this copy, Le Corbusier wrote "19 Nov. 1953," which indi- cates the date he finished reading the book. Le Corbusier marked the text, underlined passages, and wrote commentaries on its two flyleaves. In spring 1988, the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris exhibited Le Corbusier's copy of La Part Maudite for the first time. To my knowledge, Le Corbusier never read Marcel Mauss' monu- mental work, The Gift,3 but here is a gift he received from Georges Bataille, who at the instigation of Alfred Metraux became acquainted with the theory of potlatch outlined by Mauss in Essai sur le don, forme archaique de l'dchange, which Mauss published in 1925.4 Bataille's argument in La Part Maudite owes a debt to Mauss's work. Le Corbusier was fascinated by the chapter "Le don de rivalite (le "potlatch ")" (The gift of rivalry: "Potlatch") in La Part Maudite, where Bataille discussed the idea of the gift. In his overview of Bataille's text, written on the flyleaf, Le Corbusier made these re- marks about the section "Theorie du potlatch'. l'acquisition du 'rang"' (Theory of "potlatch": The acquisition of rank), with refer- ence to page 92 of his copy of La Part Maudite: Les 5 volumes [des] oeuvres complktes [de] Corbu offrent, proposent et imposent par adhesion enthousiaste les iddes [de] Corbu. D'un c6td Corbu est assume par les salauds, de l'autre il est roi. La pratique disint&amp;ress'e de la peinture est un inlassable sacrifice, un don du temps, de patience, d'amour, sans aucune contrepartie d'argent (sauf les modernes marchands). C'est semer a tout vent pour inconnus. Un jour avant ou apres la mort, on nous dira merci. C'est trop tard pour tant de traverses v&amp;cues. Mais qu'importe; ce qui importe est la clef du bonheur.5 [Brackets indicate addi- tions to the handwritten text for clarity.-Ed.] Phillip Duboy cites this passage in his article for Le Corbusier, Une Encylopedie. Duboy writes that Le Corbusier penned this commen- tary on a flight to the new capital of Punjab, Chandigarh.6 He sug- gests that "this brief reflection" by Le Corbusier is the source for the Open Hand at Chandigarh. Duboy suggests that these remarks sig- nify the definition of Le Corbusier as a modern hero, the true sub- ject of modernity that owes its definition to Walter Benjamin. On the basis of Le Corbusier's reading of Bataille, Duboy suggests that one might be tempted to define the modern heroes with what Jacques Lacan would characterize as "qu 'illustrent des exploits dirisoires dans une situation d'dgarement" ("which illustrates the laughable achievements in a state of bewilderment").7 Whatever definition of the modern hero we might employ, we would do well to remember what Walter Benjamin, in his monumental Passagen- werk, wrote about the essence of modernity: "To embrace Breton and Le Corbusier-that would be to draw the spirit of contempo- ( ..... ??:.,. , , .. , .

Yet, why should Bataille, in an act of verbal potlatch and expenditure of words, give a gift "d'admiration et de sympathie" to Le Corbusier? To which Le Corbusier does Bataille issue this gift: the architect, the painter, the planner, the fellow trav- eler, or the political comrade? I shall come back to this later in this essay. Let me state here that an unbridgeable abyss would seem to separate Le Corbusier and Georges Bataille; they are two different thinkers. Yet I suggest that we should take "Bataille with Le Corbusier" as twentieth-century contemporaries, in the sense that Jacques Lacan takes "Kant with Sade."10 Bataille reserved enough admiration for Le Corbusier to give him a copy of his La Part Maudite as a gift. Le Corbusier was the first architect to read Georges Bataille's most important work. In fact, Le Corbusier was one of the very few intellectuals who read Bataille's La Part Maudite in its first printing, which sold only fifty copies and did not find a wider audience at the time of its publication." In this re- spect, one might admit Le Corbusier into the circle of Bataille's asso- ciates: Michel Leiris, Andre Masson, Antoine Artaud, Maurice Blanchot, and Jacques Lacan, to name only a few. One can speculate that in his reading of Bataille's La Part Maudite, Le Corbusier found a confirmation of his reading of Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra some fifty years earlier: He perceived himself in strife as a tragic hero, whose life was spent as a sacrificial "gift" to humanity. If compared with his reading of Nietzsche, Le Corbusier's reading of Bataille when he was in his early sixties may seem to be an incidental event in his later life and works; perhaps one can call this reading posthumous. However, following Duboy, I want to argue that the sources behind the idea of the Open Hand might be found in Le Corbusier's reading of Bataille. Moreover, a reading of Bataille's idea of depense ("expenditure") might shed further light on our interpre- tation of Le Corbusier's later work. I suggest that La Part Maudite strongly influenced Le Corbusier's Plan of Chandigarh. Particularly, I argue that besides the Nietzschean connection in the main ouverte, which has aptly been brought up by Manfredo Tafuri, one should think of the Open Hand in the light of Bataille's notion of sacrifice.12 Le Corbusier's reading of Georges Bataille's work was an "autobio- graphical" one, not unlike his reading of a new translation of Homer's The Iliad some years later, which he attempted to illustrate.13 I How did Bataille know Le Corbusier? Where did his "sympathy and admiration" for Le Corbusier lie? Why did Le Corbusier take an interest in ideas exercised by Bataille in La Part Maudite? Until more archival documents surface, any definitive answer to these questions must be postponed. Nevertheless, we can speculate on a convergence of ideas that brought these two thinkers together in the complex years of the thirties in France.'4 Part of the answer must be sought in the similarities between Le Corbusier's and Bataille's poli- tics during the thirties.'5 One could presume that Bataille came to know Le Corbusier through the magazine L'Esprit Nouveau, and later through the journal Minotaure, which was founded in 1933 by Georges Bataille and Andre Masson, dissident surrealists who gath- ered together other artists who became disillusioned with Andre Breton. Le Corbusier contributed the article "Louis Soutter, L'inconnue de la soixantaine" to Minotaure 9 in 1936. Bataille's inscription in Le Corbusier's copy of La Part Maudite bears no date, so it is difficult to determine exactly when Bataille gave his book to Le Corbusier, but we can speculate with some certainty that Le Corbusier dealt with the book around and during the time that he began to get involved in the Chandigarh project in India. Albert Mayer and Matthew Nowicki had already established a master plan and sketches of the Capitol area of Chandigarh around 1950. In late 1950, Le Corbusier took over the job after the sudden death of Nowicki while flying over Egypt. Le Corbusier flew to India in February 1951.16 According to Duboy, Le Corbusier wrote his overview of Bataille's work on this flight. In the thirties, Le Corbusier was preoccupied with the idea of planisme, which explains his interest in the section "The Marshall Plan" in the last part of La Part Maudite.17As Allan Stoekl informs us, Bataille's planiste tendency come to the surface after the war in La Part Maudite.'8 At the beginning of the fifties, Le Corbusier re- alized in the Chandigarh plan the ideas of planning that he had put forward in the thirties, but clearly the conception of planning in Chandigarh is radically different from that of planning in the thir- ties. To demonstrate this, we might turn to two chapters in the first volume of La Part Maudite. "The Gift of Rivalry: 'Potlatch"' and "The Marshall Plan." Le Corbusier paid special attention to these chapters, heavily marking paragraphs and making commentaries.19 Bataille's thoughts on potlatch and the Marshall Plan enabled Le Corbusier to see his role in the Chandigarh plan. The nature of this plan was different from that of Ville Radieuse in its fundamental philosophi- cal premises and in its architectural concept. Le Corbusier's read- 51 Lahiji</page><page sequence="3">ing of the idea of potlatch in La Part Maudite reinforced his philo- sophical conviction about his gigantic, humanistic mission in the Chandigarh project: a plan for the newly born nation of India in need of its own singular transition to a modern state.20 Let us not forget that Le Corbusier conceived of the plan for Chandigarh in the aftermath of his frustrated attempts at urban planning for the major cities in the West, which forever remained unrealized. In the thirties, Le Corbusier was intensely, aggressively, and internationally involved in putting forward his urbanistic ideas. In the center of all of these projects was a fundamental ideology of central economic planning with authoritarian political control. In addition to his ongoing design and projects, his major activities during this period included publishing Pricision sur un Atatprdsent de l'architecture et de l'urbanisme in 1930; launching a number of studies of town planning for cities, including Algiers (Plan Obus, A, B, C, D, E), Paris, Barcelona, and Stockholm; proposing the Ville Radieuse in 1933; becoming an active member of the Interna- tional Congress of Modern Architecture (CIAM); paying his last visit to the Soviet Union in 1930; publishing his Quand les cathddrales dtaient blanches in 1937; and organizing his exhibitions in the United States and Europe.2' The term planisme, or "technocratism," refers to the main line of debate in France during the thirties. The figures debating this notion contributed to the review Plans, a short-lived journal founded by Philip Lamour in 1931 to which two contemporaries of Bataille, Robert Aron and Arnold Dandieu, contributed. They were connected to the Ordre Nouveau, and their political positions had much in common with what Bataille expounded in his brilliant and influential 1933 essay, "The Notion of Expenditure."22 Bataille wrote this essay for the journal La Critique Sociale at the age of thirty-five. He was fifty-two when he published La Part Maudite, which he described in the preface as the fruit of eighteen years of work. Both texts proceed from his discovery of Marcel Mauss' The Gift around the end of the twenties.23 Le Corbusier was on the editorial board of Plans in 1931 and 1932. He regularly participated and actively contributed to this journal.24 He wrote and published eighteen articles on urbanism between January 1931 and July 1932, many of which he later col- lected and reprinted in section 4 of La Ville Radieuse.25 The ideas expounded by Arnaud Dandieu, the leader of Ordre Nouveau and a librarian, like Bataille at the Biblioteque National in Paris, influ- enced Bataille.26 Dandieu published La Rdvolution Nicessaire in col- laboration with Robert Aron in late 1933, the same year that Bataille published "The Psychological Structure of Fascism" in La Critique Sociale. Dandieu was also a contributor to Bataille's review Documents.27 During 1933, Bataille had episodic relations with Ordre Nouveau. He anonymously collaborated with Dandieu and Aron on the chapter "Echanges et Credits" of their Revolution Nicessaire.28 The thirties in France were times of complex political movements and debates on syndicalism, communism, American- ism, and fascism. The Ordre Nouveau movement, headed by Dandieu, joined with the participants of Plans in fall 1931 to estab- lish a "genuine European federation." It is possible that through this collaboration, Le Corbusier and Dandieu came to know of each other's ideas; and that through Dandieu and Plans, Bataille could have come to know Le Corbusier. In any case, we can conclude that Bataille's admiration for Le Corbusier in 1949 is rooted in this pe- riod, when Le Corbusier's ideas on urbanism and planning might have found a sympathetic ear in Bataille. Bataille's planisme later bears similarities to Le Corbusier's. This helps explain why Le Corbusier took a special interest in La Part Maudite's last chapter on the Marshall Plan. The argument advanced by Bataille and the question he confronted were of the same nature as the ones that Dandieu and Aron dealt with between 1931 and 1933.29 In La Part Maudite, Bataille attempts to subvert the existing political economy, which was grounded in rationality and utility, and replace it with a "general economy.'"30 In this general economy, unproductive expenditure-sacrifice, luxury, war, games, monu- ments-determines social life. As one commentator notes, this no- tion of general economy "is not the store and the workshop, the bank and the factory, which hold the key from which the principles of the economy can be deduced. In the blood that spurts from the open chest of victims sacrificed to the sun in an Aztec ritual, in the sumptuous and ruinous feasts offered to the courtiers of Versailles by the monarch of divine right, in all these mad dissipations is found a secret that our restricted economics has covered up and caused to be forgotten."" In the thesis of the general economy, so- cial wealth is not a utilitarian vision, the parsimonious viewpoint of an ascetic bourgeoisie, which spends only when it expects return. Rather, society itself is formed in "the mode of expenditure of the excess, the consumption of the superfluous, this accursed share ... The dominant prosaic vision may be only a recently formed preju- dice contemporaneous with the reign of the bourgeoisie, ushered in by the Reformation, and unable to account for the real and ineluc- table movement of wealth in a society, a movement that sovereignty engages human beings: their relationship to the sacred through re- ligion, mysticism, art, eroticism.'"32 Some of the themes in La Part Maudite had already been anticipated in "The Notion of Expendi- ture": "Human activity is not entirely reducible to processes of pro- duction and conservation, and consumption must be divided into September 1996 JAE 50/1 52</page><page sequence="4">3.

The first part, Bataille writes, is represented by the minimum productive activity necessary for the conservation of life in a given society; the second part is represented by "so-called unproductive expenditure: luxury, mourning, war, cults, the con- struction of sumptuary monuments, games, spectacles, arts, per- verse sexual activity (i.e., deflected from genital finality)-all these represent activities which, at least in primitive circumstances, have no end beyond themselves.""33 In part 2 of La Part Maudite, in the chapter "Sacrifice or Consumption," Le Corbusier marked and underlined the following passage: Cette consumation inutile est ce qui m'agree, aussit6t levd le souci du lendemain. Et si je consume ainsi sans mesure, je revele a mes semblable ce que je suis intimement: la consumation est la voie par oi communiquent des etres s~'pares. Tout transparait, tout est ouvert et tout est infini, entre ceux qui consument intensement. Mais rien ne compte des lors, la violence se libere et elle se dichaine sans limites, dans la mesure oih la chaleur s'accroit.34 In the left margin of this passage, Le Corbusier wrote the word fusion, which I take to be a reference to the section "Fusion" in "The Poem of the Right Angle." In "The Marshall Plan," Bataille returns to an affirmation of certain planisme that during the thir- ties had certain associations with forms of authoritarianism, protofascism, and Marxism.35 Planisme was the very essence of a centrally organized society with a political leader. During the Aciphale period in the thirties, Bataille was critical of planisme. As Stoekl observes, Aciphale, a 1936 drawing by Andre Masson, "is a figure that bears death, but at the same time 'he' is a perfectly co- herent and traditional 'sacred figure' around which a society, albeit one of conspirators, can be established. ... While the head is clearly missing, the stars (nipples), bowels and death's head (genital) only go to create another face, another 'figure humaine.' Further, the death's head itself has a miniature face. ... The 'acephale,' in other words, has lost a head, a principle of organization and order, only to mutate and develop another, more hypnotic, doubled and dou- bling (replicating) face."36 In Le Corbusier's idea of Ville Radieuse, there was no "acephalic head" as (dis)organizing principle, but rather it was the very "head" at the top of a hierarchy that was the organizing principle. This plan was compatible with Dandieu and Aron's authoritarianism and the imperative of a center. In the chapter "Soviet Industrialization," in La Part Maudite, Bataille wrote, "Rien n'est ferme . qui reconnait simplement les conditions matirielles de la pensee. Et c'est de toutes parts et de toutes fagons que le monde invite l'homme a le changer. Sans doute l'homme de ce cbte-ci n'est pas necessairment appelk a suivre les voies imperieuses de I'URSS. Dans la plus grande mesure il se con- sume aujourd'hui dans la stdrilit" d'un anticommunisme effray6. Mais s'il a ses problkmes propres . resoudre, il a mieux " faire qu'I maudire aveuglkment, qu'. crier une detresse que commandent ses contradictions multiplides. Qu'il s'efforce de comprende ou mieux qu'il admire la cruelle energie de ceux qui d6foncerent le sol russe, il sera plus proche des taches qui l'attendent. Car c'est de toutes parts et de toutesfafons qu 'un monde en mouvement veut htre changd.'"37 Le Corbusier circled this paragraph and wrote below it, "Depuis 35 anneesjefais des Plans ... car c'est la pricisiment, mon r6le et mon devoir"("For 35 years I have designed ... because this is precisely my role and my duty"). Later, I will come back to the significance of this remark. Bataille begins "The Marshall Plan" by saying, "Outside of the Soviet world, there is nothing that has the value of an ascendant movement, nothing advances with any vigor. There persists a pow- erless dissonance of moans, of things already heard, of bold testi- mony to resolute incomprehension. This disorder is more favorable no doubt to the birth of an authentic self-conciousness than is its op- posite, and one might even say that without this powerlessness-and without the tension that is maintained by communism's aggressive- ness-consciousness would not be free, would not be alert."38 (This passage was also underlined by Le Corbusier.) The Marshall Plan responded to the threat of Soviet hegemony in an impoverished Eu- rope. It was a plan by which the United States could peacefully en- ter into competition with the Soviets. After all, "a plan must be 53 Lahiji</page><page sequence="5">evolved through which a military confrontation is avoided."39 The Marshall Plan, according to Bataille, "is the solution to the problem. It is the only way to transfer to Europe the products without which the world's fever would rise."40 (This passage was also underlined by Le Corbusier.) The Marshall Plan was different from the planisme of Dandieu and Aron and from the Ville Radieuse. The end of this plan is a potlatch, a "spending without return" already put forward by Bataille in "The Notion of Expenditure." As opposed to socialist state planning, controlled by an authoritarian "head," the Marshall Plan was "headless" planning. Truman, after Roosevelt, was the "acephalic head." Stoekl points out that this is "'planning without a head' in another sense as well: the 'end' of planning is planlessness. ... Just as the most elaborately conceived planning is inseparable from potlatch, so too the most integrated, nonindividuated con- sciousness (the consciousness that arises at the end of history, through an impossible 'awareness' of the [non] 'objective' of the Marshall Plan) is indissociable from the nothingness it 'knows.' At this point one can see how Bataille's economic project folds back into the secular mystical experience of the Somme atheologique.'"4' Le Corbusier's careful reading of this chapter in marking ev- ery page clearly indicates his affirmation of Bataille's thesis, but it is more than an affirmation. I would argue that Le Corbusier found his "headless" Truman in the "acephalic head" of Nehru. At Chandigarh, Le Corbusier transcends the planisme of the thirties and the authoritarianism of Ville Radieuse. The Chandigarh plan is clearly a plan without a head and free of a hierarchical dis- tribution. It is a potlatch of an "excessive" expenditure of space; its structure is a disarticulated and disjunctive (de)composition. In this plan, Le Corbusier frees himself from the anthropomorphic body of Ville Radieuse and authoritarian control and achieves a body (dis)organization akin to Andre Masson's Acephale. In regarding the Chandigarh plan, it would be instructive to read Bataille's article "Architecture," published in Documents in 1929. This was the first article that Bataille published in Documents' dictionary, which was devoted to architecture. The first paragraph states: Architecture is the expression of the true nature of societies, as physiognomy is the expression of the nature of individu- als. However, this comparison is applicable, above all, to the physiognomy of officials (prelates, magistrates, admirals). In fact, only society's ideal nature-that of authoritative com- mand and prohibition-expresses itself in actual architectural constructions. Thus the great monuments rise up like dams, opposing a logic of majesty and authority to all unquiet ele- ments; it is in the form of cathedrals and palaces that church and state speak to and impose silence upon the crowds. In- deed, monuments obviously inspire good social behavior and often even genuine fear. The fall of the Bastille is symbolic of this state of things. This mass movement is difficult to explain otherwise than by popular hostility towards monuments which are their veritable masters.42 According to Bataille, architecture starts as the soul of the so- ciety, a neutral image that later will intervene in the very social or- der that it symbolizes. In this reversal, to follow Hollier's comments, the relationship between architecture and the society that it expresses is analogically similar to the relationship between Inca civilization and its imperialistic system of state control, also the pre-Colombian Mexicans, or Aztecs, and their sacrifices atop pyra- mids, which Bataille discussed in "Sacrifices and Wars of the Az- tecs,4" in La Part Maudite. Bataille wrote that all important undertakings of the Aztecs were useless: "Their science of architec- ture enabled them to construct pyramids on top of which they im- molated human beings.""44 He continues, "The priests killed their victims on top of the pyramids. They would stretch them over a stone altar and strike them in the chest with an obsidian knife. They would tear out the still-beating heart and raise it thus to the sun. Most of the victims were prisoners of war, which justified the idea of wars as necessary to the life of the sun: Wars meant consumption, not conquest, and the Mexicans thought that if they ceased the sun would cease to give life.""' Le Corbusier's Chandigarh plan projects an image of expen- diture and distribution of wealth and space for a new India by pre- cisely suspending and disrupting the physiognomy of a hierarchical body, which is based not on consumption, but rather on utility and production, such as Le Corbusier symbolized in Ville Radieuse. The expenditure of space in Chandigarh knows no boundry; it is a sacri- ficial giving of space, returning to the sun its gift of accursed energy. Manfredo Tafuri, the only historian who has drawn on Bataille's writing to interpret Le Corbusier's late work, aptly cap- tured the spirit of the Chandigarh plan. He wrote, "Nothing in fact joins together the gigantic volume of the Secretariat, the Parliament, and the High Court of Justice: nothing-neither roads, perspectival allusions, nor formal triangulations-helps the eye to situate itself with respect to these three 'characters,' which weave among them- selves a discussion from which the human ear is able to gather only weak and distorted echoes. Indeed, the modeling of the terrain, the dislocation of level, the mirrors of water, especially the Pool of Re- flection, are all there to accentuate discontinuities and ruptures."46 Tafuri also points out, "Interruptions, slippings, and distortions September 1996 JAE 50/1 54</page><page sequence="6">indeed pervade the language of the later Le Corbusier: at Chandigarh they are essential to the dramatization of the forms. The three great 'desiring objects' seek to shatter their own solitude: the Secretariat through its inclined ramp and the broken meshes of its facade gradations; the Parliament through the distortion of the geometric solids that dominate it like hermetic totems; the high Court of Justice through the bending of the brise-soleil and the gi- ant entrance stairway. But the interchange takes place only at a dis- tance: tension informs this dialogue among symbols that have lost the codes that once gave them the value of names.""47 The economy of this plan is analogous to the "solar economy" in squandering its energy for total dipense. In this plan, the culture of Schure's "great initiates" comes to meet the secular mysticism of Bataille's Somme athdologique. This vision of potlatch culminates in the main ouverte. This will lead us to the significance of the idea of the gift. With the idea of the gift let us return to the notion of an "autobiographical reading" of Bataille's book by Le Corbusier that I suggested at the beginning of this essay. II In La Part Maudite, Bataille discussed the idea of the gift in a chap- ter titled "The Gift of Rivalry: 'Potlatch."' Le Corbusier made some commentaries and remarks on this chapter. I mentioned earlier Le Corbusier's overview of Bataille's text written on the flyleaf, to which I want to return here. Le Corbusier wrote, "La pratique disintiressde de la peinture est un inlassable sacrifice, un don du temps de patience, d'amour, sans aucune contrepartie d'argent." ("The un- selfish practice of painting is an unflagging sacrifice, a gift of time, patience, and love, expecting no material reward.") In this remark, Le Corbusier draws a parallel between Bataille's notion of dipense and the identity of his own work. Through Bataille's writing, he sees the truth in his paintings as a token of the sacrifice of himself. He appropriates Bataille's argument as his own and sees himself in its mirror. When Le Corbusier writes "a gift of time and patience . .. with no material reward," "time" and "patience" equal the "gift" itself. Before I reflect further, let us see how the idea of the gift en- tered Bataille's thinking. In "The Notion of Expenditure," Bataille quoted Marcel Mauss: "The ideal would be to give a potlatch and not have it returned."48 His reading of Mauss' The Gift enabled Bataille to formulate his notion of the general economy, as he ad- mits in The Accursed Share. In The Gift, Mauss wrote, "If one gives things and returns them, it is because one is giving and returning respect'-we still say 'courtesies.' Yet, it is also by giving that one is giving oneself and if one gives oneself it is because one 'owes' one- self-one's person and one's goods-to others.""9 This remark would have appealed to Le Corbusier had he read it. Mauss explored the institution of potlatch in the Pacific Northwest in his elaboration of the theory of gift in archaic societ- ies. He wrote, "The obligation to give is the essence ofthe potlatch."50 The word potlatch comes from Nootka Indian potatsh or patlatsh as a noun and a verb meaning "gift" and "giving." Among some North American Indians of the Pacific Coast, the word means "a gift, a present" and "a tribal feast at which presents are given and received, given by an aspirant to chiefship." It also means "an extravagant giving away or throwing away of possessions to enhance one's pres- tige or establish one's position."51 We have to go to Mauss for the sociological and ethnographical signification of the idea ofpotlatch. In the introduction to The Gift, he writes: Within these two tribes of the American Northwest and throughout this region there appears what is certainly a type of these "total services," rare but highly developed. We pro- pose to call this form the "potlatch," as moreover, do Ameri- can authors using the Chinook term, which become part of the everyday language of Whites and Indians from Vancouver to Alaska. The word potlatch essentially means "to feed," to "consume." ... Yet what is noteworthy about these tribes is the principle of rivalry and hostility that prevails in all these practices. They go as far as to fight and kill chiefs and nobles. Moreover, they even go as far as the purely sumptuary de- struction of wealth that has been accumulated in order to outdo the rival chief as well as his associates (normally a grandfather, father-in-law, or son-in-law). There is total ser- vice in the sense that it is indeed the whole clan that contracts on behalf of all, for all that it possesses and for all that it does, through the person of its chief. But this act of "service" on the part of the chief takes on an extremely marked agonistic char- acter. It is essentially usurious and sumptuary. It is a struggle between nobles to establish a hierarchy amongst themselves from which their clan will benefit at a later date. We propose to reserve the term potlatch for this kind of institution that, with less risk and more accuracy, but also at a greater length, we might call: total service ofan agonistic type.52 Further, Mauss gives an exact definition for potlatch: "The obligation to give is the essence of the potlatch. ""5 The etymological root for the word gift is more complex. Mauss, in a footnote, goes into the meanings of that word in detail. The word gift, he says "is 55 Lahiji</page><page sequence="7">the translation of the Latin dosis, itself a transcription of the Greek 'dose, dose of poison."'54 He goes on, "This etymology presumes that High and Low German dialectics would have preserved a learned name for a thing in common use .... One would need to explain the choice of the word gift for this translation, as well as the converse linguistic taboo that has hung over the meaning of gift for this word in certain Germanic languages. Finally, the Latin, and above all the Greek use of the word dosis, with the meaning of poi- son, proves that, with the Ancients, too, there was an association of ideas and moral rules of the kind that we are describing."" Further- more, Mauss says, "We have compared the uncertain meaning of giflwith that of the Latin word venenum. ... To this must be added the comparison . . . of venia, venenum, from vanati (Sanskrit, 'to give pleasure'), and gewinnuen, 'to win."'56 Remarkably, this de- scription of the uncertain meaning of the word gift brings it into the association with another equally ambiguous Greek word, pharmakon.57 This ambiguity in the meaning of gift is the subject of Jacques Derrida's remarkable essays in Given Time: 1. Counter- feit Money.58 In this work, Derrida has taken up the question of the economic reasoning in the idea of gift, or present, and its relation- ship to the philosophical category of time in Marcel Mauss' The Gift. In his analysis, Derrida remarks on the "madness" of the giv- ing without restitution in the face of which the economic reason- ing of the gift falters. The passage in support of Derrida's reflection on the "madness" of gift in Mauss reads as follow: No less important in the transaction of the Indians is the role played by honor. Nowhere is the individual prestige of a chief and that of his clan so closely linked to what is spent and to the meticulous repayment with interest of gifts that have been accepted, so as to transform those who have obligated you into the obligated ones. Consumption and destruction are here really without limits. In certain kinds of potlatch, one must expend all that one has, keeping nothing back. It is a competition to see who is the richest and also the most madly extravagant. Everything is based upon the principle of an- tagonism and of rivalry. The political status of individuals in the brotherhoods and clans, and ranks of all kinds are gained in a "war of property," just as they are in real war, or through chance, inheritance, alliance, and marriage. Yet everything is conceived of as if it were a "struggle of wealth." Marriages for one's children and places in the brotherhoods are only won during the potlatch where exchange and reciprocity rule. They are lost in the potlatch as they are lost in war, by gam- bling or in running and wrestling. In a certain number of cases, it is not even a question of giving and returning, but of destroying, so as not to want even to appear to desire repay- ment. Whole boxes of olachen (candlefish) oil or whale oil are burnt, as are houses and thousands of blankets. The most valuable copper objects are broken and thrown into the wa- ter, in order to crush and to "flatten" one's rival. . ... In this way one not only promotes oneself, but also one's family, up the social scale. It is therefore a system of law and economics in which considerable wealth is constantly being expended and transformed. One may, if one so desires, call these trans- fer acts by the name of exchange or even trade and sale; but such trade is noble, replete with etiquette and generosity. At least, when it is carried on in another spirit, with a view to immediate gain, it is the object of very marked scorn.59 The economic reasoning in the notion of the gift lies in its vicious circularity. Derrida writes, "For there to be a gift, there must be no reciprocity, return, exchange, countergift, or debt. If the other gives me back or owes me or has to give me back what I give him or her, there will not have been a gift, whether this restitution is im- mediate or whether it is programmed by a complex calculation of a long-term deferral or difference. "60 Further Derrida continues: If the gift is annulled in the economic odyssey of the circle as soon it appears as gift or as soon as it signifies itself as gift, there is no longer any "logic of the gift," and one may safely say that a consistent discourse on the gift becomes impossible: It misses its object and always speaks, finally, of something else. One can go so far as to say that a work as monumental as Marcel Mauss's The Gift speaks of everything but the gift: It deals with economy, exchange, contract (do ut des), it speaks of raising the stakes, sacrifice, gift and countergift- in short, everything that in the thing itself impels the gift and the annulment of the gift. All the gift supplements (potlatch, transgression and excess, surplus values, the necessity to give or give back more, returns with interest-in short, the whole sacrificial bidding war) are destined to bring about once again the circle in which they are annulled.61 Derrida then concludes, "The gift is not a gift, the gift only gives to the extent it gives time. The difference between a gift and every other operation of pure and simple exchange is that the gift gives time. There where there is gift, there is time. What it gives, the gift is time, but this gift of time is also a demand of time. The thing must not be restituted immediately and right away. There must be September 1996 JAE 50/1 56</page><page sequence="8">time, it must last, there must be waiting-without forgetting."'62 The gift of time, and the patience in or of time, is what Le Corbusier claims that he has given in his paintings. This given time is the gift, precisely because it cannot be restituted immediately, even though Le Corbusier waited for its restitution. In the section "The Theory of Potlatch," Bataille inscribes the idea of the gift in the context of general economy. "We need to give away, or lose or destroy," he says. "But the gift would be senseless (and so we would never decide to give) if it did not take on the meaning of an acquisition. Hence giving must become acquiring a power. Gift-giving has the virtue of a surpassing of the subject who gives, but in exchange for the object given, the subject appropriates the surpassing. He regards his virtue, that which he had the capac- ity for, as an asset, as a power that he now possesses."63 Le Corbusier paid special attention to the section "The Acquisition of Rank," which starts with this passage: "Doubtless potlatch is not reducible to the desire to lose, but what it brings to the giver is not the inevitable increase of return gifts; it is the rank which it confers on the one who has the last word" [Bataille's italics].64 Le Corbusier marked the words rank and inevitable in this passage and marked the rest of the section with numerous underlinings. Bataille in this section defines power as distinct from prestige and glory and says, "It must be said, further, that the identity of the power and the ability to lose is fun- damental [Le Corbusier's emphasis]."''65 Bataille continues, "As the surviving practices make clear, rank varies decisively according to an individual's capacity for giving [Le Corbusier's emphasis].'"66 Toward the end of the section, Bataille wrote, "Combat is glorious in that it is always beyond calculation at some moment. But the meaning of warfare and glory is poorly grasped if it is not related in part to the acquisition ofrank through a reckless expenditure of vital resources, ofwhichpotlach is the most legible form [Le Corbusier's emphasis]."-67 Thus, potlatch is a struggle for pure prestige, which is achieved through the generation of what Bataille calls the "propriWe'positive de perte" ("positive property of loss") through which, as Suzanne Guerlac informs us, nonutilitarian values such as honor, rank, or glory are acquired.68 In this regard, the anguish and suffering of Le Corbusier, portrayed in his self-image, lies in the fact that his act of giving has not been restituted, or so he believes. Thus, he acquires rank and pure prestige by the act of potlatch. It is in this belief that he could remark, "C'est semer "a tout vent pour inconnus. Un jour avant ou apres la mort, on nous dira merci." ("This sowing to the wind is for unknown people. One day, before or after my death, they will say thank you.") Perhaps it is in this context that one should judge all the episodes of postwar writings by Le Corbusier, in which we find statements of self-deprecation, self-portrayal as a tragic hero, which oftentimes verges on the border of the quixotic comic and risible, autobiographical identification with tragic heroes, self-delusion, and repeated references to himself as a figure unappreciated by the public, none of which have been missed by his critics. To this rep- ertoire one should add this lamenting statement: "Unjour avant ou apres la mort, on nous dira merci. " In the light of this reading, all of the elements in Le Corbusier's flyleaf commentary, cited at the beginning of this article, come together. Thus we begin to understand the meaning and char- acter of his autobiographical reading. Le Corbusier saw in his own humanity, art, and mission nothing short of self-sacrifice-that is, he saw his life as potlatch and as a gift to humanity with no return what- soever. When Le Corbusier later reflected on Homer's The Iliad through his twenty-four drawings, in precisely the same fashion he identified himself with the heroes Hector and Paris, combative fig- ures who suffered the violence of life in the face of its abject injus- tice. He saw in them his own image. However, this is not yet sufficient to advance the claim that Le Corbusier's ultimate self-sac- rifice culminated in his idea of la main ouverte, or "Open Hand." III Bataille's "Rotten Sun," published in Documents 3 in 1933, was part of an "Hommage 'i Picasso." In the same year in Documents 8, he published "Sacrificial Mutilation and the Severed Ear of Vincent van Gogh."69 He devoted another short essay to van Gogh in 1937 called "van Gogh as Prometheus."70 In 1931, he wrote "The Solar Anus." In 1928, he wrote his famous The Story ofthe Eye, which he published under the pseudonym Lord Auch; "The Pineal Eye," posthumously published, was probably written in 1928 or 1931. The common theme of these writings is Bataille's conception of the sun, which he later discussed in La Part Maudite in relation to Az- tec sacrifices: "The sun himself was in their eyes the expression of sacrifice."71 For Bataille, "the truth of the sun," Nick Land tells us, lies "at the peak of its prodigal glory, . . . the necessity of useless waste, where the celestial and the base conspire in the eclipse of rational moderation.'"72 Land comments on Bataille's "blind sun or blind- ing sun, it matters little," by saying that "an Icarian collapse into the sun ... consummates apprehension only by translating it into the register of the intolerable. In the copulation with the sun-which is no more a gratification than a representation-subject and object fuse at the level of their profound consistency, exhibiting in blind- ness that they were never what they were."73 57 Lahiji</page><page sequence="9">In the essay "Rotten Sun," Bataille wrote, "One might add that the sun has also been mythologically expressed by a man slash- ing his own throat, as well as by an anthropomorphic being deprived of a head.... The myth of Icarus is particularly expressive from this point of view: it clearly splits the sun in two-the one that was shin- ing at the moment ofIcarus's elevation, and the one that melted the wax, causing failure and a screaming fall when Icarus got too close.""4 Picasso, for Bataille, was that contemporary artist who, through de- composition of forms in his painting, achieved the rupture in blind- ing brilliance that was associated with two conceptions of the sun. In the essay on the self-mutilation of van Gogh, Bataille brings the idea of sacrifice to an analysis of self-mutilation. As we have already ob- served, belonging to the notion of sacrifice in Bataille's work is the word depense. ("expenditure"). "This word operates in a network of thought that he describes as general or solar economy: the econom- ics of excess," Nick Land says."5 This is based on Bataille: "The ra- diation of the sun is distinguished by its unilateral character: it loses itselfwithout reckoning, without counterpart. Solar economy is founded upon this principle."76 The sun squanders itself on us without a return because "we are ultimately nothing but the effect of the sun." In "The Notion of Expenditure," Bataille took up the notion of sacri- fice. In the section entitled "The Principle of Loss," he wrote, "From the point of view of expenditure, artistic productions must be divided into two main categories, the first constituted by architectural con- struction, music, and dance. This category is comprised of real ex- penditures. Nevertheless, sculpture and painting, not to mention the use of sites for ceremonies and spectacles, introduces even into archi- tecture the principle of the second category, that of symbolic expen- diture. For their part, music and dance can easily be charged with external signification . . . the term poetry, applied to the least de- graded and least intellectualized forms of expression of a state of loss, can be considered synonymous with expenditure; it in fact signifies, in the most precise way, creation by means of loss. Its meaning is therefore close to that of sacrifice."'7 Returning to the theme of sacrifice in the essay on van Gogh, Bataille reminds the reader of Areteus, who wrote of sick people in ancient times who tore off their own limbs to pay homage to gods who demanded such a sacrifice. He goes on to say, "There is, in fact, no reason to separate van Gogh's ear or Gaston F.'s finger from Prometheus's famous liver . .. then the tearing out of the liver pre- sents a theme in conformity with the various legends of the 'sacri- fice of the god' ... the eagle-god who is confused with the sun by the ancients, the eagle who alone among all beings can contemplate while staring at 'the sun in all its glory,' the Icarian being who goes to seek the fire of the heaven is, however, nothing other than automutilator, a Vincent van Gogh, a Gaston F.""78 For Bataille, automutilation is the elementary fact of the "alteration" of the per- son. As Rosalind Krauss reminds us, the sun god in the "Rotten Sun" and the Van Gogh essays embodies waste and destruction; Bataille invented terms like informe, ac~phale, basses, automutilation, and blindness to shake the certainty of paradigms and release the effect of the things unassimilable by us.79 In "van Gogh as Prometheus," Bataille wrote, "For it was no mere bloody ear that van Gogh detached from his own head bearing it off to that 'House' (the troubling, crude, and childish image of the world we represent to others). Van Gogh, who decided by 1882 that it was better to be Prometheus than Jupiter, tore from within himself rather than an ear, nothing less than a SUN." Bataille continues, "Vincent van Gogh belongs not to art history, but to the bloody myth of our ex- istence as humans. He is of that rare company who, in a word spell- bound by stability, by sleep, suddenly reached the terrible 'boiling point' without which all that claims to endure becomes insipid, in- tolerable, declines. For this 'boiling point' has meaning not only for him who attains it, but for all, even though all may notyet perceive that which binds man's savage destiny to radiance, to explosion, to flame, and only thereby to power."80 Eric Michaud comments on this passage, "Bataille grasped the painter's double bond-or per- haps we should say double bind-to radiance and withering, but perhaps he absorbed it too quickly in the sacrificial figure of Prometheus."81 It is not possible to determine whether Le Corbusier was fa- miliar with the essays Bataille wrote during the thirties, but judg- ing from his underlining of the chapter "Sacrifice and Wars of the Aztec" in La Part Maudite, particularly the section "Sacrifice or Consumption," it is certain that Le Corbusier understood the ele- ments of Bataille's argument on sacrifice. My concern here is the relevance of this understanding for the interpretation of the Open Hand, especially in the light of what Bataille said about sacrifice and its relationship to the work of art. Through the literature on the Open Hand, we are already familiar with the Ruskinian image dis- cussed by Mary Patricia May Sekler, no less the politics of the Open Hand that Stanislaus von Moos takes up. However, we should single out in the complex history of this image the powerful inter- pretation of the Open Hand in relation to Heideggerian thinking on technology by Manfredo Tafuri.82 To this we might append a reading of this image in relation to the notion of sacrifice. In some respects, Le Corbusier's commentary about the spending of his life in the giving of his works and art to humanity, receiving nothing, resembles what van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo about the am- bivalence of his self-sacrifice: "I wanted only to give, but not to re- September 1996 JAE 50/1 58</page><page sequence="10">4.

Foolish, wrong, exaggerated, proud, rash-for in love one must not only give, but also take; and, receiving it, one must not only take but also give."83 Of course, van Gogh ultimately exhausted himself in self-sacrifice, as demanded by his art. In 1957, Nehru wanted Le Corbusier to "contribute an aes- thetic and plastic touch," in celebrating the "gigantic work of tech- nology," the hydroelectric dam at Bhakra in the Himalayas. On the summit of this dam, Le Corbusier intended to place his Open Hand, 17 meters high, 13 meters wide, as "a crowning feature." His main contribution was to be "the design for the balustrade on the top of the dam and the proposal to have his Open Hand monument as a crowning feature .... Le Corbusier had also proposed a plat- form for spectators 1700' above the spillway as at this point there 6. Andre Masson, Acdphale. ADAGP.

University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis. is an excellent view both upstream and downstream. Le Corbusier had been asked to do the planning of the building as well as the landscaping of the dam and the lake area. He had designed a mu- seum and was to have designed a cafeteria, a hotel, a motel, a tour- ist reception center and sport club.'"84 None of these projects materialized, and the posthumously built version of the Open Hand in Chandigarh was modeled after the 1951 version. In the 1959 edi- tion of L Art decoratifd'aujourd'hui, Le Corbusier described the ver- sion of the image of the Open Hand at Bhakra.85 The first proposed Open Hand of 1951 "was to be placed at the far northern and outer edge of the Capitol area and to be surrounded by the squared-off water pools of the Fosse and by the sunken public spaces intended for 'debates on public affairs."'86 The posthumous Le Corbusier Last 59 Lahiji</page><page sequence="11">Works and Sketchbooks record the early and later versions of the Open Hand; the posthumously constructed "final" design is based on images in the Last Works.87 Le Corbusier wrote about the image of the Open Hand and its unrealized dream shortly before his death: "This open hand, a sign of peace and reconciliation, must rise at Chandigarh. This sign which preoccupies me for a number of years in my subconscious should exist to bear witness to har- mony, . . . God and the devil-the forces present. The devil is in the way: the world of 1965 is able to put itself at peace. There is still time to chose, let's equip rather than arm. This sign of the open hand to receive the created riches, to distribute [them] to the peoples of the world, should be the sign of our epoch. Before find- ing myself one day (later on) in the celestial zones among the stars of the 'Bon Dieu' I would be happy to see at Chandigarh, before the Himalaya which rises up straight on the horizon, this open hand which marks for 'le pare Corbu' a deed, a course traversed."88 Notwithstanding the architect's own explanation, a Bataillean reading of the Open Hand should conceive of this sign as an alteration, analogous with the automutilation of the body of van Gogh. Should we conceive of the Open Hand as Le Corbusier's own severed hand, sacrificed to humanity in an act of potlatch with- out a return? The Open Hand is an unreturnable gift given by Le Corbusier to people in "misery" who cannot have it, as van Gogh's ear was an unreturnable gift of himself not to be received by any- one, only his painting. As Le Corbusier explained it, the Open Hand is a sign "to receive the created riches, to distribute them to the peoples of the world." Thus, Le Corbusier identifies himself with the Open Hand and, analogously, with the sun. His real gift and self-sacrifice was, as he claimed, his paintings, for which he re- ceived nothing in return. The Open Hand is not really an open hand, and it is not just a hand; it is an enigmatic hybrid. It is also a bird-a raven or "Corbu," an autobiographical reference to Le Corbusier himself. The hand is holding "Corbu" while transmut- ing it and preventing it from its attempting an Icarian flight. This sign, containing the allegory of modernity, parallels Walter Benjamin's Angelus Novus, which was a depiction of Benjamin's self.89 The Paul Klee drawing that Benjamin owned and dearly revered depicts the feebled flight of an angel, with open wings, obstructed by the rubble heaped in front of it. This autobio- graphical image of the new angel in Benjamin's "Thesis on the Phi- losophy of History" turns into the angel of history. The utopian flight to the future is halted by incessantly looking into the past. In the same manner, Le Corbusier's bird moves from its personal his- tory to a statement about modernity: The bird is held captive by the halting hand. To echo Tafuri's insight in '"Machine et memoire,'"' the Chandigarh Open Hand, "a new search for space of the utter- able," shatters here the impractical utopia of the Ville Radieuse. Both Benjamin's Angelus Novus and Le Corbusier's Open Hand are the emblems of modern tragedy.9" In this context, perhaps we now understand better Phillip Duboy's equation of Le Corbusier and Walter Benjamin as heroic figures in modernity. The heterogeneous body of the hand transmuted into the bird is a pharmakon." It is the signifier or the signature of Le Corbusier himself-one may say that it is an "acephalic body." In this sense, it is wrong to call the Open Hand a monument in the traditional sense. Rather, it might be conceived as sacrificial body in its "vertiginous fall from the vertical axis of the monument into the horizontal axis of the base.""92 This is how Bataille understood the term monument. It is, moreover, an autobiographical narration of the life of Le Corbusier. In his mature life, Le Corbusier came to realize what The Limits of Growth, in the Bataillean sense, meant: "But the terrestrial sphere (to be exact, the biosphere), which corre- sponds to the space available to life, is the only limit .... It is the size of the terrestrial space that limits overall growth.""93 The Open Hand is the manifesto of this limitation. It has been pointed out that Le Corbusier, in rereading Thus Spake Zarathustra in 1961, added the notation "la main ouverte" next to the passage "as a Christ like figure, descending to the level of humanity and voluntarily choosing to sacrifice himself in order to bring men the Truth.""94 The Open Hand, on the one hand, is the sign of the culmination of the "excessive waste," an expenditure and potlatch of Corbu; on the other, it is the "negative" sign of the impossibility of "architec- ture" in total dipense in the Chandigarh plan, at the same time that it is an indictment of Ville Radieuse in its limited circulation and utilitarian economy. The bird in the Open Hand knows that it can- not fly high. Once again, the bird's inability to fly must be under- stood in Bataille's dual conception of the sun in relation to the myth of Icarus. The raven ("Corbu" or Le Corbusier) is being held in place and motionless by another Le Corbusier, his severed hand, the sacrificial gift to humanity. Le Corbusier insistently makes us be- lieve that the story of his life is the story of his self-sacrifice for the "sake of humanity." However, there might be a fundamental differ- ence between Le Corbusier's gift of the Open Hand and that of Vincent van Gogh's gift of his mutilated body, symbolized by the sun in his painting, as interpreted by Bataille. This difference should be sought in the different conception of the sun. Let there be no mistake: An abyss separates Bataille and Le Corbusier, and that is the difference in their conception of the sun. For Le Corbusier, the sun is one pole of the cosmological union of oppo- sites in the duality between masculine and feminine, of which the September 1996 JAE 50/1 80</page><page sequence="12">moon constitutes the other pole; it is only a "real" entity. It is real in the sense that it is the real source of life, energy, and light; its emission of brightness was expressed partly in the notion of white- wash, or Ripolin. This sun, as such, is a positive element of life af- firmation; it can play no role in the notion of death and denegation. Such a concept of death would be utterly inconceivable for Le Corbusier and, for that matter, for an architect. The sun for Le Corbusier was also a sign of the Enlightenment, the sign of clarity and clear vision, not a sign of waste and darkness. Le Corbusier's vertical conception is expressed in the absolute ethical dimension of uprightness and the upright posture of the human body and in the notion of the right angle, according to which architecture became possible. If Le Corbusier talks about the horizontal axis or horizon in the right angle, it is always to subordinate it to the vertical axis. Le Corbusier's ambivalence and hostility against surrealists might lie precisely in this obsession with the vertical axis. In contrast, Bataille writes "in order to put out the light of the sun."" Bataille speaks of the vertical and the horizontal as the "two axes of terrestrial" life in his essay "The Pineal Eye."''96 According to John Lecht, "verticality can refer to the axis of transcendence, where transcendence refers to objectification, conceptualization, representation, distanciation, homogeneity, knowledge, history (as written or as narrative) and, more generally, to the domain of theory, especially in the sense of theoria: to see. Horizontality, on the other hand, refers to imma- nence, and thus, secondarily, to ritual, difference, horror, silence, heterogeneity, abjection (in Kisteva's sense) and, more generally, to the domain of nondiscursive, or practice.'97 Thus in Bataille, horizontality challenges the verticality and threatens it. The verti- cal always contains the void of the horizontal. In this valorization of horizontality in Bataille, the sun becomes "a series of transposi- tions: from egg to eye to testicle. The streams of light become streams of liquid: urine, tears, sperm, sweat."'"98 Roland Barthes elaborates this chain of metonymy in his interpretation of Bataille's Histoire de l'oeil.99 IV Further exploration of the notion of horizontality takes us deep into Bataille's oeuvre, which is outside the limit of this essay. However, I want to state that if the notion of the sun in Bataille is locked into the logic of ddpense, in contrast, the sun in Le Corbusier's thinking is locked into the logic of restricted economy. Nevertheless, we should consider the late work of Le Corbusier, especially the Chapel at Ronchamp and his later paintings, as symptoms in which one might trace some influence of the void of the horizontality in the constitution of the vertical axis. Le Corbusier read La Part Maudite during the conception of the Chapel of Ronchamp. It is at Ronchamp that Eros joins Logos in Le Corbusier's work and the theme of sexuality surfaces in his architecture. In the second paragraph of "Architecture" in the critical dic- tionary in Documents, Bataille wrote, "For that matter, whenever we find architectural construction elsewhere than in monuments, whether it be in physiognomy, dress, music, or painting, we can infer a prevailing taste for human or divine authority. The large- scale compositions of certain painters express the will to constrain the spirit within an official ideal. The disappearance of academic pictorial composition, on the other hand, opens the path to the expression (and thereby the exaltation) of psychological processes distinctly at odds with social stability. This, in large part, explains the strong reaction elicited, for over half a century, by the progres- sive transformation of painting, hitherto characterized by a sort of concealed architectural skeleton."'00 As Denis Hollier points out, this article does not concern it- self with architecture, but rather with its expansion.'0' Bataille wrote a book on Manet in which he discussed Olympia, painted by Manet in 1863. He argued that Manet destroyed academic painting and that it is with him that modernity came into being. By the destruc- tion of academic painting, Bataille meant the destruction of the "architecture" of the painting, which hitherto was under the con- trol of architecture-or, as Hollier says, academic painting was lim- ited to masking a skeleton.'02 Hollier writes, "In many primitive societies the skeleton marks the moment of the second death-a death that is completed, clean, and properly immutable: that which survives putrefaction and decomposition. The skeleton, as architec- tural, is the perfect example of an articulated whole. Modern paint- ing rediscovers death in its first guise of the human figure's decomposition, an incomplete death, a mortal wound to form, a rotting corpse rather than a skeleton. Rotten painting."'03 Here we should remember Bataille's essay on van Gogh, which connected his painting with the sun and the mutilation of the body as a sacrificial gift. As Hollier says, every sacrifice is more or less "transposed" automutilation: "Moreover, painting not only comes into being through a refusal to represent the human body, not only deforms the body in the images provided of it, but paint- ing, even at its origin, was in the most mechanical sense of the word the reproduction of mutilations actually practiced upon the body."'04 This shows that, as Rosalind Krauss writes, "The Minotaur, not Narcissus, presides over the birth of an art in which representation represents alteration."'05 61 Lahiji</page><page sequence="13">Throughout his life, Le Corbusier insisted that we should understand his architecture in the light of his paintings. Respond- ing to his call, we could say that painting "contaminated" his archi- tecture. Beyond the period of planisme, it was Le Corbusier as painter whom Bataille could have admired. The essays that Le Corbusier put together in the 1929 book The Decorative Art of To- day were the beginning of an unconscious attempt to "weaken" the architecture of the "skeleton." In this book, Le Corbusier shares Walter Benjamin's critique of nineteenth-century architecture.'o6 It was only later, in the Chapel of Ronchamp, that the destruction of the skeleton finds its manifestation. The chapel is the culmination of what, after Bataille and Holier, I would call "rotten architecture," analogous to "rotten painting." This needs to be explained. By the time the construction of the Chapel of Ronchamp be- gan in September 1953, Le Corbusier had nearly finished reading La Part Maudite. Le Corbusier's first sketches of the site and his first visit to the site of Ronchamp were in May and June 1950. The "de- ferred action" of Le Corbusier at Ronchamp has troubled his critics. They have often fallen into the same confusion as the reporter from the Chicago Tribune who, on the site of Ronchamp in 1955, asked, "Mr. Le Corbusier, in the name of the manager of the Chicago Tri- bune, answer this question: Was it necessary to be a Catholic to build this chapel?" Le Corbusier, angered by this question, arrogantly re- plied, "Foutez-moi le camp!"'07 James Stirling, more "sophisticated" than the Chicago Tribune reporter, in 1956-a year after the inau- guration of the building-wrote a piece that characterized Ronchamp as "the crisis of rationalism,"'0" believing that there is nothing in this building to satisfy intellect. Since then, critics have indulged in every conceivable structural and symbolic analysis of this building; it has been compared with almost everything.'09 Recently, as insightful a critic as Robin Evans, in an attempt to bring out the theme of sexuality for the first time in the criticism of Ronchamp, admits that outmoded dualistic terms no longer play a role in contemporary thought. Nevertheless, he resists this genre of contemporary criticism and constructs an argument about Ronchamp based on the same duality between male and female forms that we know in Le Corbusier's writing. Evans writes, "While these archaic dualisms play no direct part in contemporary thought, they do dramatize a tendency that still prevails in human affairs and is made almost inescapable through our use of language: the oppo- site of a man is a woman. Language enables us to deny this but makes affirmation easier." He continues, "Just look at the way in which our understanding of Le Corbusier's career is facilitated by pitting oppo- sites against one another: functionalism versus symbolism, the inter- national versus regional, the autocrat versus the populist, the technocrat versus the poet, rationality versus irrationality, progress versus origin, science versus myth, the machine versus the hand, cal- culation versus intuition, surface versus mass, the straight line versus the curved, geometric versus free form. It is a useful list, the more easily applied because most of these distinctions can be found in Le Corbusier's writings. .... Many judicious commentators point out that this picture of the two Corbusiers is oversimplified, but even those who reject it as a general explanation of his work often resort to it in explanation of Ronchamp, which is rightly regarded as an extreme case.""0' The most absurd extreme, perhaps, is the commen- tary of Jean Labatut, a Princeton professor, who in 1955 said, "Ronchamp expresses a liberation of Corbusier from Corbusier.""' True, Le Corbusier forces and imposes on the critic his own terms of duality in the explanation of his painting and work, but one should not submit to it in the practice of criticism, especially given the contemporary setting for thoughts. One still must go to Bataille's teaching, which would defy any easy classification, acknowledging that he is to a large extent behind our contemporary thinking. After all, it is not insignificant that Michel Foucault, who edited the first volume of Bataille's Oeuvres complktes, called him one of the most important writers of the twentieth century."13 After his commentary, Evans further elaborates the theme of sexuality in the building. On the one hand, he writes, "It's like the body of a woman; Stephen Gardiner, for example reckons that that's the only way to understand this building. ... The body of the building is womanly, according to the critical understanding." On the other hand, "There is a sense in which the actual act of construc- tion is very male. After all, this is hardly surprising; there is exactly what you would expect.""'3 Evans continues, "What about a synthe- sis? Corbusier was always making things into oppositions, present- ing them as complete oppositions, so that something could happen. That is the whole logic of this enterprise. The world is divided, and when the sun rises, the stars go out. But we're not talking about that now. We're just talking about good and bad architecture. Good architecture is male; bad is female, dangerous, too subjective. It is in the cloudy skies of the north that female architecture belongs, not in the clear skies of the south, with its rationality of precision.""''4 Further he writes, "A dangerous architecture seems to be turning the fully female province into a male preserve." 115 All of these commentaries are helpful, but they are lodged in the framework and habit of the metaphysical thinking of duality. One crucial question should be asked, which has remained unan- swered: Why does the theme of sexuality surface in a religious build- ing in Le Corbusier's oeuvre? Why does it emerge in the "mature work," what we call late Corbu? I want to suggest that it is only September 1996 JAE 50/1 82</page><page sequence="14">through the psychoanalytical notion of the deferred action or nachtriaglichkiet, that the action of Le Corbusier at Ronchamp can be explained. Sigmund Freud discussed this notion in "From the His- tory of an Infantile Neurosis," the famous Wolf Man case history."'6 Jacques Lacan first drew attention to this important notion in Freud."'7 In The Language of Psychoanalysis, J. Laplanche and J.-B. Pontalis define deferred action as "A term frequently used by Freud in connection with his view of psychical temporality and causality: experiences, impressions and memory-traces may be revised at a later date to fit in with fresh experiences or with the attainment of a new stage of development. They may in that event be endowed not only with a new meaning but also with psychical effective- ness.""" At its most elementary level, Ned Lukacher writes, "de- ferred action is a mode of temporal spacing through which the randomness of a later event triggers the memory of an earlier event or image, which might never have come to consciousness had the later event never occurred.""' Deferred action undermines the no- tion of linear causality in one temporal direction. Later events be- come the cause of earlier events and earlier events, become the effect of later events. We become what we are only in deferred action; the psychical temporality and causality, experiences and memory traces, are revised at a later date to fit in with the attainment of a new de- velopment. Subjectivity never rests; it is never set once and for all. Le Corbusier at Ronchamp reconstructs and anticipates a traumatic event: His body is more than a modular system. Excess in the body is more than the body itself. It is here that Le Corbusier rediscovers his own sexed body. He challenged anybody to find the modular system in Ronchamp, which was supposedly its male ele- ment, as Robin Evans declares. Some researchers and commentators have tried to "defeat" Le Corbusier in undertaking the challenge to find the hidden modular in the body of the building. They have labored hard and triumphantly, found some here and there, but perhaps they fell into the trap set up by the old magician. Perhaps in this search a point was missed. It is here specifically, and only here, that one should seek the relationship between the sexuality and the religious ecstasy as two interdependent categories of trans- gression. One should not look for the male element (the rational modular) in the otherwise female body of the building. Rather, one should seek to locate the transgressive potlatch of violent pleasure in the sacred ecstasy of the building-Le Corbusier's own experi- ence of "erotic sovereignty."'20 On Bataille's notion of eroticism, Michele H. Richman writes, "Eroticism is the ultimate d'pense, the sacrifice of self in the most complete gesture of communication."'' In the act of the sacrifice of rationality (the hidden modular), there looms a larger sacrifice. Le Corbusier is sacrificing his male identity and, in a self-indulgent act, recognizes and experiences himself in the ecstasy and jouissance of his sovereign d'pense. The "danger" in Ronchamp is not only that the "dangerous" feminine character is threatening the "male architecture." Rather, danger resides in the "surplus enjoyment"'122 resulting from the renunciation of the prin- ciple of reason and the law of utility in erotic ecstasy, in the sacred experience. This is not only beyond the reality principle, but also over and beyond the pleasure principle of "male architecture." Para- doxically, Le Corbusier could only attain the summit of this ecstasy in a religious building. This is why Le Corbusier replied impolitely to the Chicago Tribune reporter, whose question suggested the de- nial of his enjoyment of this deeply sacred experience on the day of the inauguration of Ronchamp, much less his erotic ecstasy. I suggest that it is the jouissance of transgression'23 (here trans- lated as "religious ecstasy"), coupled with "heterology" (here trans- lated as the "science of the sacred" in Bataille), that brings forward the elements of Bataille in Le Corbusier and makes them contem- porary with each other. The story of "Le Corbusier with Bataille," I suggest, is the site of Ronchamp. At Ronchamp, Le Corbusier's law of the l'angle droit (the "law" in the Lacanian sense) becomes the right of a passage to jouissance. Le Corbusier's early reading of Ernst Renan's Vie deJuses turns to meet his erotic side. Paradoxically, Le Corbusier could eroticize the chapel only through religious ecstasy. In this "dangerous" building, Le Corbusier dies of the "little death" in laughter. The death of the skeleton in the structure of the build- ing as the "second death" is, in fact, the disavowal by Le Corbusier of the upright body. The Chapel of Ronchamp is Le Corbusier's laughter in the experience of sovereignty and transgression. It is at Ronchamp that the repressed void of horizontality and baseness appears to threaten the vertical axis. V For George Bataille and Le Corbusier, art begins in the sacred. They both agreed that the vertical axis symbolizes humanity's pretension toward spirituality and the ethical. Whereas for Bataille the matrix of the sacred is in the violence and the horizontality of basses, for Le Corbusier the matrix of the scared resides in moral uprightness and verticality, in the right angle. This is the point that separates and con- nects these two contemporaries: On the one side stands Le Corbusier, who is for architecture, and on the other side stands Bataille, who is "against architecture." However, the scene of this opposition is not as simple as it sounds; this scene is stained by many intervening screens. After all, Bataille was an admirer of Le Corbusier. 63 Lahqt</page><page sequence="15">We might conclude that Bataille's admiration for Le Corbusier is returned to him by Le Corbusier's fascination with La Part Maudite. Le Corbusier, a thinker, dazzled by the sun, would affirm what Georges Bataille said, "I will speak briefly about the most general condition of life, dwelling on one crucially important fact: Solar energy is the source of life's exuberant development. The origin and essence of our wealth are given in the radiation of the sun, which dispenses energy-wealth-without any return. The sun gives without ever receiving. Men were conscious of this long before astrophysics measured the ceaseless prodigality; they saw it ripen the harvests and they associated its splendor with the act of someone who gives without receiving."'24 Bataille gave a gift to Le Corbusier; Le Corbusier never gave anything back. Instead, in this gift, he found himself in the orbit of solar energy with Bataille. Notes The research for this essay was completed at Fondation Le Corbusier in Paris in the summer of 1991. I thank Mme Evelyn Trehin, director of the founda- tion, who facilitated my research by making the documents available to me. I also thank Daniel Friedman for his intellectual support throughout the writing of this essay and for the painful task of reading early drafts with an editor's eye. I dedicate this essay to the memory of Manfredo Tafuri, whose reading of Le Corbusier's life and work influenced it. 1. Georges Bataille, La Part Maudite, essai d'economie general, la consumation (Paris: Les Edition Minuit, 1949). This volume, which is on "Consumption," is the first of a three-volume work on the general economy that has been translated into English by Robert Hurley as The Accursed Share (New York: Zone Books, 1991). In the 1976 French edition of the first volume, Bataille's essay, "La notion de depense," has been included. The English translation of this essay, "The Notion of Expendi- ture," appears in Allan Stoekl, ed., Georges Bataille, Visions of Excess, Selected Writ- ings, 1927-1939 (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1985), pp. 116-29. 2. The dedication bears no date and therefore makes it difficult to determine the exact date when Bataille offered his book to Le Corbusier. The only reference that I have come across regarding the offering of the book to Le Corbusier is the short commentary by Phillip Duboy in Le Corbusier, Une Encylopedie (Paris: Cen- tre Georges Pompidou, 1987), p. 67. Le Corbusier's copy of the book is kept in Fondation Le Corbusier in Paris. 3. Marcel Mauss, The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Soci- eties, trans. W.D.

[The following is the translation of Le Corbusier's handwritten remarks. The passage is elliptical and self-referential at best, and is open to further interpre- tations. In addition, because of the nature of handwritten passages, varient readings are possible. For example, assume could easily be read as assom, etc.-Ed.] The 5 volumes of Complete Works of Corbu have put forward, proposed, and asserted Le Corbusier's ideas with an enthusiatic following. From one camp, Corbu has been accepted by assholes, and from the other, he is king. The unselfish practice of painting is an unflagging sacrifice, a gift of time, patience, and love, expecting no material reward (except for modern merchants). This sowing to the wind is for un- known people. One day, before or after my death, they will say thank you. It is too late for so many setbacks in life. No matter; what matters is the key to happiness. This commentary appears on the second flyleaf of his copy and is preceded by the mark "P 92," which is the reference to page 92, Les Edition Minuit, 1949. Phillip Duboy cites the passage by suggesting that Le Corbusier wrote this commen- tary while he was reading the book on the flight to Punjab, Chandigarh. See Duboy, Le Corbusier. 6. Ibid., p. 67. 7. Duboy writes, "Cette 'petite reflection' de L.C. Devient alors une source evident de la Main Ouvertede Chandigarh, en meme temps qu'elle le ddfinit comme hero moderne. 'Le vrai sujet de la modernite. Cela signifie que pour vivre la modernite, il faut une nature hdroique': voila une bonne definition de Le Courbusier, que l'on doit " Walter Benjamin entre les deux guerres. Mais a la lecture de Bataille et aux reflections qu'en tire Le Courbusier on serait plut6t tente de le ddfinir, avec Jacques Lacan, comme un de ces heros modernes, 'qu'illustrent des exploits ddrisoires dan une situation d'dgarement."' ("This 'small reflection' by Le Corbusier is thus clearly a source of the Open Handin Chandigarh, at the same time that it defines him as a modern hero. 'The veritable subject of modernity. Which means, in order to live in modernity, one must have a heroic nature': This is an apt definition of Le Corbusier, which we owe to Walter Benjamin between the Wars. But, in reading Bataille and in the reflection drawn by Le Corbusier, one would rather tend to de- fine him, after Jacques Lacan, as one of these modern heroes: 'which illustrates the laughable achievements in a state of bewilderment."')

The reading of The Iliad preoccupied Le Corbusier until his death. He had planned to reillustrate his newly translated copy, which contained the drawings of John Flaxman, the eighteenth-century draftsman, but time did not allow him, and he completed no more than twenty-four drawings.

For my reflection on planisme and the Marshall Plan, I have benefited from the illuminating article by Allan Stoekl, "Truman's Apotheosis: Bataille, 'Planisme,' and Headlessness," in Yale French Studies 78 (1990): 181-205. In dis- cussing planisme, Stoekl makes references to Le Corbusier in two passages on which I have based my conjecture in tracing the origin of Bataille's acquaintance with Le Corbusier's activities in the thirties. 18. Ibid. 19. In the handwritten commentaries on the flyleaf of Le Corbusier's copy of the book, there are references to the chapter on potlatch. In the chapter on the Marshall Plan, Le Corbusier marked and underlined numerous passages. 20. See von Moos, "The Politics of the Open Hand. 21.

As McLeod informs us, Le Corbusier also partici- pated in another syndicalist journal, Prdlude (1933-1935). Both of these journals significantly contributed to the propagation of the ideas on urbanism that were a continuation of the earlier L 'Esprit Nouveau. "Le Corbusier himself was anxious to pursue the urban studies that he had commenced in L 'Esprit Nouveau. In fact, he proposed that Plans assume the remaining financial holdings of the earlier journal" (p. 186). 25. Ibid., p. 185. 26. Stoekl, "Truman's Apotheosis," p. 183. 27. Ibid. 28.

Entretiens) est anonyme: Bataille aurait fourni les dl'ments d'dlaboration du chapitre "Echanges et Credits" du ivre manifeste d'Arnaud Dandieu et Robert Aron, La Revolution nicessaire. Ce qui, a lire ce chapitre, parait en effet evident: la plupart des themes d'analyse de "La notion de depense" s'y retrouvent. Il ne semble cependant pas que Bataille ait redige ce chapitre. De meme qu'il ne semble pas, pour singuliere que soit cette collaboration anonyme et totalement desintdressee, qu'elle ait eu de suite. Bataille ne fit en tout cas jamais mention de tout cela" (p. 183). ("Bataille however did not take part in Ordre Nouveau. The only collaboration which has been recalled (in conversation with Pierre Prevost) is anonymous: Bataille would have provided elements of some elaborations in the chapter "Exchanges and Credits" in the book La Revolution ndcessaire by Arnaud Dandieu and Robert Aron. In reading this chapter, it becomes evident that a number of themes in the analysis of "The Notion of Expenditure" are found there. It however does not seem that Bataille wrote this chapter.") 29.

"This useless consumption is what suits me, once my concern for the morrow is removed. And if I thus consume immoderately, I reveal to my fellow beings that which I am intimately: Consumption is the way in which separate be- ings communicate. Everything shows through, everything is open and infinite be- tween those who consume intensely. But nothing counts then; violence is released and it breaks forth without limits, as the heat increases." Bataille, La Part Maudite, pp. 75-76; The Accursed Share, pp. 58-59. Le Corbusier marked the footnote re- lated to the passage after the word sipards, which reads: "J'insiste sur une donnie fondamentale: la separation des etres est limitee h l'ordre reel. C'est seulement si j'en reste a l'ordre des choses que la separation est rdele. Elle est en effet rdelle, mais ce qui est reel est extirieur. 'Tous les hommes, intimement, n'en sont qu'un."' ("I wish to emphasize a basic fact: The separation of beings is limited to the real order. It is only if I remain attached to the order of things that the separation is real.

Doubtless man on this side is not necessarily bound to follow the imperious ways of the USSR. For the most part, he is exhausting himself in the sterility of a fearful anti-communism. But if he has his own problems to solve, he has more important things to do than blindly anathematize, than to complain of a distress caused by his manifold contradictions. Let him try to understand, or better yet, let him admire the cruel energy of those who broke the Russian ground; he will be closer to the tasks that await him.

In other Indo-European languages, it is the notion of poi- son which is not certain. Kluge and the etymologists are right in comparing the potio, "Poison," series with gift, gift ["gift," which means "present" in English, means "poison" or "married" in other German languages.--Trans.]. One can also read with interest the lively discussion by Aulus-Gellius (12) on the ambiguity of the Greek pharmakon and the Latin venenum" (p. 133). Derrida relates the mean- ing of pharmakon (poison and remedy) to scapegoat and sacrifice, which comes close to Bataille's interpretation of gift related to his notion of sacrifice. 58.

Le Corbusier in 1956 at Camp Martin anecdotally wrote, "Ten days before the consecration [of the Chapel of Ronchamp] some journalists and photog- raphers had broken the rules. They virtually machined gunned me with their flash- cameras. I told the workmen near me: 'if these people don't get out of here immediately take them by the shoulders and...'

I replied 'Foutez-moi le camp!"' ["Get the bloody hell out of here!"] See Le Corbusier, The Chapel at Ronchamp (New York: Praeger, 1957), n.p. 108. "It may be considered that the Ronchamp chapel being a 'pure expres- sion of poetry' and the symbol of an ancient ritual, should not therefore be criticized by the rationale of the modern movement. Remembering, however, that this is a prod- uct of Europe's greatest architect, it is important to consider whether this building should influence the course of modern architecture. The sensational impact of the chapel on the visitor is significantly not sustained for any great length of time and when the emotions subside there is little to appeal to the intellect, and nothing to analyze or stimulate curios- ity [emphasis added]." James Stirling, "Ronchamp, Le Corbusier's Chapel and the Crisis of Rationalism," Architectural Review 711 (Mar. 1956) 161. Stirling is suspicious if Ronchamp should influence the course of modern architecture for the very fact that the building does not manifest any aspect of modernity. He thereby could only put Le Corbusier between the opposite poles of rationality and emotion, and from this con- clude that there is nothing for satisfaction of the intellect in this building. 109.
