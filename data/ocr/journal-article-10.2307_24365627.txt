James McKenna's Resurgence (Figs 1&amp;2) was com missioned by the Board of Thomond College of Education, an institution that was later acquired by the University of Limerick. Ken Thompson's Sundial (1985) and Peter Logan's Silver Pencils (Fig 6) were donated by Patrick Whelan and his fellow consultants on completion of Phase One and the Foundation Building respectively. Four works were commissioned in association with new buildings. Alexandra Wejchert's Geometric Forms (Fig 4) was commis sioned for the Robert Schuman Building, a publicly-funded academic building designed by Wejchert's brother Andrzej. Louise Walsh's The Diver (Fig 5) was commissioned for Kilmurry Village, funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and designed by Quinn Savage Smyth. Tom Fitzgerald's Leaf Litany (Fig 3) and Antony Gormley's Together and Apart (Fig 7) were associated with the library project, funded sub stantially by Lewis L Glucksman and Atlantic Philanthropies, and designed by Murray O Laoire. Three pieces had no direct connection with campus buildings. Michael Warren's Salmon Fall (Fig 9) was commissioned for the lawn in front of Plassey House. The flagpoles and Sean Scully's Crann Saoilse (The Wall of Light) were the essential components of de Blacam and Meagher's main entrance (Fig 9). Finally, Chancellors' Walk is a commemorative project inaugurated in 2008 in the colonnade of the Millstream Courtyard. Three of these works were given the task of representing institutional aspiration. McKenna's Resurgence, a large limestone sculpture1 in which eight figures are displayed in three defined sets like a tableaux vivants, represents the tri umph of Irish education through the use of national, politi 4 cal and mythological symbols.
