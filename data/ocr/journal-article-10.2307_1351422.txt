<plain_text><page sequence="1">Estuaries Vol. 9, No. 4B, p. 382-383 December 1986 Book Reviews Microfauna Marina. Vol. 2. Edited by P. Ax. Gustav Fischer, Stuttgart, New York. 1986. 410 p. 89 DM. The marketing strategy of Microfauna Marina con- tinues to be somewhat strange. Each volume is pub- lished with a hard cover, and announcements are in- cluded among textbooks. The second volume is not a text or handbook on marine meio- or microfauna. In fact, Microfauna Marina is a journal that continues the previous series Mikrofauna des Meeresbodens. "Pri- marily, the journal serves to publish research of the Commission of Zoology of the Mainz Academy of Sci- ence and Literature" (from the Foreword of the editor, Peter Ax, in Vol. 1). Not every scientist will be able to apply for funds at the mentioned Academy since funds are only available for selected members. Peter Ax (jour- nal editor) is the only one of these members working on marine meiofauna. This may be the reason that all papers published in Vols. 1 and 2 are written by authors associated with Ax's working group. In Vol. 1 Peter Ax announced that each volume would contain a review article. Indeed, competently written review articles may be very stimulating, es- pecially when they promote new ideas and criticize commonly accepted views. Unfortunately, neither of the available volumes contains a review article. Editor and publisher are earnestly requested not to disappoint readers of Microfauna Marina and to include a review article in each of the following volumes. The present Vol. 2 contains 15 papers, 7 in English and 8 in German. They all deal with marine meiofaunal groups from Europe as well as from North and South America. The subjects covered include structure and function (5 papers), taxonomy (7 papers), and ecology (3 papers). Editing and printing quality are very good. The papers will not be discussed in further detail since it is not usual to review entire volumes of journals. SIEVERT LORENZEN Zoological Institute University Kiel D-2300 Kiel I West Germany Fish Endocrinology. By A. J. Matty. Timber Press, Portland, Oregon. 1985. $27.95. This book is a welcome updating and integration of the current knowledge of fish endocrinology. It is writ- ten mainly for students of aquaculture, fisheries and fish biology. The essentials of fish endocrinology, here- tofore scattered in the general literature or texts on comparative endocrinology (textbook of Comparative Endocrinology by Gorgman and Bern, Wiley, NY and Comparative Vertebrate Endocrinology by Bentley, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge), are sum- marized into a single, small, readable and well-illus- trated volume. Fish Endocrinology is organized in terms of endo- crine functions, not organ systems and evolutionary relationships. It assumes a "basic knowledge of en- docrinology, relevant anatomy, physiology and bio- chemistry." Chapter 1 deals with the anatomy, cytology, and endocrine physiology and biochemistry of the pituitary in lampreys, hagfishes, sharks (elasmobranchs), ratfish (Holocephalan) and the bony fishes. A section on the pituitary anatomy and cytology of the living fossil, La- timeria, and the primitive lungfish is also included. The amino acid sequences, functions, and controls of some of the pituitary hormones of these fishes as com- pared with those of mammals provides the student with the essential perspective. The thyroid and its hor- mones, pancreas and gastrointestinal hormones, ad- renals and kidney hormones, and the gonadal hor- mones are covered in Chapters 2-6 using the same general approach as outlined for Chapter 1. The Cor- puscles of Stannius and urophysis-their role in elec- trolyte and blood pressure regulation-and the light sensitive pineal gland are discussed in Chapter 6. Chap- ters 7 and 8 are devoted to pheromones and hormones involved in migration. Finally, the book ends with an important chapter presenting recent work on the use of various hormones in aquaculture (e.g., human cho- rionic gonadotropin for spawning; and growth hor- mone, thyroxine, and testosterone for enhanced feed- ing and growth). There is no attempt at a complete review of the literature but an annotated bibliography, the well laid out tables and charts, and the high quality printing and binding make this book a good value for the $27.95 price.

Tidewater Publishers, Centreville, Maryland. 1986. 237 p. $16.95. This book seems to be designed and illustrated to entertain the nonscientist who visits the Maryland por- tion of Chesapeake Bay and wishes to know more about oysters. The overall organization of the book mixes oyster biology and management economics with folksy tales of the oyster fishermen and farmers. While there are interesting points for biologist and layman, the book has a number of features which will ? 1986 Estuarine Research Federation 382 01 60-8347/86/04B0382-02$01.50/0</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 383 not endear it to a scientist or a teacher. The introduc- tion of technical terms with no definition or a definition several pages later is unsettling. The interjection of seemingly unimportant facts (i.e., a discussion on pearl oysters) is confusing especially to a nonscientist. Fi- nally, I can't condone the use of anthropomorphic al- lusions such as "proud possessor of two ovaries." The discussions of oyster structure, life cycles, di- versity, diseases, parasites and predators seem to de- pend mainly on one or two individual scientific reports like Galtsoff's (1964) treatise which is cited and ref- erenced and Well's (1961) monograph which is refer- enced but not cited. Unfortunately, much of the recent literature is not incorporated even though Kennedy and Breisch's (1981) compendium on Maryland's oys- ters is listed in the selected bibliography. One novel idea is presented on the use of oysters as filters to clean up Chesapeake Bay. Although the sci- entific support is not well developed, the possibility is worthy of investigation and discussion considering the central processing role oysters have in estuarine nu- trient cycling. Jonathan Swift is often quoted for "He was a bold man who first ate an oyster." In that time, the oysters were in highly polluted (plague, etc.) waters near Lon- don and a person might unknowingly have been risking his life to eat raw oysters. Today, it will be a bold estuarine scientist who pays $16.95 for this book for his/her personal or institutional library. LITERATURE CITED GALTSOFF, P. S. 1964.
