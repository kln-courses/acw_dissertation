<plain_text><page sequence="1">The "Crowned Republic" of Tennyson's Idylls of the King RICHARD D.MALLEN THE EVE OF THE SECOND REFORM ACT OF 1 867 , WALTER BAGEHOT announced that England had become a "disguised republic." Accord- ing to Bagehot, England's transformation from constitutional monarchy to republic, which began in the years after the First Reform Act of 1832, re- mained hidden from the "masses" because they mistook the unabated pomp and circumstance of royalty - its "theatrical show" - for actual political power. Bagehot argued that this monarchical disguise was useful because England existed in a state of "unstable equilibrium." Unless "the mob," which was not ready for republican citizenship, continued to believe in the "charmed spectacle" of monarchical power, it would lose its habitual deference to the "cultivated" or "select few," and social unrest would ensue. Unfortunately, however, this noble lie of royal power was being rendered increasingly tenu- ous by the crass populism of "demagogues" and "newspapers."1 As Bagehot's analysis suggests, the more than forty years that Tennyson spent composing Idylls of the King - from 1842 to 1885 - correspond to a most anxious moment in the evolution "of the King" in modern England. Like Bagehot, Tennyson recognized the need to maintain a "charmed spec- tacle" of monarchy, but unlike Bagehot, he sought to use the mythicizing "word" of the poet laureate to underwrite this noble lie and to bring it more into the open. Tennyson's masterpiece thus both reflects the lost reality of monarchical power in post-Reform England and helps shape the consola- tory fiction of the figurehead-monarch that England increasingly needs as the masses gain more and more power. By ultimately portraying Arthur as a figurehead - a purely symbolic sovereign who commands only the collec- tive imagination of the people - Tennyson helps give England a truly stable political equilibrium in which the fictive nature of monarchy can be ac- knowledged and celebrated by all citizens of the new republic, the many as well as the few. 2 Tennyson pursues this dual strategy by portraying two Arthurs: the mortal, flesh-and-blood man; and the immortal, Christlike, once-and- future king. Appropriately, the latter mythic Arthur tends to overwhelm the former, most notably causing Guinevere to yearn for the more 275</page><page sequence="2">276 1 VICTORIAN POETRY flesh-and-blood manliness of Lancelot. As she recalls in Guinevere, Arthur is simply too much of an ideal king: "cold, / High, self-contained, and pas- sionless, not like him / 'Not like my Lancelot'" (1L 402-404)-3 Tennyson himself was concerned that he had overstated this imbalance, and in his last revision to the Idylls in 1891, he inserted a line in "To the Queen" making clear that Arthur's "Ideal manhood" is "closed in real man" (1. 38). Critics have long emphasized Arthur's duality, not only in terms of Tennyson's personal life (King Arthur as a sublimated representation of Arthur Hallam), but also in broader thematic terms of religion, politics, genre, and gender. John D. Rosenberg does perhaps the best job of explain- ing how the "inevitable duality in Arthur's character" is patterned on "the paradoxical nature of Christ, the stern Judge and forgiving Son," the mor- tal man and the immortal ideal. This religious duality produces two kinds of narrative time in the Idylls. Arthur is both a Christlike figure who repre- sents a Biblical sense of linear, historical time, and a "solar deity" who em- bodies a more primitive sense of cyclical time. These two senses of time, of course, manifest themselves in different narrative or generic modes within the idylls. As Rosenberg points out, "by linking the separate idylls to the cycle of seasons, Tennyson transposes the dominant mode of Arthurian myth from romance to tragedy, in which the only release from time is death."4 Building on Rosenberg, critics have often emphasized some duality or ten- sion in Arthur's "gendered sexuality," and this tension has in turn been frequently linked to politics, either to Victorian sexual politics or to the politics of empire.5 As these diverse interpretations suggest, critics have not found a way to negotiate between the abstract principle of Arthur's duality ("ideal man- hood" versus "real man"), which is so vague as to apply to all men, and the endless particular manifestations of Arthur's duality, which are so varied and even contradictory as to be confusing. From the perspective of gender alone, Arthur emerges as simultaneously female, patriarchal, homoerotic, and androgynous. 6 This critical dilemma is not accidental, for it reflects Tennyson's own dilemma as the chief poetic representative of the Victorian public: on the one hand, a typically Victorian desire to bridge the rift be- tween the one and the many, mind and nature, abstract ideal and particu- larist reality; on the other hand, an equally typical Victorian suspicion both of unrealistic idealism and unidealistic materialism. As Isobel Armstrong observes, Robert Browning solves this same di- lemma by repeatedly exploiting the legal fiction, for in the legal fiction Browning finds an entity that is both fictional and real, both a delusive verbal construct and an objective reality of legal practice that produces tangible, real-world consequences. By providing "a subtle route through the philosophical extremes of nominalism and realism, the independence</page><page sequence="3">RICHARD D. MALLEN / 277 of language from the world, and the referentiality which ties words to things," the legal fiction allows Browning to craft a new poetics and a new politics.7 Tennyson also relies on the legal fiction, but in a way that is left al- most entirely implicit. Armstrong implies that legal fictions gain real-world currency by being abundantly repeated and redescribed in the public forum (p. 151). What she overlooks is that some fictions have become so current that they go without saying; they do not need to be explicitly reproduced in the public forum, for they already constitute the nation's true constitution or collective conscience. In the Idylls, Tennyson makes use of precisely this kind of legal fiction, the key fiction that defined kingship in England for centuries. By dragging this fiction, like some long-slumbering juristic Kraken, close to the surface of his poetry (causing key words like "king," "head," and "crown" to ripple in its wake), Tennyson compels the public to confront its own "slowly-grown" "common-sense" of political authority, and to contem- plate the upheaval that may result from its casual abandonment in an age of democracy ("To the Queen," 11. 60, 61). The legal fiction that governs the Idylls is known as "the king's two bodies," or the fiction that the king is "a corporation sole," and like the Kraken it does appear bizarre and grotesque when first brought to the light of day. The status of the king as a corporation sole fascinated several con- temporary jurists of Tennyson's day, especially the great legal historian F. W. Maitland, who was born in the year Tennyson became poet laureate, and who repeatedly wrote about the subject in his essays and in the magnum opus that he co-authored with Sir Frederic Pollock, The History of English Law.8 There is no need to insist Tennyson had actually read juristic ac- counts of this fiction, for as Ernst Kantorowicz shows in his masterful The Kings Two Bodies, this legal fiction had deeply permeated the English con- sciousness, appearing especially in Renaissance literature, including Shakes- peare, and persisting in the folk mind through the saying, "The king is dead; long live the king."9 Kantorowicz thus provides a useful starting point to elucidate not the legal technicalities but the general features of this legal fiction as appre- hended by a sharp mind like Tennyson's confronting the increasing fictionality of the monarch's authority in Victorian England. The fiction of the king's two bodies originates in the medieval notion that the king stood in between two kinds of law: a transcendent ideal of unwritten natural law (a reflection of the divine logos or ratio), and fallible human attempts to codify that ideal in some "positive" form. Over time, this sense of the king's double link to both natural and positive law, divine and human justice, eventually evolved into a complex legal fiction of the king's two bodies. The king was seen as possessing a mortal and physical "body natural" (corpus naturale) like any man, but was also seen as the "head" of the "body</page><page sequence="4">278 I VICTORIAN POETRY mystical" (corpus mysticum or corpus republicae mysticum), the body politic of the kingdom or republic. The king eventually came to be seen as a "cor- poration sole," a fictional legal entity comprised at any one time of only a single person who is also a corporate person whose plurality of members unfolds temporally, comprising the entire past and future succession of kings. Through the fiction of the corporation sole, the king becomes both mortal and immortal; the body natural of the king dies, but the body mystical (which is immortal, immutable, invincible, and inalienable) immediately transmi- grates to the new king. The body mystical is also sexless, and is often repre- sented in formulaic phrases by the genderless synechdoche "the crown," which emphasizes that the monarch is the "head" of the body politic. The fiction of the king's two bodies helps reintegrate our sense of Arthur as a complete or perfect man rather than a schizophrenic amalgam of religious, political, generic, and gendered personae. Arthur is Christlike because his legal status as king is ultimately based - like the idea of the king's two bodies - on an analogy to Christ, who also had a body natural and a body mystical. Arthur is also linked to empire because of the bound- less, universal extent of his corpus mysticum\ indeed, the modern legal cat- egory of the corporation evolved out of the medieval legal category of the universitas, and when applied to the king implied a natural link to the uni- versal empire of Christ. As both mortal king and immortal King, Arthur is also naturally linked to different senses of time, which manifest themselves in different narrative modes in the Idylls. Finally, it is not surprising that Arthur seems either androgynous or a "female king," for insofar as he is sexless he is merely representing the genderless "crown," and insofar as he is female he is representing the ideal of justice; throughout the middle ages and beyond, the monarch was seen as the living "image of justice" or the "image of equity," and as either justice (iustitia), equity (aequitas), or the Nature (natura) that justice and equity were derived from, the king natu- rally possessed a feminine persona. More important than its relation to modern criticism, however, is the light the fiction of the king's two bodies shines on the Bagehot-like "charmed spectacle" of Arthur's kingship. It is this fiction that explains, for instance, why the first two references to kingship in the Idylls have different orthog- raphies: King versus king. The first line of The Coming of Arthur refers to Leodogran as "the King," while the fifth line speaks of "many a petty king." The different capitalizations persist throughout the Idylls and can in part be explained as reflecting the difference between the official title of "King," usually referring to a specific person like Leodogran, and the general status of "king," usually referring to unidentified persons or a metaphoric king- ship, as in "reverenced his conscience as his king" ("Dedication," 1. 7). Still, these orthographic alternations also point to an inherent duality in</page><page sequence="5">RICHARD D. MALLEN / 279 kingship - body natural versus body mystical10 - especially since capitaliza- tion does not always seem tied to the difference between specific versus general kingship-11 In fact, there is a pointed irony in the issue of capitaliza- tion (derived from the Latin caput or "head") first arising in the phrase "Their king and head." The phrase is not just a vague honorific or rhetori- cal tautology, where two titles are better than one; rather, it has a specific legal history tied to the fiction of the king's two bodies. In such a phrase, the term "king" refers to Arthur's body natural, the fact that a specific natural person has assumed the mantle of kingship, while the term "head" refers to Arthur's body mystical, the fact that he stands at the head of the immortal body politic. As Kantorowicz shows, medieval and Renaissance jurists devised various phrases to emphasize both the uninterrupted line of royal bodies natural and the immortality of the body politic, with the term "head" and later "crown" being the key signifier of the latter aspect of the fiction (pp. 3 14-450). 12 This duality arises to indicate the continuity of dy- nastic succession: to solve the legal difficulties regarding the continuity of "realm" that arose when there was a kingless interregnum (p. 335). Appro- priately, Tennyson designates Arthur "King" only after first describing the sporadic rules of prior kings, often interrupted by "the heathen host" (The Coming of Arthur, 1. 8). Because Arthur is truly a King - said by Bedivere and Bellicent to have appeared as heir at the very moment when King Uther is dying (11. 208-21 1, 365-385) - he can truly be said to have "made a realm," a continuous body politic ruled by "king and head" (1. 19). The body politic is not composed of the head alone, however; it also has "members" or "limbs," and only the head and limbs together can truly make a realm.13 For this reason, Tennyson emphasizes that it is "thro' the puissance of his Table Round" that Arthur "made a realm," for the knights of the Round Table are the limbs of Arthur's body politic (The Coming of Arthur, 11. 17, 19). Lancelot above all epitomizes this aspect of knightly membership, and for this reason the reader first encounters Lancelot not as a named individual, but in synecdochic form as the king's "arm": "He [Arthur] laughed upon his warrior whom he loved / And honoured most. 'Thou dost not doubt me King, / So well thine arm hath wrought for me today'" (11. 124426). Although this relation between knightly arm and kingly head allows Arthur and Lancelot to seal a mutual bond of trust, Arthur and his knights are able to coalesce as "one will" only "for a space" (11. 514, 515). By de- scribing Arthur as "head" instead of the stronger "Crown," Tennyson not only retains a more authentically medieval corporeal distinction between the "head" and the "members" of the body politic, he also highlights the tenuous corporate fiction that allows the King to rule. Although images of the people as "one will" or "one tide of joy" can make Tennyson seem pro to-</page><page sequence="6">280 1 VICTORIAN POETRY fascist, such tendencies can be more immediately explained as growing out of the increasing desuetude of the fiction of the Crown as corporation sole. In the "disguised republic" that emerges after 1832, the Crown increasingly becomes purely a fiction, not the head of the body politic but the figure- head, useful only to appease the masses with the fiction or "theatrical show" of power. As a corporation sole, the Crown becomes less the potent fiction of the mystical incorporation of the body politic than a freak of legal his- tory, arguably deserving the derision of a Maitland or a Pollock.14 Tennyson, however, views this fiction more sympathetically, beginning with the Dedication's poignant reference to the Crown as "a lonely splendour" (1. 48). This phrase refers to a Queen who not only has lost her spouse, but also must endure her lonely anachronism as a corporation sole in an age where the corporate fiction is useful and respected only as means to secure monetary profit. Tennyson captures the disenchanting of the Crown most poignantly in Balin and Balan, the last idyll he composed, which parabolically portrays the "unstable equilibrium" of the Bagehot-like polity. In Bagehot's world, the Crown assumes a new and unstable duality. From the point of view of the elite, it is a pious fraud, a "mere" fiction to be cynically manipulated in order to pacify the restive masses; from the point of view of the masses, it is an iconic symbol of personal leadership, a repository of charismatic power that promises to rehumanize an increasingly bureaucratic and mass-market age.15 In Balin and Balan, the unstable equilibrium of these contradictory views breaks down. When Balin asks to bear the Queen's crown upon his shield, Arthur replies, "Thou shalt put the crown to use. / The crown is but the shadow of the King, / And this a shadow's shadow, let him have it, / So this will help him of his violences!'" (11. 198-201). Arthur here dismissively refers to the mere image or emblem of the physical crown (not the idea of "the Crown"), but his emphasis on the "use" of this image resembles the instrumentalism of the Bagehot-like elite, who also desire to use the mythic image of the crown to allay the "violences" of the masses. In their virtual identity of appearance and name, Balin and Balan represent the homoge- neous masses of Victorian England, and in their fatal relation to the slan- derous Vivien and the "wood demon" of scandal and rumor, they represent the monstrous forces of public opinion.16 In keeping with this populist iden- tity, Balin expresses an idolatrous reverence toward the crown: '"No shadow' said Sir Balin 'O my Queen, / But light to me! no shadow, O my King, / But golden earnest of a gentler life!'" (11. 202-204). In this aspiration toward a "gentler life," Tennyson subtly alludes to the simmering class tensions me- diated and suppressed by the image of the crown; indeed, Balin himself recognizes that while he can never attain the nobility of a Lancelot, whose aristocratic "gifts" are "Born with the blood" and "Beyond my reach," he</page><page sequence="7">RICHARD D. MALLEN / 281 nonetheless can try to better himself through the "worship of the Queen" (11 170-172, 175). When Balin discovers the Queen's "secret" infidelity, however, he violently rejects the crown he had so eagerly sought. Symboli- cally, Bagehot's "secret" of the constitution has been found out, or rather outed by the forces of public opinion, and the result is a monstrous literal- ization of the king's two bodies - the two corpses that betoken the fratri- cidal strife that the crown can no longer control. This dark scenario is only dimly glimpsed in The Coming of Arthur, where Tennyson sets out to renew an archaic sense of the mystic splendor of the Crown. The strongest image of the corpus mysticum, the incorpo- rated body politic, appears when Bellicent describes what Bleys (Merlin's former master) had told her of Arthur's birth. Bleys and Merlin had Beheld, so high upon the dreary deeps It seemed in heaven, a ship, the shape thereof A dragon winged, and all from stem to stern Bright with a shining people on the decks, And gone as soon as seen. (11. 372-376) Tennyson paints more than a fanciful image of fellow-ship here, for this ship of shining people resembles a dragon, which has earlier been identified as the "golden symbol" of Arthur's "kinglihood" (1. 50). Known as the "dread Pendragon," Arthur is associated at various places in the Idylls with the dragon symbol, which is "The Dragon of the great Pendragonship" (Lancelot and Elaine, 1. 422; Guinevere, 1. 395). For a fleeting moment this Pendragon-ship reveals the true promise of the King it symbolizes, the abil- ity of his body politic to incorporate the people into a shining fellowship. Significantly, the dragon - unlike the various other animal images in the Idylls - is a purely fictional beast; as a fictional symbol of kingship and in- corporation, the dragon ultimately resembles the legal fiction of the king's two bodies. By emphasizing that the dragon is "winged" and thus able to fly, Tennyson draws on one of his favorite tropes: the association of winged flight with the liberation of the soul or moral imagination from sense or the confines of the body. In the fleeting image of the winged dragonship, Tennyson brilliantly captures the essence of the legal fiction of the king's two bodies: the idea that the corpus mysticum, the king-as-corporate-sym- bol, can soar free of the limitations of the corpus naturale, the king-as-car- nal-being, and thereby bless the realm with something of the "high and holy" ("To the Queen," 1.66).17 Unfortunately, this early image of the dragon-ship captures only the fiction of Arthur's kingship; the reality of incorporation proves increasingly unstable, and the Idylls increasingly emphasizes limbs or members so as to indicate the dismemberment of the body politic. Thus, in The Coming of Arthur the Lady of the Lake appears in full-bodied glory, standing and</page><page sequence="8">282 / VICTORIAN POETRY "Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful," with "incense curled about her" and her face almost "hidden in the minster gloom" (11. 284, 287, 288). Arthur takes Excalibur not from the Lady but from the "bosom of the lake," as if the lake also is a fully corporeal being (1. 296)- In Gareth and Lynette, she is still full-bodied, but only as a sculpted form on the magical gate to Camelot (11 210-219)- Later, in Lancelot and Elaine, the Lady appears less full-bodied, with only her arms emphasized: "Mine own name shames me, seeming a reproach, Lancelot, whom the Lady of the Lake Caught from his mother's arms - the wondrous one Who passes through the vision of the night - She chanted snatches of mysterious hymns Heard on the winding waters, eve and morn She kissed me saying, 'Thou art fair, my child, As a king's son,' and often in her arms She bare me." (11.13924400) This passage foreshadows the separation of Arthur from his "right arm" Lancelot, for Lancelot is here portrayed in terms of separation - from his name and his mother - just as the Lady of the Lake is portrayed piecemeal in terms of her arms and "snatches" of song. Finally, in The Passing of Arthur, Arthur gives a revised account of how he first took Excalibur, in the process reducing the Lady of the Lake to a single arm: "I am so deeply smitten through the helm That without help I cannot last till morn. Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur, Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how In those old days, one summer noon, an arm Rose up from out the bosom of the lake, Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, Holding the sword." (11. 193-200) In this account, which is appropriately based on what Arthur "rememberest," there is technically no Lady of the Lake; instead of her full body, Arthur merely describes "an arm" of an unidentified and hidden person who has been largely merged into the anthropomorphized "bosom of the lake." As this passage also indicates, however, Arthur himself has become more full-bodied in The Passing of Arthur. Instead of the anthropomorphic abstraction of head or crown, Tennyson thrice emphasizes how Arthur has been smitten on the "helm," as if to demonstrate how the unincorporation of the realm is balanced by the eleventh-hour "incorporation" of Arthur as a mortal body natural, whose physical head needs the protection of armor (11. 166, 193, 209). (The smiting of the helm also suggests the destruction of the mystic Pendragon-ship, which is now set adrift with no one at the helm. ) Like Aeneas' father Anchises, Arthur must then have his very physi-</page><page sequence="9">RICHARD D. MALLEN / 283 cal "weight" carried on Bedivere's shoulders to the barge, where his body natural suffers a kind of poetic dismemberment. When the three Queens tend to the wounded king, the various parts of his body are catalogued more fully than anywhere else in the work: head, hands, brow, face, curls, forehead, and mustache (11. 332, 375-388). Two related scenes best capture the contrast between the Crown as signifier of divine incorporation, and the crown as signified of political dis- memberment. The first occurs in The Coming of Arthur, when we first see Arthur sitting as a crowned king. Tennyson does not depict the actual crowning of Arthur,18 but he does have Bellicent describe the equally au- gust moment when, fresh from defeating "Uther's peerage" (1. 256), Arthur - who appears as "the king" in one line and "the King" in the next (11. 258, 259) - "sat / Crowned on the dais" and bound the knights of the Round table with "strait vows to his own self (11. 256-257, 261). By thus progress- ing from Arthur's self-division to his possession of a unitary "self," this pas- sage highlights Arthur's triumphant power at the moment of his crowning, his temporary ability to bring even the cultural realm of legal fiction under his authority. This holistic sense of power is given a communal dimension by Bellicent's description of what happens next: "But when he spake and cheered his Table Round With large, divine, and comfortable words, Beyond my tongue to tell thee - I beheld From eye to eye through all their Order flash A momentary likeness of the King: And ere it left their faces, through the cross And those around it and the Crucified, Down from the casement over Arthur, smote Flame-colour, vert and azure, in three rays." (The Coming of Arthur, 11. 266-274) In these passages the crown, mentioned only as a preliminary detail, almost goes without saying, presiding as the demure signifier of a fiction of the collective conscience. The knights are literally enlightened into con-sci- ence, a common knowledge of divine law mediated through the prism of Arthur's Kingly authority. As a result, the knights become "all of one mind with" Arthur, passing from disordered individualism into the Ordered and metonymic identity of the Table Round (1. 254)- In contrast to the demure crown in The Coming of Arthur, the crown of Lancelot and Elaine has a most tangible and unsettling presence. The crowned Arthur sits not beneath an incorporating mystic light, but be- neath a canopy that contains a crassly "blaz[ing]" diamond from a dismem- bered crown, itself the legacy of ancient fratricidal strife (1. 442). Arthur himself is wearing a crown with a dragon on it, but this dragon - unlike its</page><page sequence="10">284 1 VICTORIAN POETRY predecessor in The Coming of Arthur - does not seem to be winged, and in fact is forced to "cl[i]ng" precariously to the crown (1. 432). The diamond in the canopy, which Arthur has earlier designated "For public use" (1. 60), presides as the gross res publica of a disenchanted king, whose good name has by now passed into the basest kind of public use, namely the rumor and gossip instigated by Vivien, whose triumph over Merlin has just been de- scribed at the end of the preceding idyll. The history of the crown that once held the diamond appears at the beginning of the idyll, where the narrator describes how Arthur, "long be- fore they crowned him King," "Had found a glen" where an ancient king and his brother had slain each other: And down they fell and made the glen abhorred: And there they lay till all their bones were bleached, And lichened into colour with the crags: And he, that once was king, had on a crown Of diamonds, one in front, and four aside. And Arthur came, and labouring up the pass, All in a misty moonshine, unawares Had trodden that crowned skeleton, and the skull Brake from the nape, and from the skull the crown Rolled into light, and turning on its rims Fled like a glittering rivulet to the tarn: And down the shingly scaur he plunged, and caught, And set it on his head, and in his heart Heard murmurs, "Lo, thou likewise shalt be King." (11. 34, 36, 42-55) Chilling in its own right, this passage also bears an ominous resemblance to Bagehot's description of the "unstable equilibrium" facing the English re- public circa 1867: A deferential community in which the bulk of the people are ignorant, is therefore in a state of what is called in mechanics unstable equilibrium. If the equilibrium is once disturbed there is no tendency to return to it, but rather to depart from it. A cone balanced on its point is in unstable equilibrium, for if you push it ever so little it will depart farther and farther from its position and fall to earth. So in communities where the masses are ignorant but respectful, if you once permit the ignorant class to begin to rule you may bid farewell to deference for ever. Their demagogues will inculcate, their newspapers will recount, that the rule of the existing dynasty (the people) is better than the rule of the fallen dynasty (the aristocracy), (p. 251) Instead of serving as the resplendent physical symbol that likens the an- cient king to a corpus mysticum, the crown over which Arthur stumbles has become a mere unobserved appurtenance to the all-too-mortal "lichened" remains of the king's corpus naturale. This unhealthy imbalance between the crown's two symbolic roles, which is reflected in the unequal distribu- tion of its diamonds, causes the crown to exist in a Bagehot-like unstable equilibrium. Not only does the crown, once disturbed by Arthur, fall farther</page><page sequence="11">RICHARD D. MALLEN / 285 and farther from its position, but Tennyson artfully associates this fall with the nascent rule of "the ignorant class." Arthur does not here appear in an aristocratic role but rather must "labour" like a common workman whose lack of education causes him to "pass" through life "unawares" of its nobler aspects (11 47-48). Harsh monosyllables like "glen" and "scaur" (of Scot- tish origin), "tarn" and "skull" (of Scandinavian origin), "bones" and "brake" (of AngloSaxon origin), "crag" (of Celtic origin) and "nape" (appropriately, of obscure origin) likewise reflect a more demotic idiom associated with either unsophisticated lands (far removed from the nineteenth-century cultural centers of London and Paris) or unsophisticated times (the primi- tive roots of pre -Norman England). Most chillingly, the "murmurs" that Arthur hears at the end of the passage reflect the dark forces of rumor and public opinion that, in the nineteenth century, are marshalled by Bagehot's twin demons of "dema- gogues" and "newspapers." By the seventh idyll, Tennyson suggests, the auspicious slogan that marked the beginning of Arthur's reign, "Man's word is God in man" (The Coming of Arthur , 1. 132), has degenerated into the cravenly murmured "word" of rumor: "Lo, thou likewise shalt be King." Although each six-word slogan is uttered on or near a "field of death" (The Coming of Arthur, 1. 131), only the former arises under the holy auspices of God and country. On that first field of death, Arthur is observed crowned with "the fire of God" that "Descends upon thee in the battle-field" (11. 127-128); by contrast, in Lancelot and Elaine Arthur is observed wearing only a carnal crown that had earlier descended "down the shingly scaur." Whereas the first slogan bespeaks the bond of personal and political loyalty between Arthur and Lancelot, King and vassal - the divinely sanctioned "trust" "to the death" upon which the entire Order of Camelot is to be founded (1. 133) - the second slogan augurs only the communal and politi- cal dismemberment of Camelot. Before uttering the first slogan, Arthur thus "stay[s] the brands / That hacked among the flyers" from the opposing army, thereby putting an end to the fratricidal divisiveness that preceded his coming (11. 119-120). By contrast, the loose crown and shingles that precede the latter slogan point to the incipient incohesion of a Camelot peopled by autonomous individuals rather than by a communal whole. Like- wise, not only is the latter slogan the fruit of a chilling double dismember- ment - first of skull from skeleton, then of crown from skull - that augurs the loss of Arthur's Kingly body, but the slogan itself bespeaks a similar fate. By stating that Arthur shall "likewise" "be King," the slogan delphically affirms that Arthur shall ultimately not be King, but only king: like the fratricidal original owner of the crown, who is twice named "king" but never King (11. 39, 45), Arthur's kingship will ultimately degenerate from its ho- listic Christian ideal into fratricidal strife against Lancelot and Modred.</page><page sequence="12">286 / VICTORIAN POETRY Arthur, however, misreads the murmured prophecy, for he is willing to distribute the jewels from the crown to his subjects, apparently un wor- ried that in so doing he will be hastening the demise of his Kingship as foretold by the murmurs. This initial germ of misreading proliferates through- out Lancelot and Elaine, as when Lancelot misreads Guinevere's body lan- guage (11. 83-102), or when Lancelot's "kith and kin" misread the signifi- cance of the blank shield and lady's favor he bears in battle (11. 464-474). These acts of misreading point to what Linda Dowling has identified as a major Victorian anxiety: the problem of autonomous language. Dowling shows that against the reassuring Coleridgean ideal of the lingua communis, which saw language (and especially written poetry) as embodying a na- tional essence beyond individual citizens, Victorian intellectuals were in- creasingly "haunted" by the "autonomous and treacherous counterspirit" of living speech: by the likelihood that language, far from expressing some divinely sanctioned communal essence, merely expresses a blindly evolving linguistic flux that is detached from man's control.19 In Lancelot and Elaine , Tennyson shows that Arthur cannot control "man's word." Just as the mur- murs defeat Arthur's interpretive skills, so too does the crown's dismem- bered central jewel ramify into unforeseen meaning, eventually causing the unintended death of the innocent maid of Astolat. Arthur's original intent that the central jewel be "For public use" has, by the end of the idyll, been transformed into Lancelot's private and pained query, "what profits me my name, . . . what use in it?" (11. 1402-05). One's name or reputation belongs to the ungovernable murmurs of public opinion and rumor, and these au- tonomous forces, by eventually besmirching Arthur's good name, end up subverting Arthur's political power over his subjects. If Tennyson thus poetically reflects the Bagehot-like truth that mon- archy cannot exercise temporal power in a world governed by the res pub- lica of public opinion, does he also find a way to revitalize the noble lie of the King's corpus mysticum, which the many need in order for England to retain its unstable equilibrium? Can the poet succeed where Arthur fails, by having his "word" exert an abiding influence on the culture in which he lives, and especially on those beliefs that go without saying? In the end, Tennyson gives only a tentative answer to these questions. In the brief con- cluding poem to the Idylls, "To the Queen," Tennyson catalogues the sun- dry fears of "some" people about England's future (11. 47-61 ), and then con- cludes with a prophecy that is both dark and conditional: yet - if our slowly-grown And crowned Republic's crowning common-sense, That saved her many times, not fail - their fears Are morning shadows huger than the shapes That cast them, not those gloomier which forego</page><page sequence="13">RICHARD D. MALLEN / 287 The darkness of that battle in the West, Where all of high and holy dies away. (11. 60-66) Against the general bleakness of these lines stands out the phrase "crowned Republic's crowning common-sense," which surely has the most exultant ring in the entire closing poem. Read by itself, this phrase seems to justify the common charge that Tennyson has a penchant for jingoism, as if, merely by repeating "crown" and alliteratively adding a verbal placebo of vague "common-sense," he hopes to induce a misty-eyed, patriotic narcosis in the English reader. Yet read against the fiction of the king's two bodies that pervades the preceding idylls, this phrase expresses a far more complex sen- timent. By flanking the English Republic with crowns, Tennyson both ac- knowledges the fiction of the king's two bodies that has hitherto saved England from a levelling populism in which "all of high and holy dies away," and expresses his hope that this noble lie can ultimately, with the help of the poet, give way to a more egalitarian "common-sense" of which the mon- arch remains the "crowned" - and still charmed - figurehead.

Tucker and Paul Cantor for their helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper. 2 Several critics have recognized the important role that illusion plays in the Idylls. See William R. Brashear, The Living Will: A Study of Tennyson and Nineteenth-Cen- tury Subjectivism (The Hague: Mouton, 1969), p. 126 (Tennyson and Arthur use the "Apollonian illusion of 'Camelot' or civilization" to ward off "Dionysiac chaos" for as long as possible); John D. Rosenberg, The Fall of Camelot: A Study of Tennyson s uldylls of the King} (Cambridge: Belknap Press of Harvard Univ. Press, 1973), p. 10 ("The Idylls of the King is not only explicitly and constantly about the hazards of mistaking illusion for reality; it dramatically enacts those dangers, ensnaring the reader in the same delusions that maim and destroy its characters. Nothing in the poem is as it seems, and nothing seems to be what it is, with the possible exception of Arthur, who may himself be the most dangerous of illusions, the homme fatal of the Idylls"); William E. Buckler, Man and His Myths: Tennyson s ((Idylls of the King" in Critical Context (New York: New York Univ. Press, 1984), p. 16 (Arthur "is located in an illusion of time and space that is indispensable in that it enables him to do his work, defines duty, makes merit meaningful; but it can also be a grand deception, leading one to confuse, at a fundamental level, appearance with reality, reality with appear- ance"). 3 All Tennyson quotations are from The Poems of Tennyson, ed. Christopher Ricks, 3 vols. (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1987). 4 Rosenberg, pp. 127-1 28, 28. As Rosenberg points out, Guinevere refers to Arthur as "the Sun in heaven" (Lancelot and Elaine, 1. 123), and "Arthur is so closely linked to the sun throughout the Idylls that his character never wholly detaches itself from the symbol" (p. 42).</page><page sequence="14">288 / VICTORIAN POETRY 5 See Cammy Thomas, "The Two Arthurs," TRB 6, no. 2 ( 1993): 994 1 1; Richard A.

Press, 1957). 10 Kantorowicz notes that at about the time of Henry VIII the Inns of Court formu- lated a maxim whose orthography reflects the dual nature of kingship: "The king as King never dies" (p. 412). 1 1 The end of the second paragraph of The Coming of Arthur, for instance, describes how "King Arthur . . . Drew all their petty princedoms under him / Their king and head" (11. 16-19). Here, even though Arthur has been specifically identified, his royal epithet - "their king" - is not capitalized. 12 Bagehot also recognizes this distinction between the Queen as flesh-and-blood "Queen," and historicized myth of the Queen as the "head of society" (pp. 90-97). 13 See Kantorowicz, pp. 15, 199 ff., 447. 14 See, e.g., "The Crown as Corporation" in Maitland: Selected Essays, p. 1 10; Pollock, The Genius of the Common Law (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1912), p. 4 (refer- ring to "that useless figment of shreds and patches, a corporation sole"). 15 The Weberian distinction between charisma and bureaucracy, although slightly anachronistic, makes sense here. Bagehot suggests that the state's bureaucracy can domesticate or institutionalize royal and aristocratic charisma (the "theatrical show" of monarchy and nobility) as a way to pacify the masses. 16 The wood demon represents the monstrous "magic" of public opinion: a woodman there Reported of some demon in the woods Was once a man, who driven by evil tongues From all his fellows, lived alone, and came To learn black magic, and to hate his kind With such a hate, that when he died, his soul Became a Fiend, which, as the man in life</page><page sequence="15">RICHARD D.
