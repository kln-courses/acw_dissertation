HINTON I B E HOLD then [wrote Thomas Mun in the last chapter of England's Treasure by Foreign Trade] the true form and worth of foreign trade, which is, the great revenue of the king, the honour of the kingdom, the noble profession of the merchant, the school of our arts, the supply of our wants, the employ- ment of our poor, the improvement of our lands, the nursery of our mariners, the walls of the kingdoms, the means of our treasure, the sinews of our wars, the terror of our enemies. Thomas Mun died in i64I. In that year Lewes Roberts published his Treasure of Traffic. He used the word 'treasure' in a wider sense than Mun. Towards the end, summing up the benefits of commerce, he set out as follows the 'reasons and causes that move all estates, kings and empires to covet the same'.' The first is, the traffic with foreign nations is notable in respect of the honour and reputation thereof. Secondly, excellent in point of riches, both to the king, his country, and subjects. Thirdly, eminent in regard of strength offensive and defensive, that it brings with it to the country and princes where it is orderly managed, and regularly practised by skilful merchants. These considerations explain why English merchants were a cherished race in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They were the premisses of the mercantile system. They may perhaps offer, rightly understood, a useful historical definition of the variable and misleading term, 'mercantilism'. English merchants were said to extend the honour and reputation of I Mun's and Roberts's works were reprinted by J. R. McCulloch in A Select Collection of Early English Tracts on Commerce (i856).

As Lewes Roberts asked, What hath brought the Portugal nation to be famoused in Africa and Asia, or the Spanish name to be notable in America, but her traffic and commerce? It is not our conquests, but our commerce; it is not our swords, but our sails, that first spread the English name in Barbary, and thence came into Turkey, Armenia, Muscovia, Arabia, Persia, India, China, and indeed over and about the world; it is the traffic of their merchants, and the boundless desires of that nation to eternize the English honour and name, that hath induced them to sail, and seek into all the corners of the earth. The geographical expansion of English merchants to which he referred had taken place in the lifetime of Thomas Mun and his father, and was fresh in the memory of the seventeenth century. English merchants in foreign parts supplied the government with foreign intelligence and per- formed diplomatic services. Merchants contributed to the cost of em- bassies. Their trade sometimes created opportunities for embargoes and economic pressure in places where diplomatic power did not reach. They increased the power of the English government as well as its responsibilities. Foreign trade contributed to the king's revenue through customs on imports and exports. In the writings of merchants seeking assistance or putting forward new schemes this aspect was commonly not ignored. To the crown it was indeed important, while on the other hand customs duties that could be passed on to the producer or consumer did no great harm to the merchant. The majority of Englishmen wished to keep internal taxes as low as possible and were glad for the king to draw as great an income as possible from foreign trade. Those who protested against the Stuarts' impositions on trade were taking, apparently, a constitutional view: the lawyers rather than the merchants seem to have taken the lead. In the controversy between free and regulated trade, each side maintained that their opponents' methods tended to reduce the king's revenue. But England was a commonwealth as well as a kingdom and the benefit of the country as a whole was generally thought to be more important than the particular benefit of the king. It was a cliche that the king derived most of his honour from ruling over a great people, and should count himself the richer for ruling over a wealthy one. The manner in which foreign trade was thought to promote the wealth and strength of England can be analysed conveniently under three heads. II Perhaps the most weighty single reason for cherishing merchants was that they gave employment to ships and mariners. The necessity for an island state to be strong at sea was never denied. If in the laissez-faire era naval power could be taken for granted, this was not the case in the period under discussion. Before the time of Oliver Cromwell naval warfare was mainly the business of requisitioned merchant ships; under the Protectorate and</page><page sequence="3">THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM 279 after, though the chief weapon in sea battles came to be the ship built specially for fighting at the order of the navy, merchant ships continued to play a part. At all times the seamen were trained or 'bred' (as the phrase went) in merchant ships. In Thomas Mun's time it is clear that Trinity House, protecting the interests of masters and mariners, had great in- fluence. When navigation was decayed it spoke up without hesitation and demanded protection as of right; by contrast the merchant companies applied for help not so much on their 'own behalf as on the ground that without it they would not be able to employ ships. A bankrupt merchant left the State unmoved, but a ship rotting by the quayside was a matter for concern. Merchant ships should preferably be of a size and stoutness fit for fighting, and a bounty subsidized the building of ships over i00 tons. A ship of 400 tons was a big ship and only relatively distant trades such as the Levant trade employed ships of this order, but merchants of every trade argued as well as they could that their trades supported navigation. The Eastland and Levant Companies boasted that their voyages em- ployed good ships and gave sailors experience of the open sea, and that as the ships made several voyages in a year they were often at home and available for service. The nearer trades, they would say, employed boats and ships of no worth. The East India Company employed exceptionally big and stout ships but had to counter the charge that they were rarely at home.. The coastal coal trade presented itself as a nursery of seamen. Merchant companies claimed that they employed better ships than free traders. Free traders claimed that they employed more ships. It may be worth quoting the free traders in i604: Strength. The increase of shipping, and especially of mariners, in all ports in England. How greatly the mariners of the realm have decayed in all places of latter times, and with how great danger of the state in these late wars, is known to them who have been employed in that kind of service; who do also attribute the cause thereof to this restraint of trade; free traffic being the breeder and maintainer of ships and mariners, as by memorable example in the Low Countries may be seen.' Merchants of foreign nations did not employ English ships save in rare extremity. English merchants often liked to employ foreign ships for their imports. English ships were dear carriers: it was really impossible to combine the virtues of a fighting ship with the virtues of a freighter, and in the carriage of bulky goods of little value the Dutch or Baltic ship had an overwhelming advantage. But it was precisely the cheap bulky goods that employed most tonnage. This created a problem: if foreign trade was to support navigation, the statesman had to make sure, first, that it was in Englishmen's hands and, secondly, that they did not use foreign ships. 1 A. E. Bland, P. A. Brown and R. H. Tawney, 'Instructions touching the bill for free trade', i604; English Economic History: Select Documents (1914), pp. 443 ff. This document seems to contain every free-trade argument used in the seventeenth century. I9-2</page><page sequence="4">280 THE ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW III Foreign trade provided employment and kept poor people from destitution. Thus the merchant who imported dressed flax instead of raw performed an ill service, because he put the community of flax-dressers out of work. They were a relatively small group but, perhaps because they lived near London, they make a considerable showing in the Privy Council registers of this period. But in common parlance the 'poor manufacturer', of whom we hear so much that poverty seems almost to have been regarded as his traditional lot, was the manufacturer of cloth. We do not hear of the 'poor merchant' or the 'poor clothier', but the poor spinner, weaver, dresser and so on was a continual object of concern. Thus for example the free traders, inveighing against the monopoly of merchant companies: And with how great prejudice this is sundry ways to all the land, let example suffice; let the cry of all the clothiers of England testify, and the utter over- throw of infinite poor persons, who live by them and their works. For the clothiers having no utterance of their cloth but to the merchant adventurers, they, by complot among themselves, will buy at what time, what quality, and what price themselves list; whereby the clothiers are fain often to return with loss, to lay their cloths to pawn, to slack their trade, to the utter ruin of their poor workmen, with their wives and children. Of course the merchant companies not only denied the imputation of combination, but would maintain that free trade by exporting less cloth increased the hardship of the cloth workers. There is no doubt that un- employment on occasion was very severe. How many people were directly and solely employed in the cloth industry, and how many drew their livelihood from it indirectly, can hardly be estimated. It probably employed directly several hundred thousand souls-not a large propor- tion of the population, but a concentrated and vociferous one. They seem to have depended largely on the export trade, if contemporary remarks are to be believed. The chief characteristics of their industry were, first, a high technical skill that created specialists, and, secondly, the fact that it was a domestic industry. A specialized worker resists, often beyond the point of real hardship, economic inducements to change his job. A domestic industry is one in which the entrepreneur, the clothier, can stop work at short notice: for the idle looms belong to the weaver. True, he could resume work at equally short notice: but in the meantime there had been poverty. This was a period of rising prices. If wages lagged less than was once thought, at least we cannot suppose that the price revolu- tion left the wage-earner entirely untouched. In Thomas Mun's time it is clear that the cloth worker, particularly in the 'old draperies', had his difficulties, and against this background-hazy as it is-we must see the periodic bouts of unemployment. But in any case long views are not altogether appropriate, because ten years of work do not compensate a man for two years of starvation. The unemployed manufacturer was important as a danger to good order</page><page sequence="5">THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM 281 and internal security. This was the Privy Council's attitude for example in i622, when they wrote to the justices of the clothing counties, at a time of economic depression and unemployment, that they would not endure that the clothiers in that or any other county should at their pleasure, and without giving knowledge thereof unto this Board, dismiss their workfolks, who, being many in number and most of them of the poorer sort, are in such cases likely by their clamours to disturb the quiet and government of those parts wherein they live... this being the rule by which both the woolgrower, the clothier and merchant must be governed, that whosoever had a part of the gain in profitable times since his Majesty's happy reign, must now in the decay of trade ... bear a part of the public losses as may best conduce to the good of the public and the maintenance of the general trade.' The clamours of the poorer sort disturbed the philosopher-statesman, Francis Bacon. He was thinking of them when he wrote the well-known passages of his Essays that not only show him a mercantilist, but are often quoted as among the most concise expressions of mercantilist thought. They do not occur where one might have expected them, in the essay 'Of the true greatness of kingdoms and estates', but in the essays 'Of seditions and troubles' and 'Of empire'. Moreover, in the edition of i6i8 they are not to be found: they make their first appearance in the subsequent edition in i625. The early editions were devoid of remarks with an economic bearing. Their insertion in i625 alters the whole nature of those two essays. They transform 'Of seditions and troubles' from the conventional discussion of the art of managing men into a set of rules for the welfare of a state. If, Bacon says in i625, 'poverty and broken estate in the better sort be joined with a want and necessity in the mean people, the danger is imminent and great: for the rebellions of the belly are the worst.... The first remedy, or prevention, is to remove, by all means possible, that material cause of sedition of which we spake, which is, want and poverty in the estate: to which purpose serveth the opening and well- balancing of trade; the cherishing of manufactures; the banishing of idleness'. In the essay 'Of empire' the new passages transform a simple reflexion on the psychology of princes into a prescription for ensuring subjection, and it is in this rather unlikely connexion that Bacon takes occasion to observe that merchants are vena porta, 'and if they flourish not, a kingdom may have good limbs, but will have empty veins, and nourish little'. We can hardly doubt that Bacon's mind was directed to these thoughts by the wave of unemployment in the great depression that began in i620. Nothing could be more mercantilist. But it is no abstract con- ception of economic wealth that Bacon is concerned with. He writes about good order and the obedience of subjects. In states without police forces and paid civil services these are necessarily the first objects of government. 1 Bland, Browan and Tawney, Select Documents, p. 383.</page><page sequence="6">282 THE ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW IV Finally, foreign trade was the only means of increasing the amount of gold and silver in a country without mines. For this reason Thomas Mun and his contemporaries (and also their ancestors and successors) desired what they called a 'well balanced' trade: they meant a favourable balance of payments. This one of their ideas has attracted most attention and is sometimes taken for the basis of their policy. Such a view is unfounded; they probably thought navigation more important. They did not pursue a favourable balance of trade as an end in itself but as a means to a greater end, which is perhaps best and most simply described as prosperity. We must not be misled by their references to treasure. They did not want more silver (gold was little in question) to hoard it but in order to have more money. Their notion of money was a simple one, and is not easily reproduced in terms proper to the modem science of economics. This has led to accusations that they failed to define money and that they failed to distinguish between money as capital and money as currency. In fact, however, they defined it in a form appropriate to their purpose. It was an anthropomorphic definition, but none the less a formal one. Even in politics, where constitutional differences demanded the utmost possible precision, anthropomorphic definitions about the body politic were the rule. Money, they said, was vital spirits, blood, life, the soul- 'the life of commerce and trade'. This was as if to say by a modern equi- valent that money was energy. According to Bacon in i625 'money is like muck, not good except it be spread'. Money was that which imparted motion. The definition took account of its life-giving purpose as well as its roving nature. It absolutely and deliberately precluded a distinction between capital and currency. Seventeenth-century Englishmen were fond of making distinctions: they could speak when necessary of coin, moneys and ready money as opposed to stock, estates, riches and wealth: but usually they did not distinguish, and it is easy to see why. In the time of Thomas Mun most business enterprises employed by modern standards a low proportion of fixed capital and a high proportion of working capital. Wages and commission payments, transport, and raw materials were evidently much larger items, compared with the value of land and plant, than is usual today. The heaviest industry, mining, was relatively light. The domestic cloth industry was extremely light. Ac- cordingly one is not surprised to discover that people often measured the profitability of a business not so much by the interest it yielded on invested capital as by the number of times they were able to turn their stock in a year. The great thing was to turn the penny. The clothier did not invest, he turned his stock. Money invested in the cloth industry passed fluently to the worker and the producer of raw material, to the spinner, weaver, dresser, dyer, grazier and landowner. In the seventeenth century a man accumulated money in order to invest it and in investing circulated it. It was really, therefore, capital and currency at the same' time.</page><page sequence="7">THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM 283 Only on these lines, it seems, can one explain the difficulty encountered by the best modern authorities at what they regard as a vital point in the mercantilist treatment of money: namely in regard to prices. The late Profes' or Heckscher concluded that the mercantilists wanted or at least tolerated rising prices. Professor Viner on the other hand thought that they did not want rising prices- and that some of them wanted lower prices. Obviously mercantilist writing is confusing on the subject. This has made for difficulty of interpretation, because they were not ignorant (as was once thought) of the principles of the quantity theory of money. They wanted more money: how then could they have escaped expressing a cogent opinion as to its effect on prices? Professor Heckscher concluded that the defect of mercantilist theory was a failure to observe 'the chain of interconnectedness': they did not weld together the fragments of their theory into a coherent whole: had they done this, 'the citadel of mer- cantilist monetary policy would thus have collapsed'. Professor Viner's no less puzzling problem was to reconcile the desire for more money with a belief that it need not raise prices, and to understand how some writers could want more money exactly in order to reduce them.' It is clear from this that prices were not an integral part of their thought. It is equally clear, from their definition of it as the life of commerce and trade, that their reason in wanting more of it was to 'quicken' trade, or in other words to stimulate business. But (as Viner emphatically recognises) the stimulation was not to be achieved through prices. According to the principles of profit inflation, rising prices promote economic activity through keeping profits ahead of costs: this was not the mercantilists' idea. They thought simply that money brought from foreign parts, invested in business and thus circulated as currency, would promote activity irrespec- tive of its effect on prices. If one may translate the idea into modern terms, where MV=PT, more M would produce more T, not higher P. A favourable balance of payments was at one point, however fleetingly, a profit in the pocket of a merchant, most likely of a merchant trading to Spain and a profit from the sale of cloth. In buying the cloth he had paid as little as he could, thus raising prices little if at all. If he spent the profit on gew-gaws and trifles, no doubt there was a tendency for them to become dearer, but if he invested it-the proper course-in an industrial project or in a commercial venture such as the East India or Virginia Company, or in building a ship, it did its useful work before it started to circulate, before it could affect the price level; it was capital before it was currency. It was even possible for the increased production to offset-the increased amount of money in circulation. Whether or not this was a valid theory, it looks a plausible one. Professor Nef's comparative study of 'Prices and Industrial Capitalism in France and England, I540- i640' has shown that profit inflation was less pronounced in the sixteenth and 1 E. F.

Likewise certain recent studies suggest that money for investment was to be found more readily among merchants than among other sections of the population. A more convenient contemporary word than treasure, riches or wealth for summing up the aims of Thomas Mun and his fellows is ' improvement'. This word was generally used of land, but could have been extended without abuse to the whole economic activity of the country. The parti- cular benefits alleged by various writers as occasion offered, as following from a favourable balance of payments, are easily recognizable as signs of general improvement. More money would improve lands and raise gentlemen's rents: it was thought that rents were on the low side. Im- proved lands would better support husbandmen. More money would quicken industry and afford more constant employment to the poor manufacturer. The mercantilists could not approve of dear bread when it was the food of the worker, of dear cloth when this was exported in a competitive market, of dear ships when low freights were desirable. If higher productivity and more frequent turning of stocks allowed here and there a rise in price-if the manufacturer, no longer poor, could afford a dearer loaf-so much the better. But these were secondary results. Hence the diversity of statements about price that puzzled Viner. V The writings from which we infer the so-called mercantilist ideas at present under discussion were largely a product of economic depressions. Most of Thomas Mun's classic exposition was written apropos of the depression of i620, like the famous tracts of Malynes and Misselden. Nearly all the works cited in Professor Viner's bibliography to English Theories of Foreign Trade and most of the English legislation cited in the index to Professor Heckscher's Mercantilism fall in or near the periods of bad trade identified by W. R. Scott.2 The seventeenth-century com- missions of trade, whose instructions embody mercantilist thought and whose inquiries encouraged it, were established in crises. This does not mean that the ideas were short-term, ad hoc and remedial to the exclusion of longer views and general concepts, and Viner rightly observed that mercantilists wanted an indefinite accumulation of the precious metals: it does mean that we must not expect them to have pushed their economic analysis-in other words to have developed an economic science-beyond the point where it was constructive. Mercantilism belongs more to the counting-house and council-chamber than to the study, and cannot be understood, let alone justified or condemned, in ignorance of the mer- I Ecoii. Hist.

In the economic depressions of Thomas Mun's lifetime the common cries were of decay of navigation, decay of trade, decay of clothing, decay of rents, and scarcity of money. The scarcity was a real phenomenon made possible by the high proportion of working to fixed capital. A stop of exports was always an accompanying symptom. When the merchant could not sell cloth profitably, he stopped exporting. The clothier received no orders and stopped making. Clothier and merchant tried to tide over the bad time by living on capital. They called in their loans. Circulation ceased, credit shrank. A great deal of business in normal times was run on credit. In depressions, the tendency to collect debts would slow down a wide area of economic activity. The quantity of silver coin was not necessarily diminished, but it came to be locked up in the houses of those with strongest foundations, that is to say of the men whose operations had been more cautious than optimistic; the Privy Council could not reasonably have ordered clothiers and merchants to continue trading though at a loss, had it not thought they had the money to do so. The situation would be aggravated if at the same time money was exported to pay for imports and if foreign lenders took their money home. Repeated depressions of this nature appear to offer the best explanation for the contemporary emphasis on gold and silver. In the seventy years of Mun's lifetime from I57I to i64I there were only thirty-six years of good trade, according to W. R. Scott; the rest he calls either depressed or bad; he counts seven severe -rises of varying duration. They cannot but have militated against the increase of credit, which otherwise, in an era of confidence, might be taken for granted. We have to remember that the mercantilists were not blind to the theoretical possibility of creating money in other ways than by getting it from abroad. Some of them advocated a paper currency based not on silver (as the normal bill or note might be supposed to be) but on land; that these schemes were not taken seriously seems to be due to obvious lack of confidence in any issuing authority. (Later on, strength and security would breed a bank.) A scheme for brass farthings was actually put into operation; its disastrous recoil onto the head of its manager shows an equally significant failure of confidence, inasmuch as poor people were already accustomed to using tokens issued by shopkeepers. There were also projects to increase money by calling up the coin; making sixpennyworth of silver play the part of a shilling was theoretically an easy means of doubling the amount of money, but could not be entertained in practice: the coinage remained sacrosanct because all transactions depended on: absolute trust in it, and because the silver coins of all nations formed in effect an international currency.. For these reasons Thomas Mun's view prevailed, that the only way to increa e the kingdom's stock of money was to import it as silver in the course of foreign trade. Silver was to be a substitute for confidence. The more money a man had, the more readily he would invest some of it in ventures tending to the national improvement. There was already enough investment to support</page><page sequence="10">286 THE ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW a brisk industrial growth in the century between 1540 and i640, but in which a marked slackening has been observed after the depression of i620.1 One form of improvement was to plant colonies abroad. The Virginia Company had trouble with their subscription list even before i620, partly because the wealthier adventurers, at the sign of a setback in Virginia, transfered their money to Bermuda; with more money it might have been expected that there would be enough for both plantations. When the depression was over, even the East India Company experienced a shortage of investors; it was forced to give higher dividends than the Dutch company and to use terminable stocks when the Dutch company used a running stock; it lacked the necessary capital to make it strong -in the Indies; in its relative failure there was a vicious circle that could perhaps have been broken with more money. Joint-stock companies got capital easily enough in the middle years of Elizabeth I and again at the end of the seventeenth century, but few were founded in the interim and those in existence did not find money plentiful. Had they offered better prospects the money would doubtless have been found, but conversely had there been more money it would have been less necessary to offer good prospects. Something of a substitute for money was to be found in privilege, especially in the extreme form of industrial monopoly, and this is a possible explanation (though others are more usually given) of the flood of applications for patents in the later years of Elizabeth I and under the first two Stuarts. In this connexion it may be noted that a person who wanted to reduce grants of privilege would naturally reveal himself as a mercantilist, because he would be inclined to argue that if projectors commanded more capital they would be better able to stand on their own feet; while a person who was an applicant for privilege would make him- self out a mercantilist by demonstrating that home-made salt, soap, glass, silk, gunpowder, iron, playing-cards, wire, cordage, alum, gold thread, sail-cloth, starch, paper-that Virginian tobacco-that English-caught herrings-that English-finished cloth-would improve the balance of trade. The mercantilists did not believe in Progress, but their contrary idea, Degeneration, was an equally potent spur to action. If they had a positive desire for improvement, this was a natural consequence of the invidious comparison they could not help drawing between their own country and the nation across the narrow sea, in whom the position of England in the nineteenth century was to a large extent anticipated. The Dutch lived on swamps and sandbanks, produced too little corn for their needs, lacked timber for ships and even good harbours for commerce, yet they had established a high standard of life, flourishing manufactures, a dominant foreign trade and a powerful navigation. Strength was measured in relation to the then strongest power, Spain. The Dutch had withstood Spain. Their strength was obviously increasing: and it was economic. Plenty of money, a low interest rate, a quick trade and high productivity I J. U. Nef, Econ. Hist. Rev. VII (I937), i 6 i .

England, on the other hand, endowed by nature with fertile land, corn, wool, mines, sheltered harbours, many people, seemed relatively weak. Comparison was inevitable, more especially as the Dutch were thought to owe their independence to English help and had gone on to increase their strength at the English expense. We arrive here at what seems to be a crucial point in the inter- pretation of Thomas Mun's mercantilism. What commended the policy of improvement and with it the whole body of balance-of-trade theory to the prince and statesman was the fact that they saw prosperity as a means to strength. We can see how pervasive and inescapable these ideas must have been, when they ran so readily in a circle from private profit to national strength and back to private profit: for improvement led to power and power in turn led to further improvement. By contrast, depression produced weakness and weakness produced further depression. It did not occur to the mercantilists that their economic crises were cyclical de- partures from a norm, that they were an inevitable part of the economic process, or that they carried their own cure. The typical-or at least the most severe-depression of Thomas Mun's time, of the period following the Elizabethan expansion, had its beginning in foreign trade, and the chief lesson to be drawn from it was of England's inferiority to the Dutch. This was a matter of imports. If Russian, Baltic, German, French, Spanish, Mediterranean, Indian or American goods were cheaper when brought from Amsterdam than when brought from their place of origin, or if they were obtainable only at Amsterdam, either English merchants went there to get them or Dutch merchants brought them to England. This situation could be brought about by the mere exercise of Dutch power-for example in the Indies and in the fishing grounds-or simply through their better business methods and cheap freight charges. For these reasons the Dutch entrepot was liable to prove an irresistible attraction to the English importer, as in i620 and for some years beforehand: and the same was probably true of Low Country staple towns at earlier times and of Antwerp in particular before her decline in the sixteenth century, at about the Same time as the Elizabethans carried out their expansion. When England became dependent on Amsterdam for imports, the most immediate effect was naturally on shipping: for as English importers from distant places began to feel the competition of the Dutch ehtrepot they would try to cut their costs by using the cheapest ships, that is to say Dutch ships. This blow struck at England's tender point. Her navigation declined, while that of her strongest rival at sea was correspondingly enlarged. The idle ships and mariners were enough in themselves to cause public concern; while pay- ments to foreign shipowners adversely affected the balance of payments. As for exports, mainly cloth, here also the Dutch were competitors. They took white English cloth, dyed and dressed it, and re-exported it to the same places where the English traded. This was one of the factors that limited English sales and profits in the trade on which their whole Euro- pean commerce outside the Netherlands was founded, and on which their</page><page sequence="12">288 THE ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW internal economy was thought largely to depend. Clearly, if the merchant lost his profit on imports in an effort not to be undersold from the Dutch entrepot, he must rely on the profit from exports: but if this made cloth too dear for the distant buyer, trade ceased or was much reduced, Conversely (this happened in i620) it was possible for some independent circumstance in the distant market to remove the profit on cloth: in this case he could only take profit on imports: if competition from the Dutch entrep t made this impossible, again trade ceased or was much reduced. In short, any check to English commerce was likely to be taken advantage of by the Dutch. English ships were laid up and there was unemployment in the clothing counties. The circulation of money was arrested. All the interests that depended on the flow of exports suffered. Perhaps the merchant trading to the Netherlands did not suffer: the Dutch market for white cloth might outlast the distant market for finished cloth, and the English market for Dutch imports, many of which were essential, might remain undiminished. This would affect the balance of payments; if there were Dutch credits in London from previous years' trading they now moved back to Amsterdam. The situation in such depressions may be understood as a reversal of the circumstances under which the Elizabethan expansion had taken place. It threatened to replace the old dependence on Antwerp by a new dependence on Amsterdam. The schemes of the mercantilists tended to raise them above the influence of the Dutch entree t by extending the range of exports, by lessening the demand for imports, and by simply making England too powerful to be pushed out of India and the fishing grounds by force.' VI Few of the regulative acts that compose the mercantile system were directly aimed at a favourable balance of payments. Impositions on imported luxuries play a rather small role. James I and Charles I deliberately attempted to reduce the import of tobacco from Spain, the fountain-head of silver, but the crown's need for money did not permit a wholesale cut in the customs revenue. Import restrictions suited some industrialists but not merchants. The projectors of a new soap manufacture would have dispensed with imported potashes and accordingly claimed this as one of the benefits; they wanted a prohibition of imported potashes for their protection; but the merchants who imported potashes from the Baltic said that without this import trade they could not maintain their export trade of cloth, and that they would employ fewer ships. The soap pro- jectors replied that 'there is a maxim in trade not to be denied, that if our importation exceed our exportation, what pretence soever of employment of shipping and mariners is put upon it, that trade is unprofitable'; 2 1 J. D. Gould, 'The Trade Depression of the Early i620's', Econ. Hist. Rev. 2nd ser. VII (I 954), 8i ff. I agree substantially with Mr Gould's analysis. One awaits with interest the conclusions of Mr B. E. Supple of Christ's College. Much remains to be known about this depression, and especially to what extent it was similar to earlier and later depressions. 2 S.P.

No import restriction that would harm the cloth trade could possibly be countenanced. Tied to this single trade, England was highly sensitive to commercial retaliation by aggrieved foreign states. The mercantilists accordingly put most emphasis on an export drive. Prohibitions against exporting gold and silver were typically mercantilist but equally defensive; they could not bring about its import; they seem not so much designed to stop all export as to stop the Dutch exporting it in payment for imports from their entrepot, and to stop Englishmen exporting it instead of cloth. The main feature of the mercantile system is the trading company. Not only did the company regulate the trade of its members, but the crown regulated the company. It compelled the companies to employ English ships, and the companies were willing to accept this limitation because they could only enforce their discipline by rules affecting ship- masters-rules which foreign shipmasters would not have been bound by. Although the Elizabethan expansion was effected by free traders, sub- sequently the cloth trade required English merchants to have rights of warehouse in foreign ports so that they could continue to export even when they could not sell. Where this right could only be obtained and protected by a company the argument for free trade was weak. Later, in the second part of James I's reign, the companies became in addition instruments of a policy to defeat the Dutch entrepot. It was necessary to ensure that Baltic and Mediterranean goods, for example, were brought from their place of origin and not from Amsterdam. Hitherto the juris- diction of the Eastland and Levant companies had been exercised only over Englishmen trading actually in the Eastland and Levant: now, by proclamations in i6i5 and i622, their jurisdiction was extended over all, English and foreign, importing Eastland and Mediterranean goods wherever found, and they were obliged with the help of the customs officers to prevent imports save from the place of origin. The companies argued for these measures on two grounds: to protect navigation and to protect the cloth trade. These and other measures contrast sharply with the strong and successful free-trade movement at the beginning ofJames I's reign. They plainly originate in the history of the Netherlands, whose twelve-year truce with Spain began in i609. From that date their ships suffered none of the disadvantages of being at war.1 Why was there no Jacobean Navigation Act? English policy was con- ciliatory towards the Dutch, wanted their friendship, permitted com- promise. Englishmen were shocked at their ingratitude and infuriated at some of their actions, but were slow to recognize the possibility of a fundamental cleavage. The state was not ready to provoke them, perhaps because it was too weak to defeat them. Perhaps a Navigation Act seemed to present administrative difficulties to a government that was over-ready 1 A. Friis, Alderman Cockayne's Project and the Cloth Trade (Copenhagen and London, I927), ch. 3, is perhaps the best account of commercial policy in the reign of James I.</page><page sequence="14">290 THE ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW to decentralize. It seemed sufficient to afford particular protection to particular trades; perhaps this was the more efficient method. In any case the Dutch truce ended in I 62I and the danger from their competition receded in proportion as their shipping suffered from freight-raising attacks by privateers, while English shipping enjoyed the advantages of neutrality for a few years. But the commercial prosperity of Charles I's reign after i630 was ill-founded and short-lived. At the end of the Thirty Years War and the almost simultaneous beginning of the English republic, all the advantages were to the Dutch and all the disadvantages to the English. There were loud complaints of crisis: trade was decayed, shipping at a stand; cloth workers were unemployed; imports came from Amsterdam. The Navigation Act' of i65I laid down as general principles for all trade the devices that had been applied by proclamation in the Eastland and Levant trades. In thus protecting commerce it protected everything that depended on commerce, notably (as the title implies) shipping and navigation. Peterhouse, Cambridge 1 For the context of the Navigation Act I follow Philopatris, The Advocate (London, 1651), which is substantiated by petitions from trading companies and (as to Baltic trade) by the Sound toll registers. I hope to take the opportunity of reprinting The Advocate as an appendix to a study of the Eastland trade in the seventeenth century, from which the present view of the mercantile system has arisen.</page></plain_text>
