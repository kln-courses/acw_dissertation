<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Canaanite Ram-Headed Cup* UZA ZEVULUN Haaretz Museum, Tel Aviv THE clay vessel1 discussed in this article belongs to a well-known class of animal headed cups2 which were common in various countries of the Near East during the second and first millennia B.C.E.3 In order to place this particular vessel in its local cultural and artistic context, a number of other animal-headed cups and several animal sculptures from the ancient Near East have been examined. We have also drawn on textual and pictorial evidence to throw light on the nature of the production and use of animal-headed cups in the Levant. The first appearance of animal-headed cups in Palestine will be discussed in a subsequent article;4 here we will deal with a later phase of their local history, to which this ram-headed cup belongs. DESCRIPTION OF THE CUP (Fig. 1:A-D; Pis. 5:A,B; 6:A,B) The vessel was reputedly found at the coastal site of Mikhmoret.5 Its ram's head was fashioned at the cone-like termination of the wheel-made, cylindrical cup. The rim is missing, and hence the original length of the cup is unknown. Its present length is 19.5 cm.; its diameter (at the broken end) 12.5 cm., and its maximum diameter 15.5 cm. It is made of sandy, yellowish-brown clay, with white, grey and red grits. Traces of burnished, reddish-brown slip can be seen. The closely fitting horns, which nearly encircle the face, were modelled from coils of clay; for the tiny ears clay pellets were used. The eyes, central ridge, snout and lower jaw were made by pressing outwards from within the hollow head. The groove in the middle of the lower jaw was made by pressing the moist clay inwards; it enables * This is a modified version of an article published in Israel ?

However, the artist's intention to produce a summary depiction of a ram's head with its curving horns framing the face is clearly evident.

Sculpted Ram's Head from Alalakh* (Fig. 2) (Fifteenth century B.C.E.) Our vessel may be compared to several finds from the Levant in the shape of animal heads. The first object that comes to mind is the monumental stone ram's head from Alalakh (32 cm. high). It was found in Room 29 of the Stratum IV palace. This head displays a remarkable similarity to our example, both in the conception of the animal's physical features and their execution. Comparable points include: a. The close-adhering horns framing the face. b. The vertically set eyes. c. The unusual placing of the tiny ears. d. The slightly turned-out tips of the horns. e. The vertical ridge down the middle of the face. However, the most characteristic stylistic feature common to these two animal heads is the odd, vertically set eyes, which give the face its somewhat surrealistic aspect. To appreciate the points of similarity between these two objects properly, one must bear in mind that the large sculpted head was meant to be viewed frontally, while the cup could be looked at from various angles. The small eyes of the Alalakh head are carved in an extremely flat relief which obscures their fierce, menacing stare, except when viewed under strong illumination from the side. This contrasts with the pottery head, where exaggeration was used to achieve the surrealistic look of the large, protruding eyes. However, closer examination shows that despite their remarkable similarity these two heads also 6 L. WooUey: Alalakh, London, 1955, p. 239, Pl. XLV.</page><page sequence="4">A CANAANITE RAM-HEADED CUP 91 differ in one significant respect. Unlike the naive style of the Mikhmoret cup, the Alalakh head is a piece of mature art in which geometric abstraction is carried to an extreme. The face is rendered in two symmetric planes, which slope away from the central ridge. There is an extreme stylization of features that allows the animal to be identified only by the horns that frame its head. This stylized head from Alalakh clearly points to the existence of a well-established tradition of sculpture in North Syria. The influence of this obviously superior tradition on the naive style of our cup is evident, and tends to confirm its dating to the Late Bronze period. Fig. 3: Bronze animal-headed cup from Qatna. 2. Bronze Ram-Headed Cup from Qatna1 (Fig. 3) (Late fifteenth century B.C.E.) In the 'salle de la pierre noire' at the temple of the goddess NIN.?.GAL of Qatna, a bronze-cast ram-headed cup was found. Two imported Late Mycenaean III Al pottery vessels, found in the same room, suggest a date around 1400 B.C.E. for the cup. This rare bronze example is the only metal animal-headed cup from Late Bronze Syria so far published. Its hornless animal head is rendered in a naturalistic style, thus differing from the Mikhmoret cup. The two cups also differ from one another in their overall shape, most obviously in the relation between the head and neck: the joint is straight in one case and bent in the other. This distinction allows us to define the Qatna cup as a bent-necked animal-headed cup, while the Mikhmoret cup belongs to the straight-necked, horizontally-posed group of animal-headed cups. 7 R. du Mesnil du Buisson: L'ancienne Qatna, Deuxi?me campagne de fouilles (1927), Syria 9 (1928), p. 19, No. 15; Pis. XVI: 1 and XVII: 1.</page><page sequence="5">92 UZA ZEVULUN Earlier examples of bent-necked, animal-headed cups have been found in Anatolia,8 and are also represented on Anatolian stamp seals.9 Depictions of bent necked cups, made of precious materials, are common in Egyptian scenes of foreign tribute bearers.10 Such vessels also appear in the scenes engraved on one of the Megiddo ivories, as well as on an alabaster vessel from Ugarit (see below, Figs. 10-11). The Qatna cup thus suggests that not only gold and silver, but also less costly metals were used in the local production of animal-headed cups. Fig. 4: Ram-headed faience cup from Enkomi. 3. A Group of Faience Animal-Headed Cups (Figs. 4-5, PL 6:C,D) (Thirteenth century B.C.E.) Three ram-headed faience cups, all dated to the thirteenth century B.C.E., have been published so far. Two of these cups were found in the temple at Tell Abu Hawam (PL Fig. 5: Horse-headed cup from Enkomi. * Tuchelt (above, . 3), p. 48, Abb. 1; .

Unlike the schematic depiction of the Mikhmoret head, however, they are all rendered in a detailed naturalistic style. The detailed rendering is exemplified by the precise relief modelling of skin folds and eyebrows (Fig. 4), as well as by the painting-in of additional features with glaze and underglaze colours. Although differing from the Mikhmoret cup in their general style, the faience vessels share with it the close-adhering horns, the straight neck and the horizontal shape of the body. The straight-necked form is also characteristic of the horse and gazelle-headed cups (Fig. 5) from Enkomi.13 The Mikhmoret cup and the five faience animal cups all belong to the straight-necked, horizontal animal-headed type.14 The neck and the animal head are two distinct and equally important elements characteristic of this type. The thirteenth century faience group is especially notable for its female-headed cups, which, unlike the horizontal animal-headed cups, are upright and footed. It should be noted that in each of the assemblages containing ram-headed cups, female headed cups were also found. In one case, in the temple at Tell Abu Hawam, fragments of a small ivory throne as well as a bronze figurine of an enthroned deity were also found.15 This may suggest that zoomorphic and anthropomorphic cups were used together in ritual.16 These faience cups are generally believed to have originated from a single centre,17 probably in North Syria,18 from which they were distributed over a wide area. 4. Two Levanto-Helladic Head Rhyta from Ugarit19 (Fig. 6) (Thirteenth century B.C.E.) In order to illustrate the complexity of the subject of animal-headed vessels, we are including two examples of ram-headed rhyta of Levanto-Helladic ware, common in the Levant during the thirteenth century. Levanto-Helladic animal-headed rhyta, decorated in Mycenaean style, were common at Ugarit and Enkomi,20 and have also 11 R.W.

There is less modelling on the rhyta, and only projecting features, such as the horns and eyes, were applied to the vessel. The painted decoration not only covers the entire vessel with typical Mycenaean designs but also fills in missing facial features, such as the mouth and nose. The decorative patterns over the facial features produce a rather weird effect on these vessels. 5. Lion-Headed Clay Cups from Ugarit (Figs. 7-9) (Fifteenth-thirteenth centuries B.C.E.)

As we shall try to show there is a consistent stylistic development within this group, which suggests that these three locally made cups can be placed in a continuous chronological sequence, probably ranging from the fifteenth to the thirteenth centuries B.C.E. (a) Lion-Headed Cup23 (Fig. 7) Provenance and archaeological context unpublished. Length 16.2 cm. The cup is made of local, unslipped clay. There are traces of knife-shaving at the join between the animal head and the cylindrical neck and especially in the cleft beneath the snout, the hollow eye-sockets and the gaping jaws. Like an early unpublished Anatolian example from Karah?y?k, this Ugaritic cup has a single handle.24 This ferocious lion with its gaping jaws is in keeping with Near Eastern artistic tradition; certain of its details recall the roaring lions on the Middle Bronze basalt basin from Ebla25 whose lips and ears are outlined and accented by continuous incisions. They are also reminiscent of the lion heads decorating the Late Bronze damascened axe from Ugarit, though here inlaid gold threads fill the incisions.26 23 . Kohlmeyer and E.

It is made of buff burnished clay, decorated with an incised halter and a 'signe royal'; it has a single handle. A later and simpler example of a straight-necked, horizontal bull-headed cup dating from about 1200 B.C.E. with a single handle was recently unearthed at Bogazk?y; see P.

The line descending from the angle of the eye is similar to the line found on the sculpted lions in the Beth-Shean basalt relief. The supralabial vibrissae are indicated by slanting incisions over the moulded sides and front of the upper snout. This way of stylizing the vibrissae is characteristic of Near Eastern lion heads, but absent on the Aegean lion-headed rhyta.27 The other two lion-headed cups from Ugarit (see [b] and [c] below) show a decided tendency towards flattening and schematization of the snout. On lion head (b), the plastic modelling of the snout is missing and the vibrissae on both sides of the nose are indicated by slanting incisions only, while on lion head (c) the front of the snout and the vibrissae are a mere schematized pattern of vertical incisions. (b) Lion-Headed Cup (Fig. 8) This vessel was found in a grave underneath a private house, in the north-eastern part of the upper city of Ugarit. No dimensions or description are given in the publication. As far as can be judged from the photograph, the cup is made of local clay, unslipped and unburnished. The face of the lion (or lioness?) is preserved intact; the back part was broken off and is missing. The head is fashioned in accordance with the North Syrian sculptural tradition, with jaws agape, fangs bared and tongue thrust out. The head is correctly proportioned and very vital in character. The facial planes are separated and outlined by incised lines, the enclosed areas filled with short incised strokes. The protuberant eyes were pressed outward from within the hollow head and outlined by incisions, as on the Mikhmoret cup. (c) Lion-Headed Cup with Dedicatory Inscription29 (Fig. 9) The votive cup, whose rim was damaged in antiquity, was found in a large private house, carefully deposited in a small cell built inside a room. Unlike cups (a) and (b), this lion-headed example bears an Ugaritic dedicatory inscription, impressed before firing on its right side behind the face. The cup is made of local clay, lightly burnished. It measures 18.5 cm. in length; maximum diameter ? 15.5 cm.; diameter at rim ? 10.0 cm.. It has a single handle. The two-line inscription reads: 1: bn agptr 2: pnarw ds'ly nrn IrSpgn 27 See in this connection three Aegean lion-headed rhyta: 1) a gold rhyton from Mycenae; 2) a white, marmoreal limestone rhyton from Knossos, in S.

Son of Agap-?arri Lion face that Naran has offered to Resheph-gan The importance of this rare find lies in the fact that it is the first, and so far the only, Near Eastern animal-headed cup bearing a dedicatory inscription. In the present context, the unique correlation between a previously unknown Ugaritic term and this distinct class of objects should be emphasized. It is, it seems, in the nature of dedicatory inscriptions to specify the votive objects by naming them. In this particular case, the words pn arw, 'lion face', indicate the very vessel on which they are written.30 This is apparent not only from the distinct type and shape of the votive cup itself, but also from the use of S'ly (a shafel of the verbal root 'ly, meaning 'to raise, to offer1) on which these words depend.31 In his comprehensive study of lion-headed cups and situlae, D?lier rightly emphasized the importance of this cup within a continuous ancient Near Eastern tradition ? a phenomenon not discussed by Yadin in his own study of this votive object.32 D?lier clearly demonstrated that in their use of the term 'head', when listing lion-headed vessels, the Neo-Assyrian scribes were actually continuing a long established second millennium scribal tradition, dating back to Mari of the Old Babylonian period. In the light of this evidence, it may at first appear strange that a trained Ugaritic scribe used the term 'face' to designate this vessel which is in fact 30 For a later example of a drinking vessel with self-identifying votive inscription, see N. Avigad and J.C. Greenfield: A Bronze phial? with a Phoenician Dedicatory Inscription, IEJ 30 (1982), pp. 118-128. 31 S'ly is attested so far only on two inscribed stelae; see R.

However, another formula of a similar nature is attested in the Ugaritic texts. Lipmski suggested that the Ugaritic ap w nps ksp w hr$, 'snout and neck of silver and gold', denotes a second type of zoomorphic vessel shaped in the form of a recumbent animal protome.33 The examples mentioned by Lipmski are two Hittite silver cups in the Schimmel Collection, one shaped like a recumbent stag protome and the other like a recumbent bull-protome. It is interesting to note, in this context, that the term 'face' is already attested in the Annals of Thutmosis III in connection with an Asiatic ram-headed vessel.34 The recording of a 'ram-face' vessel among gifts brought back by Thutmosis III from his eighth Syrian campaign probably implies that the Egyptian scribe was familiar with this type of foreign vessel and also with the foreign term for it, which he translated into Egyptian as 'face' in this case and as 'head' when listing the Syrian tribute of Thutmosis' thirteenth and fourteenth campaigns. We now have a genuine Ugaritic example of an animal-headed cup with the same term inscribed on it by an Ugaritic scribe. This unique votive object may suggest an Ugaritic practice of designating vessels of this class by a combination of the term pn, 'face' with a specific animal's name. Such a practice would be in keeping not only with the above-mentioned Egyptian example but also with the established scribal tradition discussed by D?lier.35 Only if new relevant documents come to light will it be possible to verify our interpretation of the term 'face' + animal's name as the Ugaritic designation for animal-headed cups. The lion's head with its schematically rendered gaping jaws, bared fangs and out-thrust tongue is in keeping with the North Syrian sculptural tradition. However, in comparison with cups (a) and (b) the modelling is poorly done and the facial proportions are ludicrously awry. It shares with the Mikhmoret cup and the other two Ugarit examples an identical technique of manufacture. There is a close resemblance between the exaggeratedly large eyes of this lion and the eyes of the Mikhmoret ram. However, the framing of facial planes met on the earlier Ugarit examples is here reduced to two incised circles around the eyes. This inscribed cup 33 E.

This magnificent drinking vessel (Sa Sat?) was a royal gift to Hatushili III; cf. E.

The stylistic and technical relationship of the Mikhmoret cup to the lion-headed vessels from Ugarit has been demonstrated above. It thus emerges that these Late Bronze Age clay cups can be classified with the group of straight-necked, horizontal animal-headed cups, so far attested only by the faience group. They may be regarded as typological forerunners of the Assyrian and Achaemenid animal-headed cups.36 It has also been demonstrated that these locally made clay vessels are modelled in the Near Eastern sculptural tradition, with no trace of Aegean influence. Along with the bronze and faience examples, they form a distinctive group of Near Eastern animal-headed cups. The variety of animal- and female-headed cups within this group shows that the production of Syro-Canaanite workshops was not limited to one material nor to one type of head vessel. It now seems clear that Syro-Canaanite animal-headed cups took even more varied forms than suggested by Egyptian sources such as the tribute lists inscribed on the temple walls at Karnak and the scenes depicted in Theban tombs. Although it is not possible to distinguish between cups and rhyta in the Egyptian tomb scenes, it may be fairly assumed that the vessels brought by the keftiu are rhyta of Aegean origin, while the Syrian and Canaanite bearers carry locally made animal headed cups.37 However, the two lion-headed silver vessels depicted in the tomb of Amenmose as part of the tribute from Retenu may now be identified as horizontal, straight-necked cups of the Canaanite type.38 The importance of this pictorial evidence was already discussed by Kantor in the 1940s, but only with the discovery of the Canaanite lion-headed cups from Ugarit and of the Mikhmoret ram-headed cup can it be confirmed that the Egyptian artist was not mistaken in depicting such lion-headed cups among the objects of Canaanite tribute.39 THE FUNCTION OF THE ANIMAL-HEADED CUPS An important though complex question is the function of these cups, which were basically designed as drinking vessels. This can only be briefly touched upon here. 36 Tuchelt (above, . 3), p. 57. 37 In the Annals of Tuthmosis III 'head of goat, head of lion' as well as 'head of bull' are listed among the precious vessels brought as booty from Syria. They are labelled specifically as 'vessels of all the work of Zahi' and as 'products of this country...' (Retenu); see Breasted (above, n. 34), p. 210 (509); p. 211 (518); cf. Helck's translations, in Helck (above, n. 34), p. 403 (Urk. IV, 718,2; 722,3). 38 N.

Fig. 11: Ceremonial scene on an ivory plaque from Megiddo. The fact that animal-headed cups were found in temple and tomb contexts would seem to indicate a ritual function. This is also borne out by the dedicatory inscription to the Canaanite god Resheph on the Ugarit cup. Another use of animal-headed cups suggested by official documents is as royal gifts in diplomatic exchanges between kings.40 That these cups were also used on important occasions at the Canaanite royal courts may be gathered from two works of art from Ugarit and Megiddo, which depict similar ceremonial scenes. The Ugarit scene (Fig. 10) appears on a broken alabaster vessel, the fragments of which were stored in the central palace archive.41 It shows king Niqmad of Ugarit facing a lady dressed as an Egyptian princess, who is offering him a drink; in the centre of the scene a bull-headed cup is depicted on a table, placed between the royal figures.

Compared to the other vessels in these scenes, such as the drinking bowls and the pouring situla, which had a practical function, the animal-headed cups apparently served only for ceremonial display. The discovery of Canaanite clay animal-headed cups in Ugarit and Mikhmoret reopens the problem of the similar cups from Philistine contexts. Do these latter constitute a direct and natural continuation of a well-established Canaanite tradition? Only six Early Iron Age human- and animal-headed cups have been published and discussed to date: 1. A female-headed cup from Gezer, which probably stood on a trumpet foot.43 The foot was joined to the cup by means of the conical projection at its bottom (Fig. 12). Similar conical projections also occur on footed chalices. 2-6. Five lion-headed cups from Tell Qasile, Tel Zeror, Megiddo, Tell es-Safi and Tel Gerisa (Jerishe).44 All these are horizontal, straight-necked cups which, like the Late Bronze Age examples, are composed of two elements: the animal head and the straight-necked cup part. The formal and thematic division of these cups into zoomorphic and anthropo morphic types is attested as early as the Middle Bronze Age.45 Fig. 12: Female-headed cup from Gezer.

The earlier example is the well-known Middle Bronze Age cup from Jericho46 and the later is the Early Iron Age cup from Gezer (Fig. 12). As on the lion-headed cups from Ugarit, these Early Iron Age lion-headed cups are provided with a single handle, extending from the rim to the middle of the body. Fig. 13: Lion-headed cup from Tell es-Safi. The skilful naturalistic modelling of the lion heads from Tell es-Safi (Fig. 13) and Tel Zeror (Fig. 14) (Dothan's Group A)47 continues the superior modelling tradition embodied in lion-headed cup (b) from Ugarit (Fig. 8). One may compare, for instance, the identical indentations of the nostrils or the way lines of paint (instead of incisions) are used to indicate certain facial traits. The schematically naive modelling of the lion heads from Tell Qasile (Fig. 15) and Tel Gerisa (Dothan's Group B)48 forms a direct continuation of the abbreviated and schematic modelling of the inscribed cup from Ugarit (see Fig. 9 above). Like the latter, these lion faces are rendered in keeping with the Near Eastern sculptural tradition, emphasizing the animal's ferocious aspect (gaping jaws, bared fangs and thrust-out tongue). However, there are also differentiating features. Thus, the Iron Age lion faces were modelled with prominent brows and tiny round ears. The large-scale use of incisions typical of the Late Canaanite ram and lion faces was here replaced by painted lines. 46 J.

Black and red-painted lines and stippling on white slip were used to demarcate and set off facial planes and details, such as the swell of the jowls.49 The frieze on the neck of the Tell Qasile cup attests that not only the faces but also the necks of the lion-headed cups were decorated with painted designs. The double spiral design of the central metope is typical of the Philistine ceramic style, while the stylized palm tree on the cup's handle is clearly a Canaanite motif. The fact that the Tell Qasile lion-headed cup was found in a favissa of the temple, along with a complete anthropomorphic vessel representing a woman, may perhaps indicate a common ritual function.50 Evidence that the two types of cups ? anthropomorphic and zoomorphic ? were indeed used together in ritual was found in the Late Canaanite temple at Tell Abu Hawam. Thus from both functional and 49 Mazar (above, . 16), p. 101. 50 For a description of the finds from the favissa, see Mazar (above, n. 16), p. 25.</page><page sequence="17">104 UZA ZEVULUN Fig. 15: Lion-headed cup from Tell Qasile. formal viewpoints we would describe the so-called 'Philistine rhyta' as Canaanite animal-headed cups, independent of any Aegean influence. In this interpretation we differ from the conclusions of Dothan, Mazar and Yadin.51 To sum up, it has been shown that during the Late Bronze Age, Syro-Canaanite workshops in Palestine as well as in Syria produced a great variety of animal-headed cups, which attest a long-established Near Eastern tradition going back to Mari of the Old Babylonian period and the Assyrian trading colonies in Anatolia. These locally made cups, which continued into the Iron Age, form an important addition to the corpus of Canaanite art and cult objects.52 51 See Dothan (above, n. 43), Mazar (above, n. 16), and Yadin (above, n. 32), pp. 260-263. 52 Since this article was originally written, some more animal-headed cups have been published: an Iron Age I clay lioness-headed cup has been found at Tel Miqne (Phase 9D), see Trude Dothan and S.
