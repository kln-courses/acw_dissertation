<plain_text><page sequence="1">Style and meaning: Abelam art through Yolngu eyes The 1998 Anthony Forge Lecture HOWARD MORPHY concept of style, as the result of a process for producing meaningful forms, that I focus on here and apply to two geographically distinct artistic systems, that of the Abelam of the Sepik River Province of Papua New Guinea, which was studied by Forge and that of the Yolngu of Eastern Arnhem Land in Northern Australia, which was the subject of my own research. The choice is not an entirely arbitrary one. On the surface at least there appear to be some similarities of form between Abelam flat painting and Yolngu bark painting. Indeed, Forge himself thought that there were similarities in the underlying structure of the systems. While formal similarities do not necessarily mean that the systems that produce them have anything in common, they provide a focal point for comparative analysis. Moreover, an additional motivation for the comparison was the visit of two Yolngu artists, Narritjin and Banapana Maymuru, to the Australian National University and their willingness to take part in a discussion with Anthony Forge and me over Abelam art.3 To understand Forge's analysis of Abelam art and recognize its originality, it is necessary to see it in the context of its times. It was influenced both by the problematics of Western art history and by recent analyses of non-European art, including Australian Aboriginal art.4 These provided comparative perspectives on the Abelam and influenced the terms in which Forge was to present his analysis of their art. He was concerned in both cases with the differences of Abelam art as well as the similarities. As an anthropologist, Forge approached Abelam art with a number of questions in mind: what the art represented, what its meaning might It is significant that the concepts of style and meaning figured prominently in Anthony Forge's anthropology of art.1 In the 1960s, style was a concept strongly associated with art history. Although it had its brief life in the grand theoretical schemes of Kroeberian anthropology in the United States it had hardly entered British anthropological discourse.2 But style was a key term in the study of non-European art, linking it to the fields of art history, archaeology, cultural history, and equally to connoisseurship. Style enabled the anthropology of art to engage with art history. Meaning, on the other hand, was what allowed art to be seen as relevant to anthropology itself at a time when the structural functionalist paradigm as a whole was under challenge from many different directions. By focussing on style and meaning Forge brought together the concerns of the two disciplines?anthropology and art history?and pointed the way to a more challenging and interdisciplinary anthropology of art. Although style and meaning are key concepts in Forge's anthropology of art, nowhere are they rigorously defined. Forge uses style in two different senses, both of which are familiar uses in art history, without clearly differentiating between them. Style is used for the formal description and categorization of objects, which enables them to be allocated a place in space and time, and style is used in the more metaphysical sense of reflecting a coherent element in the production of objects. In the second sense, Forge is concerned with the reason behind the particularities of form: with the idea that style is the product of a specific way of conveying meaning, expressing ideas, or marking status. It is this 1. A version of this paper was given as the inaugural Anthony Forge Memorial Lecture at the Australian National University in 1998. It has been a long time in gestation and already the next two lectures have been published (L?sche 2001 and Tuzin 2002). Many people have helped me in preparing this paper for publication, in particular Karen Westmacott, Frances Morphy, and Don Tuzin who facilitated access to the Forge archives.

Forge's most detailed statement of his position is his introduction to the volume he edited on Primitive Art and Society (Forge 1973a).</page><page sequence="2">210 RES 47 SPRING 2005 be, and how the Abelam interpreted it. In comparison with Arnhem Land art, as analyzed by Charles Mountford (1956), Abelam art seemed to lack external referents (Forge 1966:23). In Eastern Arnhem Land and Australia in general, art appeared to be closely integrated within the Dreamtime and the myths of world creation. Art could be interpreted, at least in part, as the representation or illustration of myth. For every painting there appeared to be a "story" that was part of its meaning. Among the Abelam, Forge had found few myths, and the meaning of the art appeared at first to be elusive. The Abelam had names for individual elements of a painting and often had a gloss in English?"flying fox," "eye," "breast," or "leg of pork"?but this did not seem to get him very far. The meanings were not organized syntactically to illustrate myths or stories but seemed almost arbitrary. Moreover the same element could have a variety of meanings, which again did not appear to vary systematically with context. The same element could represent a leg of pork, immature fern fronds, black palm cockatoo, and swirls in a river. In some cases he notes that the artist refused to say in advance what he was painting, and sometimes changed his mind half way through; and if there were two people collaborating they might disagree. From Western art theory Forge drew on the distinction between abstract and representational forms. Forge defined as "abstract" cases where there was no clear relationship between form and meaning. Representational paintings were ones in which the parts were organized to represent a more encompassing whole, which at one level might be a face, or a person, and at another level might be a mythic episode. Representational art covered similar ground as terms such as figurative or iconic. He was able to apply the distinction to contrasting Abelam ?mages, some of which were more representational than others. He drew a contrast between two paintings of the same ancestral figure: "[Figure 1] is clearly anthropomorphic albeit highly stylized. The other [fig. 2] is a pattern and little else to non-Abelam eyes. Yet both are called ndu, both comprise the same elements and both are equally effective in ritual terms" (Forge 1973b:183). Forge notes that the important thing is not what the paintings represent but that they are comprised of the same set of elements. To Forge the fact that they share an identity despite apparently being structured on different organizational principles challenged the opposition that was often drawn between representational and abstract art. The point he is making, that in Abelam art "there is no line to be drawn between representational and abstract" (Ibid.), is a fundamentally important one. However, Forge somewhat overstates the case because the distinction between more representational and less representational forms is central to his argument. Forge's analysis at times lacks clarity because he uses a very generalized concept of meaning. As a consequence, he fails to do justice to the brilliance of his ideas about the meaning-creation process in Abelam art, in which the meanings of the individual elements play a significant part in producing meaning in the system as a whole. The paintings use a restricted range of elements that can be combined in many different ways. Forge implies that there is a basic set of designs that make up the repertoire of a particular community, but elsewhere suggests that the designs themselves are subject to individual variation. The design elements often have names and meanings associated with them, but since Forge does not list many of the names or provide an inventory of meanings, it is impossible to analyze them in detail.5 However, from the examples he gives, it is possible to say that the relationship between form and meaning is patterned by iconicity at least as much as is the case with Central Australian graphic signs.6 In Abelam art, circles have ranges of meanings?from eyes to stars?that are consistent with a circular form. Even in the case of more specific designs, such as the leg of pork, other meanings associated with the same design such as fern fronds and swirls in the rivers course seem motivated by formal considerations. That does not of course suggest that every meaning is attached on the basis of iconicity, in particular abstract meanings such as male power or ancestors. Even in such cases, however, iconicity may be one factor in complex metaphorical and semantic processes. Eyes are represented by circles and have close associations with stars (kwun) and by way of fireflies (also kwun) with ancestors (Forge 1973b:190). The paintings as a whole are associated with certain spiritual entities and express Abelam ideas and values. In many cases they represent nggwalndu, clan ancestral spirits. These are present in the cult houses in the form of figurative wooden carvings and are the most powerful spirit known to exist. Some nggwalndu can combine human and non-human features and some paintings represent animal forms but Forge does not elaborate on the cosmology of the Abelam. Each painting of a 5. Diane L?sche (2001:160 ff) emphasizes the importance of names associated with design elements in Abelam paintings. 6. The classic work on iconicity in Central Australian sign systems is Nancy Munn's 1973 book Walbiri Iconography (see also Morphy 1980).</page><page sequence="3">Morphy: Style and meaning 211 Figure 1. Ndu "man" by Nyagere, photo by Anthony Forge, from the Anthony Forge Papers, Mandeville Special Collections Library, University of California, San Diego. nggwalndu has a series of elements associated with it. At one point Forge draws an analogy between the elements of a nggwalndu and the letters of a word: "they form a code built out of a finite number of stylistic elements: various arrangements of those elements signify nggwalndu, butterfly or flying fox" (Forge 1970:282). He then qualifies this by continuing, "the flat painting code has an essential ambiguity in that varying interpretations of elements are possible and equally legitimate" (lbid.:282). However, here he is in danger of opening up the interpretabiiity of the system too much. There is no question that Abelam representations are ambiguous at all levels of the system, and that Abelam designs are highly productive semantically. It is quite wrong to look for a single representational meaning for each design and every design element. Nonetheless the range of meanings associated with particular design elements is limited and the range of meanings is often unique to that element. Certain design forms such as that for flying fox have a referential meaning at their core, even though it contributes only partially to the overall meaning of the design. In such cases it is unlikely that the flying fox design will be used if the design as a whole has no reference to flying foxes. The meaning of Abelam designs is both the product of the system of design generation, of the meanings it is possible to encode within it, and the product of interpretative processes that extend far beyond the design system itself. Forge attempted to deal with the properties of the design system by labelling it as a</page><page sequence="4">212 RES 47 SPRING 2005 Figure 2. Ndu "man" by Tsiretsitban, photo by Anthony Forge, from the Anthony Forge Papers, Mandeville Special Collections Library, University of California, San Diego. closed system, emphasizing its independence from any external system of referential meanings. However, this merely creates a logical problem of where the meanings associated with the closed system come from and how the meanings conveyed by this closed system articulate with those associated with language or ritual. Abelam flat painting as a system has properties that, he argued, are independent of verbal language or ritual action and cannot be reduced to those other systems. Nonetheless one might argue that its semantics could only be understood in the context of more general social and cultural processes. Anthropologists seem to have had tremendous difficulty with the fact that meaning is relatively independent of form but that form is necessary to convey meaning. Once this relationship is grasped then all systems of encoding meanings can be seen to be both relatively restricted and relatively open-ended, depending on the nature of the system and the way it is used. Abelam flat painting is more ambiguous than verbal language used in a certain way and some Abelam images are more ambiguous than others. So far I have been focussing primarily on the elements out of which Abelam paintings are composed. As Forge noted, the elements can be combined together to produce representations that are on the surface figurative or abstract. Abelam flat painting involves a number of complementary principles of selection and organization of elements. A picture of an ancestral figure has to contain a certain set of elements associated with that figure. Once those elements are selected then they can be organized into a whole in a number of different ways. In some cases the picture as a whole represents an ?mage of the animal or ancestor concerned, in other cases it is impossible to discern any such relationship. Forge calls paintings of the first type representational and of the second type abstract (Forge 1973b:174). However, quite rightly he does not wish to imply that these are discrete alternatives, that the painting is either one or the other.7 The ordering of elements in the case of those that appear abstract is clearly related to the way elements are ordered in other paintings, including the representational ones, and vice-versa. Likewise the meaning of the paintings is not determined by the representational order since the other relationships between the elements may also be significant. In contemporary jargon there is no one way of reading an Abelam painting. Abelam paintings are frequently organized to represent a human face or human body, usually the face and body of a nggwalndu ancestor. In representing a face appropriate elements will be chosen to represent the eyes, nose, mouth, body, and limbs. A characteristic W- or M-shaped design is used to represent the arms and legs, and the body itself is frequently represented by a pointed oval. The designs for limbs produce triangular shapes, which express meaning independent of the M-shaped outline itself, and can indeed be part of other figures within the painting as a whole. The interplay between different bases of ordering the elements gives a 7. "[0]ur dichotomy abstract versus figurative or representational is misleading at the very least in Abelam terms and I now wish to analyse a set of paintings from one village which includes both types in one corpus. My aim is to show how Abelam artists handle the elements of their flat painting style and manipulate the different bits and their relationships to create association and relationships between disparate valued aspects of their culture" (Forge 1973b:179).</page><page sequence="5">Morphy: Style and meaning 21 3 great deal of freedom to the Abelam artist, and artists create multiple representations of the human body by exploiting the ambiguity inherent in the representational system. My account so far suggests that Abelam paintings consist of elements that can be combined on a number of different bases. The elements have a set of meanings that are intrinsic to them but which can also be defined, specified, or extended in context. In combination with certain other elements they are part of nggwalndu, or a butterfly, or a flying fox; in the context of certain representations they are an eye, a vulva, a body, or a leg. The meanings are cumulative and more than one can apply in a particular case. Multivalency acts as a channel of connection within a painting and between paintings and contexts of interpretation: "to identify a representation, is not to find out what the painting means, it is merely one element in a complex web of meaning which is to be found in the relationships of the parts that compose them" (lbid.:187). This much is clear from Forge's analysis of the system, which at all points is supported by some limited exegesis from the Abelam.8 The next stage of Forge's analysis involved following these pathways of connection, and it is here that he seems to find meaning for the first time in Abelam art. It is this level of meaning that excites Forge and it is the hardest level to confirm from exegesis. Meaning, in this case, refers to what might be termed the symbolic meaning of Abelam art in opposition to its referential meaning. Forge gives relatively few examples of what these symbolic meanings might be, but one theme that he considers important is the nature of the relationships between men and women, in particular with reference to spiritual power and fertility. He argues that art uses images of sexuality and female creativity to produce images of ancestral power, and provides a context for expressing the ambivalent nature of the relationship between men and women. He gives as an example the relationship between two sets of designs on a house fa?ade (Ibid.:187-189). The top line consists of a frieze of women. The representations clearly indicating breasts and vulva make an emphatic statement of the femaleness of the pointed oval (fig. 3). Underneath is a frieze of nggwalndu heads. Initially there is no reason to suppose that these heads are constructed on the same basis, but Figure 3. Female figure from a fa?ade in Yanuko Village, north Abelam (Forge 1973b:188). on further inspection Forge realizes that the overall head design is contained within a pointed oval (fig. 4). The nggwalndu heads express the primacy of female creativity. Forge then links this association between female figures and nggwalndu heads to a tradition in which women are said to have discovered the original nggwalndu ancestors and became their lovers. When jealous men discovered this the nggwalndu turned into wooden form. We can see why Forge regrets the relative absence of myth among the Abelam since in this case myth appears to confirm his insights. Indeed, this has been a recurrent problem in the anthropological analysis of symbolism in societies which have limited traditions of exegesis and in which there are no parallel systems of song or oral tradition that add conviction to the interpretations derived from the analysis of art and ritual action. Analyses such as Forge's have often been criticized precisely because there is no verbal confirmation of the conclusions drawn.9 This was 8. The issue of exegesis is a highly complex one in New Guinea art since it depends partly on what the analyst's focus is and partly on the degree of verbalization about paintings (see O'Hanlon 1992 for a relevant discussion). 9. While Forge's analysis of Abelam art has been very influential, it has also come under considerable criticism. He has been criticized for neglecting the affective dimension of Abelam art (Roscoe 1995), being insufficiently concerned with what art does (L?sche 1997), and giving too much emphasis to the question of meaning (Roscoe 1995; L?sche 1997). While such criticisms do draw attention to important dimensions of Abelam art that needed to be further explored, they do not in themselves contradict Forge's own analysis. As O'Hanlon (1995:832) points out with reference to this critique, it is important "to</page><page sequence="6">214 RES 47 SPRING 2005 Figure 4. Bottom of ceremonial house fa?ade, nggwalndu faces. Bugiaura ceremonial ground, Yanuko village, photo by Anthony Forge, from the Anthony Forge Papers, Mandeville Special Collections Library, University of California, San Diego. another reason why Forge emphasized the closed nature of Abelam art, arguing that the ideas may not have been expressible in other ways. "Such themes are not talked about openly by the Abelam, they may even be denied . . . (the forms) communicate directly to the Abelam not as an illustration of some spoken text" (Ibid.:190). There are striking similarities between the art of the Abelam and that of the Yolngu of eastern Arnhem Land. Both use the same range of colors, and employ a similar technique of cross-hatching. While the distribution of colors and infill varies overall, it is possible to find paintings in the two cases that look remarkably similar. Some Yolngu art also consists of a limited number of geometric elements that can be combined together in an almost infinite number of ways. I do not want to provide my own analysis of the relationship between the two systems because I have the opportunity to present a more dialogic analysis. In 1978 Narritjin Maymuru and his son Banapana from the community of Yirrkala in northeast Arnhem Land spent three months in Canberra with their families as visiting artistic fellows. They spent most of their time painting, but they also helped to teach classes on the anthropology of art and, on one occasion, spent the day with Anthony Forge and me going through Forge's collection of Abelam paintings and commenting on them.10 That moment, which lasted for a whole afternoon, was a very special one for both Forge and me. It was a mediated discussion between two anthropologists about the art of societies in which they had worked with the questioning being partly directed by artists from one of them. It is what Diane L?sche perceptively refers to as a hybrid moment; it is in such "particular moments of question and answer, which sometimes occur randomly, that differences and recognise the multidimensionality of art" where the semantic, aesthetic, affective, and purposive dimensions all apply to the same object or event. 10 . Narritjin and Banapana's visit is recorded in Ian Dunlop's film Narritjin in Canberra, which includes a sequence of Narritjin co teaching students in Forge's anthropology of art class.</page><page sequence="7">Morphy: Style and meaning 21 5 difficulties of comprehension become clearest and most tangible often signalled by responses of puzzlement, irritation and unease. It is at these points that one faces knowledge of difficult, perhaps intractable, questions that won't go away. These same moments also point towards a path of further research which may lead to some important understanding only barely glimpsed amidst the feelings at the moment of encounter" (L?sche 1997:37).11 The interpretative process that Narritjin and Banapana engaged in was interesting for a number of reasons. We might have expected them to interpret the art according to the properties of their own artistic system, as if it were Yolngu art, and to interpret only those paintings that were formally similar. I think it is fair to say that this was Forge's expectation. Instead they entered into an ethnographic and analytical process, interrogating Forge about the structure of Abelam society and the ways in which art was incorporated within social process. Towards the end they were beginning to interpret Abelam art as a system very different from their own, along lines that showed remarkable similarities to Forge's analysis. However, their view of Abelam art was not quite as distanced as his and they were able to incorporate Abelam paintings within their own social universe.12 If Forge's analysis of Abelam paintings was influenced by his own historical position and by the questions and categories of his culture, so too was Narritjin's and Banapana's analysis. In both cases the analysts reveal much about their own culture through the act of interpreting that of another people. The very questions that Anthony posed about the relationship between representation and abstraction lay at the heart of modernist discourse. The questions Narritjin and Banapana posed were closely related to the place of art in their own society. Interestingly, both parties found some of the same aspects of Abelam art puzzling. Forge, as we have seen, was puzzled by the fact that Abelam paintings had no myths associated with them, a concern that came up several times in Narritjin's questioning. Narritjin's first comment to Anthony was "did you get a story about this?" About half way through he commented "they have got names but they have got no stories. They have got no myths." And at one point he asked almost incredulously, "Couldn't the artist understand what they are meaning?" This line of questioning thus produced precisely the conclusion that Anthony had made, and affirmed the contrast he drew between Yolngu and Abelam art.13 The next topic that Narritjin took up was the relationship between art and social organization. In Yolngu art there is a very precise relationship between designs and group organization. Yolngu society is divided into two patrimoieties, Dhuwa and Yirritja. The moieties are exogamous and patrilineal so that Dhuwa people marry Yirritja people and vice versa. People's primary attachment is to smaller groups within the moiety, which I call clans. The clans are land-owning groups. They play a role in structuring marriage relationships and they have rights in the sacra associated with their clan lands.14 11. Losche's comment is particularly salient since she was writing about her and Anthony Forge's separate encounters with the Abelam. Indeed, the section heading in her work is The hybrid moment in fieldwork: Anthony Forge's question, and, in a way, this entire paper is about that question. One missing element is the absence of the Abelam from the discussion, though Forge had entertained visiting Abelam with a feast in the same room in which we looked at the paintings (L?sche 2001:156). One can only speculate on what difference their presence would have made. The other missing element is Forge himself. This is the paper we always intended to write together. 12. While I would not suggest any direct historical connection between Yolngu and the cultures of the Sepik River, Yolngu have their own indigenous "ethnographic" tradition and their mythology and oral traditions link them closely to the people of eastern Indonesia and New Guinea. The annual visits of the Macassan fleet made people familiar with the indigenous cultures of eastern Indonesia (Macknight 1976; Mclntosh 1996). Yolngu beliefs about the dead include an island of the dead, "Badu" which is a semi-mythical land associated with the Torres Strait Islands and New Guinea. Contact with outsiders is reflected in Yolngu ritual and art, which includes detailed representations of their way of life and material culture (see Morphy 1998:212 ff), Mountford's book contains many references to art that reflect Macassan contact (e.g. Mountford 1956:292, 409). 13. Forge noted this contrast in his first major article on Abelam art where he wrote "The relation of art to myth is a much discussed question. In Arnhem Land, for example, art, myth and ritual appear to be completely interlocked and interdependent; but it seems unlikely that one is justified in taking myth to be primary and the art to be just an expression of it. It seems rather as if they were all three different ways of expressing aspects of the same thing in words, in action and visually, none of them being complete without the other, and none of them being the entire expression on their own/' He contrasted the Arnhem Land case (where his reference point is Mountford's work on the Yolngu (Mountford 1956)), with the latmul neighbours of the Abelam "where there is nothing like this integration" and the Abelam themselves: "With the Abelam the case is much simpler since there is hardly any mythology at all, and none connected in any way with the most important figures, those of the clan spirits nggwalndu" (Forge 1966). Narritjin, who was one of the artists who painted for Mountford on his 1948 American Australian expedition to Arnhem Land alluded to this contrast when, with no prompting, he said: "We have a story line with meaning that we did for Mr. Mountford." 14.

Equilateral diamond, larger than the Dhajwangu one. Elongated diamond. Separate strings of elongated diamonds ending in AA Northeast Arnhem Land is crisscrossed with the tracks of ancestral beings. In the ancestral past they stopped at particular places on their journeys, created features of the landscape, and left behind the people who were to succeed them. Each area of land is associated with a distinct set of paintings, songs, dances, and objects that represent the clan's sacred inheritance and derive from the actions of the ancestral beings who created the landscape. Designs may mark the relationship between groups along an ancestral track. For example, the fire/wild honey complex of the Yirritja moiety is associated with variations of the diamond design. The Djan'kawu designs of the Dhuwa moiety are associated with different combinations of circle-line motifs. Each clan has its own particular version of the design that unambiguously marks it as the property of a particular group. The system of clan designs as a whole enables a precise mapping of the relationship between land, ancestral beings, and social groups (Morphy 1988). The Yirritja moiety diamond designs are associated with a number of clans linked by the fire/wild honey ancestral complex (fig. 5), and each clan has its own variant of the design. Starting geographically in the west, the Dhalwangu design is associated with fresh water inland (fig. 6). The diamonds are small and equilateral, incorporating within their sequence pointed ovals representing billabongs. Munyuku diamonds are similar but larger and infilled differently (fig. 7). The Madarrpa diamonds are more elongated and often end in a shield shaped figure. They are associated with the coastal region of Yathikpa in the east where the crocodile ancestor was caught in the conflagration and dived into</page><page sequence="9">Morphy: Style and meaning 21 7 Figure 6.

North along the coast at Caledon Bay the Gumatj design is associated with a second crocodile who carried the fire inland. This sociological level of interpretation is only one component of the meaning of the design. In each case the design has other meanings that relate to the actions of the ancestral beings, and therefore has enormous interpretative potential. I will briefly consider the Munyuku design to show the directions in which interpretation might go (see fig. 7). The design represents wild honey and fire; it originated in ancestral action when the diamond pattern was burnt into the surface of a ceremonial object. The designs encode many elements of the wild honey complex. Yirritja moiety wild honey is associated with paperbark trees in the swamps. From this perspective the diamonds represent the wet season floodwaters. The white crosshatching is the foam on the raging waters, the cross pieces are logs being tossed around in the current, and the red and black crosshatching represents weeds being dragged along in the water. The honey is ready in the mid dry season when the land has dried out and the country is burnt by fires lit by hunters. The diamonds now represent the</page><page sequence="10">218 RES 47 SPRING 2005 Figure 7. Munyuku diamonds.

The red diamonds represent flames, the white ones smoke rising, the red and black ones are sparks flying, and the cross bar represents a log left behind by the fire edged with ash. The honey is now accessible and the diamond pattern represents the beehive itself. The white diamonds represent grubs, the red ones are cells filled with honey, and the crosspieces are sticks inside the hive. In the case of each clan's diamond pattern the interpretations of the diamonds will vary slightly according to the mythological events that took place in the country concerned. In the case of the crocodile, for example, some of the meanings refer to the pattern burnt into its skin by the fire. On the surface Abelam art could represent a very similar system, consisting as it does of geometric elements that look remarkably similar to northeast Arnhem Land designs. This apparent similarity provided an initial basis for Narritjin's interpretations (fig. 9). Geometric clan designs are present in all Yolngu sacred paintings. Sometimes the painting is comprised only of the clan design. The design may simply be outlined, the segments may be painted in red, yellow, white, or black pigment, or each segment may be infilled with elaborate crosshatching. The design signifies the clan and ancestral being associated with the painting and acts as a constraint on the interpretation of other elements. Both Narritjin and Banapana initially drew analogies between the geometric patterns in Abelam art and Yolngu clan designs. Narritjin unsurprisingly interpreted an Abelam diamond design as a wild honey/fire design similar to</page><page sequence="11">Morphy: Style and meaning 219 Figure 8. Madarrpa diamond design. The painting by Gumbaniya Marawili (born ca. 1933) represents the crocodile ancestor Baru at Yathikpa. The background pattern represents fire and the waters off shore. Copyright ? the artist, reproduced courtesy of Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Art Centre. those associated with the Munyuku and Dhalwangu clans. Indeed, designs looking almost identical to this occur as Yolngu body paintings.15 Another painting (fig. 10) characterized by zigzag patterns was interpreted as a design that his own clan, the Manggalili, shares with the Munyuku for salt and fresh water coming together. The most frequently occurring design element in the paintings Anthony collected were pointed ovals and sequences of triangles. The pointed oval is a central element in many of Narritjin's paintings. It is not strictly speaking a clan design but the shape of a sand sculpture used in mortuary rituals (see Morphy 1991 :ch. 11). The sand sculpture represents one that was made in the ancestral past (wangarr) by female ancestral women called Nyapililngu. The sand sculpture can be used to represent the bodies or parts of the bodies of the ancestral women in an analogous way to the Abelam tradition. Triangular patterns are closely associated with a group of Yirritja moiety clans that include the Yarrwidi Gumatj clan of Narritjin's maternal grandmother and a set of clans associated with the mythology of a race of ancestral hunters who came from overseas to visit the Arnhem Land coast. They can also occur as a design element in Manggalili clan paintings. One of the first paintings that Anthony Forge showed to Narritjin and Banapana contained both a pointed oval and a complex of triangular designs (fig. 11 ). The painting was initially interpreted by Banapana as looking like a butterfly. Narritjin, on the other hand, associated it with the lake at Djarrakpi made by the ancestral Nyaplililngu, with sand dunes on either side. He identified the yellow semicircles and the triangular patterns as sand dunes and the central feature as a yingapungapu sand sculpture, which in turn represents the lake. He thought that they might also represent the clouds that rise up above the lake and are associated with the symbolism of mortuary rituals. The bottom two figures were seen as triangles within triangles and, from a Yolngu perspective, were appropriately interpreted as clouds and sand hills associated with a Yirritja moiety clan. The central feature was said to represent a string girdle that the women wore around their breasts. Narritjin and Banapana had 15. According to Forge the Abelam interpretation of this was a string bag.</page><page sequence="12">220 RES 47 SPRING 2005 Figure 9.

It might be argued that Banapana, in interpreting the figure as a butterfly, was responding simply to its formal properties whereas Narritjin began by looking at it in terms of his own iconographical tradition. The dialogue between butterfly and Yolngu clan design continued as a theme for the next set of paintings. Narritjin began to emphasize the possible connection with the whale hunters, "to us it means sand dunes but to them from New Guinea, they are putting out cloud like the spout from the whale?connected to Balanda dreaming."16 In Narritjin's iconography the diamond design as cloud represents the distant horizon at the beginning of the wet season, the time when the mythical whale hunters would visit the Yolngu country. Narritjin interpreted a later painting (see fig. 11) as the home of the Balanda people, picking up on a structural detail of Yolngu painting in which a central feature surrounded by clan designs is seen as a representation of the djalkiri or foundation place of a clan. Once again, however, Banapana thought that it "might be a butterfly." At this point, Forge intervened, saying that this was precisely the meaning given by the Abelam and that indeed they interpreted the whole painting as butterfly. Banapana then said that the triangular pattern must represent the colors and pattern on the surface of the wings. The presence of the butterfly, however, contradicted the interpretation as clan design. Butterflies are Dhuwa and the triangular design is Yirritja. Yolngu paintings almost never combine Dhuwa and Yirritja elements together. So Narritjin concluded in this case that the painting as a whole might be representing Dhuwa and Yirritja people living together. A critical difference between Yolngu and Abelam paintings was beginning to emerge. They could not be interpreted on the same basis. Realizing this Banapana asked Forge: "Do they have anything like Dreaming tracks?" Forge replied: "They are not really about places, they are about spirits. But they don't think the spirits are ancestors, they are different." At which point I intervened: "So you are not connected to them," and Forge continued: "So there is no clan ownership. They have moieties and one moiety paints the other and then they reverse this next time. But they paint the same pictures." Narritjin laughed and said, "Yes I can see that." While Forge was out of the room Narritjin expressed concern about Abelam marriage practice: "Very good paintings, but no story. How are they born? Into the same group of people like a clan? How do they manage themselves?" I repeated that they did have two moieties, which Narritjin interpreted to be exogamous (as in the Yolngu case), continuing: "As long as they do that then they are good for marriages, if they were married according to their own blood then that would not be good for them." When Forge returned I said: "we were talking about if they were exogamous," and Forge replied "Well yes at the level of clan not moiety, but they don't marry into the same blood." "That is good," said Narritjin. Narritjin had thus identified fundamental differences between the Yolngu and Abelam systems which influenced the ways in which paintings were interpreted and the ways in which art articulated with social organization. Yolngu art is integral to the dynamics of moiety and clan organization and the identification of clan designs is part of the interpretative process. Much of the content of paintings is determined by the mythology of the place represented. Yirritja moiety paintings will only have Yirritja moiety animals and vice versa. The correct identification of the clan design thus provides guidance to interpreting other elements in the painting whether they are represented by figurative or geometric representations. Crocodiles, for example, are only associated with Yirritja moiety clans while certain kinds of sharks are associated with Dhuwa moiety clans. While Abelam paintings look as though they might be organized on such a basis, it does not take long to discover that they are not. When Narritjin and Banapana began looking for representational meaning in Abelam designs their interpretations were often quite close to Forge's and reflected principles used by Abelam in producing them (though from a Yolngu perspective). Many Abelam paintings include within them paintings of human figures and faces, often distorted and reorganized. Banapana, in Forge's words, became expert at identifying Abelam figures. Figure 12 was the first ?mage identified by Narritjin and Banapana as a face. They initially identified the mouth, teeth, and eye but also thought it might have the features of a butterfly. Forge then said that the pattern around the outside was said to represent a lizard skin and Narritjin said that he could use a similar pattern to represent a Yirritja goanna. Narritjin then turned the image upside down and pointed out that it also looked like a head the other way up. The next ?mage we looked at represents a whole body rather than a face (fig. 13). I tried to interpret it in Yolngu 16. The word balanda literally means white people. It comes from "Hollander," a word that entered the Yolngu language via the Macassan traders from South Sulawesi. In this context, however, it refers to a race of white sea hunters who preceded the Macassan visitors to Yolngu country and are celebrated in ritual.</page><page sequence="15">Morphy: Style and meaning 223 Figure 12.

"No," said Narritjin, "they think it is a body and those are the arms and legs. And we can see that they are hunting for fish." "And," said Banapana, "those are eyes up there." This interpretation greatly pleased Forge: "But if you ask the Abelam they say they are stars, but according to Forge they are eyes and you can see Banapana picked it in one." Narritjin then noticed that the motif seemed to repeat itself at the bottom and continued: "They say they're eyes here but what is in the bottom looks like eyes too! But which way up is it??very tricky." Narritjin quickly grasped the idea that many Abelam paintings could be interpreted as faces and tended to identify the elements at one level with similar meanings to those Forge recorded from the Abelam. As we looked at another painting (fig. 14) Forge said to Narritjin: "You are the expert on finding things?you pick out bits of faces which are true." Narritjin identified the painting initially as a face with two eyes and a nose in the center. When Anthony confirmed this identification Narritjin continued to develop further interpretations. He switched his reference point and suggested that the figures on the outside represented the person when he was alive and the central figures a whole lot of bones. The white circle that had previously been identified as the mouth became the skull and the white lines bones. He also said that the outside figures represented two faces looking in toward each other. Perhaps he saw the figures as combined eyes and mouths looking inward. In Narritjin's own paintings dead animal and human figures are painted in white?in contrast to living ones?and the transformation from life to death is a major theme. The next painting that Forge presented (fig. 15) again provoked an interesting discussion. Narritjin identified it as a human figure. Forge suggested a face with three eyes and Narritjin qualified it as really three people with three eyes. He thought that the pointed oval was probably a ceremonial ground and the semicircles on either side were sand dunes. He went on to suggest that the painting was deliberately designed to obscure meaning and to confuse the interpreter: "What they are giving you is a trick, they are putting a person but on the inside they are putting little bits of people [cut up] so you can't decide." A number of interesting points arose out of this process of interpretation. Narritjin and Banapana found the principles of Abelam bodily deconstruction easy to grasp. They interpreted the ambiguous and multiple ?mages partly according to the underlying principles of their own artistic system. The figures were transformational human figures which can have the characteristics of animal forms. But the interpretations came equally out of the structure of the paintings, the information they elicited from Anthony Forge about their meanings, and reflections on what significance the paintings might have in the context of Yolngu culture. They saw the paintings as comprising elements of animals and humans cut up and reassembled to contain elements of both. They used Forge as an informant to identify meanings of elements when he knew them. And they reflected on what the significance of the particular combinations might be. One conclusion that they came to was that the paintings represented spirit beings and that many alluded to transformations between animal forms, in particular butterflies and human beings. The</page><page sequence="17">Morphy: Style and meaning 225 Figure 14. Abelam face motif, photo by Anthony Forge, from the Anthony Forge Papers, Mandeville Special Collections Library, University of California, San Diego. ?dea of transformational spirit beings is salient to Yolngu artists since their own system of representation ?s centrally concerned with representations of transformational ancestral beings (see Morphy 1989). The connection with butterflies suggested a particular association with the Dhuwa moiety land of the dead, Buralku, since butterflies abound there and have resonance with human spirits. The dissected human or animal body is a familiar theme of Yolngu culture. The bodies of ancestral beings are distributed throughout the landscape where they have been transformed into features of the environment. In mortuary rituals and initiation ceremonies across Arnhem Land ?mages of the divided body abound. It is also significant that Narritjin in this context and on other occasions suggested a way in which Abelam art might function as a system of restricted revelatory knowledge. The three eyes might be there to suggest three people but maybe this was deliberately misleading. Certainly Narritjin's view of Abelam art would be consistent with Forge's, that "there is no line to be drawn between representational and abstract art." I suggested at the beginning of the paper that Narritjin's and Banapana's interpretations of Abelam art were never as distanced as Forge's, never as much an "outsider's" view.17 Although they were able to identify key differences between the structure of Yolngu and Abelam art, their interpretative process nonetheless attempted to incorporate Abelam art within their own system of meaning. Art is one of the ways in which Yolngu have incorporated outsiders in their world; they use their own structures to transform outsiders into insiders. I have shown elsewhere how the Macassan traders became incorporated within the Yolngu universe by being projected into the ancestral past as ancestral beings of the Yirritja moiety (Morphy 1991:140-141 ). People from New Guinea are linked with the same mythology, and the ancestral world from whence they come is said to be the Yirritja moiety land of the dead.18 17. Interestingly Forge referred explicitly to the outsider's perspective he adopted as something that facilitated interpretation, or perhaps rather enabled the analyst to make explicit what to members of the culture was implicit: "Further, some of the disentangling of the structures from the readily available facts?art works, ethnoclassif?cation, language, mythology?is easy or even obvious to someone knowledgeable about the culture but not of it and hence not endangered by the analysis" (Forge 1979:286). However he recognized that this distanced and objectivist stance was not sufficient in itself. While not denying the validity of the insights it produced he went on to note: "There are, moreover, homologies of form which one's own socialization may make one blind to; there are chains of puns that seem to lead nowhere; there are all the other untidy bits that indicate inadequate fieldwork and defective comprehension. Yet the patterns are there. They relate to each other and to other patterns in other media from the same culture, and their existence, their interrelatedness, their coherence as meaning, and their coming together in behaviour constitute the proof" (Ibid.). 18. Narritjin indeed interpreted one of the paintings in relation to a Yolngu story of a visit to the land of the dead. Narritjin said: "The old</page><page sequence="18">226 RES 47 SPRING 2005 Figure 15. Human figure, photo by Anthony Forge, from the Anthony Forge Papers, Mandeville Special Collections Library, University of California, San Diego. To Narritjin and Banapana it was no coincidence that designs from coastal clans of the Yirritja moiety figured prominently in Abelam art. This mythology became a reference point for interpreting many of the paintings. Narritjin used the term Balanda to refer to the New Guineans (Abelam), a term which today is used mainly as the polite word for Europeans. This came out clearly in the interpretation of one painting (fig. 16), when Narritjin and Banapana refused to adopt Anthony's interpretation as the most relevant one. The painting is another representation of two human figures, on this occasion headless. Discussion of the painting began a little embarrassingly. Narritjin reasonably thought that the representations were of two flying foxes. Forge said: "No it is not flying foxes." I then said "I couldn't even guess," which elicited the cutting response: "You haven't been to any of my lectures have you??No it is the human body again and this is the big ornament made out of baler shell." And then Narritjin took over: "They are looking for whale, that is the sea grass and this is the fire place here and here for cooking up the whale." In later paintings Narritjin identified the baler shell ornament as a representation of the knife used to cut up the whale, the colored segments as pieces of whale, or the spout of the whale. On another painting he identified the diamond designs as representing one of its other meanings: the flags put up by the Balanda people and which Yolngu use today in mortuary rituals. The mythology of the Balanda is associated with whale hunting. Yolngu paintings focus on the cutting up of the whale into various parts for division among relatives. The paintings represent the skin, flesh, and blubber and often include the knife used to cut it up. The whales are connected with the wet season. The spout of the ancestral whale is thought to create rain clouds represented by the anvil shape of the tail. In Yolngu paintings the triangular patterns represent the wet season clouds lined up on the horizon and the effect of light reflected through them. The whale is rarely represented figuratively and the paintings usually comprise geometric elements. Figure 17 is an example of a Lamamirri clan painting of the whale by Deturru Yunupingu. In Deturru's painting the triangular patterns in red, yellow, black, and white represent the wet season clouds on the horizon. The knives represent ones used to cut up the whale, the central zigzag pattern is rough water covering a rock that is a transformation of the body of the whale. The tail of the whale is shown floating in calm water at the bottom and at the top the figure alludes to the tail, the spume of the whale, and storm clouds. In other paintings of the whale bands of color are interpreted as cut up pieces of the whale. Neither Narritjin nor Banapana thought that they were interpreting the paintings as Abelam themselves would have. Rather they entered into a process of interpretation and comparison that moved them towards an interpretation of Abelam art and its relationship to their own. In interpreting paintings as representations of human faces and bodies they adopted Forge's "Abelam" perspective. They attempted to see the paintings as people call this one here the spirit people been in New Guinea and the islands" and Banapana added: "Aboriginal people they go as spirit people to New Guinea. They think all the coconut tree on the beach come from New Guinea." Narritjin elaborated: "Yalangura (a G?lpu clan man] travelled all the way to New Guinea by canoe and when he got there they asked him if he was dead or alive. Alive! Well you got to go back to your country and return when you are dead. And when he returned to the mainland he told the story that live people are not allowed to go to there, you have to die before you can go there."</page><page sequence="19">Morphy: Style and meaning 227 Figure 16. Two human figures, photo by Anthony Forge, from the Anthony Forge Papers, Mandeville Special Collections Library, University of California, San Diego. Abelam saw them. They deemphasized the placedness of Yolngu art, its reference to landscape, and its close association with a system of clanship. In other cases, such as in the case of the whale hunters, they developed avenues of interpretation that on the surface moved some of the paintings well away from Abelam experience. The association of a number of the paintings with the mythology of Balanda whale hunters that belongs to a set of Yirritja moiety clans, came more out of the form of art rather than any information that they could elicit from Forge. They knew that the Abelam did not hunt whales and had established that the designs were not directly linked with patrilineal clan organization. Yet a number of things about the paintings persuaded them of the salience of their interpretations. The whale hunters who visited Yolngu country in the past were associated with New Guinea and eastern Indonesia. The whale hunters were associated with spirits of the dead as they understood the Abelam paintings to be. In Yolngu myth the whale hunters themselves were transformed eventually by fire into flying foxes,?the form in which they return to Yolngu country to this day?and flying fox was given by Forge as a meaning to elements on the same set of paintings. But more than anything else it was the formal elements of the paintings that kept bringing them back to the whale hunters,?the triangular patterns of the wet season clouds, the knives that were used to cut up the bodies of the whale. The strips of whale that they saw in the paintings, the crosshatching that referred to whale fat and flesh, and the black curved forms that hinted at the whale's tail and cloud, made the interpretations hard to resist. In the paintings Narritjin saw whale. But it was a mythical whale that is characterized as much by its absence as its presence. Of the Abelam paintings Narritjin said: "You never put out the picture of the whale. But every time you show me one of these paintings I know it is still on the whale side." He was referring to the whale in Abelam art but he could equally have been referring to the whale in Yolngu art. Deturru's painting of the whale is as literal a representation of a whale as one ever gets in Yolngu paintings and it is usually much more hidden than this. The Balanda mythology as a whole is concerned with transformation and passage across the seas, positioning Yolngu cosmology in relation to the wider world outside. The mythology provides a basis for the symbolism of Yirritja moiety mortuary rituals in which different elements are associated with different stages of the ceremony. The cutting up of the whale meat, for example, is associated with the division of responsibilities of kin in the ceremony and is also a metaphor for the process of bodily decay and disintegration following death. The process of interpretation Narritjin and Banapana were engaged in here runs parallel to the more analytic approach they adopted to other aspects of Abelam art and is part of the process of incorporating outsiders on the edge of their known social universe within an existing though changing framework of understanding. Conclusion What have we learned about the relationship between Abelam and Yolngu art? Perhaps as important, what have we learned about the properties of each system from adopting a comparative perspective? Anthropologists have always been aware of the</page><page sequence="20">228 RES 47 SPRING 2005 Figure 17.

Gradually, over time, the questions and methods change as part of the process and become more sensitive to the cultures studied. In this paper, I have described a mediated discussion in which Abelam art was analyzed in relation to Yolngu art. Anthony Forge approached Abelam art with two key questions in mind. One, derived from the history of western art, concerned the significance of form in art, in particular, the relationship between representation and abstraction. The other came out of the symbolic anthropology of the 1960s and concerned what the art "meant." Forge concluded that the distinction between abstract and representational art was unhelpful in analyzing Abelam art. As far as meaning was concerned Abelam art was a closed system in which meaning was generated internally by the relationship between formal elements. He came to this conclusion partly because the Abelam did not provide the kind of answers to the question of meaning that he anticipated. While they gave meanings for individual elements and sometimes a name for a whole painting, they did not come out with detailed exegesis of their art?they appeared to have no stories. Narritjin's and Banapana's interventions in Anthony Forge's analysis of Abelam art are of interest partly because they challenge the assumption that questions about meaning in art are in themselves somehow Eurocentric. Forge's question, "what does it mean?" was an entirely reasonable one to Narritjin and Banapana, and they found the absence of myth or story just as puzzling as he did. And like Forge they drew conclusions that moved interpretation in a different direction, towards transformation, towards restricted knowledge, directions in which Diane Losche's analyses of Abelam art also turned. They responded to the "aesthetics" of Abelam art seeing the brilliant surface forms reflected in the designs, the colors of the butterfly's wings and the lizard's skin. And they also began to learn Abelam conventions of figurative representation. While Narritjin and Banapana had been exposed to my own line of questioning about meaning I believe that the questions they posed about Abelam art were very much their own and reflected in turn differences between Yolngu and Abelam art. They also suggest that the puzzles of the anthropology of art are not solely a western concern. The simple answer to the difference between Yolngu and Abelam art might be that the Yolngu do have stories. However, this is misleading since Yolngu stories are not what the painting represents but a parallel genre which articulates with art. Yolngu paintings are also a product of the fact that Yolngu use art as a general system of communication and have a tradition of exegesis. Yolngu art, in comparison with Abelam flat painting, is a highly differentiated system. In Yolngu art many different kinds of meaning can be encoded and art can be used for different purposes in different contexts. Narritjin's interrogation of Abelam art revealed some of the key features of Yolngu art: it contains a system of clan designs which precisely identify the relationships between people, place, and ancestral being. The system is a flexible one that can accommodate changing relationships and is integral to the ongoing politics of Yolngu society. However, it is important to stress that in the system of clan designs it is possible to encode complex messages with a minimum of ambiguity. This level of specificity is absent from the Abelam system. However, in other areas Yolngu art is every bit as open-ended and ambiguous as Abelam art. Yolngu geometric art is multivalent and many different meanings can be condensed in the same form, as in the case of the wild honey/fire design. This multivalency is exploited to make connections between things and to create metaphors in the Yolngu case, as it is in the</page><page sequence="21">Morphy: Style and meaning 229 Abelam case. In both artistic systems, however, it is necessary to recognize that there are different ways in which the same meaning can be encoded and that different ways of encoding influence the way the meanings are understood and interpreted. In the Yolngu case there is, in addition, a tradition of figurative representation that can encode many of the meanings of the geometric art. In both the Abelam and Yolngu case, however, meaning is conveyed by the relationships between representations as well as by the representations themselves. The fact that a nggwalndu ancestor can be represented in human figure form or deconstructed into various component parts is an integral feature of the Abelam system. In Yolngu art this type of deconstruction is exploited in many ways. The capacity to represent ancestral beings in different forms, ranging from figurative representations to particular combinations of geometric forms, enables the transformative nature of ancestral beings to be conveyed (Morphy 1989). It also enables them to be understood as abstractions that are only partially manifest in any one representation. Yolngu art is also concerned with those fundamental themes of human existence that Forge identifies as the real "meaning" of Abelam art. The issue which he comes back to again and again is that of the relationship between men and women and the fact that "women are generally considered the inferiors of men throughout Australia and New Guinea but analyses of the ritual system in both areas . . . [reveal] women to be truly creative and naturally powerful" (Forge 1979:286). Forge argues that art and ritual exploit and articulate such fundamental contradictions, "giving fundamental comprehension of the culture at an emotional as well as an intellectual level." But he also goes on to say that such meanings are unlikely to be articulated verbally perhaps precisely because they are not fully worked out or fully expressible in a simple sentence, and hence the absence of stories in Abelam art. While I do not entirely agree with Forge's conclusions there are many areas of Yolngu art too where meanings remain implicit, and often they are concerned with the nature of things, with relationships between things, and of course with relationships between men and women. I will conclude with a painting by Narritjin (fig. 18) which delighted Anthony when he saw it, and which would have communicated well to an Abelam interpreter.19 It shares Figure 18. Yingapungapu and digging stick. This painting by Narritjin Maymuru (1916-1981) represents two ancestral women, the Nyapililngu on either side of a figure that represents both a digging stick and the elliptical shape of a sand sculpture, the yingapungapu.

However the meanings of the set of paintings of which this is a part are discussed in detail in the chapters on Manggalili iconography in my book Ancestral Connections (Morphy 1991).</page><page sequence="22">230 RES 47 SPRING 2005 a key iconographie element with Abelam art: a pointed oval. We may remember that the pointed oval on the frieze of women in the house fa?ade became, lower down, the contour that outlined the face of the male nggwalndu figures, the implicit meaning being the male face incorporated within the ancestral vulva. In Narritjin's painting we have an analogous set of incorporations. In the center is a sacred object, a digging stick, representing an ancestral being. It is acknowledged to have a phallic reference. The figure is repeated within two human figures on either side. The figures are ancestral women and the digging stick is included within an outer ellipse which represents her pregnant stomach. Narritjin said the digging stick is her baby. What could the meaning be of a woman being pregnant with a penis? Ask Freud or Forge, an Abelam or a Yolngu. But don't expect a straight answer.
