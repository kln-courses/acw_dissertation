<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONTENT AND VALIDITY OF THE CAUSAL LAW.' We have learned to regard the real, which we endeavor to apprehend scientifically in universally valid judgments, as a whole that is connected continuously in time and in space and by cau- sation, and that is accordingly continuously self-evolving. This continuity of connection has the following result, viz., every at- tempt to classify the sum total of the sciences on the basis of the difference of their objects leads merely to representative types, i. e., to species which glide into one another. We find no gaps by means of which we can separate sharply physics and chem- istry, botany and zoology, political and economic history and the histories of art and religion, or, again, history, philology, and the study of the prehistoric. As are the objects, so also are the methods of science. They are separable one from another only through a division into rep- resentative types; for the variety of these methods is dependent upon the variety of the objects of our knowledge, and is, at the same time, determined by the difference between the manifold forms of our thought, itself a part of the real, with its elements also gliding into one another.2 The threads which join the general methodology of scientific thought with neighboring fields of knowledge run in two main directions. In the one direction they make up a closely packed cable, whereas in the other their course diverges into all the di- mensions of scientific thought. That is to say, first, methodology has its roots in logic, in the narrower sense, viz., in the science of the elementary forms of our thought which enter into the make-up of all scientific methods. Secondly, methodology has its source in the methods themselves which actually, and there- I This article is an enlargement of a paper read before the Section for Methodology of Science, International Congress of Arts and Sciences, St. Louis, I904.

It is the office of scientific thought to interpret validly the ob- jects that are presented to us in outer and inner perception, and that can be derived from both these sources. We accomplish this interpretation entirely through judgments and combinations of judgments of manifold sorts. The concepts, which the older logic regarded as the true elementary forms of our thinking, are only certain selected types of judgment, such stereotyped judg- ments as those which make up definitions and classifications, and which appear independent and fundamental because their subject- matter, i. e., their intension or extension, is connected through the act of naming with certain words. Scientific methods, then, are the ways and means by which our thought can accomplish and set forth, in accordance with its ideal, this universally valid interpretation. There belongs, accordingly, to methodology a list of problems which we can divide, to be sure only in abstract, into three sepa- rate groups. First, methodology has to analyze the methods which have been technically developed in the different fields of knowledge into the elementary forms of our thinking from which they have been built up. Next to this work of analyzing, there comes a second task which may be called a normative one; for it follows that we must set forth and deduce systematically from their sources the nature of these manifold elements, their result- ing connection, and their validity. To these two offices must be added a third that we may call a potiori a synthetic one; for finally we must reconstruct out of the elements of our thinking, as revealed by analysis, the methods belonging to the different fields of knowledge and also determine their different scope and validity. The beginning of another conception of the office of method- ology can be found in those thoughts which have become signifi- cant, especially in Leibniz's fragments and drafts of a calculus ratiocinator or a specieuse generate. The foregoing discussion has set aside all hope that these beginnings and their recent develop- ment may give, of the possibility of constructing the manifold</page><page sequence="3">I40 THE PHILOSOPHJCAL REVIEW [VOL. XIV. possible methods a priori, i. e., before or independent of experi- ence. However, it remains entirely undecided, as it should in this our preliminary account of the office of general methodol- ogy, whether or not all methods of our scientific thought will prove to be ultimately but branches of one and the same universal method, a thought contained in the undertakings just referred to. Although modern empiricism, affiliated as it is with natural science, tends to answer this question in the affirmative even more defi- nitely and dogmatically than any type of the older rationalism, still the question is one that can be decided only in the course of methodological research. The conception of a methodology of scientific thought can be said to be almost as old as scientific thought itself; for it is already contained essentially, though undifferentiated, in the Socratic challenge of knowledge. None the less, the history of methodol- ogy, as the history of every other science, went through the course of which Kant has given a classical description. " No one attempts to construct a science unless he can base it on some idea; but in the elaboration of it the schema, nay, even the defi- nition which he gives in the beginning of his science, corresponds very seldom to his idea, which, like a germ, lies hidden in the reason, and all the parts of which are still enveloped and hardly distinguishable even under microscopical observation." 1 We are indebted to the Greek, and especially to the Platonic- Aristotelian, philosophy for important contributions to the under- standing of the deductive method of mathematical thought. It was precisely this trend of philosophic endeavor which, though furnishing for the most part the foundation of methodological doctrine well on into the seventeenth century, offered no means of differentiating the methods that are authoritative for our knowledge of facts. What Socrates was perhaps the first to call 'induction,' is essentially different, as regards its source and aim, from the inductive methods that direct our research in natural and mental science. For it is into these two fields that we have to divide the totality of the sciences of facts, the material sciences, let us call them, in opposition to the formal or mathematical I Kant, Kr. d. r. V, 2d ed., p. 862.</page><page sequence="4">No. 2.] CONTENT AND VALIDITY OF CAUSAL LAW. I4I sciences,- i. e., if we are to do justice to the difference between sense and self-perception, or ' outer' and ' inner' perception. Two closely connected forces especially led astray the method- ological opinions regarding the material sciences till the end of the eighteenth century, and in part until the beginning of the nine- teenth century. We refer, in the first place, to that direction of thought which gives us the right to characterize the Platonic- Aristotelian philosophy as a 'concept philosophy'; viz., the circumstance that Aristotelian logic caused the ' concept' to be set before the 'judgment.' In short, we refer to that ten- dency in thought which directs the attention not to the permanent in the world's occurrences, the uniform connections of events, but rather to the seemingly permanent in the things, their essential attributes or essences. Thus the concept philosophy, as a result of its tendency to hypostasize, finds in the abstract general concepts of things, the Ideas, the eternal absolute reality that constitutes the foundation of things and is contained in them beside the accidental and changing properties.' Here we have at once the second force which inspired the ancient methodology. These Ideas, like the fundamentally real, constitute that which ultimately alone acts in all the coming into existence and the going out of existence of the manifold things. In the Aris- totelian theory of causation, this thought is made a principle; and we formulate only what is contained in it, when we say that, according to it, the efficient and at the same time final causes can be deduced through mere analysis from the essential content of the effects; that, in fact, the possible effects of every cause can be deduced from the content of its definition. The conceptual determination of the causal-relation, and with it in principle the sum total of the methods in the material sciences, becomes a logical, analytical, and deductive one. These sciences remain entirely independent of the particular content of experience as this broadens, and so do also the methods under discussion. I According to Plato, it is true, the Tdeas are separated from the sensible things; they must be thought in a conceptual place, for the space of sense-perception is to be understood as non-Being, matter. The things revealed to sense, however, occupy a middle position between Being and non-Being, so that they partake of the Ideas. In this sense, the statement made above holds also of the older view of the concept philosophy.</page><page sequence="5">142 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIV. As a consequence, every essential difference between mathe- matical thought and the science of causes is done away with in favor of a rationalistic construction of the methods of material science. Accordingly, throughout the seventeenth century, the ideal of all scientific method becomes, not the inductive method that founded the new epoch of the science of to-day, but the de- ductive mathematical method applied to natural scientific research. The flourish of trumpets with which Francis Bacon hailed the onslaught of the inductive methods in the natural science of the time, helped in no way; for he failed to remodel the traditional, Aristotelian-Scholastic conception of cause, and, accordingly, failed to understand both the problem of induction and the mean- ing of the inductive methods of the day. 1 Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, and related thinkers develop their mathesis universalis after the pattern of geometrical thinking. Leibniz tries to adapt his specieuse generate to the thought of mathematical analysis. The old methodological conviction gains its clear-cut expression in Spinoza's doctrine: "Aliquid efficitur ab aliqua re" means " aliquid sequitur ex ejus definitione." The logically straight path is seldom the one taken in the course of the history of thought. The new formulation and solu- tion of problems influence us first through their evident signifi- cance and consequences, not through the traditional presupposi- tions upon which they are founded. Thus, in the middle of the seventeenth century, when insight into the precise difference between mental and physical events gave rise to pressing need for its definite formulation, no question arose concerning the dogmatic presupposition of a purely logical (analytisch) relation- ship between cause and effect; but, on the contrary, this presup- position was then for the first time brought clearly before consciousness. It was necessary to take the roundabout way through occasionalism and the preestablished harmony, includ- ing the latter's retreat to the omnipotence of God, before it was possible to raise the question of the validity of the presupposition that the connection between cause and effect is analytic and rational. 1 Cf the articles on Francis Bacon by Chr. Sigwart in the Preussische jahrbilcher, XII, I863, and XIII, i864.</page><page sequence="6">No. 2.] CONTENT AND VALIDITY OF CA USAL LAW. I43 Among the leading thinkers of the period this problem was recognized as the cardinal problem of contemporaneous philos- ophy. It is further evidence how thoroughly established this problem must have been among the more deeply conceived problems of the time in the middle of the eighteenth century, that Hume and Kant were forced to face it, led on, seemingly independently of each other, and surely from quite different pre- suppositions and along entirely different ways. The historical evolution of that which from the beginning has seemed to phi- losophy the solving of her true problem, has come to pass in a way not essentially different from that of the historical evolution in all other departments of human knowledge. Thus, in the last third of the seventeenth century, Newton and Leibniz succeeded in setting forth the elements of the infinitesimal calculus; and, in the fifth decade of the nineteenth century, Robert Mayer, Helm- holtz, and perhaps Joule, formulated the law of the conservation of energy. In one essential respect Hume and Kant are agreed in the solution of the new, and hence contemporaneously misunderstood, problem. Both realized that the connection between the various causes and effects is not a rational analytic, but an empirical syn- thetic one. However, the difference in their presuppositions as well as method caused this common result to make its appear- ance in very different light and surroundings. In Hume's empiri- cism the connection between cause and effect appears as the mere empirical result of association; whereas in Kant's rationalism this general relation between cause and effect becomes the funda- mental condition of all possible experience, and is, as a conse- quence, independent of all experience. It rests, as a means of connecting our ideas, upon an inborn uniformity of our thought. Thus the way was opened for a fundamental separation of the inductive material-scientific from the deductive mathematical method. For Hume mathematics becomes the science of the relations of ideas, as opposed to the sciences of facts. For Kant philosophical knowledge is the knowledge of the reason arising from concepts, whereas the mathematical is that arising from the construction of concepts. The former, therefore, studies the par-</page><page sequence="7">144 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIV. ticular only in the universal; the latter, the universal in the par- ticular, nay, rather in the individual. Both solutions of the new problem which in the eighteenth century supplant the old and seemingly self-evident presupposi- tion, appear accordingly embedded in the opposition between the rationalistic and empiristic interpretation of the origin and validity of our knowledge, the same opposition that from antiquity runs through the historical development of philosophy in ever new digressions. Even to-day the question regarding the meaning and the validity of the causal connection stands between these contrary directions of epistemological research; and the ways leading to its answer separate more sharply than ever before. It is there- fore more pressing in our day than it was in earlier times to find a basis upon which we may build further epistemologically and therefore methodologically. The purpose of the present paper is to seek such a basis for the different methods employed in the sciences of facts. As has already been said, the contents of our consciousness, which are given us immediately in outer and inner perception, constitute the raw material of the sciences of facts. From these various facts of perception we derive the judgments through which we predict, guide, and shape our future perception in the course of possible experience. These judgments exist in the form 01 reproductive ideational processes, which, if logically explicit, be- come inductive inferences in the broader sense. These inferences may be said to be of two sorts, though fundamentally only two sides of one and the same process of thought; they are in part analogical inferences and in part inductive inferences in the narrower sense. The former infers from the particular in a present percep- tion, which in previous perceptions was uniformly connected with other particular contents of perception, to a particular that re- sembles those other contents of percepton. In short, they are in- ferences from a particular to a particular. After the manner of such inferences we logically formulate, for example, the repro- ductive processes, whose conclusions run: ' This man whom I see</page><page sequence="8">No. 2.] CONTENT A.ND VALIDITY OF CAUSAL LAW. 145 before me, is attentive, feels pain, will die'; ' this meteor will prove to have a chemical composition similar to known meteors, and also to have corresponding changes on its surface as the result of its rapid passage through our atmosphere.' The inductive in- ferences in the narrower sense argue, on the contrary, from the perceptions of a series of uniform phenomena to a universal, which includes the given and likewise all possible cases, in which a member of the particular content of the earlier perceptions is presupposed as given. In short, they are conclusions from a par- ticular to a universal that is more extensive than the sum of the given particulars. For example: 'All men have minds, will die'; 'all meteoric stones will prove to have this chemical composition and those changes of surface.' There is no controversy regarding the inner similarity of both these types of inference or regarding their outward structure; or, again, regarding their outward difference from the deductive in- ferences, which proceed not from a particular to a particular or general, but from a general to a particular. There is, however, difference of opinion regarding their inner structure and their inner relation to the deductive inferences. Both questions depend upon the decision regarding the meaning and validity of the causal relation. The contending parties are recruited essentially from the positions of traditional empiricism and rationalism and from their modern offshoots. We maintain first of all: i. The presupposition of all inductive inferences, from now on to be taken in their more general sense, is, that the contents of perception are given to us uniformly in repeated perceptions, i. e., in uniform components and uniform relations. 2. The condition of the validity of the inductive inferences lies in the thoughts that the same causes will be present in the unob- served realities as in the observed ones, and that these same causes will bring forth the same effects. 3. The conclusions of all inductive inferences have, logically speaking, purely problematic validity, i. e., their contradictory op- posite remains equally thinkable. They are, accurately expressed, merely hypotheses, whose validity needs verification through future experience.</page><page sequence="9">I46 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW, [VOL. XIV. The first mentioned presupposition of inductive inference must not be misunderstood. The paradox that nothing really repeats itself, that each stage in nature's process comes but once, is just as much and just as little justified as the assertion, everything has already existed. It does not deny the fact that we can discrim- inate in the contents of our perceptions the uniformities of their components and relations, in short, that similar elements are present in these ever new complexes. This fact makes it possi- ble that our manifold perceptions combine to make up one con- tinuous experience. Even our paradox presupposes that the different contents of our perceptions are comparable with one another, and reveal accordingly some sort of common nature. All this is not only a matter of course for empiricism, which founds the whole constitution of our knowledge upon habits, but must also be granted by every rationalistic interpretation of the structure of knowledge. Every one that is well-informed knows that what we ordinarily refer to as facts already includes a theory regarding them. Kant judges in this matter precisely as Hume did before him and Stuart Mill after him. "If cinnabar were sometimes red and sometimes black, sometimes light and some- times heavy, if a man could be changed now into this, now into another animal shape, if on the longest day the fields were some- times covered with fruit, sometimes with ice and snow, the faculty of my empirical imagination would never be in a position, when representing red color, to think of heavy cinnabar."' The assumption that in recurring perceptions similar elements of content, as well as of relation, are given, is a necessary con- dition of the possibility of experience itself, and accordingly of all those processes of thought which lead us, under the guidance of previous perceptions, from the contents of one given perception to the contents of possible perceptions. A tradition from Hume down has accustomed us to associate the relation of cause and effect not so much with the uniformity of coexistence as with the uniformity of sequence. Let us for the present keep to this tradition. Its first corollary is that the relation of cause and effect is to be sought in the uninterrupted IKant, Kr. d. r. V., listed , pp. Ioof.</page><page sequence="10">No. 2.] CONTENT AND VALIDITY OF CA USAL LA W. 147 flow and connection of events and changes. The cause becomes the uniformly preceding event, the constant antecedens, the effect the uniformly following, the constant consequent, in the course of the changes that are presented to consciousness as a result of foregoing changes in our sensorium. According to this tradition that we have taken as our point of departure, the uniformity of the sequence of events is a necessary presupposition of the relation between cause and effect. This uniformity is given us as an element of our experience; for we actually find uniform successions in the course of the changing contents of perception. Further, as all our perceptions are in the first instance sense-perceptions, we may call them the sensory presupposition of the possibility of the causal relation. In this presupposition, however, there is much more involved than the name just chosen would indicate. The uniformity of sequence lies, as we saw, not in the contents of perception as such, which are immediately given to us. It arises rather through the fact that, in the course of repeated perceptions, we apprehend through abstraction the uniformities of their temporal relation. Moreover, there lie in the repeated perceptions not only uniform- ities of sequence, but also uniformities of the qualitative content of the successive events themselves, and these uniformities also must be apprehended through abstraction. Thus these uniform contents of perception make up series of the following form: al &gt; b n G The presupposition of the possibility of the casual relations in- cludes, therefore, more than mere perceptive elements. It in- volves the relation of different, if you will, of peculiar contents of perception, by virtue of which we recognize ad2o- b2 . . . a -&gt; bn as events that resemble one another and the event al &gt; b, qual- itatively as well as in their sequence. There are accordingly in-</page><page sequence="11">I48 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIV. volved in our presupposition reproductive elements which indi- cate the action of memory. In order that I may in the act of perceiving a73 f- - b3 apprehend the uniformity of this present con- tent with that of a2 &gt;-- b2 and al &gt; b, these earlier perceptions must in some way, perhaps through memory,' be revived with the present perception. In this reproduction there is still a further element, which can be separated, to be sure, only in abstract from the one just pointed out. The present revived content, even if it is given in memory as an independent mental state, is essentially different from the original perception. It differs in all the modifica- tions in which the memory of lightning and thunder could differ from the perception of their successive occurrence, or, again, the memory of a pain and the resulting disturbance of attention could differ from the corresponding original experience. How- ever, as memory, the revived experience presents itself as a pic- ture of that which has been previously perceived. Especially is this the case in memory properly so called, where the peculiar space and time relations individualize the revived experience. If we give to this identifying element in the associative process a logical expression, we shall have to say that there is involved in revival, and especially in memory, an awareness that the present ideas recall the same content that was previously given us in perception. To be sure, the revival of the content of previous perceptions does not have to produce ideas, let alone memories. Rapid, transitory, or habitual revivals, stimulated by associative processes, can remain unconscious, i. e., they need not appear as ideas or states of consciousness. Stimulation takes place, but consciousness does not arise, provided we mean by the term 'consciousness' the genus of our thoughts, feelings, and voli- tions. None the less it must not be forgotten that this aware- ness of the essential identity of the present revived content with that of the previous perception can be brought about in every 1 It is not our present concern to ascertain how this actually happens. The psy- chological presuppositions of the present paper are contained in the theory of repro- duction that I have worked out in connection with the psychology of speech in the articles on "Die psychologischen Grundlagen der Beziehungen zwischen Sprechen und Denken."

How all this takes place is not our present problem. We can apply to this second element in the reproductive process, which we have found to be essential to the causal rela- tion, a Kantian term, 'Recognition.' This term, however, is to be taken only in the sense called for by the foregoing statements; for the rationalistic presuppositions and consequences which mark Kant's "Synthesis of Recognition" are far removed from the present line of thought. We may, then, sum up our results as follows: In the presuppo- sition of a uniform sequence of events, which we have accepted from tradition as the necessary condition of the possibilityof the causal relation, there lies the thought that the contents of per- ception given us through repeated sense-stimulation are related to one another through a reproductive recognition. The assumption of such reproductive recognition is not justi- fied merely in the cases so far considered. It is already neces- sary in the course of the individual perceptions a and b, and hence in the apprehension of an occurrence, It makes the sequence itself in which a and b are joined possible; for in order to apprehend b as following upon a, in case the perception of a has not persisted in its original form, a must be as far revived and recognized upon b's entrance into the field of perception as it has itself passed out of that field. Otherwise, instead of b following upon a and being related to a, there would be only the relation- less change from a to b. This holds generally and not merely in the cases where the perception of a has disappeared before that of b begins, e. g., in the case of lightning and thunder, or where it has in part disappeared, e. g., in the throwing of a stone. We have represented a as an event or change, in order that uniform sequences of events may alone come into consideration as the presupposition of the causal relation. But every event has its course in time, and is accordingly divisible into many, ulti- mately into infinitely many, shorter events. Now if b comes only an infinitely short interval later than a, and by hypothesis it must come later than a, then a corresponding part of a must have dis- appeared by the time b appears. But the infinitesimal part of a</page><page sequence="13">150 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XIV. perception is just as much out of all consideration as would be an infinitely long perception; all which only goes to show that we have to substitute intervals of finite length in place of this purely conceptual analysis of a continuous time interval. This leaves the foregoing discussion as it stands. If b follows a after a perceptible finite interval, then the flow or development of a by the time of b's appearance must have covered a course corre- sponding to that interval; and all this is true even though the earlier stages of a remain unchanged throughout the interval preceding b's appearance. The present instant of flow is distinct from the one that has passed, even though it takes place in pre- cisely the same way. The former, not the latter, gives the basis of relation which is here required, and therefore the former must be reproduced and recognized. This thought also is included in the foregoing summary of what critical analysis shows to be in- volved in the presupposition of a uniform sequence. In all this we have already abandoned the field of mere percep- tion which gave us the point of departure for our analysis of uniform sequence. We may call the changing course of percep- tion only in the narrower meaning the sensory presupposition of the causal relation. In order that these changing contents of perception may be known as like one another, as following one another, and as following one another uniformly, they must be related to one another through a recognitive reproduction. Our critical analysis of uniform sequence is, however, not yet complete. To relate to one another the contents of two ideas always requires a process at once of identifying and of differentiat- ing, which makes these contents members of the relation, and which accordingly presupposes that our attention has been directed to each of the two members as well as to the relation itself, - in the present case, to the sequence. Here we come to another essential point. We should apply the name 'thought' to every ideational process in which attention is directed to the elements of the mental content and which leads us to identify with one another, or to differentiate from one another, the members of this content.' The act of relating, which knows two events as similar, 'Cf. the author's "Umrisse zur Psychologie des Denkens," in Philosophische Abhandlungen CAr;. Sigzwar/ . . . gewidmet, Tiibingen, i900.</page><page sequence="14">No. 2.] CONTENT AN4ID VALIDITY OF CA USAL LAW I 5' as following one another, indeed, as following one another uni- formly, is therefore so far from being a sensation that it must be claimed to be an act of thinking. The uniformity of sequence of a and b is therefore an act of relating on the part of our thought, so far as this becomes possible solely through the fact that we at one and the same time identify with one another and differentiate from one another a as cause and b as effect. We say "at one and the same time," because the terms identify- ing and differentiating are correlatives which denote two dif- ferent and opposing sides of one and the same ideational proc- ess viewed logically. Accordingly, there is here no need of emphasizing that the act of relating, which enables us to think a as cause and b as effect, is an act of thought also, because it pre- supposes on our part an act of naming which raises it to being a component of our formulated and discursive thought. We there- fore think a as cause and b as effect in that we apprehend the former as uniform antccedens and the latter as uniform consequens. Have we not the right, after the foregoing analysis, to inter- pret the uniform sequence of events solely as the necessary pre- supposition of the causal relation? Is it not at the same time the adequate presupposition ? Yes, is it not the causal relation itself? As we know, empiricism since Hume has answered the last question in the affirmative, and rationalism since Kant has answered it in the negative. We, too, have seemingly followed in our discussion the course of empiricism. At least, I find nothing in that discussion which a consistent empiricist might not be willing to concede; i. e., if he is ready to set aside the psychological investigation of the actual proc- esses which we here presuppose and make room for a critical anal- ysis of the content of the relation of cause and effect.' However, 1 The difference between the two points of view can be made clearer by an illus- tration. The case that we shall analyze is the dread of coming into contact with fire. The psychological analysis of this case has to make clear the mental content of the dread and its causes. Such dread becomes possible only when we are aware of the burning that results from contact with fire. We could have learned to be aware of this either immediately through our own experience, or mediately through the com- munication of others' experience. In both cases it is a matter of one or repeated ex- periences. In all cases the effects of earlier experiences equal association and recall,</page><page sequence="15">152 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIV. the decision of the question whether or not empiricism can de- termine exhaustively the content that we think in the causal rela- tion, depends upon other considerations than those which we have until now been called upon to undertake. We have so far which, in turn, result in recognition. The recognition explaining the case under dis- cussion arises thus. The present stimuli of visual perception arouse the retained im- pressions of previous visual perceptions of fire and give rise to the present perception (apperception) by fusing with them. By a process of interweaving, associations are joined to this perception. The apperceptively revived elements which lie at the basis of the content of the perception are interwoven by association with memory ele- ments that retain the additional contents of previous perceptions of fire, viz., the burning, or, again, are interwoven with the memory elements of the communications regarding such burning. By means of this interweaving, the stimulation of the apper- ceptive element transmits itself to the remaining elements of the association complex. The character of the association is different under different conditions. If it be founded only upon one experience, then there can arise a memory or a recall, in the wider sense, of the foregoing content of the perception and feeling at the time of the burn- ing, or, again, there can arise a revival wherein the stimulated elements of retention remain unconscious. Again, the words of the mother tongue that denote the previous mental content, and which likewise belong to the association complex (the apperceiv- ing mass, in the wider sense), can be excited in one of these three forms and in addi- tion as abstract verbal ideas. Each one of these forms of verbal discharge can lead to the innervations of the muscles involved in speech, which bring about some sort of oral expression of judgment. Each of these verbal reproductions can be connected with each of the foregoing sensory (sac/lichen) revivals. Secondly, if the association be founded upon repeated perceptions on the part of the person himself, then all the afore-mentioned possibilities of reproduction become more complicated, and, in addi- tion, the mental revivals contain, more or less, only the common elements of the previous perceptions, i. e., reappear in the form of abstract ideas or their correspond- ing unconscious modifications. In the third case the association is founded upon a communication of others' experience. For the sake of simplicity, let this case be con- fined to the following instance. The communication consisted in the assertion ' All fire will burn upon contact.' Moreover, this judgment was expressed upon occasion of imminent danger of burning. There can then arise, as is perhaps evident, all the possibilities mentioned in the second case, only that here there will be a stronger ten- dency toward verbal reproduction and the sensory reproduction will be less fixed. In the first two cases there was connected with the perception of the burning an intense feeling of pain. In the third the idea of such pain added itself to the vis- ual perception of the moment. The associated elements of the earlier mental con- tents belong likewise to the apperceiving mass excited at the moment, in fact to that part of it excited by means of association processes, or, as we can again say, depend- ing upon the point from which we take our view, the associative or apperceptive com- pletion of the content of present perception. If these pain elements are revived as memories, i. e., as elements in consciousness, they give rise to a new disagreeable feeling, which is referred to the possible coming sensation of burning. If the mental modifications corresponding to these pain elements remain unconscious, as is often</page><page sequence="16">No. 2.] COzTENT AND VALIDITY OF CA USAL LAW. IW53 only made clear what every critical analysis of the causal relation has to concede to empiricism. In reality the empiristic hypoth- esis is inadequate. To be sure, the proof of this inadequacy is not to be taken from the obvious argument which Reid possible, there arises none the less the same result as regards our feeling, only with less intensity. This feeling-tone we call the dread. As a result of the sum total of the revivals actual and possible, there is finally pro- duced, according to the particular circumstances, either a motor reaction or an inhibit- ant of such reaction. Both innervations can take place involuntarily or voluntarily. The critical analysis of the fact that we dread contact with fire, has another pur- pose and accordingly proceeds on other lines. It must make clear under what pre- suppositions the foresight that lies at the basis of such dread is valid for future experience. It must then formulate the actual process of revival that constitutes the foundation of this feeling as a series of judgments, from which the meaning and inter- connection of the several judgments will become clear. Thus the critical analysis must give a logical presentation of the apperceptive and associative processes of revival. For this purpose the three cases of the psychological analysis reduce themselves to two: viz., first, to the case in which an immediate experience forms the basis, and secondly, to that in which a variety of similar mediately or immediately communicated experiences form such basis. In the first of these logically differentiated cases, the transformation into the speech of formulated thought leads to the following inference from analogy: Fire A burned. Fire B is similar to fire A. Fire B will burn. In the second case there arises a syllogism of some such form as: All fire causes burning upon contact. This present phenomenon is fire. This present phenomenon will cause burning upon contact. Both premises of this syllogism are inductive inferences, whose implicit meaning be- comes clear when we formulate as follows: All heretofore investigated instances of fire have burned, therefore all fire burns. The present phenomenon manifests some properties of fire, will conse- quently have all the properties thereof. The present phenomenon will, in case of contact, cause burning. The first syllogism goes from the particular to the particular. The second proves itself to be (contrary to the analysis of Stuart Mill) an inference that leads from the general to the particular. For the conclusion is the particular of the second parts of the major and minor premises; and these second parts of the premises are inferred from their first parts in the two possible ways of inductive inference. The latter do not contain the case referred to in the conclusion, but set forth the conditions of carry- ing a result of previous experience over to a new case with inductive probability, in other words, the conditions of making past experience a means of foreseeing future experience.

XIV. raised against the empiricism of Hume, and which compelled Stuart Mill in his criticism of that attack 1 to abandon his empir- istic position at this point. No doubt the conclusion to which we also have come for the time being, goes much too far, the conclusion that the cause is nothing but the uniform antecedens and the effect merely the uniform consequent. Were it true, as we have hitherto assumed, that every uniformly preceding event is to be regarded as cause and every uniformly following event as effect, then day must be looked upon as cause of night and night as cause of day. Empiricism can, however, meet this objection without giving up its position; in fact, it can employ the objection as an argu- ment in its favor; for this objection affects only the manifestly imperfect formulation of the doctrine, not the essential arguments. It should have been pointed out again and again in the fore- going exposition, that only in the first indiscriminating view of things may we regard the events given us in perception as the basis of our concepts of cause and effect. All these events are intricately mixed, those that are given in self perception as well as those given in sense perception. The events of both groups flow along continuously. Consequently, as regards time, they permit a division into parts, which division proceeds, not indeed for our perception, but for our scientific thought, in short, conceptually, into infinity. The events of sense perception per- mit also conceptually of infinite division in their spatial relations. It is sufficient for our present purpose, if we turn our attention to the question of divisibility in time. This fact of divisibility shows that the events of our perception, which alone we have We remain within the bounds of logical analysis, if we state under what conditions conclusions follow necessarily from their premises, viz., the conclusions of arguments from analogy and of syllogisms in the narrower sense, as well as those of the fore- going inductive arguments. For the inference from analogy and the two forms of in- ductive inference, these conditions are the presuppositions already set forth in the text of the present paper, that in the as yet unobserved portion of reality the like causes will be found and they will give rise to like effects. For the syllogism they are the thought that the predicate of a predicate is the (mediate) predicate of the subject. Only the further analysis of these presuppositions, which is undertaken in the text, leads to critical considerations in the narrower sense. 'A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive, Bk.

We are therefore called upon to apportion the causal relations among the members of these systems. Only for the indiscriminating view of our practical Weltan- schauung is the perceived event a the cause of the perceived event b. The more exact analysis of our theoretical apprehen- sion of the world compels us to dissect the events a and b into the parts a,, ad a,, - b, by, and, where occasion calls for it, to continue the same process in turn for these and further com- ponents. We have accordingly to relate those parts to one another as causes and effects which, from the present standpoint of analysis, follow one another uniformly and immediately, viz., follow one another so that from this standpoint no other inter- vening event must be presupposed. In this way we come to have a well ordered experience. The dispositions to such experi- ence which reveal themselves within the field of practical thought, taught man long before the beginning of scientific methods not to connect causally day and night with one another, but the rising and setting of the sun with day and night. The theo- retical analysis, indeed, goes farther. It teaches that in what is here summed up as rising of the sun and yonder as day, there lie again intricate elements requiring special attention, in our own day extending perhaps to the lines of thought contained in the electro-dynamic theory of light and of electrons. Still the ways of thought remain the same on all the levels of penetrating analysis. We have throughout to relate to one another as cause and effect those events which, in a well ordered experience, must be re- garded as following one another immediately. The cause is then the iuimediate uniform antecedent, the effect the immediate uniform consequens. Otherwise stated, the perceived events that we are accustomed, from the standpoint of the practical Weltan- schauung, to regard as causes and effects, e. g., lightning and thunder, from the theoretical apprehension of the world prove to be infinitely involved collections of events, whose elements must be related to one another as causes and effects in as far as they can be regarded as following one another immedi- ately. No exception is formed by expressions of our rough way</page><page sequence="19">156 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIV. of viewing and describing which lead us without hesitation to regard as cause one out of the very many causes of an event, and this, too, not necessarily the immediate uniformly preceding event. All this lies rather in the nature of such a hasty view. The present limitation of uniform sequence to cases of irnme- diate sequence, sets aside then the objection from which we started, in that it adopts as its own the essential point in question. Moreover, the way that leads us to this necessary limitation goes farther: it leads to a strengthening of the empiristic position. It brings us to a point where we see that the most advanced analysis of intricate systems of events immediately given to us in perception as real, nowhere reveals more than the simple fact of uniform sequence. Again, where we come to regard the in- tervals between the events that follow one another immediately as very short, there the uniformity of the time relation makes, it would seem, the events for us merely causes and effects; and, as often as we have occasion to proceed to the smaller time differ' ences of a higher order, the same process repeats itself; for we dissect the events that make up our point of departure into ever more complex systems of component events, and the coarser relations of uniform sequence into ever finer immediate ones. Nowhere, seemingly, do we get beyond the field of events in uniform sequence, which finally have their foundation in the facts of perception from which they are drawn. Thus there follows from this conceptual refinement of the point of departure only the truth that nothing connects the events as causes and effects except the immediate uniformity of sequence. Nonetheless, we have to think the empiristic doctrine to the bottom, if we desire to determine whether or not the hypothesis which it offers is really sufficient to enable us to deduce the causal relation. For this purpose let us remind ourselves that the question at issue is, whether or not this relation is merely a temporal con- nection of events that are given to us in perception or that can be derived from the data of perception. Besides, let us grant that this relation is as thoroughly valid for the content of our experience as empiricism has always, and</page><page sequence="20">No. 2.] CONTENTAND VALIDITY OF CA USAL LAW. I57 rationalism nearly always, maintained. We presuppose, therefore, as granted, that every event is to be regarded as cause, and hence, in the opposite time relation, as effect, mental events that are given to us in self perception no less than the physical whose source is our sense perception. In other words, we assume that the totality of events in our possible experience presents a closed system of causal series, i. e., that every member within each of the contemporary series is connected with the subsequent ones, as well as with the subsequent members of all the other series, backward and forward as cause and effect; and therefore, finally, that every member of every series stands in causal rela- tionship with every member of every other series. We do not then, for the present purpose, burden ourselves with the hypothe- sis which was touched upon above, that this connection is to be thought of as a continuous one, viz., that other members can be inserted ad infinitum between any two members of the series. We maintain at the same time that there is no justification for separating from one another the concepts, causality and inter- action. This separation is only to be justified through the meta- physical hypothesis that reality consists in a multitude of inde- pendently existing substances inherently subject to change, and that their mutual interconnection is conditioned by a common dependence upon a first infinite cause.' Every connection be- tween cause and effect is mutual, if we assume with Newton that to every action there is an equal opposing reaction. In that we bring the totality of knowable reality, as far as it is analyzable into events, under the causal relation, we may regard the statement that every event requires us to seek among uni- formly preceding events for the sufficient causes of its own reality, viz., the general causal law, as the principle of all material sciences. For all individual instances of conformity to law which we can discover in the course of experience, are from this point of view only special cases of the general universal conformity to law which we have just formulated. ' This doctrine began in the theological evolution of the Christian concept of God. It was first fundamentally formulated by Leibniz. It is retained in Kant's doctrine of the harmonia generaliter stabilita and the latter's consequences for the critical doctrine of the mundus intelligibilis. Hence it permeates the metaphysical doctrines of the systems of the nineteenth century in various ways.</page><page sequence="21">158 THE P[HLOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIV. For the empiristic interpretation, the (general) causal law is only the highest genus of the individual cases of empirically synthetic relations of uniform sequence. Starting from these presuppositions, it cannot be other than a generalization from experience, i. e., a carrying over of observed relations of uniform, or, as we may now also say, constant sequence to those which have not been or cannot be objects of observation, as well as to those which we expect to appear in the future. Psychologically regarded, it is merely the most general expression of an expec- tation, conditioned through associative reproduction, of uniform sequence. It is, therefore, - to bring Hume's doctrine to a con- clusion that the father of modern empiricism himself did not draw, - a species of temporal contiguity. The general validity which we ascribe to the causal law is ac- cordingly a merely empirical one. It can never attain apodeic- tic or even assertorical validity, but purely that type of proble- matic validity which we may call ' real' in contradistinction to the other type of problematic validity attained in judgments of objective as well as of subjective and hypothetical possibility.1 No possible progress of experience can win for the empiristically interpreted causal law any other than this real problematic valid- ity; for experience can never become complete a parte post, nor has it ever been complete a parts ante. The causal law is valid assertorically only, in so far as it sums up, purely in the way of an inventory, the preceding experiences. We call such as- sumptions, drawn from well-ordered experience and of inductive origin, ' hypotheses,' whether they rest upon generalizing inductive inferences in the narrower sense, or upon specializing inferences from analogy. They, and at the same time the empiristically interpreted causal law, are not hypotheses in the sense ill which Newton rightly rejected all formation of hypotheses,2 but are such as are necessarily part of all methods in the sciences of 1 Cf. the author's Logik, Bd. I, Q 6I. 2 " Rationem vero harum gravitates proprietatum ex phmenomenis nondum potui de- ducere, et hypotheses non fingo.

The assertion of Stuart Mill, in opposition to this conclusion, that the cause must be thought of as the " invariable antecedent " and, correspondingly, the effect as the "invariable consequent,"1 does all honor to the genius of the thinker; but it agrees by no means with the empiristic presuppositions which serve as the basis for his conclusions. For, starting from these presupposi- tions, the " invariable sequence " can only mean one that is uni- form and constant according to past experience, and that we henceforth carry over to not yet observed events as far as these prove in conformity with it, and in this way verify the anticipation contained in our general assertion. The same holds of the asser- tion through which Mill endeavors to meet the above-mentioned objection of Reid, viz., that the unchanging sequence must at the same time be demonstrably an " unconditional " one. The lan- guage in which experience speaks to us knows the term 'the unconditioned' as little as the term 'the unchangeable,' even though this have, as Mill explains, the meaning that the effect "will be, whatever supposition we may make in regard to all other things," or that the sequence will " be subject to no other than negative conditions." For in these determinations there does not lie exclusively, according to Mill, a probable prediction of the future. " It is necessary to our using the word cause, that we should believe not only that the antecedent always has been followed by the consequent, but that as long as the present con- stitution of things endures, it always will be so." Likewise, Mill, the man of research, not the empiristic logician, asserts that there belongs to the causal law, besides this generality referring to all possible events of uniform sequence, also an " undoubted assurance "; although he could have here referred to a casual remark of Hume.2 Such an undoubted assurance, " that for ' Logic, Bk. III, ch. v, Q 2. 2 Ibid, Q 6 and at the end of Q 2. Hume says in a note to Section VI of his En- quiry concerning Human Understanding.- "We ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs, and probabilities. By proofs meaning such arguments from ex- perience as leave no room for doubt or opposition." The note stands in evident con- trast to the well-known remarks at the beginning of Section IV, pt. i;</page><page sequence="23">i6o THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIV. every event . .. there is a law to be found, if we only know where to find it," evidently does not know of a knowledge re- ferred exclusively to experience. Hence, if the causal law is, as empiricism to be consistent must maintain, only a general hypothesis which is necessarily subject to verification as experience progresses, then it is not impossible that in the course of experience events will appear that are not preceded or followed uniformly by others, and that accordingly cannot be regarded as causes or effects. According to this interpretation of the causal law, such exceptional events, whether in individual or in repeated cases of perception, must be just as possible as those which in the course of preceding ex- perience have proved themselves to be members of series of con- stant sequence. On the basis of previous experience, we should only have the right to say that such exceptional cases are less probable; and we might from the same ground expect that, if they could be surely determined, they would only have to be regarded as exceptions to the rule and not, possibly, as signs of a misunderstood universal non-uniformity of occurrence. No one wants to maintain an empirical necessity, i. e., a statement that so comprehends a present experience or an hypothesis de- veloped on the basis of present experience that its contradictory is rationally impossible. An event preceded by no other im- mediately and uniformly as cause, would, according to traditional usage, arise out of nothing. An event that was followed im- mediately and constantly by no other, would accordingly be an event that remained without effect, and, did it pass away, it must disappear into nothing. The old thought, well known in its scholastic formulation, ex ni/ilo nihil fit, in ni/lilum nihil potest reverti, is only another expression for the causal law as we have interpreted it above. The contradictories to each of the clauses of the thought just formulated, that something can arise out of nothing and pass into nothing, remain therefore, as a conse- quence of empiricism, an improbable thought, to be sure, but none the less a thought to which a real possibility must be ascribed. It was in all probability this that Stuart Mill wished to convey</page><page sequence="24">No. 2.] CONTENT AND VALIDITY OF CAUSAL LAW. I6i in the much debated passage: "I am convinced that any one accustomed to abstraction and analysis, who will fairly exert his faculties for the purpose, will, when his imagination has once learnt to entertain the notion, find no difficulty in conceiving that in some one, for instance, of the many firmaments into which side- real astronomy now divides the universe, events may succeed one another at random without any fixed law; nor can anything in our experience, or in our mental nature, constitute a sufficient, or indeed any, reason for believing that this is nowhere the case." For Mill immediately calls our attention to the follow- ing: " Were we to suppose (what it is perfectly possible to imagine) that the present order of the universe were brought to an end, and that a chaos succeeded in which there was no fixed succession of events, and the past gave no assurance of the future; if a human being were miraculously kept alive to witness this change, he surely would soon cease to believe in any uni- formity, the uniformity itself no longer existing." 1 We can throw light from another side upon the thought that lies in this outcome of the empiristic interpretation of the causal law. If we still desire to give the name ' effect' to an event that is preceded uniformly by no other, and that we therefore have to regard as arising out of nothing, then we must say that it is the effect of itself, i. e., its cause lies in its own reality, in short, that it is casa sui. Therefore the assumption that a causa sui has just as much real possibility as have the causes of our experience which are followed uniformly by another event, is a necessary consequence of the empiristic view of causation. This much only remains sure, there is nothing contained in our previous ex- perience that in any way assures us of the validity of this pos- sible theory. The empiristic doctrine of causation requires, however, still further conclusions. Our scientific, no less than our practical thought has always been accustomed to regard the relation be- tween cause and effect not as a matter of mere sequence, not therefore as a mere formal temporal one. Rather it has always, in both forms of our thought, stood for a real relation, i. e., for 'logic, Bk. III, ch. xxi, 1.</page><page sequence="25">i62 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIV. a relation of dynamic dependence of effect upon cause. Accord-. ingly, the effect arises out of the cause, is engendered through it, or brought forth by it. The historical development of this dynamic conception of cause is well known. The old anthropopathic interpretation, which interpolates anthropomorphic and yet superhuman intervention between the events that follow one another uniformly, has main- tained itself on into the modern metaphysical hypotheses. It remains standing wherever God is assumed as the first cause for the interaction between parts of reality. It is made obscure, but not eliminated, when, in other conceptions of the world, imper- sonal nature, fate, necessity, the absolute identity, or an abstrac- tion related to these, appears in the place of God. On the other hand, it comes out clearly wherever these two tenden- cies of thought unite themselves in an anthropopathic pan- theism. That is, it rests only upon a difference in strength between the governing religious and scientific interests, whether or not the All-One which unfolds itself in the interconnection and content of reality is thought of more as the immanent God, or more as substance. Finally, we do not change our position, if the absolute, self-active being (in all these theories a first cause is presupposed as causa sui) is degraded to a non-intel- lectual will. However, the dynamic interpretation of cause has not remained confined to the field of these general speculations, just because it commanded that field so early. There is a second branch, likewise early evolved from the stem of the anthropopathic inter- pretation, the doctrine that the causal relations of dependence are effected through ' forces.' These forces adhere to, or dwell in, the ultimate physical elements which are thought of as masses. Again, as spiritual forces they belong to the ' soul,' which in turn is thought of as a substance. In the modern contrast between attractive and repulsive forces, there lies a remnant of the Em- pedokllean opposition between Love and Hate. In the various old and new hylozoistic tendencies, the concepts of force and its correlate, mass, are eclectically united. In consistent materialism as well as spiritualism, and in the abstract dynamism of energetics,</page><page sequence="26">No. 2.] CONTENT AND VALIDITY OF CAUSAL LAW. i63 the one member is robbed of its independence or even rejected in favor of the other. 1 It is evident in what light all these dynamic conceptions appear, when looked at from the standpoint of consistent extreme empiri- cism. These ' forces,' to consider here only this one of the dynamic hypotheses, help to explain nothing. The physical forces, or those which give rise to movement, are evidently not given to us as contents of sense perception, and at the most they can be deduced as non-sensuous foundations, not as contents of possible sense perception. The often and variously expressed belief that self perception reveals to us here what our senses leave hidden, has proved itself to be in all its forms a delusion. The forces whose existence we assume have then an intuitable con- tent only in as far as they get it through the uniformities present in repeated perceptions, which uniformities are to be ' explained' through them. But right here their assumption proves itself to be not only superfluous but even misleading; for it makes us believe that we have offered an explanation, whereas in reality we have simply duplicated the given by means of a fiction, quite after the fashion of the Platonic doctrine of Ideas. This endeavor to give the formal temporal relations between events, which we interpret as causes and effects, a dynamic real substructure, shows itself thus to be worthless in its contributions to our thought. The same holds true of every other dynamic hypothesis. The critique called forth by these contributions establishes therefore only the validity of the empiristic interpretation. If, however, we have once come so far, we may not hold our- selves back from the final step. Empiricism has long ago taken this step, and the most consistent among its modern German rep- resentatives has aroused anew the impulses that make it neces- sary. Indeed, if we start from the empiristic presuppositions, we must recognize that there lies not only in the assumption of forces, but even in the habit of speaking of causes and effects, " a clear 1 Alongside of these dynamic theories, there are to be found mechanical ones that arose just as early and from the same source, viz., the practical Weltanschauung. It is not part of our purpose to discuss them. Their first scientific expression is to be found in the doctrine of effluences and pores in Empedokles and in Atomism.</page><page sequence="27">i64 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIV. trace of fetishism." We are not then surprised when the state- ment is made: The natural science of the future, and accordingly science in general, will, it is to be hoped, set aside these concepts also on account of their formal obscurity. For, so it is explained, repetitions of like cases in which a is always connected with b, viz., in which like results are found under like circumstances, in short, the essence of the connection of cause and effect, exists only in the abstraction that is necessary to enable us to repicture the facts. In nature itself there are no causes and effects. Die Natur ist nur einmal da. It is, again, Stuart Mill the man of research, not the empiricist, that opposes this conclusion, and indeed opposes it in the form that Auguste Comte had given it in connection with thoughts that can be read into Hume's doctrine. Comte's " objection to the word cause is a mere matter of nomenclature, in which, as a matter of nomenclature, I consider him to be entirely wrong. . . . By re- jecting this form of expression, M. Comte leaves himself without any term for marking a distinction which, however incorrectly expressed, is not only real, but is one of the fundamental dis- tinctions in science." 1 For my own part, the right seems to be on the side of Comte and his recent followers in showing the old nomenclature to be worn out, if viewed from the standpoint of empiricism. If the re- lation between cause and effect consists alone in the uniformity of sequence which is hypothetically warranted by experience, then it can be only misleading to employ words for the members of this purely formal relation that necessarily have a strong tang of real dynamic dependence. In fact, they give the connection in question a peculiarity that, according to consistent empiricism, it does not possess. The question at issue in the empiristically interpreted causal relation is a formal functional one, which is not essentially different, as Ernst Mach incidentally acknowledges, from the interdependence of the sides and angles of a triangle. Here two extremes meet. Spinoza, the most consistent of the dogmatic rationalists, finds himself compelled in his formulation of the analytic interpretation of the causal relation handed down 1 Logic, Bk. III, ch. v, { 6.</page><page sequence="28">No. 2.] CONTENT AND VALIDITY OF CAUSAL LAW. i65 to him to transform it into a mathematical one. Mach, the most consistent of recent German empiricists, finds himself compelled to recognize that the empirically synthetic relation between cause and effect includes no other form of dependence than that which is present in the functional mathematical relations. (In Germany empiricism steeped in natural science has supplanted the naive materialism saturated with natural science.) That the mathe- matical relations must likewise be subjected to a purely empirical interpretation, which even Hume denied them, is a matter of course. However, this agreement of two opposing views is no proof that empiricism is on the right road. The empiristic conclusions to which we have given our attention, do not succeed in defining adequately the specific nature of the causal relation; on the con- trary, they compel us to deny such a relation. Thus they cast aside the concept that we have endeavored to define, i. e., the judgment in which we have to comprehend whatever is peculiar to the causal connection. But one does not untie a knot by deny- ing that it exists. [To be concluded.] BENNO ERDMANN. BONN UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
