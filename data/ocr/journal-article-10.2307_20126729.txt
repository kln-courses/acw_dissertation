OLAFSON Individuation and Non-Identity: A New Look, HECTOR-NERI CASTA?EDA This paper establishes that the classical problem of individuation is a mixture of two different ontological problems: (1) individuation, i.e., what constitutes the individuality of an individual, and (2) differentiation, i.e., what accounts for the difference among individuals. The principles of the indiscernibility of identicals and of the identity of indiscernibles have to do with (2), not with (1). The paper discusses seven criteria proposed by an adequate theory of individuation that the individuator has to meet. It turns out that the individuator is common to all individuals, but is not a property ; it itself is not an individual, whether bare or other wise. The paper adumbrates a theory of individuation, which is fully presented in combination with suitable theories of predication, existence, and identity, in the author's "Thinking and the Structure of the World," Philosophia 4 (1974), pp. 3-40. Happiness, ROBERT W. SIMPSON Happiness has often been held to consist either in the satisfaction of desire or in pleasure. In criticizing these accounts two distinctions are drawn: first, between "will" and "desire," where the former involves the thought of the goodness of the object wanted while the latter involves no such thought, desire having its origin, for example, in physiological causes ; * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of The Review.

And it is argued that engaging in activities one finds satisfy ing and getting what one wills is necessary for happiness. The question is then raised whether it is sufficient for happiness that one gets and does what seems to one to be good or whether only what really is good leads to happiness. Some considerations are presented to show that the latter is the case. The Divine Attributes, WILLIAM E. MANN The concept of God as the greatest conceivable being would be a logically incoherent concept if any one of the degreed properties which contribute essentially to God's greatness has no intrinsic maximum. I argue that three of the divine attributes?omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence?are the intrinsic maxima of the degreed properties of being knowledgeable, being powerful, and being benevolent, respectively. For these three attributes at least, then, the concept of God is not incoher ent by virtue of one of the attribute's not having an intrinsic maximum. The concept of omnibenevolence is the most difficult to assess. In order to define it, I introduce the notion of one possible world being a Bruno improvement over another. Finally I discuss some of the implications of my definitions of the concept of omnibenevolence. Propositional Commitment and Presuppositions, RUTH MANOR Given a speaker S who performs an ordered set of speech-acts in a context C, we determine to what possible propositions S committed himself by his speech. At each step of the speech, S performs a speech-act which, via the context, is translated into a set of sentences in the formal language CAP. The relative context of the speech at this stage provides us with a set of CAV interpretations, which determine the possible propositions S is committed to so far. We distinguish pragmatical presuppositions (following Belnap), which are dependent on the CAV sentences expressed, and contex tual presuppositions (following Stalnaker) which also depend on the speech act performed in expressing that sentence. The speech is logically termi nated when S expresses a sentence A, if A pragmatically presupposes B which is inconsistent with S's previous commitments or if A is inconsistent with the context of the speech. Else, the speech ends when the speaker stops expressing CAV sentences by his speech-acts. In particular, expressing A, which is inconsistent with S's previous commitments, may be considered a "change of mind" and not cause the logical termination of the speech. Permissions and Supererogation, JOSEPH RAZ A critical examination of various ways of drawing a distinction be tween "strong" and "weak" permissions leads to an elucidation of one</page><page sequence="3">770 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS type of permission : a permission not to do what one ought to do. Belief that some acts are supererogatory is based on belief in the validity of such permissions since it assumes that there are acts which ought to be done and yet it is not wrong not to perform them. Is Hume Really a Skeptic about Induction?, TOM L. BEAUCHAMP and THOMAS A. MAPPES Hume's expositors and critics have unwittingly collaborated to pre sent a mistaken account of his views on the problems of induction and of rationally supporting beliefs. In general, they claim that Hume is a com plete inductive skeptic. We argue that this claim is groundless. The re ceived view of Hume's positions on inductive justifications and on the rationality of inductive procedures seems to rest on one, or both, of two mistaken reconstructions of Hume's arguments. One reconstruction is based on the mistaken premise that Hume thinks "The entire institution of inductive reasoning cannot be rationally justified." The other recon struction is based on the equally mistaken premise that Hume thinks "All factual beliefs are based solely on instinct and not on justifying reasons. ' ' We argue that each of these interpretations incorrectly depicts Hume's views and that both of these errors lead to the myth that Hume is skeptical about induction. We also show that Hume is only a skeptic about the rationalists' account of factual reasoning, not about factual reasoning in general. And finally we show that even though Hume does not skeptically challenge the institution of induction, he could have consistently raised a skeptical challenge and resolved it. The Essential Nature of Art, E. J. BOND All attempts to give an account of art's essential nature by listing the properties that make an object a work of art have failed. That is be cause we have been looking for the essence of art in the wrong place. Art is a genus, and its species are the various art forms: literature, music, painting, etc. If we want to know what art is, therefore, we must look to see what it is that makes undoubted art forms of art. A work of art will then be any product of an undoubted art form. Seven criteria are given such that if a form satisfies all seven it is an undoubted art form, and if it fails to satisfy one or more its status is borderline or debatable. AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 53, No. 1, May 1975 Similarity, Continuity and Survival, BRUCE LANGTRY Might a continuant go out of existence at a certain time and come into existence at some later time? Many have denied it. It has been</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 771 argued that mere relations of qualitative similarity could not guarantee the identity of the object which goes out of existence with the object that subsequently came into existence. For either identity would collapse into similarity, or the assertion of the former over and above that latter would be quite groundless. Problems arise concerning duplication: identity is a one-one relation, whereas similarity is not. Moreover, the preservation of spatio-temporal continuity is required to exclude the very possibility of setting the earlier and later objects side by side. In this article I defend an affirmative answer to the original question, largely by attacking these and other arguments for a negative answer. Egoism and Consistency, COLIN DA VIE S I discuss three recent attempts?by R. M. Hare, A. Gewirth and R. S. Peters?to defend morality against the claims of egoism. I contend that, in each case, the concept of egoism employed begs the question at issue. That is, they are arguments which can only be properly directed against one who, inconsistently, combines egoism with an assumption that other people matter morally, and who poses, therefore, no threat to morality. Tense and Temporally Neutral Paraphrase, ROBERT P. McARTHUR Sensations and Understanding, G. A. MALINAS My concern in this paper is with sensory qualities and the role percep tion of them plays in our understanding of the terms denoting them. The particular question the paper addresses is: What contribution(s), if any, does having red sensations make to one's understanding the meaning of the term 'red'? I examine two simple answers to this question: everything and nothing. I argue that both simple answers are wrong and propose a more plausible answer. The Presumption of Equality, D. E. BROWNE The presumption principle claims that there is an onus of justification on whomever would treat people unequally. It is to be distinguished from the Aristotelian formula of justice ("Equals are to be treated equally, unequals unequally"), which does not yield any presumption, and from a species of egalitarian belief which does yield a presumption in favor of equality, but which is itself unreasonable. The argument for regarding the presumption principle as a conceptual truth, a constitutive rule of practical reasoning, is reconstructed and shown to be question-begging. Reason is found for doubting that the presumption principle is either an a priori truth, or a useful practical maxim.</page><page sequence="5">772 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. XV, No. 1, March 1975 Objective Knowledge and Objective Value, ERROL E. HARRIS Knowledge and objective truth are necessarily connected terms. The ideal of objectivity in knowledge is continuous in philosophy and science from the Greeks to the present day. But it has recently been called in question from diverse sources : (1) the contemporary philosophers of science who base their theories on historical evidence (e.g. Kuhn, Hanson, Feyera bend) ; (2) Phenomenologists following Husserl and Heidegger and the more recent exponents of hermeneutics ; (3) critics of contemporary science who point to the insolubility of the socio-political predicament by means of scientific and technological devisai. The result is a general relativism both in epistemology and in value theory (the latter stemming originally from the search for objectivity in value-free conceptions of a mechanistic world). This relativism is intrinsically self-refuting, but it is not warranted by the contemporary outlook in science or the epistemological theory that can be developed from it. The former is throughout, and despite overt disclaimers, holistic and points to a conception of "objectivity" which re verses the current view derivative from the seventeenth century and pro vides an acceptable basis for the establishment of objective standards both in science and in value. Mythic World as World, JAMES G. HART Whither Evolution? Some Questions to Teilhard De Chard/in, GERALD PENN ANTHONY Teilhard envisions llone evolution," "from the abyss of the past to the abyss of the future." Within Duration, Consciousness individuates, from the "granulation" of physical matter to the heights of super-personal isation. "The stuff of the universe is spirit-matter," which sequentially super-personalises through successively rising consciousness-intensive "wholes." I submit that sequential phenomenality is Consciousness in its limited functioning as physical matter, and functions with those limitations wherever a "whole" has a physical component in its integral complexity. It is not legitimate to extrapolate a space-time context, with its peculiarly limiting imperatives, to embrace levels of Consciousness-function wherein space-time is irrelevant to such functioning; as, for example, in Psi phenomena, and in the mystic experience of ' ' One-ness?Now. ' ' Sequential phenomenality is merely a mode of Consciousness in its physical octaves: its characteristics cannot be extrapolated to interpret the wholeness of Consciousness itself.</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 773 Two Options in Modern Social Theory : Whitehead and Habermas, WILLIAM M. SULLIVAN Increasing criticism of the positivistic ideal of a value-free social science has led to renewed demands for social theory focused by value con cerns. This essay analyzes two important modern traditions in social theory that emphasize human well-being as a regulative value and yet are not simply utilitarian. These are the Frankurt School's Critical Theory developed by J?rgen Habermas and A. N. Whitehead's cosmological statement of the American Pragmatist tradition. Habermas' theory is analyzed as a Transcendental theory defining man in terms of a his torically developed interest structure. The key problem of humanization for this theory, "reification," is compared to "abstraction" as the major human problem for Whitehead. The effort to give an account of their respective critical, evaluative claims leads both theories to confront the problem of ontology and the question of the limits of reason. Confucianism: A Critical Re-assessment of the Heritage, JULIA CHING This article represents an effort to make a serious and critical re appraisal of the Confucian tradition in the wake of the recent anti Confucius campaign in China, September 1973 to August 1974. It presents, in synopsis, all the major critiques of Confucianism throughout history: the Early Critiques (Mohism, Taoism, Legalism) ; the Modern Critiques, with their expression of desire for intellectual pluralism against the past Confucian dogmatism, especially from 1916 on, which aroused enough academic interest to encourage a "Quest for the Historical Confucius," a quest just as difficult of achievement as that for the historical Jesus; the Chinese Marxist Critiques, first from 1950's to early 1960 's, when the debate was over a question of methodology, concentrating upon analyses of such problems as that of the meaning of Jen, the Confucian virtue; the well-known anti-Confucius campaign, from 1966 to 1974; and finally, the Western Critiques, including both criticisms voiced by missionaries and philosophers. This long survey of critiques leads in conclusion to a "Critique of the Critiques," which offers a discussion of Confucian values, the valid and the obsolete, and the question of the survival of Confucianism in the future. THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. LXXI, No. 17, October 10, 1974 Reference and Ontology, DALE GOTTLIEB Ontological commitment results from the choice of logical form and referential semantics. Since there are alternatives to the latter, e.g. sub</page><page sequence="7">774 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS stitutional semantics, which are equally adequate for logic and a truth definition, we can escape ontological commitments without abandoning useful logical form. Recent objections to substitutional semantics by Par sons, Quine, and Wallace are answered, and a brief account is given of the need for determinate identity conditions as a pre-requisite for reference. Is Marxism a Philosophy, DEREK P. ALLEN Against a recent interpretation of Marx's Critique of Justice I make two points. (1) Marx argues that capitalist practice appears to conform to the capitalist principle of distributive justice but in reality does not. Nor can it, because the practice prescribed by the principle is incompatible with capitalism. To reveal the conflict between social appearance and social reality is a task for what Marx in 1843 calls "philosophy" but later calls (empirical) "science." (2) Marx judges the capitalist principle of distributive justice to be defective in comparison to the communist. But it might be objected that he cannot do so consistently with his account of juridical principles. I argue that Marx could avoid this difficulty by appealing to the principle of utility. Vol. LXXI, No. 18, October 24, 1974 Molyneaux's Problem, JUDITH JARVIS THOMSON Ethics of Guilt, WILLIAM NEBLETT In my essay on "The Ethics of Guilt" I am concerned to describe some of the ethical attitudes surrounding the feeling of guilt, along with the relation between feeling guilty and redemption, between feeling guilty and forgiving oneself. I discuss what I entitle "The Radical View of Guilt," in which feeling guilt is viewed pejoratively. I attempt to high light the good sense in this view while yet reaffirming some of the more customary attitudes towards the feeling of guilt which, for the most part, portray guilt as a morally good feeling, not to be disassociated from other morally good feelings such as the feelings of sympathy and concern for others. I also try to indicate how the subject of guilt and redemption can only be fully elucidated if it is, at least to some degree, conceived to fall within the rubric of self-regarding morality. Kripke on the Identity Theory, FRED FELDMAN</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 775 Kripke and the Materialist, WILLIAM G. LYCAN It is argued that Saul Kripke's recent attack on the Identity Theory of Mind (in "Naming and Necessity" and in "Identity and Necessity") begs the question against the main proponents of that Theory, in that it rests on the undefended denials of two theses, each of which has an tecedently been espoused and supported by those Identity Theorists. In the concluding section of the paper, the impact of Kripke's argument upon other current forms of materialism is examined. Vol. LXXI, No. 19, November 7, 1974 Foundationalism, Coherentism, and the Idea of Cognitive Systematization, NICHOLAS RESCHER Modes of Polysemy, GARETH B. MATTHEWS Whewell's Elements of Morality, ALAN DONAGAN Quine with Cod, JOHN F. POST Vol. LXXI, No. 20, November 21, 1974 An Argument for Descriptivism, MARRY FORRESTER The author argues for the truth of descriptivism?the view that evaluations are statements which are either true or false. If evaluations are imperatives or performatives, and not descriptors, she maintains, certain arguments in which evaluations appear, and which are generally accepted as valid, would not be valid. She then argues that descriptions, and only descriptions, can be used in such arguments. If so, since evalua tions can be so used, evaluations are descriptions. For example: "If I promise to go, he will go;" "I promise to go;" "Therefore, he will go." The antecendent of the first premise describes the condition that I make the promise to go, whereas the second premise is a non-descriptive perform ative. Only if the second premise describes the fulfillment of this con dition, is the argument valid. If "I promise to go" is replaced by an evaluation, the argument is valid, however.</page><page sequence="9">776 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS A Dilemma for Nondescriptivism, B. L. BLOSE The argument is (a) that to be philosophically interesting, non descriptivist ethical theories must, at the least, maintain that moral utter ances necessarily perform some illocutionary acts distinct from the like of describing S to be P, or stating that S is P, or giving the information that S is P: and (b) that so understood, nondescriptivism admits of an utterly conclusive refutation. The refutation is in the form of a simple constructive dilemma concerning the negative generalization (labeled "NO") that no matter what combination of purely descriptive predicates "X and Y and ..." is contrived, the utterance "This, which is X and Y and . . . , is not good" will never be self-annulling. It is shown that if NG is false, nondescriptivism must be mistaken; that if NG is true, it must also be mistaken; and therefore that nondescriptivism is inevitably mis taken. Review of David Lyons' In The Interest of the Governed, ROLF SARTORIUS Vol. LXXI, No. 21, December 5, 1974 Review of A. Isenberg's The Theory of Criticism, CHARLES STEVENSON Empiricism and the Possibility of Encountering Intelligent Beings with Different Sense-Structures, NEAL GROSSMAN According to the traditional theory/observation distisction, a theory is "justified" by its observation statements, which themselves do not re quire justification over and above simple observation. In this paper I con sider an example in terms of which it makes sense to ask for a "justifica tion" of an observation statement. I argue that the theory as a whole can serve as "evidence" for an observation statement, and that the observation statements themselves perhaps belong more to the context of discovery than has hitherto been suspected. At any rate, the upshot is to further blur both the observation/theory distinction and the discover/justification distinction. Vol. LXXI, No. 22, December 19, 1974 In Defense of the Coherence Theory of Truth, FRANCIS DAUER Quine's notion of observationality and Wittgenstein's idea of agree ment in judgments are shown to be helpful in defending the theory held</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 777 by Bradley, Neurath, and others according to which the truth of a state ment consists in its coherence with other statements. An essential char acterization of truth in terms of coherence is specified and defended against the challege: Regardless of how well the statement of a system cohere with one another, couldn't the whole lot be false? Vol. LXXI I, No. 1, January 16, 1975 Because He Thought He Had Insulted Him, ADAM MORTAN I develop analyses of quantification into several kinds of psychological contexts, and argue that such quantification serves a function which, given the way we take people to operate, is essential to many kinds of psycholog ical explanation. A Note on Translation, A. THOMAS TYMOCZKO After observing that several common definitions of translation are inadequate for philosophical purposes, the author suggests defining a translation between natural languages, Lx and L2, as a pair of functions, / and g, such that f(g) maps all sentences of Lx(L2) into those of L2(L?). An important consequence of this definition is that the retranslation of a sentence S of Lly i.e., g(f(S)), is generally distinct from the original sentence S. For this reason we can measure, to an extent, the adequacy of a translation?from within one of the languages translated?by examining the relation between sentences and their retranslations. Three measures suggested are: agreement of a sentence and its retranslation in truth value, logical equivalence, and likeness in meaning. Applying these measures is a practical matter. They are employed in the process of translating and also in obtaining information about linguistic structure. On these grounds, the author concludes that the suggested definition of translation, while incomplete, merits further consideration. Vol. LXXI I, No. 2, January 30, 1975 Review of three books by Cavell: Must We Mean What We Say?/ The World Viewed : Reflections on the Ontology of Film; and The Senses of Waiden, MARY MOTHERSILL Review of Mikel Dufrenne's The Phenomenology of Aesthetic Experience, MARCIA C. AUFHAUSER</page><page sequence="11">778 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Vol. LXXI I, No. 3, February 13, 1975 Will and Reason in Descartes' Theory of Error, HIRAM CATON It is generally believed that the theory of judgment of the Fourth Meditation marks a significant departure from Descartes' earlier views, especially as expressed in the Regulae. This difference has been related to the general problem of the "turn" in Descartes' thought from the self sufficiency of the method in the early years to recognition of a need to found the sciences upon a veracious God: the confident rationalism of the methodological period is replaced by the more precarious doctrine that the will judges of truth and falsity. The present essay argues that the theory of error of the Meditations is part of Descartes' ad hominem use of scholastic theology. The real meaning of his theory is that all sin is ignorance, or that virtue is knowl edge. It is shown that this thesis plays an important role in Descartes' emancipation of reason from theological tutelage. It is further argued that beneath this scholastic surface there is continuity with the teaching of the Regulae, which supports the author's thesis that Cartesian philosophy has but one "foundation." Finally, it is shown that Descartes' actual theory of judgement is taken from the Stoics, and not borrowed from scholasticism. Vol. LXXI I, No. 4, February 27, 1975 Will, Hope, and the Noumenon, ERIC ROMAN The first of this two-chapter essay (part of a larger work on hope) analyzes the interconnection of hope and will. A critique of Fichte 's and Schopenhauer's metaphysical treatment of will shows their thesis that will is Absolute to be untenable: the Absolute precludes contingency yet willing without contingency is a logical contradiction. Nor is will ab solute (i.e. in the phenomenal world), because it must be activated by a purposive agent : hope. The second chapter relates man's hope to the noumenal cosmos. God as an object of hope has failed man because He uneasily hovers between the phenomenal and the noumenal. Authentic cosmic hope is possible only in the context of creative evolution through which man surpasses himself by being absorbed in a higher cosmic consciousness. Fear of the noumenon is reduced by gradually uniting man with the object of his terror. JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. XIII, No. 1, January 1975 The Stoic Oikeiosis and Sartre's 'Situation', PHILLIP MERLAN</page><page sequence="12">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 779 The Infinite Sphere: Comments on the History of a Metaphor, KARSTEN HARRIES Alexandre Koyr? speaks of Nicolaus Cusanus' "astonishing trans ference to the universe of the pseudo-Hermetic characterization of God, 'a sphere of which the center is everywhere and the circumference no where.' " The article tries to show that, far from being astonishing, this transference is suggested by the metaphor itself. The metaphor of the infinite sphere presupposes an understanding of God and of man which had to lead men beyond the medieval cosmos. A deep historical and sys tematic connection links medieval mysticism to the new cosmology. Unless this connection is recognized, the work of a thinker like Cusanus will seem a curious hybrid of still medieval theological discussions and some very modern epistemological and cosmological speculations. This, however, is a false dichotomy: in Cusanus' writings the two are closely joined; theology leads quite naturally to cosmology. Descartes on Reidentification, ALAN HART It is argued that the wax example in Meditation II is concerned with acquiring knowledge of the identity of a particular corporeal object and with its reidentification after it undergoes changes of its sensible qualities. Descartes employs the faculties of sensation, imagination (common sense), and reason, in a manner recalling the order of Meditation I, in his attempt to reidentify this piece of wax. He claims that reason alone suffices for his purposes. It is argued that none of the faculties considered separately will accomplish reidentification. In agreement with Laporte and Rodis-Lewis, it is noted that Descartes cannot account for existence of corporeal in dividuals; they exist only as relative substances. Finally, a Cartesian solution to the problem of reidentification, based on Notes and other works, requiring sensation as well as reason is suggested. Consent and Conventional Acts in John Locke, FRANK SNARE Meister Eckhart and the Later Heidegger: The Mystical Element in Heidegger's Thought?Part II, JOHN D. CAPUTO Having shown Heidegger's historical interest in medieval, partic ularly Eckhartian mysticism, and having sketched the main lines of Eckhart's thought in "Part One," Heidegger and Eckhart are now com pared in four specific points: to the "ground of the soul" in Eckhart there corresponds ilDasein" in Heidegger; to Eckhart's birth of the Son in the soul, Heidegger's "event;" to gel?zenheit in Eckhart, Gelassenheit in Heidegger; to the relation between God and creatures in Eckhart, the relation between Being and beings in Heidegger. A concluding section of the essay evaluates the significance of this striking analogy of Heidegger</page><page sequence="13">780 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS to the mystic. It asks, is "thought" a kind of mysticism for Heidegger? What interest can "philosophy" have for a thinker so akin to the mystic? La comprehension de l'?tre chez Ma?tre Eckhart et Heidegger?Part II, REINER SCHURMANN Existentialism, Idealism, and Fichte's Concept of Coherence, WALTER E. WRIGHT MIND Vol. LXXXIII, No. 332, October 1974 The Place of Pleasure in Aristotle's Ethics, AMELIE O. RORTY The Extensionality of Cause, Space and Time, WILLIAM G. LYCAN There is a well-known argument (the "Extensionality Argument") to the effect that any sentence-forming sentential operator which permits substitution (salva vert?ate) of coreferring singular terms and which also permits substitution of logically equivalent sentences, permits in addition substitution of materially equivalent sentences. (Church, Quine, Davidson, Anscombe, Kim, and others have invoked this argument for various pur poses.) In this paper it is argued that the Extensionality Argument is as it stands invalid. Proofs of slightly weaker conclusions are explored. Visual Noticing Without Believing, V. C. ALDRICH Theories of visual perception have, on the whole, failed to distinguish two senses of "order" and "clarity": one having to do with how things are "realized" in the visual field of good eye-sight, the other with how they are formulated in a conceptual system. The result of the failure is a conceptual and a perceptual muddle. This essay shows how even a modest or moderate "epistemic" treatment of the notion of "simply seeing something," such as Sibley's recent account, leaves things muddled. The Good and the True, R. B. DeSOUSA Duty and Inclination, NICHOLAS J. H. DENT Is it always the case when one acts from duty and acts from inclina tion or spontaneous feeling that these are two distinct motives to the</page><page sequence="14">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 781 action? It is argued that one may, from a sense of duty, so habituate one's desires that when one desires to do something one is precisely in doing so fulfilling one's duty. And one may, likewise, cultivate and train one's emotional responsiveness from a sense that it would be right to do so. So when one then acts out of spontaneous feeling one is in that doing just what one's sense of duty would require. It would be to distort the char acter of these cases to say the sense of duty was a separate source of the action ; it has its effect through the creation and maintenance of patterns of desire and feeling. The difference between merely "natural" responses and those cultivated in response to a sense of where one's duty lies is said to lie in certain propensities which "surround" the potential for acting in the required way; the "dutiful" man will e.g. seek to preserve these patterns of desire and feeling. Finally it is argued that only when natural habits of desire and feeling are consolidated and maintained by a sense that they are the right ones for a man to have do they comprise part of his "true self. ' ' Otherwise, they remain as mere accidental features of his character as an agent. THE MONIST Vol. 59, No. 2, April 1975 Heidegger and Death: A Deflationary Critique, PAUL EDWARDS This article deals with three of Heidegger's main theses about death. It is argued that when one penetrates the fog of Heideggerian verbiage each of these theses is either plainly false or else a bombastically expressed platitude. (1) Heidegger and his followers claim that everybody neces sarily dies "isolated" and "alone." In three senses in which one can construe this claim it is false ; in a fourth sense it is true but means no more than that everybody dies. (2) Heidegger maintains that death is un transferable, i.e. that nobody can die for another person. Heidegger him self notes the evidence which shows that this is false and then shifts (with out realizing that a shift has taken place) to the tautological platitude that the death a person dies must be his own and to the empirical platitude that everybody dies. (3) Heidegger maintains that by means of vorlaufen ("running ahead") I can get all my "not yets" including my death into the present. "Existentially" understood, death is thus seen to be a present and "internal" fact and not, as is commonly thought, external and some thing in the future. It is argued that this remarkable conclusion is reached by a perverse misuse of the words "is," and "death." All Heidegger ever shows to be "internal" and present are thoughts and emotions relating to death. Heidegger's confusions are in large measure the results of his being under the spell of pictures associated with the words vorlaufen, erstrecken ("reaching out"), einholen ("catching up with") and vor wegnehmen ("taking in advance"). Once the spell of these pictures is broken there is no tendency to maintain that the future is literally in the present.</page><page sequence="15">782 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Rationality and the Fear of Death, JEFFRIE G. MURPHY There is a long-standing tradition in philosophy which teaches that a truly wise or rational person will not fear death or at least (as Spinoza puts it) will not be "led" by such a fear. The purpose of this paper is to argue the fundamental soundness of this position. After the develop ment of a general account of the concepts "rational fearing" and "irra tional fearing," the concept of "the death of a person" is analyzed. The general account of rational and irrational fearing is then applied to the topic of death. Killing, Letting Die, and the Trolley Problem, JUDITH THOMSON Sleep and Death, HENRY W. JOHNSTONE, JR. This article is an attempt to argue in a new way to the conclusion that a person cannot conceive of his own death. For he can conceive of his own states of unconsciousness only as gaps in his conscious experience. A gap must have a beginning and an end; one can be aware of having been unconscious (and thus form the concept of unconsciousness) only at the end of a gap. But my death is the permanent cessation of my consciousness. Hence it is an endless gap. Since this phrase is a contradic tion, what it signifies is something I cannot conceive. Intimidations of Immortality, H. R. FRIEDMAN The Conquest of Death, ROLAND PUCCETTI In a this-worldly sense, the notion of conquering death reduces to the indefinite prolongation of life, which is a meaningful concept. Since in fact human death amounts to neocortical death, the problem is how to keep the brain alive and in contact with the extrabodily environment when, in the absence of genetic programming to the contrary, our bodies dete riorate after sexual maturity. It is proposed that this might be accom plished by isolating the brain in a prosthetic body which supplies the brain with glucose and oxygen but is not itself subject to deterioration: thus creating cyborg man. If the brain of cyborg man did not, under these conditions, die or become senile, human intellectual life, might come to span centuries rather than, as at present, a few decades only. Whether this prospect is appealing or not depends on one's view of the desirability of death, for which there seem to be no convincing arguments. Voluntary and Nonvoluntary Euthanasia, ROBERT YOUNG My procedure in this paper is to take up and consider a variety of arguments which have been employed by those opposed to the practice</page><page sequence="16">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 783 of voluntary euthanasia. I contend that each of those discussed is deficient. There is, therefore, strong defeasible force for the positive arguments that exist for giving legislative backing to the practice of voluntary euthanasia. In the latter part of the paper I argue that under certain stringent restric tions even some instances of non-voluntary euthanasia would be justified. THE NEW SCHOLASTICISM Vol. XLIX, No. 2, Spring 1975 Some Reflections on Religious Language, T. MICHAEL McNULTY Religious uses of language have certain characteristics that provide clues to their proper understanding. Any adequate theory of such use must take account of the non-dispassionate nature of investigation of religious truth and the transcendence of the object of such investigation. Critics like Flew have concealed value commitments which when exposed show such criticism to have nothing to do with the logic of religious statements. If religious use of language is viewed as an activity, it will be seen that such use cannot have a semantic dimension and still fulfill the religious purposes for which it is employed. Why Are Some Interpretations Better Than Others?, CHARLENE HADDOCK SEIGFRIED Becoming is the fundamental "fact" of experience for Nietzsche and underlies his view of man and the world. Because flux or change, rather than static substance or being, is primordial, there can be no privileged perspective from which to view reality; instead, there are a multitude of perspectives which structure reality. However, Nietzsche equates the arbitrary with chaos, so that, although there are many divergent, even contradictory perspectives, they are not necessarily arbitrary. The problem is to decide how to separate the one from the other. In order to determine whether Nietzsche's acceptance of some interpretations and rejection of others are justified or are themselves arbitrary choices, several interlocking themes are pieced together, largely from The Will to Power, where he explicitly discusses interpretation. First, perspectivism and the necessity of interpretation is explored, then the priority of instinctual versus con scious choices is clarified, and then what can be called Nietzsche's "theory of interpretation" is set forth. Finally, the relevance of truth and falsity for a universe in which everything is interpreted is taken up, as well as the appeal to life as a standard of interpretation. The Logic of Nihilism, CHARLES F. KIELKOPF This work was stimulated by a study of Stanley Rosen's Nihilism: A Philosophical Essay, Yale 1969. The basic insight provided by Rosen is</page><page sequence="17">784 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS that nihilism is tantamount to the position that we cannot justify our logic, or some improved version of it. I interpret being unable to justify our logic as having to accept in the language we use for epistemology the modal thesis : For any P it is possible that it is possible that P. I note that the modal systems S6 and SI which have this thesis are suitable logics for a nihilist. Effort is devoted to making it plausible that nihilism is adequately expressed with the modal formula saying that anything is possibly possible. Hume on Pride and Humility, ROBERT W. BURCH Hume's theory of pride and humility in the Treatise is composed of a "general system" and of five "limitations" on this system. His theory is supposed to be totally derivable from the "original," i.e. funda mental, features of human nature. The paper argues that Hume needs his five limitations because his general system by itself is an obviously false theory of pride and humility. However, it also argues, Hume is not en titled to add his limitations because doing so is inconsistent with the re quirement that the full theory be derivable from the original features of human nature. Moreover, the paper also argues that Hume's full theory, even ignoring its underivability from original qualities, is still false. What seems to lead Hume into this inconsistent and false account is his initial understanding of a passion as an indefinable simple impression. The Immutable God and Fr. Norris Clarke, LEWIS S. FORD Fr. W. Norris Clarke, S.J. in his essay, "A New Look at the Im mutability of God," makes a real contribution to the debate between classical and process theism, and hence deserves close consideration. It also suggests a fruitful synthesis between Thomistic esse, suitably rein terpreted, and Whitehead's cosmology. But it is hampered by its adherence to a logic of delimitation, which precludes the emergence of anything ulti mately new. We have criticized the implicit assumption that what is ab solutely infinite in perfection cannot be enriched by anything new, and have argued that the temporal enrichment of the divine plenitude does not undercut God's immutability as properly understood. What To Do with Austin's Words, JOHN J. YOUNG Austin held that asserting that p implies belief that p, but that not believing that p does not imply not-p. Let us call this "Austin's Thesis" (or "AT"). Wertz, (The New Scholasticism, Autumn, 1973) claims that AT is a necessary (analytic) truth. In this article, I argue that AT is not clearly stated. Neither Austin nor Wertz is careful enough in specifying the "vehicle of implication," so AT must be modified appropriately in terms of the speech act of expressing belief. But even then, initially</page><page sequence="18">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 785 plausible versions of AT turn out to be defective. This is so because the relevant sort of implication, so-called pragmatic implication, precludes the formulation of any thesis like AT which could be a necessary or analytic truth. Aetius, "De Placitis" I, 7. 7-9: A Fragment of Aristotle's "On Philos ophy," ANTON-HERMANN CHROUST This work, especially the section dealing with Epicurean views about the creative functions of God, ultimately goes back to Aristotle's On Philosophy. In their attacks upon Plato's creationist theory, the Epi cureans, with certain modifications, alterations, and additions, made use of Aristotle's On Philosophy, that is, of Aristotle's rejection of Plato's creationist thesis. This rejection is in keeping with Aristotle's theory of the uncreatedness and indestructibility of the world, a theory he also ex pounded in the On Philosophy. In this sense, De Placitis 300a 18-301a 7 (Diels) may be rightfully considered an authentic fragment of Aristotle's On Philosophy. Skinner and the Nature of a Science of Psychology, PATRICK K. DOOLEY This article examines Lapati's ("Skinner and the Nature of Man," New Scholasticism, 1973, pg. 501-515) contention that Skinner's be haviorism ought to be rejected on the grounds that it distorts the essential nature of man. It is argued that Lapati's criticisms are largely futile since the fundamental position for Skinner is not a concept of man but a concept of science. Lapati's concentration on a derivative rather than a primitive concept indicates a misunderstanding of the logical structure of Skinner's project. The article endorses Lapati's suggestion of the desirability of a humanist-behaviorist dialogue by outlining several im portant metapsychological, philosophical issues. Particular stress is given to the question of whether the basic commitment in psychology ought to be to a particular view of science or to a set of assumptions about the nature of man. NOUS Vol. VIII, No. 4, November 1974 Truth and Singular Terms, TYLER B?RGE A "free logic" for singular terms with restrictions on existential generalization and universal instantiation is set out and argued for. Weaker logics, such as Lambert's FD and FDI are held incapable of prov</page><page sequence="19">786 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS ing instances of Tarski's truth schema for languages containing non-de noting terms. Stronger logics, such as Scott's and Lambert's FD2, are held to yield false theorems when given natural interpretations. The logic defended conforms essentially to Russell's semantical intuitions. Some consequences are drawn for the theory of identity. The Identity Thesis and Neuropsychology, LAURENCE F. MUCCIOLO On Truth and Meaning, ALAN REEVES A correct theory of truth for a language may contain anomalous theses. An adequate account of meaning for a language may not. Hence, a correct theory of truth is not an adequate account of meaning. A theory of truth for a non-extensional language is not statable in a metalanguage employing no semantic terms outside the theory of reference. D. David son 's arguments to the contrary are criticised. Theories Whose Quantification Cannot Be Substitutional, T. S. WESTON Following a suggestion of Quine, the author shows that there are theories which can prove about themselves that their quantification can not be interpreted substitutionally. The example given of such a theory is Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, formulated in a language containing finitely many individual constants and function symbols. It is argued that such a language is the only sort which is both adequate for substitutional quanti fication and capable of reasonably good intertranslation with English. The final section of the paper deals with the failure of attempts to justify substitutional quantification via Skolem-Loewenheim arguments. On Why-Questions, PAUL TELLER Vol. IX, No. 1, March 1975 Causation as Explanation, MICHAEL SCRIVEN Attempts to analyze the concept of cause as a sufficient and/or necessary condition, or a part thereof, with or without the use of counter factuals, all "fail" in the sense that the analysis cannot handle certain families of counterexample without using some essentially causal notion. The most powerful counterexamples are cases of overdetermination, "un</page><page sequence="20">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 787 derdetermination" (i.e., inability to distinguish the cause from associated conditions), and the effect (which is a/the cause of its own cause on most analyses). If we analyze a cause as (roughly) the factor referred to in a single-factor explanation (and "explanation" in terms of understanding, not derivation from laws), we can easily handle these counterexamples and several other interesting features of causation (transitivity, irre flexivity, etc.). In the end, however, we cannot eliminate appeal to a cause-infected concept?for cause is an irreducible notion, not "analyz able" in the sense of "eliminable" but only in the weaker sense of "relatable to other concepts." How to Compare Theories: Reference and Change, ARTHUR FINE This article traces the impasse between the old and the new philos ophy of science (over the comparability or scientific theories) to a genuine indeterminancy in the theory of reference. It argues that the view of reference embedded in the new philosophy of science as well as that ex pounded by recent proponents of "rigid attachment" must handle stand ard cases of scientific change in implausible ways. The article suggests as a way out of the impasse a method of comparing theories by use of restricted coreference: coreference restricted to domains of overlap (vari ously specified) in which each theory is approximately true. Second-Order Theories of Predication: Old and New Foundations, NINO B. COCCHIARELLA Two general types of second order theories of predication are dis tinguished according to whether properties and relations (1) have an "individual" as well as a "predicative" nature or (2) have only a pre dicative nature which excludes their being logical subjects of predication in any sense which is logically similar to that in which individuals are. Typical ambiguity in simple type theory, ST, indicates that ST is really a second order theory of the first group, and a second order system ST* which is equiconsistent with ST is described and compared with Quine 's system NF as a first order counterpart to ST. Another second order theory, T*(*), also belonging to the first group is compared with ST*. A formulation of the property/class/set distinction shows that every class is a set in ST*, though not in T*(*), and that with an extensionality principle properties can be identified with classes in either system. Both theories, however, are amenable to a Fregean interpretation of subject-position oc currences of predicates as denoting concept-correlates (individuals) rather than concepts (properties) and thereby lead to two Fregean alternatives belonging to group (2). These Fregean alternatives are further dis tinguished in terms of a principle associating a special first-level concept with each second-level concept so that a first-level concept falls within the second-level concept iff its correlate falls under the special first-level concept.</page><page sequence="21">788 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Berkeley's Ideas of Sense, PHILLIP D. CUMMINS Thomas Reid interpreted Berkeley's dictum, Esse est per dpi, as ex pressing a position concerning the nature and status of immediate objects of sensory perception. Ideas of sense are sensations. According to Reid, a sensation is an entity which is part of or concurrent with an act of perceiving. He took Berkeley to be treating sensations as objects of perception. My essay explains further what Reid meant by "sensation," indicates why Reid's interpretation of Esse est per dpi makes it powerful enough to do the work Berkeley assigned it, and traces evidence that Berkeleyan ideas of sense are Reidian sensations. My goal is to render plausible Reid's interpretation of Berkeley. Husserl's Theory of Intentionality in Contemporary Perspective, FREDERICK A. OLAFSON Phenomenology and Hermeneutics, PAUL RICOEUR THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 25, No. 99, April 1975 Aristotle Number and Time, JULIA ANNAS In his account of time in Physics A, Aristotle exploits the idea that time is a kind of number. Since it appears from Metaphysics I that Aris totle is, in modern terms, an anti-Platonist about numbers, it may be that his analysis of time is also meant to be anti-Platonist, rejecting the existence of Time as an entity distinct from the activities of timing processes. The paper maintains that the argument of Physics A is indeed analogous to that of Metaphysics I, and that Aristotle also uses the idea that time is a kind of number in specific ways to guard against a platonist conception of time. Finally it discusses some points at which Aristotle's use of the thesis that time is a number appears to clash with some of his other ideas about time, especially as regards the instant or "now." Strawson's Transcendental Deduction, EDDY M. ZEMACH In both Individuals and The Bounds of Sense P. F. Strawson has argued that the No-Ownership theory of mental states is incoherent. He has argued for example, that the No-Ownership theorist must use, in stating his theory, a concept the validity of which the theory attempts to deny (i.e., that experiences are necessarily owned). I show that this</page><page sequence="22">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 789 argument is based on a confusion of modalities, mistaking de dicto for de re necessity. I further show that the very claim that sets of experiences are identifiable only through reference to their "havers" is mistaken. Mental events are individuated and grouped together exactly as physical events are. I therefore conclude that a person consists of, inter alia, mental particulars; his thoughts are his in the same sense that his legs are his own. Siding with Hume against Kant, Strawson, and Shoemaker, I argue that there are criteria for ascription of experience to persons and a person must use those criteria in ascribing experiences, even current ones, to himself. Hence, a person who misapplies those criteria may be mistaken in believing of a certain experience that it is (or is not) his own. Anthropomorphism and Analogy in Psychology, K. V. WILKES God and Forgiveness, ANNE C. MINAS It is not possible for God to exercise forgiveness, because of the incompatibility of the concepts of divinity and forgiveness. This is shown through examination of types of action that might be called forgiveness7 which all turn out to be actions a perfect being can't perform. Such ac tions include reversal of moral judgment, discovery of new facts, tempering or remission of punishment for either utilitarian or non-utilitarian reasons, ceasing or refusing to resent a human action, and removal of the char acteristic of wrongness from a human action. On Treating Like Cases Differently, NORMAN C. GILLESPIE On "On Theological Fatalism Again" Again, S. HAACK The paper is a reply to Helm's reply to the author's "On a theological argument for fatalism" (Philosophical Quarterly 1974). It is shown that Helm's criticism rests on a confusion of "Either God knows that p or God knows that not p'" with "God knows that either p or not pr," and that, with this confusion corrected, the author's original thesis that the theologi cal is a needlessly elaborated version of the logical argument for fatalism, stands. It is suggested, however, that the modal fallacy diagnosed in the logical argument for fatalism might be avoided by a theological version which included the premiss that God is necessarily omniscient. THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. LXXXIII, No. 4, October 1974 What Is It Like to Be a Bat?, THOMAS NAGEL</page><page sequence="23">790 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Volition and Basic Action, HUGH McCANN Non-volitional theories of human action seem unable to explain ade quately the difference between raising one's arm and merely having it rise. A theory of causally basic mental actions of volition solves this problem, and leads to no infinite regress, since volition is thinking, and thinking does not consist in bringing about a non-aetional change like the motion of a limb. The theory also sheds important light on the nature of inten tionality, and knowledge of one's own acts. Aristotle's Introduction of Matter, BARRINGTON JONES More Light on the Latter Mill, L. W. SUMNER With the publication in 1972 of his Later Letters, covering the period from 1849 to 1873, we now have for the first time a complete edition of the correspondence of John Stuart Mill. In this article I consider what phi losophers can learn from the contents of the Later Letters concerning Mill's relationship with Harriet Taylor, his political theory, and one of the more controversial questions about his ethical theory: whether he was a rule utilitarian. PHILOSOPHY Vol. 50, No. 192, April 1975 Kant's Philosophy of Religion, D. M. MacKINNON This article is mainly concerned with Kant's late work "Religion within the Bounds of Reason alone, ' ' and discusses the handling of certain fundamental theological ideas in that work, especially grace, redemption, and eschatology. It also includes fairly extended comment on his treat ment of Christ's person, and some account of the light thrown on the apparent pessimism of some of his better-known ethical writings by the doctrine of "Radical Evil in Religion." The article also seeks to illuminate some of the cruces in the first Kritik with the aid of this late work. The importance of Kant's distinction between intuitive and discursive under standing (found in the first and in the third Kritik) is stressed and it is suggested that in some respects this philosopher stands in the tradition of negative theology. Towards a Theory of Properties, D. M. ARMSTRONG The difficulties for Nominalism are overwhelming. Yet Empiricists have tended to be Nominalists. Why is this? I suggest that a bad argu</page><page sequence="24">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 791 ment for universals has been largely responsible : the Argument from the meaning of general terms. If it is maintained that there must be a dis tinct universal corresponding to each general term with a distinct meaning, then we know a priori what universals there are. Since they reject a priori metaphysics, Empiricists concluded that there are no objective universals (properties and relations). I maintain that the right reaction for an Empiricist is to reject the Argument from meaning instead. The way is then open for an a posteriori Realism, where it is a matter to be decided by total science (total inquiry) just what universals there are, that is, just what properties and relations particulars have. Desert, Equality and Injustice, LES IIOLBORROW This paper is concerned to identify and then to criticise a crucial set of unargued assumptions which are basic to the account of justice given by John Rawls in his recent A Theory of Justice. These assumptions centre around Rawls' second principle of justice, which holds that social and economic inequalities are just only if they result in compensating benefits to everyone, and in particular to the least advantaged members of society. It is contended that the application of this principle would have drastic effects, some of them concealed from Rawls because he oscillates between a Draconian and a more moderate interpretation of the principle. When these two interpretations are distinguished, it is seen that both versions run counter to many of our established attitudes towards natural talents. Whereas the stronger version is directly based on unargued egalitarian intuitions, the weaker interpretation appears to require a sig nificantly different moral basis. Personal Identity: A Defence of Locke, M. W. HUGHES A causal view of personal continuity is defended which is neutral towards dualism and materialism in the philosophy of mind. It argues that Locke stated such a view ; that the translation of his ' ' consciousness ' ' simply as "memory" is incorrect; that the difficulties raised for Locke by Butler and Elew vanish when Locke is properly understood; that recent discussion of such concepts as retrocognition and quasi-memory has not led to an improvement on Locke's theory. Aesthetic Appraisal, EVAN SIMPSON Many aesthetic concepts are both characterizing and evaluative, but this dual role does not correspond to separable functions. Rather, aesthetic terms denote qualities whose recognition includes acceptance of an evalua tion, e.g., that the object in question is noteworthy or admirable. This claim does not challenge the distinction between description and evalua tion ; it denies that factual, verifiable characterizations must be descriptive</page><page sequence="25">792 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS statements. The denial can be sustained and the notion of a non-natural quality can be given a much needed interpretation by showing that state ments of appraisal are verified by reference to distinctively social rather than objective facts. The relativism introduced by tying aesthetic judg ment to social perspectives is much meliorated by the relationship of such perspectives to bodies of knowledge and experience which can be shared. Parallel claims can be made for moral judgment. PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. XXXV, No. 2, December 1974 The A Priori-A Posteriori Distinction, DAVID BENFIELD The conflation of the epistemological distinction between the a priori and the a posteriori with the metaphysical distinction between the neces sary and the contingent and with the logical distinction between the analytic and the synthetic has been the source of needless philosophical problems. If these distinctions are not blurred and if one pays sufficient attention to the epistemological character of the a priori?a posteriori dis tinction, then the identification of the a priori with the necessary ceases to be a temptation. Indeed, I shall argue that epistemically basic proposi tions, that is, propositions which do not depend for their justification on any other proposition, are knowable a priori. Since many of these proposi tions are contingent and synthetic, this will be a rather radical thesis. After considering four objections to the thesis, I go on to provide several definitions of various a priori entities. I then explain why the a posteriori is not simply the logical complement of the a priori and I offer analogous definitions of a posteriori entities. The Idenity Theory and Criteria for the Mental, LAURENCE F. MUCCIOLO Philosophy and Ant i philosophy, NIKOLAI IRIBAD JAKOV As the special sciences made enormous achievements in their de velopment modern philosophy polarized into two fundamental and opposite concepts on the scientific nature and validity of philosophical knowledge. One is represented by Marxists, who regard it as a scientific, most powerful instrument for cognition and revolutionary transformation. The other, supported by idealist philosophers and not philosophically oriented scien tists gained popularity as antiphilosophy, denying the scientific nature of philosophy, proclaiming it meaningless barren verbal scholasticism.</page><page sequence="26">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 793 Philosophical problems are too general to be included in the specific areas of science, so the differentiation of the special sciences is not going to deprive philosophy of its problematics. Marxism defines philosophy as the science of the most general laws of development of the external world and human knowledge. As a scien tific Weltanschauung it is the essential methodological basis of all sciences, of all mental and practical activities. Willy-nilly any philosophy ulti mately joins one of the hostile ideological fronts, independing of the subjective intentions of its founders?it is always socially committed. The qualitative novelty of dialectical and historical materialism can be formulated in three major points: it follows materialism consistently and completely, it develops dialectics on a material basis, it combines the scientific approach to the philosophical problems with the struggle of the working class for communism. These principle features distinguish it from all idealistic and metaphysical philosophical speculations. Propositional and Nonpropositional Perceiving, DAN D. CRAWFORD In this paper, I discuss the interrelationships that exist between propositional and nonpropositional uses of perceptual verbs, e.g. "S sees that something is a door," and "S sees a door." I focus on Chisholm's definition of one propositional use and show that it is inadequate as it stands, in that it applies to cases in which one takes something to have some characteristic but is not perceiving it to have that characteristic. We must add the undefined expression "perceptually takes" to the definition, and I give reasons for thinking that this expression cannot be analyzed on commonsense grounds alone. I then argue for the general thesis that the concept of Perceiving in both of its most important propositional and nonpropositional senses has a dual function in that it refers to causal, psycho-physical facts, as well as conceptual facts, i.e. takings. On Time and Other Minds, MELVILLE STRATTON The purpose of this paper is to attempt to solve the problem of other minds. The method used involves introducing three new terms, each of which in some ways resembles, and in some ways differs from, the ordinary term ' ' exists. ' ' When the problem of other minds is restated with this new terminology, there is a pronounced increase in the complexity of the dis cussion and a pronounced decrease in the vagueness of the discussion. When the relevant thoughts of the average person are translated into the new terminology, a whole new realm of awareness opens up, so that ques tions never before even asked can now be asked. A complete solution to the problem of other minds is offered. A version of the principle of the relativity of time which is even more drastic than Einstein's version of the principle of the relativity of time is needed in the solution.</page><page sequence="27">794 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Brentano, Descartes, and Hume on Awareness, RICHARD E. AQUILA Brentano 's claims about intentionality do not bear solely on a concern with the positive nature of mental states. They also have no bearing on the problem of mental/material identity. Part of their point is just to oppose a certain view about the proper objects of mental states, namely that insofar as we are aware of such objects they have an existence "in the mind." Both Hume and Descartes held such a view. An examination of the notions of "idea" and "objective reality" shows the inaccuracy of regarding Descartes as a "representative realist." What "represents" external natures within the mind, according to Descartes, is just those natures themselves insofar as they come to exist in the mind. Vol. XXXV, No. 3, March 1975 Alienation: A Conceptual Analysis, TRONN OVEREND This paper is an examination of the philosophical presuppositions explicitly or implicitly adopted by social theorists in their employment of the concept: "alienation." Scrutiny is made of a variety of positions, both at the epistemological and ontological level. Apart from isolating the fallacies that alienation has a metaphorical meaning, that alienation has no meaning and/or should be rejected as a concept, and that alienation has evaluative meaning, an epistemological model is employed to attack the underlying assumptions in the sociological debate on values, and define the term through contingent identity statements. The central ontological issue investigated is whether alienation is a relational or qualitative fact ; and through this consideration conclusions drawn include wheather aliena tion is a process, and the measurability of alienation. Essentialism and Possible Worlds, JAMES E. TOMBERLIN On the Relation of Natural Properties to Normative and Evaluative Proper ties, PHILLIP T. MONTAGUE The following three statements are commonly assumed to be true by many moral philosophers: (1) Our knowledge of the presence of normative and evaluative properties in objects and actions is dependent or consequent upon our knowledge of the presence of natural properties in those objects and actions. (2) The presence of normative and evaluative properties in objects and actions is dependent or consequent upon the presence of natural properties in those objects and actions. (3) The truth of (1) pre supposes the truth of (2).</page><page sequence="28">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 795 In this paper I argue against assumption (2) by first pointing out how difficult it is to produce a plausible interpretation of the dependence or consequence relation mentioned in this statement; and secondly, by showing how an argument commonly offered in support of (2) can be construed as leading to a rather different conclusion. I then attempt to give some reason for rejecting (3) by suggesting how one might account for (1) without assuming (2). Direct Perception, D. D. TODD Norman Malcolm's paper "Direct Perception" is criticized. Its mis takes are identified and its insights are extracted. The identificatory/ descriptive components of perceptual claims are examined, sense-data are found to be congeners of the description half of the dichotomy, and the indirect/direct perception distinction is found to be a queer reflection of the identification/description distinction and not a distinction between two types of perception correlated with two types of "object," i.e., material objects and sense-data. Sense-data are found to belong to a primitive epistemic level much lower than those which are conceptualized in terms of the private/public, physical/mental, real/unreal, etc. distinctions. Epi stemological and ontological priority are separated. The metaphysics of Common Sense is found to be compatible with a weakened epistemological phenomenalism. Heidegger's Theory of Metaphysics and Dialectics, JAMES LAWLER Hume, Price, and Testimony, R. A. NAULTY and P. J. SHEEHAN In his book Belief, H. H. Price argues that we do not have enough evidence to justify the credence we give to testimonies. So instead of evidential support for such beliefs, Price turns to prudential support: if we accept the reports of witnesses we shall acquire much more information than we should otherwise. But that plainly assumes that the information is reliable, so the question of the truth of that assumption reasserts itself. We point out that there is much more evidence for the truth of the assumption than either Price and Hume realize. But even so, the nature of the case makes it difficult to know whether there is enough evidence. If there is not, we suggest, that makes testimony an irreducible way of finding out about facts, along with perception, introspection, memory, and deduction.</page></plain_text>
