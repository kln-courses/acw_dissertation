<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES TOWARDS A LEXICON OF THE SEPTUAGINT. I WHEN Edwin Hatch delivered his Grinfield Lectures on the Septuagint (published in 1889 as Essays in Biblical Greek), he expressed his gratification that 'the great school of Cambridge scholars' had turned from their labours on the New Testament to pro duce a critical edition of the LXX, and he lamented that the student of biblical Greek still lacked the essential tools for his work—an adequate dictionary and grammar. Modesty, no doubt, caused him to omit con cordance from the list, since his own team of Oxford scholars was already engaged in filling that need. In the intervening years New Testament Greek has been well supplied with critical tools, but the LXX still has no other completed aid to its study than the Concordance of Hatch and Redpath. The Cambridge Septuagint, well begun, remains and seems likely to remain, like so many other monumental works, incomplete; and, although critical texts have been produced by con tinental scholars, they are eclectic texts from which the bewildered reader turns back with relief to the simpler inadequacies of Swete. Thackeray's Grammar of the Old Testament in Greek never got beyond morphology. And for dictionary we still have to rely, grateful for small mercies, on the ninth edition of Liddell and Scott (LSJ). With a few honourable exceptions, students of the LXX have concentrated their efforts on the problems of its text, presumably thinking that, until these were settled, any work on lexicography or grammar would be wasted. It is now, however, coming to be recognized that textual problems can rarely be settled without appeal to internal evidence; and for the LXX this includes a wide knowledge of the usage of the various translators who produced it. The need for a sound dictionary of the LXX is therefore greater than ever today. Many valuable contributions to Septuagintal lexicography are, indeed, tobefoundinKittel's Theologisches WorterbuchzumNeuen Testament. But this work as a whole is spoiled, as James Barr has shown (The Semantics of of Biblical Language), by the lack of any sound linguistic method. It is possible to produce a dictionary of words, arranged alphabetically, or a dictionary of concepts, in which synonyms are grouped thematically (as in Roget's Thesaurus). But a hybrid of the two, in which words and concepts are confused, is bound to be a linguistic monster. It is also [Journal of Theological Studies, N.S., Vol. XIX, Pt. 2, October 1968I 621.2 G g</page><page sequence="2">454 G· Β. CAIRD a quite arbitrary procedure to isolate theological terms from the total vocabulary, as though they operated with linguistic rules of their own. Anyone who tries to read the LXX with the help of LSJ soon becomes aware of a similar lack of linguistic method. The admirable principles which have governed the compilation of the Lexicon as a whole are all too often neglected in the Septuagintal entries, and no systematic consideration has been given to the problems raised by the fact that the LXX is for the most part a translation of a Semitic text. Morphology and etymology apart, the object of a Greek lexicon is to list all the significations of a word and, as far as the evidence allows, to trace its history by citing the earliest known usage of each of its meanings. To this end the lexicographer must observe some well-established principles, of which we may select three for special attention: 1. 1. Important as etymology is in helping us to decipher meaning, it is usage alone that determines meaning. The ultimate test of a successful definition is whether its substitution for the given word produces the sense required in the context. 2. If the exact semantic contribution of a word to its context is to be discovered, Mill's distinction between connotation (what is said) and denotation (what it is said about) must be preserved. LSJ does this by printing connotation in italic and denotation in roman type. 3. In particular, there is a difficult distinction to be drawn between live and dead metaphor. In live metaphor a word still carries its literal sense but is applied to an unusual referent, and the effectiveness of metaphor is due to the clash between connotation and denotation. In dead metaphor habitual use has removed the clash and produced a new literal meaning; a semantic change has occurred, in which the habitual denotation has been fed back into the connotation and so has become part of the dictionary meaning of the word. There are two reasons why the LXX is of special importance to Greek lexicography. The first is that in many instances it provides the only or the earliest evidence for Hellenistic usage. The second is that the use of Greek words to translate Hebrew ones frequently produced a semantic change which persisted into later Greek, by no means always confined to Christian circles. The lexicographer of the LXX does not need, of course, to concern himself with the earlier history of words, except that he needs to know whether a word belonged to the common vocabulary of Hellenistic speech, was a technical term of a group (e.g. philosophers), or was an archaism derived from the reading of ancient literature. But in addition to this he needs to ask some questions which</page><page sequence="3">TOWARDS A LEXICON OF THE SEPTUAGINT I 455 are peculiar to his branch of the subject. Any word or expression found in the LXX will fall into one or other of nine classes. It may be: 1. 1. Well-attested Greek usage which adequately renders the Hebrew; 2. Well-attested Greek usage which inadequately renders the Hebrew, because the translator for reasons of his own decided to alter or improve on the original; 3. Well-attested Greek usage which points to a misreading of the Hebrew text or to a variant reading; 4. The only or the earliest surviving instance of a piece of current Hellenistic speech; 5. An instance of semantic change induced by the new associations which the Greek term has acquired by being placed in a Hebrew context; 6. A neologism, invented by the translator, usually by analogy with other accepted forms, because he knew of no Greek equivalent for his Hebrew expression (the translator would not necessarily have been aware that the word did not already exist); 7. A strained or unnatural usage, produced by mechanical methods of translation; 8. A transliteration from the Hebrew; 9. A form or a meaning produced by textual corruption in the Greek and having no real existence in current speech or in the intention of the translator. I do not pretend that it is always easy to classify Septuagintal usage. The borderlines between classes 4, 5, and 6 are frequently hard to discern. But for accurate lexicography the attempt must be made. It is also important to observe that some instances of class 6 and most instances of class 7 will prove to be solecisms which never became part of current speech, even in the synagogue, and which therefore have no place in a dictionary of the Greek language; and that, on the contrary, some examples of class 8 became naturalized in the Greek vocabulary and remain in use to this day. While we wait for a full Lexicon of the Septuagint compiled along these lines, a useful beginning may be made by correcting what we already have in LSJ. After that it will be time enough to think of filling out the omissions. I do not claim that what follows is a complete list of corrigenda. But it illustrates most of the principles I have enumerated above, and I hope it may constitute a small initial con tribution to the lexicography of the LXX.1 1 Since these notes were completed, my attention has been drawn to the important lexicographical work of H. S. Gehman, now deposited on microfilm in the library of Princeton Theological Seminary.

To begin with, someone's handwriting has been misread. The RV reads 'he was proved to be a prophet'. But even this rendering can hardly be accepted, since it fails to do justice to the idea of exactness, accuracy, or precision inherent in ακριβής. The Hebrew reads 'because of his reliability he was consulted as a seer'; so that we are clearly dealing, as so often in Ecclesiasticus, with a deliberate improvement on grandfather's Hebrew. That being so, it is unlikely that the word is a neologism, although its earliest attested use is in this passage. The meaning required by derivation and context is 'to prove accurate', ,because he was reliable, he proved an accurate prophet'. 2. άκριβασμός. LSJ—commandment, LXX 3 Ki. 11. 34: pi., ά. καρδίας searchingssearchings of heart, ibid. Jd. 5. 15 (cod. A)·, portion, gift, Aq. Ge. 47. 22. This word occurs as a rendering of חק nine times in Aquila and four times in the LXX, always in the A text. We begin, then, with a suspicion that the A text may have been contaminated from Aquila, though this can hardly be more than a suspicion, since all four passages are in the work of the later translators, many of whom shared to a large extent the mechanical methods of Aquila. The first of LSJ's defi nitions may be allowed to stand. The verb ακριβΐύω is found in the passive in a late papyrus with the meaning 'receive precise instructions'. There is thus no reason why άκριβασμός should not mean 'precise instructions, express command'. The third definition is less satisfactory. The passage cited has to do with the food ration allotted by Pharaoh to the priests, and the note of precision ought not to be omitted from Aquila's rendering, even though the LXX (δόμα), Symmachus (συνταξις), and Theodotion (μίρις) all failed to bring it out. As a translation of the Hebrew, RSV has 'fixed allowance', which seems to be just what is required for Aquila's Greek. Much more serious trouble arises over the second definition. There are textual difficulties in Judges v. 15-16, both in Hebrew and in Greek, partly caused by the repetition of a half-verse, but with variations in both versions. The Hebrew has in the first instance, 'among the clans of Reuben there were great resolves of mind (חק.קי־לב)'; and in the second instance, 'among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart (חקלי־לב)'. The LXX A text has ακριβασμοι καρδίας and ΐξιχνιασμοϊ καρδίας, and the Β text has ϊξικνοΰμΐνοιϊξικνοΰμΐνοι καρδίαν (which is almost certainly a Greek transcriptional error for ίζιχνιασμοί καρδίας) and ΐξετασμοl καρδίας. Thus the emended Β text points to a Hebrew Vorlage in which הקלי stood in both verses, and most editors emend the Hebrew text in this way. The Hebrew Lexicon of Brown, Driver, and Briggs (BDB), in defending the MT,</page><page sequence="5">TOWARDS A LEXICON OF THE SEPTUAGINT I 457 needs a special entry under pfl to deal with this passage: 'actionprescribed for oneself, resolveand, if we accept this, it will follow that LSJ ought to give 'resolve' as the second meaning of άκρφασμός. In any case, 'searchings of heart' cannot be correct, for this is the meaning of ל1קרי־לב; and, whether άκρφασμός stood in the original LXX or was introduced by a scribe, either the translator or the scribe used it as the equivalent of ph. The likelihood, however, is (a) that the original read קלי!! in both verses, or did not repeat the line at all; (b) that the original LXX reading was that of the emended Β text; and (c) that άκρφασμός άκρφασμός is a purely conventional rendering by a scribe who knew only the corrupt Hebrew text and altered the Greek to make it agree with the Hebrew he knew. 3. άκριβαστής. LSJ—lawgiver, Aq. Is. 33. 22; inquirer, id. Jd. 5. 14. In each case the word is used to render ppil)?, which four times in the LXX means a sceptre and three times a commander. 'Lawgiver' is therefore a reasonable definition. But the second definition is quite impossible, and it appears to have been introduced by a rather complex process. In Judges v. 14 the LXX translator read, or thought he read, מחברים instead of מחקקים and translated it by εξερευνώντΐς. It is the meaning of this LXX mistranslation which has somehow found its way into LSJ as the definition of the more accurate, if somewhat stilted, translation of Aquila, who was using άκρφαστής simply as a conventional equivalent for ppH!?. 4. αλλαγμα. LSJ—that which is given or taken in exchange ... 2. reward, price price of a thing ... 3. change, vicissitude, LXX Si. 2. 4. The third definition is not, indeed, impossible (it has the support of the RSV); but it must be considered highly improbable. The cited passage runs ev άλλάγμασιν ταπανώσεώς σου μακροθύμησοv. In every other passage in which it occurs αλλαγμα contains the idea of exchange or price, and in the LXX the phrase ev άλλάγματι is found three times with the meaning 'at a price' (2 Kingdoms xxiv. 24; 3 Kingdoms x. 28; Lam. v. 4). The third of these is worth quoting in full: ύδωρ ημών ev άργυρίω ίπίομΐν· ξυλαξυλα ήμών ev άλλάγματι ήλθεν. 'The water we drank cost money; the wood we gathered had to be paid for.' In the light of these parallels the literal meaning of Ecclus. ii. 4. is: 'be patient at the cost of your humbling', i.e. 'be patient under humiliation whatever it cost'. Where the regular meaning of a Greek word gives good sense, there is no need to invent a special one. 5. άλοάω. LSJ—... tread, thresh ... 3. destroy, iroAeis LXX Je. 5. 17.</page><page sequence="6">458 G. Β. CAIRD The Hebrew verb used in Jer. v. 17 means ,batter down'; but we may not therefore assume that the translator was using άλοάν as a dead meta phor.phor. In Judgesviii.7; Mic. iv. 13; Isa. xli. 15, where it translates דיצי, and in Jer. xxviii (li). 33, where it translates the hiphil of ךו״ך, the metaphor is clearly alive and vivid. It is likely, then, that in Jer. v. 17, as elsewhere, the Greek verb has its normal meaning of 'threshing' or ,treading down'. 6. άνάμνησίξ. LSJ— ... 2. memorial sacrifice, LXX Nu. 10.10, cf. Ev. Luc.Luc. 22. 19. This entry appears to have originated in someone's naive attempt to introduce the idea of sacrifice into the Lucan narrative of the Last Supper. For Num. x. 10 describes the blowing of the ceremonial trumpets ,as a reminder in the presence of your God' and has nothing whatever to do with sacrifice. Hebrew has two words for memorial, ז^רון and אזויךה, both of which are regularly represented in the LXX by μνημόσυνον. In LSJ there are no LXX entries under μνημόσυνον, presumably because it was recognized that in every case the word has its common Greek meaning. p*1pt always means memorial or reminder and it is used of a number of physical objects, such as the gems on Aaron's vestments. Of the twenty-three passages in which it occurs only two (Num. v. 5, 18) are in any way connected with sacrifice, and there the idea of sacrifice is contained in the context and not in the word. The definition of άνάμνησις as ,a memorial sacrifice' would not have been so ludicrous if the passage cited in support had been Lev. xxiv. 7, though it would still have been wrong. Here the Hebrew word is אזכרה. which belongs to the language of sacrifice. In the six other passages in which it is found, it is a technical term of the Priestly Code for that part of the cereal offering which was set aside to be burnt as a memorial token. But in Lev. xxiv. 7 it denotes the frankincense used in connection with the shewbread. According to Josephus (Ant. III. vi. 6), this was placed in gold cups on top of the bread, in order that, as Lev. xxiv. 7 puts it, ,it may be a burnt offering to Yahweh as a memorial in place of the bread'. Once again, the idea of sacrifice is in the context and is not part of the semantic contribution of either אן^ךה or άνάμνησις. ך.ך. άνάνΐυσις. LSJ—(νεομαι) return, revival, LXX Ps. 72 (73). 4. This definition is based on a most improbable derivation and one which is belied by the arrangement of LSJ, whereby άνανεΰω is included in the same paragraph. The meaning given for άνανεύω is: 'throw the head back back in token of denial, make signs of refusal'. We should therefore expect άνάνευσιςάνάνευσις to mean ,denial, refusal'. The verse in which it occurs runs: ότι ουκ εστίν άνάνευσις iv τω θανάτω αυτών, και στερέωμα iv τη μάστιγι αυτών.</page><page sequence="7">TOWARDS A LEXICON OF THE SEPTUAGINT I 459 The translator evidently took the second line to mean that the psalmist envied lawless men because there is no strength or persistence in the plagues they suffer. It would have been nonsense for him to say in the same breath that he envied them because there is no revival for them when they die. The translator was faced with the rare word חך^3ות, which he did not understand, and with a text that was already wrongly divided (למווןם instead of ימו: תם?), and he had to make the best of it. He assumed that חךצבות was derived from ןזרץ and meant *decisions': 'there is no decision against them, no reprobation, involved in their death.' Thus άνάνιυσις has in fact the meaning we should expect from its derivation from άνανΐΰω. 8. αναφορά. LSJ—. . . 4. offering, LXX Ps. 50 (51). 21 ... 9. office of of άναφορΐύς, LXX Nu. 4. 6, 10. Immediately below this we find: 'άναφορΐΰς, bearer, bearing-pole, LXX Ex. 25. 12 (13) sq., al.' This second entry is thoroughly accurate, provided that 'bearer' is understood to be a synonym for 'bearing-pole'. The word occurs sixteen times as a translation of 3ד and four times as a translation of מוט, both of which denote the poles or bars used for carrying the ark. But the previous entry can be explained only on the supposition that someone has taken 'bearer' to be a person. To this we must add that αναφορά does not in fact occur in Num. iv. 6, 10. It does occur in Num. iv. 19: και καταστησουσιν αυτούς Ικαστον κατά την άνα φοράν φοράν αύτοΰ ('and they shall station them each according to his offer ing'), where αναφορά has the same meaning as in Ps. 1 (li). 21. 9. άνθέμιον. LSJ— = άνθος ... 2. honeysuckle pattern on Ionic columns ... 3. of gold, the purest quality, LXX Ec. 12. 6. This last definition has no obvious justification and makes no sense whatever in the passage cited. The young man is urged to remember his Maker: ecus οτου μή ανατραπη το σχοινιον του αργυρίου, και και και συντριβή το άνθέμιον τοΰ χρυσίον. This couplet may be taken in either of two ways. It may be that τοΰ άργυρίουάργυρίου and τοΰ χρυσίου are descriptive genitives, and that the Greek has retained the metaphorical character of the Hebrew: 'or ever the silver cord (of life) snaps and the golden bloom (of youth) is shattered'. But for 'silver' and 'golden' the LXX translators more commonly use the adjectives άργυροΰς and χρυσοΰς, and the nouns άργύριον and χρΰσιον are for the most part kept to denote silver and gold money. So the translator may have intended to say: 'or ever the cord of silver (money) snaps and the lustre of gold is shattered'. Either sentiment would be</page><page sequence="8">460 G. Β. CAIRD well enough in keeping with the general tenor of Ecclesiastes. But in either case άνθεμιον is a pathetic diminutive of άνθος in one of its usual senses. 10. άνταποδίδωμι. LSJ—give back, repay, tender in repayment or requital requital... 2. take vengeance, LXX De. 32. 35, al. ανταπόδοση,ανταπόδοση, giving back in turn, . . . rendering, requiting, repayment, . . . retribution, LXX Is. 61. 2, 63. 4, al. The question here is simply whether these words are to be regarded as a live or as a dead metaphor. If, as I believe, the metaphor is still felt to be alive, then 'requital' is justified in their definition, but 'ven geance' and 'retribution' introduce ideas from the context which are not, or at least not yet, part of their dictionary meaning. 11. 11. άντίον. LSJ—a part of the loom, Ar. Th. 822. ... 2. generally, loom,loom, άντίον ΰφαινόντων LXX 2 Ki. 21. 19, al. This word occurs in three passages in the LXX, and in all three it provides a comparison for the haft of a man's spear. It is surely difficult to believe that any ancient warrior ever carried a spear with a haft like a loom, or that any ancient writer ever thought this possible. The spear-haft is in fact being likened to the round upper crossbeam of the loom. The entry in LSJ gives the impression that the word is known to have had one meaning in Aristophanes and quite a different one in the LXX. The truth is that it is only by reference to the LXX that we can identify the meaning of the word in Aristophanes. 12. αντιτάσσω. LSJ—. . . II. Med., set oneself against, meet face to face face ... 2. generally, oppose, resist... 3. set against, compare, LXX Pr.Pr. 3. 15 (Pass.). The passage in question runs: τιμιωτερατιμιωτερα δε εστίν λίθων πολυτελών ουκ ουκ άντιτάζεται avrfj ούδεν πονηρόν. For the second line the Hebrew reads: 'nothing you can desire could compare with her'; but we cannot therefore assume that this is the meaning intended by the translator. It makes very poor sense to say of wisdom: 'she is more valuable than precious stones; nothing evil can be compared with her'. Instead of reproducing the Hebrew exactly, the translator has added an idea of his own: 'no evil thing can withstand her'. The verb has its normal meaning; and, incidentally, it is not passive but middle. 13. αντρον. LSJ—poet, word, cave ... II. inner chamber, closet, LXX 3 Ki. 16. 18. In this one instance αντρον is used to render the Hebrew ]אלמו, the</page><page sequence="9">TOWARDS A LEXICON OF THE SEPTUAGINT I 461 i nner keep or redoubt of a fortified enclosure or palace. Thus the LSJ definition gives entirely the wrong impression. This Hebrew word gave the LXX translators a great deal of trouble, as may be seen from the variety of words they used for it—θεμίλιον, χώρα, β5.pis. The passage under consideration falls within the chapters of Kingdoms translated by Thackeray's third translator, who, though not as slavish and literal istic as the fourth, was quite capable of choosing άντρον with no better reason in mind than that it sounded vaguely like the Hebrew word for which he was at a loss to find an adequate equivalent. It is therefore dubious whether this passage can be said to have added anything to the dictionary meaning of άντρον. 14. άττοξίνόω. LSJ—. . . 4. Med., disguise oneself, LXX 3 Ki. 14. 5. Here LSJ is right in thinking that the translator has used the Greek word in a sense not elsewhere attested, but the meaning given is strangely out of keeping with the context. Ahijah was blind, and no change of guise could make any difference to his powers of recognition. What Jeroboam's wife did, as is plain from the use of the hithpael in Hebrew, was to act the part of a stranger; and this sense is quite effectively conveyed by the Greek translation. 15. άττοσκορακισμός- LSJ—casting off utterly, LXX Is. 66. 15. I include this entry not because it is wrong but because it is wrong headed. The definition given is not related to the word's derivation, it is stilted English, it cannot be naturally inserted into the one context in which the word is found, and it lacks even the meagre justification of being drawn from the AV or RV. The noun σκορακισμός denotes the contemptuous dismissal implied by the imprecation is κόρακας, and άποσκορακισμόςάποσκορακισμός is a strengthened form of it, used by the Greek trans lator of Isaiah to denote Yahweh's formal abjuration, renunciation, repudiation of his enemies. 16. αστράγαλος. LSJ—one of the vertebrae ... II. ball of the ankle joint joint . . . III. wrist, LXX Da. 5. 5, 24. IV. pi., . . . knucklebones used as dice. The short entry introduced by III comprises a remarkable variety of error. Firstly, for 'LXX Da.' read 'Thd. Da.'·, the 0' text has χειρ in the one instance and a lacuna in the other. Next, we are asked to believe that the writing on the wall was produced by a phantom wrist, and this in spite of two facts which make the suggestion a linguistic as well as an anatomical absurdity. In Dan. v. 5 the word αστράγαλος is actually in the plural, and it picks up the earlier statement in the same verse that what Belshazzar saw was δάκτυλοι χειρός. The noun αστράγαλος has in Greek the same range of meaning as the word 'knuckle' has in</page><page sequence="10">462 G. Β. CAIRD English, and the correct definition of it in Theodotion's Daniel is not 'wrist' but ,fist'. 17. βαθύγλωσσος. LSJ—of unintelligible speech, λαός LXX Es. 3. 5. For 'Es.' read Έζ.' This is an erratic reading of B, which probably arose by haplography from the correct reading Λαόν βαθυχΐΐλον και βαβαβαρόγλωσσον. So it is doubtful whether the word really forms part of the vocabulary of the LXX. In any case the definition is wrong. The point is not that the speech was unintelligible, but that it 'sounded guttural and thick to Hebrew ears' (G. A. Cooke, The International Critical Commentary,Commentary, ad 10c.). When we turn toβαρΰγλωσσος, we find the remark able definition: ,grievous of tongue'—a phrase more suitable to ulcers or a nagging wife than to a foreign nation, if indeed it has ever been used elsewhere by lips or pen. 18. βαθύφωνος. LSJ—of deep, i.e. hollow, voice, LXX Is. 33. 19. The Greek translator has punctuated the text in so odd a fashion that his version is difficult to construe. But 'i.e. hollow' hardly helps. Here too it is likely that guttural speech is intended. 19. βαρυκάρδιος. LSJ—heavy, slow of heart, LXX Ps. 4. 2. The translator misread כביד, לכלמה, '(how long shall) my glory be turned to shame ?', as כבדי־לב : למה, and coined a word to render his aberrant reading. But the definition given hardly fits the context. The sufferer is accusing men of being hard-hearted, not heavy or slow of heart. Compare the use of βαρύνω for the hardening of the heart. 20.20. βάσανος. LSJ—touchstone ... II. the use of this as a test . . . generally, test, trial of genuineness ... III. inquiry by torture ... 2. agony of of battle ... 3. trespass-offering, LXX 1 Ki. 6. 17. The word occurs four times in 1 Kingdoms vi. 3, 4, 8, and 17 in connection with the restitution made by the Philistines for their seizure of the ark. In each case the Hebrew has א#ם, and LSJ has simply trans ferred to βάσανο? the meaning of what appeared to be the Hebrew counterpart. But such a meaning could not conceivably have developed out of the regular Greek usages. It is indeed far from clear what sense the translator meant to convey; but this much is clear, that βάσανος, occurring all four times in the genitive, cannot properly be treated as the direct object of άποδιδόναι, and particularly in vi. 4—τί τό της της βασάνου άττοδώσομΐν αύτη; The best suggestion is that the word is being used in one of its normal meanings, that the genitive is the genitive of price, and that the Philistines are asked to pay compensation to the ark for the test of strength to which they have exposed it.</page><page sequence="11">TOWARDS A LEXICON OF THE SEPTUAGINT I 463 21. βασκαίνω. LSJ—bewitch by the evil eye . . . LXX De. 28. 56. ... II. c. acc., malign, disparage . . . 2. c. dat., envy, grudge. The LXX reference appears to be misplaced. The context in Deut. xxviii. 56 has to do with niggardliness, not witchcraft, and the sense required there and in verse 54 is 'to turn a grudging eye upon* (cf. Ecclus. xiv. 6, 8). It should also be noted that βάσκανος means ,grudging' or 'stingy' in Prov. xxiii. 6, xxviii. z2; Ecclus. xiv. 3, xviii. 18, xxxvii. ix, and that this meaning is not recognized in LSJ. 22. βδελύσσομαι. LSJ—. . . II. later causal, in Act., cause to stink, make make loathsome or abominable, . . . LXX Le. 20. 25 . . . Ex. 5. 21. This is misleading, because no indication is given that the phrase 'cause to stink' is being used figuratively. In Exod. v. 21 the foremen say to Moses, 'You have caused the smell of us to be repulsive to Pharaoh and his court'; but the smell is in the context, not in the verb, which simply means 'to make repulsive'. 23. βολίξ. LSJ—missile, javelin ... 2. sounding-lead ... 3. αστραπών βολίδες βολίδες βολίδες flashes of lightning, LXX Wi. 5. 21; αστραπή βολίς (sic) ibid. Za.Za. 9. 14. The (sic) here suggests that the translator has made some appalling solecism. The sentence runs: καί κύριος εσται επ' αυτούς, και έξελεύσεται ώςώς αστραπή βολίς. LSJ has apparently taken this to mean: 'the Lord shall appear over them and shall go out as a lightning bolt.' But the Hebrew has: 'the Lord shall appear over them, and his arrow shall go forth as lightning'; and this is almost certainly the meaning intended by the Greek. 24. γαία. LSJ—poet, for γη, land, country ... 2. earth . . . the forms γαιών,γαιών, γαίαις, γαίας in codd. of LXX are written for γεών, etc. It is not clear whether we are to suppose that the archaic forms stood in the LXX autographs and were subsequently corrected in some manuscripts, or that the autographs had γεών etc., which some scribes erroneously wrote as γαιών etc. But in either case we are asked to believe that γεών etc. were the accepted forms and that the others are due to mis-spelling. There can be no doubt that such mis-spelling is possible, since ε and at were by this time pronounced alike, and there are many examples of their interchange in papyri written by semi-literate people. But it is not therefore to be concluded that this was the operative cause of these particular spellings, and there are several reasons to the contrary. (a)(a) In the two places where variants exist, they are γας and γαΐς. (b) The codices in which the archaic forms occur do not make other vowel substitutions of this kind (e.g. in the lists of names in 1 and 2 Esdras there are some examples of the interchange of ε and ai, but they are</page><page sequence="12">464 G.

'Quarries' is the AV translation, which goes back to the Targum and the Peshitto, but 'is an unnecessary and unwarranted departure from the well-known meaning of the word' (G. F. Moore, The Inter national national Critical Commentary, ad 10c.). The Hebrew has פסילים which always means 'carved idols'. In Judges ii. 2, where there is no Hebrew equivalent, the LXX has τά γλυπτά αυτών συντρίψετε, which obviously refers to idols. At Judges iii. 19, 26 the carved stones in question were presumably the stone circle from which Gilgal took its name. 26. γνώριμος. LSJ— ... 3. Subst., acquaintance . . . b. pupil . . . c. kinsman, LXX Ru. 3. 2. This word is used twice in Ruth to translate מודעת ,מודע, for which BDB gives 'kinsman, kindred'. But these Hebrew words are derivatives of ידע, 'to know', and occur nowhere else except in Prov. vii. 4, where RSV correctly renders 'intimate friend'. We may leave it an open question whether מודע ever meant 'kinsman'. What is clear is that the LXX translator rendered it by γνώριμος because he recognized its etymology and took it to mean 'acquaintance'. 27. γνωριστής. LSJ—one that takes cognizance of . . . II. diviner, LXX 4 Ki. 23. 24. The logic that lies behind this definition is more clearly expressed in the entry under γνωστής: 'esp. one who knows the future, diviner, LXX ι Ki. 28. 3'; but it is by no means certain that this is the true explanation of the use of either word. Both are translations of לךעני, which appears to have been. used, along with its constant partner אוב, to denote either male and female mediums or the familiar spirits with which the mediums consorted. Such mediums are more likely to have been called 'knowers' because of their acquaintance with their familiars than for any knowledge they had of the future, since, apart from their 'controls', they would have had little personal knowledge of anything unusual. But even this may be too rational to be true. The fourth translator of Kingdoms was more given to penny-in-the-slot methods than most of his predecessors, and in this case he has simply relied on etymology. His translation of וגם את־האובות ואת״הלךענים is και γε τους θελητάς καί τους τους γνωριστάς. He has derived אוב from אבה, 'to be willing', and יךעני from זידע, 'to know'. The second derivation by itself would be plausible, but the first is ridiculous, and so both are suspect. Thus, in conclusion,</page><page sequence="13">TOWARDS A LEXICON OF THE SEPTUAGINT I 465 *diviner' is not the right definition; and there is a further question whether a strained, etymologizing translation can be said to add to the dictionary meaning of any word. 28. γομφιάζω. LSJ—have pain in the back teeth or gnash them ... LXX Si.Si.Si.Si. 30. 10. 2. of the teeth, suffer pain, ibid. Ez. 18. 2. We may well ask whether it is likely that any language should have a special word for toothache in the back teeth. Would there not also have to be a word (προσθιάζω ?) for having toothache in the front teeth ? (According to Hesychius, προσθιάζειν in fact means 'to pluck the eye brows'.) The noun γομφίος means a grinder or molar, and we should expect the verb to mean 'grind one's grinders'. But the real test is in the context. Ecclus. xxx. 10 contains a threat of what will happen to the man who pampers his son. It makes sense to say that he will end up by grinding his teeth, but not that his spoilt child will give him toothache in the back teeth. The other passage presents a different version of the same problem. BDB insists that the Hebrew verb ϊΐπρ means 'to be blunt, dull'. Thus the two dictionaries together give us a curiously un satisfactory choice of meanings for Ezekiel's proverb. The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children suffer either from toothache or from blunt teeth. Neither alternative has the cogency of the more familiar form. Thus the entry ought to run: 'grind one's teeth, LXX Si. 30. 10. 2. of the teeth, be set on edge, ibid. Ez. 18. 2.' To this we may add that no definition is offered for γομφίασμός in Amos iv. 6. The meaning of the Hebrew is still in dispute. But whatever the Hebrew may have meant, the translator took it to mean 'grinding of teeth'. 29. γραμματοίΐσαγωγεύϊ. LSJ—schoolmaster: governor, LXX De. 1. 15, al. One meaning of ε'ισαγωγεΐν is 'to give elementary instruction in'; hence the first definition. But, apart from two variants in Exodus, this word occurs only in four passages in Deuteronomy, and in all four the context has to do with the provision of judges and magistrates for the administration of justice. Now at Athens the eloαγωγεΰς was a court official responsible for the introduction of cases, and this must be the semantic contribution of that word to the monstrous compound used in the LXX. The contribution of γραμματο- is harder to determine. It could mean that the official was: (a) a scribe-magistrate; (b) a magis trate in charge of records; (e) a magistrate to deal with legal documents. The nearest English equivalent would seem to be 'recorder'. 30. γυρόω. LSJ—make round, ουρανό ν LXX Si. 43. 12. The verse cited runs: εγύρωσεν ούρανόν ev κυκλώσει 8όξης. The sub ject of the sentence is the rainbow, and neither Jesus ben Sira nor his</page><page sequence="14">466 G. Β. CAIRD grandson can have supposed that it was the rainbow that made the sky round. What they said was: 'it circles the sky with its brilliant arc'. But the same verb occurs with a slightly different meaning at Job xxvi. 10: πρόσταγμα πρόσταγμα όγύρωσΐν ίπΐ πρόσωπον ΰδατο? μεχρΐ συντΐλείας φωτός μΐτα σκότους. 'He has drawn a circular boundary on the face of the water at the place where light meets darkness.' So the required definition is: 'circle, LXX Si.Si. 43. 12; draw a circle, ibid. Jb. 26. 10'. 31. δεσμεύω. LSJ —fetter, put in chains ... II. lay snares for, LXX ι Ki. 24. 12. The Hebrew word is צדה, and LSJ has assumed that this comes from צוד, 'to hunt', and has then transferred this meaning to δεσμεύω. In fact, צדה comes from דה^, 'to lie in wait'. But all this is beside the point, because the Greek translator clearly read the word as צלר, and therefore used δεσμεύω in its normal sense. 32. δεΰρο. LSJ—hither ... 2. used as Interjection, come on! .. . d. later, go away, LXX 4 Ki. 3.13. The imperative of £1לך is often used in the full sense ('go!'), but often also in a weakened sense as a mild cohortative ('come now!'). In the second sense it is translated by δεύτε, but three times as often by δεύρο. In 4 Kingdoms iii. 13 לך has, no doubt, its full sense, but the translator assumed that he was dealing with it in the weakened sense. As a result he has produced an ellipsis, which would have to be trans lated: 'Come now! be off to your father's prophets!' But he never imagined that δεύρο could actually mean 'Go away!' 33. δευτερόω. LSJ—do the second time: repeat, λόγον LXX Si. 7. 14, al. 2. change, 0801■ ibid. Je. 2. 36. II. δ. τινί to give one a second blow, ibid, ι Ki. 26. 8: c. acc., τινά slay, ibid. 3 Ki. 21 (20). 20. The first definition given is all that is required for any of the passages cited. The translator of Jeremiah mistook שנה ('change') for ןז1ה ('do again'), but made excellent sense by so doing: 'Why have you been so contemptuous as to travel the same way a second time? You shall be shamed by Egypt as you were by Assyria.' In 1 Kingdoms xxvi. 8 the idea of striking a blow is in the contdit, not in the verb. Abishai says to David, '1 shall strike him to the ground with one blow of my spear and need not do it to him again.' The last case is more com plex. Here, in 3 Kingdoms xxi (xx). 20, the Hebrew has 'each struck his man', but the Greek has a longer version: ίπάταξ^ν ίκαστος τον</page><page sequence="15">TOWARDS A LEXICON OF THE SEPTUAGINT I 467 παρ' nap' παρ' αύτοΰ και εδευτερωσε ν έκαστος τον παρ' αύτοΰ. J. Α. Montgomery (The(The International Critical Commentary, ad 10c.) claims that εδευτέρωσεν is a marginal gloss, drawing the reader's attention to the fact that the scribe had accidentally repeated the phrase έκαστος τον παρ' αύτοΰ—'an early bit of textual criticism in a confused passage'. If so, εδεντερωσεν means 'he did it twice'. But the text is capable of translation as it stands: 'Each struck the man at his side and did it a second time.' But the verb itself does not mean 'to strike twice', let alone 'to slay'. 34. δήλος. LSJ—. . . III. δήλοι, oi, Urim, LXX 1 Ki. 28. 6, al. δηλωσις. LSJ—. . . 3. Urim, LXX Le. 8. 8. Both these words are used as renderings for אירים, just as αλήθεια, ασιάτης,ασιάτης, τελειάτης, are used as renderings for רן?!ים. Accordingly, LSJ gives 'Urim' as the meaning of both. But this is not quite accurate. The translators were not treating Urim and Thummim as proper nouns (for then they would simply have transliterated them), but as descriptive terms with a translatable meaning. They derived them (probably cor rectly), one from איר, 'to give light', and the other from וןמם, 'to be whole or complete'. In the LSJ entry under αλήθεια, this has been succinctly and adequately covered: 'symbol of truth... of the Thummim, LXX Le. 8. 8.' The entries under δήλος and δήλωσις should be emended to conform to this pattern ('symbol of revelation, of the Urim, etc.'), and a similar entry is required for άσιότης and τελειάτης. 35■ διάγγελμα. LSJ—a message, notice, LXX 3 Ki. 4. 20 (7). Read '3 Ki. 4. 20 (5.7)'. The third translator of Kingdoms is given to stilted translation, but even he can hardly have supposed that it was the task of Solomon's officers to supply monthly notices for his table. The Hebrew has פל־הקןךב, 'all the guests'; but the translator read this as ל־ה^רוא^, and took it to mean 'everything called for or ordered'; i.e. they supplied, as we should say, all the orders for the king's table. 36. διαδιδράσκω. LSJ—run away, escape . . . 3 ■fly in all directions, LXX 2 Ma. 8. 13. There is no justification for making a special case out of this passage in 2 Maccabees. The men simply deserted or ran away. 37. διανήθω. LSJ—in pf. part. Pass, -νενησμενος, spin out, LXX Ex.Ex. 35. 6. But 'to spin out' is always in English used metaphorically, meaning 'to prolong or protract'; and in all four passages where διανενησμενος appears, it refers literally to scarlet thread. 38. διαστολή. LSJ—. . . δ. χελεων parting of the lips, i.e. utterance, LXX Nu. 30. 7.</page><page sequence="16">468 G. Β. CAIRD The underlying Hebrew word is מ5טא, a rash utterance. The verb טא^ occurs in Lev. v. 4, and there the Greek has διαστε'λλειν χείλεσι, for which LSJ gives a special entry: '4. pronounce'. This is adequate, though not exact. The regular meanings of διάστελλε׳״ are 'to separate', 'to distinguish', 'to define precisely', 'to give precise orders'; and the meaning required in Lev. v. 4 is 'to make an explicit statement'. In the papyri διαστολή is commonly used of a memorandum or other written notification or instruction (see Moulton and Milligan, The Vocabulary of the the Greek Testament, p. 154). It follows, then, that διαστολή χειλε'ων avrfjs will be 'her explicit (verbal) statement'; and that it is merely false etymology to suggest that the literal meaning is 'parting of the lips'. 39. διαφωνέω. LSJ—. . . 3. fail to answer roll-calls, desert, LXX Ex. 24. 11, al. This definition gives tolerable sense in Exod. xxiv. 11 and Num. xxxi. 49, but no sense at all in 1 Kingdoms xxx. 19, where ού διεφώνησεν avrotsavrots means 'they found nothing missing', 'nothing was lost to them', or in Judith x. 13, where it is a question of soldiers being lost by capture or death. The meaning 'to be missing or lost' is well attested both for things and for persons. Thus it is possible to translate Exod. xxiv. 11: 'of the picked men of Israel not one was missing'. But, in view of the evidence presented by Moulton and Milligan (op. cit.), it more probably means 'not one perished'. It is generally recognized that the translator has deliberately altered the sense to avoid the anthropomorphism of the Hebrew, which reads: 'he did not lay a hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; they beheld God, and ate and drank'. For 'they beheld God' the Greek has 'they appeared in the place of God'; but even that was recognized to be a risky experience. 40. διαψιθυρίζω. LSJ—whisper ... II. whisper among themselves, LXX Si.Si.Si.Si. 12. 18, Plb. 15. 26. 8, Luc. Gall. 25. The Ecclesiasticus reference is misplaced. The word is used in a description of a man's enemy who can be relied upon to spread malicious gossip. There is no question of several people whispering together. 41. δικαιοσύνη. LSJ—righteousness, justice ... 2. fulfilment of the Law, LXX Is. 26. 2, al.; Ev. Matt. 3. 15, al. The second definition arises from the confusion of connotation and denotation. It cannot be inserted into the text of the Greek Isaiah, which runs: Xaos φυλάσσω ν δικαιοσυνών και φυλάσσων άληθααν. Even if the translator held that righteousness consisted in keeping the Law, this does not mean that keeping the Law was for him part of the definition of δικαιοσύνη. The phrase should be translated: 'a people that preserves justice and truth'.</page><page sequence="17">TOWARDS A LEXICON OF THE SEPTUAGINT I 469 42. έγκατάλειμμα. LSJ—remnant, residue, trace ... 3. kneading trough, LXXLXX De. 28. 5, 17. For the Hebrew of Deut. xxviii. 5 the RV, followed by RSV, gives: 'Blessed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough', which is a reasonable guess, though the derivation and meaning of משאלת ('kneading-trough') are far from certain. LSJ has simply transferred to εγκατάλειμμαεγκατάλειμμα the conjectural meaning of its Hebrew counterpart. The editors would have done better to follow the Vulgate ('Benedicta horrea tua et benedictae reliquiae tuae') or even the AV ('Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store'), both of which have been guided by the LXX. The Greek translators of the Pentateuch did not understand 5!שאךת. At Exod. viii. 3 (vii. 28) and xii. 34 they rendered it by φύραμα, 'dough', possibly supposing it to be derived from שאר, 'leaven'. At Deut. xxviii. 5, 17 they clearly derived it from ΊΧψ, 'to remain, be left over', and perhaps even read it as שארית. Thus their version—ευλογημένοι al άττοθηκαίάττοθηκαί σου καϊ τα εγκαταλεΐμματά σου—would have to be trans lated: 'Blessings on what you save up and on what you leave over.' 43. έγκαταλοχίζω. LSJ—divide into relays or courses, LXX 2 Ch. 31.18. By derivation καταλοχίζω means 'to divide into λόχοι or companies'; and LSJ has assumed that this is also the meaning of the double com pound. But the definition given does not fit the context, which describes, not a new assignment of priests to courses, but their enrolment by genealogy. The noun καταλογισμό? had lost its precise, etymological meaning and had come to be used of any enrolment or register. The verb εγκαταλοχίζω is not a strengthened form of καταλοχίζω, but a de nominative from καταλοχισμό?, meaning 'to enter names in a register'. 44. έγκαυχάομαι. LSJ—pride oneself on, εν τινι LLLXX Ps. 73 (74). 4. This definition would fit any of the other three passages in which the verb is found, but not the one cited. There the verb is used absolutely, meaning 'to exult or gloat', and the iv introduces an adverbial clause of circumstance: και ενεκαυχησαντο οι μισοϋντές σε iv μέσω της εορτής σου. 45· έγκεντρίζω. LSJ—goad, spur on, LXX Wi. 16. χι (Pass.). In this context the word is in fact used literally of the bites of in sects and snakes. 46. εγκισσάω. LSJ—have yearnings like one pregnant, LXX Ge. 30. 38. There is a widespread belief that pregnant women have compulsive yearnings for particular foods; but this must be the only place where such yearnings have been attributed to pregnant sheep. If the translators had thought that this was the only meaning of the verb, they would 621.2 η h</page><page sequence="18">470 G. Β. CAIRD hardly have used it five times to describe sheep in the breeding season. Compare the use of κισσάν, meaning 'to conceive' in Ps. 1 (li). 5. 47. έγκρατεύομαι. LSJ—exercise self-control. . . force oneself to do a thing, ι Ki. 13. 12. The Hebrew verb דזתאפק means 'to restrain oneself', and in this sense is rendered by ίγκρατεΰΐσθαί in Gen. xliii. 31. In 1 Sam. xiii. 12 the context is generally thought to require a slightly different meaning. Saul tells Samuel that, because he feared that the Philistines would overtake him before Samuel had arrived to offer sacrifice, '1 felt myself compelled to offer the burnt offering myself.' But it should be noted that the regular meaning of the Hebrew verb would fit the context quite well: '1 kept my head and offered the burnt offering myself.' This at least is what the Greek translator thought the Hebrew meant, and he has accordingly used Ιγκρατΐύεσθαι, in its normal sense. 48. εγχειρίδιον. LSJ—hand-knife, dagger ... 4. tool, implement, LXX Ex.Ex. 20. 25. The tool concerned is one used for shaping a building stone, and the Hebrew word is 10"ב. The translator has therefore used εγχειρίδιον in its usual sense of 'knife'. 49. εκτείνω. LSJ—stretch out... extend the line of an army ... V. intr. draw draw along, LXX Jd. 20. 37. This otherwise quite inexplicable definition has simply been lifted from the AV or RV. To make matters worse, the Hebrew verb which the AV translates as 'drew themselves along' is not the one which the LXX translates by εκτείνω. According to the Hebrew text, the ambush broke from cover in the direction of Gibeah and then converged on the town. In other words they deployed, which is a perfectly intelligible meaning for the Greek verb also. 50. έμτταγή. LSJ—suretyship, Sm. Pr. 11. 15. The verb ונקע means 'to thrust, clap, give a blast', and its special legal meaning, 'to go surety', is derived from the practice of striking hands with a man at the conclusion of a bargain (2 Kings x. 15; Prov. vi. 1, xvii. 18, xxii. 26). None of the Greek translators understood this practice. The LXX read the word as תקע, 'a horn-blast', and produced a rendering very wide of the Hebrew. How Symmachus understood the couplet is less clear, since only half of his rendering has survived. There are two possibilities. One is that he resorted to etymology and left the sense to look after itself. ונקע is used of driving in tent-pegs, and in this sense could be well translated by έμπηγνυμι. But this method was more typical of Aquila than of Symmachus (according to Jerome,</page><page sequence="19">TOWARDS A LEXICON OF THE SEPTUAGINT I 471 it was the principle of Aquila 'verbum de verbo exprimere' and of Symmachus 'sensum potius sequi'). The other possibility is that Symmachus misread the Hebrew as מו?ן#ים, and that εμπαγη is a strengthened form of πάγη, 'a trap'. There are three reasons for thinking that this may be so. The laqueos of the Vulgate is best explained as an attempt to follow Symmachus. Symmachus almost certainly knew and used Theodotion's version, which here reads: και μισών παγώΐυθήναι πεποιθήσει. And this meaning gives excellent sense, even if it is not the sense of the Hebrew: 'the man who goes surety for a stranger suffers for it, but the man who dislikes traps has a quiet mind.' 51. cpirveuais. LSJ—on-breathing, LXX Ps. 17 (18). 16. When one is endeavouring to translate a Greek text into English, it is disconcerting to be offered a word not recognized in the Oxford English Dictionary.Dictionary. 52. ένδιαβάλλω. LSJ—calumniate ... 2. stand in the way as an adver sary,sary, LXX Nu. 22. 22. The second definition as it stands is overloaded. The Hebrew equi valent, ל?&gt;טן, means simply 'as an adversary'. The Greek verb is the normal rendering of 'to accuse', and this is probably the reason why it has been chosen here to represent the cognate noun. But even this does not by itself determine its meaning in this context. Hellenistic Greek had a fondness for double compounds, which, like the English 'face up to' or 'meet up with', did not necessarily add anything to the meaning of the simpler verb. The likelihood is that e'νδιαβάλλειν is here being used as a more emphatic form of διαβάλλειν, especially as the same Hebrew word occurs again ten verses later and is rendered by tls διαβοληνδιαβολην σον. But one of the attested meanings of διαβάλλειν is 'to divert from a course or purpose', and this meaning fits the present context admirably. 53. «νδοξάζομαι. LSJ—Pass., to be glorified, ev τινι LXX Ex. 14. 4, al. This word raises a question of great complexity, which I must deal with in full at a later date. In all languages there are words which are used with both an objective and a subjective sense, to describe both the cause which evokes response and the response so evoked: wonder, honour, glory, horror, and the like. Also in Greek there are verbs which are passive in form, but which in meaning may be either true passive (the action is done to the subject by another agent) or intransitive (the action is done by the subject). Thus όρ&amp;σθαι can mean 'to be seen' or 'to appear'; and γιγνώσκεσθαι can mean 'to be known' or 'to make one self known'. LSJ treats ενδοξάζεσθαι as a true passive. But it could in stead be an intransitive, derived from the adjective ένδοξος, and meaning</page><page sequence="20">472 G. Β. CAIRD 'to be or show oneself glorious'. When God says (Ezek. xxxviii. 23) άγιασθησομαιάγιασθησομαι και όνδοξασθήσομαι, does this mean '1 shall be hallowed and honoured (sc. by men)' or '1 shall display my sanctity and splendour'? 54· ένεξουσιάζω. LSJ—show independence in . . . 2. exert authority, be supreme supreme in . . . II. Med., usurp authority, LXX Si. 20. 8. The idea of usurpation is imported into the context. The couplet is a warning against garrulity. The man in question has the right to be heard, but abuses it by speaking too long, and so makes himself un popular. 'Stand on one's rights' would come nearer to the meaning, as well as being nearer to other attested uses of the verb. 55. ένσκολιεύομαι. LSJ-—catch in a snare, LXX Jb. 40. 19 (24). The word is derived from σκολιός, 'curved, crooked, twisted', and it is not plain how the transition could have been made from the root meaning to that given above, unless by way of a bent pin. LSJ has simply assumed that the Greek is an accurate translation of the Hebrew. Unfortunately the Hebrew of this verse in the description of the croco dile is notoriously corrupt. The rendering of the RSV, for example, depends on a conjectural emendation of the first line of the couplet: 'Can one take him with hooks, or pierce his nose with a snare?' The Greek translator (this is one of the passages in Job supplied from Theo dotion) had a Hebrew text much the same as our MT and dealt with its problems by a simple word-for-word rendering. Thus the first line of the couplet, עיניו ךקןחבר?, becomes iv τω όφθαλμω αύτοΰ δόξΐται αυτόν. This is difficult, and can hardly be translated at all unless we assume that the crocodile is still, as in the last sentence, the subject: 'he is con fident that Jordan will batter against his mouth; will he receive it in his eye (sc. turn his face to the current) ?' We must therefore try to make sense of the following line with the crocodile as subject: όνσκολ ΐΐυόμενος τρώσει ρίνα. The Hebrew has במודים ימןב״אף, but there is a high degree of probability that the translator read the first word as במ^יןשים and took it to mean 'by his twistings'. Thus the whole verse by a little stretch of meaning is made to yield the sense: 'Will he turn his face into the current? By twisting and turning will he keep his nose clear?' (or better still, omit the question marks). 56. έξέρπω. LSJ—creep out of... II. generally, go out . . . III. trans., make make to come forth, produce, βατράχους LXX Ps. 104 (105). 30. It is unlikely that the translator of the Psalter intended to use this word in the colourless way suggested. The equivalent Hebrew word (רץ^) means 'to swarm', and it takes a direct object. By a fairly natural extension of meaning the translator has made the Greek verb do the same. His translation is not normal Greek syntax, any more than it</page><page sequence="21">TOWARDS A LEXICON OF THE SEPTUAGINT I 473 would be normal English to say 'their land swarmed frogs', but his meaning is clear enough: the place was crawling with them. 57. επαγωγή. LSJ—... 7. leading away into captivity, captivity, LXX Is.Is. 14. 17: generally, distress, misery, ibid. Si. 23. 14 (pi.), cf. Hsch. The general meaning of 'trouble' is attested in eight passages in Ecclesiasticus and one in Deuteronomy. In view of the well-established tendency of the translator of Isaiah to depart from the sense of the Hebrew almost at whim, there is no need to look for a more precise meaning for the word in the two passages in which he uses it. 58. επαρμα. LSJ—something raised, a swelling ... II. metaph., elation, vanity vanity ... b. in good sense, elevation ... 2. height, LXX 2 Es. 6. 3. Even if the last definition were correct, it would surely be misplaced among the metaphorical senses of the word, since the passage has to do with the rebuilding of the temple. But 'height' cannot be correct, since νφοςνφοςνφος is the next word in the sentence. The Aramaic word means 'foun dations', and the translator knew this and used επαρμα to denote the raised platform on which the temple was to be built. 59. έπίβλημα. LSJ—. . . II. that which is put on, piece of embroidery . . . mantle, LXX Is. 3. 22. Isaiah's list of fashionable women's wear is not easy to identify in Hebrew, and one glance at the Greek, which includes the phrase διαφανή Λακωνικά,Λακωνικά, is enough to show that the translator has not attempted any antiquarian reconstruction. As is often the case with this translator, he has preferred to get Isaiah's gist and give the contemporary equivalent. Thus for 'gowns, cloaks, shawls, and purses' (if this is what the Hebrew means) he has substituted τά ττΐριπόρφυρα και τά μΐσοπόρφυρα και τα ΐπιβλήματαΙπιβλήματαΙπιβλήματα τά κατά την ο'ικίαν—'dresses edged with purple or shot with purple and garments worn about the house'. Presumably the modern equivalent for the last phrase would be house-coats or negliges. The Greek translator of Isaiah had some odd, anti-bourgeois ideas, but even he can hardly have supposed that well-to-do ladies wore their mantles indoors, or that such a practice would have been evidence of vicious self-indulgence. 60. έπιλαλέω. LSJ—interrupt in speaking, Sm. Ps. 122 (123). 4. This at least has the merit of giving picturesque sense. The psalmist is made to complain that he is tired of being constantly interrupted by the well-to-do. It is possible also to detect the reasoning by which this definition has been reached. 'Επί in compounds can have the sense of 'in addition'; and, if the well-to-do spoke in addition to the psalmist,</page><page sequence="22">474 G· ®- CAIRD they could hardly help interrupting him. But e'm in compounds can also mean 'against'; and is it not more likely that the psalmist would object to detraction than to mere interruption ? This interpretation would also be closer to the Hebrew, which speaks of the scorn of the prosperous. 61. «πίπληξίξ. LSJ—blame, rebuke ... 2. in strong sense, punishment, LXX 2 Ma. 7. 33. This reference is misplaced. The words are spoken by the last of the seven brothers to suffer torture at the hands of Antiochus, but the point is that he makes light of these horrors and treats them as the mild cen sure of the Lord. 62. έφύβριστος. LSJ—wanton, insolent... II. Pass., contemptible, LXX Wi.Wi.Wi. 17. 7. The word occurs in the description of the confusion in Egypt imme diately prior to the Exodus; but it is used, not in a unique passive sense to denote the contemptible arts of the Egyptian magicians, but in the normal active sense to denote the contemptuous dismissal of these arts by the judgement of God. 63. θάλασσα. LSJ—sea ... 4. channel, LXX 3 Ki. 18. 32. 5. χαλκή θ.θ. laver, ibid. 2 Ki. 8. 8. These two entries illustrate two very different points. In the first θάλασσα θάλασσα θάλασσα is used to translate the moat or trench round Elijah's rebuilt altar. There is in the Lucianic text a variant θααλα, which is simply a transliteration of the Hebrew; and Rahlfs (Septuagintastudien, 3. 285) claims that this is the original reading, which later scribes turned into θάλασσα. The other and more likely possibility is that θάλασσα is original and is an example of the common phenomenon of homoeophony —the choice of a Greek word because of some similarity in sound to the Hebrew. But in either case the passage can hardly be said to have contributed something new to the dictionary meaning of θάλασσα. The second entry is a simple confusion. In Solomon's temple there stood a bronze sea and ten lavers. The lavers were functional, but the sea was purely symbolic, representing the cosmic sea of the creation myth. In ι Kings viii. 23-39 these are clearly distinguished, and equally clearly distinguished in the advance reference which the LXX has introduced into the account of David's conquests (the passage cited). The confusion is as old as the Chronicler (2 Chron. iv. 6); but that hardly justifies it. 64. θερμαστρίς. LSJ—tongs . . . III. = θΐρμαντηρ . . . LXX 3 Ki. 7. 26 ·(45) 31 י(ג&gt;4) ΘΐρμαντηρΘΐρμαντηρ is defined as 'kettle or pot for boiling water'. But the Hebrew word rendered by θΐρμαστρίς is V?, which always denotes some sort of fire-iron.</page><page sequence="23">TOWARDS A LEXICON OF THE SEPTUAGINT I 475 65. θερμός. LSJ—hot. . . III. το θ., = θερμότης, heat... 3. θερμόν, τό, grace, favour,grace, favour, Θ. εΰρεΐν εν ερημω LXX Je. 38 (31). 2. The Hebrew is :Πζΐ ־Τא חן 33!ך?ר #־^—'the people who survived the sword found grace in the wilderness.' The Greek reads: εΰρονεΰρονεΰρον θΐρμόν iv ερτήμω μετα όλωλότων iv μαχαίρα. At first sight it seems as if the translator has just mistaken ]Π, 'grace', for ΒΠ, 'warmth*. But on closer examination it appears that the text he is translating differs from the MT at no less than four points: :nr! שדודי QV ן1ןיאתי חם 3?ןךןיר—Ί found him warm (sc. Israel, still alive) in the desert along with those who had been killed by the sword.' 66. θύρωμα. LSJ—. . . doorway . . . III. window, LXX 3 Ki. 7. 42 (5) (Pi·)· We can trace the lineage of this misbegotten entry to an untrans latable Greek rendering of a corrupt Hebrew text. No reconstruction of the text, however, gives any warrant for supposing that θνρωμα meant anything other than 'doorway'. G. B. Caird When this article was already in proof, the new Supplement to LSJ (1968) came to hand, bringing with it a wealth of new material, which all students of Greek will welcome and applaud. Much of this, no doubt, will be indirectly relevant to the lexicography of the LXX. There are some new Septuagintal entries, which I have not yet had time to examine in detail. Of the entries I have commented on above, three have been corrected as I should have wished (γλυπτός, διάγγελμα, and εγκισσάω); three have been deleted (άκριβασμός, αναφορά, and εγκατάλειμμα);εγκατάλειμμα); and three have been modified (άνθεμιον, άντίον, and διαφωνεω).διαφωνόω). There is also an important correction under επαγωγή, which makes no difference to my criticism, but which may well be relevant to LXX usage. G. B. C. G. Β. Caird</page></plain_text>
