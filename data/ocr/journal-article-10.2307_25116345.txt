<plain_text><page sequence="1">Murphy I in Missouri Mark Costello I It's 1 AM on Sunday night, first day of September. Murphy sit sat poolside in a blacked out Holiday Inn in Columbia, Missouri. In room 126 he has a son and a wife. In North East Iowa he has a girl friend. In Manhattan, Kansas, he has a new job. In his right hand he has a half-emptied pint of tequila. Murphy drinks because he doesn't know what else to do. If he didn't love his family, he would go in and tell them that he was leaving, that they would never see him again. If he didn't love Annie, he would go in and sleep with his smart wife, he would mount her and ready them both to drive non-stop to smiling Manhattan tomorrow. As it is, he can do neither. So he drinks and thinks it over; he remembers Annie and a summer of playing her sweet and tentative ass off the six year old question of his marriage. He first saw her in a classroom that stunk with worry, that glittered with dandruff and florescene. She stood against a blackboard with a typed paper in her hand and explained to Murphy, her teacher, why she hadn't gotten her bibliography in on time. Three months later, stuffed with pizza and tequila, he leaned under the hot, canned dome of a phone booth, jammed the receiver into his cheek for support, dialed her number and told her he loved her. It took him seven months to arm that lie. By then his favorite trick was to lay a big, vermilion ear against her ribs and whisper, "Annie I love you," listening quietly as the sense of it boomed against the chili scorched roof of his mouth, the steaming ceilings of his trumpeting marriage. She was from Des Moines and her blouses were made of oxford cloth and paid for by her father. Her auburn hair roared over her bare shoul ders, and she didn't believe a word Murphy said. But above him her milky teeth shone against the wide blue inane of Iowa in June; they tickled each other and gal loped through dandelions. On the morning of her last exam, with his fingertips still puckered from doing the breakfast dishes, Murphy presented her with big red beads from Nigeria. At home that afternoon, with his integral wife smok ing the small cigars he foisted off on her, feckless Murphy sat with his hands in a swoon and read the letter that confirmed his fat assistant professorship in Kansas come September. He stuffed his hands in his pocket and pretended to help her budget for the new year that faced them. They should have had hatchets in their hands, doors should have been slamming, Kan sas should have gone away. But it wouldn't, so they told each other how much it would cost, how much they could spend on it. He poured tequila into a Mason jar, and as he tipped it up, he saw his wife's reflection in the glass-topped kitchen table. She looked postponed and hollow-eyed. But Murphy wasn't quite willing to let it go at that. Fervid with Jose Cuervo and his four year old son screaming around his knees like a delphic gnat he would give his life for, he chose that moment to ask himself why bright Annie would fool with a married man like him. Because it was a question he couldn't afford to ask himself, his timing was perfect. He had no more gotten it into his mind than his son screamed: "Swing me!" He did. And the question of Annie fit his son's grin with such centripetal occlusion, Murphy shouted with joy, his fingers strummed his son's ribs with the im punity of the loon under the penalty of death. Annie called him early the next morning to tell him that she had gotten an "A" in Spanish. Murphy burst out of his sulphuric office with a half-gallon of Rose wine in a paper bag. The ineluctable inscape of stagger ing Iowa hung over the back of their necks; crows hop ped between the blue-black furrows of beanfields, green and yellow tractors were bent over backward against opal spumes of cloud. Annie caught him by the hand and led him to the banks of the gurgling, minnow crowded Coon River. There she sat in her wine skirt with her feet together and her knees drawn up, while the river made a de manding racket dragging itself southward. He looked down at her ankles shaved the same color as his own overwrought cheeks and he didn't want her to marry anyone else. The air above the river was cataleptic with swallows; he wanted to snatch one down and dry his hands on it. Instead he said, "Annie I love you," and his asser tion was contained neither by his mouth nor his mar riage nor the vast blue sky over his head. It flew off like a blasphemy that was both irretractable and air conditioned. Sweat trickled down his ribs and because he had said it once too often already, he told her again that he loved her and put his hands on her breasts. When he got home that afternoon, his wife was chew ing on the eraser of a yellow pencil and wincing at the black cigar smoke that wreathed her beautiful, Bohunk face. She stood up and asked him please to look for a summer construction job first thing Monday morning. He made a muscle, his son felt how hard it was, and his wife presented him with the week's grocery list. He bowed and clicked his heels when he took it and his wife walked away from him. She had anxiety attacks 14 The North American Review</page><page sequence="2">and couldn't breathe when she turned a super-market aisle that turned away from home. So Murphy never asked her to grocery shop for herself anymore. The farmhouse he borrowed that last Sunday had a lawnful of willows that flicked and sizzled with a nuptial greenery. The razor grass bowed and whispered as he passed with Annie's tremulous arm in his hand. Big dolt Murphy looked up at the blowing sky and dreamed they had been wed by sly proxy, in windy and carna tion-strewn Des Moines . . . Strange mortgage. Tolling quiet. Tenant Murphy was playing house in hell again. Annie's hair pins glit tered against the sheet, her hair fanned out over the pillow. Next to the bed there was a straight-backed chair. A package of rubbers was nailed to it with a crooked spike of sunlight. At 6 AM on Monday morning Murphy was sitting in the Labor Hall, waist-deep in spittoons and old American Legion magazines, waiting for a summer job. Half an hour later he lifted a forty-pound cement block with a bang to the floor and the examination of his conscience began. $ He had failed in the farmhouse with Annie and now with the tin Iowa sun clattering against the slick, blind ing limestone above him, he could admit it. Between Annie's uplifted knees he had gone soft as a night crawl er, and now his teeth were glittering in the sun, there was sweat in his eyes, the dank palms of his hands were being cut on the sharp edges of the cement block, but he was picking them up and putting them down and he had found a place that was proper to his rage and hu miliation. Whoopee. He worked with an astounded old chick en hawk name of Fred who had the ears of a bat way up the back of his neck. Fred screamed around with permanent saliva caked on his faded mouth and didn't remind Murphy in the least of pressing his closed eyes against Annie's breasts?every sighing, willing surface of her body was a promise that had been made to him so long ago that Murphy couldn't now spoil it with his softness. He pressed against her, he whispered that he loved her, and each time he said it, he got in softer and softer debt to her and whole house with pigeons stut tering and clucking across the attic above them so mer rily. Oh no old Fred was a regular running heart attack with the arms of a bat, too. All tendons and pale bones with no bicep at all. Yet with his piebald pigeon's face concave with pain, he'd get on his tip toes and lead Murphy into terrible slick blue corners and tell him to hand blocks up to him, when from the floor over head the red acetylene popcorn of the welder's torches was bursting and sizzling on the concrete deck around them. But Fred's skin didn't seem to burn and he didn't seem to care about the mean rubies falling on his shoulders and on the tips of his kitty-kat ears. So Murphy would cringe and lift and it didn't remind him at all of pressing against Annie in that squeaking beige sink of a bed when after awhile he refused to open his eyes and began to hears his son running through the rooms downstairs. He built to such a shrieking momentum, Murphy knew he was going to fall against the stove or the bathtub or the glass-topped coffee table and really get hurt. Why didn't his flippant, coffee-sipping mother stop them, why was she torturing him this way? Finally in the empty corridors and rooms of his skull Murphy screamed: "You stop running do you hear your father?" But he didn't stop running. And old Fred didn't either. One afternoon in his hurry he almost nudged Murphy off the hoist they were unloading on the fourth floor. Murphy cursed the deck Fred walked on and set a block down so hard on a scaffold, it broke in half. Fred looked at him and said, "Boy, I believe you would fuck up a wet dream if you got the chance." Foreshortened, profane, apt, the ac cusation was as unforgettable as it was unforgiveable. Murphy was almost thirty years and there was nothing further from a wet dream than magnificent and tentative Annie. So he took Fred's pale arm and shook it. He said, "You don't know what you're talking about old man. You better shut your mouth." As he looked into Fred's watery, unflinching eyes, Murphy tried to remember what Annie looked like. When he couldn't, he smashed his ungloved fist against a concrete wall and cursed until he was determined to see her again even sooner than he had promised. Later that afternoon Fred hurt his back lifting a slab of limestone and Murphy bought a crazy, cortisone colored hard hat from the foreman and smoked three black cigars. When he got home after dark his wife was sitting in the bathtub, her head hung down and her hair stream ing into rings of dead water. Murphy reeked of tequila and his nose was stuffed with concrete dust. When he bent over and asked her what was the matter, she said, "Ahhh," three times. Three days later she was stretched out on an operat ing table, having a tumor taken off her bladder. Post operative hugs and paddy-cake. Murphy hung around the dis-infected pedestal of his wife's bed as nice and fuddled as a new father. Both of her room mates were old ladies with cancer and sons killed in the Korean war. Their distraught daughters would rush in from time to time and try to keep the old ladies in bed while they reported the fatal illness of other and still younger daughters in Texas and Detroit. Outside, the big purple storm clouds piled up, draped rainwater like depraved rayon nightgowns over the March, 1966 15</page><page sequence="3">windows and Murphy was sure he would not work the next day. So he said to his wife: "Sure I'll work tomorrow. I'm in with the foreman, I'll work inside. He knows I need the money." That afternoon they held hands and talked about how they'd been treating each other. He brought his wife chocolate malteds and they promised to try to help and love each other in spite of their complications and problems. Her urine was syphening into a plastic bag at the side of the bed, and she seemed brave and distinct in her new madras bathrobe. Time and again he squeezed her hand and told her that the biopsy would come back from the lab negative. Of course the tumor couldn't be cancerous. She shouldn't even consider it. She was much too young. His kissed his wife's hand at four Sunday afternoon, called Annie from the phone booth in the lobby of the hospital and told her he was on his way. 10 minutes later he took off for Des Moines through squalls of blue Iowa rain. What would happen if one of them hit him head on? Again and again to the drowsy, imperial rhythm of his deranged windshield wipers, Murphy tried to consider the impact of a 60-ton, 70 mile an hour semi-trailer truck on the sweet frame of his face and Chevrolet. Each time he thought of it, the word "impact" was driv en with all of its anthropomorphic pat-pat right through his soft brown eyes and wound up amid pulverized glass and grillwork a mile back down the road where no new word for the indestructability of matter would rise out of his aghast corpse and edify the onlookers. That morbidity and his squacking, carbon-belching Chevrolet got him into Des Moines, but not into Annie. She came knocking three times at his door, and when he kissed her and let her in, Murphy got a requisite look at the motel parking lot. It was rife with wives on brave vacations. Bold fathers stood on hairy tip toes unloading the luggage racks of side-swiped station wagons from Minnesota, Utah, and Nebraska. Skinny sons in willing t-shirts carried suitcases with arms drawn and shoulder sockets squeaking. Ramingo daughters in shorts and pin curls carried folding cots and large, stained sackfuls of ham burgers to go. From dad on down they deserved this vacation, and now with the sun setting they could sali vate and co-operate like troops of blood-line saints with twilight in their comfortable, death-risking eyes. Murphy slammed the door, stripped Annie and led her into the bed. But there, within the rehearsed fork of her knees, he felt a width and consent that were cru cial. She was giving him his second chance and as he knelt and nibbled on her thighs, he could taste the lies he had told his wife about the remoteness of work to morrow and cancer in a couple of days. The were lies that could be annuled inside Annie alone, not be tween the sheets or on the highway. Murphy lay a vigilant cheek on Annie's belly and tried to listen to the brave logic of his right middle finger as it moved in and out of her. But he could hear or feel nothing more than the knuckles and jab of a virtuosity that Annie had felt before. Cursing, he reached to the night stand, ripped open a package of rubbers, rolled one on, pushing himself against her, and his impotency, the flamboyant and sheathed Tootsie Roll of his rage, hacked softly against Annie and there was no place to be but inside her. Cringing within that certainty Murphy said, "I want to be in you Annie," and each time he repeated his words, he was certain only that his softness was rubbing his wife's tumor wrong, that if he kept it up that tumor would bloom and flower in the lab and on her bladder and that despite the 150 heroic miles he had driven, he could still kill his wife by soft proxy, all the way from diaphonous and dare-devil Des Moines. Scared Murphy threw himself off her and said, "An nie this is no good. We're going to have to wait a min ute." More shrill than the clapboard farmhouse of his first failure, that plea squatted on his chest and screamed so loud for an explanation, Murphy knew he couldn't give it. So he touched her cheek and told Annie he was sorry. With nuptial gravity she turned and said, "It's all right. I understand." Because he was certain she didn't, he sat up on one elbow and asked her what she understood. "I understand that you think I'm a child. A little girl you can't be responsible for." Under the fragrant auspices of her breasts and di minution, Murphy kissed and corrected her until he had time to decide why they had to wait a minute. Then he reached up, swiped the ripped package of rubbers off the night stand and said: "This is why we have to wait a minute. I hate these things. They come between us, make us temporary and craven." Ducking under his speech, he buried his face in Annie's shoulder and she asked him to look up at her. When he didn't she said: "You don't want to make me pregnant do you?" Murphy shook his head. "No I don't. I want to make decent love to you though. And I can't with one of these on." In the space between her reply and her heaving shoul der blades, Murphy thought about making Annie preg 16 The North American Review</page><page sequence="4">nant. He thought about ripping the rubber off and pin ning her on the banks of the loud Coon River. She would squirm whispering: "You don't want to make me pregnant do you?" and Murphy would say: "Yes I want to make you pregnant," and she'd rasp: "All right go ahead then, oh go ahead." With a thrust and shutter Murphy would obey her order, engender a fix that he couldn't get out of, strike a blow that would devastate his wife and his marriage, that would keep him out of Kansas and his future there forever. Just loud enough to hear himself think, Murphy be gan to whisper: "Change my life Annie, change my life." He whispered it until he began to feel hard and sad about the distance that would always lay between what Annie could give and what he could take from her for the first time in her moist virgin's life. For the first time in either of their lives, sheathed and steady Murphy moved into Annie and her cry was con tained by the valved advocacy of his opened mouth and thrusting tongue. Humility and gratitude. He moved up on her, deep er into her, and the difference between Annie and his wife was thunderstruck, diametric and clutching; the young and moist decimals of her vagina gripped him and Murphy went as deep as Annie did. Reaching that end, he withdrew and found it again and again until he wanted to scream for the pelvic cinch and kiss she gave him. When she began to moan "Oh", Murphy felt infinitely penetrant, as if by length alone he could drive back and undo every tumor, marriage or woman he had ever made before her. Tears in the bone. He took Annie's face in his hands and saw his dream skull in hers. He kissed her eye sockets and like a spiral of splinters, swallows and fam ine, his spine took hold of hers and wouldn't let go short of fusion. He looked at her and she told him that she loved him. Two days and 150 miles later his wife didn't have cancer and all summer long Murphy lifted concrete blocks onto ringing scaffolding and paid Annie's bus fare to come see him. Broad Sunday afternoons they lay under a friend's skylight, in a friend's low bed, breathed the air-con ditioning, ate dexamyl and drank tequila. While pi geons wheeled over the back of his head, Murphy pulled his mouth off Annie's mouth and told her that he loved her, that he wanted to keep on loving her, that he didn't want to stop just to go to Kansas and to pieces with no one out there to love and live for. Monday mornings dawned resonant with jack-ham mers and disbelief. Full of his wife's bacon, eggs and blueberry pie, stout Murphy would lean and yawn in the cool caves of the unfinished fourth floor. He'd smoke a cigar and look down on razor-backed Fred scurrying in the muddy arroyo below him, racing amid the ghostly boa constrictors the tires of the wheelbar rows left behind. Then the big neuralgia of the air compressors would rack on and Murphy could feel, but couldn't believe the waltz of his and Annie's skeletons as they fleshed and coalesced while they screamed "love" and the Sunday sun sank to the squack of the bed, faded to the blue hiss of her bus leaving for Des Moines. Now Murphy stands in the Holiday Inn and looks out over the suitcases and luggage racks of the republic. He thinks of his last desperate promises to take Annie to Mexico. He thinks of a brave new station wagon with her fragrant combs and sun glasses spread across the top of dashboard. Roaring semi-trailer trucks might blare their horns and bright lights at them, but behind the tinted glass, amid the air-conditioning, she would be asleep with her head on Murphy's lap, and he would stroke moist wisps of hair from the corners of her mouth and together they would drive to that serene southern border in less than two days. Annie. Murphy raises the pint of tequila to his lips and his anger is as amnesiac as it is drunken. He lowers the bottle, puts the tips of his fingers to his chin, but no matter how quietly he stands, he cannot remember what she looks like. That loss of memory turns him on his heel. With raw tequila sloshing on the toes of his shoes, he heads to ward room 126 and his hands remember yesterday. At first he sat on the front porch, drank beer, jiggled his son on his knees and declined his wife's invitation to help the truck driver load the furniture onto the moving van. But then the driver offered him $2.50 an hour and now Murphy can feel the sharp wrought iron chairs and slick refrigerator in his hands and would like to raise them over his head and smash them through the motel door. He stops in front of it and in his 2 AM guts he can feel that moving van whining with inexor able headlights and tires toward Kansas and he would like to throw out a fist or a ribcage to stop it. He fits the key into the bright red door of room 126, pushes and thinks he can't do it. He can't go to Kansas just to prove that he can't take Kansas, just to break down under that truck and that intricate and coronary load of furniture. The stage, the altar. Murphy steps onto the motel room carpet, drinks and looks. He knows that with a single shout he could have the lights on, he could have the floor strewn with shredded Kleenex and his wife propped up and rocking behind devastated eyes moan ing: "You can't be serious. A nineteen year old girl. Have you gone mad? You can't leave us this way. We're your family." And she would be right and his son would be sitting up rubbing the sleep and melodrama out of his eyes and Murphy can't do that to either of them. So while his family sleeps, he drinks and wanders in their midst, looking at them. He stops first in front of his wife who lies curled as if she were expecting her pillow at any moment to sput ter and catch fire. Murphy smoothes her hair and lifts the blanket to her hand. When she clutches it to her throat, he knows he had no right to touch her. Drink ing, he moves to his son who sleeps as if his father had never driven to Des Moines. March, 1966 17</page><page sequence="5">Because it is the closest he can now come to Annie, Murphy must caress and displace that lie. Putting down his bottle of tequila, he sweeps up his sleeping son, steals out the door and down the steps. He stops at poolside, holding him against both suicide and abduc tions, under the necessary and overwrought dome of the Missouri stars. Rememering the roll of Annie below him, Murphy whispers, "I love you Matthew, boy," and his son sleeps as if that assertion need never have been made. Making the most he can of his grip and judgment, Murphy walks to the edge of the pool and stares at the sign: Deep End. And because he doesn't need to be reminded, he looks into the water and is reminded of driving to Des Moines : the wobbly yellow squabbles of Fred and his wife's cancerous roomates as they hopped from the back seat to the front and twisted the rear view mirror and stared into each other's throats; the rain hitting the car like mean sheets filled with lightning and the fluted grills of semi-trucks; his wife's biopsy hanging like an ulcerous albatross around his neck. Then the sky cracking open and Des Moines going dia phonous with rainbows, tequila and Annie in full wine regalia knocking at his door and in bed her thighs opening exactly as wide as the question of his wife's cancer until they finally closed on him and annulled ev erything and one that came before them in a benign fusion of pink flesh and flaring bone, white flesh and fusing bone. Now he opens his eyes, presses his son's sweet skull against his own, and because Murphy must put the deep end of his memory in words, he whispers: "Mat thew boy, it will never be that way again." Holding cheekbone against cheekbone, he feels the slow marrow of his son's sleep growing between himself and Annie. But as he holds him there so surely above the water, there is nothing short of murder that he can do about it. Murphy turns from the pool, and because there is something mean and desperate in him that wants his wife to wake and find them gone, he hurries with his son toward darkened room 126.</page></plain_text>
