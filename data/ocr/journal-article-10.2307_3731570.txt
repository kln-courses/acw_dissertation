<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEORIZING TO SOME PURPOSE: 'DECONSTRUCTION' IN THE LIGHT OF GOETHE AND SCHILLER'S AESTHETICS - THE CASE OF DIE WAHLVERWANDTSCHAFTEN* 'If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim' (Kipling) When Marilyn Butler announced, on her accession to the Chair of English Litera- ture at Cambridge, that she was 'not sure we have an aesthetics', she was voicing a long-standing suspicion of aesthetic theory among Anglo-Saxon literary scholars, one given perhaps its most uncompromising articulation by W. K. Wimsatt.1 A similar lack of interest in the subject is evident in the Structuralists' logistic approach, in Russian Formalism, and in all rhetoric-based analyses, including the traditional French explication de texte. It is perhaps hardly surprising, then, that recent literary study should have been so quickly inundated by 'Post-structuralism' in the guise of a 'deconstructive criticism' said to be practised pre-eminently at Yale, which seems to consist in the application to the canon of world literature ofJacques Derrida's way of analysing texts. For, having no theoretical defence against a complete assimilation of literary texts to philosophical texts - based on their alleged common rhetoricity - the discipline of literary criticism has, to a consider- able extent at least, been swallowed up by philosophical discourse. Paul de Man's professed belief in the intrinsic value of theoretical speculation has encouraged a flood of writings that take no cognizance of the historical aspects of texts, let alone their aesthetic structure, but set about treating literary texts as if they were metaphysical in nature, 'the philosophical reading of literary texts', as it has been called.2 For all I know this may have produced significant philosophical results; what is clear to me is that it has done, and, I shall argue, can do, nothing to further scholarship as a practical enquiry. Taking as my point of departure a recent reading of Schiller's theory of play, I shall propose not only that Weimar aesthetics provides a theory that underpins the whole enterprise of literary scholarship, seemingly challenged by these new developments, but also that it has the great virtue of offering a bulwark against the zeal of some practitioners of so-called 'literary theory'. In an article published towards the end of 1986, Robert Wilson offers what he calls a (to my mind, timely) 'opposition between Schiller's and Derrida's concepts of * A version of the theoretical part of this article was delivered to a conference on 'The Arts and Disciplines of Literary Study' at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, in April 1987. The full version was given at the Conference of University Teachers of German held at the University of Sheffield in March 1988. I am indebted to Professor Elizabeth M. Wilkinson for the formulation of my title, which emerged in private conversation with her. It is clearly an echo of the famous book by her own teacher, L. Susan Stebbing, Thinking to Some Purpose (London, 1939), but responsibility for its use here is of course mine. 1 Marilyn Butler, in a conversation with Stephen Games entitled 'A Sense of History: New Premisses', broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on I i November 1986; W.

Rightly, he cites Schiller's Aesthetic Letters as the locus classicus 'from which most modern thinking on the subject stems' (p. 83). However, in simply characterizing Schiller's concept of play as 'always purposeful' (p. 84) and as an act of will (pp. 83-84), he is closer to Eugen Fink (whom he quotes) and J. Huizinga (who is unaccountably left out of account) than to Schiller himself. For despite quoting from Elizabeth M. Wilkinson's and L. A. Willoughby's authoritative trans- lation of the Aesthetic Letters, the author makes no use of the scholarship provided in the introduction, commentary, glossary, or appendices to that edition. In particular, he fails to register Schiller's fundamental distinction between aesthetic play on the one hand and ordinary (physical or imaginative) play on the other. The result is that the comparison he sets up between Schiller and Derrida (specifically, the latter's concept of'freeplay', as a result of'the indeterminate plurisignificance of language as such' (p. 76)) is far less informative than it ought to be. It is simply wrong to say that 'the opposition turns upon the presence or absence of purpose' (p. 83), an over-simplification that reduces the issue to that hoary old philosophical pair, 'freedom-necessity' (p. 84).4 What a more considered comparison of Schiller with Derrida reveals is, in fact, something far less abstract, and infinitely more interest- ing: not an opposition at all, but a discrimination, between concepts functioning on different levels of thought. As Wilkinson and Willoughby have made crystal clear, Schiller carefully differen- tiates that special sort of play that is distinctive of a work of art from any other: from the exuberant burning-off of excess energy that we share with the animals; from the overtly purposeful play of games; from that associationist play of vivid imagery called fantasy.5 None of these is free: each is subordinate to a purpose. But in aesthetic play the situation is fundamentally different. The defining characteristic of aesthetic experience, for Schiller, is the experience of the apparent autonomy of the object in view. This manifest freedom, 'Freiheit in der Erscheinung', consists for Schiller in the apparently self-regulating structure of the aesthetic object- an illusion that the artist creates by establishing perceptible relations between specific features of his chosen medium and coordinating them with the medium's given semantic values. A thing of beauty, whether it be a natural phenomenon or a human artefact, sets us free by engaging both our abstractive powers ('Formtrieb') and our senses ('Stofftrieb') in a playful coordination ('Spieltrieb'), in which the exigency of the two fundamental drives is cancelled out in an experience of complete balance. It is an 'illusion', but only in a special sense: its experience depends on the 'illuding' of our habitual tendency to organize our experience by bringing concepts to bear upon it. For once we subordinate the object before us in this way, the coordination in which its aesthetic character inheres vanishes, and the vivid impression of its existence is 3 Robert R. Wilson, 'Play, Transgression and Carnival: Bakhtin and Derrida on Scriptor Ludens', Mosaic, I9 (1986), 73-89 (p. 85). 4 The undue simplicity of this opposition is not mitigated, but only blurred, by the introduction of Jakobson's dubious 'distinction' between 'metaphor' and 'metonymy' (p. 84). 5 See Friedrich Schiller, On the Aesthetic Education of Man.

H. STEPHENSON but a memory, unrecoverable by rational reconstruction. But, for as long as our psyche (or, more specifically, our imagination) in its aesthetic modality, is engaged, the reality of the experience is indubitable. The power of an aesthetic object can be rekindled at any time, provided that someone discern its immanent pattern which, as in the case of a poem, may be dimmed over time by semantic breaks and sound-shifts but can never be completely obliterated, given a minimum of cultural continuity.6 Thus, as if in answer to Derrida's question 'what is experience?'7 Schiller provides an account of a mode of experience that is not of a 'divided, duplicitous character' at all (Culler, p. 63) but rather has the same quality as the sensation of summer described by Proust in a passage (vigorously deconstructed by Paul de Man) in A la recherche du temps perdu, as 'containing something of the essence [of beautiful days]':... 'It not only awakens their image in our memory, it guarantees their return, their actual, persistent, immediately accessible presence.'8 Aesthetic experience, for Schiller, feels 'originary' and 'unreconstituted' in just this way.9 In addition, the significance of aesthetic play does not lie solely in its power to engage us as whole beings. It lies, too, in its capacity to express what would otherwise remain unexpressed because discursively inexpressible (WW, pp. lxvii, 308). In aesthetic experience what is outer becomes symbolic of what is within (a primary act of meaning presupposed by all semiotic systems). The aesthetic image, retained in the psyche, with its real unity of feeling, becomes a nodal point, as it were, of all consequent thinking and discourse: the mere propositional unity of conceptual predication has, in so far as it is about reality at all, aesthetic experience at its base. This is the 'subordinate' role that Schiller envisaged for the aesthetic in human creativity, a function distinguished from its 'coordinate' role as direct object of contemplation, and distinct again from its 'superordinate' role in gracious living.10 A 'Third Realm' (or, to use a biological analogy, an ambient) is envisaged by Schiller, created by interlacing the texture of those outward, physical, and observ- able aspects of milieu and person that are in any case already subordinate to purposeful action: a perceptible aesthetic form is thereby established, one which clothes and sustains activity and onto which - as onto any aesthetic object - the free and dynamic play of the inner life can be projected and released. The purpose of my exposition of these points, all long ago established and presented with exemplary clarity by Wilkinson and Willoughby, is not only to remind those who would use Schiller's arguments in the present debate on literary studies of their complexity but also to bring home their practical temper.

To mistake the difference between Schiller's and Derrida's concepts of play as turning 'upon the presence or absence of purpose' is plainly untenable. It is essential to Schiller's concept of the apparently self-regulating and self-regulated structure of the aesthetic object that no intention should be percep- tible. What is more, it misses a far plainer and much more instructive difference between the two views of play in question. What Schiller is concerned with is the freedom felt in aesthetic experience, to whose elucidation he subordinates his powers of abstract argumentation. What Derrida is clearly preoccupied with is abstract argumentation itself, or, more accurately, the intimate interrelationship of language and discursive thought. For what is the 'play of signification' that Derrida has traced with such meticulous Akribie but an effect and condition of the inherent abstractness and arbitrariness of the system of language itself? Surely his significance lies in having demonstrated that language, in its abstraction, tends to a pure, notational logistic, in which diacritical opposition and infinite deferment of ultimate reference are ineluctable (compare Culler, pp. 85-87). If this is the case, then surely he is doing, albeit with tools sharpened by reflection on linguistics, what many another thinker in our tradition, troubled by the instability of abstractions, has done before him. The fact that abstractions 'presuppose' one another (A. N. Whitehead), that 'die Grundworte sind nicht Einzelworte, sondern Wortpaare', as Martin Buber puts it in Ich und Du (are 'co-implicates' (W. M. Urban)) means that they are unstable by virtue of the fact that the fundamental logical operation of implication is itselfa mere abstraction from our felt coherence of things, one whose stability is a function of the relation between experience and thought.11 Where this relation becomes tenuous, most markedly at the higher reaches of abstraction, logical rules seem arbitrary and perhaps they are. One need think only of Kant's reflections on the 'antinomies of Reason' in the Transcendental Dialectic of his First Critique, xwhich he sees as a result of the restlessness of reason, or of Whitehead's misgivings about the adequacy of the idioms of ordinary language to frame abstract propositions, or of P. F. Strawson's more recent conclusion that natural language is inadequate to ultimate abstraction,12 to see that whether or not Derrida is continuing Heidegger's 'destruc- tion' of metaphysics, his enterprise is most certainly metaphysical in nature. In this historical perspective, it is clear that, like other metaphysicians, he is 'perplexed by the inconsistent presuppositions underlying... inherited modes of expression' (Whitehead, p. vi), or, at the very least, that what he is doing has very little in common with aesthetics, as Schiller understood and practised it, and much more in common with these perennial philosophical reflections.13 After all, Derrida's interest in literature is no more 'literary criticism' in the usual sense of that term as a practical activity than is Whitehead's citing of Milton or Wordsworth: his interest, 1 Whitehead, Process and Reality (London, I929), p. 3 (compare Derrida's very similar formulation - 'the essential mutual implication' (Mimoires, p. 71)); Buber, Die Schriften iber das Dialogische Prinzip (Heidelberg, 1954), p. 7; Urban, Language and Reality (New Haven, Connecticut, 1939), p. 123. 12 Kant Kritik der reinen Vernunft, B. 785 (see also B. 805 and B. 877, where reason in its transcendental use is said to be inherently dialectical); Whitehead, Process and Reality, especially pp. 18, 460; Strawson, Individuals: An Essay in Descriptive Metaphysics (Oxford, 1959), especially pp. 58, 68. 13 Compare Culler, p. Io9: 'Deconstruction ... investigates the work of metaphysical oppositions.'

STEPHENSON 385 like Whitehead's, is in texts that reveal, from a philosophic stance, ultimate propositions - in Derrida's case, an opportunity for dissemination, the outward- flowing production of meaning without direction, in the hope of at least glimpsing something of that Other, that 'suppressed reading', hitherto subjugated by the authority of accepted discursive practice, buttressed by our traditional privileging of speech over writing as a corroboration of the illusion that abstractions refer to reality.14 My point here is not to question the validity of Derrida's enterprise; that must be left to those competent to judge: the philosophers. It is rather that, as the compari- son with Schiller makes manifest, Derrida's thinking has no more direct bearing on aesthetic questions than does any other philosopher's high-flown speculations. The hierarchical structure of thought, from particular to general, entails a methodologi- cal rule, called by Russell 'logical typing': namely, that a higher order of explanation is resorted to legitimately only when clarity necessitates it. It is simply a logical fallacy to suppose that what holds true (if it does!) of language at its most abstract also holds, and to the same extent, on 'lower' levels, where language develops in a common social life and is shot through and through with that welter of more or less coherent theories called common sense. It is a non-sequitur, a sleight of mind, to slip from language in one of its special uses to 'all language' (Wilson, p. 76). Certainly it is most inept when metaphysical analysis of this kind is substituted for literary criticism and applied to language in its aesthetic mode: that is to say, to poetry, for here the abstractions of language have been assimilated to the physical qualities of the medium to yield an aesthetic structure pregnant with import, one which a purely philosophical approach can only undo and destroy. Of course, all this is not to deny that metaphysics has any relevance to thinking about aesthetic experience, and Schiller, who took his reader on a bracing abstract and transcendental route through letters i and 2 of his Aesthetic Education, would be the last to do so. He concurred wholeheartedly in the spirit of Goethe's well-known dictum, 'Mitjedem aufmerksamen Blick in die Welt theoretisieren wir schon'.15 He was well aware that such implicit theorizing was inevitable, and that clarity of explanation often demanded its being made explicit and consciously elaborated. But both of them were equally insistent on the need to attend closely to the phenomena if theory was not to become empty 'conceit', an epistemological poise given succinct expression in another of Goethe's sayings: 'Das H6chste ware zu begreifen, daB alles Faktische schon Theorie ist. Die Blaue des Himmels offenbart uns das Grundgesetz der Chromatik. Man suche nur nichts hinter den Phanomenen: sie selbst sind die Lehre.'16 While they insist, then, that intellectual difficulties must be confronted and an unrelenting attempt made to sort them out, they are at one with Kant in giving priority to the practical over the speculative, because ultimately all rational interest is practical.17 The undeniable reality of the conative drive, like Freud's primarily object-seeking libido, means that a viable relationship with a world of real objects must be negotiated, and that reason is set the practical imperative of enlightening and guiding our purposeful attack on the 14 See Of Grammatology, translated by Gayatri Spivak (Baltimore, Maryland, and London, 1976), p. 20. 15 Jubilaums Ausgabe, edited by E. v.

That in turn means that conceptual coherence is at a premium if order is to be discovered in tackling the world. The role of metaphysics, in their view, is to enlighten, to bring more clarity and intelligibility into what is given to us as a more or less obscure welter of experience. If any sphere of thought, let alone the ultimate context of metaphysics, is in turmoil, however fruitful, the practically- engaged mind will demur from borrowing from it wholesale unless and until a settled, well-defined schema is on offer. Clear coherent principles are necessary presuppositions for practical work, and the investigator of phenomena will forego theoretical subtlety if the price is conceptual incoherence and stultification, with its concomitant lack of a solid grasp of real things. In other words 'revisionary metaphysics' (Strawson's term), for all its philosophical value, is of no practical use.18 It is this practical bent that makes Goethe's and Schiller's aesthetics of such value to literary scholars. For scholarship of any kind is possible only if we believe that there are discernible objects existing in time and space about which relevant knowledge can be gained, or 'constructed'. It is not merely a matter of proceeding, as George Steiner would have us do, 'as if' literary works had phenomenological status.19 The aesthetic theory of classical Weimar underwrites this status of literary works as 'Dinge unter Dingen' (in Buber's phrase) in two distinct, though related, ways. First, those works we call 'poetic' make a direct sensuous and physical appeal and are as real, as palpable, as any other object of our senses. Secondly, since aesthetic activity is held to lie, in its subordinate function, at the very centre of all man's creativity, every man-made form, however elaborated and etiolated, is rooted in what Goethe called the individual's Lebensform - 'the form of life' that is an organic-aesthetic precipitate of the encounter of self and world.20 On this theory, we do not have to proceed 'on the model of supplementation figured by signifying processes' (Culler, p. I05). We can, if we will, operate with a quite different and equally heuristic and ironic model, one whose validity is grounded in experience, and in this way the aesthetic theory of Goethe and Schiller offers a sound point of departure and basis for rigorous work. For the aesthetic object exists, and is thus amenable both to theoretical and to historical modes of inquiry, each of which will mutually condition the other. Because the literary work only seems free to aesthetic contemplation but is, in fact, the product of the meeting of a human mind with the medium of the language, it is open to a mode of teleological enquiry characteristic of all humanistic research, one which ascribes, for heuristic purposes, meanings to a statement which, on the historical evidence, the author can fairly be supposed to have intended by the words he used. While, theoretically, this context consists of all those elements that stand, have stood, and will stand in direct or indirect relationship with the text under consideration, practically, it is made up of such elements as the community of readers is in fact aware of. Text and 18 This ironic, undogmatic view of the need to explore the world with such tools as we have while always hoping for better from those specializing in various related areas is, it seems to me, very close indeed to Edward Said's characterization of any point of departure as 'a necessary fiction' (see his Beginnings: Intention and Method (New York, 1975), p. 50), and very close, too, to Harold Bloom's insistence on the primacy of the will (see Culler, p. 29). 19 George Steiner, 'A New Meaning of Meaning', TLS, 8 November 1985, pp. 1262, 1275-76 (p. 1275). 20 See his conversation with D.

STEPHENSON 387 context thus function as 'interdependent variables'21 in an open-ended but not 'directionless' process of understanding. Moreover, since their orientation is funda- mentally practical, in the sense of being firmly focused on the object as it confronts the perceiving subject, the resources of common sense and of ordinary language, clarified and enhanced by reflection where desirable and possible, are quite adequate, and little time need be spent on mastering neologisms or an unfamiliar terminology, let alone on attempting to 'go beyond' language. I hope it is clear that my intention here is not to add my voice to what Derrida has called 'the campaign' against Deconstruction (Memoires, p. 41, n. 5) but rather to attempt to circumscribe and maintain in the preseit context of academic debate, with the help of Weimar aesthetics, the legitimate purposes of literary scholarship. For the value of juxtaposing Derrida with Schiller (and Goethe) does not lie in a rehearsal of the philosophical commonplaces that it has been presented as. Far more important is that it throws into stark relief two quite distinct if ultimately related areas of valid intellectual activity: philosophical speculation and practical enquiry. Put another way, it challenges us to make a judgement of value and to choose: between giving priority to ideas, deferring our conative drive for objective know- ledge (and that, of course, includes scholarship) for the sake of metaphysical adventure on the one hand, and, on the other, giving priority to experience, by continuing to work to understand the texts which our culture presents us with, while waiting patiently for the philosophers to produce a clear and distinct conceptual framework that might more precisely underpin our intuitions of coherence.22 We cannot have it both ways: philosophy and scholarship pull in different directions, the former towards abstraction, the latter towards the particular and concrete. Indeed, taking my cue from Derrida himself, I realize I should not, strictly speaking, talk of 'choice' at all.23 As he and others (for example, Culler, p. 17) have insisted, the work involved in precisely coming to terms with Deconstruction - the reading (Mimoires, pp. 41-42, n. 5) and the 'analystic patience' (p. I 17) - is so great that no one could reasonably be expected to keep up with developments in that area of thought, let alone to contribute to them, as well as to cultivate any significant field of scholarship: not a choice, then, more a necessity, imposed by what Kant calls the dialectical nature of the human mind. Convinced of the value, the interest, of a work, the scholar aims to establish its historical significance in its context, and thus offers to more speculative minds a reading over and against which they can set about their work. A revealing example of how deconstructive criticism seeks to cope with specific texts is an article on Goethe's Wahlverwandtschaften, soon to be reprinted, by the distinguished American contributor to English studies, J. Hillis Miller, entitled 'A "Buchstabliches" Reading of The Elective Affinities'.24 Miller's thesis is thoroughly metaphysical. He holds that Goethe's novel demonstrates the unbridgeable gap between two traditional views of what an entity is and how entities relate to each 21 A term used by the psychoanalyst, Ernst Kris, in 'On Preconscious Mental Processes', Psychoanalytic Quarterly, I9 (1950), 540-60, cited by Wilkinson in 'Reflections', p.8I. (For Derrida's unequivocal insistence on the necessity, and open-endedness, of'context', see Culler, pp. 123-27). 22 There are signs that a consensus is perhaps emerging among philosophers as to the broad outline of such a categorial scheme; see, for instance, Stephan K6rner, Metaphysics: Its Structure and Function (Cambridge and London, I984) and the new series announced by Cambridge University Press entitled Ideas in Context, edited by Richard Rorty and others. 23 See L'Ecriture et la diffdrence, pp. 427-28. 24 Glyph, 6 (1979), 1-23; to be reprinted in Miller's forthcoming book, Adriadne's Thread.

On the one hand, 'every entity which is in fact really a single entity has as a main feature of its identity a strong tendency to hang together, as a drop of quicksilver will recombine if it is broken into fragments' (p. 3). On the other hand, entities are seen as having no identity and 'such selves seek to ground themselves in others, by drawing others to themselves, but each self succeeds only in experiencing its solitude' (p. I 2). These two ideas - let us, for clarity's sake, say with Kant, these two Maxims of Reason, the one of Unity, the other of Affinity - are basic to 'the system ... which makes up the fabric of Western metaphysics' (pp. 22-23) and, as such, basic to 'the self-subverting heterogeneity of each great work of Western literature' (p. I I), since Language itself embodies this antinomy.25 In short, Die Wahlverwandtschaften reflects the 'Gegensinn der Urworte' (whose identification in the novel is hardly new)26 'latent in the system itself' (p. 23). On the face of it, this is a thesis as irrefutable (and uninteresting) as urging that the novel demonstrates 'the laws, powers, and limitations' of the German language (p. 7). But, in fact, more is being claimed than this. Although the term 'intention' is not used, the directionless elaboration of this metaphysical opposition is attributed to Goethe as author. Miller's text is awash with locutions that imply that Goethe, wittingly or un- wittingly, had this unending antinomy in mind as the import of his novel, as 'the fundamental issue in Die Wahlverwandtschaften, both in Goethe's own language and in the story he tells' (p. 7). Miller buttresses his interpretation not only with such oblique, personifying, expressions as 'the novel everywhere indicates' (p. I9) and 'the novel shows' (p. 22) but also with bold (one might say, crass) identifications of author and text, such as 'Goethe (or "the narrator")' (p. I), 'Goethe's notion of substance or selfhood' (p. 3), 'for Goethe' (pp. 4, I2). This tendency is perhaps at its clearest in Miller's unqualified attribution to Goethe of his character Eduard's remark that 'Man is a true Narcissus'. It is as if we were to take either the insensitive philistine Mittler's views on marriage, or indeed those of the worldly-wise Count, as Goethe's, without further ado. Nowhere in the whole of Wahlverwandtschaften criticism can Barry Nisbet's sum- mons to logical rigour have been more needful than it is here.27 If we are not to be overawed - or, perhaps better said, browbeaten - by the delphic sententiousness of Miller's rhetoric, we need to hold fast to the fact that not one single specific reason is ever adduced for making this attribution of metaphysical problematics and perplexity to Goethe, only the conflation of philosophy and other forms of discourse that is essential to the enterprise ofdeconstructive criticism in general. For it is not just sleight of language, but a sleight of mind that creates the impression that Miller's remarks have to do with the work as a product of Goethe's creativity. His 'reasoning' boils down to the syllogism: 'Die Wahlverwandtschaften is a novel. I Novels embody certain metaphysical oppositions. | Therefore, Die Wahlverwandtschaften embodies these metaphysical oppositions.' Now either this is merely 'analytic' as the philo- sophers say (like 'A is A') or, like the schoolboy conundrum about Socrates, it slyly 25 In the form of an infinitely regressive figurative structure that attempts to 'manifest the literal literally' (p. 7): 'Die Wahlverwandtschaften could be described as an extended allegorical investigation ofprospopoeia in the form of a "realistic story" of marriage and adulterous passion.' 26 Compare Jeremy Adler's recent elaboration of these 'zwei entgegengesetzte Daseinsformen' in 'Eine fast magische Anziehungskraft': Goethes 'Wahlverwandstschaften' und die Chemie seiner Zeit (Munich, 1987), especially pp. 205, 209, 215. 27H.

STEPHENSON 389 imposes what interest it may have by shifting the meaning of terms. The 'syllogism' about Socrates runs: 'Socrates is a man. | Men are spread all over the world. Therefore, Socrates is spread all over the world.' Only such a shift in the meaning of the term 'novel' lends any (albeit specious) content to the argumentation: that is to say, a shift from 'novel' in the ordinary sense of 'the kind of rhetorical structure whose characteristics we are all familiar enough with' in line I to 'novel' as 'a piece of discourse characterized by metaphysical opposition' in the second line. The fact is that despite all the high-sounding abstract talk of such nebulosities as the 'onto- logically grounded system' (p. 9) and 'this self-emptying relation of the self to itself' (p. I2), and for all the resonating plenitude of what Lovejoy called 'metaphysical pathos' ('life incarnates language', we are told on page I ), there is a curious absence of anything approaching literary theory, in the sense of a general account of the differential properties of a work of fiction couched in language. Indeed, no object existing in time and space is kept in theoretical view. There is, simply, no proposition on offer about an object, and hence no point of focus. Given this poverty of genuine theory it is no wonder that Miller proceeds in a bewildering, not to say chaotic, fashion, linking abstract idea to abstract idea in an orgy of arbitrary associations. Moreover, lack of any theory of what it is he has before him blinds him to crucial textual facts which might, if registered, have checked a headlong rush into whimsy. He misses, for example, the point ofOttilie's statement, 'ich bin aus meiner Bahn geschritten und ich soll nicht wieder hinein', by translating it (on pages 2 and 22) as 'I have stepped out of my course and I cannot recover it again'. Soil should be translated as 'am not to', 'not supposed to', thus leaving open the question of whether she will or will not try to get back on course, a pointer to Ottilie's courageous determination that is mistaken here for a sign of despairing resignation. He is deaf to the pervasive irony of the novel to which Barry Nisbet and Hans Reiss have emphatically directed attention:28 he solemnly accepts what he calls 'this little lesson in nineteenth-century chemistry' (that is the conversation in Chapter 4 of Part I) as establishing 'the universal natural law the novel exemplifies' (p. 8).29 Thus untrammelled by either textual or contextual constraints he is free to indulge in a bizarre commentary, best illustrated perhaps by his remarks on Eduard's point concerning Man's anthropomorphic penchant for seeing himself as a foil behind the glass of a mirror reflecting the world: The German word here is Folie, 'foil', with an overtone playing from one language to another, of folly, and of foil, in the sense of fencing foil, in the sense of frustrate or impede, as in 'foiled again', and in the sense of fold or leaf, as in 'folio', the fold of a book, or as in the gold leaf used as in the background of a medieval painting. (p. 15) Whatever else this does, it hardly focuses attention on the object in the way a theory ought to do. This kind of argumentation is, it seems to me, typical in two respects of that otherwise heterogeneous collection of ideas about discourse that has sprung up in 28 Blackwell German Texts edition (Oxford, I971), pp. xvi, xlvii. 29 This despite the Narrator's irony in respect of the Hauptmann's lack of contact with the subject for over ten years; compare Miller's acceptance of Ottilie's 'saintliness' and 'miraculous healing power' (p. Io), again despite the Narrator's ironic (and emphatic) use of the word scheinen in Chapter 18, Part In. Miller evinces no sensitivity to the ambiguity of the characters (stressed by Nisbet and Reiss, pp. xxx-xxxvii); on page 8 he attributes to Goethe what Eduard has to say about the symbolic relation between the chemical formula and life (and he misinterprets Eduard as saying that the formula exemplifies the structure of metaphor).</page><page sequence="10">'Deconstruction', Goethe, and Schiller the last twenty years or so and has become known as the 'New Critical Practice' or, quite simply and quite erroneously, as 'Literary Theory': first, a tendency to identify those general propositions - of all kinds: psychological, philosophical, economic- traditional in our culture, that Aristotle called Commonplaces and Goethe Urworte, as if they were the burden of what the author is saying,30 secondly, the new 'turn' given these, in truth, age-old ideas by clothing them in a with-it terminology. Thus Ehrhard Bahr draws on the (very dubious) distinction made by Roman Jakobson between 'metaphor' and 'metonomy' to articulate the rather obvious difference between the sequential pattern of the Lehrjahre and the configurational pattern ofthe Wanderjahre.31 Similarly, in an article on 'the play of textuality' in Schiller's ballads Elizabeth Wright discusses the paradox of authority-and-autonomy in terms of 'the text's disagreement with itself',32 and in a recent 'Lacanian reading' of Goethe's Iphigenie, the tension between subjective and objective truth is transposed into terms of parole and langue.33 This clearly marks a return to good old (I should say, with Richard Levin, bad old) Thematics.34 But it is a return with a very significant difference, for whereas thematic criticism substituted a part (Stoff) for the whole (Gestalt), deconstruction, aping that dissemination that Derrida and others consider fruitful in metaphysical speculation (and holding, as Elizabeth Wright has it, that infinite regress is 'inescapable' (p. 294)), introduces an unrelated and contextless diffuse- ness into the discussion of a chosen text, one which leads away from the text into the kind of irrelevant reverie that Miller offers when he states that the word 'Kunst- wort', in Die Wahlverwandtschaften, 'suggests . . . "artistic word", or "aesthetic word", a word casting a beautiful veil of appearance over the substance it names, the veil of Maya, so to speak' (pp. 5-6). By contrast with all this, knowledge of Goethe and Schiller's aesthetic theory has led scholars directly to the text of Die Wahlverwandtschaften. It enables one to see, for example, far more in Ottilie than Miller's description of her as an 'incarnation of the figure of catachresis' (p. I9). Her hard-won and painfully slow growth from the undifferentiated naivety of the private felt life of a child to the sophisticated though no less felt life of an adult is indeed an education 'through, and to, the aesthetic'. Similarly, those who have drawn, directly or indirectly, on L. A. Willoughby's work on Goethe's 'wiederholte Spiegelungen' have begun to discern the cyclical rhetorical structure of the novel. But it is not just the structure of the Stoffthat comes into clearer focus when the novel is set in this context: the form, the very texture, is also illuminated. In spite of the emphasis on the Letter in his title, Miller has nothing to say about the 'beauty and power' of the language which he extols (pp. i, 6). Indeed, he dismisses as 'impersonal' (p. i8) those Diary entries of Ottilie's in which, I have argued elsewhere, the language is aesthetically organized and, thus, within the fiction the personal precipitate of Ottilie herself (Goethe's Wisdom Literature, pp. 260- 62). Just as in his philosophical poetry, where Goethe takes conflicting 'Maxims of 30 See Miller's introduction of Aristotle on metaphor (p. 7). 31 'Revolutionary Realism in Goethe's Wanderjahre', in Goethe's Narrative Fiction, edited by WilliamJ. Lillyman (Berlin and New York, 1983), pp. 16-75 (especially pp. 162, I7 I, where Bahr concedes that the distinction is fuzzy). 32 'The Rhetorical Discourse of Schiller's Ballads: An Essay in New Critical Practice', GLL, 37 (1984), 280-96 (p. 294). 33 Imgard W.

H. STEPHENSON 39I Reason', assimilates them to the body of language, and transmutes them to yield an infinitely more original meaning,35 so in these aphorisms age-old truths are taken and enhanced. This density of organization is also to be found in the body of the novel itself, for instance, in the climactic passage (in Chapter I7, Part ii) in which the Narrator attempts to evoke the almost preternatural intimacy enjoyed by Ottilie and Eduard: Und so blieb er, wie er wollte, wie er muBte. Aber auch dem Behagen glich nichts, wenn er sich mit ihr zusammenfand. Und so war auch ihr dieselbe Empfindung geblieben; auch sie konnte sich dieser seligen Notwendigkeit nicht entziehen. Nach wie vor iibten sie eine ubeschreibliche, fast magische Anziehungskraft gegen einander aus. Sie wohnten unter einem Dache; aber selbst ohne gerade aneinander zu denken, mit andern Dingen beschaftigt, von der Gesellschaft hin- und hergezogen, niherten sie sich einander. Fanden sie sich in einem Saale, so dauerte es nicht lange und sie standen, sie saBen nebeneinander. Nur die nichste Nahe konnte sie beruhigen, aber auch v6llig beruhigen, und diese Nahe war genug; nicht eines Blickes, nicht eines Wortes, keiner Gebarde, keiner Beriihrung bedurfte es, nur des reinen Zusammenseins. Dann waren es nicht zwei Menschen, es war nur ein Mensch im bewuBtlosen vollkommnen Behagen, mit sich selbst zufrieden und mit der Welt. Ja, hatte man eins von beiden am letzten Ende der Wohnung festgehalten, das andere hatte sich nach und nach von selbst, ohne Vorsatz zu ihm hinbewegt. Das Leben war ihnen ein Ratsel, dessen Auflosung sie nur miteinander fanden. Here, by the simplest of devices - repetition with variation - the growing, almost unbearable, intensity of the lovers' attraction for one another is given plastic form in the body of language. In a recursive structure the element einander is used five times and on three of these occasions a different prefix marks an increasing intimacy: it moves from an-, through neben-, to miteinander. This felt process is also enacted in the powerful polyptoton series, naherten, nachste Nahe, Nahe. In this way, the antinomy between unity and other-relatedness is overcome in the very body of language: 'one'-ness (ein) is emphatically conjoined with 'other'-ness (ander) and sustained throughout a process of increasing intensity of relatedness. What in thought may be irreconcilable is achieved in aesthetic experience. The point here is that all this is undone by a deconstructive reading. Thematic approaches and Structuralism (indeed most '-isms') notoriously overlook aesthetic structure. Deconstruction is far worse: it has the effect of dissolving the texture of the work. The essence of the aesthetic use of language lies, after all, in the coordination effected between given meaning and sound and look. The play of meanings that deconstructive criticism entertains will simply not mesh with the sound-look relations established to yield import, and we are left with a mere welter of literally meaningless configurations. In his tribute to the late Paul de Man, Derrida has distanced himself from his American disciples, in making very clear that 'there cannot be a deconstructive criticism' (Memoires, p. 84); that deconstruction centres so often on literary texts only because they often reveal (as do legal and political texts even more eminently) 'the very structure of the text in general' (Memoires, p. I43; my italics). Criticism, in the sense of elucidation of that human value inherent in a particular text that animates scholarship to bring it to our attention as a warm precipitation of life, is, then, not at all the business of Deconstruction. In an arresting image, Derrida locates the interest of Deconstruction in the 'cornerstone' (as opposed to the 'keystone') of a text's architectonic structure (Memoires, pp. 73-74, 76). Literary texts are of interest 35 As, for example, in the first line of'Vermachtnis' and the penultimate line of'Eins und Alles'.</page><page sequence="12">'Deconstruction', Goethe, and Schiller to Deconstruction only in as much as they reflect the alleged inherent instability of our metaphysical framework, and the shakiness of the cornerstone can be demonstrated only if the relative stability of the keystone is already evident. I take this to imply that the necessary reconstruction of the apparent intention of a work - the scholar's task - is, indeed, the attempt to reveal this 'keystone', an endeavour that may be sustained by the aesthetic theory worked out by Goethe and Schiller. Adherence to Goethe's and Schiller's aesthetics, it is true, sets the literary scholar an exacting task: through reflection, he must seek to raise what is an everyday mode of understanding to the level of mastery, if he is to be adequate to the complexity of great works. Since it is essentially a practical activity, an 'art' which requires flair, not a mechanical application of theory, it is inevitably governed by valuation and evaluation of the objects on which so much energy and time is to be expended, and, since it is aesthetic objects that are his central concern, the scholar must constantly discipline his imagination in that aesthetic modality that is the appropriate response to a work of art. Yet it is this repeated exposure to the most complex of human experiences that gives him the confidence to act on his assumption that any text has phenomenological status and to feel justified in extending the same method that can yield such a wealth of meaning to other, non-aesthetic, more simply organized, discursive, rhetorical, texts, on the Schillerian principle that all human creativity has its roots in the aesthetic, and may thus be fruitfully approached as a phenomenon. That, it seems to me, is at least part of what Nietzsche meant when, despite (or, rather, because of) his Romantic tendency to rhetorical analysis, his 'critique of metaphysics' (as Derrida calls it (Memoires, p. I34) ), he insists, in unison with the founders of German Classicism, on the power of aesthetic experience to reveal meaning and value: 'Die Welt ist nur als asthetisches Phanomen gerechtfertigt.' It is the lack of interest in 'justification', indeed of responsibility, that is so disturbing about Deconstructive Criticism - and not only in respect of literary texts, as the recent furore over Paul de Man's collaborationist past has underlined. 392 UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW R.
