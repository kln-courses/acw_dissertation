<plain_text><page sequence="1">86 THE GLOBAL BORDER: TRANSNATIONALISM AND CULTURAL HYBRIDISM IN ALEJANDRO MORALES'S THE RAG DOLL PLAGUES Manuel M. Martin-Rodriguez It is certainly not by using a minor language as a dialect, by regionalizing or ghettoizing, that one becomes revolutionary; rather, by using a number of mi nority elements, by connecting, conjugating them, one invents a specific, unfore seen, autonomous becoming. Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus The problem is not the distinction between major and minor language; it is one of a becoming. It is a question not of reterritorializing oneself on a dialect or a patois but of deterritorializing the major language. Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus By starting with two quotes from Deleuze and Guattari, I am trying to situate the topic of this essay in a broader context, which deals with questions of language usage, minority discourses, cultural hybridism, and the relation between vernacular and hegemonic cultures in the Americas. In Deleuze and Guattari's understanding of the linguistic aspects of this issue, the notions of be coming and deterritorialization are most relevant. As they have explained, "becoming" is to be understood as a process, a potentiality that always pertains to the minoritarian. In the case of languages, as the two epigraphs I chose suggest, minor ones are "potential agents of the major language's entering into a becoming-minoritarian of all of its dimensions and elements" (Deleuze and Guatarri, A Thousand Plateaus, 106). In other words, minor languages erode, as it were, a major language from within, deterritorializing it, breaking up its system's supposed homogeneity. In their discussions, Deleuze and Guattari often exemplify their arguments by referring to the case of English as subverted by African Americans' speech (A Thousand Plateaus) and by analyzing Kafka's use of German for his writings (Kafka). What would happen if we extended Deleuze and Guattari's analysis to the relation between English and Spanish in Chicano/a literature? Is their argumentation useful for a consideration of Chicano/a languages and literature? These are questions that have lingered in my mind for a while, growing into the starting point for this essay. They are questions that, no doubt, will re quire at best a controversial and as yet provisional answer. The second of the epigraphs, in particular, seemed to me to be particularly open to generat ing a polemical response when extended to the field of Chicano/a languages and literature. After all, Deleuze and Guattari's seeming rejection of the dialect and the patois looks like a major blow to the idea of linguistic difference that was so dear to Chicano/a writers during the height of the Chicano movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and that is indeed still quite alive and well among many Chicanos/as. A large number of works from the 1960s and 1970s were written in Chicano/a Spanish, and many more have been written in that language in more recent years. By so using Spanish, Chicano/a writers have often been able to stress their difference from main</page><page sequence="2">THE GLOBAL BORDER 87 stream U.S. society, to instill ethnic pride in their readers, as well as to reclaim in public a lan guage that is frequently thought of as private, in-home. I have been among many to celebrate that effort and to support Chicano/a literature written in Spanish.1 And yet, enthusiastic as I am about that part of Chicano/a literature, I cannot fail to see the applicability and appropriateness of Deleuze and Guattari's ideas to other Chicano/a texts and, in particular, to writers such as Alejandro Morales, whose writing career started in Spanish, passed through a bilingual inter lude, and has at present switched to English; or has it? When Morales published his first novel in 1975, Caras viejas y vino nuevo, his attitude to ward the politics of language was clearly stated right after the dedication of the book. This dedi cation read: "Para mi barrio, que estara conmigo siempre." An adjacent authorial note had this to say about language and literature: "Como autor chicano, espero que pronto llegue el dia en que no me vea obligado a salir de mi propio pais para publicar una novela escrita en espanol. Mexico, 1975." Both the dedication and the subsequent authorial note connect us with Deleuze and Guattari's issue of "ghettoizing" via the use of a minor language and the insistence on a barrio-marked identity. While I do not believe as they do that such use or such affiliation necessarily ghettoize a work, an author, or a literary tradition, and while I am not suggesting that Spanish should necessarily be seen as a minor language, Deleuze and Guattari's notion of language deterritorialization seems quite acceptable and productive to me in order to analyze Morales's complete oeuvre to date. In that sense, it can even be claimed that Morales's use of Spanish in his first novel was al ready a "becoming minoritarian" of standard academic Spanish, as revealed in the uneasiness with which some early reviewers commented upon it.2 Full of agrammaticalities, loan words from English, distorted syntactic structures, and the like, Caras (one could say with Deleuze and Guattari) "invents a specific, unforeseen, autonomous becoming" (A Thousand Plateaus 106). The same, of course, could be said about countless other novels, poems, and short stories writ ten by Chicanos/as in the past three decades. When dealing with bilingual literary communities, thus, the issue would no longer be that of one "minor" language and its relation to a "major" one but, rather, that of resisting and transforming two major languages while, at the same time, creating something new out of them. Indeed, Chicano/a authors who write in Spanish often re call being reproached for not using that language properly, but their literary response to that criticism seldom seeks to appropriate the formal levels of Spanish. Instead, they respond mostly by reclaiming and dignifying the popular, colloquial language that they and their families used, the very same language they assume in their ideal audiences. Although far less radical in its challenging of Spanish syntax or grammar, Morales's second novel, La verdad sin voz (1979), was still firmly grounded in the vernacular Spanish used by Chicanos/as. One example should suffice: Pero que jodidos, como que no, tambien el Senor Presidente se limpia el culo, como crees que andara con las piernas abiertas, como una mula recien pisada; no, senor, el Presidente se tiene que limpiar porque esta retacado de mierda el cabron. (121) Interesting as a discussion of Morales's use of Spanish would be, what I would like to ex amine here concerns his eventual shift from Spanish to English and the consequences that shift would entail when viewed in the light of Deleuze and Guattari's ideas on "becoming," deterrito rialization, and minoritarian discourses. I will first speculate that the shift responds to multiple reasons (rather than just one), ranging from marketing strategies to a probable change in Morales's literary agenda. I will then proceed to discuss very briefly Morales's next two novels, Reto en el paraiso (1983) and The Brick People (1988), and finally I will devote the rest of this</page><page sequence="3">88 MANUEL M. MARTIN-RODRIGUEZ essay to his latest published work to date, The Rag Doll Plagues (1993). In doing so, I will relate Plagues to what I have called elsewhere a re(b)ordering of the Americas,3 as well as to the ideas of the global border (an elaboration on McLuhan's notions of the global village), transna tionalism, and cultural hybridism. As mentioned, one of the reasons for the linguistic shift in Morales's works could very well be related to marketing strategies. Remember that Morales's first two novels were published in Mexico. According to the author, he had first submitted the manuscript of Caras to the then leading Chicano/a presses, which rejected it, most likely because of the somewhat negative im age of barrio life that the novel depicted.4 While in Mexico, Morales took the manuscript to a major national press, Joaquin Mortiz, and their reaction was far more enthusiastic, as we know. They not only published Caras but also La verdad four years later. In any case, by the time Reto en el paraiso was published by Bilingual Press in 1983, Morales was already an established figure in Chicano/a letters, without a single book published in the United States! The alternation between English and Spanish in the different chapters of Reto is thus particularly interesting because it serves both the narrative plan of the novel (a historical account of Mexican and Anglo lives in California) and the eventual switch from Spanish to English in subsequent novels by Morales. Although the bilingual format of Reto did not make the book particularly easy to sell or market in the 1980s, it could be argued that it served to prepare Morales's readership for his subsequent abandonment of Spanish.5 Consequently, when The Brick People came out in 1988 from Arte Publico Press, reviewers did not seem to be particularly surprised by the fact that the book was in English. Brick People, like Reto, is a historical novel, though a less ambitious one this time: instead of telling the broader history of California, the writer now focuses on the construction of a brick factory around Montebello, California, which creates a "model village" for its workers, as well as on the fictionalized history of the writer's own immediate family.6 To be sure, the novel also touches upon other points, among them literary theory and metaliterature, because it is obvious that Morales delights in creating an intertextual dialogue in his novels with literary theoreticians as well as with other novelists. Particularly notable is his interest in Brian McHale's understanding of postmodernism, as well as his playful recalling of characters and moments from Latin American novels.7 In terms of recurring elements, the Simons brickyard had also appeared in previous novels (as had several characters), and so there seemed to be a deliberate effort on Morales's part to relate all four novels, somehow compensating for their linguistic differences. It is as if by maintaining certain threads in common, the novels will retain a relationship that Morales's linguistic switch apparently denies them. When Plagues was issued in 1993, Morales confirmed his desire to continue writing in English. Some would see this as ironic, pointing out that when given the chance to publish in the United States Morales had forsaken his own solemn declaration about publishing in Spanish. Others could see defeatism, the acknowledgment that it is impossible to keep on writing in Spanish for a U.S. audience (although recent changes in the publishing market would most likely prove them wrong). More radical critics would claim disloyalty. Without negating some truth in the above arguments, I would like to explore the possibility of the language switch being related to a different perception of Chicano/a literature and society on the part of Morales, a per ception that better reflects the realities of the postnationalistic 1990s. First of all, we should notice that Morales's novels in Spanish were published in the 1970s, a decade marked in large part by the rhetoric and ideologic discourses of the Chicano movement. As I have suggested elsewhere, Chicano/a nationalism (centered on the idea of Aztlan as the Chicano/a homeland) struggled to reterritorialize a deterritorialized people, but in doing so, it fixed that people in a static picture that suppressed or silenced most internal differences.8</page><page sequence="4">THE GLOBAL BORDER 89 Likewise, Morales's first two novels rest upon a picture of Chicanos/as as a community, no matter that it is a community under siege, as suggested by Lomelf (185), or even on the brink of disintegration, as proposed by Gonzales-Berry (289). Whatever their condition, they are a community of Chicanos/as, and vernacular Spanish is one of the markers that help them assert their collective identity. This sense of collectivity is shattered in Reto when individuals start questioning their own group identity and when they reinvent themselves by means of a transgression that separates them from their families and groups.9 Those transgressions that in Reto are still perceived (and condemned) by most characters as sinful become in Plagues the predominant modus vivendi. Identity, already decentered for some characters in Reto, has been destabilized to the extreme in Plagues, and as a consequence the characters are presented as perpetual "transgressors" or, rather, as border crossers.10 But, as mentioned, their "crossing" is no longer seen in Plagues as an infraction, but as a necessary strategy for survival. Of equal importance, the idea of a national culture/allegiance is largely left behind in this novel, as Plagues concentrates on precisely that moment in which individual characters find themselves crossing over to a nationless zone. As a transnationalistic text, then, Plagues is a novel about the re(b)ordering of the Americas. Borders, in this sense, are not to be understood solely in their geographical sense (as they were during the Chicano movement) but in the newer sense that the term has been given by authors and critics such as Gloria Anzaldua, Renato Rosaldo, and Mary Louise Pratt. Anzaldua, for in stance, has claimed that the borderland is the natural habitat for the atravesados, the transgres sors, and she has glorified the notions of instability and mutability in relation to identity. This is what she says about the new mestiza: These numerous possibilities leave la mestiza floundering in uncharted seas. . . . The borders and walls that are supposed to keep the undesirable ideas out are entrenched habits and patterns of behavior; these habits and patterns are the enemy within. . . . The new mestiza copes by developing a tolerance for contradictions, a tolerance for ambiguity. . . . She learns to juggle cultures. She has a plural personality, she operates in a pluralistic mode. . . . Not only does she sustain contradictions, she turns the ambivalence into something else. (79; emphasis in the original) Both Rosaldo and Pratt, in their different ways, have extended the analysis to account for contact zones between cultures (Pratt) and intracultural differences (Rosaldo). The result has been a reassessment of the borderlands paradigm that was already gaining force in the Chicano/a critical discourse of the early 1980s, a reassessment that has carried the border beyond its topo graphic emplacement.11 As Ruben Medina already claimed in a 1986 poem "A donde quiera que vayas / este pais es una frontera" (30). The border is everywhere; there is no such thing as a global village: what we live with is a global border, and it is with this context in mind that I now offer a reading of Morales's latest work. Plagues is a very ambitious novel, touching upon ecological issues, metaliterary questions (including a discussion of literary markets), a medical and social discussion of disease and epi demics (this is probably the first Chicano/a novel to openly deal with AIDS), history, autobiog raphy, science fiction, racism, culture, and mestizaje. The novel is divided into three books entitled respectively "Mexico City," "Delhi," and "LAMEX." The three parts take place around the Mexico City/Los Angeles axis in different epochs.12 The first book, "Mexico City," deals with a strange disease in eighteenth-century New Spain, popularly know as "La Mona." To combat the epidemic, a doctor from Spain (Don</page><page sequence="5">90 MANUEL M. MARTIN-RODRIGUEZ Gregorio Revueltas) is summoned to Mexico City. Dr. Revueltas fights the plague as best he can, but with little success. In the process, he becomes so involved with his new experiences that he starts forgetting about his old life in Spain (including in this oblivion his own family and his betrothed, Renata), while he grows more and more comfortable with life in New Spain and with the company of the maimed Father Jude and his Mexican home and servants. This first part of the novel ends with Dr. Revueltas's refusal to go back to Spain with Renata (who had come to visit him) and the outgoing viceroy; instead, he stays in the home of the late Father Jude, raising Monica Marisela, the offspring of an affair of the viceroy with a Mexican woman. The second book, "Delhi," deals with a descendant of Don Gregorio, another doctor named Gregory Revueltas. His story takes place in present-day Los Angeles, where he falls in love with Sandra Spear, an actress of Jewish descent. They lose the baby she was expecting, and soon after they discover that Sandra has AIDS. Her condition results in the loss of her job, as well as of many of her friends, except for the loyal companions from Delhi (a Los Angeles bar rio). When her condition worsens and she is denied treatment in U.S. hospitals, they seek a cure in Mexico City, where Sandra is taught to accept love and physical decay. Back in the United States, she finally dies surrounded by her family, Gregory, and their friends from Delhi. In book three, "LAMEX," the plot centers around yet another descendant of Gregory and Don Gregorio, a third doctor whose name is also Gregory Revueltas. He lives in his grandfa ther's home, torn between his devotion to the past (symbolized by books) and his duties in the present (as medical director of the LAMEX Health Corridor in the second half of the twenty-first century). Together with his lover, Gaby Chung, he fights several plagues, among them one for which he actually discovers a cure: blood transfusions from Mexico City Mexicans. When the curative powers of their blood are ascertained, Mexicans become a sought-after commodity, and everybody wants to have his/her own MCM (Mexico City Mexican) in residence, much as one keeps drugs in the bathroom medicine chest. After the outbreak subsides, Gregory is demoted and then promoted again when Mexican-dominated areas become stronger and gain some political power. Gaby, on the other hand, cannot bear the pain of a failed implant (she is one of many who has had a forearm replaced by a robotic device) and commits suicide. The three books are held together by several elements, some of which have already been mentioned (a similar space, several generations of the same family, their profession, epidemics, etc.) and some others that would be worth mentioning now. One of the most interesting parallels resides in the fact that all three books contain a tragic love story that ends in the painful death of the female protagonists (Marisela, Sandra, and Gaby). As for the male protagonists, aside from being doctors and sharing the same name, they are all writers, and the last two are also readers of their ancestors' writings (Don Gregorio, in part one, writes a journal while Gregory, in part two, turns out to be a novelist?something the reader learns about in part three). All three of them remain childless at the end of their respective books, in spite of the fact that they are said to be descendants of one another (or, at least, it is implied so). Finally, the three of them have regular visions of previous ancestors: the ghostlike apparitions of Papa Damian and Grandfather Gregorio/Gregory who, in a manner somewhat reminiscent of the anthropomorphic figure of Death in B. Traven's Macario, help them cope with whatever medical problem they are dealing with.13 Certainly, the structural similarities are stronger between parts one and three (in spite of their chronological distance), since they deal with devastating plagues and their effect on the re gion's population, rather than with just one individual victim of the disease, as does part two. Not surprisingly, then, the feeling of deja vu, deja vecu, is frequently experienced by the charac ters in part three (as is the deja lu effect exploited to make the reader connect episodes and make certain inferences).14</page><page sequence="6">THE GLOBAL BORDER 91 One of those inferences entails a certain awareness of historical repetition, for Plagues pre sents a vision of history close to the Nietzschean notion of eternal return. In this sense, the three Gregorys are one, as is the plague that reappears with different names throughout the book, and as is the space in which the three stories take place.15 What changes in the picture is, of course, the material conditions surrounding the protagonists: the power relations in the three centuries, the coming together of different cultures, the characters' perception of themselves, and so on. Historical narration in Plagues is no longer the progressive chronological account of events that constituted Brick People, or even Reto. What Plagues presents is a rhizomatic history, one in which we can enter or leave at any particular point, a history composed of flashes, greatly de void of causality. This notion of history, as I have suggested elsewhere, is due to the fact that Plagues is one of several recent Chicano/a novels whose focus has shifted from epistemology (what the truth is about the Chicano/a experience, how history can be rewritten to account for the suppressed Chicano/a point of view, etc.) to ontology (how to create a world or worlds).16 As I illustrated there, ontologically oriented novels embark upon their rearranging of time and space in a manner not unlike that which Deleuze and Guattari observe in the rhizome, and I proposed to illustrate the point by entertaining the distinction that they propose between a "tracing" and a "map": What distinguishes the map from the tracing is that it is entirely oriented toward an experimentation in contact with the real. . . . The map is open and con nectable in all of its dimensions; it is detachable, reversible, susceptible to con stant modification. It can be torn, reversed, adapted to any kind of mounting, reworked by an individual, group, or social formation. It can be drawn on a wall, conceived as a work of art, constructed as political action or as meditation. ... A map has multiple entryways, as opposed to the tracing, which always comes back "to the same." The map has to do with performance, whereas the tracing always involves an alleged "competence." (A Thousand Plateaus 12) As this quote implies, in rhizomatic worlds maps tend to be inverted, open to continuous and unpredictable rearrangings. Individuals alter maps in their daily existence: transformation, rather than fixation, is the key. This quality is what allows the denizens of the Lower Life Existence Concentration of El Mar de Villas, in the third book of Plagues, to constantly reinvent the space they inhabit, rendering the official tracing of their city meaningless. Thus, for instance, they ap propriate for themselves a wide street that at one time functioned as a freeway. But after the ecological disasters and demographic change in the Los Angeles area, nobody wanted to get to where the freeway led. It was a road abandoned to gradual decay. (173) After they take over the previously abandoned space, they proceed to reconfigure it, guided only by their ability to recycle the old, to rearrange life, as well as to redecorate and regenerate everything that is left from the past. In doing so, they render their habitat unrecognizable (untraceable) and fascinating. Thus, the protagonist/narrator is understandably mesmerized when he enters this world accompanied by an indispensable guide (Don Antonio): Access to the center of El Mar de Villas was through a colorful passage of dancing descansos for the dead. Beyond them there was life, crowded into small quarters, existing happily. As we walked through the residence areas, I noticed the severe concentration of humanity in each unit, every bit of space compart mentalized and livable. Even more amazing was the universal profusion of color that decorated every object deep in El Mar de Villas and which made us walk</page><page sequence="7">92 MANUEL M. MARTIN-RODRIGUEZ slower as we penetrated to the heart of the Lower Life Existance [sic] Concen tration. "Your eyes will adjust to the chromatics," don Antonio said as he acknowl edged the people who bowed their heads as he passed. (173; emphasis in the original) In their constant transformation of old materials into something new (making windows out of discarded glass bottles, for instance), the citizens of El Mar de Villas not only solve a particu lar everyday-life problem but they also present us with a new understanding of culture and poli tics. As Rosaldo has remarked in his critique of Cora Du Bois, the garage sale (as opposed to the museum) "provides a precise image for the postcolonial situation where cultural artifacts flow between unlikely places, and nothing is sacred, permanent or sealed off (44); someone's discarded bottle is someone else's window or yet someone else's piece of art: "What struck me were the brilliant windows made from the glass of broken bottles" (Plagues 173), says the narrator upon first seeing them. El Mar de Villas is a huge garage sale turned city, a postcolonial heterotopia. But deterritorialization and remapping of the kind exemplified here are not limited to this third and final book of Plagues, as we shall immediately see. Rather, they become the main trait in all three parts of the novel. The cultural and geographical space invoked in them is multiple while remaining the same; that is, Mexico City and Los Angeles are the constant referents, but they remain constant only insofar as they change and adapt themselves to transcultural shifts along three specific historical moments. Thus, the first book, "Mexico City," narrates the com ing together of Spain?then the colonial power?and the New Spain, in a way in which both cultural and geographical spheres end up modifying each other. This is clearly symbolized in Don Gregorio's refusal to return to his native Spain at the end of the book; as Don Gregorio himself puts it, "I waved once and walked away from Renata's and Don Juan Vicente's Spain" (66), a Spain whose essence is further destabilized by placing Gregorio's fiancee (Renata) and the demented viceroy (Don Juan Vicente) aboard a ship in this scene. Similarly, the second book?while invoking India in its title?engages in a cultural remap ping of present-day Los Angeles.17 This is most obviously represented in the mixed-race couple formed by Gregory and Sandra, but also in the symbolic takeover of the Orange County Center by the Delhi barrio homeboys, on the occasion of Sandra's performance in a play by Lorca (notice, once again, a transcultural element in the fact that the play was written by a Spanish author). Equally important is Gregory's meditation when they visit Mexico City: Enchanted by the city, we eagerly allowed our minds to be invaded by a kind of a collective hypnosis. A reverie brought about by a continuous differentiation of the old and the new, . . . and the faces of people who represented nomadic Mesoamerican, European, African and Asian cultures. These were the Mexicans, inheritors of the world's cultural tribes. (115) Although this may, at first, resemble the raza cosmica notion first proposed by Jose Vasconcelos and later embraced by many during the Chicano movement, and despite the fact that it reads very much like one of the common trips to Mexico by Chicano/a characters in search of their roots, it is clear that the mestizaje described here is not the synthetic fusion of all races that Vasconcelos envisioned, but a more destabilizing and irresoluble one. Roots and traditional culture are not in voked here in order to provide a safe anchor, but rather to emphasize change, transformation, and transculturation as it affects even those roots. Thus, when Sandra is treated by a Mexican curandera in Tepotzotlan (the site also for much of part one), "The curandera, dressed in flam boyant crimson colors, her face painted like a whore, was not what I expected" (122; emphasis</page><page sequence="8">THE GLOBAL BORDER 93 in the original), the narrator tells us. Indeed, Mexican culture and mestizaje are not presented here as the never-changing roots to which one could go back whenever in need of cultural affir mation. They are not a product, but a process; they are a hybrid in mutation, rather than a static essence. This newer perception of roots is by no means exclusive to Chicano/a literature. It is also found in the literature of other minority groups and reflects, as I have suggested, a newer understanding of cultural history. An illuminating example, in a more ironic vein, is found in the poem "the africa in pedro morejon" [sic] by the Nuyorican poet (of Afro-Caribbean descent) Tato Laviera. In the poem, the poetic voice confronts the issue of a changed Africa, of the cul turally hybrid root: yes, we preserved what was originally african, or have we expanded it? i wonder if we have committed the sin of blending? but i also hear that AFRICANS love electric guitars clearly mis understanding they are the root, or is it me who is primitive? damn it, it is complicated.18 (43) Like Laviera's Africa, the already changed Mexico that we find in part two of Plagues is still further diversified in the third book when it becomes a section of the LAMEX Coastal Region of the Triple Alliance, a geopolitical entity that prefigures and goes beyond post-NAFTA North America. It is here that aspects of the past coexist with genetic experimentation and ecological disasters to alter our perception of the quotidian. This is clearly symbolized by Gaby's constant recharging of her robotic arm. Throughout this third book, the tension between old-fashioned humanistic values (kept alive in the person of the narrator) and a sort of technological "brave new world" is maintained. The somewhat satiric end of the novel (in which Mexican blood is found to be an antidote against the plagues that infect the LAMEX corridor and in which the narrator is appointed "advisor to the Man-god of El Mar de Villas, and the director of its political and paramilitary sectors" [199]) becomes an extension of this tension between the old order (reterritorialization) and the new deterritorialized world. The tension is never completely resolved. Thus, the narrator describes himself in the following reterritorializing and nostalgic fashion in the final paragraph: I am not longer me. I am transfigured into all those that have gone before me: my progenitors, my hopeful ever-surviving race. From the deepest part of my being there rushes to the surface of my almond shaped eyes an ancient tear. (200) While this description (full of references to and reverence for the Amerindian past) reminds us of Morales' s dedicatoria in Caras and inserts us as readers into the nostalgic discourse of reverence for the past that was very dear to the Chicano movement, it is interesting to note how its force is challenged by a different type of discourse in the paragraph that precedes it. But before getting into that other paragraph, let us notice that for all the narrator's insistence on genealogy and family tradition, he is the first narrator/character to remain heirless at the end.19 In this sense, he seems to represent the end of a certain world (that to which he clings so insistently) and cannot serve as an indication of worlds to come. This role is symbolically transferred in the preceding paragraph to Ted and Amalia Chen's baby, the offspring of an environmentally conscious and racially mixed marriage (Ted is a third-generation Chinese American and Amalia a native Mexican Californian).20 While they agonized for a while over whether or not to have children</page><page sequence="9">94 MANUEL M. MARTIN-RODRIGUEZ (149), Amalia eventually gives birth to a child (whose gender is not revealed in the novel), prompting the narrator to assert: From up here, surrounded by thousands of books, I wonder when will I have time to love a woman and have children, like normal people did in the late twen tieth century. I can only protect and enjoy Ted and Amalia's baby, for that child represents the hope for the new millennium. (200) A similar hope was found at the end of part one, when Don Gregorio expressed his affection for M6nica Marisela, the daughter of Marisela (a Mexican woman) and Don Juan Vicente (the Spanish viceroy): I kissed M6nica Marisela and I heard liberation in her innocent giggle, which of fered a new century in my new country. The afternoon sun passed over my face; perhaps that was the cause of the tear running down my cheek; perhaps it was an older, more ancient tear, traveling through those who had come before me. (66) Hope is, once again, portrayed here as the coming together of two worlds in one individual. Therefore, the key to (cultural and/or racial) survival is not seen in the preservation of un changed traditions and customs (or racial or ethnic purity, for that matter) but, rather, in their constant transformation and adaptation, in the continual crossing of new borders and in the con tinuous generation of new paradigms. What Plagues celebrates is continuous mestizaje: between Mexicans and Spaniards (in part one), between Mexican Americans and Jews (in part two), and between Mexican Americans and Asian Americans (in part three). But this mestizaje, as we saw, no longer stems from the notion of an eventual product, Vasconcelos's raza cosmica. Rather, the emphasis is on the process, on what Paul Gilroy, extending Deleuze and Guattari's idea of the rhizome, has called "rhizomorphic, routed, diaspora cultures" (28). Deterritorialization rather than territorialization, diaspora rather than settlement, "becoming" rather than essentially being are the key elements of this new discourse in which Plagues can be inserted alongside Ron Arias's The Road to Tamazunchale, Ana Castillo's Sapogonia, and Gloria Anzaldua's Borderlands, to give some other examples of texts by Chicanos/as.21 In this contest, the switch to English in Morales' s works can also be seen as part of this in tellectual transformation. The language change not only implies a desire to reach a larger audi ence, as Morales himself acknowledged, but it also entails a destabilization of the strategic use of Spanish as a reterritorializing language (as it was often used during the Chicano movement). At the same time, it involves a further deterritorialization because the English he uses is a "becoming minoritarian" English, not only through the use of Spanish structures or words,22 but also because it inserts minority voices inside the hegemonic language and gives new blood to U.S. literature in English (much as the Mexico City Mexicans give new blood to their fellow lamexians in part three). This is no longer English, it is Chicano/a English. Likewise, Morales's characters in Plagues are no longer Spaniards, nor Mexicans, nor Chicanos/as, nor Asian Americans, but rather they are a "becoming" something else. They are de-essentialized and situated in the "contact zones" that make them others without ceasing to be themselves.23 Thus, when Don Gregorio (in part one) is first visited by the ghost of Grandfather Gregorio and Papa Damian, he is amazed at how easily he can cross the spatial, cultural, and temporal border that separates them: With the old man leading, we traveled together. Gregorio and I moved as one in the same person, viewing the world from within each other. We were astonished with the marvels of our worlds, amazed at the facility of stepping through one another into another time, place, situation, and the people we loved. (23-24)</page><page sequence="10">THE GLOBAL BORDER 95 After that night, his scorn for everything Mexican starts to subside, culminating as we saw in his embracing New Spain as his new home. Something similar occurs in the description of Sandra's symbolic acceptance into Mexican Chicano/a culture in part two. When she is being cured in Tepotzotlan, in a setting that combines pre-Hispanic, Greek, and colonial symbols: "They dressed her in clothes which were many col ored and expressed the Indian and modern dress. Her dress was transcultural, transhistoricar (125; emphasis added). An analogous dress, by the way, is donned by the Delhi homeboys, whose quilted jackets combine past and present, Mexico (la Virgen de Guadalupe), and the U.S. Mexican (lowriding) culture together, symbolizing once again cultural coexistence and juxtapo sition, rather than homogeneity (88). Needless to say, contact zones are quite common in part three as we saw when we discussed mixed marriages, and they can be very well represented by Gaby, whose body is already part human part something else. But in this final book, the reflection on cultural hybridism and cul tural contact becomes metaliterary when we learn that cultural transformation is also the main fo cus of Gregory's grandfather's novels. One of them, significantly entitled A Rainbow of Colors, narrates the life of a French boy who becomes transculturized while in Japan.24 Another novel, entitled The Rag Doll Plagues, creates a sort of mise en abtme while destabilizing Morales's own text by appropriating its title. When Gregory (in part three) reads it, he feels "he had written about me" (192). Perhaps he sees himself in a paragraph in which his grandfather Gregory describes the experience of personal fragmentation: Finally, my breath came back and I stood against the setting sun and saw my shadow shattered on her [Sandra's] Peruvian rug. I struggled to recapture my fragmented being, piece by piece. I proceeded without an essence.25 (79) Transformation affects, of course, the larger picture as well. When Morales acknowledges an intellectual and technical evolution in his career, I believe that this evolution can be compared to the process of "becoming" something else (transcultural deterritorialization) that I am describ ing. When asked by Grandjeat and Rodriguez about changes in attitude in his recent novels, Morales answered: Now I'm beginning to feel much more comfortable with English, and once you feel more comfortable with a language you begin to feel more at ease within the culture of that language. The anger that you say you notice in my first two nov els can be explained, I believe, by a discomfort I felt with both English and Spanish and their corresponding cultures. Now that's no longer the case because I have experienced an evolution. (Ill) In moving away from a nationalistic, territorializing perception of language and culture, Morales has, I believe, advanced in his work towards what Deleuze and Guattari call "conquering one's language": That is the strength of authors termed "minor," who are in fact the greatest, the only greats: having to conquer one's language, in other words, to attain that so briety in the use of a major language, in order to place it in a state of continuous variation (the opposite of regionalism). It is in one's own language that one is bilingual or multilingual. Conquer the major language in order to delineate in it as yet unknown minor languages. Use the minor language to send the major language racing. Minor authors are foreigners in their own tongue. (105; em phasis in the original)</page><page sequence="11">96 MANUEL M. MARTIN-RODRIGUEZ In so doing, Morales has also found a way to narrate about the newer realities of the 1990s with solid and convincing force. Cultural hybridism, transnationalism, rhizomorphic identities, the colonial and the postcolonial, the center and the periphery, the inherited and the created cul ture, these are all brought together in this novel whose shifting referents are deterritorialized re minders of a global remapping. Rather than an elaboration of the global village paradigm, what we find in Plagues is a development of the concept of the global border and of its inhabitants' languages and cultures. This world consists of a transnational space in which cultural contact does not result in a progressive homogenization, but in an expansion and multiplication of bor ders, a perpetual re(b)ordering that engenders newer cultural configurations. These, in turn, precipitate a "becoming minoritarian" of the hegemonic cultures and languages with which they enter in contact. Algerian immigrants in France, Moroccans and Guineans in Spain, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in the United States, they all leave their mark in the cultures of the coun tries where they come to reside (or where their ancestors already resided), while transforming the culture that they brought with them. In a similar way, rhizomatic spaces such as the one found in Plagues (or the one that Morales has described as the setting for his next novel)26 result from a narrative figuration of the global border: the emphasis no longer rests on reclaiming the lost land (or the "lost" language) in order to reterritorialize collective identity; instead, novels such as Plagues set out to imagine and uncover new deterritorialized spaces that may serve as paradigms for novel identities. YALE UNIVERSITY Notes *My efforts in this regard have resulted in the edition of La voz urgente: Antologi'a de literatura chicana en espanol, among other publications on the subject. At Yale, I regularly teach graduate seminars on Chicano/a literature written in Spanish. 2Evodio Escalante, for instance, expressed some doubts in 1976: "Es cierto que [este libro] ha sido escrito en espanol, o en algo que parece espanol." Another Mexican critic, Eduardo Mejia, had even harsher words for Morales in a book review from the same year: "Decfa que esta obra tiene errores, sin embargo, se advierte que el autor es un buen novelista y las fallas surgen del desconocimiento del espanol. Incapaces de manejar el ingles, los chicanos han intentado reconstruirse un idioma que no sienten suyo" (both quotes appear in Rodriguez del Pino [87], and for more information on the early reception of this novel, see 86-89). 3See my "Deterritorialization and Heterotopia." 4Most of the information on Alejandro Morales that I will use in this essay stems from conversations and correspondence with the author over the years. For further biographical information, including details about the prepublication of Caras, see Rodriguez del Pino (67-70). 5 Here is what Morales has said about the shift, in an interview with Grandjeat and Rodriguez: "In using two languages like in Reto en el paraiso, the audience is very limited, so I had to change that. So in The Brick People, since the story is so important and so personal to me, I wanted it to be read by as many people as pos sible. Thus, I had to resort to English" (111). As I hinted earlier, I will try to prove in this essay that there are other reasons and consequences of that language shift that will help us, as critics and readers, understand it better. interview with Grandjeat and Rodriguez (113). 7Brian McHale's postulates can be found in Postmodernist Fiction. As one example of Morales's playful in tertextual dialogue with Latin American authors, see Brick People (175), where the protagonist plays cards with Pierre Menard (a title character from a story by Borges) and Federico Robles (a character in La region mas trans parente by Carlos Fuentes), among others. This episode is also a wink to McHale, who calls this borrowing of characters "transworld identity" (17), and to Fuentes, once again, because he had used a similar technique in Terra Nostra.</page><page sequence="12">THE GLOBAL BORDER 97 8"Deterritorialization and Heterotopia," passim. 9For an analysis of these transgressions, see my "El sentimiento de culpa en Reto en el paraiso" 10The same could be said, to a certain extent, of some characters in Brick People. Morales has discussed this in relation to a search for a better life: "These characters [in Brick People] were very well aware of a better life. And of course the better life was represented by all Anglo Montebello. It was the same relationship between Mexico and the United States. It was another type of border, although in Simens [sic] they had everything" (Interview with Grandjeat and Rodriguez, 114). 1 lrThus, it is not surprising to find out in Plagues that "about twenty years after the turn of the [twenty-first] century, the border became stabilized and eventually abolished" (151). *2There is also a deliberate attempt to use different styles in each part of the book in order to convey a lin guistic sense of time and place, a technique that Morales implies that he learned from Alejo Carpentier (Interview with Grandjeat and Rodriguez, 112). While Morales is largely successful in his attempt, a better editing of Plagues would have avoided some vocabulary problems (particularly in the first book) that put his intentions at risk. Thus, for instance, it is highly unlikely that an eighteenth-century Spaniard (Don Gregorio) would feel the need to explain in his narration what petacas are and that, on the day of his arrival in New Spain, he would already know what Mexican tortillas were and what they were called (12-13). Likewise, a sentence like "Later that evening, I discovered that for months, the family had lobbied Renata's father to give his blessing to our union" (18; emphasis added) sounds extremely out of time. 13There are, to be sure, many other similarities, among them the recurring motif of the almond-shaped eyes, the ancient tear that surfaces in the protagonists' eyes at the end of each book, and others that I will discuss when necessary. Of interest is the fact that the prepublished manuscript was entitled The Ancient Tear (Morales, Inter view, ill). I4In passing, it should also be noted that some of the names in this novel suggest a connection with Morales's own family history. This is clear in his use of the last name Revueltas as well as of the first name Gregory (that of Morales's own son). Other motifs, including references to Simons and Morales' s constant inter est in the medical profession, serve to connect Plagues with previous novels by the author. 15The repetition of the past as seen in the succession of generations in one family is a recurring motif in the works of Morales. In a passage of Caras that looks like a sketch for the structure of Plagues we read: "Ellos tam bien habfan sufrido; tema orgullo de los parientes. El sabia que otro exactamente como el habia existido en aquel entonces; era su gemelo que tenia un gemelo anterior a el. Hubo otros como el y los queria y los sentia. Hablaban del viaje, lo describfan en detalle, con carino, los difuntos de ese viaje aparecfan y llenaban el ruido con silencio" (45). Something similar occurs in Reto where, in addition, members of different generations share the same name, as occurs in Plagues. 16See my "Deterritorialization and Heterotopia." The distinction between ontologically and epistemologically oriented novels is based on a similar idea by McHale (3-25). 17While "Delhi" is a section of Los Angeles, I would claim that its name still retains the suggestion of the Indian city. 18A very illuminating discussion of similar issues as they apply to African American cultures can be found in Gilroy, The Black Atlantic, 19-29 and 72-110. 19Although there is no textual evidence that either Don Gregorio (in part one) or Gregory (in part two) ever beget children, the fact that Gregory (in part three) is their descendant implies that they did so. In a different read ing, of course, they all would be the same (childless) person living in different times. 20This type of "cross-cultural, racial marriages . . . between Asians and Mexicans" is said to have become very common by the year 2020 (148). 21 For a consideration of Plagues in the context of this group of works, see my "Deterritorialization and Heterotopia." 22Such as "In that church I was baptized, made my First Communion and my Confirmation" (73-74; empha sis added) and others. 23I am borrowing the term "contact zone" from M. L. Pratt, who defines it as "an attempt to invoke the spa tial and temporal copresence of subjects previously separated by geographic and historical disjunctures, and whose trajectories now intersect" (7). 24The plot summary of this novel coincides with that of Morales's next novel as described to Grandjeat and Rodriguez (110). 25A somewhat similar description of loss of unity (as a liberating experience) can already be found in Reto, when Antonio Berreyesa Coronel enters "El tunel de la luz": "Siguio la lfnea roja hasta que oyo los ruidos de los candados. Volteo para ver una infinidad de repeticiones de gemelos suyos. Los reflejos formaban el estallido de un</page><page sequence="13">98 MANUEL M.

As mentioned, Reto, more than Brick People, is an antecedent of Plagues with respect to issues such as identity, transgression, and others that we are exploring here. 26About a French boy who grows up in Japan.
