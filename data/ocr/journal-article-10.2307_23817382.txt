<plain_text><page sequence="1">61 THE CONTENT AND CONTEXT OF MAMPRUSI "SOLIMA": AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF MAMPRUSI STORIES SUSAN DRUCKER-BROWN AND RACHEL NAYLER This paper analyzes a collection of Mamprusi "folktales" and is also a response to some of the ideas presented by Jack Goody (1971/1993) in a discussion of similar stories which he and Esther Goody collected in the Gonja and Lodagaa regions of northern Ghana. The Mamprusi people also live in northern Ghana where the Gonja and Lodagaa are their neighbours to the north and the west, respectively. Prior to the colonial period the Mamprusi, like the Gonja, were a dominant minority in a weakly centralized kingdom for which they provided the king and royal chiefs. (See Goody: 1993; Drucker-Brown: 1975, 1989.) The Lodagaa, by contrast with both Gonja and Mamprusi peoples, had no specialized political structures. The stories which are the subject of Goody's discussion are, in many formal respects which are mentioned below, identical to the Mamprusi stories discussed here. To what extent the content varies, we cannot tell since his paper makes little reference to content. The core of Goody's paper is a statistical analysis of the various characters (animals, men and gods) who appear in the stories. He presents tables comparing the frequency with which certain of the characters appear in Gonja and Lodagaa tales, and finds that roughly the same percentage of the same characters appear in stories from both groups. He then concludes that the stories told by both peoples are very similar despite major differences in the two political traditions. He does not analyze the content of the stories as an expression of cultural values which might have political significance, but observes that these tales (p. 13) "are largely directed towards the young and those who need to be entertained., (and where they are more than entertainment) a didactive element is visible in the moral tacked onto the end and often only tenuously derived from the story." He notes that "the emphasis tends to place in primary focus those characters who stand as the fons et origo of their different domains, that is, the chief for men, God for gods, and (in a Cambridge Anthropology, 16: 3,1992/1993</page><page sequence="2">62 Drucker-Brown, Nayler different sense) spider for the animals", but Goody sees the structure of the stories as derived more from "the context of communication than the nature of the polity" and he argues that the stories "form part of a pool of narratives which circulate over a geographical region, like novels in western society today and folktales in times gone by". Part of our analysis of the Mamprusi tales seeks to show that "the context of communication" is related to the nature of the polity and does reflect the specific concerns of the local population. Goody complains, in the introduction to his paper, that analyses of such tales are bedevilled by problems which include: a poverty of data, inadequate recording of oral literatures, lack of linguistic knowledge on the part of recorders or analysts, ignorance of the contexts of recitation, and confusion between frames of reference and frames of explanation. He regards the "mystery of myth" as partly the result of "poor canons of enquiry" used in the investigation of "oral narrative"; the term he uses to categorize these stories "in order to get round the problem of distinguishing between myth and folktale". Goody does however, indicate that he considers the stories he is dealing with as closer to "folktale" than to "myth". It should be noted that Goody wrote his piece in 1971 when the powerful impact of the work of Levi-Strauss was changing the direction of much British Social Anthropology, replacing a concern with wide ranges of behaviour and belief with a much more intensive concentration on "systems of thought" in which "Myth" occupies a central place. Goody's complaint, though it nowhere mentions Levi Strauss, can be seen, I believe, as an expression of irritation with structuralist interpretations of "oral narrative" which, given a structural functionalist frame of reference, may be said to pay no attention to behavioural context, or the distinction between actors' and observers' frames of reference and to suffer from other of the omissions Goody mentions. This paper uses the folktale-myth continuum proposed by Kirk (1970) and mentioned by Goody, to place the Mamprusi "solima" in the context of other Mamprusi oral narrative. We then look carefully at the manner in which the solima are performed and finally we examine some aspects of the narrative content of the stories. Goody himself notes that his material would profit from "a more sophisticated thematic analysis". We lack the space to reproduce texts here, and thus, cannot present a sophisticated thematic analysis but the results of a cursory inspection of our collection of solima lead us to contest Goody's conclusion that the content of these stories bears no relation to political tradition. Like the context in which they are performed, it seems to us that the stories</page><page sequence="3">Mamprusi "Solima" 63 reflect significant concerns in the everyday life of Mamprusi people some of which are clearly political. The Solima, folktale or myth? Kirk (1970) suggests that "myth" can be used as a blanket term for narrative tales of all types, but that narratives can valuably be classified thematically by use of a continuum: Folktale Myth The continuum is characterized by the following contrasts: folktale is set in a historical past, while myth is set in a timeless past, folktale lacks specific local reference; for example, characters are un-named, while myth contains specific local references and named characters. Folktales are about trickery where myth is about unpredictable individual reactions. In folktale, one event leads naturally to another while in myth, action is complicated. In folktale the characters are often humble and achieve their purpose with ingenuity while in myth the main characters are often superhuman or become "culture heroes". Finally, folktales are about wish fulfilment, while in myth, a supernatural element produces drastic changes to the action. The Mamprusi narratives to be analyzed here, belong at the folktale rather than at the myth end of Kirk's continuum. The characters are never named, the plot is always clear and events move fast. The characters' purpose, which is always recognizably human though the character may not be, is accomplished through trickery or ingenuity with a dose of the miraculous thrown in, but divinity does not move events. Impossible events occur as though they were normal, without the explicit intervention of any supernatural agency; people are transformed into animals or objects, animals speak, objects perform actions normally performed by humans, and no explanation is offered for how these things occur. Wishes tend to be fulfilled for the good and the clever, while the stupid and evil or the over-clever, come to grief. (See illustrations by Mamprusi children who spontaneously drew chameleon and spider farming.) On the other hand, the stories are not set in a historical past. They are set in their own time, which is signalled by the phrase with which the narrative begins: "Nsolini bene" (literally: "a story"/solini, "is there"/bene). This is an equivalent of "Once upon a time". It seems to imply that the stories exist independent of their telling and like the English "Once upon a time", "Nsolini bene" tells the listener to expect a particular type of narrative. Bizarre and amusing things will happen. The characters will range from human through animal, to normally inanimate objects (calabash, cane, broom) and features of the natural</page><page sequence="4">64 Drucker-Brown, Nayler environment (rain, river, fire). Body parts may figure independently of the complete human person (penis and vagina, in particular). Animal characters often epitomize human qualities and human predicaments are often associated with these specific qualities. The form of the solima is also predictable. We have already mentioned that the introductory phrase is always the same. The solima will probably be no more than five minutes long and at some point in the narrative there will be a musical refrain which everyone will join in singing; the narrator singing the lines which change and the audience responding with a chorus. At the end there will be a final phrase of "summing up". It may be what Goody calls "the moral"; a sentence which advises the listener ("that is why you should not do things you don't understand" or "that is why you should not favour one of your children over another"), but it may be a reference to the state of things in the real world which the story explains ("and that is why there are birds all over the world"), but most frequently it is a justification of the story teller's tale ("and if you think I'm telling lies, bang your head against the wall and you will see stars") or a rhyming phrase of uncertain meaning; "My story twists" (nsolini golin), which refers, like the previous phrase, only to the story itself. These formal characteristics of the stories Mamprusi call "solima" (sing, solini, pi. solima); a standardized beginning and ending, a musical refrain, and a brief but fast-moving narrative involving a wide range of characters but including stereotyped personalities who often reappear in similar predicaments, clearly distinguish these stories from all other Mamprusi oral narrative. It would seem reasonable to call them "folk-tale solima". There are, however, other "narratives" Mamprusi call "solima" and the special quality of the "folk-tale solima" becomes clearer in contrast to these. A second type of solima is much closer to the myth than to the folktale end of Kirk's continuum. This second type might be called "praise-name solima". Such solima are similar, and indeed may be considered among the names (sing, yuri, pi. yuya) which designate families, usually patrilineal lineages or entire clans, but sometimes linked kin groups with a common place of origin. Mamprusi say of these solima that they are about "origins" (piligu) and they celebrate in a brief reference, only a word or two, the origins of groups of people. Individual praise names are performed by drummers or violinists but the praise-name solima are distinct from the individual names. They are shouted by women who accompany the word or phrase which constitutes the solima, with an ullulating cry. These performances are part of the highly competitive, individualistic display which occurs during all public Mamprusi ceremony; funerals, calendrical rituals, and</page><page sequence="5">Mamprusi "Solima" 65 other court occasions. Though code words or phrases which constitute the solima, may be well known as referring to particular persons the "deeper meaning" of a solima is its reference to a unique event or series of events recounted in a much longer tale of ancestral deeds. Such solima involve names and un-named ancestors and often commemorate the special relationship between kin groups and animals which it is prohibited for members of that group to eat. Thus, an individual may be praised as "sisiriga-biia" (literally, "Squirrel's child") or Muslim patronymics may be used (Sisi, Taroare). Such aspects of the praise name solima are public knowledge, but the deeper, private meaning of a solima will be known only to individuals for whom the solima is used. For them this praise-name solima is a family secret which, like the secular folk-tale solima, gives pleasure in the telling but, unlike the folk tale solima, contains private references which will be unknown to outsiders. If the folktale solima and the praise-name solima can be located towards opposite ends of the folktale-myth continuum, there is a further category of Mamprusi solima which might be said to approach myth more closely. This is the category of "royal names" (naam yuya) which constitute the esoteric knowledge of kingship and royal chiefship. Such knowledge is, in its constituent segments, the property of individual royals and is known to them and to their families. As a whole, however, "naam-yuya" is known only to the praise-singers (baamsi) who perform at state occasions. These occasions range from the most secret rituals to the most public. The narratives consist almost entirely of names which are a record of the origin and history of the kingship. They include names of ancient kings who are prototypes of particular kinds of rule; wicked, wize, rebellious against the elders, all-conquering, usurping. Also contained are the names and succession histories of living royals, which are crucial to the ongoing competition for office. The narrative is described as "heavy" (tibsa) and no single one of the names should be mentioned without appropriate sacrifice, or by unauthorized persons. In the secrecy surrounding the knowledge it encapsulates, and in its reference to the origins of the royal clan, the kingship-names share features of the praise-name solima. Like those, the kingship names are performed by specialists, in praise of ancestors, and have both a private and public face in which political rank and ritual obligation are implicated. In these aspects the prasie-name solima and the kingship names would seem to be clearly contrasted with the folk-tale solima. However, both the praise-name solima and the kingship-names are coded phrases or words in their public form, but in their deeper meanings they are the secret narratives which share the quality of</page><page sequence="6">66 Drucker-Brown, Nayler dramatic plot with the folk-tale solima. While the folk-tale solima can be told, the tales of family origin and the origins of kings are "hidden behind the names". Moreover, where the praise-name solima and the kingship names are performed in ritualized contexts, involving public display and competition or private sacrifice, the contexts in which folk tale solima are told are typically domestic and egalitarian. Performance of the folk-tale solima Traditionally, the stories we are analyzing here are told during moonlit nights of the dry season in the months following the harvest, when families sit relaxing in the open courtyards which are the social centres of Mamprusi household. That is when most of the stories from the 1960s were collected. It was said then, that telling solima at other times of year was forbidden. Nobody could say exactly why the prohibition should exist, nor was it taken too seriously. It never prevented people from telling solima at other times, if asked by the anthropologist. However, the telling of solima at the right time of year is a relaxed and festive occupation. It may well be that solima are not regarded as appropriate for the anxiety-filled season before the sowing, nor for the fatigue of the farming season and in the rains, the courtyards are deserted, for rainfall is often at night and nights are considered cold. Men claimed that solima were "for women and children". But whenever solima were told men listened as appreciatively as women and also joined in the telling. In the Nayler collection, more stories were told by males than by females, and women outnumbered men as story tellers only in the 50-59 year age group (see fig. 1). Here again, as with the seasonal prohibition, the rules were relaxed and the pleasure derived from the tales was felt to be more important than the proprieties. This is unusual in Mamprusi society where proprieties are very important and deference is always owed by women to men, children to adults, juniors to their seniors. In this context it is important that story-telling, though supposedly for women and children, is not in fact the province of any one group. On the occasions when solima are told, everyone is encouraged to display their knowledge and skills much as everyone participates in the musical refrains which are part of the solima. Extreme differences in skill and experience are clear, yet no-one is silenced because he or she is lacking in either. Though good story-tellers are encouraged to continue, even an outstanding story-teller does not dominate the event. This relaxed and egalitarian atmosphere in which story-telling takes place should be emphasized because it is unusual. It may even be the case that men claim story-telling "is for women and children" precisely because it is an occasion during which male predominance and hierarchy generally, is</page><page sequence="7">Mamprusi "Solima" 67 unrecognized. The uncharacteristically egalitarian atmosphere of their performance is paralleled by the fact that the thematic content of the solima is also often subversive. Many stories poke fun at the pretensions of the powerful while others are about subversion of the natural or social order. One might say that the solima often seem to oppose the very hierarchies which are relaxed in the story telling sessions, or at least they warn the powerful that they may be undermined. Thus, both the content and context might be seen as a counterweight to the hierarchy which is, in other contexts, so highly valued. From the point of view of the children who take part, the fact that anyone can participate is crucial in other ways as well. Mamprusi value verbal skills very highly and the narration of solima is an arena for acquiring and testing these skills. The audience is notably uncritical and suppportive. Mamprusi elders who are also present on these occasions, take careful note of the behaviour of youngsters, for this is still a society in which the elders wield a powerful influence on the life chances of the young. The skills shown in story-telling sessions are surely noted by them. It is not possible here to do more than point to the importance of story-telling in the traditional educational process. It is certainly true, as Goody argues, that Mamprusi stories "are told for entertainment and directed towards the young". However, we would also argue that the manner of the telling has particular meaning in the Mamprusi context which may or may not be shared with neighbouring peoples. The content of the folk-tale solima A recorded collection of 264 Mamprusi solima was made by Rachel Nayler during six weeks of the summer of 1989. Other solima were recorded less systematically, by Susan Drucker-Brown during 1963-65. Consideration of the earlier collection has helped provide suggestions for interpreting the later, and also served to indicate continuities and changes in the content of the stories, features of story-telling and contexts of performance. The 264 stories recorded in 1989 on a cassette recorder, were translated verbatim by Salifo Nantomah, a native Mampruli-speaker, who was present at most of the recording sessions. In a statistical analysis of the 264 stories she collected, Rachel Nayler isolated a total of 284 characters. A "character" was defined as "any person, animal, object or supernatural being which takes an active role in the story". Appendix A shows the number of times a character was mentioned in the stories (total frequency), as well as the number of stories in which each character appears (occasion). Many characters, like hawk and pistol, Allah, or chief's leper, figure only in one story. However, sixteen of the characters have a frequency of 98 appearances,</page><page sequence="8">68 Drucker-Brown, Nayler or more. It is clear from this list, that the most frequently mentioned character was Spider (715) with Chief (476), Hyena (354), Hunter (254), Monkey (190) and Rascal (179) following, in that order. Some of the other characters are defined by their relationship to those most frequently mentioned, so that Spider's children, his in-law, his mother, son, and wife, as well as a "Spider look-alike", and an "elder" appear in the Spider stories. Similarly, Chief stories include Chiefs beloved child and his hated child, his beloved wife, and his hated wife, his beloved wife's son, his junior son and his senior son, his junior wife, his senior wife, his frog-wife, his daughter, mother, and mother-in-law. In addition to those relatives, Chief's leper, Chief's farmers, and Chief's servants appear as well as a "second chief. If the number of stories in which the character appears is compared rather than the total number of appearances, then Chief is present in more than is Spider. This is the basis of the comparison Goody makes of the Lodagaa, and Gonja stories. Table 1 shows the focal characters in the stories compared among the three groups. Table 1 Order Mamprusi Stories LoDagaa Stories Gonja Stories 1 Chief (38%) Spider (30%) Spider (38%) 2 Spider (29%) Man (25%) Woman (25%) Woman/Mother (29%) 3 Bush Animals (19%) Boy (18%) Man/Father (18%) 4 Hyena (17%) Boy (22%) 5 Hunter (13%) Bird (14%) Hyena (14%) Hunter (14%) Child (17%) 6 Chief's Wives (11%) Hyena (15%) Bird (15%) Comparing the characters in Mamprusi stories with those obtained by Goody we find both similarity and difference. Spider is the character who appears in most Gonja and Lodagaa stories. Chief is most frequent among the Mamprusi. However, Chief is followed by Spider among the Mamprusi, while among the Lodagaa it is man and woman, or woman/mother and man/farmer among the Gonja. It is perhaps not suprising (see Appendix A) that many more characters appear in Mamprusi stories, given the larger total number of stories in the Nayler collection compared with the total number of Lodagaa and Gonja</page><page sequence="9">Mamprusi "Solima" 69 stories; though it would be interesting to see if the variety of characters was equally elaborated in the other groups given a larger collection. However, it is consistent with the crucial significance of kingship and chiefship to the Mamprusi, that Chief/king should appear so frequently, and with the greatest variety of associated characters. Chief s entourage is more elaborate than Spider's including as it does, elders, farmers, servants and a leper (Mamprusi regarded deformed persons as "belonging to the king"), and the characterization of Chief s kin suggests a complexity missing from Spider's family. While Spider's kin are son, daughter, mother, mother-in-law, Chiefs family opposes beloved and hated children and beloved and hated wives. Many of the stories in which Chief figures, are, as we shall show, directly related to indigenous Mamprusi traditions of kingship and reflect the tensions of the royal commoner distinction which continues to be important in Mamprusi politics. "Chief" is our translation of the Mampruli "naba" which refers both to chiefs and to the king. It is impossible to tell, when the term is used, whether it refers to a simple village chief or to the king himself. However, the events related in these stories might be said to refer to chiefship/kingship rather than to any particular office-holder. In the story which ends, "And that is why Naba never goes hunting.", a Chief goes hunting and dies, after entering the bush and plunging his hand into a hole in pursuit of game. To understand this story fully, it is important to know that there is a fundamental opposition in Mamprusi politics between Chief and Hunter. Hunter is prototypically non-royal, and associated with the bush, from which he acquires powers which may defend or prove dangerous to Chief. Chief, by contrast, should remain at the centre of inhabited, village space from whence he supervises the activities of his court and people. The powers of Chief and Hunter are complementary and separate from one another; potentially in conflict but above all segregated. If one is aware of this general belief, then other stories, like those of Spider or Old Woman, who build houses in the bush and wield power from there, can be seen to reinforce the same idea as that of the Chief who went hunting; there is power in the bush which counterbalances royal power and it is one which chiefs ignore at their peril. Other stories reflect the tensions between commoners and royals and chronicle the greater power of Chief. These are exemplified by the story of Goat, who builds a beautiful house, larger than that of Chief. On being warned, he refuses to make the house smaller, or to relinquish the design, and Chief eventually destroys the house and takes Goat's property. Other stories contain the same message in a less explicit form.</page><page sequence="10">70 Drucker-Brown, Nayler An example is the story of a competition between Lake (moa'are) and Rain (saa), to see who is senior. Rain wins, because without rain Lake dries up. For Mamprusi, who believe that chiefs can bring or with-hold rain, this is a story of chiefly ascendance. Chief is ultimately stronger than his subjects. Chief controls rain and lakes (often sites at which commoners sacrifice) ultimately depend on rain. The widespread importance of the Spider story deserves some comment. The hero or anti-hero of these stories, a "trickster" type who does outrageous things, has become much more frequent in the Mamprusi solima since the 1960s. Formerly, stories of Hare were perhaps more common. The use of school texts in which Spider stories appear is no doubt of considerable importance here. These texts are the earliest reading matter given to children in the primary schools. Spider stories, which are common to both the north and south of Ghana, seem clearly to have gained in importance. Another aspect of the content of folk-tale solima which has changed since the 1960s is the musical refrain which accompanies them. The number of Christian churches in the Mamprusi area has increased and certain of the primary schools are in fact supported by the protestant churches. The solima music now reflects the rhythm and melodies of hymn tunes introduced by missionaries. Many other stories reflect the tensions which arise in the large, polygynous households of Mamprusi elders and chiefs. They deal with rivalries among co-wives, the plight of motherless children, competition among brothers, and the difficulties of parents in asserting their authority over children; particularly in making daughters accept the husbands chosen for them by their fathers. Mamprusi share these problems with many of their neighbours, including of course, the Gonja and Lodagaa. However, in Mamprusi royal households the domestic tensions mentioned here are often particularly intense; since they may be exacerbated by competition for succession which tends to divide close kin. Many other predicaments, like the problems of coping with death, famine and drought, or the dangers as well as the potential riches to be found in the un-tamed bush, are also dealt with in Mamprusi stories. These, of course, are universal subject matter, shared by Mamprusi with story-tellers much farther afield than northern Ghana. Without a more detailed comparison of the content and context of the Lodagaa and Gonja material, it is difficult to argue in what ways the content and context of the Mamprusi folk-tale solima are shared or relatively unique. Why the Lodagaa peoples, who have no indigenous tradition of chiefship, should nonetheless tell stories about chiefs is a question worth answering. That chiefship might have a different</page><page sequence="11">Mamprusi "Solima" 71 meaning, or even no meaning at all to the Lodagaa is not, of course, evidence that chiefship has no meaning elsewhere. The point we wish to make here is that however universal some of its themes may be, and however common to neighbouring peoples its form and the context of its performance may be, Mamprusi folk-tale solima do have features which are inextricably tied to peculiarly Mamprusi politics and religious beliefs; and a domestic hierarchy all of which are involved with the institution of kingship.
