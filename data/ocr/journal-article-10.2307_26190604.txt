For eight weeks, our survey team visited six deaf communities in the cities of Lima, Arequipa, Cusco, Trujillo, Chiclayo, and Iqui- tos. Using sociolinguistic questionnaires and recorded text testing (RTT) tools, we explored the general social situation of these com- munities, as well as sociolinguistic topics such as ethnolinguistic iden- tity, language vitality and stability, and the attitudes of deaf people toward their local sign variety. We also probed sign language standard- ization and variation in Peru. During background research, we had heard reports that Peruvian Sign Language (LSP) was similar to American Sign Language (ASL), but the responses of the questionnaire participants and comprehension testing of an ASL text in various deaf communities in Peru indicate that ASL is quite different from LSP. Anthropomorphism in Sign Languages: A Look at Poetry and Storytelling with a Focus on British Sign Language The work presented here considers some linguistic methods used in sign anthropomorphism. We find a cline of signed anthropomorphism that depends on a number of factors, including the skills and intention of the signer, the animacy of the entities represented, the form of their bodies, and the form of vocabulary signs referring to those entities. We consider four main factors that allow signers to anthropomorphize the whole range of entities (from animate to inanimate): the linguis- tic base that allows such play, the ability of the nonmanuals to anthro- pomorphize even when the manual articulators are signing in an ordinary way, the range of possibilities for both manual and nonman- ual articulators when the signer engages in (almost) complete embod- iment of the nonhuman character, and how nonhumans are portrayed as communicating via sign language. 504 Sign Language Studies Vol. 10 No. 4 Summer 2010 </page> <page sequence="2"> 17790-SLS10.4  5/27/10  3:23 PM  Page 505 Abstracts | 505 Schoolization: An Account of the Origins of Regional  Variation in British Sign Language British Sign Language has a number of regional variations. This arti- cle examines the role of residential schools in the development of sign variants. Citing data collected during interviews with members of the Lancaster and Morecambe Deaf community (who of necessity at- tended schools elsewhere), it explores the peer-to-peer transmission of sign forms in schools and the influence of these forms in the commu- nities to which the pupils returned on leaving school (coining the term schoolization for this phenomenon). It discusses the effect the closure of such residential schools will have on the acquisition and transmis- sion of BSL. </page> </plain_text>
