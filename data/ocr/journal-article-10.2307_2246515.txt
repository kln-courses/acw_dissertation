<plain_text><page sequence="1">XIII.--NEW BOOKS. An Introduction to the Study of Logic and Metalohysics. By T. S. BArreTT. London: Provost &amp; Co. 1875. A readable little book (pp. 48) not detailed enough to bear out the promise of the title. The author contends for an extension of the scope of Logic in the spirit of Mill and Prof. Bain. He would define it as "The Science of the Conditions of Human Knowledge." Necessity is only to be found in the Principles of Consistency. The author adopts Hume's views of Causation. "Physical Science is really nothing but a collection and a classification of isolated but analogous facts." System of Positive Polity. By AUGUSTE COMTE. Vols. I., II. London: Longmans &amp; Co. 1875. The first volume, translated by J. H. Bridges, M.B., gives the General View of Positivism, or outline of the main features of the system as a Religion based on a Polity, and the discussion of the cosmological and biological bases of Sociology. The second volume, translated by F. Harrison, M.A., contains Social Statics or the Abstract Theory of Human order. With the omission of the preface to the second volume, the original text is reproduced in translation unabridged. Marginal notes and Tables of Contents are added by the translators. Vols. III. and IV., completing the work, are announced to appear shortly. Arthur Schopenhauer: His Life and his Philosophy. By HELEN ZIMMERN. London: Longmans &amp; Co. 1876. The author notes the fact that an Englishman, Mr. Oxenford, in the Westminster Review of 1853, was the first to assign Schopen- bauer a place among the thinkers of the world. Since then his books have been widely read in Germany, and there is a growing curiosity in England to know more about the Philosophy of Pessimism. The author is no blind admirer, and faithfully depicts the character of the great ~:araq~porS~'Opa,~'oc. The book is mainly biographical, only two chapters out of the eleven being devoted to an account of the philosophy. We are told in the preface that "a translation of Schopenhauer's capital treatise is</page><page sequence="2">New Books. 295 contemplated by an accomplished German scholar now resident among us." It is to be hoped that the English will be as readable as that of the present volame. Philosophy wvithout Assumnptions. By T. P. KIRKMAN, M.A., F.R.S. London: Longmans &amp; Co. 1876. According to the author, the only starting-point for a philosophy without assumptions is that of Descartes -" I am a thiniking being." Among the data of self-consciousness is the feeling of exerted energy which we designate Will. Will baffled reveals to us a sphere beyond self. What we term the " external world" is only unknown a, standing for so much restraint on personal activity. To call it " matter," thereby implying entity, is an assumption. Unextended force-loci are allithat we have warrant for, or indeed require for life, theoretical or practical. What need of Atoms, seeing that the physicist treats their force as concentrated in a spaceless " centre of gravity ?" The thinker believes that other minds exist from the absurdity of doubting the theorem. "All continued and consistent phenomenal indications of invisible consciousness, intelligence, and will, are verily to me demonstra- tions of the unseen verities indicated." At the moment at which the existence of other minds becomes certain to me, the feeling of moral obligation is born. Thus we obtain as unimpeachable verity, and guide to action, "I am, I will, I ought." The philoso.phy of consciousness can carry us no further, but rational inference leads us to Religion and Theism. " The Infinite is my Cause ;" and it is agreeable to reason to believe that the sum of forces which antagonises all finite will-force is the manifestation of a self- revealing God. There is besides in the book much polemical matter (of an over-lively sort) directed against Mill, Mr. Spencer &amp;c. Christian Psychology: The Soul and the Body in their correlation and contrast. Being a new translation of Swedenborg's tractate " De commercio Animae et Corporis, &amp;c." With Preface and Illustrative Notes. By T. M. GORMAN, M.A. London: Longmans &amp; Co. 1876. The Preface and Illustrative Notes are to Swedenborg's tractate in the ratio of about ten to one. Quotations from a variety of sources, ancient and modern, occupy a large portion of a bulky volume. The author's design is apparently to show that "the philosopher of Stockholm " has anticipated the chief results of modern science and philosophy. Among recent depreciators of Swedenborg, he singles Qut for special animadversion two names not often found conjoined-Dr. Maudsley and Cardinal Manning. The Sensutalistic Philosophy of the Nineteenth Century, considered by ROBERT L.' DABNEY, D.D., LL.D. Edinburgh: T. and T. Clark. 1876. The following are the chief topics of this book: Review of the Sensualistic Philosophy of the Previous Century; Sensualistic</page><page sequence="3">296 New Books. Ethics of Great Britain; Positivism; Evolution-Theory; Spiri- tuality of the Mind; A-Priori Notions; Refutation of Sensualistic Ethics; Philosophy of the Supernatural. While the author believes that Sensualism in Philosophy leads to Sensualism in life, it is not for that reason he uses the ambiguous term, but as having no better word to denote "that theory, which resolves all the powers of the human spirit into the functions of the five senses and modifications thereof." The author finds in the disregard of the facts of subjective consciousness the key to the aberrations of nine- teenth century philosophers. Theorie generale de la Sensibilite'. Mgmoire contenant les 6le'qnents cd'une solution scientifique des questions f&amp;ne'rales relatives a la ncatutre et aux lois de lca sensationm, a la formatiom et att rdle des organes de sens, d l'actionb de la sensibilitL s'ar le develop1ement physique et intellectuel de l'individu et de l'esp'ce, par J. DELB(EUF, Professeur 'a l'Universite de Lie6ge. Bruxelles: 1876. The first part of this short treatise (pp. 107) discusses the theory of Sensibility; the second, that of Motility. Under the former head the limits of Sensibility are defined, and a parallel instituted between the laws of sensation and certain laws of physics. The speculations on the origin of the senses remind the English reader of Mr. Spencer, although the author's views have been worked out independently, the hypotheses being further illustrated by the imagined origin of fresh senses, as the " magnetic." The transition from sensation to perception is mediated by Mfotility. The sense of effort is the primary experience; but the idea of motion follows hard upon it, as with a mobile organism movement forms the sensible manifestation of the display of its force. The following distinctions are drawn: "Movement is habitual, when one causes it without 7knowing how; instinctive, when one effects it without knowing why; reflex or automatic, when the individual produces it without knowing it." Automatism is the perfect expression of mental existence. " The Ego is for the sentient being that which procures it the same sensation each time its volition is the same." Theorie Scientifique de la Sensibilite. Le Plaisir 6t la Peine. Par LJEON DUMONT. Paris: Germer Bailliere, 1875. In this work (which forms a volume of the International Scien- tific Library), the author seeks to determine more precisely than has yet been done the nature and conditions of pleasure and pain. It consists of two parts, a general analysis and a special synthesis. In the former the author arrives at his general conception of plea- sure and pain, as the accomnpaniments of an increase or a decrease of the ensemble of forces constituting the ego. This view is distin- guished from previous theories; among others from that of Professor Bain, on the ground that when pleasure is made to depend on an increase of the vital fanctions there is really implied an expenditure, that is a loss, of force. In the second part, the author with the help of his principle makes a careful study of the various forms of plea-</page><page sequence="4">New Books. 297 sure and pain, giving special attention to the aesthetic pleasures. His theory of the ludicrous, which he had already expounded in a separate volume, is, perhaps, the most remarkable feature in this synthesis. Le Positivis?ne, par ANDRE POEY. Paris: Germer Bailliere, 1876. This is the first of a series of works intended to popularise Positivism. The author has been an attentive student of the Positive Philosophy since 1855, but did not see his way to accepting the Religion and Polity till 1871. He has made his scientific repu- tation by several publications on meteorology, having prosecuted that science for many years in the United States and Mexico; and now, having obtained sufficient leisure, he is in a position to carry out his long-cheliishecd design of helping the world to a better understanding of the work of Comte. In the present volume, reviewing the labours of Darwin and Haeckel and the psycho- physical researches of Wundt, Fechner and others, he claims for Comte a fore-feeling, when not a fore-sight, of the doctrines of biological evolution and of the quantitative expression of mental facts. Studien iiber cdie V7olksseele, von EDUARPD REICHf. Jena, 1876. The object of this volume is to illuminate the laws of life and mind by a comparison of social statistics derived from the most varied sources, and a careful survey of the physical conditions of well and ill-being. The author's conclusion of the whole matter runs thus: " In the last resort all welfare- depends on the constitu- tion we inherit fronm our forefathers ancd shall transmit to our descendants, and on right conduct during the whole of life. The corner-stone on which the weal of the national soul rests, and on which the temple of all real good of heart and mind must be seated, is the care of physical health (Gesundheitsp9flege)." Das Leben der Seele, von Prof. Dr. Mf. LAZARUS. Zweite, erweiterte und vermehrte Auflage. Bd. I. Berlin, 1876. The first edition of this work was published in 1855. It consists of a series of monographs on important psychological questions. The contents of the present volume are " Culture and Science," " Honour and Glory," " Humour," " On the Relation of the Individual to the Whole." The work is much more than a classifi- cation and description of phenomena; it is an attempt, in language adapted to the understanding of all educated readers, to get at the conditions and general principles of the phases of nmcntal life passed in review by the author. In Psychology, the author sees a science yet in its early youth, but destined one day to fulfil the aspirations of Herbart in having a Static and Dynamic strictly mathematical.

Philosophie als Denken der Welt geiizss dem Princip des kleinsteqn K'raftmasses. Prolegomena zu einer Kritik der reinen Erfa,hrung von Dr. RICHARD AVENARIUS. Leipzig, 1876. The writer of this fresh and highly suggestive little work (80 pp.) sets out with the principle that mental life in its connection with organic life, as a whole, is determined to certain ends (zweckmiissig), and that as a consequence of this its operations are invariably carried out in that particular way (among all possible ways) which involves the least expenditure of energy. The author here applies this conception of mental work solely to intellectual operations, and particularly to the process of " theoretic appercep- tion," by which is understood the interpretation of presentations by a subsumption of the same under pre-existing concepts derived from previous perceptions. This apperception of objects and events by means of general concepts representing what is already known is, he maintains, the performance of a larger amount of work with the same expenditure of energy, and the impulse to bring our presentations under such general concepts (begreifen) illustrates the manner in which our mental life is controlled by the need of husbanding energy to the utmost. Philosophy is regarded by the author as consisting solely in an attempt to grasp the elements of experience under the comprehensive concepts. A necessary concomitant of this process is the purification of expe- rience, that is the determination of the net result of the actually known, after eliminating the suppositions which have their origin in the naive modes of conception of the undisciplined intelligence (anthropomorphic conceptions, &amp;c.). In this way the ideas of substance, force, ca,usality, and necessity will be expelled as met- empirical (to use Mr. Lewes's happy expression). Experience will thus be reduced to two factors, Sensation and Motion, of which the former is to be regarded as the content of all existence, the latter as its form. Optimismus uncd Pessiqrismus. Der Gang der christlichenl Welt- qunzd Lebensansicht, von Dr. W. GAss. Berlin, 1876. The rival theories of Optimism and Pessimism occupy at the present time the minds of Germany to an extent we in England hardly appreciate. In the above-named treatise the theories are compared by a libera,lminded theologian. The writer decides in favour of Optimism, though after no unfair treatment of the opposite system. " Whoever looks upon life only as a cycle becomes Pessimist: he who considers it only as progress, becomes a super- ficial enthusiast or progressionist. The more earnest Optimism has to insert the first view into the second, and must accordingly recog- nise that progress passes through the difficulties of the cycle." W. C. COUPLAND.</page></plain_text>
