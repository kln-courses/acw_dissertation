<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER* BY Nathan Leites To make guesses about contemporary developments in moral temper is risky for various reasons. First, the per tinent data are mostly not yet gathered, as the empirical study of morality has hardly begun. Hence every statement to be made is only a tentative hypothesis. Second, a reason ably complete picture would show a complicated structure of tendencies and counter-tendencies, within and between in dividuals and groups. Almost all broad statements would have to be qualified according to class, character structure, region, age, ideology etc. Third, it is one of the trends to be discussed that contemporary moral changes proceed rather covertly and unobservedly—"not with a bang but with a whimper, " if I may use this familiar quotation. Fourth, in the presence of these difficulties, speculation is apt to be dis torted by the moral preoccupations of the person who en gages in them. He may, for instance, be inclined to exag gerate the occurrence of his own predicaments in others. I shall not burden every guess set forth below with a repetition of these qualifications. What follows refers only to the non-totalitarian part of western culture, and more specifically to the metropolitan areas of North America and Western Europe. This paper deals mainly with directions of current changes. It does not deny that older and well-known patterns persist. As to current changes, I shall deal particularly with disintegration, rather than re-integration. The data mentioned below (particularly the literary and philosophic ones) are illustrative, i.e. not designed to prove my general statements. Philosophic statements are mainly •This paper was written at the beginning of 1947 hence does not make use of Camus' La Peste and other publications which appeared later.</page><page sequence="2">4 NATHAN LEITES viewed in this paper as expressing feelings of those who create and accept them rather than as describing the world. (1) I MORAL UNCERTAINTY In previous periods the feeling of certainty about some moral statements (e.g. those condemning the indefinitely pro tracted torture of others) was probably as "absolute" as the feeling of certainty about immediate sense data (this table is brown) or about logical—mathematical statements (two plus two is four). I am not concerned here with the epistemological relevance, or lack of relevance, of such cer tainty feelings, but only with the feelings themselves. Many people, of course, felt such an absolute certainty only for some of their ethical beliefs and not for others. In addition there were in the course of western history in creasing disagreements about the content of the absolutely certain ethical norms. But a certain core remained un touched. (2) In the second quarter of the twentieth century two long prepared events emerged on a large scale, one by now com mon-place, the other less so. First, the core of moral agree ment tended to vanish as western culture split into a totali tarian and a non-totalitarian part. Second, the degree of felt certainty in moral reactions, of whatever content, tended to decline in the non-totalitarian part. A moral statement began to seem by its very nature incapable of the massive certainty of statements about facts. With this, there was a decline in the feeling that ethical statements could be as conclusively proved as statements about facts. In the older image of a dispute about ethics there were two possible outcomes: either the right side won by the cogency of its arguments, or the wrong side refused to accept the truth, governed by uncontrolled passions. In the newer image of such a dispute both sides become aware</page><page sequence="3">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 5 of the impossibility of proving their points. "Rational" persuasion in moral matters has become less conceivable. The older attitude could be accompanied by the desire to coerce those who refused to be instructed. (Hitler still spoke of 'die Unbelehrbaren'.) The aiewer attitude tends to look for extra-verbal means of resolving a verbal deadlock. Such means may range from silence to violence. The decrease in public discussions of ethical problems is related to this. The philosophic counterparts of these feeling trends can be found in logical empiricism (the rage of the thirties) and existentialism (the rage of the forties). (3) Radical empiricism—so often approached in the history of western philosophy—was never fully formulated before the middle thirties. Take the "Vienna Circle" and its Anglo American sequels. In the twenties this group insisted on the distinction between "meaningful" (logical-mathematical and empirical) statements and "meaningless" (metaphysi cal) ones. It did so with a feeling-tone which took for granted some superiority of science over metaphysics. At the same time this group insisted on the arbitrariness of preference statements. (3%) But, as I just noted, a prefer ence statement in favor of science as against metaphysics was at least suggested in the way in which the distinction between "meaningful" and "meaningless" sentences had been form ulated. This was increasingly recognized in the thirties, and the last preference residue eliminated. "Positivists" re named themselves "logical empiricists". (4) Some proposed to replace the preferential terms "meaningful" and "meaning less" by such terms as "connectible with scientific language" or "unconnectible" with it. (5) I can be a metaphysician and a logical empiricist. Jean-Paul Sartre tells about a young man who saw his past life as a series of failures: " ... He judged . . . this as a sign that he was not destined for secular triumphs, that only religious triumphs . . . were accessible to him . . . and he took orders. Is it not clear that he himself decided the meaning of this sign? One might have inferred . . from this series of failures . . . that he should have become a</page><page sequence="4">6 NATHAN LEITES carpenter or a revolutionary . . (6) In a more general vein: "What proves that it is my task to impose my con ception of man ... on humanity? I shall never find any sign which could convince me. . . If I consider this act as good, it is I who choose to say that it is good rather than bad." (7) The disappearance of ethical certainty may be followed by a fading out of the ethical dimension of feeling. In the past some deviants had denied ethical certainty in a milieu which possessed it. Ethics preoccupied them probably more than it did the conformists. They denied, often with effort (expressed in elation or cynicism, for example) a certainty which remained emotionally conceivable or even plausible to them. The same holds true for anti-religious and anti metaphysical activists of the "heroic period" of struggle against dominant religious and metaphysical beliefs. Now perhaps a new type of "tabula rasa" man is ap pearing for whom earlier "live options" have died. During the last generations there were more and more who, religious ly "color-blind", had lost empathy with religious feeling. In their wake there was an increasing number who had lost the sense of metaphysical experience. And finally now those may be appearing who find it difficult to understand what the pros and cons of ethics are all abont. (7Vo) II CONSEQUENCES OF ATHEISM There is probably a direct relationship between the weak ening of religious and metaphysical beliefs and the decline of ethics. This assertion is both highly familiar and some what new. It has been a stock polemic weapon of conserva tives during the last five hundred years. Its denial has been an only slightly less standard polemic tool of innovators who stressed their ethical respectability. Thus the implicit formula of French anti-clericalism under the Third Republic was: "Nothing changes if God does not exist." (8) If traditional moral attitudes depend on traditional</page><page sequence="5">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 7 attitudes towards religion and metaphysics, the late nine teenth and early twentieth century were living, morally, off their inherited religious-metaphysical capital. There was a lag between the decline of religious-metaphysical certainty and that of ethical certainty. The morally respectable "agnostics" or "atheists" of that time had mostly been raised by religious parents and teachers. The recent catching up of ethics in the general decline of non-empirical certainties leads to a reconsideration of beliefs about the independence of ethics and religion. In part, the various views designated as "existentialism" are attempts at such a reconsideration. References to the exist ence or non-existence of God had become almost impolite in philosophic discussions of the preceding period. (9) Now Sartre states that "existentialism is nothing but an attempt to draw all the consequences from a coherent atheist po sition. . . God does not exist ... all the implications of this must be made explicit . . Existentialists opposite a certain type of secular ethics which would like to eliminate God with a minimum of cost." (10) The elimination of God affects ethical attitudes in at least three ways: as the elimination of the creator of ethical norms; as the elimination of the being who punishes their violation and rewards conformity; and as the elimination of after-life. Beliefs in the second function of God had prob ably decreased earlier and more rapidly than beliefs in the first and third. The contemporary discussion is therefore largely centered on these two. If my immediate certainty about whether I agree with a moral norm declines, I will be more dependent on external grounds for such a certainty—e.g. the belief that the norm has been set up by a God. Similarly, I will depend more on critics of the arts if I feel little immediate certainty about beauty and ugliness. Those who are not sure what they feel about a radio symphony rely on the intermission commentator to tell them how good it is. Generally, as im mediate certainty about values declines, it becomes crucial</page><page sequence="6">8 NATHAN LEITES to know the brand and the endorsers. This is part of the current trend toward externalization. Thus moral norms are threatened from two sides. While immediate certainty about them is declining, beliefs about their maker are also weakening. The result may be com plete uncertainty: ". . . It is very embarrassing that God does not exist, for with Him the possibility disappears of finding values in a Heaven of Ideas . . . Dostoievski wrote: 'If God did not exist, everything would be permissible.' This is a starting point of existentialism." (11) In Sartre's play The Flies, the hero says: "Freedom crashed down on me. There was nothing left in heaven, no Right or Wrong." (12) (13) Similarly, Camus says: "Man-aware-of-absurdity could ac cept only one ethic, namely one which would not be separated from God, one which would be dictated." (14) However, looking at the world, he exclaims: "The earth! in this vast temple deserted by the Gods, all my idols have feet of clay." (15) In describing the hero of Camus' The Stranger, Sartre adds to Dostoievski's point : ' ' Man-aware-of-absurdity expe riences the olivine irresponsibility of one condemned to death. Everything is permitted as God does not exist and as one dies." (16) Presumably the forecast of one's death as annihilation has been steadily gaining in frequency and emotional certain ty during the past decades. This is one of the least observed and most influential events in recent cultural history. It evokes a variety of reactions. (17) I shall deal at this point only with the impact of the disappearance of after-life ethics. Against the horizon of my impending (18) annihilation all ethical alternatives may appear as equivalent since they lead to the same terminal state. Thus the hero of The Stranger, awaiting execution, feels: "Nothing, nothing, had the least importance, and I knew quite well why . . . From the dark horizon of my future a sort of slow, persistent breeze had been blowing towards me, all my life long. . . . And on its way that breeze had leveled out all the ideas that</page><page sequence="7">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 9 people tried to foist on me. . . What difference could . . . (it) make. . . . the way a man decides to live, the fate he chooses, since one and the same fate was bound to 'choose' not only me but thousands of millions of . . . people. . . All alike will be condemned to die one day. . . And what difference could it make if . . he (the prison chaplain instead of the hero—N.L.) were executed since it all came to the same thing in the end." (19) (20) Closely related to this experience of universal equival ence is the feeling of pointlessness of a life rushing towards annihilation—ihcluding the pointlessness of ethics. Sartre describes Camus' feeling of absurdity this way: "Absurdity . . . is . . . the discrepancy . . , between man's surge to wards eternity and the finite character of his existence. ." (21) Camus himself speaks of "the profound inutility (inutilité) of an individual life" (22) "In the deadly light of this destiny (death—N.L.) inutility appears. No ethic and no effort are a priori justifiable in view of the bloody mathematics of our condition." (23) (24) Similarly the hero of Sartre's Le mur, a Spanish an archist awaiting execution feels this: "... I had the im pression that my whole life was before me and I thought: It's a darned lie. It wasn't worth anything as it's finished now. I asked myself how I had been able to go for Avalks, to have fun with girls. If I had known that I was to die like this I wouldn't have moved my little finger." He ob serves the Franco officers who are his jailers: "These two dressed-up fellows with their whips and riding boots were after all human beings who would die. A bit later than I but not much. And they were busy looking for names in their files, running after other people to imprison or liquidate them. They had opinions on the future of Spain and other subjects. Their little doings appeared to me shocking and burlesque—they seemed mad." (25) (26) NOTE: DEATH-ORIENTED ETHICS As long as death was not predominantly felt as an</page><page sequence="8">10 NATHAN LEITES nihilation, it was speakable. It was then often one of the major themes of serious discourse. When in the later nine teenth and twentieth century the belief in death as annihila tion increased, two extreme reactions developed. On the one hand there was the tendency to eliminate death from con sciousness, on the other hand a tendency to be overwhelmed by the awareness of death. The elimination of death from consciousness by repressive and phobic devices has been accomplished with varying degrees of success. (27) It has often been noted that America has gone particularly far in this respect—cf. the U.S. mor ticians' industry or the invulnerability of the Hollywood thriller hero who maintains his body intact through repeated fierce beatings and in the midst of a mounting pile of corpses. It was not only the awareness of death which tended to decline, but also the variety of feelings about it. "The poverty of our thoughts on death amazes me again and again. In other subjects we are rather inclined to complicate matters." (28) (29) A major contemporary alternative to repressive and phobic reactions toward death is concentration on it as "the only reality." (30) I may attempt to transform distress about death into elation. Various contemporary philosophers console their audiences—whether with conscious intent or not—that if there were no death it would have to be invented. Heidegger has often been understood to say that the limitation of time àt my disposal may confer intensity upon every moment. Death sets the pervasive deadline which makes my life dur ing this instant urgent and hence enjoyable. Eternal life may then appear dull. (31) Another defense against death-anxiety is to force one self to face death. One inoculates oneself and one's self esteem is heightened because of the feat one performs. This is a major attitude of Camus. (32) Camus presents man-aware-of-absurdity as the new type of human being who has shed all previously indisdens able illusions. "In Italian museums there are little painted</page><page sequence="9">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 11 screens which the priest held in front of the faces of those about to be executed in order to prevent them from seeing the scaffold. The (metaphysical—N.L.) leap . . . , the sur render to the illusions of everyday life. . . , all these screens conceal absurdity." (33) Death as something else than an nihilation was "the great cry of hope which has been heard in so many centuries and animated so many hearts, except that of the man-aware-of-absurdity." (34) "Death" and "absurdity" tend to become equivalent terms for Camus. In The Brothers Karamasov "it is not the acceptance of Christianity which contradicts the aware ness of absurdity, but the annunciation of an after-life. One can be a Christian and aware of absurdity. There are Chris tians who do not believe in an after-life." (35) Sartre presents his views as implications of the statement that God does not evist. Camus offers his as implications of the statement that death is annihilation "I know a . . . true statement . . . which says that man is mortal Very few have drawn all its consequences." (36) Camus prefers a coimterrepressive and counterphobic reaction to the realization of one's death. He contrasts the nineteenth century "search for oblivion" with his "obstinate testimony to a life without consolation," (37) his aspiration for the "words which would express precisely—in a mood compounded of terror and silence—the conscious certainty of death without any hope." (38) (39) Thus lucidity about death should dominate life. "Man-aware-of-absurdity turns his mind entirely towards death. . . He feels detached from everything except his passionate concern. . . To live a des tiny . . . means to accept it fully. Hence we cannot live our destiny, which we know to be absurd, without doing everything to keep this absurdity constantly in front of us. . . To be alive is to make our absurdity come alive ; that is, first of all, to look at it." (40) The differences between human beings and the changes through time which matter for Camus concern the degree of man's lucid orientation towards his own death. As to secular trends, "the only progress of civilization ... is to</page><page sequence="10">12 NATHAN LEITES create conscious deaths". (41) As to Camus' place of origin, the nature of Algiers ' ' requires an act of lucidity, correspond ing to the act of faith which people make. . . . This people (of Algiers) throws itself entirely into the present. It lives without myths and consolations. It has staked every thing on this earth, hence it is defenceless against death. "(42) As to the typical development of a life, Camus believes in two peaks of death anxiety: "That is youth, that hard-to face encounter with death, that physical fear of the animal which loves the sun. . . At the end of their life human be ings worthy of that name (sic) return to this face to face encounter with death." (43) However, this counterphobic reaction does not suffice for Camus. He adds to it a turning of destructive tendencies against the event to which his distress is attached, namely death. He prefers that the unmitigated contemplation of death be accompanied by a mood of "revolt." Man ought to be replete with ' ' the certainty of a crushing destiny minus the resignation one would expect. . . The point is to die unreconciled. . . The only truth of man-aware-of-absurdity is defiance." (44) This revolt expresses itself in the abuse of death. "The ultimate end ... is despicable." (45) Death is "a horrible and dirty affair. . (46) "The cemeteries covering Europe . . . are hideous. We make beautiful only what we love, and death repels and fatigues us. . . It is a sign of Western courage to have made the places where death is supposedly honored so ugly. . . Death is the supreme abuse." (46 Camus attributes a decisive value to this attitude, and here he may express covertly fantasies of omnipotence-by protest. "This revolt gives life its worth. If extended over the whole length of a life, it restores greatness to this life. . . The spectacle of human pride is incomparable. . . Tenacious revolt against this condition is man's only dignity. . . Any destiny can be overcome by contempt for it." (47) This is achieved by a minimum of overt behavior. Silence is the expression of contempt (and contained panic) towards death which Camus favors. He takes the motto for Noces</page><page sequence="11">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 13 from Stendhal's La duchesse de Palliano-. "The execution er strangled Cardinal Cerafa with a silk cord which broke. It was necessary to begin all over again. The Cardinal looked at the executioner and did not deign to say a word." Camus' revolt against death may be a last residue of a traditional world view which he otherwise renounces. It probably involves, unconsciously, anthropomorphic or even theistic beliefs. It may express accusations against parent figures for putting us into an intolerable position of help lessness. You can do with me as you please, but don't de ceive yourself : I despise your methods and only give in to overwhelming force. Ill CONSEQUENCES OF DETERMINISM A second major change related to the decline of ethics is the growing feeling that human behavior is determined. The nineteenth century produced numerous general determin istic formulae which were popular among the highbrow. But it probably largely maintained on the level of feeling a sense of the "freedom" of human behavior. Philosophic determinism is now less prevalent. However, the sense of freedom is presumably weakening—under the impact, among other things, of anti-individualistic trends in social structure and of contemporary psychology. For the first time we are acquiring some skill in predicting scientifically how a cer tain person is likely to feel and act under certain conditions. Of course knowledge of this kind is still in its beginnings. But its existence—as distinct from mere announcements of a deterministic psychology yet to be constructed—has made it much more convincing that human events may be as "de termined" (or undetermined) as non-human events. To my mind "determinism" in the science of human affairs does not logically preclude "absolute" moral norms. But the psychological impact of the awareness that this or that human act is "determined" has probably been to weaken</page><page sequence="12">14 NATHAN LEITES ethical feelings. One reason for this is, of course, that tra ditional ethics affirmed man's "freedom." Conversely the "natural" events which we are accustomed to treat as "de termined" are also the ones to which we do not apply ethical norms. (48) The same holds true for human artefacts. This fosters the tendency to at least want to react to a misbehav ing person as we spontaneously do to a misbehaving car. At the same time various factors make for an opposite, indeterministic orientation. Predictability in human affairs has increased mainly in the small world of one or a few in tensively studied individuals. On the other hand, large scale events seem much more unpredictable than a generation ago. The discontinuity of the public surface of happenings has become greater. The vast prognostic schemes of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, such as Marx ism, seem less adequate now. Second, my dismay in thinking of my own life as "de termined" may be enhanced if I feel stuck in personal or professional ruts which make me predictable and which are as unsatisfactory as they seem unavoidable. I will then also resent it if any aspect of my life is treated as a "mere" instance subsumed under a general law. This predicament is currently expressed in the violent antideterminism of some "existentialists." According to Sartre the existen tialist who describes a "coward" in a novel "says that this coward is responsible for his cowardice. . . The coward whom we show is guilty of his cowardice ... It is possible for the coward to cease being cowardly." (49) For "there is no human nature" (50)—which presumably means that there are no ascertainable laws of feeling and behavior. Everything is possible' at every moment. Sartre does not indicate how this affirmation is compatible with contemporary psychology. IV PRESERVATION AND RESTITUTION TRENDS I shall now discuss some less extreme aspects of moral disintegration, and defenses against if. These trends con</page><page sequence="13">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 15 cern, first, moral feelings; second, formal characteristics of moral judgments; third, their content. I spoke above of the loss of the sense of moral expe rience. Short of this there may be a decline in moral re vulsion at events which violate my norms, and a decline in moral indignation against those who have committed these violations. (51) (52) This point could be illustrated by a variety of contemporary events. (53) There is probably also a decline.in moral concern about this decline in moral concern: ' ' Our growing insensitiveness has escaped our own attention. ' ' (54) A related trend is this: The violator of an ethical norm tends to feel his act as less alien to his central self. This is shown, among other things, by changes in the style of neuroses. A relevant distinction is that between neurotic symptoms (such as hysterical conversions, compulsions and obsessions, anxiety states and phobias) which the person experiences as intruding föreign bodies; and non-sympto matic neurotic acts (such as expressions of "undesirable" charactertraits) which the person feels to belong to the core of his self. The relative frequency of non-symptomatic neurotic acts, as against symptomatic ones, has been and probably still is increasing. Conversely conscience reactions are increasingly felt as alien to the core of the self. It happens more frequently that I conform to a moral norm not so much because I fully accept it—I may regard it as absurd—but rather because I predict that I will hate myself in the morning if I violate this norm. I may regretfully view such guilt-like discom fort as a fact to be reckoned with—just as I may accept my propensity to develop a certain absurd obsession, and try to know and avoid the conditions under which it occurs. The conscience becomes a symptom. (55) Nineteenth century the ories of human behavior, now obsolete, developed elaborate pleasure-pain calculations. The contemporary behavior pat ern which I just described calls them to mind again. Also, I may act morally in a near-compulsive way: I find myself acting morally without knowing why. Thus the</page><page sequence="14">16 NATHAN LEITES Spanish anarchist who is the hero of Sartre's Le Mur re fuses to purchase his life by telling the whereabouts of a comrade (though the indication which he gives to mislead his jailers turns out to be correct): "... I should have liked to understand the reason for my behavior. I preferred to die rather than to betray Gris. Why ? I didn't love Ramon Gris anymore. My friendship for him had died together with my wish to live. Of course, I still respected him. . . But it was not for that reason that I chose to die in his place. His life wasn't worth more than mine. No life was worth anything. They were going to put a man against the wall and shoot at him until he died. It did not make any difference whether it was Gris or somebody else. I knew that he was more useful to Spain than I, but I didn't care a damn for Spain or anarchism. Nothing mattered anymore. And nevertheless, there I was, I could save my skin by betraying Gris and I refused to do it. I thought that was rather funny. What obstinacy!" In Lettres a un ami allemand, first illegally published during the war, Camus points out that many Frenchmen felt impelled almost automatically to resist the Nazis, but that they also felt the lack of a convincing set of moral norms to support this reaction. Thus the writers discussed here deal with people who behave well, in traditional terms, without feeling too good about it (cf. the instances just mentioned) ; or who behave badly without feeling badly about it (cf. the hero of The Stranger ) ; or who behave badly and feel badly about it (cf. the male figure in Sartre's In Camera). What is lack ing is behaving well and feeling good about it. Another adaptation to the decline of moral certainty is the tendency to set up moral norms not for all men and all times, but—in the extreme case—for myself alone, or even for a unique situation in my unique life. This is a major expression of the trend towards privatization, the counter part of the increasing involvement of the individual in large organizations. It is probably also an attempt to counteract the decline of moral certainty. Traditional moral norms</page><page sequence="15">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 17 were formulated as universal statements, that is as state ments applying to an indefinite number of actions at any time, in any place. (Traditional moral norms had this much in common with scientific laws.) A moral norm which claims validity only for a limited set of familiar persons and events may at present often be able to arouse more conviction. (56) The different variants of "existentialism" are all in favor of non-universal norms. In relation with this there is a tendency to feel that my moral norms are valid only for me, whether they are universal or not. Thus there is an indefinite number of equally valid moral perspectives on the world, each corre sponding to a unique standpoint, i.e. to a certain life situa tion of a certain individual. This view applies to morality an attitude which has long been current in aesthetics (there is no disputing about taste). Here again there is probably an attempt to counteract moral uncertainty. If my choice is either to affirm the absolute validity of my norms as against any others or to deny validity to them altogether, I may feel forced to do the latter. The pluralism which I just mentioned may be an emotionally tenable middle position. Sartre shows in a fashion characteristic for this age the conflict between the traditional attribution of validity to one moral system, and the newer desire for an indefinite number of equally valid moral systems. He starts his argument with the second position : ' ' Every time a man chooses to commit himself in all sincerity and in all lucidity, whatever the pro ject may be, it is impossible to prefer another one to it." (57) But then it suddenly appears that "sincerity" and "lucidi ty" had been implicitly defined in such a fashion that only one "commitment" is compatible with them: that of maxim izing my "freedom" and that of others. However, "free dom" is in its turn so defined that almost any more specific moral system is compatible with it, provided it is antide terministic and felt as created by myself. For in connection with the point just discussed there is the tendency to regard myself as creating my moral norms</page><page sequence="16">18 NATHAN LEITES (and as continually recreating them if I hold them through time), rather than merely discovering them. Sartre insist ently denies the contention of l'esprit serieux that moral norms are "given", "a priori", outside of myself. "There are no signs in the world . . . Neither behind us nor in front of us are there any justifications. . . No a priori value determines my choice. . . Man chooses without basing him self on pre-established values. . . Life has no a priori mean ing. Before you live it, life is a nothing. . (58) Conversely, " it is up to you to give life a meaning . . . namely value . . . There is no other legislator than man himself. " (59 ) This view, too, is in part a defense against the threaten ing collapse of moral feelings. First, it assimilates moral reactions to aestheti c reactions. Aesthetic reactions had seemed less sure than moral ones to previous generations, but may now appear more certain. The earlier emancipation of aesthetics from pre-established rules—formerly felt as a source of aesthetic uncertainty—becomes a model for morals : "Moral choice must be compared with the construction of a work of art. . . Has anybody ever reproached a painter for not having been guided by a priori rules? (sic) Has anybody ever told him which picture to paint? (sic) . . . It is generally understood that aesthetic values are not a priori, but appear after creation has been completed. . . Art and morality have creation and invention in common. We can not decide a priori what to do." (60) Second, this view is designed to maintain morality de spite the disappearance of God. The premise is that "man is forsaken, as he finds nothing within or outside him to cling to. . . We are alone. . . Man is without any support and without any aid." (61) More specifically, there is unfor tunately no God who could create a priori moral norms. "There can be no a priori good as there is no infinite and perfect consciousness to think it. . . There are only human beings." (62) Thus there are only two possibilities: either there are no moral norms, or man creates them. Sartre in his restitution attempt takes the second option as a lesser evil. "One objection to existentialism runs: . . . values are</page><page sequence="17">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 19 not serious as you choose them. To this I answer, I am very sorry that this is so. But if I have eliminated God the Father, I need somebody to invent values. Let us face the facts." (63) The eighteenth century motto "If God did not exist, we would have to invent him," is thus changed into this formula: as God does not exist we have to invent his creations. The plausibility of this attitude is enhanced by man's rising omnipotence feelings in relation to nature and his own body and mind. We take it for granted that we can, now or in some near future make rain, visit the moon, pro duce homunculi in the shape of ever better thinking ma chines, prolong life, "beautify" bodies and "adjust" minds. We receive advances along these lines with a minimum of surprise and elation. It is rather the delay of an advance, as in the case of cancer therapy, which occasions raised eye brows. (64) Another defense against the decline of moral feelings is the tendency to reduce the content of moral norms to a minimum in the hope of reaching a core of certainty. The moral norms which are then put forward appear on closer examination to be almost empty, i.e. compatible with almost any behavior. I mentioned "Sartre's norm of "freedom" as an instance of this. Another instance is Camus' advocacy of the maximization of experience, in connection with his preferences for lucidity about death and revolt against death. "The point is not to live best but to live most. . . On the one hand awareness of absurdity implies that all experiences are equivalent. On the other hand, it asks for the maxim ization of the number of experiences. . . Premature death . . is the only obstacle. . . Thus man-aware-of-absurdity would prefer forty years of consciousness and sixty (sic) years of lucidity to any depth of experience, any emotion, any pas sion, any sacrifice." (65) (66) Camus does not point out in detail how a Total Life Experience Index could be constructed which would enable us to assign a numerical value to any given life, or at least to decide which of any two lives ranks higher than the other.</page><page sequence="18">20 NATHAN LEITES His only suggestion is to give weight to the diversity of experiences. (The relation of this point, as well as of the maximization point itself, to the weakening of moral feelings is clear. It is no more evident that one kind of life is moral ly superior to another. Hence the only affirmation which remains plausible is that the more you get of various kinds of life, the better.) Thus "Don Juan realizes an ethic of quantity." (67) Similarly actors "act man in the diverse ways in which he can exist and does exist," which brings them into conflict with the Catholic Church : ' ' There can be no compromise between 'everywhere' and 'always' (68) Like travelers—another type of life maximizers—actors "exhaust any given experience and ceaselessly search the earth for more." (69) The traveling actor with a girl in every town would thus seem to be the caricatural version of the ideal proposed here. The life maximization norm excludes suicide (70) but little else. It seems compatible with any kind of destructive behavior short of killing. In his gallery of life diversifiers Camus does not include the concentration camp command ant who "unceasingly searches" his imagination and that of his assistants for new nuances of destructiveness. Nor does he include the type of collaborationist who—concurring with Camus' preference for life against death—feels that it is better to be a living slave than a dead free man and who is willing to purchase life at any price of abjectness. It is indeed striking that the types of life maximizers whom Camus does mention are relatively harmless according to traditional moral standards. But, as I have just tried to show, they need not be. Thus Camus' master norm is rather empty of content. It is still, however, a moral norm. In other cases the core of certainty, when finally reached, may not even be moral. It may be simply the factual (71) denial of a pervasive sense of unreality. The "neurotic" doubt about preferences then recedes as the "psychotic" uncertainty about facts be comes dominant. Thus the hero of Camus' The Stranger attains just before his execution a state of exaltation in con</page><page sequence="19">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 21 templating the Facts of Life and Death: "It might look as if my hands were empty. Actually, I was sure of myself, sure about everything, far surer than he (the prison chap lain—N.L.), sure of my present life and the death that was coming. That, no doubt, was all I had: but at least that certainty was something I could get my teeth into—just as it had got its teeth into me. (72) Similarly Heidegger's first "principle . . . is . . . the naked "factness', that is what remains of life when ... its entire traditional content has been eliminated. The term which expresses the notion of factness in Sein und Zeit is 'existence'. This refers not to what a being is . . . but to the very fact that a being is . . . This fundamental point of existentialism makes a supreme problem . . . out of something which appears obvious. This in its turn implies . . . that all the traditional contents of life have lost their substance" (73) Hence the peculiar nature of Heidegger's influence at the University of Freiburg in the Weimar period: "The principal point of his impact on his disciples was not their expectation of a new system, but on the contrary, the indeterminacy of the content of his philosophy and ... his concentration on 'the only thing which is necessary' . . . sheer decidedness, without an in dication of its objectives. One student invented this witti cism : ... I am decided, only I don't know about what." (74) (75) The witticism just quoted recalls that the reaction to an almost empty norm is apt to be ambivalent. One of the factors fostering current disaffection from traditional moral s3rstems is, in fact, the growing awareness that they do not enable us to decide many conflicts which we encounter. Sartre presents at length the predicament of a man confront ed with mutually exclusive obligations towards his mother and his nation. He gives this old story a somewhat new twist by stressing that none of the traditional moral systems has anything to say about what he should do. (76) (77) (78) There is probably a mounting wish for a full rather than an empty set of moral norms. But this wish comes up against the difficulties of producing certainty feelings about specific</page><page sequence="20">22 NATHAN LEITES norms. Thus it is common to almost all variants of "exist entialism" to use words like "substantive", "concrete", "particular," "specific" as positive terms in ethical theory, and "formal", "abstract," "universal," "general" as nega tive ones. But, as I have tried to show, usually existential ists do not declare norms which possess those characteristics they regard as desirable. If the content of norms obstinately remains dubious, there will be an inducement to revive the credo quia absurd um defense against ethical collapse. One stresses the act of accepting a norm rather than the norm itself. This may be done in a number of ways. The act of acceptance may be felt as a moment of ecstasy when barriers against belief sud denly break down. (Cf. Kierkegaard). The lingering feeling that the norm, though accepted, remains unconvinc ing ("absurd") may appear as the indispensable sign of its validity. What is easy to believe can't be right. Another attempt to counteract the threatening collapse of ethical feelings is to insist that every moment counts. In Sartre's In Camera, whose scene is laid in hell (a. drawing room in Second Empire style), a man looks back over his life and tries to avoid believing in his cowardice: "I died too soon ... I wasn't allowed time ... to do my deeds." But another character answers : ' ' One always dies too soon— or too late And yet one's whole life is complete at that mo ment, with a line drawn neatly under it, ready for the sum ming up." (79) This attitude of living morally as if this moment were my last is related to various current trends of feeling. First, the greater awareness of death as annihilation tends to min imize the feeling of distance between this moment and the last moment of my life. Second, it becomes more plausible that violence will cut my life short. When this forecast is not faced directly it may be evaded by "living in the mo ment." (80) Third, beliefs in "Progress" are yet more weak ened and replaced by feelings of the unpredictàbility of ev erything, if not by pessimism. It becomes increasingly diffi</page><page sequence="21">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 23 cult to look at one's life as an ingredient to be thrown into a vast and time-consuming enterprise. It is in this context that we may view Sartre's recom mendation of "action-with-despair". "I must commit my self . . . and act according to the old formula: hope is not necessary for activity ... I shall be without illusions and ... do what I can. For example, when I ask myself whether there will be a general nationalization (of economic activi ties—N.L.), the answer is that I don't know anything about that. I only know that I'll do everything I can to make this happen. Outside of this I can't rely on anything." (81) An attitude of this kind admits of two variants. First, I may act without any regard for the predictability of the outcome or for the success of the collective operation in which I participate. Such an attitude may accompany a pervasive sense of my annihilation through death and of the annihilation of life on earth by virtue of the second law of thermodynamics. Hence Camus' counsel "to create with out considering any tomorrow." A creator ought to be able ' ' to see his work destroyed a day after its completion and be aware of the fact . . . that building for centuries to come isn't any different." Still more, "as I know that no cause is victorious (as everything .dies—N.L.), I like lost causes." (82) Another possibility is this: I may be willing to act in a collective enterprise only if at least some short-run pre dictions can be made and if they are not too unfavorable. (83) In the first case I am willing to act even in utter darkness or hopelessness—or I even regard such conditions as inevitable. In the second case I require at least a flashlight lighting up some of my immediate surroundings and revealing not too unfavorable terrain. The late nineteenth and early twentieth century political activists—e.g. many Marxists—felt that they acted in full daylight and saw wide and agreeable prospects. They re lied on themselves (implicitly) and on the Historical Pro cess (explicitly). Sartre, befitting the temper of the age, withdraws the second support. But befitting the temper of</page><page sequence="22">24 NATHAN LEITES early post-liberation France he substitutes for this loss the reliance on the present activities of my organization: "I Avili rely on my comrades-in-arms to the extent to which they are involved together with me ... in a party or group which I can more or less control, i.e. whose active member I am and whose activities I am always acquainted with. . . . But I can't rely on human beings I don't know. I must limit myself to what I see. I can't be sure that future comrades-in-arms will take up my effort after my death." (84) This view is weakened by the powerful trends which make the individual feel increasingly helpless and in the dark in relation to the organizations he belongs to. (85) I am less apt to feel that "I can more or less control" my organi zations; that "I am always acquainted" with their activities; that I "see" these organizations. It is not only the future which appears invisible. Kafka's castle, existing in the pres ent, is equally invisible. Hence, a tendency towards extreme positions. To state this exaggeratingly : Either I accept participation in collec tive action in utter darkness. Or I privatize myself. That is, I rely only on myself and, at the most, a few others whose reactions I can calculate by familiarity or enforce ; and I only go in for brief undertakings. An instance of this is the predominant hero type of the Hollywood melodrama in the forties. He moves about a strange city at night, aware of unknown enemies, suspecting the motives of those who seem friendly, uncertain whether any move will bring him nearer to his goal or lead to beatings and death. His more delicate counterpart is the student of Sartre who had to choose between making his mother unhappy and remaining passive in the Second World War: "He was aware of the fact ... that his relationship to his mother had an assured effect. He helped her to keep alive. Any attempt to leave (France) and to fight (in the Free French Forces) was an ambiguous act 'which could well get lost in the sands . . . , could well be interrupted before completion." (86) Feelings of this kind currently lead to a revaluation of small scale activities by people who previously felt the need to relate</page><page sequence="23">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 25 themselves as directly as possible to the Historical Process. A preoccupation with the next phase of World Capitalism may give way to concern for this year's building projects of the local school board. (87) I discussed before the attitude of getting a favorable moral score right now. Concentration on this moment may of course also take the hedonistic form of "carpe diem". This is an implication of Camus' life maximization norm which I discussed above. "The present moment and the succession of present moments before a ceaselessly conscious conscious ness—that is the ideal of man-aware-of-absurdity. "I ob stinately refuse any 'later on', as I do not want to renounce the richness of the present moment." Don Juan leads "a life oriented on joys without any tomorrows." (88) (89) The hero of Camus' The Stranger awaiting execution, attempts to get rid of the intruding prison chaplain: "I'd very little time left and I wasn't going to waste it on God." (90) In the final scene of the pre-war French film Port aux brumes the hero lies fatally wounded on the street as his girl friend runs towards him. He indicates impatiently that she should kiss him quickly: he has so little time left to enjoy her kiss. In the post-war French film Jericho hostages in occupied France spend the night in a church awaiting their execution at dawn. The collaborationist among them mounts the pul pit and delivers a sermon : Let us try to purchase life at any price. If we die, a monument in our honor will in due time be unveiled one sunny afternoon on the main square of the town. Who will drink the beer, flirt with the girls, walk in the sun that afternoon! Not we. We will have ceased to be. What will it matter to us? Related to the point that every moment counts morally is the affirmation that only completed overt actions are moral ly relevant, not subjective preparations for them. (91) I mentioned before that in Sartre's In Camera a man in hell tries to avoid believing in his cowardice. He had been a Brazilian (92) pacifist for many years. When war came he attempted to flee the country to evade conscription, was caught and executed after collapsing in front of the firing</page><page sequence="24">26 NATHAN LEITES squad. In hell he asks: "Can one possibly be a coward when one has deliberately courted danger at every turn? And can one judge a life by a single action?" Another character an swers: "Why not? For thirty years you dreamt you were a hero and condoned a thousand petty lapses—because a hero, of course, can do not wrong. . . Then a day came when you were up against it, the red light of real danger,— and you took the train (sic) to Mexico. . It's what one does and nothing else, that shows the stuff one's made of. (Seuls les actes décident de ce qu'on a voulu.") You are—your life, and nothing else." (93) In general terms: "Only action is real. . . Man is . . . nothing but his actions taken together, nothing but his life. There is no artistic genius except that which expresses itself in works of art. . . Outside of this, there is nothing. . . Mere dreams, expectations, hopes make a man a disappointed dream, an abortive hope, a useless expectation. . . Man is but a series of enterprises." (94) This emphasis on the exclusive moral relevance of actual accomplishments is probably in part an attempt to compen sate for the fragility of moral feelings. In addition, recent developments in psychology have made subjective states in creasingly unsuitable for a central place in ethics. First, many attribute a greater "freedom" to overt action than to subjective events. We are often held "responsible" not for our feelings and thoughts but for "acting them out." Sec ond, many tend to infer the seriousness of an intention from the vigor of the action expressing it. The feeling is spreading that any given conscious content may have a number of unconscious meanings. The ensuing action then becomes the only practicable way (short of a psychoanalysis) of de ciding what any such conscious intent "really means." In the nineteenth century and in the early twentieth century much emphasis was put on Gesinnungsethik. There may now be a swing back to Erfolgsethik. A further adaptation to the decline in ethical feelings is the tendency to confine them to an ever smaller area. Spheres which were previously invested with strong ethical feelings are now being more or less divested of them. One</page><page sequence="25">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 27 instance is politics. (95) Presumably the amount of attention to the moral aspect of political events has been declining. (96) This is related not only to the decline in moral certainty, but also to a number of other rising trends of feeling: the feeling that politics, in and between wars, is "too big" to be viewed morally; that the individual is in any case power less in this area which is, in addition, increasingly unintellig ible; that huge violations of traditional moral norms are by now "fixtures" in politics. (97) There are almost no new norms to transform these old-style violations into new-style conformities. For example, political acts increasingly dis regard any moral obstacles in the path of what seems to be maximum efficiency. But the doctrine that the end justifies the means does not spread correspondingly. Similarly, there is a growing tendency to do to the political enemy what he (atrociously, we said at the time) did or planned to do to us. But there is no movement towards an explicit "an eye for an eye" doctrine. Totalitarian practices spread more quickly than totalitarian ideas. This lag fosters the tendency to take morals out of politics. (98) A related trend is to take for granted "jobs" which have somehow become part of one's life routine, i.e. to exempt them from any moral evaluation. (99) The development of the figure of the private detective in mystery stories may be a case in point. Agatha Christie's detective, Hercule Poirot, is repeatedly confronted with the request to stop searching for the murderer. Somebody tries to convince him that the removal of the victim was to everybody's advantage. Poirot. representing the older attitude, habitually answers that he disapproves of murder under whatever circumstances. In contrast to this is the typical reaction of the private detec tive in the 1946 Hollywood movie Nocturne. The heroine appeals to him "as a human being" to stop tracking down the murderer of a man who has caused suffering to everyone he knew. The detective remains blank. He answers that it is his job to.deliver the murderer. Whether the murderer afterwards gets the chair or a public vote of thanks is, he says, no concern of his.</page><page sequence="26">28 NATHAN LEITES Related to the tendency to exempt many events from moral consideration is the tendency to avoid the moral evaluation of an action by viewing it entirely as a means to an end. This is particularly striking when an action is justified by expediency though it could easily be regarded as good in itself. Take the truth value of western propagan da in the two Great Wars. The degree of truthfulness in the "output" of the second War was well above that of the first war. The "Strategy of Truth" became a rule to which more than lip service was paid. But its main justification was by expediency. It became a standard point in the train ing of propagandists to affirm that it does not pay to lie. (100) The Truth with a capital T invoked e.g. in the Dreyfus affair had become just a device. (101) Similar attitudes appeared when in 1945-1946 rations in the western zones of occupied Germany were sometimes raised above a near-starvation level. Official statements (102) repeatedly explained that this was a matter of expediency for the occupants—to avoid epidemics, riots, a "collapse" with its inconvenient consequences for reparations and occupation costs. Moral considerations, whether beneficent or punitive, had become almost unspeakable. (1) "The following pages deal with a feeling of absurdity which one finds here and there in this age. They do not state a philosophy of the absurd" (Albert Camus, Preface to Le mythe de Sisyphe. Paris, 1942. /Translations of passages from this essay are mine./) (2) "... before 1914 . . . when . . . (politicians) were guilty of hypoc ricy . . . , it was the same God whose name they took in vain." (T. S. Eliot: Preface to The Dark Side of the Moon... London, 1946.) (3) Precursors of "existentialism", such as certain variants of German "phenomenology" in the twenties, had shown the increasing precarious ness of ethical feelings by an extreme denial of that precariousness. They put unusual stress on the assertion that the goodness or badness of an event is a property of this event comparable in its "objectivity" to, for instance, sensory qualities of things. (3%) It is, again, significant that the full statement of the logical "no bridge" relation between statements of fact and of preference was delayed until this century. We are now for the first time mastering the skill of</page><page sequence="27">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 29 "... parting All that we feel from all that we perceive, Desire from Data" (W. H. Auden) (4) This was also related to other changes not pertinent to the present point. (5) Cf. Richard von Mises: Kleines Lehrbuch des Positivismus. The Hague, 1939. (6) bartre: L Existentialisme est un humanisme. Fans, ly4b, pp. 4ö-4U. /Translations of passages from this essay are mine./ (7) Op. cit., pp. 30-31. (7%) The decline of the conscious conscience is of course accompanied by a rise in the role of social anxiety. Various intermediate forms short of a complete carrot-and-stick orientation become prominent. In one such form I may still feel that my moral standards are my own, but also that I myself am unable to judge my performance in relation to these standards. (8) Sartre, op. cit., p. 35. (9) During the last generations more and more people felt that the exist ence of a God was implausible if ®ot impossible. But elaborate atheist ideologies became a rarity (the very word "atheism" is now dated). I shall point to an inverse relationship between the diffusion of a feeling and of its symbolic elaboration at other places in this paper. In these cases a minority position fosters, and a majority position renders obsolete the expression of feeling by idea. The ideological muteness of contemporary atheism is also related to th fact that it is largely a depressed abandonment of the wish to believe. "The existentialist . . . thinks ... it is very embarrassing that God does not exist . . . Man is condemned to be free." (Sartre, op, cit. pp. 33-37.) When the hero-narrator of Camus' Hie Stranger (translated by Stuart Gilbert, New York 1946) is asked by the magistrate examin ing him whether he believes in God, he says: "No." "When I said 'no', he plumped down into his chair indignantly. . . 'Do you wish', he asked indignantly, 'my life to have no meaning?' Really, I could not see how my wishes came into it, and I told him as much." (pp. 85-86) In a more general vein: "To look for what is true is not to look for what is desirable. If it were necessary to accept illusions in order to avoid (Kierkegaard's—N.L.) question 'What would life be (if the void were hiding beneath things—N.L.)', . . . the man-aware-of-absurdity prefers . . . Kierkegaard's answer: 'Despair' " (Camus, Le mythe de Sisyphe, p. 61). For Camus, in the middle twentieth century has become unable to accept Dostoievski's fallacy: "If belief in immortality is so necessary to man (as a defense against tendencies towards suicide—N.L.) . . . , then human immortality doubtlessly exists." (Quoted op. cit. p. 149) The depressed feeling-tone of Camus' reluctant atheism is also expressed</page><page sequence="28">30 NATHAN LEITES in his identification with Ivan Karamasov: " 'Everyting is permitted', exclaims Ivan Karamasov. . . . This is not a cry of joyous deliverance, it is a pained statement. A God who would make life meaningful is much more attractive than the impunity of wrongdoing. The choice would not be difficult. But there is no choice. Here bitterness begins" (op. cit. p. 94). Atheism is "the lucid protest of man thrown into a world whose light and splendor incessantly suggest a God who does not exist." (Camus, /Noces, Paris, 1939, p. 96.,/Translations of passages from this essay are mine./ In earlier periods atheism had often proudly disposed of God as not only impossible but undesirable. The depressive feeling-tone of contemporary atheism is in its turn reenforced by its muteness. It lacks the relief which may come with the verbalization of a distressing feeling, particularly if the words dramatize the predicament of the sufferer. Nineteenth century atheism, insofar as it was depressed, often had these compensations. (Cf. James Thomson's City of Dreadful Night) (10) Sartre op. cit. pp. 94, 33, 34. (11) Sartre, op. cit., pp. 33/6. (12) Sartre, The Flies, translated by Stuart Gilbert. London, 1946, p. 96. (13) If I still believe in the existence of extra-natural creators of norms, my doubts may be displaced to my relation with them. Sartre takes up Kierkegaard's discussion of "Abraham's anxiety": When an angel orders the patriarch to sacrifice his son, how can he be sure that it really was an angel, that the message was intended for him, that it really said what he thought it said? (Cf. Sartre, L'Existentialisme est un humanisme, pp. 29-31 (14) Camus, Le mythe de Sisyphe, p. 94. (15) Camus, Noces, p. 123. (The final sentence of the essay). (16) Sartre, Explication de l'Etranger. Paris, 1946, p. 10. /Translations of passages from this essay are mine./' (17) Cf. the note to this Chapter. (18) Sartre describes the attitude of the hero of The Stranger in this way: "As we die there is no tomorrow." (op. cit., p. 9) Camus himself says: "There is no tomorrow." (In Le mythe de Sisyphe, p. 82.) (19) Camus, The Stranger, p. 152. (20) This twentieth century indifferentem is not nineteenth century satanism: "Awareness of absurdity . . . does not recommend crime, that would be childish ... If all experiences are indifferent, conforming to one's duty is as legitimate as anything else. One can be virtuous by caprice." (Camus: Le mythe de Sisyphe, p. 94.)

(24) The life of others appears particularly pointless as the impact of death is reenforced by lack of empathy. Camus observes from the</page><page sequence="29">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 31 outside an Algiers dance hall: "When one sits at a distance from the windows, one perceives .. the faces of the dancers filing by as Chin ese shadows . . . The dark profiles revolve . . obstinately like the cut out silhouettes which one attaches to a phonograph record." (Noces, p. 66) Thus "human beings secrete . . . inhumanness. In certain lucid moments one perceives how their mechanical gestures, their meaningless pantomimes render their entire surroundings silly. A man is phoning behind a glass door. I don't hear him. I see the incomprehensible faces he makes. I am asking myself why he should be alive." (Le mythe de Sisyphe, p. 29.) (25) Sartre, Le Mur, Paris, 1939, pp. 25, 31. /Translations of passages from this short story are mine./ (26) In this context belongs Sartre's intense aversion against those who "try to show that their existence is necessary whereas it is actually utterly contingent. . ." He calls them les salauds. (L'existentialism est un humanisme, pp. 84, 85), less impolitely the adherents of l'esprit serieux. (27) One can never be adequately amazed about the fact that everybody lives as if nobody 'knew' " (Camus, Le mythe de Sisyphe, p. 30.) (28) Camus, Noces, p. 44. (29) George Orwell recently discussed a macaronic elegy of Skelton on somebody's death: Sepultus est among the weeds God forgive him his misdeeds With hey ho, rumbelo Rumpopulorum Per omnia saecula Saecula saecullorum. Orwell comments: "Today there is literally no one who could write of death in that lighthearted manner. Since the decay of the belief in personal immortality, death has never seemed funny. . . Hence the disappearance of the facetious epitaph, once a common feature of country churchyards. I should be astonished to see a comic epitaph dated later than 1850."

The important thing, said Abbe Galiani to Mme d'Epinay, is not to get well, but to be able to live with one's pains. Kierkegaard wants to get well."

But the prevail ing feeling-tone was still that there was an abyss between them. This was probably so not only in the rear-guard actions in which the essen tial identity between man and animal was anxiously denied, but also in the avant-garde actions in which it was, with a now dated elation, affirmed. In the middle twentieth century formal discussions on these points are rare. The previous avant-garde view has become common place not only intellectually but also emotionally. One of the themes of current literature is the transformation of a man into a disgusting animal. In Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis a man awakens one morning as a large bug. Similar themes have been used by David Garnett, Maurice Sandoz, Sartre, and others. It is emotionally no longer en tirely self-evident why stockyards and extermination camps should be utterly incomparable. (49) Sartre, L'existentialisme est un humanisme, pp. 59-62. These passages refer presumably to characters in various recent works of Sartre, such as Garcin in In Camera and Mathieu in The Age of Reason. (50) Op. cit. p. 52. (51) Revulsion at immoral acts and indignation against immoral persons are psychologically related. But their intellectual contents are rather divergent. Moral indignation against wrong-doers attributes to them a "freedom" of choice which science disputes. Moral revulsion at wrong acts does not carry such an implication. (52) In many cases even the person or group that has suffered at the</page><page sequence="31">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 33 hands of others is incapable of reacting with much moral feeling. (53) Cf.

London 1946, p. 27. Ironically our capacity to feel indignation about overt and large scale destructiveness has decreased at a time when our sensitivity to covert destructive tendencies in the small world of personal relations has increased. (55) This is fostered by the tendency of "virtue" to decline more rapidly in emotional convincingness than "vice". An increasing number of persons can achieve little more than absence of conscious guilt. Regard ing oneself eis "good", or being thus regarded, may become slightly shameful.

This earlier forecast is too massively contradicted by the various hells on earth of the middle twentieth century—Auschwitz, Hiroshima, and places in between. Our optimism about our skills tends to become unlimited. So does our pessimism about the ways in which these skills will be utilized by them,—those in control in relation to whom everybody else feels in creasingly impotent. (65) Camus, Le mythe de Sisyphe, pp. 84-88. (66) In the face of death man-aware-of-absurdity acts according to Nietzsche's point that it is not eternal life which matters but eternal liveliness (quoted op. cit. p. 113.). He tries to snatch a few experiences in the face of death: "Awareness of absurdity is, at the end of the last thought of the man about to be executed that shoe-string . . . which he sees at a distance of a few feet on the edge of his dizzy fall . . . " (op. cit., pp. 77-78) (67) Op. cit. pp. 100-101. (68) Op. cit., pp. 109, 113. (69) Op. cit., p. 109. (70) The initial question of Le mythe de Sisyphe is: Do I have to kill myself right now if I know that I will be annihilated sooner or later?</page><page sequence="32">34 NATHAN LEITES It is this context which gives a contemporary slant to Camus' nineteenth century revolt against the traditional values of the French church and bourgeoisie. He thus presents a combination of older and very new ideas which is characteristic of much in France today. (71) Camus believes mistakenly that his preference statement in favor of "living most" as against "living best" is a fact statement. (People who were highly certain about their preference statements in the past were often under the illusion that they were fact statements. Usually peo ple were not aware of, or not interested in, the distinction between these two classes of statements.) Thus Camus says: "I don't have to ask myself whether it is vulgar or disgusting, elegant or regrettable to want, to live most rather than best. Once and for all value judg ments are eliminated in favor of fact statements. . . Where lucidity rules a hierarchy of values becomes unnecessary." (Camus, Le mythe de Sisyphe, pp. 84-87) (72) Camus, The Stranger, p. 151. (73) Karl Loewith, "Les implications politiques de la philosophie d'exist ence chez Heidegger." Les Temps Modernes, vol. 2 no. 14 (Paris, No vembre 1946). (74) Karl Loewith, loc. cit., p. 347. (75) Some awareness of the relative emptiness of the moral systems here discussed expresses itself in the frequent use of "bareness" and "naked ness" terms. According to Hermann Rauschning SS intellectuals in the thirties were impressed by an apocryphal remark of Marshall Tukhatshevski: The world must become naked again. (76) Cf. Sartre, L'existentialisme est un humanisme, pp. 77-78, 85-86. (77) Sartre argues incorrectly in an all-or-none fashion. He affirms that it is not feasible to construct a set of general norms which would decide every case which will come up—a point known from Anglo American jurisprudence and the Freirechtschule. He infers from this that a set of general norms can decide nothing. This he wants to prove for the purpose of his contention that man can not avoid creating his own norms. (78) Sartre probably expresses here a frequent contemporary attitude. Reading Kant today one is apt to feel that certain specific norms (e.g. in favor of keeping promises) are not derivable from the categorical imperative. Kant argued that a society in which immoral behavior, in traditional terms, is universal, would provoke panic in everyone and expose everyone to heavy losses. We have in the meantime become increasingly inured to a dog-eat-dog situation. Many trust their skill in inventing techniques of survival. Some are confident they will be top dogs. (79) Sartre, In Camera translated by Stuart Gilbert, London 1946 p. 163. (80) At present the personal planning of most people does not include the probability that the rest of our lives will be influenced—quite short</page><page sequence="33">Trends in moral temper 35 of war—by a state of Permanent Atomic (and Virus, etc) Alert. Pre sumably the minority that faces this fairly realistic forecast contains a high percentage of people with rather severe neurotic trends. Most people would, of course, find it difficult to take account of this forecast in their behavior even if they kept it in mind. The probability of future acute international crises is of course now widely taken for granted intellectually, but the conscious emotional reactions to this forecast are rather low. In contrast, in the thirties, war appeared intellectually more avoidable, but the forecast of its imminent pos sibility evoked more intense emotional reactions. Cf. A. J. Toynbee's overemphatic description of an atmosphere in the autumn of 1937: "We live in daily dread of catastrophe. . . It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that the shadow of this fear (of war—N.L.) that now lies athwart our future is hypnotizing (sic) us into a spiritual paralysis that is beginning to affect us even in the trivial avocations of our daily life." (A. J. Toynbee, A Study of History, vol. VI, p. 314, Oxford 1939.) Similarly, Decline-of-the-West theories are probably less in vogue in the forties than they were in the twenties, though so much of intervening history can be taken as a confirmation of such views. To the extent to which they are in vogue, they may take a milder form: Spengler did not give us a chance, Toynbee does—although on extra empirical grounds. A similar point can be made for the development of Brave New World forecasts. Blueprints for totalitarian transformations are now issued in limited editions or as "classified" documents by practic ing administrators, rather than as semi-bestsellers by unconventional novelists. Similarly predictions of total destruction are now expressed in bare and unemotional abstractions by physicists rather than in dram atic visions by novelists. Cf. as an example of the new style Edward Teller, "How dangerous are atomic weapons?", Bulletin of the Aionrc Scientists, Chicago, vol. 3, No. 2, pp. 35-36, February 1947.

(op. cit. p. 108) Contemporary methods of</page><page sequence="34">36 NATHAN LEITES permanent auditory and visual recording have not entered the world image of this French writer who is in such close rapport with the Zeitgeist in non-technological respects. (90) Camus, The Stranger, p. 150. (91) If I undergo extreme risks on behalf of preferences which I hold with less than a feeling of total certainty, I may react in two ways. I may endure this discrepancy, perhaps with a feeling of pride about this novel achievement of man. Or I may confer upon my uncertain values a certainty "proportionate" to the risks involved. That is, I may feel: if I am risking so much for these preferences, they must be absolutes for me, though I did not recognize that before. (92) This play was written and produced under the Nazi occupation. (93) Sartre, In Camera, p. 153. (94) Sartre, L'existentialisme est un humanisme, pp. 55, 58. (95) Cf. Ernst Kris and Nathan Leites, loc. cit. (96) One mechanism is for us (any political group) to exaggerate the extent to which the sufferings of others are the "natural" consequences of past events rather than the results of acts of our own which we ex perienced as free when we committed them. Western "public opinion" did not argue that it was morally just to inflict such and such suf ferings on Germans through the Potsdam agreement. It minimized the impact of the agreement and presented German distress mostly as an inevitable consequence of the Second World War. Similarly some pro gressive educators disguise punishments of their pupils as "functional" consequences of the pupils' misconduct. (You had better stay in from the playground so you can finish the work you didn't do during the work period.) (97) During the 20th century there has been a steady rise in the level of political immorality, in traditional terms, which has been taken for granted. How puny the moral enormities of the first World War appear today! (98) Another expression of this tendency is the decrease in the intensity with which political ideologies are held. A comparison of the ideologi cal atmospheres in and around the two world wars could illustrate this point. The official ideological documents of the western powers in the first war roused more feeling, held attention longer, and were to a higher extent viewed as yardsticks for behavior than twenty-five years later. (99) This is not the same as the desired totalitarian pattern in which I morally approve all jobs assigned to me through proper channels. (100) What the arguments were in detail and to what extent they were factually correct is not relevant to my present argument. (101) A related trend is the decrease in public reverence for Scientific Truth (as distinct from the appreciation of the usefulness of scientific truths). "Galileo abjured most easily the important scientific truth he had</page><page sequence="35">TRENDS IN MORAL TEMPER 37 found as soon as it endangered his life. In a certain sense he was right. This truth wasn't worth the stake. Whether the earth turns around the sun or whether it's the other way around, is profoundly indifferent." (Camus, Le mythe de Sisyphe, pp. 15-16) In the past a downward swing in the significance attached to Empirical Truth was apt to be accompanied by an upward swing in the status of Super-empirical Truth. Now they are both declining. "For Chestov reason is vain but there is something beyond reason. For man-aware-of-absurdity reason is vain and there is nothing beyond reason." (op. cit., 55.) (102) Cf. Gollancz, loc. cit. pp. 22-27.</page></plain_text>
