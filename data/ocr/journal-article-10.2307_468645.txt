<plain_text><page sequence="1">Conventions in the History of Art David Summers W HEN I was first asked to write this essay, I declined: I had no sooner done so, however, than I began to notice that the word convention appeared much more frequently than I had realized in art historical writing and that it is in fact a notion that raises questions that seem to me to be of central importance, at the same time that they have been little examined. And so I changed my mind. As I considered these questions my essay has crept in various direc- tions, and it may seem both too thorough and not nearly thorough enough. But it may at least provide a suitable point for the beginning of discussion. "Convention" is a metaphor used for the characterization of cul- tural traits, the use and significance of which are as if agreed upon and the effective origins of which are only to be found in the culture itself.' When we describe Egyptian art as conventional, we mean that it shows no change, no evolution or originality from one work to the next; but in terms of the metaphor we mean that it is as if Egyptian artists had agreed among themselves to use their odd forms of depic- tion and that, moreover, it was necessary for them to have done so because they did not look to nature. Although this is not the place to trace its origins, the idea of convention seems to have arisen together with such ideas as "contract." There is perhaps some justification in the history of institutions for David Hume's definition of convention as "a general sense of common interest; which sense all the members of the society express to one another, and which induces them to regulate their conduct by certain rules."2 But in such matters as art and language, the idea of convention is much more clearly metaphorical. In fact we do not agree among ourselves that Poussin's trees are more "real" than Picasso's,3 nor have we agreed to call a horse a horse rather than an equus or un cavallo or anything else; rather we find that if we are among English speakers, we behave as if such a covenant existed. This is done, in Hume's words again, "with- out the interposition of a promise . . . the actions of each of us have a reference to those of the other, and are performed upon the supposi- tion that something is to be performed on the other part." 0028-6087/81/130103-23$ 1.00/0 Copyright0 1981 by New Literary History, The University of Virginia</page><page sequence="2">NEW LITERARY HISTORY The idea of convention is consequently social and also historical, and in both of these respects it is opposed to the idea of nature, in relation to which conventions are arbitrary.4 For this reason the idea of convention collides with the old standards of naturalism, which, although supposedly banished from the enlightened discussion of art once and for all, have perhaps only burrowed deeper out of sight in the conviction that society and history are not coprinciples with na- ture. For this reason convention has failed to become a neutral term in writing about art.5 Since antiquity, art-and especially painting-has been allied with what is shared but not conventional, that is, with nature. It was assumed-and the idea has by no means been entirely given up-that painting is able to imitate nature with a fidelity unique among the arts: whereas the imitation of poetry was obviously mediated by lan- guage, a painting was immediate, and its formulae and techniques were perfectly transparent to the degree that this immediacy was achieved. Although a landscape is as conventional as a sonnet or a symphony, it is difficult simply to compare this landscape to other landscapes we have seen; rather we compare it to the nature to which it refers and react to it as we might react to nature if it were as it is painted. Even when landscape departs from nature, we are not in- clined to look for the cause of this departure in the previous history of the genre of landscape painting or the medium of oil painting; in- stead, we assume that the painter's "conception of reality" has changed, and we strain to "see" what he sees and to understand it. When painting was concerned with illusion, or with the composition of illusion, its means were treated as if they were transparent, even if they were fairly "painterly." When the means were not transparent, when it began to be felt that paintings were two-dimensional surfaces with colored marks placed upon them, the criticism of painting turned away from visible nature as an absolute to other equally abso- lute alternatives. When objective nature began to vanish behind the examination of knowledge, the criticism of painting veered toward absolutes in the constituting subject. "Feeling" is perhaps the simplest of these, but various psychological theories have also provided the kind of foundation for painting once provided by nature. Even such ideas as the literal, the minimal, and the conceptual, although op- posed to the "natural" in a traditional sense, retain that concern with the absolute that nature once provided. Convention provides no such basis for painting. If modern art historical attitudes are still determined by a more or less conscious naturalism, so that there is a strong reluctance to ground the visual arts in their own traditions, the idea of convention 104</page><page sequence="3">CONVENTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF ART also runs afoul of our more or less conscious idea of the artist and "creativity," both of which are surrounded by values of mythic depth. In much art historical discussion convention has a decidedly negative connotation. Art history developed at least in parallel to Romanticism, and many attitudes toward convention are decidedly Romantic. The artist who "relies on conventions" is by definition not original; and not only is originality regarded as a prime virtue, it is regarded by some authors as the basis of aesthetic values.6 More generally, the history of art is written as the history of innovations. It might even be argued that non-Western art is allowed in our textbooks only because it seems novel in comparison to Western art, just as early modern artists were original as much in turning to such different art as models as in the formal inventions to which these models gave rise. Non-Western ar- tists became highly innovative artists in the history of Western art. It is of course obvious that such inclusion has nothing to do with the real history of non-Western art traditions. At perhaps a more fundamental level, convention is also opposed to expression. An artist who relies on conventions obviously is not ex- pressing himself, unless, viewing the matter physiognomically, he is a conventional person, in which case he is of no interest, or perhaps only of "historical" interest. Convention is identified with the group, with "them," who are the natural enemy of the "I." Such familiar ideas are repeated because they are deep assumptions underlying much art historical writing and indeed justifying the great importance given to art and its study. The idea of convention as I wish to discuss it has important im- plications for the idea of style, and it will be necessary to raise that difficult question in a somewhat foreshortened form in order to proceed. The word style, as is well known, comes from the Latin stilus, a writing instrument.7 The crucial transformation for the subsequent development of the descendant idea is metonymic. A writer may be referred to by his instrument, and the stilus of an author might be used not only to refer to what he writes but also to its evident charac- ter, as we speak of the "hand" of a painter, referring at once to form and quality of form, if the two are in fact ever separable. The metonymy became a metaphor, so that it was possible to speak of the stilus of any artist much as we may speak of any artist as the author of his work, whether or not he is a writer. This relation also reversed itself with significant results, so that the metonymy transformed the whole of which it had been a part: the character of the author came to be identified with the character of his work, or stilus. Thus Quintilian 105</page><page sequence="4">NEW LITERARY HISTORY refers to styles as tardus, neglegens, rudis, confusus, fidelis, all of which might be character traits of individuals.8 Such characteristics of works of art or of styles, although they may in some cases coincide with the character traits of the person who made them, clearly in other cases do not. Still, it is difficult to imagine that Perugino was not a man of sweet piety, or Michelangelo not a man of Herculean physical proportions, however much historical evi- dence there may be to the contrary. At the more sophisticated level of art historical formal analysis, the physiognomic reading of such ex- pressional qualities (as Heinrich Wolfflin called them, referring to the "gravity" of Ruysdael, the "charm" of Hobbema, the "vigorous, pas- sionate" forms of Rubens)9 has been an essential part of art historical methods from connoisseurship to the loftiest flights of cultural his- torical speculation. Forms do have expressive character, and it would be foolish to deny the usefulness of distinguishing among them both on the basis of morphology and of evident expressive differences. But according to Vasari, Perugino was a man of very little religion,?1 and Michelangelo was an ugly man of disappointingly small stature, and it is question- able whether we are ever really justified in considering works of art to be windows through which the nature of the artist is visible as, ac- cording to the ancient science of physiognomy, the nature of a per- son's soul is evident in his outward features. The advisability of such inference becomes even more prob- lematical at a second stage of analysis. When we identify works of art as belonging not to individual artists but to regions or nations or periods, are we entitled to interpret physiognomically the formal characteristics that allow us to do so? Are we justified in talking (as we always do) about "the Minoan feeling for the dynamics of living na- ture"? Or must we worry about a crisis in the Minoan spirit when symmetry appears in their vase painting, signaling a "devolution from naturalism to formalism and abstraction"?" Ever since its earliest metaphorical foundations were laid, the con- cept of style has never strayed from its autographic and physiognomic connotations. It might be more accurately said that the inwardness to the character of which the expressive character of art objects is thought to provide access has simply expanded from that of indi- viduals to those of nations, races, and ages. In this concentric generalization, based on ever broader generalizations to be made about the expressive character of the forms of objects, the original metaphor has never been forgotten. Art historians still speak as if nations, races, and ages-quite apart from considerations of theme or function-mark their artifacts in recognizably unique ways, and as if 106</page><page sequence="5">CONVENTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF ART these recognizably unique marks were signs indicating their collective characters, or souls, or spirits, or wills. To be baroque was to be exuberant, just as to be Minoan was to have "a feeling for the dynamics of living nature." In a certain sense the history of individual artistic characters is the most immediate history of art, since it is centered in the quality of objects (which artistic biography is not; insofar as they have biog- raphies, artists are like everyone else). But I have tried to raise the question of whether or not it is historically useful to consider artistic character at a suprapersonal level. I wish also to ask whether such inferences answer the questions we would like to answer, or whether they should even be expected to answer them. In order to seriate them, it is necessary to assume that differences in sufficiently similar objects (say paintings clearly by the same person) are due to the fact that the objects were made at different times. If there were a large number of such objects, they might be placed in a series proceeding by degrees from-for example-the formally sim- pler to the formally more complex. Such a series would constitute a "development" from simple to complex, or from complex to simple. In the absence of any external evidence, it would require the defini- tion and imposition of some "law of formal development" in order to decide which way the series was to run. As is well known, the most common model for art historical devel- opment is biological, as the metaphor of development itself implies. Developments may be simply incremental but are usually divided into stages-some variation on early, middle, and late more or less corre- sponding to the ages of man. And just as the physiognomic charac- teristics of individual styles are similar to those of places and periods, so the stages of an individual artist's development are generally simi- lar to the progress of period style. Thus anthropomorphism, or, more precisely, physiognomic anthropomorphism, stands at the meta- phorical base of the idea of style in both its synchronic and diachronic dimensions and perhaps gives it much of its apparent cogency. I have lingered over the metaphorical base of style because I believe that such examination makes it more understandable why certain difficulties arise in its application to historical problems. Style is radically-and properly-object and expression oriented, and at the same time it seems to promise generalizations of almost any degree of inclusiveness. But the kind of inference from the formal character of objects and groups of objects to cultural and social generalization is at least highly questionable and is fraught with difficulties in practice. The solution to this problem is not to reject the concept of style, which 107</page><page sequence="6">NEW LITERARY HISTORY has amply proved its usefulness in subtle taxonomic methods, crit- icism, and art history. And, at the highest level of formal generaliza- tion, such sublime historical visions as Riegl's account of the transfor- mation of classical art cannot simply be ignored, nor should such speculation be abandoned. But both the definition of the expressive character of Masaccio's painting and the description of the develop- ment of Riegl's optic plane have this in common: they are pure art history and do not point beyond themselves. They are concerned with forms and their qualities, with continuities among forms and their qualities, and with interrelations among these forms, qualities, and continuities ("influences").12 In his essay on style, Meyer Schapiro observed that theories of formal development have had little impact upon actual art historical investigation because the principles according to which great con- tinuities are explained-say the development from linear to painterly-are different from the principles according to which dis- continuities are explained. The first are accounted for by laws pecu- liar to form itself; the second are accounted for by reference to "psychological or social factors." Thus although it may be argued that the Renaissance style developed inevitably from linear to painterly, we explain the beginning of Renaissance art by marshaling all kinds of historical evidence and by recounting the lives of the most excellent artists from Giotto onwards. It is, Schapiro observes, as if mechanics had two different sets of laws.13 This quandary may arise for the simple reason that in its diachronic dimension the theory of style is based on the assumption of con- tinuity. The theory of style provides ways of placing events in se- quence, and for describing and classifying kinds of sequence; but it cannot explain why sequences abruptly end, or, more puzzling still, why they begin. "Why," Wolfflin asks at the end of his Principles, "does the development ever rebound?" Why, he means, did a new linear style rise in opposition to the painterly mode of the eighteenth century, which had developed serenely from that of the seventeenth? It is, he says, something "unnatural," attributable to "profound changes in the spiritual world.... the main impetus lies certainly in outward circumstances. ... It is the epoch of a revaluation of being in all spheres."'4 Since Wolfflin felt free to read general formal categories as symptoms of spiritual states, he minimized the problem by making it seem as if forms expressing a spiritual state had simply responded to a sudden swerve in the history of the spirit. But the abrupt change is still "unnatural," by which he means that it defies any definition as development and also defies the more general principle of continuity underlying the idea of development. Radical stylistic 108</page><page sequence="7">CONVENTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF ART change thus becomes a mystery and, more specifically, a paradox. But it may well be a paradox that arises from a way of thinking about the subject, not from the subject itself. Like style, convention implies continuity. At its purest-a good example is Egyptian art-convention is a perfect conservative princi- ple, implying sequences of identical objects. But conventions are also related to customs, manners, mores; they are historical in a much less abstract sense than styles, and if they may resist change, they are also subject to change. It is consequently much easier to explain how a new convention comes into existence and becomes current than it is to explain how a new formal configuration comes into existence and becomes current. Let us consider the following example. When Wolfflin wrote his Classic Art, he observed quite correctly that the Italian High Renais- sance style was a style of stated and resolved contrasts.15 He described these contrasts and their effects splendidly, but could not explain (and did not try to explain) how such a style came to be formulated. But such composition did not simply crystallize as the expression of a new aesthetic ideal; it instead arose as the fulfillment of identifiable goals, aspirations, and efforts rooted in both contemporary and traditional values. As Michael Baxandall has argued, pictorial composition is itself a convention.16 Such a statement flies in the face of our use of the term composition, which is virtually synonymous with "work of art." But this usage simply means that the convention of composition is a deep convention in which we are still involved. The idea of systematically addressing the problem of giving works of art-especially paintings-a certain kind of aesthetically derived visual unity, pleas- ing in itself over and above subject matter, was a Renaissance idea, and especially the idea of Leon Battista Alberti, who developed his formulae for pictorial composition in analogy to classical ideas of literary composition, and especially of rhetorical composition. In the tradition of classical rhetoric, one of the oldest conventions of com- position was antithesis, the setting together of opposites, which had a kind of acanthus-like life through the Middle Ages. Alberti recom- mended that this device be incorporated in painting, and Leonardo concentrated his advice into precisely those pictorial inventions- chiaroscuro, figural contrapposti-that Wolfflin saw as the elements of the style and which were in fact essential to it and to its influence. To say that chiaroscuro composition was a convention is not to say that it is a dead counter in the art historical process. On the contrary, it com- mands a certain region of significance, and this significance is the basis for countless inflections, versions, and transformations through the nineteenth century.17 109</page><page sequence="8">NEW LITERARY HISTORY Rather than thinking of chiaroscuro composition as a purely formal solution, arising from new aesthetic ideals, that by dint of its inherent superiority and suitability to the age in which it emerged "influenced" European painting for four hundred years, it is preferable to think of it as the convention it was. This means that it was a formal invention that met certain understood needs, related to definable traditions, and allowed relationships to contemporary issues to be discussed. It may be preferable to think of all group (as opposed to individual) styles in these terms.'8 The idea of convention plays a central role in Panofsky's definition of iconography, which has become one of the major specialties of Anglo-American art history. Panofsky begins his essay on iconog- raphy and iconology, familiar to every student of the history of art, with the example of a man approaching in the street who tips his hat, a simple paradigm which he analyzes into what he calls primary and secondary characteristics. The primary characteristics he calls "for- mal," "factual," and "expressional." Considered formally, the gesture is simply a change in the configuration of lights, darks, and colors; at the next higher level of "factual meaning" the event has significance, and the configuration of lights and darks is identified as a gentleman lifting his hat; at the "expressional" level of response, the gentleman may be seen to lift his hat perfunctorily, impatiently, or even ironi- cally, from which, through a kind of empathetic relation to his move- ment, we might infer something about his frame of mind or attitude toward us. All of these primary aspects of the event are presumably available to anyone meeting a man in the street who doffs his hat. Not so the secondary significance or conventional meaning of the gesture, which "is peculiar to the Western world.... Neither an Australian bushman nor an ancient Greek could be expected to realize that the lifting of a hat is not only a practical event with certain expressional connotations, but also a sign of politeness." In the passage from pri- mary to secondary characteristics of visual experience, there is, ac- cording to Panofsky, a passage from the sensible to the intelligible and from the unconscious to the conscious. And since the secondary is called the conventional, both of these characteristics-consciousness and intelligibility-define the conventional. Panofsky transfers this analysis to works of art. "Primary or natural subject matter" is factual and expressional, kinds of pre-iconographic meaning rooted either in common experience (we see and we have seen other people) or in the feelings of the artist; secondary or conventional subject matter is iconography. Iconography is "coordinated," implying intent to be understood and understanding; it uses images, which Panofsky de- fines as "motifs recognized as carriers of a secondary or conventional meaning."19 110</page><page sequence="9">CONVENTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF ARTI Panofsky's direct transferral of an example from life to art must be questioned right at the beginning, and a number of problems flow directly from it. Even granting that his analysis of perception is cor- rect, this transferral assumes too great a transparency on the part of the work of art, assumes that it is more "realistic" than it actually is or can be. This assumption has the immediate effect of concealing the conventional nature of the work itself, which is certainly culturally determined at a level deeper than narrative, personification, or sym- bol. When, for example, we look at a synthetic cubist portrait, it is apparent as a portrait not simply because we can find a resemblance to someone amidst all the lines and planes, but rather because, al- though it may depart from conventions for the representation of form, it does not in the least depart from the conventions of portrai- ture. The subject is central and isolated, shown frontally to three- quarters on a surface the size of which is determined by a presumed spatial relation to the viewer. All of these "formal" aspects of the works are not simply formal, neither are they "natural" in a simple sense of the term, or "expressional." They are rather bearers of meaning in their own right and are as culturally defined as hat tipping. Although it is understandable that it should have become so, given the interests of its founding practitioners, it is unfortunate that iconography as a method should have become so closely identified with the traditions of classical philology and Christian theology. This is unfortunate not only because similar investigations of images and their interrelations would be valuable for the art of all cultures, but also, and most importantly, because its development in the art of one tradition tends to impose expectations about images and their mean- ing special to that tradition upon all art, when in fact such expecta- tions are deep conventions which, when modified, entail stylistic change. Iconoclasm is an extreme example of such change. The relation between form and meaning cannot be presumed to be understood from the outset in any art historical investigation. In some traditions images simply embody meaning, so that there is effectively no difference between image and meaning. In the West, where imita- tion of appearance has been a perennial concern, a figure may be a figure and nothing more and, as such, the substance of a work of art. We are accustomed to figures, in short, for which meaning is second- ary. Imitation delights irrespective of subject matter, just as, centuries later in the same tradition, pure form or pure painting delight irre- spective of subject matter. At the same time, the tradition of allegory, if not uniquely Western, still developed in close conjunction with im- itation. In allegory meaning is displaced, is stated in another way; at the same time we look at a figure that may record real or imagined appearances, we can look at it-or through it-with the expectation 1l</page><page sequence="10">NEW LITERARY HISTORY that it embodies meaning. These remarks are meant only to provide a glimpse into a problem of great complexity. But perhaps enough has been said to make it clear that understood relations of form and meaning, conventions embracing artist and audience at the deepest level, might have the most basic consequences for the definition and progress of a style. Nor should it be imagined that iconography has done all it can do for the history of its mother classical tradition. Shaped in this respect by the pronounced flattening tendency of its partner formalism, iconography treats sequences of images in the same way that style treats sequences of forms. In doing so it has blurred conventional distinctions that were clearly central to the Renaissance discussion of art and to the specific definition of alternative paths of its develop- ment. For example, in the Renaissance there was understood to be a fundamental separation between plain and difficult treatment of theme. Difficult presentation was intended for a limited audience; plain presentation was not. In my opinion it is impossible to under- stand the Renaissance debate about style, or Mannerism, or the Counter-Reformation and its impact upon art, or the basic social sig- nificance of Renaissance art without this distinction, which again was part of the critical expectation a knowledgeable Renaissance viewer took to painting. The metaphor of convention is useful precisely because it points beyond the art object in ways that are absolutely significant histori- cally. When we come to works of art as members of a culture, we "agree" to much more than iconography. Whenever a work of art is made and displayed, a whole set of behavior in response is posited, and these sets of behavior are culturally and historically specific, obvi- ously entailing the general relations of image and audience just dis- cussed. In our culture the simple act of hanging stretched canvas on a wall (especially in a museum or gallery) implies that a certain kind of behavior is in order, that the object is privileged by its very format and location. The painter has presumed such behavior as a response and concerns himself with making an object or image that will be regarded in the prescribed way. Both painter and audience, in short, are as if in agreement that a certain object demands a certain kind of considera- tion. Their behavior is "coordinated."2" For centuries-since the Renaissance-this coordination was what might be called a "deep" convention in that it was never questioned and underlay many style changes. Again, cubist paintings, which are revolutionary in some respects, continue these conventions of format, circumstances of dis- 112</page><page sequence="11">CONVENTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF ART play, and response. The work of art is still viewed as a locus for intel- lectual, aesthetic, and manual performances of a high degree of defi- nition, and this assumed definition is understood by artist and audi- ence alike. The work of art is as bounded and as historically specific and value laden as the keyboard of a piano. It may be noted too that any or all of the dimensions of the artwork may be developed. If modernism is a formal development, it may also be viewed as a sus- tained exploitation of such conventions, from Manet's Olympia to Duchamp's urinal and its endless progeny. With other emphasis, any space may be made a "gallery" space-or even a "museum" space-by putting an artwork in it, or even an artist. Aristotle remarked that when we practice an art, we do not concern ourselves with its ends but rather with how best to realize them; and artists invariably find themselves in historical situations in which an understanding of art and its function is given, one in which tech- niques and formats-although necessarily to be adjusted to needs, circumstances, and preferences-are known. For about five hundred years, to be a painter was to be a painter in oil, and during much of the same time "canvas" was a synonym for painting. If oil painting was invented in order to paint light, then more or less unconscious accep- tance of the technical conventions of oil painting meant that painters were concerned with a certain determinate area of experience, what could be seen or imagined in apparently natural light, during the centuries in which the technique was unquestioned. When paint stopped being understood as light, oil painting yielded its privileged position to become one medium among many. There are few histori- cal situations in which deep conventions are not practically uncon- scious, reduced to procedures which only seemed preliminary to the real business of painting precisely because the conventions and their significances were assumed. The simple toning of a canvas implied the scheme of light and dark within which nature would be examined or the painter's imagination would work. Within such a scheme other conventions could be more consciously examined or adapted or in- vented in portraits or histories. Even when the tradition of easel painting has been transformed and very nearly abandoned, its con- ventions continue to shape artistic activity. It is only in European painting and its tributaries that a painting is "literally" a wooden stretcher with canvas tacked to it, and literalist painting would have looked very different at the end of a long tradition of painting on scrolls. Such continuities, which of course involve correlative con- tinuities of display and reaction to works of art, are visible as conven- tions, which imply not only technical continuity but continuity of cul- 113</page><page sequence="12">NEW LITERARY HISTORY turally specific and significant patterns of behavior and assumed meaning. The solipsistic poetry of de Kooning's late painting is visible not because of its formal properties but rather in the embrace of the tradition of the understood significance of painting itself. James Ackerman, with the evident intention of magnifying its social historical usefulness, has considerably broadened the concept of style by allying it closely with convention.21 He defines style as a "means of establishing relationships among individual works of art," and when listing the constituents of style, that is, those characteristics of art objects that best allow them to be placed in relationship to one an- other, he cites "conventions of form and symbolism." He defines convention as "an accepted vocabulary of elements-a scale of color, an architectural order, an attribute of a god or saint." Convention also functions at a higher level, and what Ackerman calls "syntax" corre- sponds to the composition of elements into "a still life, a temple, a frieze." This definition of style is at base taxonomic, but rather than simply saying that we can relate works of art on the basis of formal similarities (conventions of form), Ackerman also says that we can group them iconographically, as in fact, to take an extreme example, we can separate an image of Quetzalcoatl from a group of trecento manuscript pages without recourse to further formal or technical analysis. The style of an individual, Ackerman argues, is observed in the "interaction of his private conventions and the public conventions of his time and place." "Private conventions" seems to me to be a con- tradiction in terms. If it means something like individual habits or mannerisms, these themselves are conventional. In the art of many cultures such habits and mannerisms are not evident in art because they are not valued. We, on the other hand, possess a code for self- expression. Gestural fracture, nondescriptive drawing and color, and arbitrarily combined images are familiar features of this code. These have a conventional significance prior to any private meaning they may have to the artist, and correspond to the expectation that art be more or less alienated self-expression. Ackerman in fact stresses convention in its interpersonal dimension. "Conventions," he writes, "like language, are the basic vehicle for the communication of mean- ing," so that "society aids the artist in promoting their stability and in controlling the rate, the degree, and even the nature of their change." As examples of such control of conventions, Ackerman cites the de- termination of religious art by religious establishments, and "land- scape painting or recent abstract art, which are sustained, if not for- mulated, by the needs of an economically powerful class." 114</page><page sequence="13">CONVENTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF ART Although convention is important in Ackerman's definition, it has by no means achieved neutrality. As it has been since Romanticism, convention is at best a compromise of the artist's creativity and at worst a kind of thought control of which the artist is the more or less unwitting agent. Having raised the issue of convention, it would be best to hold to the most general statement-"conventions, like lan- guage, are basic to the communication of meaning"-and to try to ascertain the depth to which works of art are meaningful when thus defined. The definition of style as convention, although it may more nearly describe the use of style, seriously curtails the usefulness of the idea of convention because it imposes a periodization upon conventions that is incidental to them. In practice-in art history texts, for example- periodization implies radical difference, and we try to say what essen- tially distinguishes the Middle Ages from the Renaissance or the Re- naissance from the Baroque. Thus two periods that share much in common are treated as if they were unrelated traditions. Since art history has been mostly concerned with the Western tradition, this habit of periodization has made the Western tradition itself seem much less unified than it actually is. We may consider the example of modeling. As Gombrich has argued in several places, modeling in painting is a Western preoccupation that began in antiquity and in one form or another has been practiced continuously ever since.22 This deeply implicative convention remains invisible in stylistically periodized histories of Western art precisely because it is a constant. Iconographic studies often span periods in a way that stylistic studies do not, but here too figures or compositions that can be called "con- ventional" mostly go unnoticed, or are only treated in passing, as they concern the art of a region or period. Figures with their heads resting on one hand or sleeping figures with their arms crooked behind their heads, for example, have continuous histories from antiquity to the twentieth century. Grotesques provide a similar example. Perhaps because their meanings are generic and they can be related to no one text or theme, or because their repetition is not considered "creative," such hardy perennial signifiers go unstudied. No account of the idea of convention in the history of art would be complete without a consideration of E. H. Gombrich's theory of "schema and correction," which has been recognized as a significant contribution to the theory of style since the publication of his Art and Illusion in 1960.23 Gombrich's attitude toward convention itself is am- bivalent; he very often uses the term to mean arbitrary relative to nature-writing, for example, of "schematic and conventionalized 115</page><page sequence="14">NEW LITERARY HISTORY styles" of medieval art; but on the same page he also writes of the "naturalistic conventions" of ancient art and summarizes his own Art and Illusion to say in essence that "all art operates with conceptual or conventional symbols."4 Although Gombrich avoids the consistent use of the term convention-probably because of the negative connota- tions of the term we have discussed-other art historians have adapted and generalized his model, no doubt because it presumes the involvement of the artist in the history of art and provides a theoreti- cal basis for the investigation of broader historical connections.25 According to Gombrich's theory certain styles-he limits himself almost exclusively to Western examples-operate between two poles, art and visible nature. Given the impulse to imitate nature, it is never the case that artists simply copy what they see. Instead they begin from relevant "conventional" images that are compared to the kind of thing to which they correspond and corrected in light of it. So the Greek kouros began as a static, frontal schema that through successive "matchings" over several generations of artistic effort came closer and closer to the description of real figures. Gombrich argues that visual reality can be approached in no other way. Perhaps because we all have eyes, into which, we have come to understand, geometrically regular light rays pass to a regularly curved retina, we think that an artist can "match" his paintings against what is caught in this "little net" whenever he wishes. But there is little in the history of art to suggest that such reference is possible. "Opti- cal" styles typically stand at the end of long developments and retain something of the extraoptical style series to which they belong, so that Eyckian naturalism, for example, is unmistakably Gothic, and Greek naturalism at its highest development retains something of the character of the archaic members of the style. Heinrich Wolfflin stressed the idea that painting is about painting, that landscape refers as much to previous landscape as it does to any real or imaginary scene. This definition of painting as an autonomous tradition, separate from representation (which paralleled the defini- tion of painting itself as a similarly autonomous art), was essential to Wolfflin's theory of style, which he developed psychologically. Gom- brich's bent is also psychological-if toward a very different kind of psychology-but his schemata are much more broadly implicated historically than W6lfflin's forms. Schemata need not be simply visual and may easily be generalized, as we may consider in this example. For decades Leonardo's early skull studies were regarded as miracles of empirical observation. This judgment itself was a projection of expectation over data, a consequence of Leonardo's rank as a patron 116</page><page sequence="15">CONVENTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF ART saint of empiricism. The drawings actually record something more complex than the direct examination of nature.26 Leonardo probably began with the head because it was considered the most important part of the body; and his explorations of the skull cavity, as his notes explain, were an attempt to discover the physiological basis of what seems to have been a private version of medieval faculty psychology, which he corroborated to his satisfaction. The result of his activity was a combination of prior definition, or schema, and the natural config- uration of skulls, which became the limit for his subsequent explana- tions and those of others. Here, it is important to note, the original schema involved is not simply visual, and one must look beyond the earlier history of anatomical illustration to a more general considera- tion of contemporary psychology to find the point from which Leonardo began his examination of nature. Discussion of the idea of convention has flared up around the question of perspective, and a brief examination of this debate may help to discern the issues involved a little more clearly. Herbert Read, repeating a thought often to be found with variations in texts on modern art, wrote that "the theory of perspective developed in the fifteenth century is a scientific convention; it is merely one way of describing space and has no absolute validity."27 By a "scientific con- vention" he seems to mean that perspective is a kind of scientific notation, like a graph, that makes relations at once visible and intelli- gible without "imitating nature"; and by calling perspective a conven- tion, he clearly means to say that it is more or less arbitrary since space may be truly represented in other ways. These words irked E. H. Gombrich, who evidently believes that perspective is, or can be, objec- tive, by which is meant that it is not a convention but rather an artistic means rooted in nature and in the nature of perception. Perspective is, in short, a schema that cannot be corrected.28 Nelson Goodman set out to show that perspective construction is very different from the perception of what it shows and that, as painters seem always to have recognized, it must be corrected and manipulated in order to produce desired results, thus disagreeing with Gombrich.29 The question of perspective as a convention thus turns around the familiar alterna- tives of nature and culture. Gombrich believes that perspective rep- resents the state of affairs that it seems to represent, and Goodman believes that it is only one code among many. Since they meet on the historical Flatland of the psychology of perception, in the adequacy of which they both seem to believe, neither writer considers the question historically, and from a historical standpoint perspective is clearly a convention, the ultimate decision of the psychologists notwithstand- 117</page><page sequence="16">NEW LITERARY HISTORY ing. When Brunelleschi invented perspective, he intended his con- struction to approximate the physical process of vision; and he also probably realized what was soon seen by others, that there were anomalies in the construction that led to inconsistencies with visual experience. But even if it is the case that perspective construction may more or less correspond to the geometry of space, light, and the eye, the realization that this is so does not have the significance it once had, nor had either the possibility or the desire to make images based on such a correspondence always existed. A theory of light that would have allowed such a construction to be made did not exist in the West until the thirteenth century, and the demand for "optical" images did not arise until the late Middle Ages. "Painter's perspective" thus was a convention in the very real sense that it arose in specific historical circumstances and by implication states a new consensus about the senses, the mind, and the world. The invention was also not safe in the arms of nature once found. It was pointedly rejected by the founders of modernism, who set about to root their inventions in a new sense of reality.30 That their new conventions correspond to a new consensus is evident in the historical viability and integrity of modernism itself. Gombrich's theory of schema and correction, although generaliz- able in the manner described, is in itself a theory that accounts for stylistic change in traditions in which the imitation of nature is a goal uniting long periods of artistic activity.31 Since the imitation of nature is not a goal in all cultures, or even in most cultures, and is therefore not a motive force in the development-or relative lack of development-of their art, it may be worthwhile to try to formulate a more general principle, one that is able to embrace other patterns of change. Obviously the idea of convention provides a way of discussing the conservative component of change, and in what follows I shall consider a simple example that will lead us to what I shall call a principle of definition. Traveling across the country, one finds a variety of kinds of wooden fences, which are generally typical of regions. Various factors may explain these differences in appearance: the local wood, the availability of tools or nails, the land to be fenced, the weather to be withstood, the animals to be kept in or out. The kind of fence made in any region may even reflect more or less immediately remembered fences seen in other places, and may thus reflect the history or background of a local person or group. But there is also another factor that only a faith in simple determinism might bar from con- sideration: the problem of building a wooden fence may be solved in a number of ways. Since it may be solved, that is, since its configuration over and above what is required by material or functional necessity is 118</page><page sequence="17">CONVENTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF ART not defined by the circumstances leading up to it, it may be called arbitrary (which means according to choice or judgment or will). This is not to say that an infinite number of fence solutions may be imag- ined and the possible number of such solutions may more or less coincide with the list of types of wooden fences that have been built. It is simply to say that the characteristic appearance of the fence is not the vector sum of preceding conditions, that it is radically undetermined. Arbitrariness implies choice and judgment. But the choice of the builder or builders who make the first fence is not the same as the choice of builders who come afterward. The potentially endlessly variable characteristics of the initial choice are magnified to the point of being qualitatively different from choices that come afterward; this is because the first formulation defines the concept of a fence. Although someone may always build a different-appearing fence, most who come after will not; they will build a fence more or less like the first one, which becomes a literally definitive utterance. It may also be noted that insofar as the appearance is radically undetermined, there is no external cause for its change. The importance of this principle of definition for the history of art cannot be overstated. A formulation once arrived at may have almost perfect authority simply because it is identified with the thing that it is. Once definition (or invention) has occurred, the fence form begins to have a historical life. Not only does it become a prime object in an identifiable formal sequence but, precisely in doing so, it becomes a convention. As such, it may acquire extraformal values, values that contribute to its transformations. It may be adapted to various cir- cumstances, improved in relation to function, ornamented and re- fined. It may become consciously local and identified with the region to which it is peculiar, like a dialect. It might even become a conscious element of local architecture, thus to survive style changes or to be rejected together with other regionalisms. If the hypothetical history of a wooden fence seems tedious and even trivial, the principle to be extracted from the example can easily be applied to much more important issues. The actual origin of any style of representation may be imagined to be equally indeterminate, and the repetitions of its first utterances (which, unlike those of lan- guage, are made by a small number of people) come to define images and the way they are made. If most images are bounded by lines, they may be bounded by lines in a great number of ways. Once bounded, however, they tend to become definitive for the social group that uses them. Thus Minoan painting arose not from the will to form of the Minoans but from an undetermined response of a painter or group of 119</page><page sequence="18">NEW LITERARY HISTORY painters to specific circumstances; and this response became au- thoritative for subsequent painters and perhaps self-consciously identified with their group, much in the way that their language was. Many cultures encourage the maintenance of images once set, which means that these cultures tend to maintain the identity of con- cept and image, which is in a certain sense the more natural alterna- tive. If the making of images and their consequent definition is also identified with the value of what the image embodies-which cer- tainly occurs-then this would provide a powerful reinforcement to what must very nearly be regarded as an epistemological necessity. There is thus a radical disrelation between the condition of an inventor and that of one for whom the invention already exists, for whom invention is convention. This phrase of George Kubler's is to be taken literally.32 It means that the later craftsman will behave as if it were agreed that the invention defined its concept. And it must be stressed that this does not mean that the definition will simply be repeated. It may be modified or adapted or corrected or improved or even replaced. But none of these will occur independently of the original definition. It may also be noted that definition does not sim- ply imply representation. A certain kind of ornament may become identical with ornament, which may account for the endless life of certain formally unobvious motifs. In the terms we are discussing, the imitation of nature becomes something of an anomaly, resulting from the presumed displacement of the reality of the image. Still, the reality of the image, its identifica- tion with its concept, may account for the relative slowness with which naturalism develops. Even though the imitation of nature is a shared value, and even if such an intention is evident in finished works, the tendency toward concept is stronger than that toward percept. Those elements of the image that are "conventional," in short, are held to more strongly than those that are "natural." And in fact it is the communicable aspects of the work-proportion, composition, craft-that are still evident, the stylistic component in a completed naturalistic style. Modern art historical method began with the dissociation of histor- ical categories from the categories of neoclassical criticism, which had previously been confounded. It began with the gradual elevation of the periods of Western art to positions of more or less equality, so that the whole tradition might be viewed as a sequence of equally valid developments rather than as a sequence of approaches to and declines from classical moments. Heinrich Wolfflin changed baroque from a term of abuse for a period of decadence into a neutral style phase necessarily related to classical styles. Alois Riegl confronted the 120</page><page sequence="19">CONVENTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF ART greatest decline of them all, the end of the Roman Empire and the beginning of the Dark Ages, and established this period both as the fulfillment and transformation of the classical artistic tradition and as a necessary link to the modern world. As is well known, Riegl argued that every style is the expression of a characteristic Kunstwollen and that the task of the historian of art is the articulation of the "wills to form" as they are evident in diverse styles. It is from such a base that the history of art as a kind of universal cultural history has had its origins. Just as classicism was based on the idea that imitation was rooted in the order of nature or in the consonance between the mind and nature, the new stylistic relativism, which raised all styles to the same level, implied that all styles were conventional, that is, not in them- selves grounded in nature. Wolfflin even referred to his two "modes of representation as such," the linear and the painterly, as "two lan- guages, in which everything can be said."33 But in general the impli- cations of stylistic relativism have not been developed by historians of art.34 The idea of convention has remained essentially negative, and for good reason. Were it to become neutral, and were the systematic implications of the idea that "all art operates with conceptual or con- ventional symbols" to be developed, it would require the severing of the last ties of art to nature, it would limit the applicability of classical standards to any art except that of the Western tradition, and it would require therefore that the essential filiations of artistic activity be sought in history and culture. The conception of art historical change as a continuous sequence of formal innovations, some variations or refinements, some inventions that begin new sequences, corresponds to a notion of "creativity" and "originality" that is in itself a convention, a specific historical assump- tion about a relation with many possible historical forms. The stone masks of Teotihuacan were not made by the same person; rather, they were made by artisans in a society in which the repetition of a definite type of significant object was considered both desirable and necessary. The relation of convention and invention is not always the same, and the assumption that the inward formal imaginative history of the individual artist is the prime force in art historical change obscures this. The obvious point that all art is made by artists cannot support such an assumption. And the equally truistic agreement that all art is of its time is not a sufficient means to the demonstration of how it is of its time. Many art historical problems-and mystifications- vanish if we proceed from the positive principle that the act of making art-even an act of the greatest originality-is embraced and nourished by historical conditions and that it is in essence and in all its 121</page><page sequence="20">NEW LITERARY HISTORY aspects a meaningful act in those circumstances. The metaphor of convention states such a principle; the metaphor of style does not. In such an essay as this it is difficult to develop concrete proposals. But finally, by way of illustration more than anything else, we may consider that the idea of convention considerably clarifies certain general stylistic phenomena. We may consider the example of re- finement. The Greeks did not continually reinvent the Doric order; rather, they behaved as if they had agreed to it and continually re- fined its elements and their combinations. Thus a conventional order became a sounding board against which and because of which aes- thetic issues could be defined and investigated. Similarly, Mayan ar- chitects never devised an alternative to the corbel arch but refined it to the heights of the architecture of Palenque and Uxmal. In general, highly developed styles of ornament are high developments precisely of conventional forms and patterns. And to take a more complex but still related example, Leonardo invented a style of painting that lasted for four hundred years by endlessly reconsidering the most conven- tional themes: an Adoration of the Magi, a St. Sebastian, Madonnas in various combinations with other figures. Here once again conven- tional themes provided a fixed base for the definition of problems and solutions which, to the degree that they succeeded and became elements of a new style, became conventions in their own right. At the beginning of modern painting, in the painting of Cezanne or early Cubism, the most straightforward conventions of landscape, portrait, and still life "stood still" while the conventions of the representation of virtual forms were analyzed in ways that proved revolutionary. And again the new forms were revolutionary precisely because they were the first utterance of a new set of conventions, the transformation of one significant set of elements into a newly significant set of elements. It should also be stressed that convention bears upon artistic activity in various ways; in some cultures conventions are definitions and usage is consequently respected. In our time and place, conventions are to be shunned at all costs (as long as we do things that are "modern"), an attitude that has had very tangible art historical consequences. In the classical and Renaissance traditions a kind of mean was struck. Art was very nearly identified with a set of acknowledged conventions that were used well or poorly. An inventor in such circumstances was one who contributed to the art at one level or another. The idea of artistic convention as a positively specialized language-rather more like po- etry or music-which to my mind stood at the heart of the Renais- sance understanding of art is perhaps more alien to us than the other extreme of art strictly bounded by usage. In this essay I have consciously avoided the word semiotic. I have 122</page><page sequence="21">CONVENTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF ART done this because use of the word implies the imposition of a method arising from the study of language, which is not only other than art but different from art. Whereas everyone speaks, only minorities are image and object makers in any significant sense, and the relation of speaker to audience is consequently very different, as is the relation between signifier and signified. Art has realizing and embodying functions different from language, and evidence of having been made or of scale of object or of act of making are significant as they are not in language. Such a list is only the beginning of the necessary process of defining the differences (and similarities) between these two fundamental regions of significance. At the same time, this essay should have made it clear that the development of a general semiotic approach, based on the assumption that art in all of its levels and in all of its elements is significant, would permit the concrete address of art historical problems, both purely art historical problems, like stylistic change, and broader social and historical problems as well. UNIVERSI'TY OF VIRGINIA NOTES 1 "Effective origins," because some conventions, say classical forms used in the Re- naissance, were made in one period but have another cultural significance in the other. 2 David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, bk. 3, pt. 2, sec. 2. 3 Picasso, speaking in 1945, took a remarkably linguistic view of painting. Poussin's painting is accepted as "true nature" because his "syntax is well established .... it isn't anything more than a question of signs. It has been agreed upon that a specific sign represents a tree, another a house, a man, a woman; exactly as in language the word 'man' evokes the image of a man ... although in every language the word varies. It's an established convention, we communicate by the use of these signs." See Picasso on Art: A Selection of Views, ed. Dore Ashton (New York, 1972), pp. 18-19. 4 See the Century Dictionary (New York, 1911), s.v. "conventional," def. 5: "Depending on accepted models or traditions, irrespective of independent study of nature; tradi- tionally or purposely deviating from natural forms, although properly retaining the principles which underlie them: as, the conventional forms of birds, beasts, flowers, etc., in heraldry and on coins." 5 See, e.g., in agreement, Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Lan- guage, 1978 ed., s.v. "conventional," def. 3: "not natural, original, or spontaneous .... 4. stylized." 6 E.g., Arnold Hauser, The Philosophy of Art History (Cleveland and New York, 1963), p. 369.

In the absence of other evidence we must suppose that graduated sequences correspond to the order of execution of objects. But such hypotheses must yield to other evidence, say documentary or stratigraphic. Similarly, in the absence of other evidence we suppose that the Minoans were in fact attuned to the dynamics of nature. 13 Meyer Schapiro, "Style," in Aesthetics Today, ed.

Assuming the significance of formal continuities, and further assuming the involvement of art in culture as a whole, its only partial specialization, it may be possible to proceed by a kind of hypothetical analogy to similar conclusions in other periods. 19 Erwin Panofsky, Meaning in the Visual Arts: Papers in and on Art History (Garden City, N.Y., 1955), pp. 26-31; also in his Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance (New York, 1962), pp. 3-13. 20 Use of this term owes to David K.

Or Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, "Cubism," in Modern Artists on Art: Ten Unabridged Essays, ed. Robert L. Herbert (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1964), p. 8. 31 The "paradigms" of Thomas S. Kuhn (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions [Chicago and London, 1970]) have crept into art historical usage. For example, Svet- lana Alpers ("Style is What You Make It: The Visual Arts Once Again," in The Concept of Style, p. 117) wonders if the old Rembrandt was not perhaps "like the aging scientists described by Thomas Kuhn, simply out of touch with the current paradigm of style." For Kuhn, paradigms are principles of both continuity and transformation and are intended to meet the kinds of problems addressed by the metaphor of convention, but beyond that the general similarity between the activity of art communities and scientific communities does not seem apt, except perhaps in the case of the development of naturalism, a comparison made by Kuhn himself. 32 George Kubler, The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things (New Haven and London, 1962), pp. 67-68. 33 Wolfflin, Principles, p. 12. 34 It might be pointed out that even in the Romantic period the opposition of nature and convention was not always negative. The greatest Romantic painter of them all, Eugiene Delacroix (see above, n. 29), distinguished between convention and "realism," arguing that even painters who call themselves realists do not simply mirror what is before them, but rather use "certain conventions of composition and execution." The conventions to which he refers are evidently the tacit agreement among painters that certain things are necessary to good painting over and above subject matter. Here the usages of painting itself are separated from representation in a way that summarizes a tradition of theory and practice at the same time that it looks forward to abstraction. LaterJean Metzinger, in defense of cubism, extended this understanding of convention by likening the "conventional" aspects of painting to music, the exemplum par excel- lence for abstraction, an art that imitated, expressed, and constructed entirely in its own terms. See Edward F. Fry, "Cubism 1907-8: An Early Eyewitness Account," Art Bulle- tin, 48 (1966), 72. Again, Gleizes and Metzinger write of "objective or conventional reality," meaning that the "real world" is radically historical and finally "chimerical" and therefore to be transcended by the painter ("Cubism," pp. 14- 18). See also Picasso in n. 3 above. The impact of such ideas on the separation of painting from subject matter would bear investigation.</page></plain_text>
