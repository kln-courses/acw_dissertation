<plain_text><page sequence="1">William I vins 's Taste in Prints Majorie B. Cohn William M. Ivins, Jr. (1881-1961) was the most influ- ential writer on printmaking of the early twentieth century. In books, articles and exhibition labels, he worked through the theory of the multiple, focussed attention on the generative r√¥le of technique and set forth printmaking as the pragmatic international vehi- cle of visual information, all in passionate opposition to the idealist aesthetic norms of his time that were con- ventionally proposed as the culmination of artistic progress. In 19 17 Ivins was given a bully pulpit by his position: he was appointed as the first Curator of Prints at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, through the good offices of Paul J. Sachs, after the latter declined to return to New York from the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University, where he had just become the Assistant Director. By 'taste in prints' I mean Ivins's partiality for spe- cific printmakers or particular sorts of prints, a person- al bias that could run counter to his professional obligation to found a comprehensive collection and also to the generalizing pronouncements of his pub- lished legacy. While indulging in a constant disparage- ment of taste in others, he set the boundaries of his own without in any way defining it: 'Taste is what I like.'1 i. T. Sizer, 'William M. Ivins, Jr. (1881-1961), "Fog Dispeller'", Tale University Library Gazette, xxxvi, 4, April 1962, p. 170. Sizer quali- fied this quote by saying that it was uttered 'sarcastically'. PRINT QUARTERLY, XXII, 2OO5, I</page><page sequence="2">32 WILLIAM IVINS'S TASTE What it was that Ivins 'liked' is, perhaps, best revealed in his personal and unpublished writings. Ivins foreswore taste as the basis for acquisitions at the Metropolitan, and his 'official' writings, opinionat- ed and idiosyncratic as they may be, are more reveal- ing of his intellect than of his artistic biases. Yet he had started out life not only as a lawyer, which was forma- tive for his intellect, but also, in Carl Zigrosser's words, as 'an intelligent but modest collector at Keppel's print shop'.2 Note how even here Zigrosser characterizes him by his intelligence rather than his taste. Zigrosser went on to comment: 'In his vehement intellectual life, Ivins somehow lacked much aesthetic sensibility. Several artists have told me they doubted whether he ever experienced a real emotion before a work of art . . ..'3 What I shall quote from Ivins's own letters will contradict that published report. His taste is most in evidence in his correspondence, especially in his con- tinuing 'conversation' by mail with Sachs, who, when still resident in New York, had been his frequent companion on early visits to Keppel. What, then, did Ivins 'like', as opposed to think well of? As with all of us, over a lifetime his likes and dislikes were not set in stone. Indeed, giving the lie to any charge of frozen emotions or sensibility, Ivins himself commented on the transformations in his taste. In 1918 he recalled to Sachs, 'Fifteen years ago I had the Rodin fever bad ... I was a good deal like a small child that has tasted nut sundae for the first time - and full of a deep purple spotted most intelligent aesthetical atti- tude which was ever so much holier than any number of thous - the reaction has been so great that today I fear I chew "baccer".'4 The mature Ivins did not like the 'art for art's sake' aesthetic constellation, and his developing intellect bred suspicion of the aesthete's thrill, even though he did not deny its gratifications. And so he wrote to Sachs, who at the time was in the throes of an aesthet- ic response: In my foolish way, when you went into extasies [sic] over your Cambodian head, I was very glad that you were so happy over it - but nevertheless I had my reserves ... for I have frequently been intoxicated that way myself and later have cooled off. That species of intoxication is one of the rarest and finest pleasures a man can have . . .5 Sachs, like Ivins, had made a mid-life move away from a career in the world of finance. Years after they had embarked on their respective museum jobs, Ivins remembered a Sunday outing on the beach (try to imagine either of these monuments of museum history in bathing suits!): Lord! man, how long ago that all was! when you were going to be the greatest banker on earth and I was working my gizzards out trying to get the half- Nelson on the craft of drawing corporate mortgages, and we were both very solemn serious amachoors of prints. Cambridge and the Metropolitan were both undreamed of . . .6 Ivins's letters to Sachs were often tempestuously emotional. As he confessed: You see, old dear, I'm not really grown up in some ways, I'm nervous and excitable and my emotions are not under the full control they should have . . . It's as though I had a set of values and a sensory apparatus which were out of touch, out of scale, with those of the world . . .7 But it is in his outbursts of enthusiasm and rage, when they are associated with art topics, that one gets a glimpse of personal taste, of his 'likes'. Typically, its definition is seen most clearly in what the contrarian Ivins did not like, specifically two of the collecting pas- sions of the conservative elite of his youth: etchings by the principal heroes of the French and British Etching Revival, and woodcuts and book design by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement more gen- erally. About the Etching Revival, Ivins said: [T]urn to the [real] history of black and white in the Nineteenth Century . . . [and] mere manual skill . . . cookery of process, in short the whole group of things that are connotated under the general head- ing of truth to medium, that great fetich [sic] of the latter end of the Nineteenth Century, fall by the side as immaterial.8 During his first year as Curator, Ivins told Sachs that he was planning a series of informal talks to 'beat the side show tom tom and make folks come visit the study room'. The fourth and fifth presentations would be on 2. C. Zigrosser, A World of Art and Museums , Philadelphia 1975, p. 198. The brief chapter on Ivins characterizes the man perfectly. 3.

To quote Ivins from a published article: The mere fact that Morris thought that books should be judged not by their literary or artistic con- tent but by how they looked when seen two pages at a time, i.e., in a way in which it is impossible to see what either the writer or artist has done, and to see only what the interior decorator has done, . . . should be sufficient answer to the validity of his teaching.13 Here 'interior decorator' must be read as his syn- onym for the man of taste, exactly the sort of personal- ity that Ivins abhorred. Even among early printed books, Ivins did not agree with received wisdom in that he did not rank most German incunabula at all highly. His remarks on the earliest German productions give a clue to why in his years at the Metropolitan he never acquired any twen- tieth-century German Expressionist prints: Germany was a splayfooted land . . . much of it in a condition but little removed from savagery ... [It] was in no position to welcome or take an interest in the new cultural ideas that had been developing in Italy . . . Germany displayed a lack of interest in them that amounted to the stoutest of resistances to them, displaying a provincial stubbornness of the kind that passes for quaint, but that in reality is poverty stricken and stupid.14 He alluded to 'the typical German discomfort and unhappiness in the presence of disciplined form'15 in the context of praising early Italian books, in which ≈•the Italian culture and definite, clean-cut attitude toward life and art showed themselves . . .'16 In his letter of application to the Metropolitan Museum, dated 3 December 1916, Ivins claimed that as a Harvard undergraduate, 'D√ºrer came to me as a rev- elation,'17 yet he would later write that 'The reason for the vast and overwhelming superiority of [D√ºrer's] Apocalypse . . . is . . . [because] he had in the meantime sojourned in Venice . . .'18 And so it was sixteenth- and not fifteenth-century German woodcuts that were more to Ivins's taste. As he wrote to Sachs, 'I have . . . a hunch that they are . . . greater than even I have thought . . . Burkmair [sic] and Baldung . . . whether they are not perhaps the really very great, with D√ºrer, the rockbottom important men.'19 In this connection, it should be noted that he had a completely different opinion about the analogous German engravings. With regard to the Little Masters, Ivins wrote to Sachs that he had 'never thought ... of them save in rather derogatory terms [although] Aldegrever rather amus- es me . . . because of a certain wholly sartorial style'.20 Even with the greatest German master, Ivins favoured woodcuts over engravings, and he selected D√ºrer's litde St George and the Dragon over every other departmental acquisition by any artist to illustrate the successes of the first five years of his curatorship.21 Ivins also gave an impression of the woodcut as a wedding present to his close friends Bryson Burroughs, Curator of Paintings at the Metropolitan, and Louise Guerber, another museum staff member, who were among the very few of his colleagues whom he did not disparage in his correspondence and diaries (fig. 17). Thus Ivins's personal impression of this print did not figure in his estate sale, but among the other German Old Masters that he owned at his death, practically all were wood- cuts, including full sets of D√ºrer's Little Passion and Altdorfer's Fall and Redemption of Man.22 It was in the context of early Italian woodcuts that Ivins gave Sachs a definition of great prints: 'real prints - that were made for a purpose - and that are good pic- tures and decoration. ... [A] print is only a picture or an ornament and should be judged as such . . .'23 Early Italian books illustrated with woodcuts combined his favorite 'likes' - ornament, woodcuts and books. Ivins especially latched on to the virtues of an Aesop printed in Verona in 1479, perhaps because in doing so he could pick an argument with Alfred Pollard, cataloguer of the British Museum collection and the pre-eminent authority in this genre. Where Pollard saw 'clumsiness', Ivins saw 'a dash and verve and an inventiveness rare enough at any time . . .'24 It was this very book that he used to test the young Elizabeth (Betty) Mongan, who went to New York to ask his opinion of a Schongauer acquisition that Lessing Rosenwald was considering.25 13.

Since she not only knew but liked the book, Ivins must have recognized a femi- nine force to be reckoned with - something that rarely entered his professional calculations. Hyatt Mayor simplified the situation in his analysis of what Ivins bought for his museum: ≈•He was a great respector of traditionell opinion . . .'26 and '. . . if a print had been good enough for Pierre Jean Mariette, Adam Bartsch, or the Goncourts, it was good enough for the Metropolitan Museum'.27 This reliance on historical (as opposed to contemporary) precedent - Mayor noted that this was only appropriate for 'a good lawyer' - seems to have governed Ivins's private tastes, too. His personal heroes, beyond D√ºrer and Rembrandt, were Blake, Daumier and above all Goya, and modern artists rarely interested him.28 His estate sales contained one extremely atypical Matisse drawing, and Matisse was the only pre-eminent modern printmaker whose work he collected for the Metropolitan. Ivins also owned two Marin watercolours, probably bought from Stieglitz's 291 Gallery, a hangout in his youth. There and then he was quite willing to accept photography as an art - something that cannot be guessed from his later published writings, where his characterization of photography as a transparent medium has compro- mised his theories of graphic art for later scholars. The case of Picasso is fascinating. During Ivins's tenure the Metropolitan Museum acquired only a few of the most sedate sort of Picasso prints, but in a letter to Sachs written prior to either man's museum career, Ivins reported on a visit 'to Photo Secession', that is, to Stieglitz's gallery, where he had seen a Picasso draw- ing.29 By his description, it must have been a synthetic Cubist collage, which was 'perfectly meaningless to me . . . the sheerest idiocy. No representation of anything at all.' Yet he found it 'curiously interesting - piquing my mind and theories', in other words, his intellect but perhaps not his taste. He studied it in an attempt to learn what makes a 'good drawing as distinct from a bad drawing'. And do you know, after looking at it for some time it impressed me in a most curious way as an expression of volition on the part of its creator - the work of a man who had an actively working mind and who was trying desperately to work out some problem. And then it went even further, it gave me an absolute sensation of pleasure, of order and rhythm and bal- ance - and yet I could not see any representation in it at all, there was nothing to which it responded in my memory in the way of calling up things previ- ously seen, or of bringing out things once seen, but imperfectly. There was no 'drawing' in it at all - because how can there be 'drawing' when there is no representation to refer it back to. Ivins could not get the abstract Picasso out of his mind, and he associated it with another artwork he saw the same day at another gallery, D√ºrer's Nemesis , or Great Fortune. [T|t seems as though there were a kinship between those two things, as though somehow they had a strain of the same blood . . . and this in spite of the fact that the Picasso has no representative quality and the D√ºrer is compact of it. But in the D√ºrer there is more than representation of recognizable things, more than the vague sentiment of mystery, of unfathomed allegory with which most folks stop. (Of course the mere question of handicraft, or texture, of 'sweet' line, of finish, is all aside from the point here . . . although Lord knows the Great Fortune has most amazing technical passages in it.) There is some- thing in the D√ºrer, or, if you prefer, something in the Picasso that strikes the same fundamental note as is struck in the Great Fortune. Ivins's denial of a substantive r√¥le for technical artistry (viz. his focus on generative technique in his later, classic How Prints Look ) allowed him to pass beyond even the sensed commonality of a Picasso col- lage and a D√ºrer engraving as a criterion for quality in drawing. He wilfully mixed apples and oranges, that is, works of visual art in which the designer is also the maker, with literary works, which could be spoken, written out, or set into intelligible type by someone other than their creator: 26.

Hyatt Mayor, 'William Mills Ivins, Jr., 1881-1961', Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, xxi, 6, February 1963, p. 196. Mayor qual- ified Ivins's reliance on past judgement to apply to prints by artists that did not 'speak to him [Ivins] of things which he can neither repeat nor explain', that is, not to prints by Mantegna, Rembrandt, Goya and D√ºrer. 28. Ibid. In fairness, a proposal from Ivins to Sachs in a letter of 19 June 1916, after Sachs had gone to Harvard but before Ivins was hired by the Metropolitan Museum, must be mentioned. Ivins proposed that Walter Pach should give a series of lectures at Harvard on modern French art, from David to Picasso, Matisse, Duchamp and Picabia, although he admitted that the lectures 'would not appeal ... to the "eternal academic" because they would not be safe . . .' Ivins even suggested that the series be 'topped off with a talk by Duchamp himself who is a very charm- ing intelligent fellow who talks the most distinguished French you could imagine'. In a subsequent letter (12 July 1916) Ivins withdrew his suggestion, giving as his reason Pach's reported deficiencies as a lecturer. 29. Ivins to Sachs, i6January 1915.</page><page sequence="7">WILLIAM rVINS'S TASTE 37 [T]he goodness or badness of a drawing depends very little on the . . . mere manual qualities of the thing - which . . . has no more to do with the quali- ty of a drawing than the quality of a philosopher's or poet's voice has to do with the worth of his writings. . . . [What] really counted was not the way the thing was said but what it was that was said, and that noth- ing was ever said unless there was volition back of the utterance, not the volition that was concerned with manner but with matter . . . [OJnly a very few artists have gone beyond [manuali skill] and reached the point where they no longer thought about it, a point where the difficulties . . . were those of thought or expression. After several days and many digressions, Ivins con- cluded this twelve-page letter to Sachs, in which he also cited William Blake's wood-engraving of 'the riven oak in the storm', by saying that D√ºrer and Blake in these two instances were lucky to have had symbols that were true qua their own minds and at the same time complete enough as rep- resentation to have carried across the gulf that sepa- rates all human beings one from the other. Picasso was not lucky enough to have had such a fully rep- resentational symbol . . . but at the same time he has succeeded in getting across the gulf a feeling that here is a man consciously honesdy trying to put down his symbol. To posterity's frustration, Sachs underlined the above passages, in some places multiple times, as if he had read them over and over, but he annotated the let- ter, 'Answ[ered] in person', and so we shall never learn what America's leading (but nascent) drawing connois- seur thought either of the Picasso or of Ivins's convo- luted argument. It should be noted, however, that while Sachs gave or bequeathed 46 drawings and prints by Picasso to the Fogg, none was so radical in composition or technique as the synthetic Cubist collage. For Ivins, a radically modern Picasso and even the D√ºrer were tools for analysis, not art to 'like'; he closed his ruminations to Sachs by saying, 'you are the only man I know . . . [who would] see the importance of the effort to formulate the theory of the things we both care so much for'. This is doubly ironic, first because Sachs did not have an analytical or theorizing bone in his body, as he would freely admit to Ivins in a later letter;30 and second, because this is the very last letter from Ivins to Sachs that would discuss drawings. Only a few years later Sachs would start selling his print collection in order to facilitate what would become his dominat- ing passion, the acquisition of drawings, and yet Ivins never mentioned anything but prints, and especially prints in books, in every subsequent letter, right through his last one in 1955. Had Sachs early on sensed that the basis of his taste and the objects of his affections, and those of his friend, were so different that in his oral response in 1916 he put an end to any discussion of drawings? In light of many of the other 'likes' of Ivins that I shall cite, however, this long letter, written before he had become a print curator, is central because of its stress on the mental essence of great artistic creation, an essence that found its outlet in symbol rather than in narrative or argument or virtuosity. Yet, paradoxically, for Ivins the ultimate symbol was the empathetic rep- resentation of the human as animal, in particular our unique bipedal stance. Two printmakers were the subject of Ivins's most impassioned letters to Sachs. He never forgot 'the wild excitement of the day when as a lad of twenty . . . [he] found Goya's Disasters of War'.31 For Ivins, Goya has 'a certain morad quality that no other maker of prints ever had'. That sounds trite enough, but let me continue quoting Ivins to Sachs at length on Goya for a fuller exposition of the basis for Ivins's judgement: [Goya's] men and women are, with the single excep- tion of the figures in the Poliamolo Battle, the only ones ever made on copper who have their feet firm- ly planted on mother earth, more than planted, they grip it . . . The primitives of Germany had it not, nei- ther did D√ºrer or Mantegna - Rembrandt perhaps, but surely not often - Whistler never knew feet or avoirdupois . . . There are no others who have dealt with the human animal, save Legros and Zorn, one of whom was an academician the other a tremen- dously clever C[harles] D [ana] Gibson. The only person ever to realize this was Daumier, and even there the 'footline' was not of over great importance (fig. 18).32 The matter of stance was peculiarly important to Ivins, and his pejorative description of early Germans as 'splayfooted' has already been mentioned. For his inaugural presentations in the print room, to Sachs he contrasted what they would not be - 'No learning, no scholarship, no flubdub of aestheticism' - with an invo- cation of upright stance (adding a parenthetical vul- garism to lighten his earnestness): 'to stand up (i.e. with 30. Sachs to Ivins, 2 July 1927. This letter was written just after the opening of the 'new' Fogg Museum, which Sachs had done so much to build. He confessed to Ivins that his 'real and inherited capacity ... is for Administration ... I fear I love too well the world of action . . .'. 31.

It took a big man and a strong one to see it and to be unabashed and unafraid. The others all [double underline] failed at the crucial moment and took to traceries, or dreams, smearings of blank copper with smudges of ink, or weaving of fairy tales. Landscape, architecture, graceful models, fine portraits, all - all fade before the presentment of the human animal . . . This is the reason for the predominant greatness of the Florentines - they too walked up to the most inscrutable thing in existence, the beast in man, and looked it firmly in the eye, realized that it existed and had bone and muscle and 'tactile values'.35 In other words, it was the human and not the aes- thetic values that weighed in most heavily with Ivins. This is confirmed by another letter in the context of Goya, responding to criticisms of a Goya exhibition that he had organized for the Grolier Club. In the let- ter he explicitly opposes his humanistic stance, which he called his 'anthropomorphic point of view', to formalism, which, ironically, he - the intellectual - described as 'intellectualis≈•, and also to taste, which he defined here as simply idiosyncratic and thus not a philosophical position: Personally I have never been able wholly to accept the intellectualist, non-ethical, point of view, so ably represented by [Denman] Ross [Sach's colleague at Harvard, a painter who taught design and was a great connoisseur of Asian art] . . . |T|t appears to me as though one must, logically at least, either be a humanist or a diagrammist ... to let one's personal preferences or idiosyncrasies of taste override the relative importance of the two categories can only involve one in a hopeless mesh of dilettantism, in which eventually the only stable, perpetually present element in our valuation will be the fundamental importance of momentary whim. To that quicksand I prefer Peter the rock, the human aspect and the acuteness with which it is set forth.36 Quicksand, of course, is where one cannot find a secure stance. There is no doubt, however, that Ivins 'liked' Goya as well as admired and analysed him. His estate included Goya's Caprichos , Disasters and Tauromachia, , in 'extremely fine', 'very fine' and 'superb' impressions, respectively, according to the auction sale catalogue.37 You will recall that Ivins described another artist's figures who were 'made on copper' and who had 'their feet firmly planted on mother earth': the naked men of Poliamolo. Pollaiuolo was the other printmaker who at one point bulked large in Ivins's correspondence with Sachs, because of a collecting contretemps that, although it began as early as the 1930s, was not resolved, or at least laid to rest, until the publication in 1973 of Evelyn Ehrlich's research on the Pollaiuolo that Sachs had sold to Lessing Rosenwald in 1938 for $25,ooo.38 At the time this was an immense sum for a print, but in 1938 that particular impression of the Battle of Naked Men was the most famous one in the world, having been reproduced as the standard by Arthur Hind in his definitive catalogue of early Italian engraving. In 1939 the print was sent by Rosenwald back to Cambridge for remounting, to the Fogg, where its former owner was now Associate Director of the museum and where Ehrlich, the museum's paper con- servator, discovered that it was in fact a late, heavily restored and reworked impression. The denouement of this discovery was so prolonged and bitter that Agnes Mongan would finally declare to Rosenwald's lawyer, 'If I were of a superstitious nature, I would say that it [the engraving] had a curse upon it.'39 In the course of the affair, Sachs asked Ehrlich to visit Ivins in New York; she brought with her the pho- tographic evidence for her opinion. Ivins reported back on both the Gott/Sachs/Rosenwald Pollaiuolo impression and one he had purchased from the Earl of Pembroke /Wilton House sale in a letter to Sachs that bears on his taste for early Italian engraving more largely. Even here, however, Ivins's 'likes' got bound up with his arguments. The basic issue was his capacity to separate impression condition from impression quality, a capacity that Sachs may have lacked.

Yet in 1 941, with regard to the Poliamolo that he had acquired for the Metropolitan, Ivins said that: For years and years I have been plagued by both good friends and unfriendly critics on the score that our impression was a bad one and that it was a vast pity we did not have as fine a one as a certain other [underlined and annotated 'RJ.S.' in Sachs's hand]. It has always been the particular thing that was cited in support of an all too frequent charge that my per- ception of quality was not what it should be and that I have loaded the collection with poor impressions. Again and again that certain other one has been rubbed into me by knowing print men. I always knew that ours was damaged - torn creases and rubbed spots and weak here and there and that it had slipped in going through the press. It came to us in several loose pieces but I have never been willing to have it repaired beyond the mere fastening of it together and have refused all the strong hints that I should have its face lifted. Also I always knew that it was an extremely early and fine impression in spite of its sad condition. [Here he referred to his close inspection of the Sachs impression some twenty years earlier.] Since then I have always known that ours was the better and the earlier of the two ... all the world was against me, 'speci√°ly [sic] after the high praise that was given the other by a well known cataloguer [annotated by Sachs: 'Hind'] . In fact my first intimation that the cataloguer was not also a connoisseur came from what he said about the other print . . . Within the last several years I have had to discuss the question of quality with . . . dealers who have asked me whether I didn't think some of their wares were fine impressions and who were surprized [sic] and hurt when I said I didn't . . . [T]he trade . . . confounds 'quality' with 'condition' - and what is worse mixes its clients all up in the matter ... we . . . must remember that all the talk about quality outside a very few very limited circles is just so much bosh, sales arguments - and means nothing. Most of the people who talk most about quality can't recog- nize it.41 Sachs could only respond defensively: It is crystal clear that not only your impression, but a whole series of others, are earlier and better than mine, even though we have in my repaired, restored and re-worked copy 'a picture' that would have pleased a good many people from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century - as it does me, even now.42 Here I interpolate another exchange from the Sachs/Ivins correspondence apropos of the two men's valuation of quality of impression. The first letter is from Sachs's assistant, who was forwarding a list of Sachs's sixteenth-century German prints for a prospec- tive loan to the Metropolitan Museum: I believe all the impressions are fine [but] I have not delayed [to check the impressions] because I believe that your attitude in regard to this matter is much the same as Mr. Sachs', that is, that you think the question of quality of impression is a good deal over- done in regard to material of this sort nowadays.43 Ivins responded to her that 'Mr. Sachs and I do seem to think that these are prints which are designs and not examples of the printer's craft - but I doubt if it makes us loved',44 referring, presumably, to 'love' denied by their collecting brethren. But Sachs himself wrote to Ivins a few years later: '[N]o matter what you and I may say theoretically about "quality"' - thus implying many previous conservations - 'we should both be queer collectors and particularly strange Museum men if impressions of the finest quality failed to move us'.45 There are enough references to other early Italian engravings in Ivins's letters to Sachs to let us know that his pleasure in his own museum's Poliamolo was not merely a front for competition with his professional peers. In 192 1, having just acquired the Junius Morgan D√ºrer collection, he told his friend that the damaged but lush Paul Davidson impression of Mantegna's Risen Christ between Saint Andrew and Saint Longinus . . . [is] to my way of thinking quite the most desirable single item in the way of an engraving that has entered the Print Room as yet - and as much as I loathe to say it a more wonderful work of art than any of the D√ºrers.46 Perhaps one can infer here an analogy to the plea- sure Ivins took in Elizabethan poetry, in 'the English that was written by those fellows in the springtime of their awakening to the glorious fact that English was a beautiful thing'.47 Probably he loved early Italian prints for much the same reasons: they were done in a fresh 40. Ivins to Sachs, 24 July 1919, after a buying trip to Europe. Ivins also reported that 'For myself I went broke on books . . . But best of all a series of ideas for articles' - a fair statement of his priori- ties. 41. Ivins to Sachs, 18 April 1941. 42. Sachs to Ivins, 28 April 1941.

Ivins owned one Mantegna himself. Theodore Sizer remembered that: 'His 'Entombment' by Mantegna, which he believed to be one of the finest graphic expressions of the Italian Renaissance, and his great, coarse woodcuts after Titian, delighted him.'48 Ivins could even yearn after lesser Italian masters. Here is his estimate of Robetta's Allegory of the Power of Love , which Sachs had purchased for himself at the Brayton Ives sale in 1915. Ivins found the engraving in some ways the most curiously and hauntingly beautiful print in the whole collection - certainly the one that I . . . should have taken . . . frankly the work of a minor man, [it] had a certain other quality that to me was very wonderful -just strange enough and artificial enough and clumsy enough done to emphasize the very real poetry of it - as though the man had had a vision.49 This is Ivins at his most appealing: when he senses the human qualities both in the art and in the artist. It is implied in his passing remark that the one other print he would have had from the Brayton Ives sale if he could have afforded it was Rembrandt's Christ Carried to the Tomb. This unexpected tenderness comes through again and again in Ivins 's personal letters. It really seems that the ferocious intellect and theorizing antag- onist, justifiably called behind his back 'Ivins the Terrible' and 'Poison Ivy', should in the context of per- sonal taste be characterized by intense humanism and sentiment. To conclude with two examples, first there is Ivins's advice late in life to Theodore Sizer, who had retired as a museum man and art history professor and was con- sidering taking up painting. Apparently Sizer had asked Ivins for suggestions about what to paint; Ivins recommended 'interiors': if you want something to let you all out, drawing, color, values, &amp;c &amp;c, throw in a musical instrument or two - say a cello or violin, even a black grand piano - a good oriental rug, that stays on the floor - a bit of Chinese or Japanese textile on a retreating wall - a bunch of flowers in a silver bowl - a glazed cabinet with some old glass and crockery in it - you know, all the cultural fixings. This was a repertoire straight out of the American Aesthetic School painter Thomas Dewing. But then Ivins went on to describe sheer visual sensation in the intimate details - a crumpled red cigarette package on a mahogany table, knitting in the corner of a sofa - 'the loved quality of beloved things', which by their signs of use and wear would imply the flesh and gestures of persons one loves.50 Finally, there is Ivins's last letter to Sachs, written from a somewhat embittered retirement in Woodstock, Connecticut. Ivins had spent an evening with a German refugee, 'a poor little rabbit of a D.P.', who was not sufficiendy logical, intellectually, philosophi- cally and politically speaking, for Ivins: [S]uch a mischmasch of ideas I've rarely met . . . Years ago I'd simply have dismissed him from my thought, but today I find my mind returning to him again and again and always with wonder. What are values? Can any one of us think straight? Even, can any of us think? Sometimes it seems as though suf- fering were the one thing that humanity have in common - but then I go to the A &amp; P [grocery store] and watch the little children and their young moth- ers and I know that that's not the answer.31 Ivins referred here to thinking, not 'liking'. But his thoughts are equivalent to those he had expressed to Sachs 40 years earlier: [T]he greatest prints are those which deal with humanity ... [T]he great fundamental things with- out which greatest art cannot be accomplished [are] will power or vitality, and an abiding deep interest in the human animal . . . [LJandscape and architec- ture, clothes and manners, after all are things which man inhabits, carelessly and without material result on his bodily frame . . . [I] t is only those things that force a man to conclusions that count in the long run in his psychology . . . His real antagonists are men and their ideas, their dreams, the things that inhabit and inform him, not the things that he inhabits and informs.52 As usual, Ivins was thinking of antagonists, but he admitted to dreams as well as ideas. That these con- structs of the human mind and soul, rather than the eye or hand, informed his 'likes' allow us finally a definition of his taste in prints. Not unreasonably, he understood the expression of these moral qualities through physi- cal representation, through body language, through stance, which became his metaphor for human values, which were for Ivins the basis of worth. 47.
