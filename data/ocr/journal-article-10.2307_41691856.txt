LXI 1980 PARTS I-IV ANÀDITVA OR BEGÏNNINGLESSNESS IN INDIAN PHILOSOPHY BY FERNANDO TOLA &amp; CARMEN DRAGONETTI One of the most important theories of Indian philosophy, in the Hindu as well as in the Buddhist area, is without any doubt the theory that many entities, processes, facts, phenomena have not had a temporal beginning. It seems to us that, although the anãditva theory is referred to frequently by the authors who write about the different subjects of Indian philosophy, it has not been properly stressed on the great importance that the anãditva theory has in the philosophical and religious thought of India, not only because of its constant presence in the various systems, in which that thought manifests itself, but also because of the primordial function which that theory has in the solution of many theoretical difficulties of those systems. Besides that, all the cases, to which this theory is applied, have not been related among themselves. We indicate in this article some cases to which the anãditva theory is applied and some texts which refer to it. Of course, many other cases and many other texts could be added; they would only corroborate the impor- tance that this theory possesses. As it will be seen by the following exposition, not only the Supreme Principle1 is conceived by many philosophical schools of India as a beginning- } Sometimes the Supreme Principle is conceived as an impersonal, neutral, indefinable Absolute, sometimes as a personal Being.</page><page sequence="2">2 Annals BORI , LA7 ( 1980 ) less entity, but also the empirical reality ( samsãra ) in its totality and in many of its manifestations. It happens so that the Supreme Principle and the empirical reality are opposed as two entities without temporal beginning, which are different fundamentally by the fact that the Supreme Principle can- not be abolished, whilst the empirical reality can be abolished. I Brahman and ãtman i The Upanisads 2 give a definitive form in Indian thought to the thesis that we can call substantialist as they postulate the existence of two entities, Brahman and ãtman , who exist in se et per se, without any element in them of relativity or conditionality, eternal, inalterable, whose essence is being, consciousness and happiness. Buddhism will oppose to this substantialist position, a radically relativist and conditionalist position : there are only dharmas? factors or elements of all what exists, insubstantial, conditioned, impermanent and painful, but there is not either a soul or a Supreme God. Among the epithets attributed by the Upanisads to Brahman and ãtman sometimes we find the adjective anãdi . Cf. Kãthaka III, 15; MaitrîV. 1; Svetãsvatara IV, 4; Amrtabindu 9. See also Bhagavad-Gitã X, 3; XI, 19, XIII, 12 and 31, which speaks of the beginninglessness of the supreme and imperishable ãtman . More frequent is the use of the epithet aja , which we can consider as equivalent to anãdi , though with some anthropomorphic shade. Cf. BThad- ãranyaka IV, 4, 20, 22 and 24; Kãthaka II, 18; Maitrï II, 4, VI, 17, VII, 1 ; Mundaka II, 1, 2; Úvetãêvatara I, 9, II, 15. See also Bhagavad-Gitã II, 21, IV, 6, VII, 25, X, 3 and 13 etc. We do not take into consideration the adjective nitya attributed many times by the Upanisads to Brahman and ãtman , because it is probable that in these texts it is employed with the meaning of " constant ", * permanent that is to say, it refers only to a permanency or eternity in the future, without 2 Gods in Rg. Veda have been born at a determined moment, that means that they have had a beginning in time. See A. A. Macdonell, The Vedic Mythology , Vara- nasi 1963 ( Indological Book House ), pp. 11-14. Nevertheless in some hymns ( I, 67, 5-6; I, 164, 6; VIII, 41, 10; X, 82, 6 ) we find the conception of a being who is depri- ved of birth ( aja ), that is to say without temporal beginning, endowed with an exalted hierarchical position and creator's functions. 3 See F. Tola and C.

Such is the meaning that nitya has in Rgvedic Sanskrit4 and in Pali.5 The philosophical schools, which come forth in our era, several centuries after the constitution of the Upanisads in the form in which we have them now, and which accept the existence of Brahman and ãtman, maintain for both the characteristic of beginninglessness. They utilize for both, although not frequently, the adjectives anãdi and aja. Cf. Atmasvarüpa, Prabodhapari- šodhiní, p. 31 ( anãdi ); Bhartrhari, Vãkyapadíya I, 1 ( anãdi ); Gaudapäda, Ägama.iästra I, 16, III, 19, 33, 47, IV, 95, 100 and Prakãáãnanda Sarasvatï Svãmi, Mitãksarã and Šaňkara, Bhãsya ad locum ( aja ); Šaňkara, Viveka- cüdamani 464 ( anãdi ), 512 ( ãdyantahina ); Šaňkara, Upadešasahasrl II, IO, 1-3 (aja), 7 ( anãdi ); Surešvara, Brhadãranyakopanisadbhãsyavãrtika , Sambandhavãrtika 1 ( aja ). More frequency has, in the commentaries and treatises of these schools, the adjective nitya in relation to Brahman and ãtman. In these schools the word nitya has without any doubt the value of ' eternal ', with reference so much to the past as to the future.8 And it is with this meaning that it is applied to Brahman and ãtman. Cf. Bãdarãyana, Vedäntasütra II, 3, 17 (16) and 18 (17) and Annambhatta, Brahmasütravrtti, Mitãksarã, Braja Nãth Bhatta, Brahmasütravrtti, Marícikã, Nimbãrka, Vedãntapãrijãtasaurabha and árinivãsa, Vedãntakaustubha, Rãmãnuja, Srí bhãsya, Vedãntasãra and Vedãntadipa ( only at the second sütra ), Rãmãnanda Sarasvati, Vedãnta- dar&amp;ana, Šaňkara, Bhãsya, Šaňkarananda, Brãhmasutradí pikã, Vãcaspati Miára, Bhãmatí ad locum ; Gautama, Nyäyasütra III ( 1 ), 19-27 ( anãdinidha- naprakarana); Nãrãyana, Mãnameyodaya, p. 197, paragraph 95; Sadãnanda, Vedãntasãra, p. 29; Sarvajñatma, SamksepaSãríraka I, 173, Šaňkara, Ätma- bodha 34, Bhãsya of the Vedäntasütra adi, 1, 4, p. 42, ad II, 1, 14, p. 403; árinivãsadãsa, Yatindramatadipikã, p. 70, cf. p. 83, lines 9-11 ( infinitude of livara regarding time, space etc. ). Among these authors, Rãmõnuja, Vedãntadipa, expresses that the thesis which attributes a birth to ãtman is exposed, among others, to the following absurd consequences : obtainment by the ãtman of what has not been done ( akrtãbhyãgama ) by him and partiality ( vaisamya ) and cruelty 4 See H. Grassman, Wörterbuch zum Rig Veda, Wiesbaden 1955 ( Otto Harrasso- witz ), sub voce. 6 See The Pali Text Society's Pali-English Dictionary , sub voce. 6 This is evident from many of the texts we «.quote in this and the following sections. See in special form Annambhatta, Brahmasütravrtti, Mitãksarã ad II, 3, 17 ( nityatvãn notpattisambhava ityarthah ) ; Dharmarãja Adhvarïndra, Vedãnta- paribhãsã , p. 85 ( vedo na nityah, utpattimattvãt ) ( ed. 1971, The Adyar Library and Research Centre ) ; Harivrsabha, Vrtti to I, 23 of Bhartrhari's Vãkyapadíya , p. 5 8.</page><page sequence="4">4 Annals BORI, LXI ( 1980 ) ( nairghrnya) of the Creator. The idea expressed by Rãmãnuja is the following- one : if ãtman be created in some moment by God, the happinesses and sufferings, which he would happen to experience in the human condition in which he may be born, would not have antecedents or causes, which could explain and justify them ; they would be gratuitous happinesses and sufferings and, as all the ãtmans thus created would not receive the same and identical amount of happinesses and sufferings, but each one would have a different fate, good or bad, this fact would mean an unequal treatment by God, would mean an injustice committed by Him; and the sufferings experienced by the ãtmans thus created would be a capricious manifestation of cruelty by God, because those sufferings are not the consequence of actions done before by the ãtmans and deserving such a punishment. This same thought is deve- loped not only by Rãmãnuja but also by other authors when they comment sütras IT, 1, 34-36 of Bãdarãyana. See the section referring to samsãra in this same article. Purusa and prakrti : The Sãmkhya system is clearly dualistic. It maintains the existence of two autonomous and opposed principles, purusa ( or purusas ) and prakrti . Both have absolutely different natures : prakrti is the first cause, purusa is neither cause nor effect; prakrti is active, purusa is inactive; prakrti is un- conscious, purusa is conscious; prakrti is in constant mutation, purusa is immutable; prakrti is the object of knowledge, purusa is the jsubect of know- ledge. Purusa incarnated in an individual, comes into contact with the material world through the mind, which is also a product of prakrti . This one produces the material empirical reality through an evolutive process. Purusa and prakrti , as well as Brahman and ãtman are beginningless entities. Cf. Bhagavad-Gítã XUI, 19 and Madhusûdana Sarasvatî, Vyãkhyã , and Rãmãnuja, Bhãsya , ad locum ; Išvarakrsna, Sãmkhyakãrikã 3 and Gaudapãda, Bhãsya, Vãcaspati Mišra, Tattvakaumudl , and Yuktidípikã, ad locum ; Kapila, Sãmkhyasutra I, 67 and Aniruddha, Vrtti, and Vijñánabhiksu, Bhãsya , ad locum . Besides these texts the fact that association of purusa with prakrti, to which we shall refer later on, is also without a beginning, compels us to the conclusion that both are also beginningless. II Samsãra : The belief in the reincarnations {samsãra)1 has existed in many primitive societies or in the first periods of their cultural evolution. In the * See F. Tola and C. Dragonetti, " Samsara , anaditva and nirvana " which is going to be published in Boletín de la Asociación Española de Orientalistas Año XIV, 1979.</page><page sequence="5">TOLA &amp; DRAGONETTI : Ànadìtva in Indian Philosophy 5 Rg Veda , the most ancient text of India, this belief in reincarnations does not appear. So we can think that the Indo-Europeans or Aryans who invaded India about 1500 B.C. did not bring with themselves this belief and that they borrowed it from the aboriginal peoples of India. Anyhow, we find this belief firmly established in the Brãhmanas and in the Upanisads and incor- porated into the moral area. The reincarnations have become the instrument for moral retribution of the human actions : the man who behaves well, will be reborn in good conditions, the man who behaves mischievously, in bad ones. Since then the belief in reincarnations belongs not only to the religious doctrines, but also to all the philosophical, Buddhist or Hinduist, systems which begin to appear in India in the Vlth century B.C. - depurated of course from its more coarse elements and provided with arguments which try to prove the existence of transmigration. Besides that it is postulated that the series of reincarnations, through which every man has passed, has had no temporal beginning, is eternal a parte ante. The importance of this belief thus conceived is of first order in Indian thought. The religious, moral or philosophical systems are built on the basis of this belief, in the same way as, in other cultures, they are built on the basis of the belief in an immortal soul or in God. The word ' samsara ', which originally means the reincarnations' series, designates also, enlarging its meaning, the empirical reality. This new meaning is perfectly valid, because the empirical reality manifests itself not under the form of existence, but under the form of re-existences. Therefrom the samsara'' s anãditva is the basis or condition of the anãditva of the entities 9 processes etc., to which we shall refer in the next sections, because those entities, processes etc. are mere manifestations of samsara. We have said that ãtman is eternal and inalterable, and that his essence is being, consciousness and happiness, in their utmost degree of purity. But ãtman , by causes, to which we shall refer afterwards, can appear enchained to the reincarnations' cycle ( samsara ), condemned to transmigrate, submitted consequently to error and suffering. It is what can be called the samsãric or empirical condition of the ãtman . The series of reincarnations, which ãtman has suffered in the past, has been eternal, has not had a temporal beginning. And it would be eternal in the future, if one does not adopt the salvation's methods which Hinduism offers to its adepts and which are the only able to put an end to it. This possi- bility attenuates the pessimist vision which Hinduism has of human condition. About the samsara's anãditva in Hinduisim cf.

Bãdarãyana II, 1, 34-36 and the above quoted authors who comment him utilize the principle that samsãra has had no beginning to absolve the Creator from all accusation of partiality and cruelty. This accusation is based, on one side, in the fact that the world presents, among the beings who live in it, so many differences in relation to the happiness and the suffering which fall to each one's lot, and on the other side, based in the fact of the annihilation of all beings in each of the periodical destructions which befall to the world according to Indian thought. The Creator cannot be accused either of partiality or of cruelty, because, in each of the periodical creations which He performs, each being receives the destiny which he deserves according to the good or bad actions which he carried out in his previous lives - ■ that is to say : which he deserves according to his karman . It is not possible to argue that the beings, that were born in the first creation, did not have karman , because, according to Indian thought, there was not a first creation; there has been an infinite number of creations that have been following one another in an eternal process without beginning; and also because, since samsãra is equally eternal and without beginning, there was never a moment in which any being could find himself without karman , without actions performed in previous lives with deferred good or bad consequences to be realized in new existences. Each time that God created or, better to say, re-created the world, he did it according to the karman of the beings that were to be reborn in that world in order to receive the reward or the punishment they deserved. The world thus created once and again was not the best possible world, but the only possible world under the inflexi- ble karmic causality. Thus the theory of a samsãra without beginning gave the solution to the eternal problem of evil in the world. Among these authors Šaňkara and Annambhatta ( ad II, 1, 36 ) explain that there cannot be a body without karman ( because the body is born as 4 deferred effect of the actiQns carried out in a previous life ) and that there</page><page sequence="7">TOLA &amp; DRAtìONETTl : Anãditva in Indian Philosophy Í is no karman without a body ( because without a body there cannot be actions which, accoding to their moral nature, require new reincarnations in which the deserved rewards or punishments will be received ). We should have the logical defect of itaretarãsraya, if we accept that the samsära has had a beginning, because if the samsara began with a body, this would suppose a karman and if it began with a karman , this would suppose a body. But this defect does not present itself, if we accept that the samsara had no temporal beginning by application of the norm called " the seed and the sprout " ( bijãnkura ). According to this norm one cannot ask whether the seed or the sprout was first, because the alternative relation which unites them ( one is born from the other and vice versa ) has had no temporal beginning. So the questions about the first cause and about when and how was produced the first manifestation of the karman or the body are eliminated, because they are irrelevant questions. Cf. in Šankara, Upadešasahasri II, 1, 3-4, the description of a similar cyclic mechanism : actions-body-pleasure and pain- attraction and aversion-actions-merit and demerit-body. The characterization of purusa according to Sãmkhya , that we have given previously, offers his essential and authentic nature, but as ãtman can manifest himself enchained to the empirical reality ( samsara ), in the same manner, by causes which we shall indicate afterwards, purusa can appear enchained to prakrti and, consequently, obliged to transmigrate, under the sway of error and suffering, in the samsãric or empirical sphere. This condition of purusa has had no beginning. Since a beginningless eternity purusa has always been enchained to prakfti. Cf. for the beginning- lessness of this relation between purusa and prakfti Kapila, Sãmkhyasutra III, 62, VI, 67-69 and Aniruddha, Vrtti and VijSãnabhiksu, Bhãsya , ad locum; Mallisena, Syãdvãdamanjari , p. 99, lines 17-20; Rãmãnuja, Bhãsya of the Bhagavad-Gítã XIII, 19; Šaňkara, Bhãsya of the Vedäntasütra aniel , 1, 5, p. 69.8 Buddhism does not accept, as we have already said, the existence of an individual soul, the ãtman. For Buddhism man is only an aggregate of insubstantial and impermanent dharmas , a series of consciousnesses which follow one another in a constant and swift flowing; it does not exist behind the dharmas , as a nucleus which agglutinates them, any eternal and inalterable principle. But nevertheless Buddhism emphatically affirms that the reincar- 8 We understand the word 4 nityanumeya ' employed by Saňkara in the sense of : " inferable as eternal ", " regarding which it is possible to infer that it is eternal. "</page><page sequence="8">8 Annals BORI , LXI ( 1980 ) nations exist. Buddhism presents us the paradox of a transmigration without a transmigrator.9 As Hinduism, Buddhism affirms also that the reincarnations' cycle ( samsara ) has had no beginning, but one can put an end to it by means of the salvific doctrines and practices which it affords. Cf. regarding the anãditva of samsara in Buddhism10 Buddhaghosa, Atthasãlini , p. 10 (§ 25) ( = pp. 10-11 ed. P. T. S. ), p. 177 ( § 471 ) ( = p. 216 ed. P. T. S. ), p. 191 (§515) (= p. 235 ed. P. T.

See also Nãgãrjuna, Mulamadhyamakakãrikãs XI, 1 and 8 and Candrakïrti, Prasannapadã ad locum . The Pratityasamutpãda : The Prati tyasamutpãda is one of the fundamental theories of Buddhism in the different epochs of its history, but this term has not always expressed the same conception. The word ' pratityasamutpãda 9 signified originally a lineal series of twelve members, each of which is cause or condition of the following one. These twelve members are avidyã , samskãra , vij nana, nämarüpa , sadãy ataña , sparša, vedanã, trsnã , upadána, bhava , jãti , jarãmarana . This series tried only to explain how birth, death and suffering are produced. Afterwards the pratityasamutpãda experiences a profound transforma- tion. It is represented as a wheel divided in twelve segments, which corres- pond to each of the twelve members mentioned before. The pratityasamut- pãda in its new formulation continues explaining, through the causal conca- tenation of its members, the origin of birth, death and suffering. Developing the wheel's image, under which the pratityasamutpãda is now represented, Buddhist masters teach now also that the prati tyasamutpãda , as any wheel, turns round, and this turning round is the symbol of the reincarnations which conform human existence, following one another ( samsãra ). 9 Cf. our article " Samsara anaditva and nirvana . " i° We have been unable to find in the oldest Upanisads references to the samsara* s anaditva. So it is possible to think that the idea of the samsara' s beginningless- ness is of Buddhist origin.</page><page sequence="9">TOLA &amp; DRAGONETTI : Anãditva in Indian Philosophy 9 According to the Hindu as well as Buddhist belief that the samsara has had no beginning, they teach also that the pratityasamutpãda^ wheel has turned round since a beginningless eternity and will go on turning round as long as it is not stopped through the help of Buddhist teachings. The pratityasamutpãda has transformed itself from a simple explanation of the production of birth etc. into a symbol of human existence. Now the pratitya- samutpãda is also designated by another word which expresses clearly the new conception : ' bhavacakra ' Pratityasamutpãda and bhavacakra are now synonyms of samsara. About the beginninglessness of the pratityasamutpãda and the constant turning round of the bhavacakra cf. Buddhaghosa, Visuddhi - magga, p. 494 ( § 273 ), p. 495 ( § 280 ), p. 496 ( § 288 ) and p. 498 ( § 298 ); Milindapañha, pp. 50-52; SãlistambasTitra , p. 83 ( anãdikãlapravrtto , tib. thog.ma . med . pahi dus nas zugspa); Vasubandhu, Abhidharmakosa III, 19, pp. 434-435. III Adhyãsa, ãropa or samãropa : Adhyãsa ( ãropa , samãropa ), literally : " superimposition is a basic notion in the philosophical school of the Advaita Vedãnta. It is an erroneous act of the mind, which grasps an object under a form different from that which it really is, perceives that object as another one, attributes to it a nature and qualities which it does not possess. The example given by the treatises of the school is well known : we see in the darkness a rope and we think it is a serpent. The serpent has been superimposed on the rope. The mechanism is the same in the methaphysical level : ãtman - consciousness, supreme happiness, free from time, space and causality, eternally liberated - is grasped under a form which is not his own one, as an empirical entity, as the physical and psychological ego, dominated by nescience and suffering limited, enchained to the reincarnations' cycle ; the empirical ego has been taken for ãtman ; the nature and the qualities of the empirical ego have been attributed to ãtman ; the empirical ego has been superimposed on ãtman . As a consequence of the adhyãsa men think that they are their empirical ego, composed by the body and the mental and emotional life ; they identify themselves with that ego and perform actions which are inspired by that false conception and which, as a consequence, maintain them enchained to the reincarnations' cycle. The adhyãsa can take place also regarding Brahman , who is perceived under a form different from that which he truly is, as a personal god, as the world; the image of something that Brahman is not has been superimposed on him. The adhyãsa is a congenital activity of the mind 9 an essential characteristic of man, an inevitable sequel of human condition. 2 [ Ann als , BORI J</page><page sequence="10">10 Annals BORI , LXI ( 1980 ) The aclhyãsa has had no beginning ; it has existed in all the infinite reincarnations of the past and it will exist in the reincarnations of the future till the definitive liberation takes place. Cf. Akhandãnanda Muni, Tatua - dipana , p. 52; Madhusüdana Sarasvatî, Siddhãntabindu , p. 41 ; Padmapãda, Parlcapãdikã , pp. 159-160; and Ätmasvarüpa, Prabodhaparišodhini , p. 27; Prakašatman, Paucapãdikãvivarana pp. 61-62 and Citsukhãcãrya, Tãtparya - dípikã , p. 61 and Nrsimhašrama, Bhãvaprakãsikã , p. 61 ; Rãmãnanda Sarasvatî, Vivaranopanyãsa , p. 11 ; Šankara, Bhasya of the Vedäntasütra , p. 18; Vãcaspati Mišra, Bhãmatí, p. 17; Vidyãranya, Vivaranaprameyasam - graha , pp. 43-44. Each adhyãsa leaves in the individual some latent impressions ( sams - k ara ), which actualize themselves and provoke new adhyãsas, which at their turn produce new impressions and so on in an alternating process which has had no beginning. Cf. Nrsimhašrama, Bhãvaprakãáikã, p. 61; Rãmãnanda Sarasvatî, Vivaranopanyãsa , p. 11, Vidyãranya, Vivaranaprameyasamgraha , pp. 43-44. See also Madhusùdana Sarasvatî, Siddhãntabindu , p. 41. Vãcaspati Mišra, p. 17, and Vidyãranya, pp. 43-44, think that, in order that an adhyãsa be produced, it is necessary that the idea or representa- tion {prati ti) of what is to be superimposed exists previously in the mind; and that, in order that the idea or representation of what is to be superimposed exist in the mind, it is necessary that an adhyãsa has been previously produced. If we apply this reasoning to ãtman and the empirical ego, we must understand that, in order that the empirical ego be superimposed on ãtman , it is necessary that the idea or representation of the empirical ego exists previously in the mind; and that, in order that the idea or representation of the empirical ego exist in the mind it is necessary that an adhyãsa has been previously produced, because, if there has not been previously an adhyãsa , we should have only ãtman in his absolute oneness, without anything different from him, and the idea or representation of the empirical ego could not exist. Vãcaspati Mišra and Vidyãranya express that this reasoning cannot be accused of incurring in the logical defect of parasparãiraya , because the process that unites the idea of the empirical ego, which is superimposed, and the adhãsya on ãtman , which is the^support for that superimposition, has been beginningless - as happens in the case of the seed and the sprout, as Vãcaspati Mišra comments. Prakašatman, pp. 61-62, expresses that the superimposition on ãtman of the condition of enjoyer or experiencer depends on the superimposition of the agent's condition, because the person who does not act cannot have [the condition of enjoyer ; that the superimposition on ãtman of the agent's condition depends on the superimposition on him of the union with desire and hate, because a person who js free from desire and hate cannot</page><page sequence="11">Tola &amp; DRAGONETTI : Anaditva in Indian Philosophy 11 have the agent's condition ; that the union with desire and hate depends on the enjoyer's condition, because desire and hate cannot appear in relation to anything which has not been experienced or enjoyed or which cannot be so. Prakãããtman affirms that we have here a succession of causes ( hetuparam- parã ) which is beginningless, similar to the case of the seed and the sprout Cf. Vidyãranya, p. 43. The adhyãsa is the form under which the avidyã, to which we shall refer now, manifests itself.11 Avidyã , mithyãjnãna, mãyã, aviveka : In Šaňkara, avidyã, mithyã jnãna and mãyã can be considered as syno- nyms.12 From the philosophical point of view, they signify essentially the same thing : the ignorance of Brahman or ãtman, the erroneous knowledge of their true being, the act of perceiving them falsely, not as they really are. As we have already said, the avidyã expresses itself fundamentally through the adhyãsa, through the mental process which superimposes on them some-- thing that they are not. When the adhyãsa is not produced regarding Brahman or ãtman, both are perceived as they truly are and, therefore, there is no avidyã or it comes to its end. The effects of avidyã are many. Among them it is necessary to mention specially ãtman'' s samsãra. Cf. Šaňkara, Bhãsya of the Vedãntãsútra I, 1, 1, p. 25, 1, 1, 4, p. 51 and p. 60, I, 2, 11, p. 162, II, 3, 50, p. 613; Šaňkara, Upadešasuhasrí I, 2, 110; Surešvara, Brhadãranyakopanisadbhãsyavãrtika, Sambandhavãrtika, 17, p. 13, 1087, p. 336. The Vedãnta thinks that the avidyã, which enchains ãtman and does not allow him to see the true reality, has had no beginning. On this point see Ätmasvarupa, Prabodhaparišodhiní, p. 27; Gaudapãda, Ãgamaéãstra 1, 16 and Šaňkara, Bhãsya ad locum-, Madhusüdana Sarasvat!, Advaitasiddhi, p. 544, Siddhãntabinbu, p. 18; Šaňkara, Àtmabodha 14 ( anãdyavidyã ); šaňkara, Svãtmaprakãéikã 33; Surešvara, Taittiriyopanisadbhãsyavãrtika 11 Sometimes it is thought that adhyãsa is caused by avidyã . See Padmapãda, Pancapãdikã , pp. 29-30 ; Saâkara, Bhãsya of the Vedãntasutra, p. 12 ; avivekena . . . mithyãjnãnanimittah ... lokavyavahãrah ; Vãcaspati Mis'ra, Bhã - matt, p. 16 : mithyãjriãnam adhyãsah tannimittah ; Vidyãranya, Vivaranapra - meyas am gr aha, p. 48. But Saâkara, Bhãsya of the Vedãntasutra, p. 14, expres- ses that in the pandits * opinion adhyãsa is avidyã . Cf. Saàkara Upadesasãhasrl 1,2,51. 12 Some authors, who come after Sankara and belong to his school, establish several distinctions between avidyã and mãyã , attribute special functions to each other and are inclined to transform mãyã into an autonomous entity, similar to an evil's principle , which endangers the non-duality affirmed by the school and whose rela- tion with Brahman proposes theoretical difficulties.</page><page sequence="12">1 2 Annals BORI , LXI ( 1980 ) I, 49, p. 76 ; Surešvara, Brhadãranyakopanisadbhãsyavãrtika , Sambandhavã - 1091, p. 337; Vidyãranya, Vivar anaprameyasamgr aha , p. 48. We have said before that for the Sãmkhya system purusa is united, enchained to prakrti since a beginningless eternity. The cause, which pro- duced this union or enchainment, according to the Sämkhyasütra I, 55 and VI, 68 and Vijnãnabhiksu, Sãmkhyapravacanabhãsya ad locum , is aviveka , which consists in not differentiating what purusa is from what prakrti is. This concept is very similar to the avidyã. Aviveka , as avidyã , has had no temporal beginning. Cf. Kapila, Sämkhyasütra VI, 12, 68 and Aniruddha, Vrt ti and Vijñanabhiksu, Bhäsya ad locum. For Buddhism, avidyã , which, as the first element of the prati ty a- samutpäda, produces the eternal turning round of the bhavacakra , is also beginningless. See Aňguttara Nikãya V, p. 113; Buddhaghosa, Visuddhi- magga, p. 447 (§37); Milindapañha , p.51, lines 32-33; Nettipakaranay pp. 86, 109, 112. Cf. also Ratnakirti, Sthirasiddhidüsana , p. 127, line 25, If it is asked why, how and when, ãtman, pure etc. fell under the avidya's sway, was pushed into the samsãric condition and was enchained to the transmigrations' cycle - or why, how and when purusa , pure etc. was subjugated by the aviveka9 united to prakrti and dragged along the reincarna- tions - or why, how and when the bhavacakra began to turn round - the anãditva of avidyã and aviveka allows us to discard these questions as irre- levant. It is absurd to ask why, how and when started a process which has had no beginning, which has always existed, as it would be an absurdity to ask why, how and when was born God or the ãtman or purusa or prakrti which did not have a temporal beginning. IV The Veda : Excepting some schools, as those of the materialists and Buddhists, who deny the supernatural origin and value and the eternity of the Vedic texts, the philosophical and religious schools of India agree in the fact that those texts possess a supernatural character because of their origin, because of their unshakable validity as absolute norm of truth, and because of the eternity that in some way or other is attributed to them. For the old Mimãmsã , the Veda is eternal, has always existed, has had no initial moment and will last for ever. It has not been created by some being, either god or man ( apauruseya ). It has been transmitted from £ge to age, from teachers to disciples, in a continuous and not interrupted</page><page sequence="13">TOLA &amp; DRAGONETTI : Anãditva in Indian Philosophy 13 tradition which comes from an eternity without beginning and will last for an eternity without end, in a world that has always existed and will exist for ever. The Veda is inalterable, always the same in its absolute and total per- fection, without error, confusion, contradiction or fraud. It constitutes the only and exclusive criterion of truth. In relation to the Veda's eternity in the Mimãmsã see Apadeva, Mimãmsãnyãyaprakãsa , pp. 7-8 with the commen- tary of Vasudev Shastri Abhyankar ; Jaimini, Mimämsäsütra 1,1,27-32 and Bhãsya of Šabara ad locum ; Kumãrila, Mímãmsã&amp;lokavãrtika , Vãkyãdhikarana , verses 365-369 and Vedanityatãdhikarana ; Laugãksi Bhãskara, Arthasamgraha, p. 15; Nãrãyana, Mãnameyodaya , p. 107, para- graph 17; Mãdhava, Sarvadaršanašamgraha , pp. 119-123; Mallisena, Syãdvãdamarijari , pp. 69-70 ; Pãrthasãrathi Miára, Sãstradipikã ( Tarkapãda) eighth Adhikarana especially pp. 468-470 ; Šaňkara, Sarvasiddhãnta - samgraha , pp. 32-33, strophes 15-23. See also the exposition and criticism of the thesis of the Veda's eternity and the arguments for the opposite doctrine in Bhãsarvajna, Nyãyasãra, 2nd part, pp. 7-16 and Aparãrkadeva, Nyãyamuktãvali, pp. 8-16; Jayanta Bhatta, NyãyamafijarU PP- 213-220. The Advaita Vedãnta agrees with the Mimãmsã in the fact that the Veda is eternal13 and beginningless and has not been created by any being, but affirms that the world's creations have followed and will follow one another in a continuous succession without beginning and without end. At the first moment of each creation the Veda is remembered by God or by some god. There is not any difference among the successive manifestations of the Veda. The Veda remains in a latent and potential state between a creation and the following one. The Veda is the model or archetype according to which the creator realizes his demiurgic work, because the Veda indicates in a more or less explicit form, which are the social structures, the moral norms, the gods, the rites etc. which must exist in the world to be created. The Veda at the beginning of each creation is revealed by the Supreme Principle, God or some god to the first rsis and then is transmitted from teachers to disciples in an uninterrupted tradition. The relation between the Veda thus conceived and God presents difficult problems regarding God's autonomy, independence and omnipotence, to which each school gives differ rent answers and to which we cannot refer now. In relation to the Veda's 13 Nevertheless Dharmarâja Adhvarïndra, Vedãnta pa ribha sã , pp. 85-88 ( quoted edi- tion ), though a Vedãntist author, expresses that in his opinion the Veda is not eter- nal and has had a temporal beginning, because it has been created by God, but he adds that God creates the Veda , at the beginning of cacli creation, exactly identical to the Veda of the former creations. According to ÍDharmarãja. the pauruseyatva consists in having as contents formulations independent from other formulations of the same nature.</page><page sequence="14">14 Annals BORI, LXI ( 1980 ) eternity in the Advaita Vedãnta see Ãnandãnubhava, Nyãyaratnadipãvali, pp. 13-33 ; Padmapãda, Pancapãdikã, p. 315 ; Prakãáãtman, Paficapãdikã- vivarana, pp. 677-692 ; Šaňkara, Bhãsya of the Vedäntasütra ad I, 3, 28, p. 259, ad I, 3, 29, adii , 1, 11, p. 390; árínivãsadãsa, Yatïndramatadipikâ, p. 25 ; Vãcaspati Mišra, Bhãmati ad I, 1, 3, p. 99, ad I, 3, 29-30; Vidyä- ranya, Vivaranaprameyasamgraha, pp. 715-733, specially p. 729. Commenting Vedäntasütra II, 2, 38, Šankara, referring to some schools14 which, in opposition to his own, sustain that the Veda has been created by an omniscient being, expresses that, for these schools, God's omniscience is established by means of the Veda ( because the knowledge regarding God's nature can only be obtained through the Veda ) and that the Veda's authority derives from its author's omniscience, and so they incur in the logical defect of itaretarãsraya. Cf. Jayanta Bhatta, Nyayamañjari, p. 215 ( the last two verses ) ; Aparãrkadeva, Nyãyamuktãvalf II, p. 14, lines 17-19 ; Vidyãranya, Vivaranaprameyasamgraha, p. 719, lines 9-10 ; Prakãáãtman, Pancapãdikãvivarana, pp. 678-679, lines 22-2. Vãcaspati Miára, Bhãmati, commenting also Vedäntasütra II, 2, 38 in fine, declares that this logical defect does not exist in the Vedãnta school, which affirms that both, the Lord and the Veda, are beginningless, although - he observes - the Lord is the origin of the Veda. The Veda's eternity and, as a consequence of it, its absolute and inalterable identity through the infinite creations, its independence and auto- nomy are the guarantee of the absolute character of the moral laws that find their expression in the Veda : good has been always good in itself, bad has been always bad in itself and not as the product of the decision of some omniscient and omnipotent being : the moral law has in itself its fundament and justification. Cf. Jayanta Bhatta, Nyâyamanjarï, p. 188, line 22; Vãcaspati Mišra, Bhãmati adi, 1, 3, p. 99, ad I, 3, 50 infine, p. 336. The word and its relation with the object it designates : One of the most discussed themes in the philosophical schools of India was the eternity or non-eternity of the word and of the relation between the word and the object it indicates.15 If some of these schools, as the Nyãya and Vaišesika, sustain that the word is not eternal, for other ones, like the Mimãmsã and the Advaita Vedãnta, the word is eternal, has always existed and has not been created by any being, and, moreover, the relation that 14 Samkara is referring specially to the SUmkhya, ( theist ) Yoga, Šaiva and Vaisesika schools mentioned in his commentary of the previous sutra. The Nyãya postula- ted also the existence of an omniscient author for the Veda. is This point is treated in general together with the word s eternity.</page><page sequence="15">TOLA &amp; DRAGONETTI : Anãditva in Indian Philosophy 15 unites the word with the object is also eternal, non-conventional, not decided by any person. The eternity of the word and of its relation with the object was for these schools the5 fundament of the Vedď s eternity. In fact, it is impossible to affirm that the Veda, an aggregate of words arranged in a certain way, is eternal, if we do not admit first that these words are eternal; and, in order that th fVeda does not become an aggregate of sounds without meaning or with variable meaning ( which would endanger its archetypal function and the moral law's immutability ) it is equally necessary that the word's relation with the object be eternal and immutable. When we consider these speculations about the word, we must think that they understand that it represents an universal concept and not an individual object. In this way these speculations get in Indian philosophy the same hierarchy that has in Western philosophy the realism and nominalism problem. About the eternity of the word and of its relation with the object it designates see Bhartrhari, Vãkyapadíya I, 23 and Harivrsabha, Vrtti ad locum specially pp. 56 and 58 and III, 29; Ãnandãnubhava, Nyâyaratnadípã- vali, pp. 13-15, 17-25, and 26-27; Jaimini, Pürvamlmämsäsütra 1,1, 5-23 and Šabarasvamin, Bhãsya ad locum ; Kumãrila, Mimãmsãálokavãrtika , Šabdanityatadhikarana ; Mãdhava, Sarvadaršanasamgraha , p. 121, line 20, p. 123, line 11; Pärthasärathi Mišra, Sãstradípikã , ( Tarkapäda ), pp. 379-430 ; Šankara, Bhãsya of Bàdarayana's VedãntasUtra I, 3, 28 ; Vidyä- ranya, Vivaranaprameyasamgraha , p. 724.

V The experience of diversity : The primitive and Hínayãna Buddhism adopted a naive realistic posi- tion : dharmas , the factors or elements of existence, are real, although they are unsubstantial and impermanent ; the world, produced by the union of these dharmas , is also real and our senses and our reason can give us a true and exact knowledge of the world. Mahãyãna Buddhism, in general, and specially its two principal schools, the Mãdhyamika and the Yogãcãra, adop- ted an idealistic and critical position : the dharmas and the world are unreal, illusory, mere creations of the human mind, conditioned by the mind's peculiar form of being, and our senses and our reason cannot give us a valid knowledge of the world. Besides these common postulates, both schools</page><page sequence="16">16 Annals BORI , LXl ( 1980 ) present fundamental differences : the Mãdhyamika considers that conscious- ness participates of unreality, of the illusory nature of everything, whilst the Yogãcãra affirms the real and ultimate existence of consciousness. The latter school conceives consciousness under two forms, aspects or states : in its absolute form - pure, limpid, without contents, one and alone ; and in its empirical state - divided into the illusory duality of a knowing illusory subject and of an illusory world, opposed to him as the knowledge's object ; this world is characterized by the plurality and variety, which of course are also illusory. One of the objections adduced frequently against the Yogãcãras by the Hinduist authors, who criticize and contradict them, refers to the duality and the plurality and variety : consciousness, they affirm, cannot create the illusion of a knowing subject and of a plural and diversified world, if it has not had before the experience of the duality of the knowing subject and of multiple world, because any one who imagines something illusory must have had previously the experience of the illusory thing or of the elements that constitute it. Cf. Mãdhava, Sarvadaršanasamgraha , p. 121, line 12; Sthiramati, Tîkâ , p. 15, lines 16-17; Vasubandhu ad Vimšatika 16. These authors think that they establish in this way the real and true existence of knowledge, its subject and its object. See the following Hinduist authors among others, for the indicated criticism : Aniruddha, Vrtti of Sãmkhyasutra ad I, 42 ; Jayanta Bhatta, Nyãyamaiíjarí II, p. 112, line 28 -p. 114, line 10, cf. p. 106, lines 6-11 ; Kumârila, Mímãmsãslokavãríika, Nirãlambana vãda , verses 178-201 and Sünyaväda, verses 15-17 and Pãrthasãrathi Mišra, commentary of the quoted passage of section Sünyavada ; Mãdhava, Sarvadaršanasamgraha , pp. 14-15; Šaókara, Bhãsya of the Vedäntasütra ad II, 2, 28, p. 499. The Yogãcãras answered the objection by means of the vãsanãs ' and anaditva* s theories. According to the vãsanãs ' theory each act leaves in the mind a sign, an impression, a mark, which in certain conditions is reactuali- zed giving birth to a new similar act. The illusion, the imagination of the subject-object duality and of the multiplicity and variety of the world are due to the reactualization of the vãsanãs left by previous acts, which consisted in the perception by the mind of the illusion ( created by the same mind ) of a subject-object duality and of the multiplicity and variety. And at their turn, the acts which originated the vãsanãs which are actually reactualized, are due to the vãsanãs left by other previous acts, and so on successively in an alter- nating backwards process, experience-vãsúwã-experience-vã.saAíã etc., which has no temporal beginning.

We hope that the quoted texts and the annotations we have done are sufficient to show the importance of the anãditva theory in Indian thought. We think that the anãditva is a most necessary postulate in the great majority of the Indian philosophical systems ; it allows giving a rational answer to many of the difficulties that present themselves in these systems. If together with the anãditva theory we think that for Indian thought the number of universes, scattered in an unlimited space, is infinite, then we can affirm that one of the most characteristic features of Indian culture is its desire of infinitude.
