<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER 21 Fluid and Flexible: Revisiting the Vernacular Tradition on Bronze Age Crete, Thera, and Cyprus by Louise A. Hitchcock Studies of nonpalatial Minoan villas and houses as well as Cypriot ver- nacular and elite domestic architecture demonstrate a tendency to arrange rooms radially around a central room that served as the circulation hub.1 This central room also frequently served as the main gathering area of the structure and could be used for work, rest, socializing, and ritual.2 Various names given to this type of ground plan include "pi- shaped" and "tripartite" for Cyprus,3 and "square-within-a-square,'M "square room with a column,"5 and "vernacular hall" for Crete. Whitelaw's ongoing study of the settlement at Myrtos Phoumou Koryphi on Crete (Fig. 21.1) places the architecture there within this vernacular category, which also includes House A from Neolithic Knossos, thus extending this tradition from the Neolithic through the Neopalatial period.6 Hershenson has reinforced observations regard- ing the stability of the Cretan tradition, extending it to multihousehold complexes at Gournia and Trypiti, while concluding that the large central hall served as a multifunctional focal room.7 This paper contributes further observations about particular examples of this architectural type by drawing attention to the occurrence and cultural significance of the form beyond Crete on both Thera and Cyprus, and by discussing how this module could be incorporated into larger buildings on Crete. Examples from Cyprus show that this plan occurs there as early as the Middle Cypriot (MC) period and continues through the Late Cypriot (LC) IIC period. 1.

HITCHCOCK О 1 2 3 4m Ч 1 1 1 h This architectural design will be referred to here alternately as the SWAS (square-within-a-square) or "vernacular hall" plan. It is clear that the actual structures employing the SWAS plan exhibit as much variability as our names for them. This variability is exhibited through differences in construction details, decoration, circulation (as achieved through variation in the placement of doorways), use, artifact distribution, and contextual relationships with and within other structures. Yet, the continued incor- poration of a central circulation hub and the absence of corridors remains a basic similarity that distinguishes them from features typically associated with more complex, elite structures. The absence of corridors is particu- larly significant, because corridors enhance privacy by allowing agents to bypass rooms while circulating about a building, rather than depending on rooms to facilitate movement. Corridors are an important characteristic of monumental or "palatial" buildings on Crete and to a lesser extent on Cyprus, as at Kalavassos-Ayios Dimitrios, Building X.8 EXAMPLES OF VARIABILITY Michailidou has documented 39 examples of the "vernacular hall" form on Thera and on Crete, including examples from Palaikastro, Ayioi Theo- doroi,Tou Vrachnou o Lakkos, Zakros, Malia, and Gournia, as well as the house model from Archanes.9 Hershenson has focused on its appearance in settlements, as at Gournia and Trypiti.10 In highlighting its plan and circulatory arrangement, Michailidou has shown that the Archanes model is Figure 21.1.

In instances where the central room was left open, it might still serve as both a gathering and circulatory area. At Tou Vrachnou, the smaller rooms do not communicate with each other, but in another example investigated by Preziosi at the MM III structure at Rousses in East Crete near Chondros Viannou, three out of four rooms were interconnected. Despite the differ- ences in circulation pattern, in both buildings the rooms were laid out as mirror images of one another.13 Differences in function characterize both structures, and the finds indicate that the Rousses structure served as a ritual building.14 Thus, the SWAS formed a basic template that could be modified and embellished to suit local needs. THE SQUARE- WITHIN- A- SQUARE AS A MODULE Earlier work illustrated - but did not elaborate on - how the basic "ver- nacular hall" or SWAS form was used as a module that could be modified through augmentation or subdivided to result in the more complicated forms found in Neopalatial "villas."15 A module is defined here as a basic and repeated design element used in the composition of a larger structure.16 11.

A Such elaboration occurs in the House of the Frescoes at Knossos (Fig. 21.3), where the central hub is divided by a partition wall; at House Да at Malia (Fig. 21.4), where a "lustral basin" was added to the central hub, the side chambers made larger, and pier-and-door partitions took the place of walls; and at Tylissos A (Fig. 21.5), where this core element has been subdivided to create a Minoan pier-and-door partition hall and its side chambers.17 Undoubtedly, a thorough analysis of Neopalatial elite buildings could docu- ment more examples of such augmentation, and as we shall see, this form could also be incorporated modularly into larger structures. Rooms 43-45 and 47 in the Workshop Unit of the south wing (Fig. 21.6) of the Palace at Kato Zakros demonstrate that the S WAS plan could also be used as a module within a larger court-centered build- ing.

LOOKING BEYOND CRETE Thera The plan of the West House at Akrotiri, Thera (Figs. 21.8, 21.9), both conforms to the SWAS or "vernacular hall" tradition and provides new information about the use of this plan through the extraordinary level of its preservation.21 At first glance, the size (ca. 150 m2), absence of ashlar 19.

O'Neill, after Coleman et al. 1996, fig. 14 Cyprus The SWAS plan has also been documented on Cyprus from at least the Middle Bronze Age (MBA) until the end of the Late Bronze Age (LBA), long after it ceased to be used on Crete. For example, Asian has called attention to a series of MBA row houses from Alambra, which she sug- gests influenced LC IIC prestige architecture of the 13th century b.c. on Cyprus.26 She also observes that the interiors of the domestic structures at Alambra had small rooms subdivided from the main space, reaching the most developed form in House 3 (Fig. 21.10), where the rooms were arranged radially around a central space.27 As at Tou Vrachnou on Crete, this central space is thought to have served as a partially roofed court, and, in fact, cavities in the court show evidence of burning.28 House 3s slightly more complex plan is also unusual for having a corridor off the entrance (as opposed to the entrance opening directly into a hall or vestibule), while cooking pots, other ware types, and stone tools indicate that it functioned as a dwelling. In addition to House 3 at Alambra, Wright has noted that regional variants of the SWAS plan are also found at MBA Kalopsida, and at LBA Kalavassos-Ayios Dimitrios and Pyla-Kokkinokremos.29 Additional LBA examples may be detected at Kourion-Bamboula in the south, possibly at Morphou-Toumba Tou Skourou in the north, and at Maa-Palaiokastro in the west. At Kalopsida, the SWAS pattern appears as a module for the south portion of a large multiroomed house with the large hall-type room again serving as a court. The court showed evidence of burning, while one of the side chambers (room 6) maintained a formal, raised hearth made out of lime concrete. Another side chamber (room 10) may have served as a pantry, perhaps even a work area.30 Areas 100-106 at Kalavassos-Ayios Dimitrios (Fig. 21.11) exemplifies the vernacular tradition in southern Cyprus in the LC IIC period. This suite of rooms, located in the "West Area" of the site, is the most complete of four distinct clusters that exhibit similar plans.31 Area 105-106 contained pithoi, copper slag, and a stone basin, suggesting that it served as an area devoted to industrial activities and/or storage rather than domestic activi- ties.32 In addition, the SWAS pattern may have served as a module in the much larger Building III, where the central hall was subdivided by a spur 26.

This larger building was clearly important, and its rooms were devoted to the processing, storage, and perhaps even the distribution of liquids, as indicated by paved floors, a funnel, a collection of bronze anthropomorphic and zoomorphic weights; a Mycenaean pastoral- style krater and pits containing feasting debris indicate feasting or banqueting activity.33 Additional LBA examples can be found at Kourion-Bamboula in Houses E.I- III (LC IA) and House A VI (LC IIIA; Fig. 21.12).34 Each has a central circulatory area surrounded by smaller rooms on two or three sides. Although the houses were cleaned out and modified over a lengthy period of time, enough pottery and storage vessels were recorded to indicate their do- mestic character. It is also suggested by Weinberg that House В (13th cen- tury b.c.) at Morphou-Toumba Tou Skourou (L. 17.45 x p.W. 10.10 m) may have assumed this form.35 It maybe of special significance that the S WAS plan occurs in structures dating to the end of the Bronze Age on Cyprus at Pyla-Kokkinokremos and Maa-Palaiokastro, because attempts have been made to associate both sites with Aegean "Sea Peoples."36 Out of the four-and-a-half domestic structures excavated at Pyla-Kokkinokremos (dated to the final phase of LC HC, ca. 1230 b.c.), complexes A (Fig. 21.13) and В conform to the SWAS plan,37 and they are comparable in both form and size to McEnroes type 3 Minoan house.38 Complexes С and D appear to be truncated varia- tions of this design and incorporate a "but-and-ben" arrangement consisting of a roughly square space divided into two parts by a spur wall running down the middle, with an opening at one end.39 The finds, which include 33.

However, an east-west corridor bisects what may be the central hall at the north end, the southern end is badly disturbed, and it is not possible to further study the site at this time, as archaeological activity in northern Cyprus is illegal.

It is one of only two buildings on the site that employs ashlar masonry in its con- struction to any extent and it distinctively uses the SWAS plan during the first habitation period (floor II).41 Finds from the building consist of an unremarkable domestic assemblage, including some 10 stone tools, two calcarenite basins, and a small assortment of Cypriot domestic pots and Figure 21.12.

A reconstruction of the routines of the inhabitants through anal- ysis of circulation patterns and artifact distribution may go further in helping us understand the way they perceived their own identities than trying to im- pose an ethnic identity upon the site based on the presence of a proportion of LM IIIB pots, which may be imports (contra Karageorghis 2002, pp. 75-76). Indeed, Karageorghis and Demas's (1984, pp. 50-52) bias is indicated by statements that LM III storage vessels and stirrup jars were "brought to the island by immigrant Cretans," whereas the four Canaanite jars were "imported"; the social significance of the local Cypriot pottery is not considered. 41. The ashlar is believed to be reused. The other building using ashlar masonry is a two-roomed tower just north of Building I that is constructed on the same orientation, as detailed by Demas (1988, pp. 15-16).</page><page sequence="11">VERNACULAR TRADITION ON CRETE, THERA, AND CYPRUS 243 Figure 21.14.

Mycenaean UIC tableware.42 The thick (ca. 1 m) walls suggest an upper story with a staircase in room 23, and its northwest orientation further distinguishes it from other buildings on the site, which are oriented to the northeast. 43 For example, Buildings II and IV are also significantly different from Building I in layout and arrangement. Building II is an axial struc- ture with a rectangular hall, a central doorway in the short side, a central hearth, and a series of side chambers recalling the "megaroid" form found in Postpalatial domestic units on Crete (as known from Kavousi Vronda and Chalasmenos) and in similar structures on the Greek mainland, which are associated with Mycenaean culture.44 Several of the site s large halls with smaller associated rooms, such as Building IV, contained hearths. Thus, the SWAS plan favored for Building I represents a different tradition than that found in the other buildings on the site. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE S QUARE- WITHIN- A- SQUARE PLAN OUTSIDE CRETE In the past, the occurrence of similar types of artifacts in neighboring cul- tures was explained as resulting from cultural diffusion, colonialism, and even a "Versailles" effect.45 In contrast, contemporary research that looks for signs of ethnicity in the archaeological record advocates assigning identity based on the full repertoire of material culture and determining which arti- facts (if any) have become emblematic of cultural boundaries.46 Interpreting the appearance of the SWAS plan in the architecture of island cultures near Crete requires that the circumstances for each case be contextualized. In the case of Akrotiri, Palyvou has shown that the architecture was deliberately modified to give it a more Minoan form, but the execution shows particularities that she regards as local.47 One example of a deviation from Cretan Minoan-style features is seen in the occurrence of pier-and- door partitions without a light- well in the house known as Xeste 3. Signs of Minoan cultural influence are also seen at Akrotiri in decorative details such as figurai frescoes and horns of consecration, which, along with the</page><page sequence="12">244 LOUISE A. HITCHCOCK already mentioned architectural features, are associated with the elite of Minoan society.48 A more nuanced approach to the interpretation of such constructions is to view them as part of a conscious strategy employed to promote prestige through the appropriation and display of the foreign and exotic; they legitimize the authority of those who constructed them.49 For example, the combination of a traditional Minoan-style house plan with various examples of maritime imagery (as in the West House) would have enhanced the prestige of the owner. It is interesting that what we perceive as a vernacular style of architecture became a symbol of prestige for the Bronze Age Therans. Understanding the appearance and continued deployment of the SWAS type of house plan on Cyprus is far more complicated. Although many Aegean features have been identified in Cypriot architecture of the 13th and 12th centuries b.c., the presence of the SWAS plan in vernacu- lar architecture as early as the MBA argues against a specifically Minoan cultural influence.50 Coincidence in the rendering of what maybe a generic form or a cultural inheritance from a common Anatolian origin for the Minoans and Cypriots of the MBA are two alternative explanations for its occurrence on Cyprus. Along with a cultural package of other features associated with an Anatolian origin, such as the reintroduction of cattle and urn burials of children, rectilinear houses first appear on Cyprus in the Early Bronze Age (EBA), marking a distinct change from the round houses of the Chalco- lithic period.51 This change is attributed variously to migration by some, and by others to the conscious adoption of foreign elements by elites, but with general agreement that the new features orchestrate and promote new identities.52 The continuation of the SWAS form at Pyla and at Maa in the 13th century b.c. can be contrasted with the adoption of axial and rectilinear structures indicative of the mainland that also occur at Maa and Postpalatial sites in Crete, but not at Pyla. Demas has also pointed out that the houses at Pyla bear no comparison with those of the Greek mainland, where recti- linear halls are a hallmark of the Mycenaean Greeks.53 The continuity in the appearance of this house form, particularly in the most important building at Maa (as indicated by its prominent position near the city wall, liberal use of ashlar masonry, and distinct orientation), argues against the Mycenaean colonization of these sites as proposed by Karageorghis.54 The migration of small numbers of skilled workers in search of new patronage after the destructions of the Mycenaean palaces may also explain the local produc- tion of small amounts of Mycenaean UIC pottery that appear alongside Cypriot pottery at these sites. In such a scenario, small-scale movements may have resulted in large-scale changes in domestic architecture.55 48. Hitchcock 1998. 49.

The persistence of this form on Cyprus, in particular, is significant because it represents the preference for a local Cypriot building style at the end of the Bronze Age over the rectilinear hall associated with colonization by Mycenaean Greeks. In contrast, the adoption of the SWAS plan at Thera maybe seen as a conscious strategy for promoting elite iden- tities through the adoption of a foreign (i.e., Minoan) architectural style. The "vernacular hall" plan itself has a long history, but it is the decora- tive details, circulation modifications, and local needs that played key roles in determining the function of the structure employing this plan. Therefore, the SWAS plan can be viewed as a modifiable template that could be used to create "one of a kind" houses whose multifiinctionality played a role in shaping the daily routines of the inhabitants on Crete, Thera, and Cyprus.</page></plain_text>
