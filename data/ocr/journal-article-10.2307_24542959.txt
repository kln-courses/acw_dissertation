THIERRY HOQUET1 ABSTRACT This paper focuses on the concept of "animal individuals" and puts forward a nominalistic approach. Nominalism is an ontological thesis (only individuals exist), but also an episte mological claim: that our "nouns" are practical tools for a quick dispatch of things, but do not correspond to anything real. Hence for a consistent nominalist, "animals" do not exist, except as a powerful fiction. First, we show that the word "animal" commits what we call (after Plato) the "fallacy of the crane": it encompasses a huge range of living entities that have only one thing in common: they are not humans. Differences between our term "ani mal" and the ancient Greek "zoon" also show the fluctuating boundaries of "animality." Besides, our ways of speaking systematically deny individuality to nonhuman animals. The philosophical meaning of the term "individual" implies a genuine dimension of artistic singularity and a political claim for emancipation. Portraits of apes are striking instances of such individuality, captured by photography, as is art produced by particular animals. Methodologically, this leads also to the collection of anecdotes and a focus on animal biographies. The eighteenth-century controversy between Buffon and Condillac helps us understand what is at stake in the tension between species and individuals. Buffon claims that each nonhuman animal species can be represented by a "specimen," whereas Condillac shows that animal individuals feel like us and that their nature is impenetrable to us. Finally, a focus on individuals is not only a way to renew or extend historical methods. Biologists are also increasingly concerned with individuals. They develop tools to distin guish individuals from one another: "animal bertillonage" for morphology. They question standard norms of behavior and preferences. This emphasis on animal individuality has not only theoretical but also ethical and legal consequences. Keywords', individuals, biographies, anecdotes, animal portraits, animal art, specimens, nominalism, bertillonage. When invited to think about animals and history, some will refer to dogs, others to cows, a few others to tigers, bears, or crocodiles. At first, this list seems hetero geneous: most of these animals are domestic (pets, cattle) or game; others belong 1. I am grateful to John Zammito for his very stimulating comment during the conference "Do Animals Need a History?": the way he drew my points to an almost caricatural extreme helped me sharpen my arguments and build, I hope, a stronger case for animal individuals. Gary Shaw's friendly and caring "shepherding" has also been very instrumental in the maturing of this paper, alongside the precious and inflexible assistance of Julia Perkins.

But at the same time, there is a striking uniformity among these animals, as most of them are mammals, or at least vertebrates. Few would think that "the history of animals" also refers to spiders, flies, bees, jellyfish, worms, or many other barely visible creatures. Our spontaneous understanding of what "animal" means refers to vertebrates rather than nonvertebrates, and to macro-organisms rather than micro-organisms. So the term "animal" is biased in two different, symmetrical ways: we unite under this term a diversity of living entities; but we also make spontaneous assumptions that the only animals who deserve our attention are more or less "like" us, that is, superior vertebrates, like the notorious "big five game animals" (the lion, the elephant, the Cape buffalo, the leopard, and the rhinoceros) who now establish the fame of African national parks. The "animal" word is very ambiguous: "they" possess a very broad range of shapes, from moths to whales; "they" make sense only insofar as they are related to "us": worms are interesting animals only if they are silkworms; mosquitoes only if they are treated as pests and bacteria as diseases, that is, related to human lives in some way or the other. This seems to create a sharp contrast between historical and biological accounts of animals: a history of animals seems to be necessarily human-centered, whereas a biology of animals (also called zoology) seems to take into account the diversity of animal lives as such. In biology, the fruit fly, the xenopus, or the nematode are model organisms vested with theoretical relevance. In history, by contrast, the sole valuable insight would be concerned with the human use of animals, or the impact animals have on humans. This paper tries to overcome this methodological cleft by using the concept of individuals and putting forward a nominalistic approach. Nominalism relies on an ontology of individuals: for a consistent nominalistic view, the only kind of enti ties that exist are individuals. This entails an epistemological thesis: the idea that our nouns are practical tools for a quick dispatch of things, but that our general terms do not correspond to anything real. Nominalism is a radical philosophical position, especially as it appears to undermine Aristotle's claim that there is sci ence only inasmuch as there is generality. But if a scientific knowledge of the individual is prohibited, what of a history of individuals? J-irst, this paper sets the ground tor a nominahstic stance as it stresses the con ceptual intricacies of the word "animal" and points at drawbacks pertaining to any classification and terminology (part I). Then the paper embraces a nominal istic perspective: it looks for the philosophical or epistemological consequences of taking individuals into account (part II). A focus on an eighteenth-century controversy between the French naturalist Buffon and the philosopher Condillac helps us understand what is at stake in the tension between two different levels: the species and the individual (part III). Finally, the paper suggests that a focus on individuals is not only a matter of interest for renewing historical methods, but that it is also a concern for biologists (part IV). Throughout these four sections, we will ponder whether the term "animal" is relevant or not, and whether we should still use it or rather discard it as fatally flawed. We will try to get a better grasp on what is really assumed when we speak of "animals."</page><page sequence="3">70 THIERRY HOQUET I. OUT OF THE ANIMAL PITFALL? The Animot Most, if not all, Western discourse on "animals" is spoiled by a persistent and all-pervading fallacy, embedded in our use of the word "animal." They are the animals, the brutes, whereas we are different.2 This entanglement of naming and representing "the brutes" was brought to the fore by Jacques Derrida's illuminat ing neologism, his concept of the "animot." "Animot," which sounds in French like the plural form of animal (animaux), is a "mot-valise," a portmanteau des ignating the animal-word.3 It is an ironic neologism that captures the moral and cognitive ambivalence of the word "animal." We use "animal" as a singular to describe a plurality: an immense diversity of living, sentient, and mobile beings. Hence, the animot has a powerful effect in shaping our views of what (or who) animals are, and in determining our practices toward them—always excepting "us" from the general animal rule. "Animal" is indeed a very efficient word that empowers us and allows us the magical trick of both severing us from all other animals and reducing their plural ity to a single noun. It has the political power of coalescing all differences (except the anthropological one). After all, classificatorily speaking, what do the tiger, the whale, the chicken, the blue tit, and the ant have in common? They all are "ani mals." But strikingly, we tend to feel that what concerns animals does not concern us. The word "animal" magically sets us aside, preserving us from any defilement. This is the key argument made by a philosopher with phenomenological leanings, Etienne Bimbenet, in a book called, "L'animal que je ne suis plus" (The Animal I No Longer Am—a pun on Derrida's title).4 While acknowledging that we humans share in some (Darwinian) ways a common origin or descent with other animals, Bimbenet discards all sense of kinship as being now irrelevant to understanding the meaning of human activities. The Darwinian argument may be true, Bimbenet argues, but it does not apply any longer. Following phenomenological lines, Bimbenet tries to understand "what it is like to be a (nonhuman) animal": undeni ably, we have been animals, but no less undeniably, we are no longer animals, as ethology proves that our perceptions, our worlds are different. There seems to be a radical divergence between our ways of being in the world. But Bimbenet's phenomenological interpretation of ethology is just a way of playing again and again the old "animal" trick: his book is a clever but very conventional instance of how the animot shapes our perception of them as apart from us, and of them as conflated under one single category. The animot is an act of denial of our own participation in the "animals": Derrida's neologism power fully designates and encapsulates the magical linguistic trick that we play on all (nonhuman) animals. 2.

I will now compare our under standing of the concept "animal" with the Greek word zoon (plural: zoa). Is zoon a good equivalent to "animal," and potentially, another kind of animot: a political tool to separate "them" from "us," certainly a window on whether animal as we conceive it is almost "natural," almost inevitable? Did the Greeks understand "zoon" as we do "animal"? To understand this, we must determine if the ancient Greeks used the term zoa so as to include "humans" or, on the contrary, in order to systematically separate zoa from humans. What does the word zoon stand for? Francis Wolff argues that the term zoon was invented in order to mark a dif ference from humans: Greeks classically distinguished between humans and ta alla zoa, the other animals.5 Zoa, in this case, designates a collective with fuzzy lines that quite resembles our understanding of what "animals" are. In support of this claim, Wolff and others remind us that the Aristotelian worldview includes a hierarchical chain of being.6 In the Aristotelian universe, telos (purpose, end) plays a central part, entailing a hierarchy of degrees of perfection among ani mals.7 Humans are the highest among earthly creatures; they rise above life in order to reach the divine world.8 It is with this in mind that Aristotle emphasizes the idea according to which animals are somewhat "dwarfed," or "dwarf-like" compared to humans. Being dwarfed insists on the maladjustment of ta alla zoa to the order of the universe; only the human being achieves the full development of its natural telos. Children, like animals, are "dwarfish."9 However, this teleological reading is contradicted by Aristotle himself in other texts: for instance, Aristotle states that zoa include both humans and oxen—sug gesting that the categories zoa and humans overlap.10 Besides, Aristotle attributes to zoa the use of phronesis (prudence).11 Aristotle also seems skeptical about the meaning of the word zoon: in chapter 14 of Metaphysics Z, he denies any exis tence to the zoon "as such."12 Aristotle claims that we seem to understand zoon in the same sense when we speak of a horse and of a human being.13 Thus we understand that the word zoon is a unified logos (an idea with a clear concept). But as a result, zoon designates at times a bipedal entity, and at other times a 5. Francis Wolff, "L'animal et le dieu, deux modèles pour l'homme," in L'Animal dans l'Antiquité, ed.

This flexible use of the term leaves open exactly which of the zoon's characteristics are present in each and every animal.14 This text (the con clusion of chapter 14) is an anti-Platonic argument: for Plato, zoon is an eidos, a form or idea with a separate existence, whereas Aristotle claims that there is no "idea" (eidè) of animal independent or separated from individual animals. In the Aristotelian world, individual animals exist, together with some collections of individuals called "species" (such as "horses," "dolphins," and so on), but no general "animal." Plato himself may support such a nominalistic view of the "animal." In the Statesman (263d), he refers to the fallacy of the crane, which means, stated simply, that, as soon as any group classifies other living beings, they except themselves from the categories they build. It is always we alone against the rest of the animals, as if we do not share anything with them. We classify all beings except ourselves on one side of a Great Divide, and we stand alone on the other side. According to Plato, the crane would probably discriminate and distribute all living beings between cranes and noncranes, ta alla zoa: it would include human beings in the noncranes, and the general category would be labeled beasts (the ria). The crane's fallacy suggests that "animal" is, first and foremost, a political, ethnocentric concept, deprived of any grounds in reality. Besides, there are different texts in which zoa and animals are not exact syn onyms and do not follow the same logic. In Greek, zoa are usually opposed to phyta (plants), thus covering what we usually understand as animals. But plants may be included among zoa, and the world itself may be called a zoonP In other texts, zoa also include gods, which contradicts our usual understanding of what an animal is. Should zoa rather be translated as "animate beings"? The Greeks also used the term "empsucha," which designates entities with a soul, and for which zoa is not a strict equivalent. So what are zoa? They encompass several entities, gifted with sensibility, movement, and reproductive powers. It is clear that the term zoon functions in many ways like our word "animal." But the fact that the two concepts do not exactly match allows a critical outlook on the naturalness of our own category—at which the nominalists raise a skepti cal eyebrow. As we have seen, humans generally consider that they are separate from all other animals ("the brutes"), and they label this class with the word "animal," a catch-all category for all nonhuman, sentient entities. Similarly, the crane, as depicted by Plato, has an irrepressible tendency to set itself apart from all other living beings. But there is no logical rationale for the crane since animals and zoa do not exactly match, suggesting that there are different ways of shaping the category of "others." Is "Animal" Really the Source of Linguistic Abuse? This comparison between animal and zoon suggests a nominalist approach to the subject. However, the ethnocentric abuse of classification cannot suffice to disqualify the human need to classify: after all, can we discard all general terms if 14. Ibid., 1039 b 14. 15. See Plato, Timaeus, 77b and 30cd.</page><page sequence="6">ANIMAL INDIVIDUALS 73 we necessarily think in types and tokens?16 Here, our nominalistic stance should take a radical guise. We have to distinguish between animals in the plural and the animal as a singular. Animals, after all, may be a legitimate concept for naming all living beings that can have sensations. But it should always be kept in mind that, in contrast to the category "furniture," divided into "chairs" or "tables," the category "animal" (the animot) has massive political consequences as it entails a politics of massive killing. The "animal" concept may well be a logical mistake, as it subsumes all animals except us in one category. But it also has more practi cal effects, namely the slaughtering of millions of animal individuals. Whereas "animals" is a classificatory tool, "animal" works as a legal category whose ulti mate meaning is that killing an animal is not murder. Hence we accept the term "animals" as a way to refer to the diversity of sentient beings, which share the power of feeling and of having emotions, desires, goals; but we reject the term "animal" as a way of merging all their differences into one single idea. There are several shortcomings to the concept of "animal": it is an umbrella term, where spiders, snakes, worms, and elephants are included in one category. As a result we don't know what we are talking about when we refer to the "animal"— except that "we" may kill "them." However, this argument may be considered too broad: as, for instance, pets are bred, but not eaten or killed, and they may even be protected by anticruelty laws. It may be the case that more specific categories could be better targets for political goals. After all, if what Derrida was after with his animot was to achieve some sort of "animal liberation," then a focus on other categories like "cattle" might well be more efficient. Our question now: is there any good reason not to discard the "animal" cat egory? After all, there must be other good ways to refer to "animals," if not to "the animal." In 1749, the French naturalist Buffon claimed that all possible criteria fail to distinguish the key difference between animals and plants.17 He ended up forg ing the general category of the "organic," including all plants and animals in one single category: there are no "plants" and no "animals," only "organic" or "living" matter. Buffon was probably too radical on this point, but his personal theoretical agenda gave him good reasons to criticize the animal category: he was on his way to creating biology and for this he needed general concepts that would apply to all living things. Furthermore, it should be remembered that animals (as a plural) is above all a very ordinary concept: a quick way to designate some entities as sentient, and a useful tool for knowledge. One could argue that "animals" can be a useful way to describe a form of life: as opposed to plants or rocks, as when Linnaeus divided "naturalia" natural beings, into three kingdoms: animalia, vegetabilia, minera lia.lg It seems that there are two major intuitions underlying our understanding of "animal": (a) a living being (hence not a mineral) that is not a plant; (b) a living 16. This point was raised by John Zammito in his comment on the first draft of this paper. 17. Buffon, "Comparison of plants and animals" (1749), in Histoire Naturelle générale et parti culière, 36 vols.

If we want to circumvent the fallacy of the crane, and consider that there are human and nonhuman ani mals, we need not discard altogether the "animal" category: we can use it in the plural, criticizing (b) but retaining (a). We may keep the word "animals" (as different from plants) and use it as a subject for new rights and protections. Strik ingly enough, this is what most animal rights supporters do. They ask why human beings are mysteriously excluded from the "animals"—so they reject (b); and they reclaim new rights for "others," "nonhuman animals"—so they endorse (a). Derrida's neologism targets the animal word as a singular, but the plural form may still be useful. There is obviously something potentially wrong with our language, but maybe "animal" should not bear all the burden of guilt on its own. Surely enough, in the long course of history, "animalizing" human beings has been a common path leading to extermination.19 But several other linguistic abuses have been repeatedly noted by philosophers. Issues of language have been a constant concern to supporters of the animal cause, who have measured the impact of naming practices. Feminists like Ruth Herschberger have repeat edly emphasized how the power of naming informs our practices of domination: "The names you uncaged primates give things affect your attitude to them forever after."20 In 1780, Jeremy Bentham stressed the bias of legal terminology: whereas human beings are called persons, nonhuman animals are debased into the class of things?1 By the end of the nineteenth century, vegetarian essayist Henry S. Salt (1851-1939) also noted: Something must here be said on the important subject of nomenclature. It is to be feared that the ill-treatment of animals is largely due—or at any rate the difficulty of amending that treatment is largely increased—by the common use of such terms as "brute-beast," "live-stock," etc., which implicitly deny to the lower races that intelligent individuality which is most undoubtedly possessed by them.22 Arthur Schopenhauer also highlighted the fact that humans use the neuter pro noun "it" to refer to highly organized beings such as the dog and the ape.23 The implication is that we should extend to nonhuman animals the practice of refer ring to them by the pronouns "he/she" (instead of "it") and the possessive adjec tives "his/her" (instead of "its"). Those various linguistic practices point toward the same core: our language is not only wrong by excess of generality, and the term "animal" is not solely responsible for our wrong moral behaviors; our ways of speaking of "them" tacitly involve a massive denial of animal individuality. In order to avoid the animot fal 19. See, for instance, Sven Lindqvist, Exterminate All the Brutes (New York: New Press-Norton, 1996). 20.

Paradoxically, taking animals as a plural may lead us to focus on their individuality. II. THE ANIMAL-AS-INDIVIDUAL ROUTE I want to understand how, and in what measure, the individualistic view advanced by some contemporary thinkers can help us circumvent the shortcomings of the "animot." However, there are several limitations or challenges to making the focus on "animal individuality" a sound way of thinking about animals: First, we have to break a powerful epistemological taboo, because since Aristotle real knowledge of the individual has often been considered impossible. All scientific knowledge necessarily deals with generality. The individual can only be depicted, artistically, but not really or scientifically "known." This epistemological obstacle raises the issue of what science is, what it should seek, and especially, whether history is constrained by the same type of methodological agenda. Second, the idea of ani mal individuality may easily lead to anthropomorphizing nonhuman animals. Is the animal-as-individual route a form of deep anthropomorphism? Third, there is no clear evidence that there is a strong tie between an ontological stance like the individualization of animals and some alleged ethical positions: individualization does not necessarily entail ethical or political generosity toward animals, and it is equally compatible with brutalizing. It could also be claimed that individuality may be merely a spatially and historically situated way of looking at things. I have to answer some of these claims and to stress the practical effective ness of considering animals as individuals, as doing so involves forcing humans to confront their own perceptions of what an animal life is, and how much it's worth. Elisabeth de Fontenay published an article entitled "La bête est sans rai son" (The brute has no reason), which was dedicated to "Leyla, cocker spaniel."24 In contrast to the abstraction of soulless, animal "brutes," Leyla was the embodi ment of an actual dog, one who shares the "domusthe home, one with whom I have a personal, intersubjective relationship, one whom I would never consider deprived of personality or spirit. In a similar fashion, in her Companion Species Manifesto, Donna Haraway doesn't speak of "dogs" in general but of one specific dog: Ms. Cayenne Pepper, with whom she has had a sustained and meaningful kissing relationship, which she playfully labels "oral intercourse." This personal characterization of Ms. Cayenne Pepper contrasts sharply with the anonymous and abstract "dog," which exhibits reflex action in Buffon or salivates at will in Pavlov's experiments. As we can see, for both Haraway and De Fontenay, individualizing is a philo sophical tool used to fight against Cartesianism and the reduction of animals to brutes and of brutes to matter. Interestingly enough, Descartes himself cared for a dog, whom he called "Monsieur Grat."25 Not only did Descartes have a dog, but he called him "Monsieur," like a human person. As Jacques Bouveresse ironically commented: "it would probably never have occurred to him to call his clock 'Madame Une telle,' even if he thought that animals are nothing but clocks, 24. Élisabeth de Fontenay, "La bête est sans raison," Critique 34, no. 375-376 (1978), 707-729. 25. Adrien Baillet, La Vie de Descartes [1691] (New York: Olms, 1972), II, 456.</page><page sequence="9">76 THIERRY HOQUET although much more complex than ordinary clocks."26 Even if Descartes argued so radically for animals as machines, he tacitly acknowledged some "individu alistic" qualities in the dog who shared his daily life. He could not resist calling him "Monsieur." What Is an Individual? The first way to answer the objections raised earlier is to consider that there are several competing definitions of the individual. We don't need to go too far in the analysis of the concept of the individual, but some of the major features of this concept may be underlined. A common claim is that individual derives from the Latin individuus: indivis ible thing. So the crucial experiment of individuality is division: for instance, if you divide a human being in four parts, he/she dies, and each of his/her parts also dies. Thus understood, the individual relates to the category of indivisibles.27 This claim may be supported by the fact that for Cicero, individua corpora is the Latin translation for the Greek atomos, or, in other terms, indivisible.28 The discovery by Abraham Trembley in 1744 that freshwater polyps have the capacity to regenerate, or to multiply when sectioned, was a radical challenge to the idea that animals are individuals, leading Buffon, for instance, to redefine individuals as composed of individuals.29 French philosopher André Lalande (1867-1963) distinguished individuals from indivisibles. He argued that, for instance, although a factory is in some way indivisible, it is not an individual. Even if the different parts resulting from the division of a human being were alive, those parts would not be as many different individuals, Lalande claims. Why is this so? For Lalande, an individual is above all a logical term, designating the genus minimum, the level beyond which no other subdivision is possible. For instance, Greeks can be logically divided into Athenians, Beotians, and so on; Athenians into citizens, slaves, and so on; citizens into Socrates, Plato, Critias, and so on. But Socrates or Plato cannot be divided again. In other words, the individual exists only in relation to a genus and a species, within the framework of logical division. Individuals are a matter of classification and subdivision between elements and classes. Eventually, individuality is tied to haecceity, the fact of being here and there, of being this one that I can point at. In the case of the parts resulting from the division, Lalande claims, the pieces are not the species of a genus: there is no logical division involved, no sense of individuality. So where is true individuality to be found? For Lalande, true individuality is epitomized by the artist. When we refer to the individuality of the artist, we do not mean he/she is indivisible: we refer to a personal, original way of seeing things: Individualism is the affirmation of what one is, in opposition to what one is not, of the self in opposition to the non-self. This is the heart of the idea. This is the tendency that distin 26. Jacques Bouveresse, Descartes et son œuvre aujourd'hui (Sprimont, Belgium: Mardaga, 1998), 119.

Si omnes, ego non [If all, then not me], this is the motto of individualism: freedom for each, is the first claim of its program.30 From Lalande's analysis, we understand, first, that individuality is undeniably a political term: historically situated, in connection with liberalism. As such, it may be an appropriate tool to achieve the political goals of defeating the "animot" fallacy, as it focuses on each singular individual and reclaims "freedom for each." Second, individuality also has a broader philosophical meaning. As a logical term, individuality is not contradictory to generality: individuality denotes the ultimate term of a logical division: it makes sense only in relation to (rather than in oppo sition to) some general concepts. In other terms, focusing on animal individuals is not departing from the Aristotelian dictum that there is only knowledge of the general. Talking of individuals is mostly a change of focus. Finally, individuality is linked to personality. If individuals are not objects, they are also not metaphysi cal persons—endowed with an immortal soul. Personality is best understood with a reference to art. The artist (or, at least, a romantic stereotype of what an artist should be) epitomizes at best the meaning of individuality, giving us a good hint to identify where to look for animal individuals in culture. Disruptive behaviors, misbehavior, or resistance might be good markers for individuality. The Portrait of an Ape The reader of Frans de Waal's Peacemaking is struck by two kinds of illustra tions in the book.31 Some feature different species of apes: chimps (Pan troglo dytes) , bonobos (Pan paniscus), Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatto), stump-tailed macaque (Macaca arctoides). In these pictures, an animal individual stands for his/her species, as if the individual were only a token of a type. In the rest of the book, most of the pictures describe an individual with a personal name: for instance, Tepel jumps over his son to protect him against an attack from Dandy. The fact that these chimps have names conveys the idea that they are individuals, with peculiar behaviors, their own sets of interests and emotions, and distinct personalities. Philosopher of science, photographer, and friend of apes Chris Herzfeld embodies this way of confronting the viewer with animal individuality. In an article that asks what is it like to be face to face with a great ape, Herzfeld pres ents photographic portraits of great apes, like Victoria, a twenty-eight-year-old female gorilla, that Herzfeld met in 1996 at the Antwerp Zoo. Herzfeld maintains that portraits underscore both the individuality and the autonomy of the animal, a tradition of portraiture that dates from the Renaissance.32 Portraits of individual apes are not restricted to high art and museum galleries.

Old bestiaries suggest that animals have funeral rites, and that they grieve for their losses.33 As Vinciane Despret notes: "Photographs awaken stories; as to portraits, they make it into history, or rather, they make one enter into history. Only those who matter are portrayed,—even if they begin to matter only because they have lent themselves to the portraitist's interest."34 Plates with specimens, individuals standing for their group or species, open the wider question of visualization: How can a painting or picture stress the individuality of the individual? Quite the opposite: how can an individual animal be made, through visualization, a specimen, an emblem of its species? A speci men is a lieutenant, an old French word that comes from tenir lieu de, to stand for, to be a substitute. The specimen, as a lieutenant, stands for all its congeners; it is a symbolic organism within the same group. But who are the "congeners"? And what does the individual primate stand for? Following the work of Donna Haraway, let's consider the corpse of the individual gorilla shot in 1921 in the "heart of Africa": he was, Haraway writes, "transfixed into a lesson in civic vir tue in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City."35 This ape does not stand for himself: he stands for his own species. But more than this, he stands for us humans; he stands for a certain form of civilization: the alpha male reigning over his docile mates. As Haraway notes: "in European, American, and Japanese societies, monkeys and apes have been subjected to sustained, culturally specific interrogations of what it means to be 'almost human.'"36 When I see an ape, I don't see an ape as such: I see a representation of the origins of man; I see a cousin, or a "brother"—with a tendency to anthropomorphism that we should probably tame, or caution against. I see a representation of what it means to be "98% human."37 A representation of such animals can never be innocent. With apes, "the bodies and lives of third world animals" serve as "surrogates for man."38 Haraway com ments on a painting by Tom Palmore: Reclining Nude (1976), currently owned by the Philadelphia Museum of Art. At first sight, the gorilla is individualized by the setting and by the fact that the painting is presented as a classical female nude. Here the gorilla portrait underscores the status of the individual: we immediately associate such representations with individuality. But Haraway's comment bears on other features of the canvas: she takes the painting as evidence that "western 33.

In the wake of postcolonial studies, one may ask who's entitled to speak in the name of animals. Indeed, the notion of standpoint has become a powerful tool in the hands of the supporters of the animal cause. To a certain extent this harkens back to Marx, who wrote in the context of an analysis of the concept of "class," in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte: "They cannot represent themselves, they must be represented." This question dovetails with Gayatri Spivak's seminal essay "Can the Subaltern Speak?," where she distinguishes between two meanings of representation: vertreten, as in politics, to speak for somebody else; darstellen, or pictorial re-presentation.40 The indi vidualization or Darstellung of animals taking place in contemporary culture is certainly a political gesture of voicing the subaltern, a step toward Vertretung, an ideological attempt designed to give voices to those who must be represented. An effective way of avoiding the pitfalls of representing (darstellen) has involved a growing interest in art produced by animals41: if animals are artists, then they are individuals since artists embody radical individuality. A Bestiary of Anecdotes In the early modern bestiary, individual animals often stood for their species and each species stood for a definite virtue. Pierre Bayle's seventeenth-century Dictionnaire historique et critique conflated different kinds of animal models illustrating contradictory moral virtues: if we should live under the moral guid ance of animals, which one should we take as a moral example, the coy and pure dove or the profligate sparrow or pigeon?42 But strikingly enough, more than just species symbolizing virtues, the old bes tiaries are replete with anecdotes. Samuel Bochart in his Hierozoicon (II, LVI) presents the case of the dog of the cemetery of the Saints-Innocents, who slept for three years on the tomb of his master.43 The Jesuit Noël Regnault also remarked on the abundance of individual cases recalled by tradition and memory: Every day, we make new observations on animals. Plutarch, Claudius Aelianus, and Pliny have whole volumes stuffed with such cases. In these books, there was a dog so angry that he discovers the man who murdered his master; another dog lets himself die from hunger and grief; and another follows his master onto the pyre into the middle of the flames; another one drinks in the Nile only while running, from fear of being eaten by crocodiles; another dog plays a part in a play on stage, and gets applauded by all spectators. . . ,44 39.

The role and perhaps even ontology of the anecdote has been addressed by Mark Bekoff, whose book, The Emotional Lives of Animals, is dedicated to two animal individuals: Jasper and Pablo. Jasper was an Asiatic black bear who came to the Animals Asia Moon Bear Rescue Centre in Chengdu, China, from a bear farm, where he had been kept in a tiny cage, so the farmer could extract lucrative bile from his gall bladder.45 Pablo, born in 1970, also known as matri cule CH-377, was a chimp who wound up at the Institute for Primate Studies at the University of Oklahoma and was later transferred to the LEMSIP46 in 1981. In ten years at LEMSIP, CH-377 was darted 220 times and had over 30 punch-liver, bone-marrow, and lymph-node biopsies. For Bekoff, such case studies are personal animal life histories. They should not be called "anecdotes," as they are, rather, documents and tools for a philo sophical challenge to the animot. Philosophers, however, often reject reasoning by means of "anecdotes" as suffering from anthropomorphism, or artificially representing animal behaviors as more human than they really are. Nonetheless, anthropomorphism is a compelling way to suggest that the animal is, like us, an individual subject.47 The perspective of writing the lives of animal individuals, famous or anony mous, opens new roads for historical research. Zoographies, like biographies, have been and could be written. Not only the life of Alexander but that of his horse Bucephalus; not only the life of the Duke of Wellington, but that of his horse Copenhagen.48 That would lead to a collection of biographies of great (nonhuman) individuals. Like portraiture, biography is a genre with its own rules. Several writers have been playing with and against the literary conventions of the biographical genre, applying it to animals. Virginia Woolf wrote the biography of a literary dog, Flush, the charming little cocker spaniel who shared the life of the poet Elizabeth Barrett while she was confined to her sickbed. Franz Kafka wrote the autobiography of an ape in his Report for an Academy*9 Of course, not all animals may be susceptible to such a biographical treatment. Our biased understanding of what "animal" means is easily conveyed by the term "animal individuality": "animal individuals" are, almost necessarily, vertebrate macro-organisms with feelings and empathy. When it comes to "mosquitoes" their empire has been described, but not in terms of individuality.50 Let us note, however, that there is also a growing trend toward "biographies of things" or "of 45. http://www.all-creatures.org/articles/ar-beartapping.html (accessed October 8, 2013). 46.

As Erica Fudge makes clear in her contribution to this issue, there is no such thing as "the" cow, there are only indi vidualized cows, personal acquaintances in the household, leading to a kind of micro-history à la Ginzburg.53 Attention to individuals and to the group to which they belong is central in the work of Japanese primatologists, who have stressed the importance of individual behavioral variation in macaques, and the way they originate new "subcultures."54 III. WHAT DOES A PORTRAIT STAND FOR? READING THE BUFFON/CONDILLAC CONTROVERSY The focus on animal individuals is by no means a novelty or an invention of pri matology. In the eighteenth century, artists quite commonly painted the portrait of individual animals. For instance, Alexandre-François Desportes (1661-1742) painted Louis XIV's favorite dogs on decorative wooden panels for the doors and the anterooms of the Castle of Marly. In Jean-Baptiste Oudry's (1686-1755) dog portraits, specific animals are portrayed: Misse, Turlu, Luttine, Lise, or Gredinet. These individualized animals contrast markedly with the engravings in Buffon's Histoire naturelle.55 Although Buffon's Histoire naturelle is related to aristo cratic culture (several animal corpses were bequeathed by their former aristocrat owners to Buffon for the King's Cabinet), the engravings that illustrate his work have a totally different meaning from the artistic renderings of favorite pets. Buf fon denies that animals have a face: he claims that even monkeys, for instance, only have "the mask of a human face."56 The mask is an illusion: it conceals the mental emptiness of apes and monkeys under the guise of individuality. Representing the Species Buffon's Histoire naturelle is richly illustrated. But what do those various animal images stand for? The engravings do not depict animal individuals; they depict specimens, that is, each animal is portrayed as a lieutenant of his/her species as a whole, or at least, of a definite group or type within the species. In Buf fon's plates, only types are depicted: the Ox, the Horse, the Ass. . . . Most of the time, one individual is enough for depicting the whole species. Presentations of 51.

Sometimes subspecies or breeds are isolated and fixed by the engravings: for instance, twenty-one varieties are isolated within the Dog species (the Doguin de Bordeaux, the Icelandic Dog, the Greyhound . . .). In doing so, Buffon is being provocative: he does precisely what Claude Per rault refused to do. In an earlier project supported by the Académie Royale des Sciences, Perrault followed a true Baconian method: he depicted the animal indi viduals one after the other and refused to generalize. A diachronic analysis of the different editions of his Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire naturelle des Animaux (1671 and 1676),57 clearly shows Perrault's resistance to generalization. For instance, the 1671 depiction of the "Coati Mondi" becomes in 1676 "depiction of two coatis." Perrault never goes as far as depicting "the" coati. Buffon, on the contrary, depicts almost all species by a single specimen type. An exception to this is the giraffe, which Buffon considered insufficiently known at the time.58 Another quite striking exception to the "one species, one engraving" rule is the human species. Strikingly enough, Buffon's Histoire naturelle does not include any representation of the human species. What will be presented, throughout the nineteenth century, in the guise of Adam-and-Eve-like pairs, is absent from Buffon's original work. The absence of any specimen shows that Buffon believes that when humans are presented, they are always singularities, with individual names. Individual humans may represent a pathology or mon strosity but are always a singularity. They never stand for a general category called "humans," or even for any natural subgroup of humans that could be called a "race." Buffon depicts several cases of extraordinary humans in the Supple ments: the "white négresse" Geneviève, a female albino named Maria Sabina, whom Buffon examined in May 1777,59 a young girl suffering from vitiligo, and a series of other human monstrosities or anomalies. In the main body of the Histoire naturelle, the human species is not pictured, although Buffon devotes more than a hundred pages to the study of human variet ies. This is a clear sign of Buffon's commitment both to the unity of the human species and to the spirituality of the human soul—hence, the radical individuality of each human being. In fact, in place of a human specimen, Buffon gives only a table, taken from the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, which represents the various passions of the soul.60 On the contrary, whereas an entire nonhuman species is encapsulated in a single individual in Buffon's iconography, he contrasts human individuals and nonhuman animal species. For Buffon, each 57. Claude Perrault, Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire naturelle des Animaux [ 1671 ] (Paris: Impri merie royale, 1676). 58.

Her parents were two black slaves named Martiniano and Padrona. Although the caption on this "piebald girl" clearly indicates two black genitors, the man who sent the portrait to Buffon suggests that she is the offspring of a black woman and a white man, to which Buffon replies (October 13, 1772) that he thinks she actually is a crossbred offspring of a blafarde, or white négresse, and a black nègre. 60.

What Jacques de Sève's engravings capture is also perceptible at the level of behavior. Buffon believes that all animals in one species behave in the same way, what is usually called "instinct." As a result, Buffon must try to account for the unity of behavior among the various individuals of one single species: "if one wanted to attribute a soul to animals, one would have to posit only one soul per species, to which each individual would equally participate, hence, this soul would be necessarily divisible, and therefore, it would be material and very different from ours."61 If animals had a soul, it would be only one soul per spe cies, as they all behave in a similar way. As a result, all animal individuals would have to partake in the one soul of their species, and thus this soul would have to be somewhat divided among them. Such a soul would be totally different from a human soul, which is indivisible. Condillac and the "Nature of Animals" Debate In the mid 1750s, Buffon and the Abbé de Condillac engaged in one of the key debates bearing on the possibility of animal individuality, namely, the question of animal souls. What we analyzed earlier through the Derridean "animot" is framed during the Buffon/Condillac controversy by a constant discussion of the "nature" of animals. In his Traité des animaux, Condillac accuses Buffon's account of animal sensi bility of lacking consistency. He argues that one can detect a tension in Buffon's Histoire naturelle, which combines both an interest in animal intelligence and a materialistic, mechanistic stance. For instance, Buffon praises the intelligence of the elephant, while he depicts animals as soulless machines. For Condillac, how ever, there are only two possible (and consistent) philosophical positions related to the animal question: the continuous scale of Aristotelian faculties (which supports animal sensibility and intelligence in a gradual fashion) or Cartesian dualistic mechanism, which denies both sensibility and intelligence to all animals (except humans). Any mixture of the two (such as Buffon's), he argues, would be doomed to collapse from its inner contradictions. It is striking that Buffon supports contradictory claims about the "nature" of animals. On the one hand, he challenges the common understanding of what "animal" stands for and concludes that the animal/plant dichotomy should be replaced by a broader concept of the organic. But, then, he retains animals as a separate category: Buffon boldly entitles his text "Discourse on the nature of ani mals" (following his "Discourse on the nature of man"). When it comes to human and nonhuman animals, then, Buffon simply negates instead of comparing: by "negation," I mean that Buffon states something positive about humans and then simply denies it to all other animals (for instance: the human soul is indivisible, so animal souls are divisible).62 61. Ibid., II, 441-442. 62.1 analyzed this ambiguity as resulting from two different methods: the "way of comparison" and the "way of negation." See my Buffon: Histoire naturelle et philosophie (Paris: Honoré Cham pion, 2005), 675ff.</page><page sequence="17">84 THIERRY HOQUET In an explicit contrast to Buffon's hubristic program, Condillac explicitly denies the possibility of such grand metaphysical discourses on "natures."63 For Condillac, the term "animal" is just an abstraction, which artificially extracts the common features existing between different notions that we have of various creatures ("dog," "horse," and so on).64 As to animals, Condillac thinks that we simply cannot feel the way they feel: sensations are always a first-person experi ment and subjectivity is not substitutable. Hence, access to "natures" is denied to us. However, a sound assumption is that, if animal individuals feel, they feel like us: there is only one way of feeling. The authors are similarly divided about animal souls: do animals have individ ual souls? Or do they have only one soul per species, the view Buffon advanced but which Condillac rejected? Instead, he tries to explain any resemblance between individual behaviors as an effect of their common set of needs. In his Treatise on Sensations (1754), Condillac imagines the development of an individual sentient being (a statue) by granting it one sense after the other. First the statue is endowed with smell, then with hearing, taste, sight, and then, finally, touch. He supposes that each individual is endowed with the ideas that he/she has received through his/her senses: individuals who lack one sense have fewer ideas or different ones.65 Condillac's statue is also a powerful tool for understanding how different individuals can have similar ideas. Regularities within the human species point to similar perceptions among different individuals and are explained by the connections between perception and bodily organization. Given the fact that several individuals share the same physical configuration, the argument goes, they will probably acquire similar sets of ideas and thus be able to communicate. Condillac's statue is a general theoretical model encompassing all sorts of sen tient beings endowed with various sets of senses. Through the experimental device of the statue, Condillac's understanding of perception and bodily organization extends to nonhuman animals. But unexpectedly, Condillac also is a paradoxical case of a philosopher who affirms both a continuity and a discontinuity between human and nonhuman animals.66 We humans owe all our ideas to our sensations, but although animals share the same senses and feel exactly like us, if not, at times, more acutely than us, they remain different from us and somehow inferior to us. Condillac's text is pervaded with an unjustified sense of human self-importance. For Condillac, "brutes compare, judge, have ideas, and memory," and there fore can't be assimilated to automata.67 But brutes are unable to abstract and are deprived of the capacity of "reflection," which Locke had defined as "that notice which the mind takes of its own operations."68 Humans, on the other hand, 63.

Our soul is not of the same nature as that of the brutes."70 In spite of his defense of animal sensibility, Condillac failed to replace the logic of the animot with a more encompassing view in which there is no strong divide between them and us. He did, however, develop philosophical tools to pluralize our notion of what an animal is, and on the other side, to unite all animals (includ ing us) in a common way of feeling, but he eventually fell back into the animal pit and declared that their nature and ours are by no means the same. IV. THE BIOLOGICAL RELEVANCE OF ANIMAL INDIVIDUALS Part II dealt with the question whether a nominalistic commitment to individual ity leads to the rejection of all general terms. With a focus on the Buffon/Condil lac debate, part III examined the articulation between individuals and species. Do all individuals in one species follow the same morphological/behavioral patterns? Or is there any space left for singularity within the species? Part IV will now answer the (Aristotelian) challenge that a focus on animal individuality would be "unscientific." I now want to show that the idea of animal individuality is not confined to philosophical salons or conferences of postmodern scholars appoint ed to humanities faculties. Similar trends toward an individualistic perspective on nonhuman animals can be identified in recent biology. First, biologists have developed tools to identify individuals. But second, several biologists have recently attempted to challenge the idea of stereotypical animal roles, especially female roles and male roles, and have called for a notion of animal singularity. Animal Bertillonage Researchers on animal behavior and conservationists have developed methods for identifying individual animals in order to "capture" their singularity. In ecol ogy, the purpose is often to give an accurate census of a population; ethologists are concerned with knowing who is who in order to describe the life history of an individual animal or to make inferences about his/her home range. When needed, artificial tagging has always been a practical tool to accomplish both of these tasks. But naturalists have also devised a set of natural marks, a sort of nonhuman equivalent to Alphonse Bertillon's fingerprints and system of identification.71 69.

For instance, he noted that elephants were individualized by different parts of their body: by the shape of their trunks, or by the edge of their ears; zebras by the unique structure of their stripes; sperm whales also have special marks on their fins, and so on. A fifty-seven-page monograph entitled "Marking and Tagging of Aquatic Ani mals" compiles 166 sources describing biological marks of identification (with an emphasis on fish).73 "Methods of Photo-identification for Small Cetaceans" provides a good review on the methods for identifying whales.74 American mam malogist and field naturalist George Schaller identifies gorillas by their nose prints.75 He writes: During our first encounters with gorillas, [a colleague] noted that their noses appeared distinctive, and later I found that the nose was the best single characteristic for recogniz ing individuals. . . . The nasal region between brow and nostril is highly distinctive. Most gorillas have a divided nose bridge separated by a shallow trough. Occasionally only one ridge is present and sometimes there are three.... The trough between the ridges is usually furrowed and wrinkled.76 To the extent that we want to identify animal individuals, it appears that there are many ways to perform what we might call animal bertillonage: the art of dis tinguishing one animal individual from others, by a system of individual markers. Dissolving the Behavioral Patterns A focus on animal individuals can help us overcome some systemic biases in biological research. Philosophers of biology have criticized a tendency to essen tialism in biology:77 species were considered as types, and, in Buffonian fashion, individuals were only instances, standing for (or lieutenants of) their species. On the one hand, the Darwinian standpoint has provided strong incentives to over come this essentialist bias. Darwin's focus on variation rather than on essences or types is a strong argument in favor of rethinking animals as individuals. But on the other hand, Darwin's concept of sexual selection has dramatically changed our views about animal sexuality, leading to the concept of "normal sex roles." These normalized roles do not apply to a species as a whole, but within the species to all individuals belonging to one sex. "Males" and "females" appear to be the relevant categories for analyzing animal behaviors, following two univer 72. D.

This pattern was experi mentally searched for by British geneticist Angus J. Bateman in his 1948 paper on "Intrasexual Selection in Fruit Flies."78 It was later expanded in the works of biologists such as Robert Trivers and Geoff Parker. According to the standard narrative, evolution has produced two different strategies for producing gametes: costly ova and cheap sperm, leading to two different behavioral patterns: coy ness/eagerness. These patterns of behavior would be found in all biological spe cies, from arthropods (insects like drosophila fruit flies) to anthropoids, and espe cially humans. This led science writer Matt Ridley to claim that there was not one "human nature," but two different ones.79 The popular magazine Elle described women as being "hardwired to 'size up' and appreciate male competition."80 The idea of fixed sex-roles, constant in whichever species is considered, was met with a lot of skepticism, especially by feminists.81 Primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy showed that coyness was far from being a universal pattern applying to all female behaviors: consequently, the belief in female coyness has worked as a very pow erful blinder for ethologists in the field.82 In contrast to these views, field studies by Jared Diamond seem to prove that each female may have her own private aesthetic.83 Male bowerbirds of New Guinea and Australia build decorated structures called bowers, which resemble thatched huts and which they display to females. A female chooses the male in whose bower she deposits eggs on the basis of his bower. Because of the con spicuous role for female choice in bowerbird courtship, they have long been used as exemplars of sexual selection. But what Diamond's work demonstrated was that there is no single best bower. The most complex bower is made by males of the Vogelkop Gardener bowerbird, which lives on five remote mountains of Indonesian New Guinea. Bower styles differ among species, among populations of a species, and between individuals of a population. According to Diamond, these differences in bower preference among females arise from intrinsic differ ences among birds rather than local differences in objects available for decorat ing bowers. In the words of Diamond: "individual birds prefer some colors over others, individuals and populations differ in these preferences, certain objects are placed in specific parts of the bower, and birds steal chips from neighbors. Bower style may be partly learned. Hence, geographically varying bower styles may be a culturally transmitted trait, like human art styles."84 The implications of this are actually quite interesting.

Building on Hrdy's and Diamond's field observations, evolutionary biologist Joan Roughgarden has made a general argument against the typical narrative according to which all males are necessarily eager, and all females coy—a cari cature that she calls provocatively "the Darwinian sexual-selection narrative."85 Roughgarden asks whether there is any common pattern between the individual preferences of each female. In other words, is "quality of mates" a shared value? Or does each and every female have her personal opinion on which mate is out standing? Roughgarden claims that females choose, but that they do not choose "good" or even "compatible" genes; they choose cooperation. The question here is the opposition between what I call "group aesthetics" and "private aesthetics." According to "group aesthetics," preferences are not an individual matter, but are a collective feature characteristic of the species as a whole, or rather a feature of all individuals belonging to one definite sex. For instance, if all females really shared conventions, they would all go for the same potential mate, whereas gung-ho males would go for any female until they die from exhaustion, in love or in combat with their potential rivals. In that standard narrative, it is not this female, who has this or that preference, it is all females as a group who should have preference for the same males. Roughgarden wants to replace that framework with the idea that Sally the peahen prefers Fred the pea cock while Betty the peahen prefers Bill the peacock; she develops mathematical models to avoid the assumption that both should go for the same individual. Exactly as evolutionary biologists have rejected group selection, "group aes thetics" should also be discarded and the traditional (Darwinian) narrative should be replaced by the belief that each individual has her/his own particular prefer ence. To summarize, part IV has demonstrated that biologists have developed an interest in animal individuals in their methodology: they have been very keen to look for markers of individuality, be they physical (in terms of bertillonage) or behavioral (in terms of preferences or choice). V. CONCLUSIONS Nominalism is a theoretical ghost that immediately triggers philosophical out cry. However, nominalism may work as a warning or as an incentive to caution ourselves against our own words when they stand for conceptual/intellectual tools. Throughout this paper, I have followed three different threads and exam ined contested concepts/words: the word "animal" has led us to the problem of anthropocentrism, and has revealed our hidden tendency to set ourselves apart from all other living beings, what I called, after Plato, "the fallacy of the crane" (parts I and II); the relation of the individual to the species raised the issue of essentialism, or the "typical" approach to what species are and how an individual may be said to belong to a definite species (part III); the question of unified sex 85. Roughgarden, The Genial Gene, 20.</page><page sequence="22">ANIMAL INDIVIDUALS 89 roles has revealed the presence of gender bias and male chauvinism (part IV). In each of these cases ("animal," "species," "sex"), a nominalistic stance can help us understand that any "one" individual (preferably a male) cannot always be a good enough "lieutenant" or proxy for his/her own group. Even if (or precisely: because) we necessarily think with words, and words are our own tools, we have to be especially cautious about the words we use. Throughout this paper, I have emphasized that variation is not a fluke, but actually something meaningful to which historians and biologists should pay attention. As already mentioned, there are many challenges to the "individual animal" route, but they may be answered. First, it is commonly assumed that there is no knowledge of the individual, and that all science necessarily deals with the universal. But the assumption that "individuals" are contradictory to general concepts is not grounded: in fact, Lalande's analysis shows that individuals exist within a hierarchy of concepts and in relation to broad, general terms. So our nominalism is a moderate one, not a radical one. Besides, what is knowledge? If the animal individual can be depicted, this depiction may be another name for history. If individuality prohibits any "sci entific" (mathematical?) grasp of animals, maybe history is an efficient way to tackle this level of animal reality. As we just showed, even within biology there is a growing tendency to overcome generality and to focus on the individual. Finally, the emphasis on individuality in animals has more than a merely theo retical upshot: it has ethical, political, and legal consequences. Increasingly, we are now asking the question: who counts as a person? Some nonhuman animals are becoming "persons," in the human, moral, and even legal sense. Animals can be provided for in wills by their former "owners" or "masters," or, to respect correct parlance on this matter, "their caregivers." They can receive money and property for their support and are entitled to have their fortune administered by a legal guardian.86 However, a focus on individuality may not be enough to over come the animot. This is clearly shown by a strange and perplexing anecdote:87 the story of Bobby, a dog that Emmanuel Levinas met while he was a prisoner in the camps of Nazi Germany. Bobby showed up at the morning assemblies; then in the evening, he often waited for the prisoners, cheerfully barking and jumping: at a time when the guards were denying the prisoners their human status, Bobby was the only creature on earth that made them feel alive and human. More than that: Bobby is called by Levinas "the last Kantian in Nazi Germany," in other words, Bobby was the only creature who still heard the "categorical imperative" and fulfilled the requirements of moral action. However, in a radical gesture, Levinas intellectually and morally relegated Bobby to the other side of the Great Divide, in the infra-moral world of brutes. No animal has ever been closer than 86.

This last example shows the limits of the animal-individual route as a political argument. If a focus on animal individuality might open new roads for historical (and biological) methodologies, the political efficiency of the nominalistic turn is less evident. It seems that ethical decisions must be made on a level that is independent from ontology. Moral outrage can target many different, and at times contradictory, philosophical stances.
