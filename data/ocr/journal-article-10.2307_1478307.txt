Transcending the Beardsleyans: A Reply to Carroll and Banes In Dance Research Journal (Spring 1997), I defended with qualification Monroe Beardsley's definition of dance against the criticisms of Noel Carroll and Sally Banes (1), partly to protect a conception that comes very close to representing an important hu- man practice of at least the last twenty-four hundred years: creating rhythmical move- ment for the sake of pleasure. In a later issue of DRJ (Spring 1998), Carroll and Banes presented a rebuttal, "Expression, Rhythm, and Dance," with Carroll highlighting him- self the "Monroe C. Beardsley Professor of Art at the University of Wisconsin." In what follows, because of space constraints, I will address almost exclusively their first topic, expression, to show how one might begin countering them. If in 1982 Beardsley ultimately held Carroll and Banes's interpretation that dance 12 Dance Research Journal 31/1 (Spring 1999)</page><page sequence="2">was defined "solely in terms of the super- fluity of expressiveness" (1998, 16), then his theory is so ineffectual that it probably never should have been published in the first place in the form it took. We would have a case of a well-established, experienced aesthetician offering some subtle distinctions such as "actions," "motions," and "movings," and then ignoring them for the sake of a formula that could be very easily overturned-and overturned by a counterexample much more obvious than the one Carroll and Banes of- fered, of a theatrical work called a task dance that ostensibly involved no more than tasks, Rainer's Room Service. Leaving aside the immediate impression that "superfluity of expression" conveys melodrama or an over- wrought style of pantomime more than it does dance, the following counterexample would suffice: a composition of rhythmical, pedestrian movements. This sort of compo- sition need not involve a superfluity of ex- pressiveness in virtue of the pedestrian move- ments, and is something, for instance, that Clive Barnes may have been describing in the New York Times, Feb. 16, 1969, when reviewing pieces by Twyla Tharp: "her pro- gram was very evenly textured, with a mo- notonous lack of much in the way of cre- ative invention" but "there is a definite cho- reographic structure" (Barnes 1969, 20). At any rate, Merce Cunningham, as I pointed out in my previous article (endnote 35), had already laid the groundwork by 1950 for making dances only out of pedestrian move- ments, and even without an example in the history of well-recognized dance to point to, an average student could construct on a moment's notice such a counterexample. One need not cite-nor, as Carroll and Banes have done, spend pages defending as dance-a suspicious and incredibly obscure entity like Room Service, just as one need not employ "hairless fetus" to undercut the definition of human as "blond-haired ratio- nal animal" when a generally accepted in- stance of a human being-say, black-haired actress-would suffice. Consequently, Carroll and Banes's 1982 article was unnec- essarily cumbersome, and their continued reliance on Room Service to undercut Beardsley's definition is very puzzling, ex- plicable perhaps only because they wished, and still wish, to further the career of Rainer and anyone associated-socially, ideologi- cally, or politically-with her. If, on the other hand, Beardsley based his theory on Augustine's view that dance is rhythmical movement intended exclusively to give pleasure-as a fresh reading of his article suggests he did-then that theory is much more powerful and relevant to general dance practice. As I said in 1997, on this in- terpretation Beardsley first takes dance to be a sequence of rhythmical motions that are both wholly non-practical and for the sake of pleasure. However, he adds expressive- ness as another possible source of pleasure, and subsequently allows that some but not all movement in the work is practical, thereby modifying the first Augustinian con- dition. Finally, he indicates that superfluity of expression is a mark of dance, which means for me a sign that something is dance or that some of the movement is non-practi- cal. To clarify now what I very briefly said before about rhythm and pleasure-two matters that were incidental to my thesis but that Carroll and Banes have recently tar- geted-I should add now that Beardsley in- dicates without argument that rhythm would be neither necessary nor sufficient for some- thing to be dance "even if it may be a very useful criterion of dancehood" (1989, 640). "Criterion" obviously for him means some- thing like "a good indication," and is simi- lar, it seems to me, to a superfluity of ex- pression as a "mark" of dance. Furthermore, Beardsley states that pleasure is too restric- tive a goal for all dance, and purposefully leaves aside the topic of the other permis- sible goals for another opportunity (1989, 640). However, through the device of me- tonymy, in which a part stands for a whole, Dance Research Journal 31/1 (Spring 1999) 13</page><page sequence="3">in the rest of his article he may well be using pleasure for those other goals. In short, dance arguably for him ultimately becomes move- ment that at least in part is non-practical, has as its goal pleasure or something appropri- ately analogous, and involves typically ei- ther rhythm or expressiveness (or, perhaps as a better reflection of any non-practicality, a superfluity of expressiveness). This notion, I suggested in my previous article, could embrace Room Service if at least some of this work's movements were not practical (whether or not they looked practical), or if the context of the work infused even wholly practical movements with the requisite expressivity. In their most recent article, Carroll and Banes ignore the possibility that Room Ser- vice might not be practical even though it looks practical. They also deny that con- textuality gives expressiveness, claiming that contextualization is a framing but that fram- ing does not "infect a work with expressive properties in the way philosophers and aestheticians, like Beardsley, standardly use that concept"; lastly, they contend that dances like Room Service simply are not ex- pressive (1998, 19). To argue properly with these points, all of which I think are problem- atic, would involve showing, for instance, that there has been no standard view of ex- pressiveness even after R.G. Collingwood published The Principles of Art in 1935, per- haps the most comprehensive treatment of the expression theory of art. Or it would in- volve showing that, even if there had been a standard view, it was not the best one and did not entail that expression would be an "infec- tion" when caused by a "framing," whatever this latter term means. All of this is beyond the range of this work. Nevertheless, an analysis of remarks made by Beardsley, Banes, and Carroll themselves pertaining to expression will amply illustrate that even dance theorists like Carroll himself and Deborah Jowitt do not use "expression" in a standard way, and that Room Service may well be expressive in the proper sense. Let us start with Carroll and Banes's own words: dance is the artform that, among other things, is by nature devoted to foregrounding movements and their qualities for their own sake. But this movement [in Room Service or in task dances] is not expressive-it does not project anthropomorphic properties or a surfeit of them. (1998, 19) Now, I have no problem with someone say- ing that dance is devoted to foregrounding movement for its own sake, although I prefer to leave the term "foregrounding" to painters or art historians. Furthermore, "for their own sake"-a notion that goes back to Plato's Phaedo and that in effect is called a "final cause" by Aristotle (Physics II, 2)-rather puzzles when applied to inanimate things like movements. Normally, final causes are only thought to be relevant, literally or di- rectly, to creatures like animals, which can deliberate or improve themselves. For in- stance, we might say "He stole food for the sake of his child," but it would be bizarre to say that something was for the sake of a rock or of a motion, unless by this we meant ellip- tically the value that accrued to someone owning the rock or to an audience viewing the motion or something similar. Leaving this issue aside, though, we can see one serious difficulty with Carroll and Banes's quotation above: Expressiveness need not be a projec- tion of anthropomorphic properties. Geomet- ric shapes can be expressive of metaphysical or astronomical order, neither of which is an- thropomorphic, and some dance from an- cient times to Louis XIV and later involved such shapes to express the related phenom- enon. A fortiori, expressive dance need not project a surfeit of anthropomorphic proper- ties. More importantly, it seems transparent from Beardsley's own words that he himself would or should agree with a broad use of 14 Dance Research Journal 31/1 (Spring 1999)</page><page sequence="4">expressiveness, and would or should con- sider Room Service to be expressive. When speaking of some of the movements in Anna Sokolow's Rooms, and Marcia Siegel's de- scription thereof, he says: If we are wary, I think we can make do with the word expressive to mark her [Siegel's] meaning-and mine. When I use the word in this context [my emphasis], I refer to regional qualities [his own italics] of a motion or sequence of motions: it has an air of momentousness or mystery or majesty; it is abrupt, loose, heavy, decisive, or languid. To say that the motion is expressive is just to say that it has some such quality to a fairly intense degree. And this is all I mean by "expressive." (Beardsley 1989,639) Of course, it will be crucial what "some such quality" means here for Beardsley, given the disparity of examples he has just given, and it might be thought that he ignores a sense of "expressive" with which many would sympathize: "manifesting inner states," in contrast to "being inscrutable." However, one reason he may ignore this sense is that he is only concerned with "regional qualities" in a certain context, pertaining to a motion or to a single sequence of motions. Expressive- ness of the face, then, or of other aspects of the body or of an entire dance are seemingly being left aside, and very possibly for him a whole work has in virtue of its fuller aspects other non-regional qualities that may be ex- pressive in their own right. Beardsley admittedly gives the immedi- ate impression above that a highly-charged intensity is the hallmark of expressiveness, as he does again later when claiming that a sequence of motions is dance when it is ex- pressive in virtue of its fairly intense voli- tional qualities. Again, however, he is speak- ing of a sequence of motions. Furthermore, as he himself forthrightly recognizes that this might be a problem, and lest we think that all of this turns dance into sport, note what else he claims: First, "droopy exhaustion and mechanical compulsion-weaknesses of the will, as well as strengths"(1989, 639) can be expressive, which suggests that movements for him do not have to be highly energetic, athletic, or imbued with technical expertise. Second, expressiveness can also result from, for instance, Merce Cunningham's dances, because they provide an amplification of energy. This remark, on the one hand, rein- forces the initial impression that intensity is the hallmark of expressiveness, but, on the other hand, complicates the whole issue be- cause Cunningham dropped the kind of ex- pressiveness for which moder dance pio- neers and former employers like Martha Graham were famous (recall the earlier re- mark about Cunningham allowing pedestrian movement in 1950). At any rate, Beardsley mentions further that "like working-repre- sentations, saying-representations can con- tribute much to the expressiveness of mo- tions in dance" (1989, 641). This last utterance naturally implies that working-representations can indeed be ex- pressive and is especially telling, because Room Service qualifies, I would propose, as a "work-representation" (and arguably as art or theatre because of its representationality). Carroll and Banes never address my 1997 argument that Room Service is mimetic, and so it is hard to say precisely how they would respond to the deduction that, since it com- prises mattress-carrying and similar tasks on their own description, it is in fact a task-rep- resentation and not a task, and thus very well covered by Beardsley. In other words, it looks practical but as a representation is not actually practical. Even if Carroll and Banes could resolve this issue satisfactorily, the host of adjectives that Beardsley gives as ex- amples of expressiveness, with the caveat "some such quality," imply that Room Ser- vice may still be covered: it, or at least some Dance Research Journal 31/1 (Spring 1999) 15</page><page sequence="5">important movement sequence in it, need only be mysterious or intriguing or some- thing similar. We can even leave aside this second riposte, for, as Carroll and Banes keep stressing, Room Service was "predicated upon drawing the audience's attention to the practical intelligence of the human body" (1998, 19). Since for them projecting anthro- pomorphic properties is what makes expres- sion, and since practical intelligence-and other qualities like stupidity, silliness, casu- alness, informality, dignity, and the like- are surely anthropomorphic properties, Room Service would have to be expressive. Independent, although slightly different, con- firmation can be gleaned from Grace Glueck, who, when writing about the work in the New York Times, suggests that masochism is be- ing expressed by the dancers: "three teams of dancers played follow-the-leader through a maze of obstacles strewn in their path by a trio of sadistic prop men" (Glueck 1965, 33). All of this, I trust, reveals that Room Service could well be expressive on Beardsley's un- derstanding of the term. Whether this under- standing fits an ostensibly standard concep- tion is another issue, and one that is not par- ticularly important for me, although the fol- lowing, stemming from an earlier article of Carroll's, "Post-Modem Dance and Expres- sion" (1981), demonstrates that the term has no favorite meaning even in dance circles. What is equally arresting is how that article, which resulted from a panel that included Jowitt, supports my previous arguments that Room Service can indeed be thought to be expressive and therefore covered by a chari- table interpretation of Beardsley's definition, or how it reveals confusion or unsettling am- biguity in Carroll and Banes's own thought. While discussing another work of Yvonne Rainer, Trio A (1966), Carroll distinguishes between narrow and wide senses of expres- sion. In the narrow sense, expression is of "an emotion, or some other anthropomorphic quality"; in the wide sense, it is of "ideas as well as feelings and other anthropomorphic qualities" (1981, 98). Trio A is expressive in the wide sense, he says, but not in the nar- row (1981, 99 and 101). "In comparison with...the Graham tradition, its reductive choices make it 'factual' as opposed to 'emo- tive,' 'cool' as opposed to 'impassioned,' and 'objective' as opposed to 'subjective"' (1981, 103) (2). We can notice immediately a few problems with Carroll's account. First, in comparison with Graham, Rainer may be factual, cool, and objective, but this says nothing about what she is in absolute terms, other than that she is conveying, for instance, the (expressive) quality of factuality. This is because Graham's symbolic, heroic, or oc- casionally bombastic style would make even some of Tudor's or Ashton's realistic, emo- tional dance-drama "cool" or "factual" by comparison! Second, both the narrow and wide senses of expression include anthropo- morphic qualities, which generates great confusion, because Carroll gives no way of isolating the anthropomorphic qualities be- longing with emotions from those belong- ing with feelings and ideas. Indeed, it is dif- ficult to see how he or anyone else could in the current arena, because what is needed is not merely a conceptual account relevant to psychology but a distinction between emo- tions and feelings/ideas, and between "nar- row" and "wide" anthropomorphic proper- ties, that could be made apparent with mere movement. Moreover, even if the distinc- tions can be properly made in ways relevant to dance, why would "feeling-expressions" not be as legitimate as "emotional-expres- sions" when ascertaining whether Room Service is expressive in the sense relevant to Beardsley? (Certainly, on the above reports, both Room Service and Trio A are expres- sive in the wide sense of the term.) I for one would enjoy hearing an account that settles all of this, one which ultimately demonstrates that Room Service had no emotion of any kind whatsoever or absolutely no other an- thropomorphic quality that would make it expressive in the narrow sense, and an ac- 16 Dance Research Journal 31/1 (Spring 1999)</page><page sequence="6">count which also shows that Beardsley's use of expression has to match Carroll's narrow sense. The account cannot be merely that movement in the narrow sense of expression is more intense, for, as previously stressed, Beardsley himself allows movements to ex- press "weakness of the will" or mechanical compulsion, and, in any event, one can mani- fest certain feelings-for instance, great pains or anguish-that are much more in- tense than "cool" emotions, say, equanim- ity. In addition to all of these problems with which Carroll is saddled, a noticeable dif- ference occurs in the use of "expressive" by him and Jowitt, the latter of whom in Carroll's article also distinguishes various senses of "expression" (all authors treat "ex- pressive" and "expression" identically, which I will continue to do). However, she sketches four senses: Expression is (i) of emotion, or (ii) of ideas, which Jowitt hints may not be well suited for dance (better perhaps suited for literature or for visual art). Also (iii), "there is the sense... as Monroe Beardsley uses it, I think, [of] a superfluity of expres- siveness, meaning I don't just reach my arm, I reach my arm-that full-charged, kind of burnished look we recognize as technically- accomplished dancing" (Carroll 1981, 104). Finally, (iv) there is the Langerian sense, re- flecting a "human response to the forces of the universe as felt-that is, gravity" (Carroll 1981, 105). In this sense, Jowitt says, "any dance to me has to be expressive or not be dance [my italics]" (Carroll 1981, 105), and she adds that Trio A is expressive in this par- ticular sense of the word and "does express certain factors about space, tensions in space, weight..." (Carroll 1981, 105). Leaving aside that Jowitt, contra Carroll, requires expressiveness of a certain sort for something to be dance, the differences in their use of the term "expressive" suggest that no standard denotation exists. In my view, this means nothing in and of itself for the important issues of this paper, but it al- lows us to dispense with Carroll and Banes's opposite claim and it underscores the prin- ciple that one must pay careful attention to how writers, in this case Beardsley, use a term in their own arguments before evaluat- ing them. Otherwise, of course, one typically engages in argument at cross purposes. Fur- thermore, in spite of Jowitt's own adum- brated distinctions in the 1981 work, it does not seem that she fully captures Beardsley's theory, because on her own description, ex- pressive just means with respect to Beardsley a superfluity of expressiveness and that just means being technically accomplished. However, the remarks on weakness of the will and exhaustion by Beardsley in 1982 (reprinted in 1989) indicate that a burnished, technical look no longer seem always re- quired for something to be expressive, if it ever had been. One can imagine that Beardsley may have wished, for example, that exhaustion be conveyed sometimes or most often by a technical look-such as a hinge, in which dancers go into a deep knee bend, with the torso held backwards almost horizontally, before they touch the arm and shoulder behind them to the floor and slide out to a supine position. But, unless he cham- pions an incredibly restricted notion of dance, one which Carroll and Banes never discuss from this exact angle, it is implau- sible to imagine that he would demand that weaknesses of the will and exhaustion be portrayed always with technically obvious movement. Moreover, it would be strange for a philosopher to identify x with "superfluity of x," in this case, expressiveness with its superfluity. Howsoever all of this may be, Jowitt's not covering completely Beardsley's account need not be surprising, and need not be a reflection on her analysis, because the theory of Beardsley to which she refers in 1981 apparently originated in 1979 at a con- ference, and Beardsley's final published ver- sion in 1982 may have been modified to ac- commodate not only her views but those of other, earlier criticisms. Dance Research Journal 31/1 (Spring 1999) 17</page><page sequence="7">We see, I trust, how little Carroll and Banes have really accomplished so far against Beardsley. At the very least, on his own ac- count of expressiveness and on either a rea- sonably charitable interpretation of his theory that permits mere expressiveness to be a source of "pleasure" or on a close reading that allows non-regional qualities to be expres- sive, they do not seem to have demonstrated that Room Service is ruled out of dance. Nor is it easy to imagine how they could. And to anticipate one of their possible objections, to claim that Beardsley himself did not exactly hold the charitable interpretation would be beside the point of dance scholarship. The best, legitimate version of a view carries pri- ority, and not any flaccid original. The ver- sion I sketched in 1997 developed a few op- tions for including Room Service under dance as Beardsley could have modified his theory, if it needed modification. I myself still think that Beardsley's defi- nition has a few problems, and as I explic- itly acknowledged (1997, 18), would drop "expressiveness" from what I think is a suit- able definition of dance, even though expres- sion can be a powerful feature to incorpo- rate at times. Purely formal rhythmical movement with the right intention or goal that has no expressiveness in any relevant sense can be dance, it seems to me. In any event, I can stay removed from the debate about expressiveness between the "Beardsleyans," and invest my effort in po- tentially richer tracts, for instance, defend- ing rhythm as a necessary condition of dance (if we choose necessary and sufficient con- ditions rather than, say, functionalism as our way of defining). Carroll and Banes offered in their recent article a number of arguments against rhythm. Perhaps it will not be unfair of me to say without presenting the counter-argu- ments here that those arguments can be easily refuted, especially if one defines rhythm as "ordered body movement," following Plato and Aristoxenus from ancient times and Margaret H'Doubler and Alma Hawkins from the twentieth century (3), rather than in- voking the musical or generic notion of rhythm that Carroll and Banes favor. They also pronounce or strongly suggest a number of other dubious, muddled, or preposterous claims: that I use "criterion" in a "grossly misleading" fashion, as "a piece of philo- sophical jargon that means 'defining fea- ture"' (1998, 20); that no one seriously de- fends pleasure as a goal of art and, by impli- cation, of dance; that I, unlike them, do not trust danceworld practitioners to be reliable indicators of the limit of dance; that I am try- ing to cashier not only Room Service but all task dances out of the realm of dance; that Carroll's doctrine of historical narratives is not inherently weak; and so forth and so on. Again, I have no space left to address these issues, all of which, except the one dealing with "criterion," would require sig- nificant discussion. (That Carroll and Banes completely misrepresent my use of "crite- rion" can be quickly ascertained: Simply go back to Beardsley's introduction of the term noted earlier, where it meant something like "a good indicator" and where it was explic- itly contrasted with necessary and sufficient conditions. Also recall that in 1997 I rebut- ted each and every reason Carroll and Banes gave for including Room Service under dance, which is the crucial methodological consideration, one that is independent of any meaning of "criterion.") Nevertheless, even without the supporting counter-arguments- which I would happily send as an e-mail at- tachment to anyone upon request (gs30@is3.nyu.edu)-the kind of thinking that Carroll and Banes have displayed above with respect to expression is primafacie evi- dence that their other, related doctrines and criticisms are equally perforated with subtle or unsubtle flaws. Gregory Scott New York University, New School University 18 Dance Research Journal 31/1 (Spring 1999)</page><page sequence="8">NOTES (1) Beardsley 1982, and Carroll and Banes 1982. An encapsulated history of the debate up to their recent article (1998) is this: Carroll and Banes construe Beardsley as defining dance as (movement with) a superfluity of expression, offer Room Service as a counterexample, and anticipate a potential retort that the work is not even dance by presenting three or four theories for including it. I argue that not only is there a better way to read Beardsley's work but that none of the theories they give is efficacious; rather the theories reveal just as well, if not more, that Room Service is something other than dance. (2) Curiously, "reductive, factual, objective..." are said by Banes to characterize by 1973 a whole style of post-moder dance (1987, xx). One reason this is curious is that post-modernism is often identified with a rejection of objectivity: see, for instance, Adshead- Lansdale and Layson, 1994, esp. pp. 10ff. But this issue must stay a curiosity for the purposes of this paper. (3) For another discussion of kinesthetic rhythm, see Crawford (1992, 68). Aristoxenus's work was well known in antiquity but has been mostly lost. See Sparshott (1995, esp. 157-163) and Williams for relatively accessible discussions in, respectively, dance and music theory. BIBLIOGRAPHY Adshead-Lansdale, Janet, and June Layson, eds.
