Hence, She is and remains an object to be both loved and feared. Life, hence, is not for them an incitement to idealism and romantic escape. Neither is it a commandment to build a New Jerusalem. On the contrary, it is an invitation to a positive, existential realism, a passivism, and a fatalism in which there is little need or room for the notion of moral reconstruction, whether of the individual or of society. And given the native's highly individuated and personalized source of supernatural power in the form of a personalized guardian spirit, the absence of any such notions of moral reconstruction is scarely surprising. Indeed, it would be surprising, logically, if this were not in fact the case. These divergent moral views evidently depend in turn on the mythological postulates which are culturally accepted concerning the form and content of the act of creation itself. Was the world created at some point in time and place prior to the beginning of history, or is it seen as having been somehow in existence from the primordial beginning, as something always given as a fait accompli? If the former is the case, then a Creator God, an order-establishing God, is both logically necessary and unavoidable. If not, then no Creator God is needed. Neither is there any necessity for an order-establishing God, but what is now most urgently required is an equilbrium-maintaining, a balance-maintaining, force of some kind, whether this be called "the Great Spirit," or Nature, or whatever. Hence, the notion of unity, in its simplistic sense, is not essential; neither, for that matter, is the idea of simple anthropomorphic personification. Polytheistic plurality on the part of the Great Spirit can be logically tolerated, even though a notion of impersonal remoteness on His part may not be. Native persons thus need not look to the Great Spirit-as-Governor, as we do, but only to a vitalistic manifestation of His being.</page></plain_text>
