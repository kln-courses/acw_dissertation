<plain_text><page sequence="1">- 19 - VOYAGES TOWARDS AN ABSENT CENTRE: LANDSCAPE INTERPRETATION AND TEXTUAL STRATEGY IN JOSEPH CONRAD'S HEART OF DARKNESS AND JULES VERNE'S VOYAGE AU CENTRE DE LA TERRE To compare the novels of Joseph Conrad and Jules Verne might seem an unlikely proposition, or even an act of academic expediency. After all, the two writers are linked neither by history nor by style; in addition, the abiding tendency to consider Conrad's works 'classic' and Verne's 'popular' has prevented, or at least dissuaded, critics from comparing them. I would suggest, however, that an association between Conrad and Verne is by no means unwarranted: first, because there are areas of thematic commonality between their works, notably in their demon strated fascination with geography; second, because it is possible to consider their respective novels as a variation on a common genre, the adventure novel (roman d'aventure); and third, because both writers are clearly influenced by the dominant ideologies of late nineteenth-century Europe, in particular the rise of (and response to) positivist science. Although I aim to touch on each of these areas, my focus is on the first. Concern with geographical issues made explicit in the non-fictional works of Conrad and Verne</page><page sequence="2">20 - is also implicit in their fiction. The titles of Verne's novels, and the subtitles of Conrad's, are often geogra phically situated. In Verne's case, the highlighting of geography in the title of the work announces the ideological programme implemented in the course of the work. Geography, in this sense, involves both a classification and a conquest of the natural environment. In Conrad's case, the secondary position of geography in the subtitle of the work illus trates the subordination of location to action, but also suggests the interdependence between location and action in the work. 'The earth is a stage,' writes Conrad in the late essay 'Geography and Some Explorers', 'and though it may be an advantage, even to the right comprehension of the play, to know its exact configuration, it is the drama of human endeavour that will be the thing.' (1) The drama of human endeavour enacted in Conrad's fiction corresponds to two kinds of geography: one of action, and one of the mind. In the first instance, man strives for ascendancy over his natural environment; in the second, for control over his own desires. Conrad's introspective 'geography of the mind' can be situated in the context of late nineteenth-century European thought, its phenomeno logically-grounded inquiry into and criticism of the self serving to offset the se1f-glorifying tendencies of High Positivist doctrine. (2) His combative 'geography of action', on the other hand, links with his critique of imperialist expansion, although, as I hope to show, he</page><page sequence="3">- 21 - distinguishes between the means of imperial conquest and the idea of imperialism. Further inquiry into the implications of Conrad's geography may benefit from the theories of geographers as well as those of literary critics. Despite recent develop ments, the links between geography and literature (and vice versa) remain tenuous. One work which attempts to compensate for the deficiency is Cosgrove and Daniels' The Iconography of Landscape. Until recently, the term 'landscape' has tended to go by subject area (literature, geography, fine arts, etc.). Cosgrove and Daniels, however, break down or blur the distinctions between these areas by considering landscape in terms of the theory and history of symbolic imagery. 'A landscape,' they state in their introduction, 'is a cultural image, a pictorial way of representing, structuring, or symbolizing surroundings.' They continue; In human geography the interpretation of landscape and culture has a tendency to reify landscape as an object of empiricist investigation, but often its practitioners do gesture towards landscape as a cultural symbol or image, notably when likening landscape to a text and its interpretation to reading. (3) Cosgrove and Daniels' comments draw on a number of sources, among them Carl Sauer's notion of cultural landscape as a structure or structures superimposed on the natural environ ment, and Courtice Rose's notion of landscape as a textual sign-system subject to complex processes of encoding and decoding. These latter notions, I would suggest, can be used to inform Marlow's reading of the landscape in Heart of Darkness and, by extension, to inform our subsequent</page><page sequence="4">- 22 - readings of Marlow's reconstructed text. The 'African' landscape of Heart of Darkness symbolizes a disruption of the balance between man and his environment: indigenous 'nature' is duly exploited, subjugated and restructured in the name of alien 'culture'. Carl Sauer's distinction between 'natural* and 'cultural' landscapes sheds light on the imperialist project being undertaken, criticized, and, I believe, ultimately reinstated in Conrad's novel. Sauer's claim is as follows: The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape is the result... with the introduction of a different - that is, an alien - culture, a rejuvenation of the cultural landscape sets in, or a new landscape is superimposed on remnants of an older one. (4) In Heart of Darkness, Western (European) trading companies are the primary cultural agents; by operating upon an environment which they identify in their turn as 'alien', the commercial agents of Western culture effect the super imposition of a 'new' landscape 'on remnants of an older one' The authority claimed by the imposed culture is challenged, however, by alternative readings of the cultural landscape which reflect a tension between the natural environment and the perceptions, inscriptions and transfor mations of the cultural agent. Yi-Fu Tuan has reinscribed this tension within what he calls an 'axial transformation in world view from cosmos to landscape' (5) which, tending towards the semantic conver gence of the terms nature, landscape and scenery, has</page><page sequence="5">- 23 - denoted Nature as (vertically arranged, transcendental) cosnos to nature as (horizontally aligned, culturally determined) landscape. Combining Sauer's and Tuan's theses, it is possible in Heart of Darkness to chart the abortive attempts of an imposed culture to convert Nature into land scape and to suppress alternative 'readings' which might call that projected conversion into question. Implicit in this attempt is a deterministic attitude towards the environment which, according to Lewontin, Rose and Kamin, conceives of nature as 'a source of raw materials to be extracted, an alien force to be controlled, tamed and exploited in the interests of the newly dominant class' . (6) The newly dominant class is identified by Lewontin et al. as the rapidly developing bourgeois society of late nineteenth century Europe,whose conception of science as a path to inevitable progress, bolstered by the discoveries of the Technological Revolution and the geographical expansion of the Imperial Age, solicits a confirmation of man's supremacy over his physical environment. Marsh's work Man and Nature (1864) typifies this ideology. Claims Marsh: Man cannot subsist and rise to the full development of [his] higher propertie-s, unless brute and unconscious nature be effectively combatted and, in a greater degree, vanquished by human art. (7) The connection is clear between this extreme form of geogra phical determinism and the expansionist policies of imperialism, informed by notions of inherent superiority and propelled by a 'civilizing' mission. The landscapes of</page><page sequence="6">- 24 - Heart of Darkness imply a relation between topography and personal/cultural identity which is indissociable from the imperialistic discourse which gives it expression and the technological resources which lend it power; (8) for an intende'd conversion of Nature into landscape activates both the physical conquest of the natural environment and the discursive practices which justify that conquest. Landscape, in this sense, denotes a reinscription of the transcendental signified ('Nature's Laws') within the context of a rhetoric of authority ('cultural imperative'). The main figures of this imperative are the steamboat, forcing its way into the interior, and, from the 'heart' of the interior, Kurtz's disembodied Voice which, substituting propagandistic mono logue for personal dialogue, constitutes a self-privileging discourse of the other. (9) The connection of Marlow with these cultural agents is crucial, for Marlow is the text's inscribed reader; his interpretation of (and navigation through) the landscape brings us into contact with the text but also allows us to infer other 'readings' which comment on and ultimately undermine his own. As Courtice Rose has suggested, there is a correlation between the praxis of geography and the procedure of text interpretation. (10) A landscape can be considered in these terms as a codified text which is encoded by those who act upon it and decoded by those who assess it. As text, land scape is both written and read; since reading is itself a</page><page sequence="7">- 25 - form of writing, as much an encoding as a decoding process, the geographer becomes both reader and writer of the land scapes he perceives. The perceiver does not merely decipher; he alters what is perceived, imposing on it the weight of his personal and cultural preference. It is clear, then, that Marlow's 'reading* of the landscape is only one of many possible readings; by reading between the lines of Marlow's reading, we may consequently revise and reinterpret the text in our turn. Marlow's reading, impelled in spite of itself by what Edward Said has called an 'imperialist discourse' , (11) is in effect a misreading, or at best a biased and evasive reading which, as I will show, attempts to disabuse itself of the very ideology that informs it. Evidence is not hard to find of the 'partiality' (in both senses of the term) of Marlow's reading. At the Outer Station, the negative effects of a conversion from Nature to landscape are delineated: At last we opened a reach. A rocky cliff appeared, mounds of turned-up earth by the shore, houses on a hill, others with iron roofs, amongst a waste of excavations, or hanging to the declivity. A continuous noise of the rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation. (12) Nature has been transformed into a wasteland in which the 'carcass' of 'an undersized railway-truck lying there on its back with its wheels in the air' signifies a perverse anthropomorphism, a substitution of decadent (techno-) culture for nature. Similarly, leaving the immediate environs of the station, Marlow encounters:</page><page sequence="8">- 26 - paths, paths everywhere; a stamped-in network of paths spreading over the empty land, through long grass, through burnt grass, through thickets, down and up chilly ravines, up and down stony hills ablaze with heat; and a solitude, a solitude, nobody, not a hut. (IP,p.70) The mapping out of the land suggests an appropriation of space which, although uninhabited, bears the mark of an absent 'owner* Nature's laws are subsumed in property law; the emptiness of the land is a fitting symbol of(and implicit critique of)the wastefulness of indiscriminate imperial expansion. A closer look at Marlow's reading of the landscape suggests, however, that what appears to be a critique of an imperialist attitude towards nature is actually inscribed within the rhetoric of an imperialist discourse. Sympto matic of this rhetoric is a suppression of, or at least a failure to account for, alternative modes of expression which might challenge its authority. The most obvious example of this, of course, is Marlow's inability to under stand the languages which render the natives' rites 'unspeakable' and the harlequin's notes 'unreadable'. It is also worth remembering that Marlow's tale is rarely interrupted; like Kurtz's, his is a single voice speaking from the darkness. The similarity between Kurtz's discourse and Marlow's is not totally lost on Marlow himself, but it is obvious throughout the text that Marlow is, to some extent, suspending his (self) critical faculties. One example of this is the sudden shift from a critical to a non-critical focus: descending the hill at the Outer</page><page sequence="9">- 27 - Station, Marlow discovers: a vast artificial hole somebody had been digging on the slope, the purpose of which I found it impossible to divine. It wasn't a quarry or a sandpit, anyhow. It was just a hole. (HP.p.65) 'Just a hole': yet it is these holes, cracks and gullies which, interspersed throughout the textual landscape of Heart of Darkness, suggest not only that what is not being described (or explained) is worthy of consideration, but that the gaps and absences in the text may be filled by readings which undermine or invalidate the dominant discourse of the narrative. (13) Two further examples underscore the notion of a 'partial reading' of the landscape which either fails to account for or actively suppresses other 'readings'. In the first, Marlow, up-river, sketches out this impressionistic land scape : The high stillness of primeval forest was before my eyes; there were shiny patches on the black creek. The moon had spread over everything a thin layer of silver - over the rank grass, over the mud, upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the wall of a temple, over the great river I would see through a sombre gap glittering, glittering, as it flowed broadly by without a murmur.... (HP,p.81) Marlow's description is of a natural environment which apparently resists its percipient; on reflection, however, the protective walls Marlow describes are less the prbduct of natural laws than of narrative strategies: it is not so much that Marlow does not see, but that he does not wish to see. 'The inner truth is hidden - luckily, luckily,' claims Marlow (HD,p.93), but is it really as 'hidden' as he claims?</page><page sequence="10">- 28 - After all, Conrad informs us in his preface that 'Heart of Darkness... is experience pushed u little (and only very little) beyond the actual facts of the case.' (HD.p.xxxv) Marlow's use of the indeterminate adjective, specifically, and of the rhetorical devices of literary impressionism, generally, blur the narrative perspective by concealing truths which are not hidden in the nebulous realms of a 'heart of darkness' but at the very surface of the text. (14) One of these truths is that Marlow is not merely a critic of but a participant in the imperial mission. He is not unaware of this, of course; as he admits self-ironically at one point: 'I also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings.' (Hp,p.65) For the major part of the narrative, however, he diverts our attention from his own complicity by concentrating on a parodic critique of others (Kurtz, the station manager, the harlequin, etc.) and, above all, by wilfully limiting and obscuring his narration. Marlow's reading of the landscape, for example, is carefully framed so as to accentuate certain details and blur or exclude others. The frame is flawed, however; the existence of a geographical gap suggests in turn a textual absence which implies that Marlow's immobilization of the environment, on the one hand, and his obfuscation of the environment, on the other, are tactics of an unwarranted narrative preservation. (15) Marlow's description of Kurtz's hut at the Inner Station is more specific:</page><page sequence="11">- 29 - A long decaying building on the summit was half buried in high grass; the large holes in the peaked roof gaped black from afar... there was no enclosure or fence of any kind; but there had been one apparently. (HP.p.121) Here the gaps loom larger, and the protective enclosures/ fences have been broken down; the narrator chooses to concentrate, however, on what had once been there: the defining contours of the landscape are reinstated (brought back from the recesses of memory) by the narrative. The acknowledgement and paradoxical encroachment of 'absence' on the 'presence' of the narrative, together with the increa singly blurred outlines of its presentation, are nonetheless indicative of the insecurity of Marlow's narration. The configuration of landscape becomes, in this sense, a last line of defence, a final frontier beyond which the narrative refuses to venture. As I have suggested, the conversion of Nature into landscape assumes the absolute authority of a transcendental signified in the posture of an imperialist rhetoric. Our revision of Marlow's reading of the landscape does not relocate this signified, however, but rather switches the relationship between signifiers from one code to another, or, more specifically, from an included code to an excluded one. In deciphering what Marlow chooses not to decipher, our own reading effects a transference of ciphers. To illustrate more fully what I mean, I will refer to two further types of cipher which elicit similar kinds of 'readings': the map and the manual. The map in Heart of Parkness is a graphic representation</page><page sequence="12">- 30 - of the cultural landscape: as a tool of cultural imposition, it tends to register a narrowly propagandistic, rather than a broadly communicative, intent. (16) For Marlow, retracing the route already set out for him, the map reveals nothing: it registers a transference not from blank space to known (charted) space but from blank space to darkness. '[Africa] had ceased to be a blank space of delightful mystery - a white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over. It had become a place of darkness.' (HD,p.52) Similarly, the notes to Towson's navigation manual, indecipherable to Marlow, turn out to be written in Russian, a language (verbal code) Marlow cannot understand. The code is not broken: it is merely switched; the manual, like the map, acts as a metaphor for the reading process which involves exchange rather than explanation, renewed encoding rather than decoding. Significantly, the harlequin turns out to have written the notes in Towson's manual (harlequin: man of many identities, switcher/juggler of 'codes'). There is a sense, too, in which our own readings of the landscape, paradigmatic of our readings of the text, are also mis-readings in that, despite our ability to see through Marlow's self-deception, to isolate and explore the absences of his narrative, we are caught in the same web of lies, the same desire to protect the notions of linguistic solidarity on which (our) Western civilization is based. As Ian Watt puts it: 'Marlow enjoin[s] us to defend ourselves in full knowledge of the difficulties to which we have been</page><page sequence="13">- 31 - blinded by the illusions of civilization.' (17) In witnessing the conversion from Nature to landscape, from transcendental signified to cultural signifier, we are invited not only to defend ourselves but to defend the very notion of signification on which Western discourse, and the idea of 'civilization' enshrined in it, depends. (18) I would like to develop the argument by comparing Heart of Darkness with Jules Verne's early novel Voyage au centre de la terre. It is striking that neither Marlow in the former nor Lidenbrock in the latter reach the 'centre'; indeed, it is precisely their failure to do so which guarantees their safe return and enables the preservation (and reproduction) of their narrative. The journey to the centre is downward, and also back ward (both novels implicitly comment on the contemporary evolutionary theories of Darwin and Spencer) (19) but the paradox applies to both Conrad and Verne that a journey which aspires to the source never leaves the surface. In Heart of Darkness. Marlow's narration conceals rather than reveals by claiming to look towards a mysterious centre while blurring the outlines of (disguising) its surface appearance. In Voyage au centre de la terre. the narrator's journey does not lead him to any kind of 'deeper' knowledge or understanding but through a succession of incidents which, like the geological strata through which he moves, proceed from one surface to the next. Like Marlow's, Lidenbrock's reading of the landscape is</page><page sequence="14">- 32 - incomplete; articulate, erudite, but impractical, Lidenbrock is able to identify and categorize the rock-forms of the volcano but unable to navigate a path through its labyrin thine underground passages. Lidenbrock's explanations are homilies on the already-known, the practised speeches of the dry academician; a typical address is his eulogy of the human skeleton he discovers in the bone-beds: J'ai l'honneur de vous presenter un homme de l'e'poque quaternaire. De grands savants on nie* son existence, d'autres non moins grands l'ont affirme*e... vous pouvez le voir, le toucher. Ce n'est pas un squelette, c'est un corps intact, conserve* dans un but uniquement anthropologique! (20) For Lidenbrock, speech is the demonstration of seemingly incontestible knowledge; it is significant, however, that it is his opposite, the inarticulate, increasingly silent Hans, who is chiefly responsible for guiding the party towards the centre of the earth. Hans has no need for words: he is able to negotiate his environment because it is familiar to him, but also because he does not distance himself from it (explain it) through the act of verbalization. As in Heart of Darkness, there is the suggestion that, although verbal language misleads, misdirects, distorts, it must nonetheless be defended against the twin threats of silence and madness. As Axel explains: Son [Hans's] mutisme s'augmentait de jour en jour. Je crois meme qu'il nous gagnait. Les objets exterieurs ont une action re"elle sur le cerveau. Qui s'enferme entre quatre murs finit par perdre la faculte d'associer les ide*es et les mots. Que de prisonniers cellulaires devenus imbeciles, sinon fous, par le de'faut d'exercice des faculty's pensantes! ( VCT. p . 208) Speech, for Axel and Lidenbrock, is the tool of reasoned</page><page sequence="15">- 33 - thought; its disuse leads to disorientation and, potentially, to madness. As Hans loses the faculty of speech, he changes gradually into Primitive (pre-verbal) Man in a transfor mation which, following the logic of the narrative, amounts to debasement: 'son masque effrayant est celui d'un homme antediluvien, contemporain des ichtyosaures et des megatheriums.' (VCT.p.284) Hans's 'regression1 is symptomatic of the decreasing power of verbal language to classify, explain and organise experience as the physical/textual journey proceeds towards its intangible/non-verbal centre. At the deepest level they reach, Lidenbrock and his company find themselves in a subterranean forest in which the variety and intermixture of flora 'e*tait a* confondre la raison des classificateurs les plus inge*nieux de la botanique terrestre' (VCT.p.317). The empirical procedures of a science of objectsTwhich had previously listed its findings securely in a diachronic succession of landscapes, gives way increasingly to a synchronically conceived, dimly intuited phenomenology of the subject in which, as Axel puts it in his dream, 'toute la vie de la terre se resume en moi.' (VCT.p.261). The switch from empirical evidence to subjective conjecture is, in another sense, the result of a failure of writing: Saknussemm's runic manuscript is ultimately indecipherable, leading its followers into the heart of the maze, then abandoning them there. The unreliability of verbal language is complemented by</page><page sequence="16">- 34 - the geographical motif of the unfound centre. Lidenbrock and his company are able to follow Saknussemm's route so far, but no further: they are neither able to attain their objective nor to resolve its 'meaning'. In Heart of Darkness. Marlow pursues a similar journey which takes him to the furthest point of navigation (the Inner Station) but not to the 'centre'. It is worth considering in more detail why the experiences of both Lidenbrock and Marlow are 'inconclusive' (HD,p.51). In Heart of Darkness, geographical return is consonant with narrative preservation; it is essential that Marlow returns from his journey, because otherwise no tale can be told. Likewise in Voyage au centre de la terre, the safe return of the group is a prerequisite for the telling of the tale, a condition of possibility for the narrative. Saknussem, it is suggested, may in fact have reached the 'centre', but the price he pays for his achievement is to be branded a heretic, and to have his work suppressed by a society which, intent on the preservation of its existing value structures, does not wish to hear of origins. The 'truth' at the centre of Verne's novel envisions the descent of man from his civilized present to his barbaric past; in this sense, Voyage au centre de la terre. like Heart of Darkness. demonstrates an attraction towards Darwin's thesis but a final recoil from its implication that a return to the origin reverses the process of civilization to reveal the essential bestiality of man. (21) The safe return of the</page><page sequence="17">- 35 - protagonists ensures the (re)production of the narrative and the perpetuation of the dominant but threatened ideology (expressed, in Conrad's novel, in the discourse of imperialism and, in Verne's, in the discourse of scientific rationalism). Thus, although, at a general level, verbal language seems unreliable and, more specifically, the dominant narrative discourse seems invalid or at least questionable, there is, by the end of both novels, a corroboration of both. In Conrad's case, the figure of Kurtz's Intended implies a continuation of the will ('intention') of imperialism; (22) in Verne's, the last word is given to Lidenbrock, whose influence has now spread to 'toutes les soci^t^s scientifiques, geographiques et mine*ralogiques des cinq parties du monde' (VCT. p . 372) . The retention and validation of the 'protagonist' (Marlow/ Lidenbrock) is measured against the exclusion and/or elimination of the 'antagonist' (Kurtz/Saknussemm) whose discoveries might explode the myths of sanity, reason and order on which Western civilization and its signifying practices are founded. The reading and writing of landscape, I have argued, is one such practice. In recognizing attempted clarification (deciphering) as a form of obfuscation or evasion (Marlow's reading) and attempted objectification as a privileging of the subject (Lidenbrock's reading), our own readings isolate the paradoxical, or even contradictory, aspects of narrative presentation. Focus is therefore shifted from strategies of</page><page sequence="18">- 36 - control or domination in the narrative to gaps opened up by a discrepancy between supposedly self-evident facts (the 'objective' markers of a landscape) and uncertain suppositions (the subjective claims projected onto a land scape)". A case in point is Conrad's use of impressionism: in one sense, impressionistic readings of the landscape enable Marlow to hide from what he claims he cannot see, but actually does not wish to disclose, (23) but in another sense the shifting perceptions of impressionism question the authority of even Marlow's most explicit readings to suggest that the 'evidence' of his eyes may be no more than the exercise of his volition. (24) In Voyage au centre de la terre, vision does not appear at first to be consciously or unconsciously obstructed. There is no impressionism or blurred perspective in Verne's novel: landscape is strictly defined, hard-edged, angular. As in Vingt mille lieues sous les mers. (25) geography conforms to the rules of geometry: Nous marchions sur ces roches pesantes d'un gris fonce que le refroidissement avait moule'es en prismes a base hexagone. Au loin se voyaient un grand nombre de cdnes aplatis, qui furent jadis autant de bouches ignivomes. (VCT,pp.129-130) The landscape reads as a history of form: Nature as timeless cosmogony is reduced to nature as historically-determined composition. Marlow's 'impressionistic' reading and Lidenbrock's 'explicative' reading can both be traced back, however, to an ideology of conquest. The former invokes 'mystery' to distract attention from the material debauchery</page><page sequence="19">- 37 - of imperialist culture; the latter invokes 'science* to justify the conquest of Nature by the intelligence and to disguise the true place of man within the evolutionary process of Nature by placing him above and against it. In both Conrad's and Verne's novels, the conquest of Nature constitutes a formative act of the intelligence to which the cultural/textual phenomenon of landscape lends its 'shaping force' (343): both novels narrate journeys exploring the patterns and processes of biological, cultural and linguistic formation. Julia Kristeva's general remarks on form are useful here: The history of human forming is rooted in language as a system of propositions. No forming can transcend its origin-meaning, as it is posited by that predication peculiar to language. If the metaphysical solidarity of 'meaning', 'origin' and 'forming' is thus posited as the limit of any attempt at clarification... it still seems clear that any spatial representation provided for within a universal language is necessarily subject to teleological reason. (26) Yet, in their enquiries into form and formation, neither Heart of Darkness nor Voyage au centre de la terre seem able to vindicate the 'metaphysical solidarity' on which their dominant discourse is predicated. Let me introduce the problem another way by referring to Wilson Harris's essay 'The Frontier on Which Heart of Darkness Stands'. Heart of Darkness is a frontier novel, claims Harris, in that 'it stands upon a threshold of capacity to which Conrad pointed though he never attained that capacity himself.' (27) Over stepping that threshold results in the loss of 'reason' (Kurtz) and, correspondingly, the loss of a propositional</page><page sequence="20">- 38 - language which has been taken to the absurd conclusions of its logical premises (Kurtz's manifesto). (28) The motif of the threshold indicates therefore an attempted preservation of form at the frontiers of formlessness which combats the awareness that the solidarity of 'meaning-origin* on which form/formation is predicated may only be a saving illusion. It is possible in this context to see Conrad's 'heart' and Verne's 'centre' as figures of a non-propositional (non explicative) discourse. Hence, although they may be implied in the text, they are actually excluded from it. This para doxically provides both a means and a denial of access; on the one hand, it is possible to reach the centre by a 'leap of the imagination', as it were, which can only be sanctioned within the context of fictional narrative (Kurtz's vision in Heart of Darkness, Axel's dream in Voyage au centre de la terre); on the other hand, the implication of a 'mysterious' centre or origin of significance actually denies the reader access to that centre/origin. The centre is claimed to be 'elsewhere'; really, however, it is heretical, taboo: it remains notional because were it to materialize it would destroy both the 'fiction-effect' of the narrative and expose the ideology of the narrator. (29) The avoidance of a textual 'centre' turns our attention back to the surface structures of the narrative. The description and inscription of landscape take place at this surface level, yet the strategies adopted (devastation, obfuscation, classification, etc.) betray an underlying</page><page sequence="21">- 39 - principle of control which posits landscape not just as 'text* but as the directed reading of text. Marlow's land scapes are the products of his reading and of his attempted concealment of other readings; we are asked to consider other possibilities, to read for ourselves, although any reading we make is perhaps equally fictive, equally (mis)directed. (30) In Voyage au centre de la terre. reading also implies looking critically at the landscape, probing into the cracks of the stratified narrative. A 'critical' reading of this kind reveals that neither Axel's tale (the elaboration of a day-dream) nor Lidenbrock's commentary (the transformation of natural phenomena into scientific evidence) is to be trusted; they manipulate our response as readers without blinding us to their strategies of directed reading. It remains to be considered why two writers so disparate as Joseph Conrad and Jules Verne should share an interest in the intangible centre and in the implications of a reading of landscape which restricts itself to surfaces, perpetuating a circularity of narrative without locating a centre of significance. Michel Butor has suggested that the poetics of circularity which underpins Verne's work has a threefold historical basis: in nineteenth-century evolutionary theory, with its interest in the retracing of origins; positivism, with its aspirations towards 'total', all-embracing knowledge; and geographical exploration, with its compulsion towards manifestations of the superlative: centres, poles,</page><page sequence="22">- AO - peaks, etc. (31) Conrad's work is also clearly influenced by these historical phenomena in its celebration of geographical exploration (together with a critique of its commercial backlash), its reaction against positivist doctrine and its sceptical inquiry into evolutionism. Of the three areas, geography has received the least attention. This is unfortunate, particularly since, as I have suggested, a strong case may be made out for both Conrad and Verne as practitioners of the roman d'aventure, a genre which explicitly uses geographical principles to underpin its fictional practices. Voyage au centre de la terre was written in the hey-day of, and Heart of Darkness at the tail-end of,the Age of Exploration,whose underlying geographical principle, the conquest of space, could also be traced in the discoveries of the new technology, the expansionist policies of imperialism, and the deterministic chains of the human sciences. (32) The dominant intellectual development of the nineteenth century, however, according to Michel Foucault, was the emergence of the figure of Man, which gave rise to an analysis of the nature of human knowledge 'qui en de*terminait les formes et qui pouvait en meme temps lui e*tre manifested dans ses propres contenus empiriques' (33) and, concurrently, an analysis of the history of human knowledge 'qui pouvait a* la fois etre donne*e au savoir empirique et lui prescrire ses formes' (MC.p.330). The geography of Voyage au centre de la terre and Heart</page><page sequence="23">- 41 - of Darkness mediates between these two analyses: first, by implying that Nature pre-dates/pre-determines the forms of s history of human knowledge by functioning as a non-verbal, 'unconscious' origin of human knowledge (a phenomenology of the subject); and, second, by indicating that, in converting Nature into landscape, man has applied his knowledge to the promotion or expansion of a culture which seeks empirical evidence of its validity (a science of the object). The co-existence of these two tendencies in the work of Conrad and Verne, which also constitutes a tension between them, leads to a questioning not only of the validity of empirical procedures which lay claim to discover or uncover 'truths' but also of the existence of an origin or centre of significance to which such 'truths' might refer for their verification. This critique may be alternatively located in three areas which pertain to the conversion of Nature into land scape: first, in the physical superimposition of the cultural agent onto the natural environment; second, in the transference of the linguistic value of the transcendental signified onto the level of the cultural signifier; and third, in the epistemological reduction of a 'nature' of human knowledge to an 'archaeology', or cultural history, of human knowledge. Such conversions implicit in our revised readings of the cultural landscapes in Voyage au centre de la terre and Heart of Darkness reveal an epistemological insecurity at</page><page sequence="24">- 42 - the basis of each work which expresses itself in the desire to protect, preserve and perpetuate a system of values which is simultaneously considered as, at best, questionable and, at worst,, untenable. Similarly, the exclusivity of the cultural imperative which, proceeding from a rationalization of the object, produces a radical "split between (perceiving/ 'controlling') subject and (perceived/'controlled') object, is redefined as a split within the subject: the discourse of the other which might be construed as a privileging of the self (Kurtz, Lidenbrock) is thus traced back to nothing less than a duplicity of self. (34) In this context, our revision of the primary readings of landscape undertaken in the novels enables us to identify 'landscape' as a false, or at least an unstable, textual/ cultural construction which, tested for cracks and crevices, soon reveals the shakiness of its foundations. The suggestion that barbarity might underlie the veneer of civilization or that chaos might lurk beneath the ordered patterns of a language of proposition counters Marsh's contemporary claim that 'man cannot subsist and rise to the full development of [his] higher priorities unless brute and unconscious nature be effectively combatted' (Ml?,p.38) by entertaining the possibility that the brute exists not outside, but inside man. To read the landscape therefore ultimately entails the recognition of misconceived authority; it also hints, perhaps, at the inevitably misconceived authority of our own readings.

See also Terry Eagleton's notion that the critical reader 'speaks the silences' of a text in T. Eagleton, Marxism and Literary Criticism (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1976). Says Eagleton: 'It is in the significant silences of a text, in its gaps and absences, that the presence of ideology can be most positively felt. It is these silences which the critic must make speak. The text is, as it were, ideologically forbidden to say certain things.' (p. 34)</page><page sequence="27">- 45 - 14.

Marlow's universalized narrative disguises, or at least displaces, the economic motives of his journey. Msny of the so-called mysteries' of Hesrt of Darkness are due not to the inscrutability of Nature but to the reticence of Marlow, who, well aware of his complicity in and financial dependence on the imperial 'mission', conceals as much as he reveals. 24.
