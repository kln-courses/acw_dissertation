<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE QUINITY OF WINCHESTER ERNST H. KANTOROWICZ Note. For the kind permission to reproduce Figures 7, 10, II, 35, I wish to express my thanks to the British Museum, to the Very Reverend The Dean of Winchester, and to Dr. Erwin Rosenthal, at Berkeley. My thanks are due also to Professors Walter J. Fischel and George H. Williams, at Berkeley; to Mr. T. D. Kendrick of the British Museum; to the Frick Art Reference Library in New York; to the Index of Christian Art at Princeton; and to the War- burg Institute in London, for information, suggestions, and courte- sies. Finally I am greatly indebted to Mr. Francis Wormald, of the British Museum, for valuable information and suggestions, for several manuscript photographs, and for calling my attention to the Trinity in the Harley Manuscript. WRITTEN between 1012 and 1020 A.D., the manuscript of the Officia of the New Minster has long been appreciated as a remarkable speci- men of the Winchester School of painting. Among other illustrations, the manuscript contains a most puzzling draw- ing which, though generally known for thirty years or more, has not yet received the attention that this strange image deserves.' Only one student of art, hitherto, has made a serious effort to explain the meaning of this repre- sentation.2 His suggestions, however, go far astray and have failed to hit the mark, mainly because the subject has been treated as an isolated phenomenon, regardless of the parallels in contemporaneous imagery. The drawing (Fig. I) belongs to the Officium Trini- tatis.3 But instead of showing an image of the Holy Trinity, as might well be expected, the artist has produced an astounding medley of divine figures. Prominence has been given, undoubtedly, to two almost identical male figures, which occupy the right half and the center of the little image. The head of each is surrounded by a cruci- form-halo. Each holds a book in his left hand while the right hand indicates that a sprightly conversation is being carried on. They are evidently God the Father and God the Son. The Son is seated at the right hand of the Father, a posture which accords with the texts of many a prayer and many a passage of the New Testament, and which, of course, is authorized by the first verse of Psalm 109 (I Io). The Son occupies the center of the image. The Virgin Mary is seen at his right hand, an appropriate place when we think of the numerous legends of Mary's Assumption and her Coronation in Heaven. Here, however, such scenes are not yet alluded to. Their illustration belongs to an altogether later period.4 The Winchester drawing shows Mary holding in her right arm the Infant Jesus, who is distinguished by a little cruciform-halo and a book in his left hand. The rhetorical gesture of his right hand mani- fests his participation in the dialogue which is being carried on between the Father and the Son. Mary is without a halo. She wears a crown which almost serves as a nest for the dove seated on her head. The dove, the Holy Ghost, also has the cruciform-halo, a symbol which thus, very oddly, appears four times in the drawing. The group of five persons is framed by a studded circu- lar aureole. Within that circle we find God the Father, the Son, and the Virgin seated on a similarly studded semi- circular vault which indicates the celestial globe. Here the vault serves, as indeed it often does, as a celestial throne, a bench-throne which unites the main figures. The feet of Christ rest on a shackled and wriggling figure, Lucifer, whose body cuts through the lower part of the circular aureole of heaven. In the depth below, the fanged jaws of Hell are wide open and ready to devour him. The infernal jaws, of course, are below the circle of the celestial sphere; and so are the two personages who are squeezed, right and left, into the spandrels of the underworld. They are Judas and Arius, according to the inscriptions. Both are naked, and their feet shackled. Judas has a crook in his left hand, perhaps a reminder of his forfeited office of apostle.5 Were it not for the left group - Mary, the Infant Jesus, and the dove - we would readily call the image an illustration of the first verse of Psalm 109 ( Io): "The Lord said unto my Lord: Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool." However, what the artist shows is not the Two Persons of Psalm o09, so to speak, the "Binity," which is often depicted (Figs. 4-7, 9, lo),6 nor even the Trinity, which in later times, though 1.

In addition to the Utrecht and Canterbury Psalters (Figs.</page><page sequence="2">74 THE ART BULLETIN without proper reason, frequently illustrates that Psalm (Figs. 10o, 34).7 It is a Quaternity of God the Father, the Son, St. Mary, and the Holy Ghost; or, if we add the In- fant on the lap of the Virgin, we face the seemingly unique representation of what logically must be called a "Quin- ity." It is strange enough to find the Virgin seated on one throne with the Trinity, and it is a most unusual composi- tion at that early date when the cult of Mary was not yet at its climax and when even the familiar Coronation of the Virgin, or her throne-sharing with Christ, was as yet icono- graphically undeveloped.8 In fact, we have to go on to the fifteenth century to meet another Map(a Cvepovoc, a Vir- gin sharing the throne with the Trinity. One of the few specimens of a genuine "Quaternity" is found, for example, in the Book of Hours of Jean sans Peur, Duke of Bur- gundy; and the very competent editor of the manuscript has rightly stressed the extraordinary composition of that minia- ture (Fig. 12).' The crowned Virgin appears there as the central figure on the celestial throne. She is seated between God the Father at her right side and the Son at her left, a place reminiscent almost of the "theology" of the Emperor Julian, who styled the Great Mother the synthronos of Zeus, and Helios, the synthronos of the Mother.lo In the Franco-Burgundian miniature the Holy Spirit seems to be missing. However, around the three sharers of the celestial throne there floats, or rather flows, a belt-like circle which is doubtless supposed to represent the Spirit. In that case, the Third Person of the Trinity envelops the three sharers of the throne equally, whereas in the Winchester drawing the Holy Spirit seems to be attached exclusively to the Virgin. He becomes, as it were, one with her. This unity of the Virgin with the Spirit has prompted a far-fetched interpretation of the figure.11 It has been as- sumed that the drawing betrays the influence of Early Christian doctrines, according to which the Holy Ghost was considered as female, nay, as the Mother of Christ. It is true that in several gnostic writings the Spirit appears as a woman; and an echo of this doctrine is found still in the Didascalia Apostolorum, in which the bishop is said to take vicariously the place of God the Father, and the deacon that of the Son, whereas the Holy Ghost is said to be represented by the deaconess.12 Most of those doctrines - unknown or 2, 3) see Fig. 4, the Officia of Westminster (Maidstone Museum MS, fol. 32v), published by E. G. Millar, "Les principaux MSS a peinture du Lambeth Palace ' Londres," Bulletin de la socie'dt frangaise de reproduction de MSS a peintures, 8e Annbe, Paris, 1924, pl.

Figs. 5 and 6; also Fig. 7, the matrix of the seal of Godwin the Minister (eleventh century), in the British Museum; see 0. M. Dalton, Catalogue of the Ivory Carvings of the Christian Era . . . in the . . . British Museum, London, 1909, p. 32 f., No. 31~ A. Goldschmidt, Die Elfenbein- skulpturen, Berlin, 1926, IV, pp. 19 ff.; and M. H. Longhurst, English Ivories, London, 1926, pp. 10o, 74 ff., who with Dalton stresses the relationship with the Winchester Offices and the Utrecht Psalter, but styles that representation of Psalm lo9 a "Holy Trin- ity trampling on Sin." The assumption is that a small piece of ivory, which is broken away above the heads, displayed the dove. However, Mr. T. D. Kendrick, of the British Museum, has been kind enough to inspect the seal once more and to inform me that he does not think it is possible to identify with certainty the object above the two heads. The mutilation is regrettable, since the God- win seal might have represented our earliest Western evidence of a Trinity with dove formed on the basis of Psalm Io9 (iio). For the seal itself, see also F. Wormald, "The Seal of Nectan," Journal of the IWarburg Institute, II, 1938-1939, p. 70, and pl. I3e. 7. The Belgrade Psalter (Fig. 34; Belgrade, Nat. Libr. MS, fol. 189) is of course very late, but it may have preserved an earlier iconographical type; cf. J. Strzygowski, "Die Miniaturen des serbischen Psalters in Miinchen," Abhandlungen der kaiserlichen Akademie in Wien, LII, 190o6, p. 57, fig. 26; cf. pl. xxxvII, fig. 85, for the Serbian Psalter in Munich, where Christ, sitting on the left side of the Father, is seen with the dove in his lap. Cf. A. Baum- stark, "Friihchristlich-syrische Psalterillustrationen in einer by- zantinischen Abkiirzung," Oriens Christianus, v, I905, p. 313, for the introduction of the dove into illustrations of Psalm lo9 (io). The Princeton Index of Christian Art files, as the earliest evidence of this type, the Gospel Book of Pembroke College, Cam- bridge, of the early twelfth century (MS 120o, fol. 6) ; M. R. James, A Descriptive Catalogue of the Manuscripts in the Library of Pembroke College, CambridLge, Cambridge, 1905, p. 124. See, however, below, p. 77. In the Winchester Bible (Fig. io), the Trinity illustrates the so-called Gallican version of the psalm and alludes to the "Messianic" interpretation; the Hebrew version (right), showing two kings, may render the "historical" inter- pretation (cf. Fig. 5). Messianic and historical interpretations were interlaced and exchangeable anyhow. When the king entered into a city or visited a monastery, the verse Dixit Dominits (Ps. lo9: 1) was sung at Vespers, indicating that the historic event was conceived in the light of the prophecy, or that the messianic prom- ise had become "history" at the king's advent. See the Antiphonae de susceptione regum (to which Mr. W. A. Chaney has kindly called my attention) in the gallicized Liber responsalis, in Migne, Patrologia Latina, LXXVIII, col. 828C, and ART BULLETIN, XXVI, 1944, pp. 208-2Io. Mr. W. Oakeshott, The Artists of the Winchester Bible, London, 1945, p. I6 (cf. pl. xxxvIII) dates the design "ca. I2Io." 8. See Marion Lawrence, "Maria Regina," ART BULLETIN, VII, 1925, p. 156.

Mingana, Manchester,</page><page sequence="3">THE QUINITY OF WINCHESTER 75 unnoticed during the Middle Ages--appear irrelevant to the Winchester drawing. However, one well-known patristic work, St. Jerome's Expositions on the Prophets, should probably be accounted for. For here, in fact, the Saint quotes the Aramaic Gospel of the Ebionites and ad- duces from this source, which has been looked upon as the original version of the Gospel of St. Matthew, the curious sentence "modo tulit me mater mea spiritus sanctus in uno capillorum meorum." But the scholarly Jerome explains also that there is no reason for feeling scandalized at the phrase "Just now my Mother the Holy Spirit has carried me by one hair (to Mount Tabor)," since in Hebrew and Aramaic the word for "spirit" (ruach, rucha) is female just as it is a neuter in Greek (pneuma), and male in Latin. But, says Jerome, this makes no difference, and he adds rather daringly: In divinitate nullus est sexus."3 No doubt Jerome's Expositions were known in England as well as on the Continent. But there is no reason to be- lieve that the Winchester master has borrowed his inspira- tion for representing the oneness of the Spirit with Mary from Jerome or, through him, from a gnostic source. The Winchester drawing actually does not require any gnostic interpretation. It can be explained most satisfactorily from its own environment and direct sources, among which, it is true, St. Jerome will turn out to be of major importance. It is obvious that the group of the Virgin Mary, the In- fant, and the dove has been tacked onto the other two figures without an original inner connection. Admittedly, the artist has succeeded marvellously in bracing and en- livening the scene. The Infant argues, Mary listens atten- tively, and only the dove appears incommunicative. Yet, there is no question that the "Binity," Father and Son, forms the original nucleus of the image. From these two figures, therefore, the interpretation must start. The model of the Binity is found in the Utrecht Psalter (Fig. 2), or in one of its derivations, among which the MS Harley 603 is perhaps of a date earlier than the Winchester drawing.'4 The divergences of the drawing from its model are relatively insignificant. In the Utrecht Psalter the two figures illustrating Psalm lo9 are youthful and beardless; in the Winchester drawing both are bearded, whereas in the Canterbury Psalter, a twelfth-century copy of the Utrecht Psalter, the Son alone has a beard (Fig. 3).15 Moreover, in the Psalters, both Utrecht and Canterbury, the left figure, the Son, alone has a cruciform-halo, and only the right figure with plain halo is seated on the celes- tial globe, whereas the left is seated on a bench (Fig. 2) or on a rounded throne with low back and armrests (Fig. 3). Also the feet of the cross-nimbed figure rest on two ene- mies, whereas the figure in the Winchester drawing makes only one enemy, Lucifer, his footstool. We have to concentrate, for a moment, on the haloes as represented in the Psalters. The distinction between cross-haloed and plain-haloed divinities is anything but un- usual, or clear, in the Utrecht Psalter. Whatever may have been the reason for thus distinguishing between the divine persons in the other drawings of that Psalter (and it might be worth while investigating the matter), in the model of the Winchester drawing the cause is a curious, though very common, interpretation of the first words of Psalm og9: "The Lord said unto my Lord." Usually the Lord that speaks would be considered as God the Father, and the Lord spoken to, either as King David - the "his- torical" interpretation (Figs. 5, io) - or as Christ - the "messianic" interpretation (Figs. 4, 6, 7, 9, Io).'* The difference was not too great, since David himself was "messianic" and was both the ancestor and prefiguration of Christ. The commentators on the Psalm, therefore, hold that David and Christ are almost exchangeable here. "Qui filius Dei est, ipse et filius David est," writes Jerome. And St. Augustine explains, "Filius David secundum carnem, dominus David secundum divinitatem; sic Mariae filius secundum carnem et Mariae dominus secundum maiesta- tem."' The Utrecht Psalter, however, does not make the 1920, II, pp. 384 f., and J. H. Bernard, "The Odes of Solomon," Journal of Theological Studies, xII, I911, p. 28 (where, how- ever, the Order of Severus should be ruled out). Further, J. A.

The variant "Videbitis Regem regum procedentem a matre (instead of a Patre)" in the Magnificat antiphon In nativitate Domini, which is found in some manuscripts of the Breviary, does not refer to the Holy Spirit at all, but to the Virgin; see Anselm Manser, "Christk6nigsziige im r6mischen und benediktinischen Adventsgottesdienst," Heilige Oberlieferung (Festschrift fiir Abt Ildefons Herwegen, ed. O. Casel), Miinster i.W., 1938, p. 133. 14. E. T. De Wald, The Illustrations of the Utrecht Psalter, Princeton, 1932, pl. cI (fol. 64v). The Harley MS 603, fol. 56", is a faithful copy of the Utrecht Psalter. I5. M. R. James, The Canterbury Psalter, London, 1935, fol. i99g, and p. 37. The description offered by the editor ("the Father on a throne and the Son with book on a rainbow i under the Father's [!] feet are two prostrate enemies") is hardly correct, since it disagrees with the text of the Psalm. The enemies form the footstool of the Son, who sits practically always at the right side of the Father. For an exception (Serbian Psalter; above, n. 7), see the suggestions of Baumstark, op. cit., p. 3 7. i6. For the "historical" conception, see, in addition to (Fig. io) the Winchester Bible (above, n. 7), also (Fig. 5) the Lut- trell Psalter (fol. 203), ed. by E. G. Millar, London, 1932, pl. 158. See also Fig. 33, the Jerusalem Psalter (infra, n. 20o). In the Chludoff Psalter- Moscow MS 129, fol. I i -a photostat of which I owe to the kindness of the Frick Art Reference Library in New York, David stands before the throne of Christ, and the Divine Hand, emanating rays, stretches downwards from heaven. The underlying idea, quite foreign to the West, is very similar to that represented in the Jerusalem Psalter. I7. Hieronymus, Tractatus in Librum Psalmorum, cix, ed. G.

In other words, the plain-haloed figure is not God the Father but the youthful Filius Dei, co-equal with the Father,"8 who receives as his throne-sharer in heaven the cross-haloed and likewise youthful Filius David, the in- carnate Christ. The difference is accentuated also by the seat. The Filius Dei is seated on the celestial globe as King of the Universe; the incarnate Filius David sits on a throne.'" Christ secundum quod Deus, addressing Christ secun- dum, quod homo and bidding the latter to sit down at his right side, may appear as a strange fashion of interpreting the phrase "Dixit Dominus Domino meo." However, ac- cording to the patristic and other authorities, this duplica- tion of the Second Person is correct. It is soundly based upon the various glosses explaining the psalm. The gloss, added to Psalm Io9 in the Canterbury Psalter and phrased apparently after the text of the Glossa ordinaria, even be- gins with the summary Materia est Christus secundum utramque naturam. Moreover, in the explanation follow- ing thereafter, the human nature of the one seated at the right side of the one whose nature is divine is stressed time and time again.2 In essence, the gloss goes back here to the authority of St. Jerome. He was probably the first au- thor within the Latin tradition to emphasize that the throne-sharing Jesus was not Christ secundum divinitatem - who, of course, held the throne of heaven from eter- nity - but Christ secundum humanitatem, who rose from the dead and ascended in the flesh.21 This uncanny duplication of the Second Person of the Trinity - rare in Western and very common in later Eastern art22 - has been adopted not only by the Master of the Utrecht Psalter but also by that of the Winchester Officia. It is evident, however, that the concept of the double nature of Christ had to be modified by the Winches- ter artist, since the subject he wished to illustrate was not Psalm og9, but the Office of the Trinity. In a Trinity, God the Father could not well be absent nor could he be represented vicariously by the co-equal Son. The artist, therefore, when adjusting himself to the new task, quite obviously had to face certain difficulties. We have to bear in mind that in the early eleventh cen- tury the representation of a Trinity was a relatively new and uncommon topic. Popular enough, it is true, were the symbolic Trinities showing, say, in connection with the Baptism, the divine hand in the clouds, the descending dove, and Jesus in the Jordan. But an "anthropomorphic" Trinity was, iconographically, as yet a type almost un- known in the West. To be sure, anthropomorphic Trini- ties were not lacking entirely, and it is quite surprising to find that most of the early efforts in that direction were carried out by Anglo-Saxon artists.23 Nevertheless, of the LXX, col. 793, and Beda, Retractatio in Actus Apostolorum, ii, 34, ed. M. L. W. Laistner, Bedae Venerabilis Expositio Actuum Aposto- lorum et Retractatio, Cambridge, Mass., 1939, p. Io04. i8. For reasons of convenience, and in accordance with the Princeton Index of Christian Art, De Wald, in his edition of the Utrecht Psalter (p. 5, n. 3), styles the Christ before the Incarna- tion the "Christ-Logos." Except in a symbolical form (Hand of God, etc.), God the Father is not represented in the Utrecht Psalter. He is replaced by the co-equal Christ-Logos, who thus becomes the Creator God, in full agreement with the general christocentric con- cepts prevalent during the earlier Middle Ages 5 see, for an Anglo- Saxon example in a very prominent place, the Laws of King Al- fred, Introductio, ?3, ed. Felix Liebermann, Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen, Halle, 1903-1916, I, pp. 26 f.: "on VI dagum Crist geworhte heofonas 7 eorban." By the twelfth century, the Trinity occasionally replaces the Creator Christ-Logos. See, for the general problem, Adelheid Heimann, "Trinitas Creator Mundi," Journal of the Warburg Institute, II, 1938-1939, pp. 42 ff., 45, n. 4, whose article "L'Iconographie de la Trinit6," L'art chritien, I, I934, has not been accessible to me. 19. The sharing of one bench-throne is found more frequently than the enthronement on two different seats. The two seats are equal (Fig. 6) in the Stuttgart Psalter (fol. I27v), ed. by E. T. De Wald, Princeton, i930. The difference of the seats is strongly accentuated in a Greek Psalter (Fig. 33) at Jerusalem of ca. 1053- o1054 - Hagios Taphos MS 53, fol. i62z - published by Baum- stark, in Oriens Chzistianus, v, pl. vii, i, and pp. 316 ff. The Father is represented by the etoimasia, the "empty" throne with back and armrests, whereas Christ, the Domninus of the kneeling David, sits on a throne without back. In the Albani Psalter, the Father is seated on a globe and points with his hand at an empty throne at his right side; see Adolph Goldschmidt, Der Albanipsalter in Hildesheim, Berlin, 1895, p. 120. 20. James, Canterbury Psalter, p. 3, claims that a great body of the glosses in that psalter is taken from "the 9th century (and earlier) Glossa ordinaria." See, however, on the Glossa ordinaria, Beril Smalley, The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages, Oxford, 1941, pp. 31 ff., 39 ff., and her fully justified doubts as to the date of the Glossa and Walahfrid Strabo's "authorship." It is interesting to note, with regard to the general christological changes develop- ing during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, that the Two- Natures interpretation of Psalm o09, so basic with the early com- mentators, is almost without interest to the expositors of the psalm from the twelfth century onwards. See, for the earlier interpreters, in addition to Jerome, Augustine (Enarratio in Psalmos, cix), and Cassiodorus (supra, n. 17), also Pseudo-Bede, In Psalmorum Librum Exegesis, in Migne, Patrologia latina, xcIII, col. xo33 (on the authorship of this work, see M. L. W. Laistner, A Hand-List of Bede Manuscripts, Ithaca, N.Y., 1943, p. 159); and for the later commentaries, e.g., Petrus Lombardus, in Migne, Patrologia latina, cxci, col. 997, or Honorius Augustod., ibid., cxciv, col. 693 (among the works of Gerhoh of Reichersperg). 21.

It was ac- cepted also in the East; see loannes Chrysostomos, In Ascensionem, c.3, Migne, Patrologia graeca, L, col. 446. See also Theodore of Mopsuestia, whose interpretation of Psalm io9 is known through the medium of Cosmas Indicopleustes, Topographia, v (Migne, Patrologia graeca, LXXXVIII, cols. 254 f.), and who in some re- spects agrees with the conventional exegesis, although in this Psalm (as in Psalms 2, 8, and 44) he sees his opportunity for stressing most emphatically a succession in time of the divine after the hu- man nature; cf.

The three male figures, seated on one throne, repre- sent a type that can be traced back to the Coptic circle of art, to the sixth century or, perhaps, the seventh.25 The type of the two synthronoi with the dove between them is found in the somewhat archaic Belgrade Psalter (Fig. 34, and above, n. 7) which, though itself late mediaeval, is credited with representing a tradition of long standing. This is certainly correct in view of the non-Christian tradition. Not to mention specimens antedating the Chris- tian era, there is a famous and frequently discussed Egyp- tian amulet of the British Museum, belonging to the first or second century after Christ, which forms an early repre- sentation of that pattern of triune deity (Fig. 20).26 Moreover, certain "prototypes" as developed by the im- perial art of the later Roman Empire have to be accounted for. The synthronismoi of two or three emperors, frontally aligned, are commonly known (Figs. 18, 19), and their relationship to later images of the Trinity, though hitherto uninvestigated, is almost self-evident (cf. Fig. 8).2"7 But it has hardly been emphasized in this connection that large numbers of gold coins, of a date as late as the Theodosian era, are available showing the imperial throne-partners in the unity of a winged demon. For we see the two em- perors, not with a dove, but with another "bird," a Vic- toria, floating between their haloed (Fig. 22), or simply diademed (Fig. 21), heads and, on some coin issues, even ready to crown them (Fig. 23). Nor has an early speci- men of this type, a medallion issued by the Dyarchy, at- tracted attention, although it actually displays a god with his human-imperial incarnation, his co-ruler and syn- thronos, at his right side and with a Victory hovering above and between them --Hercules with Diocletian's col- league Maximian, the first Augustus of the Herculian dynasty (Fig. 24).28 How easily those types were translated into the lan- guage of Christian imagery is strikingly disclosed by a gold medallion of the emperor Constans with his brother Con- stantius II, which recently has been published for the first time (Fig. 25). The two emperors, both in "liturgical" attire and both haloed, are enthroned as usual, though turned to each other as if in conversation. Only the divinity has been changed; for between their heads there now hovers, not the Victoria as unifier, but the Christogram, the R of Constantine's labarum. The intrinsic value of the image is still the same as before, a manifestation of the imperial glory and triumph. But the emperors, formerly bound together in unitate Victoriae, now appear as one in unitate victoriae Christi, since the victorious Christ has taken the place of Victory to secure, now as ever, the em- perors' triumph over the barbarae gentes.29 (see, e.g., Heimann, "Trinitas creator mundi," p. 43) and a per- haps dubious one in a Lorsch MS, to which the explanation of "Trinity" has been added by another, if contemporary, hand (Bibl. Vat., MS Pal. Lat. 834, fol. 28; cf. A. Goldschmidt, Ger- man Illumination, Florence and Paris, 1928, 1, pl. 61), the oldest Western anthropomorphic Trinities turn out to have originated in England: the one in the Sherborne Pontifical (Paris, Bibl. Nat. lat. MS 943, fols. 5', 6, 6~; see Leroquais, Les pontificaux manuscrits des bibliothkques publiques de France, Paris, 1937, pls. viii-x) ; another in the British Museum, Harley MS 603, fol. I (see be- low); and a third, of ca. I050 A.D., in the Psalter of Bury St. Ed- mund's (Vat. Regin. MS lat. I2, fol. 88), for the knowledge of which I am indebted to the friendliness of Mr. F. Wormald. 24. For Fig. 8, see infra, n. 69; and for Fig. Io, supra, n. 7. 25. The claim of Miss Heimann, "Trinitas creator mundi," p. 46, as to the "Byzantine," that is, Eastern origin of this Trinity, is doubtless correct. However, the Trinity in the Homilies of the Monk James (see, e.g., H. Omont, in Bulletin de la socie'te' fran- raise de reproduction de MSS, xIe ann6e, pl. xix), usually consid- ered as the earliest evidence for the three throned figures, has ante- cedents which I intend to discuss in another connection. 26.

Here the "survival by transfer- ence" of the coin images can be grasped almost at a glance, even though the throned figures themselves have been ex- changed, and not only the unifying deity. Roman martyrs, preferably Peter and Paul, the Roman apostles, are the favorite figures displayed by the gold-glasses. Sometimes their busts are shown facing each other, sometimes the fig- ures in full sit on chairs. As the "unifier" hovering above the apostles' heads there may be seen, similar to the im- perial medallion, the Christogram (Fig. 26 a), or a large crown (Fig. 26 b); or the two symbols might be combined so that the sacred characters are surrounded by the knotted wreath of immortality (Fig. 26 c). On other glasses, the unifier is Christ himself, "coming on the clouds of heaven" and ready to crown his martyrs with, says Prudentius, the corona civica aeternae curiae, the crown of the kingdom beyond and of the martyrs and saints (Fig. 26 d).31 Gone are the Caesars. Their successors are the Roman apostles and martyrs, crowned rulers and Caesars of the second Rome - a highly suggestive illustration and most faithful mirroring of Prudentius' verses, of the sermons of Pope Leo the Great, and of the spirit which, half a millennium later, dictated O Roma nobilis and the cycle of related poems. One gold-cup, however, rouses our attention in particu- lar. Its general design (Fig. 26 d) is traditional: two seated figures with the plain-haloed Christus coronator hovering above and between them. According to the inscriptions, the figure to the right is the Protomartyr St. Stephen, and the one to the left is Christ. No doubt, the latter, in- deed, is meant to be Christ; the teacher's scroll in his left hand and the quartered globe at his feet duly justify the inscription. It is startling, however, that Christ should ap- pear twice in the same image. He is, at the same time, the one who crowns and who is crowned, who imposes the crown on the martyrs and who receives it as the martys synthronos of the Protomartyr. For Christ himself is the "faithful and true martyr" according to the Johannine writings (Apoc. 1:2, 5; 3:14, 15; John 18:37), and his alignment with Stephen, therefore, makes perfect sense. Yet, the image has perplexed modern scholars, who usu- ally assumed an error on the part of the artist and re- jected the possibility "che egli (il Salvatore) incoroni se stesso." However, to Early Christian minds a concept such as "He that crowneth and is crowned, that imposeth the crown and receiveth it" would have come most natural; and a similar idea is expressed very strongly in the By- zantine liturgies (below, p. 83). Even in the light of the Utrecht Psalter and the Winchester drawing the possibil- ity of a "reduplication" of Christ in imagery should not be ruled out; rather should it be accepted that the Christ Son-of-Man is crowned here by the haloed Christ Son-of- God or Christ-Logos.32 In the design of the gold-glass, at last, the figure of Christ has been included in that ancient scheme of the two throned figures with a third hovering in the heights above and between them. The next step, however, was long de- layed. For a corresponding arrangement of the Holy Trin- ity, reflecting, as it were, the doxology Qui tecum vivit et regnat with the ensuing in unitate Spiritus sancti, does not seem to occur in Western art before the beginning of the twelfth century.33 At any rate, to the master of the Winchester drawing this scheme must have been unknown. In his effort to pro- duce a Trinity, therefore, he could not yet rely upon an established pattern of his subject. He had to develop his scheme more or less by himself on the basis of the imagery then known, and known to him. He chose a very suit- parallel: St. Demetrius of Thessalonica as throne-sharer of Manuel Angelos, Emperor of Thessalonica; cf. Longuet, "Deux monnaies de Manuel l'Ange Comnine Ducas, empereur de Thessalonique (1230-1262)," Revue numismatique, vol. vii, ve ser., 1943, p. 138. The function of Victory has been taken over here by St. Michael, who in full military attire is displayed on the obverse. 30. See, for France, P. le Gentilhomme, "Trouvaille de mon- naies d'or des M6rovingiens et des Wisigoths," Revue de la numis- matique, 4e ser., vol. xxxIX, 1936, pl.

Belaiew, "On the Geographical Distribution of the Sceattas," Seminarium Konda- kovianum, vIII, 1936, pl. VII, Io; cf. p. 217. 31. See for Figs. 26 a-d, R.

Goodenough, "The Crown of Victory in Judaism," ART BULLETIN, XXVIII, 1946, pp. 139-159, especially 150 ff. 32. Garrucci, op. cit., II, pp. 165 ff., claims that the inscription has been displaced and that the figure to the left was meant to be St. Laurence; Hermann Vopel, Die altchi-istlicken Goldgldser (Arc/iiologische Studien zum christlichen Altertum und Mittelal- ter, v), Freiburg, 1899, P. 54, believes that the artist simply stuck to the traditional pattern of representing Christus coronator even though this clich6 did not fit the actual design. Much more correct is the opinion (quoted by Vopel, p. 54, n. 4) of W. Smith and S. Cheetham, Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, London, 188o, II, p. 1399, who consider one figure as Christ the teacher on earth, whereas "the other shows Him as seen by St. Stephen in vision from heaven." 33.

There was but one pitfall. Through the agency of this model in the Utrecht conception, the idea of the "double nature" crept into his design. It thrust itself upon the artist, al- though the difficult problem utriusque naturae, all by it- self, had nothing to do with a Trinity. However, the artist deviated from his model. In the Winchester drawing the "double nature" is not reflected in the group to the right, in the Two Persons, where this feature is found in the Utrecht Psalter. For in the drawing the two male figures are not distinguished from one another. They both have cruciform-haloes; they are seated together on one bench; and the divine Son, now bearded like the Father, has be- come the peer of the Father instead of assimilating him- self to the youthful type of his own incarnation. Since the group to the right represented, quite obviously, the Father and the divine Son, the Winchester master, to solve his problem, moved the representation of the "double na- ture," as it were, to the left, that is, he added to the "Bin- ity" of the Psalter model the left group: Mary with the Infant Jesus and the dove. It may be mentioned immediately that this left group was a result of the artist's own inventive imagination as little as that of the "Binity." That additional subject, too, was borrowed from the Utrecht Psalter. To identify the model, we have to turn to those liturgical formulae which allude to Psalm 109 and to the Son's throne-partnership with the Father: to the Gloria ("Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris") and the Apostles' Creed ("Ascendit ad coelos, sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris"). The illustrations of Gloria and Credo display, in the Utrecht Psalter (Figs. 13, 14) as well as in its derivations (Figs. 15, 16), the Virgin Mary approaching God on the throne of heaven, with the dove on her head (both without halo) and with the Infant (cross-haloed) in her arms. The editor of the Utrecht Psalter correctly has labelled each of those drawings as "Trinity," if a symbolical Trinity. Yet, on closer inspec- tion, one discovers that those "Trinities" illustrating Gloria and Credo are just as strange as the one in the Winchester Officia and that they, too, in fact, display "Quinities." The drawing illustrating the Gloria shows, in addition to the Father, and to Mary with the Infant Jesus and the dove, yet another symbol, the Lamb of the Apocalypse - with, or without, its victorious cross-staff - representing, as it were, Christ secundum quod Deus. And in the Credo illustration we find the Etoimasia, the "empty throne," prepared on a globe, which is also a symbol of the divine Christ (Figs. 14, 16; cf. Fig. 33). In other words, through the symbols of Lamb and Throne, both apocalyptic, the divinitas Christi appears to be indicated, whereas the hu- manitas Christi is represented, in both prayers, by the In- fant Jesus, the Incarnate, in the arms of his mother. When now we turn back to the Winchester drawing, it is easy for us to account for the artist's intentions, as well as for his models. The two Persons in the right section of the image represent the Father with the Son - the Son secundum dvminitatem and in his appearance the likeness of the Father. To produce a Trinity it would have been sufficient to add a dove. But this the artist, apparently, con- sidered as insufficient, because by the simple addition of the Holy Spirit to the "Binity" he would have ignored Christ secundum humanitatezm. He therefore contrived the ex- pedient of setting forth the human nature of Christ by representing the Incarnation itself: the Virgin Mother and, closely attached to her, the Holy Spirit. Hence, the throned Christus Deus and the Infant Jesus homo in the arms of Mary belong together; together they form, as it were, one Person, the divine and the incarnate Christ, that is, the "complete" Saviour secundum divinitatem and secundum humanitatem. The enigmatic character of the drawing thus derives from the artist's strange endeavor to show the Second Person in its two natures simultaneously. In fact, the whole group - the enthroned Christ, the Infant, and the Virgin - together form the Second Person of the Trinity, to which there has been added the Third Person, the dove. A few words may be said about the dove, which appears, to say the least, thoroughly uninterested in the sacra con- versazione of its co-equals. It turns its back toward that group. But it would be unjustified to charge the bird with impoliteness or even indifference. The dove, here a sym- bol also of the vehicle of the Incarnation, should be com- pared with similar representations, for instance, with the Annunciation in the Chludoff Psalter (Fig. 17), where the dove nests on St. Mary's head and halo in a manner similar to that of the Winchester drawing, that is, alight- ing from the right side."4 We may recall that in Early Christian art, in scenes of divine ascensions and descen- sions, the right side often indicates both "East" and "Heaven."3" This symbolism, however, has seemed inde- cisive to the master of the Utrecht Psalter (Figs. 13, 14; cf. Figs. 15, 16). In the Psalter, the dove's head is consistently turned toward the Infant Jesus, so that the direction of its bill simply depends upon whether the Child is carried in the right arm of the Virgin or in the left. In the Winchester drawing the Infant is in Mary's right arm - hence the dove turns its back to the group of Father and Son and seems to be occupied with Mary alone. This "oneness" of Mary and the dove refers to the Incarnation. There is no 34. J. J. Tikkanen, "Die Psalterillustrationen im Mittelalter," Acta Societatis Scientiarum Fennicae, xxx, 5, 1903, P. 49, fig. 63. The iconographic type, of course, is much older, as is illustrated by the gold-foils found in Mycenae and showing the goddess with the dove on her head; see H.

The originality of the Winchester master, on the whole, appears limited. It is restricted - if we except one item - to the combination of the Psalter illustrations of Psalm 109 with those of the Gloria and the Creed, which refer to that psalm. This, in itself, is a matter of major interest, since the fact that Psalm og9 is fundamental to the development of the iconography of the Trinity (Figs. 10, 34) has not yet been studied sufficiently.36 The connection of the Winchester drawing with Psalm Io9, however, is also revealing with regard to another de- tail. Only through the medium of that Psalm can we un- derstand the presence of the third group of figures in the image, the "enemies" serving the Son as a footstool. In the Utrecht Psalter (Fig. 2, also Figs. 3, 4, 9) the feet of the Dominus rest on two anonymous enemies, in full agree- ment with the text of the psalm. In the Winchester draw- ing there is but one enemy, Lucifer,37 whereas the ini- mici suffering in Hell form the "footstool" in a rather in- direct and detached fashion. Moreover, these enemies no longer are anonymous; they are named; they are Judas and Arius. It is true that Judas and Arius are sometimes put into parallel in theological writings.38 Yet, it is also true that the presence of Arius in the Officia of Winchester would remain obscure unless we realize that this figure is inspired quite plainly by the gloss, or glosses, to the Io9th Psalm. We have to remember that Psalm og9 had been in the very center of the struggles between the orthodox Chris- tians and the heterodox Arians. The orthodox champions had tried to prove the equality of the Son with the Father by calling upon the evidence of that Psalm, asserting that its words manifested the co-equality of the two synthronoi. The Arians, claiming the inferiority of the Son to the Father, ridiculed those alleged proofs. Mockingly they said that the metaphor of the Son sitting at the right side of the Father proved next to nothing; from this evidence one might as well deduce the superiority of the Son over the Father because qui est in dexteram, ipse est maior.39 To this St. Ambrose found it easy to reply: Divinitas gradus nescit.40 Still, the Arians continued to heckle and to mini- mize the significance of the throne-partnership as de- scribed in the Psalm. They claimed that according to the selfsame verse the Son shared the divine throne not as an equal but only because he had been "ordered" to do so - quia iussus sedet ad dexteram. And they concluded that the Father who ordered was greater than the Son who obeyed.41 In short, the Arians, though quite ready to acknowledge the mediatorship of the Son, refused to recognize a status of the Glorified co-equal with that of the Father. "Gloria Patri per Filium" was the wording of the Arian doxology which, though having an old tradition and orthodox back- ground, made the Orthodox gradually, as it were, "Per- conscious" and prompted them to emphasize all the more vigorously that the King of Glory shared the throne with God as a co-equal.42 The orthodox defense eventually re- sulted in an actual overstress of the God-equal kingship of the triumphant Christ at the expense, perhaps, of his priest- hood, a feature which was to impress itself deeply upon the whole development of Western civilization in both the Middle Ages and the age of the Reformation.43 Psalm Io9, at any rate, was in the center of the christo- logical discussions of the early Church, and it thus hap- pened that St. Jerome, too, took a stand in those disputes of his times. In his Commentary on Psalm I0o9,44 Jerome distinguishes between the two natures of Christ and as- serts that the words of the psalm were spoken to Christ the man, and not to Christ the God. 36. According to Tikkanen, op. cit., p. 213, n. 2, the contami- nation of the two subjects (psalm and Gloria or Creed) has been noticed already by J. O.

To him, who is man, who has been received into heaven, order is given to sit. This we are saying as against the Arians and those who maintain: "Greater is the Father, who orders him to sit, than the one, to whom that order is being given!" Hence, through the Commentary of Jerome the name of Arius came to be connected with Psalm og9 so closely that the reference to Arianism remained a permanent requisite in many of the later expositions on that psalm. It is, therefore, on the strength of Jerome's gloss, or of one of its derivatives, that the Winchester artist placed Arius as "enemy" under the foot of the Lord.45 Only through the gloss do we understand both features: (I) the presence of Arius in a Trinity and (2) the artist's urge to represent the two natures of Christ. The composition of the Winchester drawing, by now, has become perfectly conclusive. From Jerome's time- bound anti-Arian arguments in his Commentary on Psalm og9 there derived the figure of Arius; and in this respect the artist worked independently: Arius does not appear in the Utrecht Psalter. From the same gloss there further de- rived what may have appeared to the artist as a dogmatic necessity: the distinction between the humanitas and the divinitas of Christ. This distinction had been carried through already by the master of the Utrecht Psalter. However, in the Psalter the subject of the "two natures" had been indicated very discretely either by a halo-variant or by the introduction of the Lamb or the Throne, at any rate in a purely symbolical fashion. The Winchester mas- ter has by far outstripped his model. The topic of the two natures, which may have appeared to him as indispensable even in the picture of a Trinity, has been emphasized so forcefully that, in fact, the image might be taken to dis- play an antithesis rather than a synthesis of the God-Christ and His human manifestation. It might be held that the artist, involuntarily and cer- tainly optima fide, has depicted an almost "Nestorian" christology by splitting the two natures of Christ; his work, to be sure, is not in agreement with the "unsevered and unseparated" of Chalcedon or with the corresponding phrases of the Athanasian Creed. Also it might be held that his efforts to meet the requirements of St. Jerome's gloss have led him to introduce a Virgin Mary that ap- pears as a christotokos, mother of Christ, rather than a theotokos, Mother of God. The artist certainly did not wish to indicate a polarity of the two natures; but his at- tempt to illustrate the Officium Trinitatis on the basis of Psalm o109 has resulted in a garbled rendering of the triune Deity. He has produced a weird "Quinity," which - it may be mentioned by the way - is in no respect a fore- runner of the mariolatrous Quaternities of the later Mid- dle Ages. The "Quinity of Winchester," after all, is meant to be a Trinity, in fact so orthodox and anti-Arian a Trin- ity that it is on the verge of overbalancing the dogma and turning it to the contrary. The Winchester Trinity, though probably unique and without a true parallel, reflects nevertheless a rather broad and general artistic or human problem. The difficulty of representing at once the two natures and yet avoiding their, so to speak, "frontal" meeting in the same image has not really been mastered by the artist; it has led him to his quasi-"Nestorianism." This difficulty, however, is re- stricted to mediaeval and, for that matter, to Christian art in general, as little as the underlying problem itself. It all reappears with any representation of the two natures of any deified human being; and it all turns up unfailingly as soon as the divine, instead of being recognized as an immanent component of the human, begins to lead a life of its own - and vice versa. In this respect there has been much more of "Nestorianism" in history than might be assumed. Problems of that kind were known to some extent even in Greece where, for example, a divine Heracles was wor- shipped as distinct from Heracles the man and hero."4 "Those Greeks," writes Herodotus,47 "I think, are most in the right, who have established and practise two cults of Heracles, sacrificing to one Heracles as to an immortal and calling him the Olympian, but bringing offerings to the other as to a dead hero." This was a simple solution. A greater difficulty arose whenever and wherever the deity that received the honors was identical with the one who paid those honors as high priest or worshipper. The reliefs in the temple of Abu Simbel, in Nubia, show Ramses II, the king and therewith the head of all cults in Egypt, as he inaugurates his own sanctuary and worships his own im- age.4s This may appear as strange, or even ridiculous, to 45. See, e.g., Cassiodorus, in Migne, Patrologia latina, LXX, col. 794A, who forms one of the main sources of mediaeval psalter exegesis; or Beda, Expositio Actuum Apostolorum, II, 34, ed. Laistner, p. 2zo, lines 24 ff., who interprets Psalm io9:1, on the basis of Hieronymus, Commentarioli in Psalmos, ed. Morin, op. cit., III, I, p. 8o. This, I believe, clearly evidences that the "Nestorianism" of the Winchester artist results from a second- hand "anti-Arianism" rather than from a direct touch of Nes- torian doctrines. However, we should be aware of the fact that a subcurrent of Nestorian ideas, supplied by Theodore of Mopsuestia (above, n. 21) and, to a lesser degree, by Junilius Africanus was certainly permeating Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Psalter exegesisi see G. I. Ascoli, II codice Irlandese dell' Ambrosiana (Arc/zivio glotto- logico Italiano, v), Rome, 1878, and James W. Bright and Rob- ert L.

Baillet, Le re'gime pharaonique, Blois, 1912, I, p. 395; the difference does not appear as too great in this connection if really the king should worship only his Ka, as is suggested by Nock, "Zi~vvao O,6," Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, XLI, 1930, p. I4, n. i, since the representation of the Ka itself leads continuously to the "duplication" of a figure in imagery; see, e.g., Adolf Erman, Die Religion der itgypter, Berlin and Leipzig, 1934, PP. 54, 210.</page><page sequence="14">82 THE ART BULLETIN the modern mind; but we should be careful when applying such qualifications, even though they may be found in an- tique literature itself. Athenaeus, for instance, disapproves of Alexander the Great who, vested in the gods' attire and adorned with their insignia, received almost divine wor- ship and, at the same time, offered to them the sacrifices.49 Similar situations could turn up very easily in the Roman Empire: the emperor as Pontifex Maximus would offer sacrifices and also, at least in the provinces, receive them. In fact, Cassius Dio ridicules Caligula because he conse- crated himself to his own service as Jupiter Latiaris, aiUTO WaUTy lEpaTO.5? Later, in the third century, after the Tetrarchy had established the "Jovian" and "Herculian" dynasties, the situation became even more complex and in- volved, when "the Genius of each emperor, itself divine and an object of worship, was declared to be the very Genius of Jupiter and Hercules themselves."51 It is one thing, however, to believe in the simultaneity of the two natures, and to write about it, or even to act ac- cordingly; and it is another thing to represent the two na- tures in an image - sculpture, coin, or painting. "It was easy for the poet to find in Nero in uno et Martis vultus et Apollinis, but how was the sculptor or painter to render this subject?""2 The Roman engravers, who had to sink the dies for coins displaying the image of the imperial deus et dominus, sometimes may have struggled heavily to solve that difficult problem. It was easy enough to represent the emperor as god by furnishing him with the attributes of the deity, but it was hard to represent him as at once god and man. Various efforts by the Roman or provincial die- sinkers led in that direction, and at least one of the result- ing solutions, repeatedly applied during the third century, deserves our attention." Postumus, the Gallic emperor, seems to have started issuing a type of coin which, by means of jugate busts, combines the profile images of the emperor and of Hercules, a Hercules, to wit, whose features were so strongly assimilated to those of his human-imperial double that they suggested almost identity (Fig. 27).5" The same holds good for the jugate busts of Probus and Sol invictus, the emperor's comes (Fig. 28)."5 Coins of Carus show the emperor with the same god and in the same configuration, and in this case the inscription DEO ET DOMINO CARO AUG(usto) seems to mark the intention of a human-divine duplication even more clearly."5 Finally, if we pass over some other combinations,"7 a gold medallion of the early fourth century (Fig. 29 a) displays the profile of Invictus Constantinus, who on his shield exhibits the chariot of the Sun deity, and at the same time the jugate profile bust of a Sol invictus whose features strike us as representing--- especially in the aureus (Fig. 29 b) - almost a twin-like- ness of Constantine the Great himself.58 49.

Another kind of "duplication" seems to have started with Philip II of Macedonia, who, when celebrating the marriage of his daugh- ter (at Aigai, 336 B.c.), had his enthroned image allocated to those of the twelve gods to watch the play in the theatre; that is to say, the king in natura was to preside over the performance (had he not been murdered on that occasion) whereas the king in effigie was to attend as the "thirteenth god" in the midst of the twelve gods; cf.

The god might be honored as the comes or consors of the emperor, and the emperor, in his turn, might appear as the god's duplication in the flesh."5 However, the iconographical solution of representing the emperor as both "god" and "lord" at the same time is inter- esting because it is reminiscent, at least in one respect, of Christian solutions. The master of the Utrecht Psalter, for example, when representing the incarnate Christ at the side of the divine Christ (or "Christ-Logos"), distin- guishes the otherwise identical figures merely by a slight variance of the halo: a plain one for the Deus, and a cruci- form-halo for the Dominus. This distinction by means of the "headgear" is most conspicuous in the medallions of Probus or Constantine: the god, whose featues are identical with those of the emperors, wears the radiate crown whereas Probus is helmeted and Constantine laureate. This parallel does not suggest a "borrowing" from imperial coins on the part of the mediaeval artist; it merely implies a similar solution of a task which by its very nature was difficult to solve. When now we turn back again to the general period of the Winchester drawing, we find that difficulties of a perti- nent kind were felt by the Church itself. This is evinced, above all, by the Council of Constantinople in I 156.60 The question had arisen whether the sacrifice of the mass should not be offered solely to the Father and the Holy Spirit, since Christ as the High Priest could not offer himself to Him- self; or else, the idea of Christ the High Priest had to be discarded. In other words, the problem had turned up whether the straight and square confrontation of the two natures of Christ - as Offerer and as Recipient of the sacrifice - was still compatible with the Chalcedonian Creed or whether this duplication produced a "Nestorian" split of the unity of the Double Nature. A high member of the Eastern hierarchy, Soterichus, patriarch-elect of An- tioch, and a small group of bishops following him, there- fore had objected to a prayer to be said at the "Great En- trance" while the Cherubic Hymn was being sung, which contained the formula: "Thou art He that offerest, and art offered; and that acceptest and art distributed."'61 This prayer, which in the Byzantine liturgies can be traced back to the ninth century at the latest, appeared to the Patriarch as "Nestorian" because he felt that it placed the sacrificial Christ - secundum humanitatem - almost antithetically against Christ secundum divinitatem, who received the sacrifice, and that therefore it suggested "two Christs." The synod rejected the scruples of the patriarch-elect; it even declared him incapable of being invested with his high office. The matter, however, relevant to the problem here at issue is that among the authorities which the assembly adduced in order to prove the orthodoxy of the formula, we find Psalm I0o9.2 This reference is significant, since indeed the first verse of the psalm seemed to suggest a similar dupli- cation - Dominus Domino.63 The synod meant to dem- onstrate by this quotation that the abrupt confrontation of the two natures was in full agreement with the dogma, since they believed the psalm to emphasize, not the sever- ance, but the oneness of the two natures. It has seemingly never been investigated - and to do so is far beyond the scope of this study - to what extent the decision of I 156, confirming so energetically (as it does) the concept of Christ the High Priest, may have been re- sponsible for the development of an iconographical subject which began to make its appearance in the wall-paintings of Eastern churches in the twelfth century, or shortly there- after.64 We have to think, in the first place, of the type of the Xptoi~al'pXItpsi, the Christ in episcopal - and that is, sacrificial - attire, a representation which became very common in the decorations of Orthodox churches (Fig. 30), whereas it remained almost unknown in the West."6 In the second place, however, we have to recall the great cycles of the "Divine Liturgy" illustrating almost pro- grammatically that very verse which had caused the trou- ble in I 156: "Thou art He that offerest, and art offered [Fig. 31]; and that acceptest and art distributed [Fig. 32]." Did not, dogmatically, the Council of 1156 free the way to, and even encourage, those images in which the divine Christ in episcopal apparel is shown as he dismisses and blesses the cortege of angels carrying the sacrificed human Christ, and, at the same time, as he re- 59.

Morin, op. cit., III, i, p. 8o. The duplication results from the translation which renders the sign standing for Jehovah likewise with Dominus (KU6poC). 64.

D. V. Ainalov, "Nouveau type iconographique du Christ," Seminarium Kondakovianum, II,, 1928, p. 24, traces the concept of Christ the Priest to the apocryphal tradition of the sixth century which has influenced the illustration of Luke 4:14 f. This, how- ever, does not match exactly the type of Christ officiating in the Divine Liturgy, for which L. Brehier, "Une nouvelle theorie de l'histoire de l'art byzantin," Journal des savants, N.S. xii, 1914, p. 36, suggests Cappadocian origin. See, for Fig. 3o, G.

Eastern art felt unshocked at the portrayal of Christ confronting Himself in even more than one aspect. It felt unembarrassed at displaying the divine- human duplication in that naturalistic and forthright fash- ion which despite (or through?) its undeniable hieratic grandeur, its stern dignity, and its almost inexhaustible symbolism evokes somewhat bewildering, not to say un- canny, feelings in the unprepared occidental spectator. Even at the complete loss of this element of breath- taking emotion and sacred awe, the West has preferred to represent the two natures separately, either the one or the other. The God and the Man, when shown in the same panel, would be distributed to two different registers: in a lower compartment, the Madonna with the Infant, or the Crucified; in an upper, the exalted "King of Glory." It is like distributing the two natures to the two sides of a coin, a solution actually suggested by a seal of Charles the Bald: on the obverse side, an acclamation to the King of Glory; on the reverse, a supplication to the Son of Man.67 In all that there is tension, too, but not the awesome and per- plexing tension that results from the duplication of a fig- ure, from man's meeting squarely with his own otherness, his divine or deified self.6" Nor is anything like it to be found in the later Western images of the Trinity. True, the Trinities sometimes show three identical divine figures (Fig. 8), perplexing through the triplication of the same; but in these images the human nature of the Second Per- son suffers restriction - the manifest deficiency which the Winchester artist tried to overcome. Another type, very popular in later times, shows the "Throne of Grace," that is, the Father holding the crucified Christ before him, with the dove hovering in the center or the upper part of the image; but in this case, the unity and co-equality of the Three Persons remain in the sphere of the dogma with- out convincing the eye alone. These Trinities lack the in- ner tension, human or hieratic, which is absent also from the monstrous three-faced, three-headed, or three-busted Trinities which eventually were severely censured by the Church.69 We realize that to abandon the face-to-face confronta- tion of the two natures in one pictorial composition meant also to abandon a very strong and effective element of stir and commotion. And yet, it has been demonstrated by one, admittedly singular, specimen that it was not altogether be- yond artistic reach or possibility to depict, if on a very dif- ferent level, a meeting of god or man with his other self, a "meeting" which contained a maximum of tension and in- ner emotion, and which yet avoided, through its simple humanity, the perplexities of duplication or triplication. The unfinished, not too well-known Trinity, which has been sketched on the first folio of the MS Harley 603, is seemingly a hapax gegrammenon, a unique piece, and at the same time a masterpiece. There is no reason to reject the assumption that the sketch is contemporary with the main part of the codex -itself a copy of the Utrecht Psalter --and that therefore an Anglo-Saxon master working in the first decades of the eleventh century should be held responsible for that image (Fig. 35)-." In a rather large mandorla a simple throne-bench is decked with the customary roll-shaped cushion. On this God the Father is seated. A cruciform halo surrounding his head frames the soft waves of his parted hair. His feet rest on a footstool. His ankles, or rather the heels of his feet, are about to touch while the knees fall far apart and thus form a lap. In the lap, and balanced by the right knee, the Son is held, whose little feet are dangling in the air. The Son carries in the left hand a globe which appears very large, somewhat out of proportion with his stature. The Son is of an unusual age, neither babe nor adult. He may be seven, or ten, or twelve; one cannot tell. He is without halo, but he shares, as it were, the Father's crown of light and pain. A scroll - does it indicate the Verbum ? - winds across the Child's chest and over his right shoulder. It is held by the Father in the left hand and is gently supported by his right, which, at the same time, supports the cheek of 66.

Iv, c, who discusses also some of the "monstre" Trinities (monstrum in rerumn natura, according to Archbishop Antonine of Florence). Pope Urban VIII had those images publicly burned in 1628; cf. Usener, "Dreiheit," p. 182. For the "Throne of Grace," see MacHarg, op. cit., pp. 71 ff. (supra, n. i). A related concept within Eastern art has been reproduced by Helen Rubissow, Tihe Art of Russia, New York, 1946, pl. 2, to which Professor G. H. Williams, in Berkeley, has kindly called my attention. The fourteenth-century icon shows the Infant Jesus, with the dove in his chest, on the knees of the Father. The type can be traced back, in the East, to the twelfth century (see H. Gerstinger, Die griechische Buchmalerei, Vienna, 1926, pl. xviii, and p. 34 f.) and may be even older. It is most interesting to note that the repre- sentation of the anthropomorphic Holy Spirit was forbidden by Pope Benedict XIV (1740-58). 70. The manuscript is well known; see, e.g., Herbert, Illumi- nated Manuscripts, pp. i15 f. Reproductions of the Trinity, how- ever, are not known to me, nor does the Princeton Index seem to have this Trinity in its files. Mr. Francis Wormald, of the British Museum, has most kindly called my attention to this Trinity and has also provided me with a print of the image. To determine date, school, hand, or stemma of the sketch is beyond my present possi- bilities, and a more searching study than the one offered here must be left to the experts.</page><page sequence="17">THE QUINITY OF WINCHESTER 85 the Child. On the scroll, where it passes over the Father's left arm, and almost vertically above the globe, the dove has placed its feet. The Spirit that "bloweth as it listeth" seems surprised at realizing what Oneness it has produced. And the surprise is even greater with the four strange- looking angels which surround, and supposingly carry, the mandorla. They are the angels "desirous to look,"" the angels who, curious and furtive, yearn to watch the mys- tery that comes to pass behind the curtain of light formed by the mandorla. An enthroned figure with the Child on its lap, all by it- self, is anything but a rare and unfamiliar topic. Abraham, a bit stiff and hieratic, may be seen occasionally holding, not only Lazarus, but also the Infant Jesus on his knees (Fig. I I )." This, however, is subject matter belonging to a slightly later period. Here we may forget about it all the more readily as the one and only relevant model of the composition reveals itself at the first glance: the Madonna, the enthroned Virgin Mary with the Babe on her lap or her knees. Two remarkable changes of the model appear as the ingenious device of the artist. First, the Babe no longer is a babe, an "Infant Jesus." He is far too advanced in age to depend on the Mother or to sit on her lap. His nourishment is of a kind different from the milk of his Mother's breast. He has ceased to be, as it were, Mariae filius. Still, he is not yet the Teacher, the adult Christ, not yet Mariae dominus, though his boyhood does not permit us to forget entirely that the Child was born in the flesh by a mortal Mother. This impression, however, is counterbalanced, or even eclipsed, by the second change which the artist has con- trived. The place of the Mother has been taken by the Father. The birth in carne has been supplemented and supplanted, most visibly, by the generatio in spiritu, as be- fits the age of the boy. If ever a "Generation in the Spirit" has been convincingly demonstrated, and in a manner both delightful and stirring, it is in this Anglo-Saxon sketch. The delicacy of the feelings which it discloses seems to make the most delicate Madonna appear somewhat coarse and with some residuum of the christotokos. The scene showing the Son in the arms of his Father has the touch of an un- surpassed purity and chastity, the touch of a loving tender- ness which differs from that of a mother and yet includes it. Moreover, it has the touch of simplicity without rusticity, of that simple beauty and unbroken passion which are so familiar to us from the figures on Greek vases and from the verses of early Greek lyrics. The Son is doubtless the Father's equal. It is not only the physical features - the double-curve of the lips, the strangely drawn brows vaulting over the half-closed lids of slightly slanted eyes, the long straight nose - which be- tray the co-equality. It is, above all, the Child's spirit which has been awakened to equal that of the Father. Anselm's pressing question, posed more than two generations later, Cur Deus homo? Cur homo Deus?, has found a clear and forthright answer in this embracement without words, and with thought silenced. The mute oneness of Father and Son beyond word or thought solves, as it were, the mys- teries of incarnation and deification. The Son that lifts and lends his face to the Father and still clings to the globe of the universe, the Father that bends his head down to the Son, they both seem to be melting away in that timeless moment of surrender, one spirit, one flesh, each meeting his own self in the other, each God and man at the same time. What difference does it make who holds the globe! It is as though the Father, while with half-closed eyes he presses the cheek of the lad to his cheek, were speaking, not through the medium of word or thought, but through the co-equal rhythm of the pulses: "What difference which of us should hold the globe! What difference who has cre- ated this universe! We ourselves do not know. What I have created, is your creation; for what I have done, has been done for you, and therefore by you. If your nature be human, I am man too. And if I be the creating God, you are the creating God too." Here there is no split. It is the true Oneness of the Two Natures. And it is all human or, which is the same, all divine. And it is both at once. Goethe, in his notes on the paintings of Philostratus, discusses the relationship between Heracles and his son Telephos as depicted by the Greek master. He calls the conception "infinitely tender" (unendlich zart), and he meditates: "Unfortunately, the more modern art7" has been hindered by religious accidents from forming the most delightful proportions, the relations of father to son, of fosterer to infant, of educator to pupil, whereas surely ancient art has handed to us the most delicious documents of that kind.""'74 Goethe, as always, has struck the vital chord; his verdict has proved, on the whole, to be justified. To the rule, however, the Harley Trinity forms the excep- tion. Like so many works of Anglo-Saxon art, this sketch discloses an un-Roman lyrical undercurrent. It is as though from far away "a glance has flashed" to meet the artist. There does not seem to occur, in the Middle Ages, an epistrophe of his concept. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 71. Cf. I Peter 1:12 concerning the mysteries of salvation "which things angels desire to look into." In the sense of angelic curiosity, which tries to glimpse behind the curtains of the Holy of Holies, this verse was quoted by Moses Bdr Kaph, (813-903) in his Exposition of the Liturgy; see R. H. Connolly and H. W. Codrington, Two Commentaries on the Jacobite Liturgy, London, 1913, p. 67. The verse fairly describes the curious eyes of the angels surrounding the mandorla. 72.
