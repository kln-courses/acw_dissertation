Introduction This paper examines how Hadith-minded and Sufi biographers repre- sented their respective heroes. Authors in both traditions made assump- tions about why IHadith-scholars or Sufis should exist at all, and then compiled testimony about representative members of each group. In the course of centuries of expansion, revision, and re-contextualization, the life-stories of the early exemplars underwent complex and often surprising transformations. In the case of Hadith-scholars and Sufis, these transformations resulted from changing conceptions of heirship to the Prophet and of the proper relationship between the different groups of heirs. Biographies possess particular importance for cultural history inas- much as they exemplify characterization - the process by which culture represents persons. Admittedly the term "characterization" is more usually applied only to fictional characters. From a historian's viewpoint, certainly, a difference must exist between fictional characters and repre- sented real persons (2). Moreover, believing Muslims may join historians in insisting that the heroes of classical biography possess particular moral significance precisely because of their having actually lived and acted in (1) I thank Professors Wolfhart Heinrichs and Roy Mottahedeh for their comments on the research upon which this study is based, and Professors A. Kevin Reinhart, Michael Cook, Tayeb El-Hibri, and Christopher Melchert for their many insightful comments on drafts of this paper. Any errors of fact or interpretation are of course my own.

But as long ago as 1734, the Puritan divine Jonathan Edwards ruefully conceded that no matter how true or important a story may be, it differs in no intrinsic or self-evident way from a pure fantastication. "A person by mere nature... may be liable to be affected with the story of Jesus Christ, and the sufferings he underwent, as well as by any other tragical story: he may be the more affected with it from the interest he conceives mankind to have in it : yea, he may be affected with it without believing it; as well as a man may be affected with what he reads in a romance, or sees acted in a stage play (3)". So indistinguishable are the two forms, says Edwards, that the reader can recognize a story as true only by divine grace. Once textualized, in other words, all persons are created equal. Working from a secularized versions of the same argument, modern historians have made the application of narratological analysis to histo- riography a familiar procedure. This procedure appeals particularly to the student of classical Arabic biography for two reasons. First, despite a number of vividly depicted imaginary personages, classical Arabic lite- rature appears to have been far more concerned with real people. Des- pite its variety and profusion, however, classical Arabic biography all too often fails to meet the expectations of modern readers in search of "psychological insight" or "well-rounded characters". Obviously the bio- graphers were aiming at something else, and a detailed account of the premises and techniques of representing persons, real or not, offers the best hope of discerning what their aims might have been. Second, any diachronic survey of biographical entries on prominent persons reveals a curious fact: generation after generation of biogra- phers, all ostensibly committed to a high ideal of documentary accuracy, produced quite divergent versions of the same life. Clearly the biogra- phers' own preoccupations, whether spiritual, polemical, or aesthetic, had a decisive influence upon their representations of the human sub- ject (4). While this is necessarily true for any literary tradition, classical Arabic biography offers an unusually massive amount of documentation for it: one thousand years of dictionary entries and monographs, often treating the very same (albeit extremely large) set of persons. Given this (3) Jonathan Edwards, "A Divine and Supernatural Light", in Selected Writings offonathan Edwards, ed. Harold P. Simonson (New York : Ungar, 1970), 71.

This study will examine the premises and techniques that shaped two particular biographical traditions. It aims at neither a belletristic appre- ciation of the biographers' prose style nor at an evaluation of the histo- rical accuracy of the claims the writers make. Rather, this paper explores the ways in which the representation of two particular exemplars varied with the preoccupations of their biographers, changed across centuries, and succeeded in encoding at every stage a particular conception of how "representative men" (in Thoreau's phrase) should comport themselves on earth and in heaven. Of the mass of anecdotes that constitute biography, many emphasize the hero's virtues by explicit or implicit comparison to representatives of competing traditions. I have chosen to examine the life stories of two contemporaries each of whom represented a distinct human ideal: the Hadith-scholar and legist Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (164-241/780-855) and the renunciant Bishr b. al-Harith al-Hafi (c. 152-227/c. 766-841). Because of their temporal, physical, and spiritual proximity, these two men were often compared, meaning that the reader can examine biographers' de- pictions not only of their respective heroes (whether scholar or mystic) but of the "rival" hero as well. In Ibn Hanbal's case, my account will pay particular attention to the techniques his biographers used to vindicate his performance in the Inquisition, a formative event in the development of the self-definition of the 'ulamia'. In Bishr's case, my account will trace his miraculous transformation from Hadith-scholar to saint, a trans- formation brought about by the Sufi biographer's insistence upon retro- jecting the presence of their community a century or more into the past. The concluding section will examine how biographers in both traditions represented the relationship between the two exemplars. Stories invol- ving both men, surprisingly frequent in the biographies of each, place the greatest stress (in both senses of the word) upon the self-definition of their communities and upon the conventions of representation that governed the activities of their biographers. II. Collective Identity and Biographical Practice In his discussion of the legality or real-estate transactions in Baghdad, al-Khatib al-Baghddadi reports that scholars who consider the region usur- ped (dir ghasb) have forbidden the buying and selling of lots there. Al-Khatib reports that a woman living in Baghdad sent her son to ask permission to sell a house she had inherited. "Son", she said, "go to Ahmad Ibn Hanbal and Bishr b. al-IHLrith and ask them about it, because 73</page><page sequence="4">MICHAEL COOPERSON I do not like making decisions they might disapprove of'. According to the son's report, both men agreed that the house could be sold but not the lot. "I returned to my mother and informed her of this, and she did not sell the lot (5)". One might well consult the celebrated Hadith-scholar Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, "the champion of the Sunna and the senior figure of his community (6)" about such a matter, but the mother's insistence on asking Bishr's opinion as well provokes some curiosity. Bishr b. al-Hfirith, known as "al-Ha:fi", "the barefoot", had studied Hadith and possibly jurisprudence as well, but subsequently renounced formal study and withdrew into a life of pious seclusion (7). According to various accounts, the Baghdadis knew him as a ragged, half-starved man who accepted no students or petitioners. Yet al-Khatib's report suggests that he shared Ibn Hanbal's status as arbiter of ethics in the city of Baghdad. Al-Khatib's account is one of many depicting the two famous pietists as concurring in a judgement or, more often, deferring to each other in matters of conduct. In one case, Ibn Hanbal declined to answer a ques- tion regarding scrupulosity on the grounds that he ate Baghdad produce, that is, food tainted by the usurpation of the land where it was grown : "If I were Bishr b. al-Harith", said Ibn Hanbal, "I would be fit to answer you. He would eat neither the produce of Baghdad nor any food from the Sawad (8)", i.e., "he is more scrupulous than I". Just as frequently, Bishr defers to Ibn Hanbal. In one account, Bishr was asked "What softens the heart ?" and replied with a Qur'anic verse: "Do hearts not find peace in the remembrance of God ?" (13:28) The questioner then admitted that he had already posed the same question to Ibn Hanbal, who replied that eating ritually permitted foods softens the heart. Bishr then declared Ibn Hanbal's response a better one (9). Opinions are less cordial, however, when a third party compares the two men. Bildl al-Khawwis reports meeting the prophet al-Khidr in a dream and asking him about the relative status of Bishr al-Hilfi and Ibn Hanbal. Al-Khidr replied that when Bishr died "he left no one like himself behind", implying that Bishr must have been superior to Ibn Hanbal, who was still alive at the time of the mystic's death. Of Ibn Hanbal himself, al-Khidr says only that he was "a truthful man (10)". Naturally, Ibn HIanbal's biographers reverse the order of precedence.

Even Bishr, for all his spiritual attainment, could not bear solitude for long ; he would go out visiting an hour here and and hour there (11). This insistence upon comparing Ibn .Hanbal and Bishr appears to have arisen from a perceived awkwardness in the two men's presence toge- ther in Baghdad. As their life stories will show, Ibn .Hanbal engaged the world, while Bishr renounced it; and these respective preferences may have set limits upon the degree to which either man could wholehear- tedly admire the other. This Weberian characterization of the relations- hip in fact reformulates an element of the classical Arabic biographers' notion that the two men belonged to different traditions of heirship to the Prophet Muhammad. Taking their cue from the Prophet's dictum that "Those who know ('ulamli) are the heirs of the prophets", biogra- phers stated or assumed that the survival of the Muslim community depended upon the ongoing performance of those tasks the Prophet performed in exemplary fashion during his lifetime. In the late fourth/ tenth century - that is, over a century after the death of Ibn Hanbal and Bishr - biographers began to classify "those who know" into groups (ta'ifa, pl. tawd'if, among other terms), and to assign to certain of these groups a share in the Prophet's legacy. In the biographical works that arose in conjunction with these schemes of classification, Ibn Hanbal and Bishr sometimes appear together - both are .Hadith-scholars, for example, or saints - and in other cases not. The extent to which the two men came to represent divergent styles of piety depended on the extent to which a given biographer held the claims of the respective td'ifas to be not only different but mutually competitive or even exclusive. Biographers and theorists offered various accounts of how the com- munity as a whole was to divide the Prophet's labors. Al-Sarrdj divided "those who know" into the three categories of Hadith-scholars, jurispru- dents, and Sufis (12), while Abti Talib al-Makki listed the "men represen- ting the aspects of religion" into the five categories of caliph, jurispru- dent, Hadith-scholar, Qur'an-reader, and renunciant (zadbid) (13). It is no accident that these two master plans, both of which grant equal status to the Sufi td'ifa, were proposed by Sufi theorists. One has the impres- sion that the proliferation of etiological narratives for the various scho- larly and/or sanctified ta'ifas owes something to the Sufi biographers' attempts to carve out a place for themselves in a hierarchy unselfcons- (11) Aba Nu'aym, Hilya, 9:183.

Despite their de- mands for equal standing, however, the Sufi biographers did not hesitate to use their subjects as sticks to bash their fellow heirs the .Hadith- scholars, as our examination of Bishr's biographies will show. As employed in these schemes of classification, the term "t 'zifa" refers both to notional communities and to social entities, classical writers assuming - either by conviction or for convenience - that the two were one and the same. Having ordered their subjects on the basis of scholarly and other communitarian affiliations, biographers justified such affilia- tions with "charter myths" (15) tracing the community's origin to Divine and prophetic mandate. These myths of origin formed an armature for the writing of life-stories, and the resulting biographical texts leave the impression that tX 'zfa - affiliation was both conscious and exclusive. For the third/ninth century, however, any such characterization smacks of back-projection on the part of the biographer. (16) For example, Bishr al-Hdfi does not appear to have called himself an heir of the Prophet, but his Sufi biographers did label the saints - of whom, they claim, Bishr was one - heirs and "knowers", thus imputing to the mystic a tt'zfa - consciousness he gives little evidence of having possessed (17). According, then, to their later biographers, scholars such as Ibn Han- bal claimed heirship because they preserved and disseminated the Pro- phetic Sunna as recorded in the Hadith, while Sufis such as Bishr claimed to have inherited the Prophet's esoteric knowledge or at least his role (14) On the self-characterization of the legists (admittedly based on later sources), see A. Kevin Reinhart, "Transcendence and Social Practice: Muftis and Q.dis as Religious Inter- preters", Annales islamologiques 27 (1993), 5-28, esp. 9-10, where the legists are described as dividing the community into the two simple blocs of the learned and unlearned, the former of course being the heirs of the prophets. (15) On this term see Bronislaw Malinowski, Myth in Primitive Psychology (New York, 1926), esp. 19, 36-59. (16) Discussing manifestations of self-awareness among practitioners of the various fourth/ tenth-century intellectual disciplines, Wolfhart Heinrichs notes : "By back-projection, combi- ned with a keen interest in awa'il 'firsts; they create the impression that the same kind of compartmentalization with which they were faced already obtained a hundred and more years earlier, when in fact there are a number of indications that in this formative period the exchange of ideas between disciplines was of a much more common occurrence".

Although not necessarily irreconcilable, these two mandates and the premises that supported them produced - in some biographers'minds at least - a sense that the representatives of the different t.~'ifas must inevitably regard one another with suspicion and compete with one another for the allegiance of their contempora- ries. At the same time, however, the necessary coexistence of the ti'ifas in the social world appears to have militated against any conclusive literary resolution of the questions that divided them. In fact, the mature biographical tradition, exemplified by such figures as Abfu Nu'aym al- Isfahdni (d. 430/1038) and Ibn al-Jawzi (d. 597/1200), became quite adept at finding or adapting anecdotes (18) that encoded complex relationships of mutual deference among representatives of the two tc'ifas in ques- tion. III. Ibn Hanbal Ibn .Hanbal, his biographers write, devoted himself from an early age to the study of Hadith and acquired a lifelong reputation for poverty and humility. "I possessed nothing but a sack for my books", he said descri- bing his period of study in Kufa. "I would lay the sack on top of a brick, and sleep with my head on the sack". He also outstripped his fellows in memorizing .Hadith : "[My teacher] would often recite ten HI.adiths [in a row], and I would memorize them. When he got up and left, [the others] would ask me to dictate them all back, and I would" (19). Ibn Hanbal not only memorized a million .Hadiths along with their isnids, but strove to make his life conform in every detail to their prescriptions. "I have never written down a Hadith of the Prophet without putting it into practice," he is supposed to have said. "Once I came across a Hadith to the effect that the Prophet had himself cupped and paid Abu Tayba one dinar; so when I had myself cupped, I paid the cupper a dinar", probably too much to pay for a cupping (20). When Ibn Hanbal bought a concubine, (18) Akbbir : I shall not be dealing directly with the issue of relationships between eyewitnesses, transmitters, and compilers, as raised by Stefan Leder in a number of studies; the reader will nevertheless note that the types of variations in the reports cited here parallel Leder's characterization of the narrative tradition.

He even attempted to bring his every casual ut- terance into conformity with the Sunna, refusing for example to say "Praise God" when asked about his poor health - until Bishr al-HIIfi sent him a message explaining that the Companions did not consider the expression to be a complaint (22). In spite of his conspicuously successful emulation of the Prophet, Ibn Hanbal - according to the biographical sources - lived in a state of almost constant self-recrimination and despair. In one such account, a neighbor describes the squalor of his dress and the morbidity of his temperament : I went into the entryway and found [Ibn Hanbal] sitting on the dirt floor. The dye in his hair had run, and I could see the white roots of his hair. He was wearing a small and soiled karamis waist-wrapper and a coarse shirt with dirt on the shoulder and sweat-stains on the collar. I asked him a question about scrupulosity and the acquisition of merit. No sooner had I asked the question than I saw his face fall and assume a sorrowful expression, as if he were disgusted with, and sorry for, himself, so much so that it pained me to watch him. As we were leaving, I said to someone who was with me, "Some days he seems so dissatisfied with himself' (23). Two distinct considerations explain the presence of accounts such as this. First, Ibn Hanbal's ambitious project is doomed to failure because he cannot fully emulate a man who himself emulated no one. The Pro- phet lived spontaneously, and spontaneity by definition lies beyond the reach of imitation. The imam's (24) much-documented self-abasement, self-deprecation, and depression appear natural enough responses to failure of his project. Second, as Ibn Hanbal's contemporaries appear to have furtively conceded, the complete success of the his project would broach the scandalous possibility that he could come to replace the Prophet. This possibility, though blasphemous, was not literally unthin- kable: a scholar of the next generation, Abo Bakr al-Khallal, mentions an "ignoramus" who, envious of the praise heaped upon Ibn Hanbal, said of his followers : "Ibn Hanbal is their prophet" (25). As if in ackno- wledgement of this dreadful possibility, Ibn Hanbal himself reportedly condemned those who recorded his opinions in writing, fearing (as H. Laoust expresses it) that his ra'y (personal opinion) "might then (21) Ibn al-Jawzi, Manaqib, 178-179. (22) Ibn al-Jawzi, Manaiqib, 177. (23) Md ardhu yantafi' bi-nafsibi ayydman.

Apart from the historical reality or psychological plausibility of Ibn Hanbal's morbid self-criticism, its appearance in biography serves the strategic purpose of emphasizing that, appearances to the contrary, he never actually succeeded in attaining his object. His biographers could theoretically have made the same point by citing a few instances of Ibn Hanbal's failure to live up to the Prophet's Sunna. But classical Arabic biography functions by accumulating anec- dotes each of which presumably stood alone once and could conceivably do so again. His biographers could not document a conspicuous failure on Ibn Hanbal's part without providing the imam's detractors with a denigrating anecdote for their anti-Hanbali arsenal, or indeed without providint their own enemies with cause to impugn the sincerity of their affiliations (2). Accounts of the imm's self-deprecation resolve the di- lemma by suggesting that he must indeed have failed in some matter of faith or practice, but cleverly leave the lapse of commission or omission to the reader's imagination (while simultaneously conferring upon Ibn Hanbal the additional virtue of humility). Asked to pray on behalf of a crippled neighbor, Ibn Hanbal is said to have exclaimed, "Rather she should pray for us !" (28) Having thus forestalled the disturbing possibility of Ibn Hanbal's at- tainment of perfect emulation, his biographers proceed to catalogue his exemplary virtues in exhaustive detail. Ibn al-Jawzi, for example, provides exactly the sort of information about Ibn Hanbal that Ibn Hanbal himself sought out about the Prophet, including not only his opinions on matters of faith and practice but his habits of speech, eating, and dress. We are told, for example, that Ibn Hanbal believed that faith can increase or decrease, that the doctrine of the created Qur'an constitutes unbelief, and that the anthropomorphic verses are not to be interpreted allego- rically (29). We are also told that he wore yellow shoes, depilated himself at home instead of at the bathhouse, and patched his clothes in colors that did not match (30). (26) H-.Laoust, "Ahmad b. Hanbal", EI2, 274. Ibn Hanbal's condemnation of any attempts to record his opinions places the responsible biographer in a difficult position. Ibn al-Jawzi lamely argues that although Ibn Hanbal forbade anyone to commit his pronouncements to writing, "God decreed that they be recorded and organized and spread far and wide" (Mantaqib, 194). (27) On the consequences that allegedly befell al-Khatib al-Baghdddi for failing to call Ibn Hanbal afaqih, see Ibn al-Jawzi, Muntazam, ed. M. A. 'Atd et al.

But at least one source frankly attributes the imam's exemplary status to the admiration accorded him in the wake of his performance during the 'Abbasid Inquisition (mihna) over the created- ness of the Qur'dn. "I always hear people speaking highly of Ibn Hanbal and granting him precedence over [the Hadith-scholars] Yah.ya b. Ma'in and Abfo Khaythama", said his colleague Abf Zur'a. "It was never that way before the Inquisition ; after he was tried, however, his reputation knew no bounds" (31). During the persecutions initiated by the Caliph al-Ma'mfn in 218/833, Ibn Hanbal refused to uphold the doctrine of the created Qur'an, insis- ting that his opponents provide evidence for it from the Book itself or the Prophetic Hadith. After a thirteen-month imprisonment and three days of interrogation before al-Ma'mfn's successor al-Mu'tasim, Ibn Han- bal was flogged in open court. Although the Tabaqat of Ibn Hanbal's contemporary Ibn Sa'd states that the imam never capitulated (32), the bulk of early evidence weighs against him. The Mu'tazili al-jahiz, for example, characterizes Ibn Hanbal as a stubborn and prevaricating igno- ramus who recanted after a few blows of the whip; and a younger contemporary, the philo-'Alid historian al-Ya'qfbi, describes the imam as giving in to a facile version of the statist argument that the caliph is entitled to propound new dogma (33). In any event, Ibn Hanbal was released, but apparently stopped tea- ching IHadith (34). Eventually the Caliph al-Mutawakkil lifted the Inquisi- tion, reversed the regime's position on both the Qur'an and the ima-m, and plied Ibn Hanbal with gifts and requests that he come teach the Caliph's sons at Samarra (35). On the assumption that the imam had never capitulated, biographers glorified him as the savior of the faith: (31) Ibn al-Jawzi, Mancqib, 337-338. (32) Muhammad b. Sa'd al-Zuhri (d. 230/845), AI-Tabaqzit al-kubri (Beirut, 1377/1958), 7:354, with additions by later hands in Ibn Hanbal's entry. (33) 'Amr b.

Abi Ya'qib (d. 284/898), Ta'rikh al-Ya'qzTb (Beirut, 1379/1960), 2:472. (34) This happened either immediately after the Inquisition, or in 227/842, i.e. during the reign of al-Withiq. If the former, it may have been a condition of his release (something the Hanbali sources would not tell us). The sources for the latter date state that Ibn Hanbal stopped at his own initiative after being reported to the still-ongoing Inquisition (Christopher Melchert, personal communication). (35) On the Inquisition see W. M. Patton, Ahmed Ibn Hanbal and the Mibna (Leiden, 1897) ; D.

He spoke forthrightly, and revealed the truth ; he shone in his words, and provided a meet example. He triumphed over scholars, and crushed the mighty. How he stands out among the truthful, and how close he is to the ancients (36) ! To make such claims plausible, the Hanbali biographical tradition had to stuggle mightily to vindicate its hero's performance under the lash and to explain why he was released if he had never capitulated. At stake was the relationship of the td'ifa of Hadith-scholars to that of the caliphs, themselves heirs of the Prophet (3) and, to al-Ma'mfun's mind at least, possessors of 'ilm (knowledge) (38). If the Hadith-scholars' claim to the Prophetic inheritance was to survive against that of the caliphs, the Hanbali biographers had to come up with a version of events that ex- plained the imam's release. Such versions were not long in coming. Within two generations of Ibn Hanbal's death, we find an account of the flogging attributed to one Abut 'Imran according to which the imam was beaten until the whips "split open his midriff, and the entrails spilled out". The Caliph (called "the enemy of God" in this account) along with his judge Ibn Abi Du'ad ("the heretic") then leave the palace, only to be accosted by a mob enraged by reports that Ibn Hanbal is dead. Fearing revolt in the pro- vinces, the Caliph releases the imam, who has not capitulated (39). The more restrained accounts attributed to Ibn Hanbal's son Salih and his nephew Hanbal b. Ishaq have the imam himself claim that he lost consciousness during the flogging.

The family accounts furthermore depict the Caliph as hesitant to harm the imam, a significant difference in attitude from Abu 'Imrdn's vilification of the ruler and his entou- rage (40). The biographer Abi Nu'aym al-Isfahani, an early source for the SaTlih-account, also mentions a report by one Ibn al-Faraj, who claims to have witnessed the flogging from the first row of spectators (41). Accor- ding to Ibn al-Faraj, the police chief succeeded in convincing both the Caliph and the imam that the other had recanted. As if to overdetermine his explanation for the Caliph's decision to release the imam, AbQ al-Faraj mentions the displeasure of the Khurasani generals (associates of the imam's father), the mob at the gates, and - most importantly - the miracle of the trousers. I was watching Ahmad Ibn Hanbal as the blows fell on his shoulders. He was wearing trousers held up with a cord. The cord broke and the trousers slipped down. I noticed him move his lips, and the trousers were restored. [Later] I asked him about this and he said, "When the trousers slipped I said, "God, my God and Lord, you have stood me in this place; so do not expose me in public view". Then the trousers were restored (42)". Here the tc'ifa has resorted to a tale of divine intervention to support its claim that in the struggle between the two heirs of the Prophet, Caliph and Hadith-scholar, God stands on the side of Ibn Hanbal and, by ex- tension, on the side of his tW'ifa and its claims to authority. As the Hanbali biographical tradition grew more sophisticated, some of the conspicuously unlikely or inglorious elements in these accounts were quietly dropped. Abfi 'Imran's account, with its intestinal ruptures and perambulant caliphs, is never heard of again. Salih's account, with its theological glosses and general verisimilitude, served as the basis for the later accounts of the Inquisition, although such biographers as Ibn al-Jawzi, al-Maqdisi, al-Maqrizi also drew upon such elements of Ibn al-Faraj's account as helped them make sense of the awkward fact of the imam's release. One report, attributed to two eyewitnesses and repro- duced in al-Maqdisi's biography of the imam, takes the masterful step of linking the miracle to the appearance of the mob at the gates : 82 (40) Abfi al-Fadl Silih b.

He had hardly finished his prayer when we saw a golden hand emerge from under his sash and restore it to its place by the power of Almighty God. At that the common people raised an outcry (fa-dajfat al-'amma) and prepared to storm the palace, and [the Caliph] ordered him released (43). The later biography by al-Maqrizi juxtaposes this account with a strea- mlined version of an old report attributed to the police chief himself, whose testimony makes it explicit that the miracle, and the spectators' reaction to it, frightened the Caliph into releasing Ibn Hanbal : By God, I witnessed the day Ahmad Ibn Hanbal was flogged and his trousers rose after dropping, and retied themselves after coming loose. I have never seen a day more momentous/difficult for (a'zam 'aldi) al-Mu'tasim than that one. By God, if he hadn't stopped the flogging, he (44) would not have been able to leave the place alive (45). Two narrative techniques - the insertion of a conjunction (fa -) in the first account, and the shift in perspective in the second - establish connections between heretofore isolated units of pro-Ibn-Hanbal testi- mony, ultimately producing a narration of causally linked and mutually confirming events and impressions. Further additions to the Inquisition-tale spell out the most important implications of the imam's defiance. To demonstrate that Ibn Hanbal himself realized what was at stake and that he acted with the conscious intention of setting an example, Ibn al-Jawzi (among others) includes a report of how the imam's colleague al-Marrudhi tried to dissuade him from subjecting himself to the Inquisition. "Go outside", Ibn Hanbal tells him, "and take a good look". Outside the palace al-MarriOdhi finds a innumerable crowd of people carrying writing-sheets, pens, and inkwells, all waiting to write down the imam's opinion on the createdness of the Qur'dn. "Can I mislead all those people, Marrtidhi ?" asks Ibn Hanbal. "I will kill myself before I do that (46) !" A second important element of the eventual Hanbali concensus is its exculpation of the caliphate. Soon after his flogging, Ibn IIanbal is said to have characterized his resistance to the Inquisition as follows : "By God, I have done my best. I never meant to win or lose; all I want to (43) Taqi al-Din al-Maqdisi (d. 600/1203-04), Mibnat al-Imam Abhmad Ibn Hanbal, ed. A.A. Al-Turki (Giza, 1987), 109.

After the quiet disappearance of Abu 'Imran's frankly anti-'Abbasid account, a similar accommodationism be- comes the norm in Hadith-minded accounts of the Inquisition. Al-Subki, for example, argues that the Inquisition constituted an aberration from the otherwise praiseworthy conduct of the 'Abbdsid caliphs, who were led astray by "evil scholars" ('ulamli' al-si') (48). This argument exone- rates Ibn Hanbal (who, as late as the ninth/fifteenth century, was in some circles still assumed to have capitulated (49)) as well as the caliph, whose monopoly on coercion in service of the faith is acknowledged and affir- med (50). Despite their success in saving Ibn Hanbal's reputation and suppor- ting his claims against the Caliph, narratives of patent implausibility met with the stern disapproval of rigorist biographers. Al-Dhahabi, for exam- ple, criticizes his predecessor al-Bayhaqi for citing the trouser-tale "wi- thout daring to point out its undependability (51)". Saving Ibn Hanbal by the seat of his pants solved the problem of the Inquisition, but the use of the miracle-tale constituted a transgression of the conventions of Hadith-minded biography, which - at least as embodied in the rigorism of al-Dhahabi - deplored the attribution of miracles to scholars. Ibn al-Jawzi's Mandqib mentions numerous miracles (kardmat) attributed to the imam, but al-Dhahabi calls such tales munkara, "reprehensible" as well as "unlikely". At most, al-Dhahabi is willing to concede that such exaggerations may arise from praiseworthy motives and that they serve to "cheer the heart of the believer (52)". Curiously, Ibn al-Jawzi himself (47) Abfi Nu'aym, Hilya, 9:206. The imam is apparently quoting 'Umar b. al-Khattab, who on his deathbed said of his caliphate : "Wadidtu anna dhalika kafdfun l 'alayya wa-la li" Saihb al-Bukhdrt, ed. M. T.

(50) This compromise contrasts sharply with the intransigence of the Twelver Shi'i bio- graphers, who in their accounts of confrontations between the caliphs and the Imams con- sistently represent the 'Abbasid caliphs (including the purportedly philo-'Alid al-Ma'mun) as treacherous and bloodthirsty tyrants. See, e.g., Ibn Babawayh al-Qummi (d. 381/991), 'Uyun akhbdr al-Rida (Najaf, 1390/1970), 2:241; 244-53. (51) Mdjasara 'ald tawhiyatibh. AI-Dhahabi, Siyar, 11:256.

Whatever its propriety, the attribution of miraculous manifestations to Ibn Hanbal breaks down one of the barriers between the conventions for representing Hadith-minded exemplars and those for representing saints, and it is no accident that the earliest extant biographical entry on the imam that attributes miracles is the Hilyat al-awliyd' of Abu Nu'aym al-Isfahdini, who recognized no distinction between the two categories of men. According to Abu Nu'aym, both a Hadith-scholar like Ibn Hanbal and a renunciant like Bishr al-Halfi are equally saints (awliyd), and the Hilya contains biographies of both of them (54). The HIilya also initiates the tradition of comparing the two men, a tradition that was to continue uninterrupted until modern times. To understand the bases and results of this comparison, one must first determine how it was that Bishr, who abandoned the study of Hadith and made every attempt to drop out of sight altogether, came to have the privilege of sharing narrative space with Ibn Hanbal. IV. Bishr al-Hafi Bishr b. al-HaIrith, like Ibn Hanbal, began his career as a simple scholar of Hadith. According to Ibn Sa'd, Bishr came to Baghdad from Marw and heard a great deal of Hadith from prominent transmitters. He taught a little as well, and some accounts even place Ibn Hanbal among those who heard him transmit (55). "Then", says Ibn Sa'd, Bishr "devoted him- self to the worship of God and withdrew from people, transmitting no Hadith (56)". This did nothing to stop numerous early authorities from mentioning him primarily if not exclusively as a Hadith-scholar. At the same time, passing references indicate that he had attained a reputation for exemplary piety: "His proclivities to asceticism, his covert renuncia- tion (zubd) and scrupulosity (wara'), and the narratives thereof, are too (53) Ibn al-Jawzi, Sifat al-safwa (Hyderabad, 1936-1938), 1:4 ; Naqd al-'ilm wa 1-'ulamd' aw Talbis Iblis, ed.

(54) See Abui Nu'aym, Hilya, 9:161-233 (Ibn Hanbal), 8:336-360 (Bishr), as well as Ibn al-Jawzi's criticism of Abi Nu'aym for making Ibn Hanbal a Sufi (Sifat al-safwa, 1:3-4). Ibn Hanbal, says Ibn al-Jawzi, "had no idea of any such thing", i.e., of Sufism. For uses of Ibn Hanbal in Sufi aphoristic literature, see Leah Kinberg, "What is meant by zuhd', Studia Islamica 61 (1985), 27-44, at 38 and 41 (where the imam proposes yet another tripartite division of the believers).

Some two hundred years after his death, the "narratives of his asce- ticism" began to appear in the literary tradition, and have continued to accumulate ever since. The Bishr of the later sources does far more than retire into pious seclusion. By the fourth/tenth century, his scrupulosity reaches the point that his finger twitches spontaneously in the presence of forbidden food (58) ; by the fifth/eleventh, he can walk 160 miles in a single afternoon on an errand of mercy (59) ; by the eleventh/seventeenth at the latest, he can walk on water (60). Mere attendance at his funeral, we are told, sufficed to guarantee salvation (61). How did this transformation begin ? Some 150 years after Bishr's death, theorists such as al-Kaldbddi and al-Sarrdj began staking out a role for a ta'ifa called the Sufis. Al-Sarraj explicitly numbers them among the "knowers" and "heirs of the prophets"; al-Kaldbadi even says that they "have understood on the authority of God" (fahimzt 'an Alldh), that is, not on the authority of ('an) some mortal source, as in the case of the Hadith-scholars (62). Both authors place Bishr among the Sufis, and al- Sarraj ascribes to him a number of pious pronouncements and exhor- tations (63). Soon after, in the fourth/tenth century, Sufi biographers began writing histories of the td'ifa, histories consisting of the biogra- phies of its members (64). The introductions to such works as are extant follow the theorists in using a variety of Qur'anic verses and Prophetic Hadith to expound the doctrine of a sanctified elite. The biographical entries proper use the sayings of the early Sufis - among them Bishr - to support the td'ifa's collective claim to authority. Al-Sulami's Tabaqdt, the earliest extant biographical work on Sufis, claims that the Sufis (or (57) Ibn Hajar Al-'Asqalani, Tahdhib, 1:445. Bishr appears in Ibn Hibbin al-Busti's (d. 354/965) Thiqdt (Hyderabad, 1973), 8:143, but not in his Mashdhir 'ulami' al-ams r (ed. M.

The saints, implicitly, have "LHadith" of their own, which al-Sulami calls bikayaCt ("direct quotations") ; each biographical entry includes not only a Prophetic IHadith related by the saint but a number (usually twenty) of his own bikayat (66). Having included Bishr in the first tabaqa ("generation") of Sufis, al-Sulami supplies him with the required twenty bikiyit (67). This creation of articulate "generations" some two centuries before the biographer's own time signals the tc 'ifa's determination to project its existence into the past. By linking the ta'i fa' charter myth to the lives of historical individuals, al-Sulami's work pro- vides a narrative armature for the new ta'ifa, and, eventually, a frame- work for Bishr's retrospective sainthood. Al-Sulami provides the forum for another operation critical to the construction of the ta'ifa : the assertion of Sufi superiority at the expense of the other competitors for the Prophetic legacy. Al-Sulami's Sufis de- nounce not only Hadith-scholars but Qur'an-readers, as in this statement attributed to Ahmad b. Abi al-Hawari: The Qur'in-memorizers astound me ! They recite the speech of God - how can they sleep at night, or occupy themselves with anything of this world ? If only they understood what they were reciting, and grasped it truly, and delighted in it, and thrilled to the sound of it in their own ears, they would so rejoice in the gift and the guidance they had been given that they would never sleep. (68) Perhaps because of his withdrawal from Hadith circles, Bishr in par- ticular became the mouthpiece for anti-scholarly sentiment not only in biographies by such Sufis as AbO Nu'aym al-Isfahini but even in works by general biographers such as al-Khatib al-Baghdidi. "Pay the alms-tax on Hadith !" Bishr is supposed to have said: "For every two hundred [you relate], put five into practice (69) !" Abo Nu'aym even attributes to Bishr the following counter-etiological narrative: I heard AbO Nasr Bishr b. al-Hfrith say in reference to learning and scholarship : Unless it is put to [pious] use, then it is better to leave it alone... (65) Abf 'Abd al-Rahmin al-Sulami (d. 412/1021), Tabaqdt al-sfifya, ed. N. D. Shariba (Cairo, 1953), lff. (66) These pronouncements, like the Prophetic Hadith, contain maxims of good conduct, either by direct command or in the form of generalities ; expressions of the speaker's prefe- rences or emotions, with ethical implications; enumerations of people blessed or cursed; and cryptic predictions. The authoritativeness of these statements presumably derives from the "knowledge through God" spoken of by the theorists and biographers, and would seem to be at least theoretically equal to that of the Prophetic Hadith.

(69) Abu Nu'aym, Hilya, 8:336. 87</page><page sequence="18">MICHAEL COOPERSON He went on to say that the Prophet conveyed [knowledge] to his Companions, who clung to it, preserved it, and acted in accordance with it. They in turn conveyed it to others - whose learning he praised - and who conveyed it in their turn to others. AbQ Nasr [Bishr] mentioned the three tabaqat [genera- tions], and then said, "And now knowledge has fallen to a crowd who use it to earn a living (CO). This capsule history of scholarly piety begins with premises with which the scholars would agree but then strikes at the legitimacy of their ta'ifa by attaching a different ending to the story. Like his fellow Sufis, however, Bishr attacks only the students of Hadith, not the Hadith itself: "The blot upon Hadith is the people who study it (71) !" Bishr's particular objection is to making money by teaching Hadith, or in general to putting one's knowledge to some worldly pur- pose. One report has him begin to recite a Hadith, then interrupt himself saying "God forgive me ! It has reached me that 'so-and-so related to me on the authority of so-and-so' is one of the gates leading to worldly gain". In another report he proclaims: "No one should mention any Hadith in a situation where he has some worldly need and [can use the Hadith] to help him get what he needs (72)". Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, though himself a Hadith-scholar, follows Abu Nu'aym in attributing to Bishr stinging criticism of the Hadith-folk. He cites Bishr's warning to 'Ubayd al-Warraq: "'Ubayd ! Beware 'hadda- thanc~' ["He related to us ; introducing a Hadith], for there is a certain sweetness to it. You have said 'haddathana and people wrote it down, but what ever came of it ?" (73) Hadith, Bishr says, has become just another means for attaining worldly ends; he cannot imagine how its students, or those who memorize it, will be saved; nor why those who memorize it do so at all. He prays God to make him forget all the Hadith he has ever memorized, and hopes to bury his books while he can. Hadith is "no weapon by which to gain the Next World, nor is it proper preparation for the grave" (74). Certainly some Hadith-scholars (including Ibn Hanbal) also disapproved of accepting money for teaching Hadith, but statements such as Bishr's go far beyond what even the most scru- pulous scholar could concede. Birsh's anti-Hadith sentiments appear to have accumulated with time; al-Sulami does not mention them, and the later biographers do. Indeed, the most direct articulation of them appears in a speech credited to Bishr by the tenth/sixteenth century Sufi biographer al-Sha'rani : "O evil (70) AbQ Nu'aym, Hilya, 8:340-341.

You are the heirs of the Prophets ; they bequeathed knowledge to you, but you have weaselled out of living by it ! You have made your learning a trade to live by. Aren't you afraid to be the first into the Fire ?" (75) That is, Bishr accepts the scholars as fellow heirs, but charges them with dereliction of duty. Having been a conspicuously renunciant IHadith-scholar was not enough to make Bishr a good Sufi. To serve the purposes of his biogra- phers, Bishr had to reject his former affiliation as well. This does not make his later persona entirely fictive : his piety and asceticism (attested by the sensible Ibn Sa'd) doubtless made him one of the exemplars upon which later theorists came to base their ideal of Sufism, and his break with the Hadith-scholars may have seemed emblematic of the Sufi strug- gle to constitute its own independent genealogy of authority. Once the ideal crystallized, however, it could be used as a template for the writing and rewriting of Bishr's life story independent of the sources. Having already constructed handy lists of saintly attributes (6), biographers could use their lists to describe Bishr as they imagined he must have been, certainly an easier task than writing about him as he was. Indeed, within a century of al-Sulami's Tabaqdt, biographies of Bishr begin sprouting apothegms, speeches, manifestations, and miracles, all without visible roots in the antecedent tradition. Among the most popular accretions was the tale of Bishr's conversion. In one of its recensions, the tale makes explicit what in Ibn Hanbal's case could only be uttered by a detractor, namely, that the hero's heirs- hip to the Prophet has brought him dangerously close to sharing the latter's august station : I heard someone ask Bishr b. al-Hdrith : "How did your career start ? - because it's as if your name among the people were the name of a prophet". He said: "It was by the grace of God. What can I tell you ? I was a hooligan ('ayyar) and the head of a gang (C). I was crossing [the street] one day and noticed a piece of paper in the road. I picked it up and found there 'In the Name of the Merciful and Compassionate God.' I wiped it off and put it in my pocket.

(77) AI-Khatib al-Baghdidi cites Bishr's uncle as saying: "Bishr was born in one of the villages of Marw... He used to run with a gang (yatafattd) in his youth, and was wounded" (Ta'rikh, 7:67). However, Ibn Khallikdn (d. 681/1282) calis Bishr min abnd' al-ru'asd' wa 1-kataba, "descended from notables and scribes" (Wafayit al-a'yin, ed. I. 'Abbs, [Beirut, 1968-721, 1:275) ; similarly, al-Dhahabi (Siydr, 10:474) cites al-Sulami as saying that "Bishr was descended from chiefs" (kan Bishr min awlad al-ru'asd). The two claims need not be contradictory. On Lapidus'view ("Separation") of ninth-century Baghdad politics, the sympathy between Bishr and Ibn Hanbal would have arisen from their Khurasdni ties; but see the response by Madelung in "Vigilante Movement". 89</page><page sequence="20">MICHAEL COOPERSON I had two dirhams with me, which were all I owned, and I went to the perfumers and spent [the dirhams] on a bottle of scent, which I rubbed on the paper. "That night I fell asleep and dreamed that someone was saying to me: "Bishr b. al-Harith ! You have lifted Our Name from the ground and perfumed it, and We shall exalt your name in this world and the next !" "Then everything that happened" (78). In this account, Bishir saves the name of God from being trodden upon in the public road, in return for which God promises to exalt his name in this life and the next. But Bishr, like Ibn Hanbal deplored his worldly fame: in a letter to his uncle, he describes his notoriety as "a great calamity indeed (79)". As his biographers represent him, Bishr fea- red - despite God's promise - that present fame would bring him future grief. "The man who wants people to know him", one of his sayings runs, "will never taste the sweetness of the next world" (80). Terrified of losing Paradise, Bishr avoided the company not only of admirers but of people in general ; and when he could not avoid them, refused to engage them in conversation. Like Ibn Hanbal, however, he could not escape his fame, even in the unlikeliest of places. [Ayyub al-'Attar :] One Friday, Bishr and I left the congregational mosque and passed through the alley of Abu al-Layth, where there were children playing [ball] with coconuts. When they saw Bishr they cried, "Bishr ! Bishr !" snatched up their coconuts and scampered away. Bishr stood still a moment, then said, "What heart could bear such a thing ? I shall never set foot in this alley again until I meet my Maker !" (81) Sufi biographers used such anecdotes to flesh out the picture of a saintly Bishr, a characterization that both illustrated and legitimized the existence of the ti 'ifa of Sufis. While al-Sulami (in the Tabaqdt, at least) hardly ever establishes a context for the hik-ayCt he attributes to his subjects, later biographers tend to show Bishr and his contemporaries in concrete and often quotidian situations such as "leaving the mosque one Friday", a detail that subtly reinforces the Sufi biographers' conten- tion that good Sufis were first and foremost observant Muslims. Bishr's reaction to the children's awe of him emphasizes his aversion to noto- riety and, whether intentionally or not, also illustrates his characteristic reaction to uncomfortable situations: he avoided them. An Ibn Hanbal might have used his reputation to sway his fellows in the direction of right belief and practice (which the imatm, in spite of his aversion to (78) Abi Nu'aym, Hilya, 8:336. Cf.

One has the impression that biographers described Bishr's flight from the world with approval. Only during the events of the Inquisition, as we shall see, did anyone challenge the propriety of Bishr's non- engagement with the world. V. The Comparison Ibn .Hanbal attained a painful notoriety by succeeding all too well - although never perfectly - in his aspiration to emulate the Prophet as completely as possible and by defying the 'Abbitsid imposition of the doctrine of the created Qur'an. Bishr attained an equally painful notoriety by striving to renounce the world; his feats of self-denial - like Ibn Hanbal's - provoked the admiration of his contemporaries, which in turn drove him into an more extreme (and more admirable) seclusion. Ibn Hanbal at least took consolation in having stood against tyranny for the sake of right belief, while Bishr could claim to have demonstrated that the Hadith-scholars did not enjoy a monopoly on righteousness. In all their similarities and differences, the two men correspond re- markably well to Weber's two types of ascetics, the "inner-worldly asce- tic" and the "world-rejecting mystic" (82). In Weber's formulation, the inner-worldly ascetic (Ibn Hanbal) regards himself as "the elect instru- ment of God", whose quest for merit consists in opposing the almost irretrievably corrupt institutions of the world. On the other hand, the world-rejecting mystic (Bishr) regards himself not as the instrument but as the "vessel" of God ; he flees mundane interests altogether in search of "rest in [G]od and in him alone" (83). Weber's account is particularly illuminating because it treats not only the two types of "religious virtuo- sos", but their perception of each other. The ascetic tends to regard the mystic's state of contemplation as "indolent, religiously sterile, and as- cetically reprehensible self-indulgence", while the mystic deplores the ascetic's ethical struggles as "a perpetual externalization of the divine in the direction of some peripheral function" (84).

Bishr, a contemporary of Ibn Hanbal, cannot be called a "precursor" of Hanbalism; but he and the imim were in broad agreement on the "Hanbali" convictions Chabbi attributes to Fudayl. Given this agreement, Bishr, Ibn Hanbal, and their partisans would have been especially sensitive to any differences in opinion or emphasis. 91</page><page sequence="22">MICHAEL COOPERSON Ibn Hanbal on various occasions spoke disapprovingly of certain con- temporaries later termed Sufis, among them Dhfi al-Nfin al-Misri, al-Sari al-Saqati, and al-HIrith al-Muhasibi. But as Henri Laoust has pointed out, it was kaldm (theosophical speculation) and not "Sufism" that Ibn Han- bal most objected to (85). Regarding the imim's relationship to al- Muhasibi, for example, Ibn al-Jawzi says when the latter "made certain statements in the field of kalam, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal cut off relations with him" (86). Ibn Hanbal does not appear to have found any kaklm to object to in Bishr's statements. He did, however, reproach him for ne- glecting the most elementary form of social engagement : "Had he mar- ried", said the im.m of Bishr, "his career would have been perfect" (87). Bishr's opinion of Ibn .Hanbal seems to have at least equally benign and in many cases positively enthusiastic, as we shall see. However, the mystic's constant denigration of adith-scholarship (referred to above), particularly because of the worldly orientation of its practitioners, signals his rejection, if not of Ibn Hanbal himself, at least of a major constituent of the latter's style of piety (88). Had Ibn Hanbal and Bishr represented the only two heirs of the Prophet in Baghdad, they may well have pursued a more acrimonious line of interchange. However, it appears that the presence and activities of a third thi'ifa, that of the caliphs, provoked something of an entente between the two ; and, perhaps more importantly, provided biographers with a standard for comparing the two men. For biographers as well as (apparently) the protagonists themselves, the decisive event proved to be the Inquisition. The sources agree that Bishr supported the doctrine of the uncreated Qur'an. On the subject of those who capitulated to the Inquisition, he is supposed to have said: "They should have let their hair be soaked with blood rather than give in" (89). He is also shown telling the story of how Ibn Hanbal refused his interrogators' request to copy the sentence "God is the Lord of the Qur'an". "If he had", says Bishr, "he would have given them what they wanted" (90). But all this is retrospective: no evi- dence exists to show that Bishr ever expressed his support for Ibn IHanbal during the year before the flogging. 92 (85) Henri Laoust, "Le hanbalisme sous le caliphat de Bagdad", Revue des ,tudes islami- ques 27 (1959), 67-128, at 70-71.

(90) Al-Dhahabi, Svyar, 11:258.</page><page sequence="23">IBN HANBAL AND BISHR AL-HAFI Furthermore, a recurrent report specifically mentions Bishr's decision not to intervene during the flogging. The report states that when news of Ibn .Hanbal's ordeal reached Bishr's associates, they asked him to intercede on the scholar's behalf, but he refused. Most significantly, it also documents the renunciant's apparent concession of the prophetic legacy to the scholar. The most complete version of the report runs as follows : When Ahmad Ibn Hanbal was flogged, the students/associates (as.bib) of Bishr b. al-HTrith said to him, "Abu Nasr, if only you would appear publicly and say that you are of Ahmad Ibn Hanbal's opinion". He said, "Do you want me to stand where the prophets stand (aqama maqama 'I-anbiya) ? Ahmad Ibn Hanbal has stood where the prophets stand !" (9) Bishr concedes that Ibn Hanbal's defiance of the Inquisition is the work of prophets, work that he - Bishr - can never perform. His des- cription of Ibn lHanbal alludes to the idea that it is the prophet's task to confront tyrants, as Moses confronted Pharaoh (92). His comparison of Ibn IHanbal to a prophet therefore amounts to a ratification of the imdm's claim to authority on the basis of his figurative descent from Muhammad, and by extension, of the claims of the whole ta'ifa of Hadith-scholars on the basis of their status as repositories of the Prophet's Hadith and conspicuous adherents to his Sunna. It also reflects poorly on the claims of the caliphs, who as khulafa7' Rasil Allah could make their own claim to "standing where the prophets stand". Unwilling to engage himself in the affairs of the world, Bishr refused to make a public statement in support of Ibn Hanbal. Whether out of contrition or conviction, however, Bishr later expressed lavish admira- tion of Ibn IHanbal's steadfastness under torture. "He was placed in the furnace", says Bishr, "and emerged a chunk of red gold (93)". In one report, Bishr is even shown deploring his own passivity: extending his (91) Ibn al-Jawzi, Mandqib, 117-118. Ibn 'Asdkir's version runs: "[Bishr] was asked: "Shouldn't you have done as Ahmad [Ibn Hanball did ?" He responded: "You want me to stand at the level of the prophets (martabat al-nabiyin), but my body is not strong enough. May God guard Ahmad before him, behind him, from above and below, and on his right and left" (Ta'rikh, 1:34). (92) A Prophetic Hadith states that "the bestjihacd is righteous speech before an oppres- sive ruler" (Ibn Hanbal, Al-Musnad, ed. A.M. Shdkir [Cairo, 1373:1954] 5:251, 256, and cited by al-Dhahabi in his biography of the imdm, Siyar, 11:233). However, this is presumably true for any believer, not only for prophets, meaning that Bishr has no excuse. A. Kevin Reinhart has pointed out that the 'ulamd' used the term "maqdgm al-anbiyid" to refer to the status of the legist when he delivers a ruling or opinion (see Reinhart, "Transcendence", 9-10). Given the early date of Bishr's supposed statement, however, it is unlikely that he meant by "those who occupy the Prophet's place" the 'ulamn' in the later, technical sense of the term. (93) Ibn al-Jawzi, Manedqib, 170. 93</page><page sequence="24">MICHAEL COOPERSON leg, he is supposed to have exclaimed, "How ugly this leg is without a fetter upon it in defense of that man (94) !" Another account, which appears only in Ibn al-Jawzi's biography of Ibn Hanbal - not, that is, in any of Bishr's own biographies - takes this idea a step further: [Abfi Hdtim :] On the day Ahmad [Ibn Hanbal] was flogged, I said, "I'll go and find out what happened to him". I arrived early and found an old man saying, "God, strengthen him! God, help him !" He continued like one distraught, saying "[Tell me] if [Ibn Hanbal] capitulates, and I'll go in and take his place". Someone came out and said, "He didn't capitulate". "Thank God !" said [the old man]. "Who is that ?" I asked someone. "Bishr b. al-Hdrith", I was told (95). The anecdote does not specify the source of Bishr's distress: is he supposed to be feeling pity for Ibn Hanbal, remorse over his own failure to be there with (or instead of) him, dread of a flogging should he carry out his promise, or anguish because he knows he never will ? The his- torical Bishr may have felt some or all of these emotions. At any rate, members of his adopted td'ifa at one time or another seem to have felt all of them. Yet all these expressions of solidarity did little to improve some people's opinion of Bishr. His comments from the sidelines, ho- wever appreciative, could not efface the memory of his passivity. The remarks of one Muhammad b. Mus'ab al-'Abid summarize the anti-Bishr point of view: "Any one lash that fell upon Ahmad Ibn Hanbal for the sake of God is greater than [all] the days of Bishr b. al-HIrith (96)". Accounts such as this tip the moral scales heavily in favor of the t.d'ifa of Hadith-scholars. However, biographical traditions shirked unambi- guous declarations of the superiority of one td'izfa over another. If no- thing else, the recalcitrant presence of the rival td'ifa in the real world would have made any purely literary settlement appear contrived and unrealistic. The mouthpiece for the Hanbali counter-concession to the Sufis is Ibn Hanbal himself : instead of berating Bishr for staying at home, the imdm responded to Bishr's praises by characterizing the mystic's approval as the standard by which his actions are to be judged: "Ibn Hanbal learned of [Bishr's praise], and said 'Praise God Who caused our deed to gratify Bishr' (97". More subtly, Hanbali biographers appear to (94) Ibn al-Jawzi, Mandqib, 119. (95) Ibn al-Jawzi, Mandlqib, 336. No other report places Bishr so close to the site of the flogging. Calling him a shaykh is at any rate accurate enough; Bishr would have been over sixty years old in 219/834. (96) Ibn al-Jawzi, Mandqib, 173. (97) Ibn al-Jawzi, Mandqib, 117. 94</page><page sequence="25">IBN HANBAL AND BISHR AL-HAFI have used the example of Bishr to justify the im.m's suspicious refusal to teach IIadith after the Inquisition. Complaining that people pester him constantly to recite Hadith, Ibn Hanbal is shown declaring that "the right way is that of Bishr b. al-IHrith", referring to Bishr's well- documented refusal to teach (98). In a more general vein, biographers of both men show the scholar praising the mystic as "a man who has planted a spear in the earth and sat upon the point, leaving no room there for anyone else (99)", and even as one of the seven great saints of the age (100). Not to be outdone in the exchange of compliments, Bishr is said to have proclaimed : "Who am I compared to AbO 'Abd Allih [Ibn Hanbal] ? He is more learned than I (101) !", an admission itself likely to have endeared Bishr to the Hadith scholars. Such instances of mutual admiration eventually accumulated to the point where even the Hadith- minded rigorist al-Dhahabi declines to pronounce in favor of one man over the other. "I say: Bishr is great, as Ibn Hanbal is great (Bishr 'azim al-qadr ka-Ahmad). We do not know the weight of deeds, only God does (102)". Strangely enough, an early Sufi report implies that Bishr did have a right to intercede on Ibn Hanbal's behalf. According to al-Sulami, one of al-Ma'min's chief judges quoted the Caliph as saying: "There remains in this town no one before whom one need be abashed except for that shaykh, Bishr b. al-Harith (103)". Al-Ma'mon's expression of deference to the mystic implies that had Bishr actually challenged him or his successor al-Mu'tasim, he might have been able to sway one or the other from his heretical course. No such event occurred, and it is difficult to imagine how it could have been managed, but within the world constructed by the biographical tradition - a world governed by a system of checks and balances among representatives of different tdu'ifas - this report, juxta- posed with later reports from both the Sufi and scholarly traditions, implies transitive and circular relationships of deference among the com- peting ta'ifas. The Sufi defers to the Hadith-scholar, who in turn submits (98) Al-Dhahabi, Siyar, 11:258. (99) Al-Khatib al-Baghdidi, Ta'rkbh, 7:73. (100) Rdtbtu sab'atin min al-abdcl.

A later report from the Sufi tradition illuminates the relationship bet- ween the Sufi and scholarly tc.'ifas, at least as it was imagined by bio- graphers. This report brings one of Bishr's three sisters - identified in some accounts as Mukhkha - who is shown following the practice of many Baghdadis by asking Ibn HIIanbal's opinion on a matter of pious practice : It is related that [Mukhkha] went to see Ahmad Ibn Hanbal and said, "In our household we make our living spinning [cotton] at night. Often the torches of the Banfi Thhir - the Baghdad authorities - pass by as we're sitting on the roof, and we spin a length or two in the torchlight. Do you declare this permitted for us, or forbidden ?" He said, "Who are you ?" She said, "Bishr's sister". "O family of Bishr ! May I never be deprived of you ! I always hear the purest scrupulosity from you (105) !, Mukhkha's question relates to the permissibility of using illumination provided by an unjust governor (106), suggesting that the "family of Bishr" concurred with Ibn Hanbal in looking askance at the authorities even when the latter (unintentionally) provide a public service (10). The re- port confirms that Sufi scrupulosity, like its Hanbali counterpart, carried with it a whiff of anti-regime sentiment (albeit much subtler than in (104) A late and curious report shuffles the terms of this relationship. The report states that Bishr "attained such high degree that al-Ma'mon asked Ibn Hanbal to intercede for him and seek permission for him to visit [Bishr], but [Ibn Hanbal] refused" (Zakariya 'al-Ansiri [d. 926/1520], Sharh al-Risala al-Qushayriya [Damascus, n.d.], 1:88; Al-Munawi, Kawdkib, 1:208). This flies in the face of the historians' consensus that al-Ma'moin and Ibn Hanbal never met (a fact biographers attributed to the Imam's pious hope that no such meeting would ever occur) ; moreover, al-Ma'min was hardly one to ask a favor of Ibn Hanbal, whom he consi- dered an ignoramus (al-Tabari, Ta'rikh, ed. M. A. F. Ibrahim (Cairo, 1389/1976], 8:641-642). Nevertheless, it illustrates that biographers and readers had come to regard Bishr, Ibn Hanbal, and al-Ma'mfin less as historical individuals than as exemplars of their respective td'ifas. For later (prescriptive) formulations of these relationships, see Louise Marlow, "Kings, Prophets, and the 'Ulama in Mediaeval Islamic Advice Literature", Studia Islamica 81:1 (1995), 101-120. (105) AbQ Nu'aym, Hilya, 8:353. (106) I am indebted to Prof Aron Zysow for this interpretation. Other versions use a different wajh, removing the anti-regime element: Ibn Hanbal tells her she should sell her yarn at different prices if there is a difference between the yarn spun in the torchlight and that spun in the moonlight (Ibn al-Jawzi, Sifat al-safwa, 2:290 ; Ibn Khallikdn, Wafayat, 1:276). (107) Similarly, the Twelver Shi'i biographical tradition represents Sufis as colluding in Imamic disapproval of the caliph's authority. See, e.g., Ibn Bibawayh, 'Uyt2n, 2:239-40, where 'Ali al-Ridi looks on approvingly as an unnamed Sufi castigates al-Mamin for misusing public funds and hints to the Imim that he (the Sufi) sympathizes with the plight of the Prophet's descendants. 96</page><page sequence="27">IBN HANBAL AND BISHR AL-HAFI 'Att.r's diverting fictions about ninth-century mystics rebuking the 'Abbdsid caliphs). Like Bishr's admiration for Ibn HIanbal in the wake of the Inquisition, this report hints at a tacit agreement between the Hadith- scholar and the Sufi regarding the low moral standing of the regime. More importantly, the Mukhkha-tale reveals how adept the biogra- phical tradition had become at constructing tales that encoded complex relationsphips of mutual deference. Mukhkha's concern for a fine point of scrupulosity reveals the extent of her - and by extension her brother's - personal adherence to the Sunna, while her visit to Ibn Hanbal de- monstrates the family's deference to his authority in matters of religion. At the same time, her appearance saves Bishr from having to defer to the imam in person, an act which would unambiguously settle the ques- tion of heirship to the Prophet in favor of the Hadith-scholars. Ibn Hanbal vindicates Bishr's style of piety while allowing the mystic to preserve that air of cryptic sanctity without which the Sufi td 'ifa would be unable to compete with - or complement - the attainments of the scholars. This preoccupation with establishing inter-t 'ifa cordiality appears even in the postmortem dream-tales, commonly cited by biographers as evidence for their subjects sanctity. In a typical report, Abfi 'Abd Allah b. Khuzayma, after hearing of Ibn Hanbal's death, falls asleep and sees the imam swaggering through Heaven. "Why are you walking that way ?" he asks, and Inb Hanbal responds: "This is how the servants walk in Heaven". He adds that God has forgiven him, placed a crown on his head, and given him sandals of gold, "all because [I] said that the Qur'an is the uncreated speech of God", referring to the Inquisition. Ibn Khu- zayma then inquires what has become of Bishr. Ibn Hanbal replies: "Bravo for Bishr ! I left him in the presence of the Almighty, before a laden table, with the Almighty facing him and saying, 'Eat, you who never ate ! Drink, you who never drank! Enjoy, you who never knew anjoy- ment (108) !" This account confirms what the deference-anecdotes have already suggested: that Ibn Hanbal, and by extension the td'ifa of Hadith scho- lars he represents, acknowledge Bishr's piety, and by extension, the propriety of his Sufi t,'ifa's claim to authority; and that Bishr, in turn, accords Ibn Hanbal and his colleagues the same respect. Dream-tales such as this one provided biographers an opportunity to reconcile the claims of the two tda'ifas and affirm the rightness of both styles of piety. After all, the Prophetic legacy and the tdc 'zfa-system that grew up around (108) Abu Nu'aym, Hilya, 9:190; cf. al-Qushayri, Risdla, 19. The reader will have noticed the importance of food in the biography of both men - justified, perhaps, in view of Adam's fall from Paradise for the tasting of a fruit (Qur'in 7:20-22; 20:120-121). Notably, it is men who behave this way; cf. Caroline Walker Bynum, Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The religious significance offood to medieval women (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987). 97</page><page sequence="28">MICHAEL COOPERSON it presumably existed only for the benefit of the earthbound community of believers. Once dead and in Paradise, the representatives of the va- rious td'ifas should find themselves quit of their obligation to stand as living exemplars for any particular style of piety. Ibn Khuzayma's dream- tale appears to depict just such an outcome. Althought Ibn Hanbal and Bishr each gained Paradise in his own way - the former by defending the Qur'an against the Inquisition, and the latter by rejecting worldly pleasures - their immortal souls need no longer feel the constraint of their former allegiances. Indeed, the dreamer reports that Ibn Hanbal's soul approves of Bishr, and we may assume that Bishr's soul reciprocates the imam's generous sentiment. Not all post-mortem dream-anecdotes evince this sort of accommo- dationism. In many cases, biographers used them simply to affirm the rightness of the way of life espoused by their respective exemplars. In such cases, dreamers, biographers, or both, insisted on importing into Heaven the same standards they found, or wished to find, on Earth. In the case of Bishr, two reports claim that he carried his renunciation with him even into the afterlife. When asked by a dreamer how he found Paradise, Bishr in one account replies "I miss my crust (109)", and in another, "[God] realized how little I value food, so He granted me the privilege of gazing upon His gracious countenance instead (110)". As for Ibn Hanbal, dreamers place him in the role of guard at the gates of Paradise, thereby extending his earthly role as the standard of right belief. Numerous reports already affirm that Ibn Hanbal's approval or disappro- val constituted a sure index of a believer's fate in the afterlife, and conversely that "one's opinion of Ibn Hanbal works as a test to distin- guish the Muslim from the heretic (111)". After the imam's death, accor- dingly, a dreamer reports a vision of a Resurrection Day when only those carrying Ibn Hanbal's signet-ring are permitted to cross the bridge to Heaven. Another reports that Heaven is guarded by four horsemen : the angels Jibril, Mika'il, and Israfil, and Ibn Hanbal: "God has given [Ibn Hanbal] the banner and put him in charge of the Garden of Eden, to admit only those he loves (112)". The tendentious nature of such reports makes them subject to the same constraint that governs the earthbound anecdotes, namely, to avoid any direct statement that the salvation of one tc'ifa necessarily implies the salvation or damnation of another. We are not told, for instance, whether Ibn Hanbal admitted Bishr into Heaven, or whether (109) Al-Khatib al-Baghdidi, Ta'rikh, 7:80. (110) Ibn Khallikdn, Wafayat, 1:65.

(112) Ibn al-Jawzi, Mancdqib, 446-447. 98</page><page sequence="29">IBN HANBAL AND BISHR AL-HAFI Ibn .Hanbal was allowed to join Bishr in his contemplation of the coun- tenance of God. This silence arises from the same reticence that kept biographers from showing the two exemplars together when in life. Any one of the necessary constituents of the anecdote - the physical setting, the place- ment of the actors, the forms of address used - would necessarily en- code, and amount to a declaration of, the superiority of one man over the other. Should one man, for example, visit the other, he would the- reby concede to him a higher rank. While the biographer could then balance the scales by declaring that the host immediately rose respect- fully in greeting, the situation after that - i.e., the depicted interchange between the two exemplars - would ramify into a sort of narrative chess game where every move by one side would have to be precisely coun- terbalanced on the other. As we have seen, biographers preferred to depict the relation of the two exemplars as taking place entirely through intermediaries. Even Ibn Khuzayma's report, which depicts both men as saved, places each in a different part of Paradise. Once deceased, Muham- mad's heirs act out a resolution each only hinted at while on earth : that both paths will indeed lead to salvation. Yet in biographies written by mortal men, the two exemplars almost never appear in the same place at the same time, even in Paradise (113). VI. Conclusions According to the "divisions of labor" proposed by fourth/tenth-century theorists and biographers, the Hadith-scholar Ibn Hanbal and the renun- ciant Bishr al-HIafi belonged to two distinct t,'ifas or communities of "knowers" and heirs of the Prophet. However, the two men had enough in common to make any such categorization somewhat arbitrary. Both were students of Hadiith and both were conspicuously renunciant, such that the fifth/eleventh century biographer Abu Nu'aym al-Isfahani saw no impropriety in including both of them in his catalogue of saints (awliy,). But as the ta'ifas became gradually better defined as literary and social entities, biographers labored to emphasize the distinctiveness - and, explicitly or implicitly, the superiority - of one td"'zfa over the other. This competitive self-awareness manifests itself in the shifting 99 (113) There are two exceptions, both supernatural. In one, the mystic Amina, mysteriously transported from Ramla, visits the ailing Bishr ; when Ibn Hanbal arrives on the same errand, she prays for them both (Ibn 'Asdkir, Ta'rikh, 2:48). In the other, the narrator dreams that Bishr sees Ibn Hanbal marching at the head of a procession, and rises to greet him (al-Maqdisi, Mibna, 140). Each report gives precedence to a different man, but both reports place both men among the sanctified elite.</page><page sequence="30">MICHAEL COOPERSON construction of biographical entries, including selection and presenta- tion of sources ; suppression, modification, and invention of anecdotes ; and stylistic effects, particularly the relations established between indi- vidual reports or sets of reports within the entry. In Ibn Hanbal's case, biographers took pains to establish that he never capitulated to the Inquisition, a claim practically indispensable to the .t'ifa's collective self-respect, but one that demanded sophisticated manipulation of the documentary evidence. In Bishr's case, biographers had to prove that their subject was a "knower" and a Sufi even though the man died at least half a century before either term had the technical meaning the biographers and theorists had in mind. In the course of these rewritings, biographers on both sides exploited the presence of a rival exemplar. Hanbali biographers, for example, em- phasized Bishr's failure to intervene on Ibn Hanbal's behalf during the Inquisition; and Sufi biographers, although they dared not impugn Ibn Hanbal directly, used Bishr as a mouthpiece for stinging criticisms of the Hadith-establishment. In each case, the denigration of the rival td'ifa served to shore up the home td'ifa's claim to authority. At the same time, biographers used rival exemplars as anecdotal fi- gures in accounts that encoded complex relationships of deference among representatives of the different td'zfas. For every subtle dig placed in the mouth of Ibn Hanbal or Bishr, one also finds an expression of admiration or concession of superiority. To some extent, this accomo- dationism owes its existence to the recalcitrant presence and proximity of the rival t'zifa, such that any purely literary assertion of incontestable superiority would be not only unconvincing but divisive. Moreover, both scholars and Sufis tacitly disapproved of their fellow-heir the caliph. Much of the mutual admiration attributed to Bishr and Ibn Hanbal occurs in the context of the caliphal Inquisition, which the mystic deplored in word and the scholar defied in deed. The various additions, suppressions, and manipulations biographers performed upon the life-stories of their heroes cannot be dismissed as simple revisionism. More precisely, the variety and subtlety of this par- ticular kind of revisionism leaves the reader with the impression that there was nothing simple about it. The gradual development of biogra- phical discourse, however tendentiously motivated, took place in accor- dance with complex and shifting convictions about the proper represen- tation of historical persons and the proper role of the collectivities to which they belonged. To apply the term "characterization" to this pro- cess is not to minimize the historical reality or significance of the per- sonalities in question, but rather to acknowledge that the depiction of real persons is as rule-governed as the depiction of imaginary ones. To take the recalcitrant detail of an individual's lived experience and rewrite it in light of grand theories of social order and personal salvation is as 100</page><page sequence="31">IBN HANBAL AND BISHR AL-HAFI much a literary enterprise as creating characters out of whole cloth. The fact that more may be at stake in the case of real people makes biography all the worthier of our attention.
