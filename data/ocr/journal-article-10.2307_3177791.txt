ROBERTSON When the lights dimmed in the Waikiki Shell on September 21, 1987, an audience of thousands rose to its feet to cheer the memory of kumu hula (master teacher) Darrell Lupenui. Hawai'ians filled the lawn of Honolulu's outdoor concert arena in a tribute to one of the great creative forces in the Hawai'ian renaissance move- ment. I was aware that we also were mourning the death of a prominent and respected mChMD-a person of mixed gender who had found sanctuary in the domain of Laka, god/goddess of the an- cient hula. Mafh' from the full continuum of gender variation and from every island of Hawai'i participated in Lupenui's memorial con- cert, both as members of the audience and as chanters and dancers. Some of them wore dog-tooth necklaces and silk tunics. Others sported jeans, T-shirts, and stacks of flower leis which they gave away to friends and family in one of the oldest gestures of aloha. MdhzU, with children along, translated some of the dance gestures and Hawai'ian words for them. Like the great musician they were honoring, these mahii em- body an ancient Polynesian principle of spiritual duality and in- tegration. The outer presentation of the mahii is usually female, even when the person is biologically male. In Women of Polynesia, Tui Terence Barrow describes the mahi2 as an "intermediate sex": Sex is to the Polynesians a very down-to-earth thing which need not be too much thought about and is certainly not repressed. Sometimes Mother Nature cannot make up her mind whether to make a man or a woman, even in Polynesia, so she mixes up a little of the male with some of the female ele- ment. In Polynesia transvestites in whom the male and female are not clearly differentiated, either at the physical or psychic level are called the mihiQ who, Feminist Studies 15, no. 2 (Summer 1989). ? 1989 by Feminist Studies, Inc. 313</page><page sequence="3">314 Carol E. Robertson although physically speaking more men than women, prefer to dress and act as women.' Transvestism is but one aspect of the mahl phenomenon, which defies reduction to any of the notions of gender familiar to us in the West.2 I have, for example, met several women who were raised as boys by their parents or grandparents. Mary Kawena Pukui has also documented cases in which girls were raised as boys to keep them free of sexual liaisons with men.3 In earlier days, these girls would have been considered kapu (taboo), and they would have been chosen for some special task, possibly associated with healing or with the performance of sacred hula. Several elderly men have told me that, after begetting many sons and no daughters, their parents decided to raise their youngest boy as a girl. In this way they sought to provide additional labor for women's tasks and insure a creative presence that otherwise might not have emerged in the imbalance of a homocentric household. This practice seems to date back to ancient times. Pukui notes an account by David Malo of a "hermaphrodite," or physically bisexual person, born during the time of Pa'ao, an im- portant high priest and religious revisionist of ancient Hawai'i. La'a-kapu, wife of a ruling chief of the island of Hawai'i, gave birth to a child of indeterminate sex, whom she named Ka-uhola-nui-a- mhili.4 This name could be interpreted on many levels, as is the case with all Hawai'ian words. One possible translation would be "the great unfolding of the mitha." Uhola means the kind of un- folding associated with receptivity, or the opening of the mind. This interpretation is consistent with another version of the origins of the mdh U. "The hermaphrodites - also referred to as mah!7 - said to have landed at Waikiki were respected men, talented priests of healing and the hula. Whether this is history or legend, it reflects attitudes of approval and admiration. ... Hawaiians always knew we had in us something feminine and masculine.'"5 The mahiD population today embraces an astounding variety of individuals. It can designate women who dress and work as men, men who dress and work as women, women or men who dress and act so as to obscure their biological classification, women who will only associate with other women, men who dress "festively," men who undergo hormone treatments and/or eventually change their sex surgically, true hermaphrodites, and women and men who might, in English, call themselves "gay." Any of these people</page><page sequence="4">Carol E. Robertson 315 may choose to procreate or to raise children through the tradi- tional adoption arrangement known as hanai. In fact, parents sometimes put their children in the care of mahii, for mixed gender individuals are recognized as special, compassionate, and creative. Because the mihU embody the synthesis of the female/male principle in Hawai'ian culture and cosmology, they have been in- timately associated with the Hawai'ian renaissance movement and the revival of the ancient hula tradition. As noted earlier, the deity Laka oversees the hula and is perceived by some practitioners as female and by others as a deity of mixed gender. Although men danced in the hula of ancient times, missionaries taught that danc- ing was unseemly and especially inappropriate for true males. Consequently, this tradition was handed down primarily through women and mahii and, until the Hawai'ian cultural renaissance of the 1970s, was associated with femaleness. However, dancers who trained under some of the great teachers of this cen- tury- Henry Pa, Edith Kanaka'ole, Ma'iki Aiu Lake-see the hula as an androgynous tradition. "Gender," as we might see it in the dance, is determined by the spiritual and aesthetic identity of the dancer. Thus, the same chant danced by a wahine (woman) would flow through her own energy; danced by a kane (man) it would carry his own stamp; and danced by a mahih it would fuse wahine and kine, probably favoring the female side because of the em- phasis on fluidity and grace. Female mahi presenting themselves as men are the only segment of this population which has not been active in the world of hula performance. Drawings and etchings made of hula dancers by eighteenth- century Europeans often portray the dancer as androgynous. This is especially true in the works of Louis Choris, who traveled the Pacific as a member of the late-eighteenth-century Russian expedi- tion led by Otto von Kotzebue. Choris's "Female Dancers of the Sandwich Islands" (fig. 2) is a striking example of ambiguous gender. The drawing by Jacques Arago of the seated female hula dancer (fig. 1) shows body tattooing similar to that of the men drawn by Choris in figure 3. As in other areas of Polynesia, tattoo- ing was a sign of high status. The bleached hair fringing the face of the seated dancer in figure 1 and of Queen Ka'ahumanu (p. 312) shows one of several hairstyles used by royal women in the early nineteenth century, and is one of the few distinguishing features of women's dress and adornment. In all three hula drawings, both</page><page sequence="5">316 Carol E. Robertson women and men are wearing the same kind of attire-the pa'u, made of kapa (bark) cloth. The kind of dancing shown in these ex- amples was under the patronage of the ali'i, or royalty, who were great composers and patrons of the arts. Through a sequence of unrelated historical circumstances, the subtly defined gender identification of Hawai'i's precontact women and men underwent radical transformations. After the 1819 death of Kamehameha I, who was responsible for the unifi- cation of the Hawai'ian islands, his widow, the powerful Queen Ka'ahumanu, abolished the old kapu system which was so re- pressive to women and commoners, and championed the right of women to communicate directly with the gods. In 1820, exactly one year after Ka'ahumanu had most of the old male temples destroyed, Calvinist missionaries arrived on Hawai'ian shores, bringing their own laws and kapu system. By the mid-nineteenth century, the missionaries had successfully imposed a "breast kapu" and had further undermined hula dancing by discouraging anyone from participating. Calvinist notions of propriety established the "overdressed" style shown in what is believed to be the first photograph of hula dancers, taken in 1858 (fig. 4). In the course of the nineteenth century, then, hula was at the same time feminized and largely pushed underground because its spiritual or "pagan" content was censored by the missionaries. Although, today, male dancers often shed their Victorian layers and dance in the bare-chested pa'u of old Hawai'i, women continue to observe the breast kapu of their invaders (fig. 5). Today the "overdressing" of the missionary age is often replaced by the mu'u mu'u (fig. 6). Some of the sacred hula chants and dances, and especially the mele ma'i, which represent and encourage procreation, have been handed down in a "hula underground." Most of the practitioners in this arena have been women and mahil. Family chants and hula gestures are often transmitted from grandmother to grand- daughter (fig. 6) or through prominent mahii in a lineage of dancers. Many mUhfa have a special link to the past that is manifested even in their physical presence. Many of those mlhil whose presentation of self defies gender classification are characterized by a corpulence that harks back to times of old, wherein massiveness in both women and men was equated with high status. Marshall Sahlins reminds us that in old Hawai'i the</page><page sequence="6">Carol E. Robertson 317 aesthetic of the m'ahi physique was rooted in the royal visage: "The ideal beauty of the chief is counterpart of his or her ideal potency. ... The high chief is 'divine,' as we should say ourselves: huge, fat- tened, skin lightened by protection from the sun, body glistening with perfumed oil, bedecked in the dazzling feather cape that is the treasure of his kingdom. And why not generate a kingdom on such a fundament? Existing only in the eye of the beholder, beauty is necessarily a social relationship.. .in Hawaii, beauty is placed as it were at the center of society, as a main principle of its organiza- tion."6 This aesthetic ideal can be witnessed in L. Massard's 1830 draw- ing of Nomahanna, one of the most famous beauties of the Hawai'ian Islands (fig. 7). Chiefess Nomahanna stood six feet and two inches tall and measured about forty-five inches around the waist. Royal women were often fattened through a combination of forced feeding and lomi-lomi (massage), for their girth was directly related to their status and power. According to Barrow, Tahitian chiefesses were often sent to "fat farms," where they could increase their size, rest, and socialize while protected from the harsh sun. Many contemporary Hawai'ians who follow the older ways through spiritual healing, ritual leadership, and hula retain the aesthetic of precontact Hawai'i. John Ka'imikaua, who worked closely with Darrell Lupenui, has been one of the leaders of the Hawai'ian spirituality movement. In figure 8, he leads his halau (hula school) in the 1987 celebration of the makahiki New Year festival at Waimea Falls Park. Most mlahii of great size are involved in the hula tradition as kumu-teachers, drummers, and chanters. Their girth, often ex- ceeding 500 pounds, is part of their beauty and mana, or spiritual power. These androgynous individuals stand in the community as a metaphor for the balance of female and male throughout Creation. Sadly, corpulence presents many dangers in the modern, urban context of Hawai'i. Darrell Lupenui, who in his thirty-six years of life influenced all his peers and many of his elders, was brought to his death by the kidney and heart complications occasioned by the seven hundred pounds he carried as both a gift and a burden. His life dramatized the complexities and the richness of the mdhii role in Polynesian cultures. Today, the ancient war temples lie in ruins, replaced by Pearl Harbor and the missiles of Kaho'olawe. Yet many Hawai'ians con-</page><page sequence="7">318 Carol E. Robertson tinue to bring gifts of flowers and food to the gods that linger in an- cient sacred sites. The guardianship of Mo'okini luakini (fig. 9), one of the few restored war temples on the island of Hawai'i, has passed to a woman, Auntie Leimomi Mo'okini Lum.7 On the northern coast of Kaua'i, hula devotees leave offerings on the altar of Laka (fig. 10). During the year, hula schools make their pilgrimage to this heiau to dedicate new students to the patron deity of the dance. These rituals come alive in the ever-changing web of gender and spirituality, and they bear witness to the belief systems that have allowed the mih~i to survive and flourish in the creative context of performance. NOTES 1. Tui Terrence Barrow, Women of Polynesia (Wellington, New Zealand: Seven Seas, 1967), 76. 2. The reader might note a certain linguistic awkwardness in the present article and the sources quoted. This reflects the limitations of our English vocabulary in a discussion of gender variation and the linguistic necessity of assigning a polarized female or male identity to every person. In Hawai'ian, by contrast, there are no female/male adjectives or articles, and proper names are also androgynous. In speaking of female or male gods, Hawai'ians emphasize the integration and balance of both energies. The notion of gendered polarity or opposition is foreign to their thinking. 3.
