<plain_text><page sequence="1">BERGERS ANIMALS BERGER'S CARNIVAL OF THE ANIMALS I By Alison Beale It has become important to pay close attention to John Berger's work, because in Britain, and more recently in other English-speaking countries, many confrontations about the visual in culture are fol- lowing patterns set by him. To give an example, the women's movement, perhaps more than feminist art critics and historians, owes a mixed debt to Berger for pointing out, through his analysis of modern advertising practices, the f etishi sation of the female form in Western Art. Berger has had the sustained imagination and the energy to make public issues out of a broad range of subjects, in pop- ular and scholarly essays, in fiction and in films. The books and programmes with which he has been associated have made it possible for teachers to introduce into schools the critique of visual cul- ture as a political practice, and as a topic that is not confined to art classes. As Berger' s work be- came more widely known and as the issues he raised were taken up, so his wsrk has become increasingly available for criticism. Perhaps now is the time for his critics, both hostile and sympathetic, to take into account, as part of their formation and effect, the circulation of Berger's ideas in the public context of their use, as well as their int- ernal dymanic and coherence. Both of these considerations have a bearing on the recent Omnibus programme, Parting Shots from Animals (BBC 1, March 4th. See John Wyver's review in Time Out Feb. 29th - Mar. 6th). Several scenes of human contact with animals - an abbatoir, kennels, a circus, a farm, a taxidermist's, a stuffed animal factory and an advertising agency - were used to illustrate the thesis that through our mistreatment of animals and our handling of their images, we humans are betraying our attitudes towards each other. The shock value of this idea turned on the presentation, not only of animals as à visual meta- phor for humans (in the kennel, in the abbatoir, as the Esso tiger) , but of humans as "animal conscious- ness" (the crew in animal masks at the beginning and at the end of the film, Berger's own voice in dis- embodied relation to a beautiful white horse) . This double cross-identification, to give credit to the film-makers, vgas not a naive exploitation of anthropomorphism; but if the film-makers raise the problem of identification and representation, in addition to using what could be a simple conceit to polemic ise man' s inhumanity, what are the limits to our c one lu s ion s ? A few questions. If the problem is man's inhum- anity, why use the animal metaphor? What are the real relationships between people and animals and how are they implicated in the use of such a meta- phor ? People can hunt, breed, and eat animals, use them for heavy work, play with them, study them, show affection to them, make pictures of them, worship them. As far as we are affected by them, animals can only play with, be affectionate to- wards, or eat, us. Any serious attempt to use the relationship between animals and people as an anal- ogy for our relationships to each other would seem to be posing an a-historical, biological inequality against an historical and cultural one. But the film isn't crudely doing this. Instead, the lived historical relationship between subject (human) and subject (human or animal) is abandoned in favour of a mode of address which "speaks" warningly through an animal voice coming from what are clearly human representations of animals (this including the film's own photography and editing) . Emanating from no- where other than from those representations, the voice mourns the loss of the equality of the "look" exchanged between humans and animals. But what shared look is this? A look of fear? of love? of use value? While deconstructing the Esso tiger ads, the film attempts itself to speak in a voice which, . coming from images , claims to represent "real" experience or knowledge. The image -animal ' s voice can be an effective and moving device, and it is humbly presented as nothing but that. There is a problem though, in that it disguises the historicity of the project that any criticism and interpretation clearly must be. The more serious problem is that the subjects the film is really concerned with are people, and peoples' experience cannot be "read" from images of them - if that is the function of images. With the best of intentions, John Berger's writing on peasants, and Jean Mohr' s photographs of them, can only be validated by the truth, the authenticity, which critical writing and photography can achieve. When Jean Mohr was asked about the way this worked, he could only refer to the friendship and trust between the peasants and Berger and himsèlf ( Screen Educat- ion 32/33, p. 24). A curious feature of all Berger's work on peasants (which has appeared also in Camera - work , New Society and Race and Class &gt; in addition to his book Pig Earth) is that it combines an ac- count of the final disappearance of peasants as a class (for example, an analysis of how they are being made landless throughout South America) with an attempt to get at and preserve their experience, which historical analysis won't yield by interpret- ing their "look" in pictures. This sort of problem, the critic's glance or stare at the subject's ex- perience, runs all the va y through Berger's work, and deserves all the more attention since the topics he raises are consistently politically important. In one of Berger's films (with Alain Tanner) , Le Milieu du Monde , a man's mistress threw away the camera he gave her because she knew the subjects in her daily life were trivial and unyielding, and because the camera represented exactly the way he dealt with her, as an image. In A Small History of Photography (One-Way Street) Walter Benjamin made it clear what photo- graphs are for, and how they really matter: "Sudden shifts in power such as are now overdue in our society can make the ability to read facial types a matter of vital importance. Whether one is of the left or right, one will have to get used to being looked at in terms of one's provenance. ... Will not the caption become the most important part of the photograph?". It would be a great loss strategically if prob- lems like this in Berger's most publicly access- ible work were to detract from its ongoing useful- ness (in Benjamin's terms) . On the morning follow- ing an evening news film of Japanese fishermen slaughtering dolphins, a self -de scribed member of the National Front called a London radio phone-in show to protest. Did we not know that each dolphin possessed £he soul of a drowned sailor? With ran- dom media sequences like this to interpret, we need all the help we can get, and Berger's a-historical identification with the non-human as a strategy for 'making-strange' the web of social relations within which humans live, is not as helpful as we have a right to expect from radical critics. 51</page></plain_text>
