<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHAEL LAVER Trinity College, Dublin Divided Parties, Divided Government The U.S. phenomenon of divided government has its counterpart in a parlia- mentary system as a result of the politics of coalition. One legislative coalition may put the executive in place, a different legislative coalition may sustain it in a vote of confidence, while yet another legislative coalition enacts measures that thwart its day-to-day business. I explain such division between executive and legislature by relaxing the party-as-unitary-actor assumption and recognise that executive and legislative elements of the same party may pursue different strategies. Party leaders may enter into commitments to coalition partners that involve implicit or explicit obligations to impose intraparty discipline. Leaders may do this with greater or lesser enthusiasm, and the required discipline may or may not be forthcoming. Thus, governments may be defeated in legislative votes because the legislature fails to honour obligations entered into by the executive. This paper sets out a simple model of this process, begins to analyse it, and elaborates a recent real-world example of the phenomenon. Relations between Legislature and Executive Every modern democratic regime relies fundamentally upon institutional linkages between a legislature, charged with representing the will of the people in the process of making the laws of the land, and an executive, charged with implementing these laws. A key distinction between types of democratic regimes concerns the sources from which these two branches of the governmental system derive their legitimacy and thence their right to be respected and obeyed by the public at large, even when particular decisions they make are unpopular. One model can be found in European-style "parliamentary government." In this model both legislature and executive share the same source of legitimacy-the periodic free election of public repre- sentatives to a legislature which in turn makes and breaks the executive. The executive in a parliamentary government system has no independent source of legitimacy, being indirectly responsible to the electorate via a representative legislature. An alternative model can be found in U.S.-style "presidential government." In this model both LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY, XXIV, 1, February 1999 5</page><page sequence="2">Michael Laver legislature and executive, each with significant overlapping powers, have independent sources of legitimacy-periodic free elections both to the legislature and to the position of chief executive. While there are many procedural and institutional details that separate presidential from parliamentary government systems, the key distinction we are concerned with here is the existence of shared versus independent sources of legitimacy for the legislature and the executive. What we think of as "divided government" is observed when gover- nance structures with independent sources of legitimacy have the potential to come into conflict. If there are significant overlapping powers between the two structures, then divided government creates the possibility of deadlock in the governmental system. There are several reasons why independent sources of legitimacy may come into conflict. Elections to different bodies may be held at the same time on different bases-perhaps using different constitu- ency structures or different electoral formulas. They may be held on the same basis on different dates, reflecting two different snapshots of public opinion. The may even be held at the same time on the same basis if voters "split their ticket" and use different criteria for making their choices in, for example, legislative and executive elections. A final, and for this paper, crucial source of conflicting legitima- cies can arise, even in a parliamentary system, as a result of the politics of coalition. When no one party wins a majority in the legislature, coalitions of parties are needed to secure legislative majorities. It can then happen that one particular legislative coalition puts the executive in place during the government formation process, a different legislative coalition might sustain the executive in a vote of confidence that decides its future, while yet another legislative coalition enacts measures that thwart or obstruct the day-to-day business of the executive. Such conflicts between legislature and executive are most likely to arise in European political systems when there are "minority" cabinets. Minority cabinets occur when the parties participating in the cabinet do not themselves control a majority of the legislature, despite having won the explicit or implicit support of a legislative majority in order to be installed in office.' It can then happen that members of a legislative majority leave the incumbent executive in place, not breaking the government in a confidence/no confidence motion despite having the legislative numbers at their disposal to do so, while continuing to vote against the government's legislative proposals. Laver and Shepsle (1991) explored the comparison between U.S.-style divided government and European-style minority government, and Strom (1990) provides an extensive treatment of minority government in Europe. 6</page><page sequence="3">Divided Party, Divided Government Another source of division between executive and legislature in parliamentary government systems can arise if we relax the party-as- unitary-actor assumption and lift the lid on intraparty politics. The making and breaking of governments may then pull different sections of the same party in different directions. Conflicts between legislature and executive may then become an intrinsic feature of internal party politics, as executive and legislative elements of the same party pursue different strategies in particular circumstances relevant to the future of a given government. In the extreme, parties may risk splitting over the making and breaking of governments while majority governments, even one-party majority governments, may find themselves defeated on particular legislative proposals as a result of the breakdown of party discipline. The focus of the argument that follows is upon this latter type of interaction between intraparty politics and the operation of parlia- mentary government. This interaction may result in conflict between legislature and executive that is the European equivalent of the U.S. phenomenon of divided government. Such conflict may become more common if there is a decline in the cohesion of political parties, with a consequent decline in the ability or willingness of cabinet ministers to deliver the legislative support of their party in a disciplined and pre- dictable manner. The result of this decline would be a narrowing of the gap between "divided" government U.S.-style and European "unified" government. Divisions within parties could manifest them- selves as divisions between legislature and executive. The next section reviews the interaction between intraparty politics and the making and breaking of European governments in general terms. The third section describes and begins to analyse a formal model of this interaction and explores some of its implications. The fourth section describes and analyses one recent confrontation between executive and legislature in the Netherlands, a confrontation brought about because executive and legislative branches of the same party behaved in different ways. The final section presents some more general thoughts about the link between intraparty politics and the potential for conflict between legislatures and executives in Europe. Party Discipline and Legislative-Executive Relations in Europe Most accounts of parliamentary government in modern Europe are explicitly or implicitly grounded in the assumption that political parties behave as unitary actors. This does not mean, of course, that 7</page><page sequence="4">Michael Laver those who write about parliamentary government are blind to the intricacies of intraparty politics. Rather it means that the unitary-actor assumption not only makes the modelling of many key political processes far more tractable, but it also seems to be an empirically reasonable working assumption, given the high levels of legislative party discipline we do tend to find in most parliamentary democracies. In reviewing the empirical plausibility of this assumption, for example, Laver and Schofield (1990) found that, whatever their internal decision- making processes, it was almost invariably the case that parties enter and leave governments as coherent units. It is almost never the case that only a section of a party joins a government while another section stays outside. Almost never does a section of a party leave a govern- ment while another section stays in office. This is an extremely strong empirical regularity-parties do seem to act as unified blocs when making and breaking governments. Some of the sources of coherence in the behaviour of political parties are analysed in Gary Cox's classic book, The Efficient Secret. This looks at the nineteenth-century evolution of modern party politics in Britain and emphasises the relationships between three closely interlocking processes (Cox 1987). The first is the emergence of a mass franchise in elections to a legislature increasingly concerned with public rather than private legislation-this underpinned the developing electoral value of a party label. The second is the consolidation of a unified system of government in which the executive is derived from the legislature-this established the primary career path to executive power as one of rising through the ranks of legislators. The third is the emergence of increasingly disciplined parliamentary parties, in which discipline is enforced by sanctions imposed by party hierarchs who both control access to the valuable party label and act as gatekeepers in the political career structure. While the political histories of different parliamentary govern- ment systems obviously differ, these processes are far more general in their implications. Stable parliamentary government depends crucially on the ability of the executive to forecast and rely upon stable voting alignments in the legislature. Given the size of most modern parlia- ments, this vital structuring of legislative behaviour is provided by the disciplined affiliation of legislators to political parties. Going one step further, by far the most straightforward way for an executive in a parliamentary government system to gain and main- tain power is for the cabinet to comprise senior members of one or more political parties that between them command the loyalties of a majority of legislators. We think of this as a "majority government." 8</page><page sequence="5">Divided Party, Divided Government Majority governments thus derive their character axiomatically from the ability of party leaders in the executive to command the loyalty of legislative party members, in other words, upon party discipline. Without such party discipline, the stability of the executive may be undermined. Thus, even a single-party government with a huge parliamentary majority can maintain its grip on power only by having a disciplined legislative party. If such a party splits in a significant way, and if the rebels are prepared to vote against the government, then even the most formidable of majorities may count for nothing. In this very real sense, every government is a coalition government. If it is not a coalition of different parties, then it is at least a coalition of factions within the single governing party-factions that may be explicit or implicit, with members whose preferences may well diverge in relation to particular issues, but who make the strategic decision to stay together within the same party. A good example of this can be found in the interaction between the Europhile and Europhobe wings of the British Conservative Party. Even at the height of the Conservatives' legislative majority, the issue of Europe always had the potential to split the Conservatives and destroy the government. Managing this potential confrontation was one of the most importantjobs of any Conservative leader who wanted to remain Prime Minister. Party discipline is also crucial to minority government, in which the parties in the executive do not themselves control a legislative majority, yet can nonetheless rely upon legislative support from parties outside the executive. The stability of such "outside" support obviously has a crucial bearing upon the stability of minority governments, a stability that is enhanced, other things being equal, if outside support is structured in disciplined blocs. Most theoretical accounts of parliamentary government, further- more, take political parties to be not only unitary actors but also as fixed elements of the political scene. Parties are treated as exogenous inputs to whatever process is being modelled, whether this is the making and breaking of governments, the fighting of elections, or anything else. Events that run counter to this view, for example party splits or (much less common) fusions between two parties, are typically treated as exogenous shocks to the system, not as endogenous outputs of party competition. All of this results in many political scientists taking a remark- ably anthropomorphic view of political parties. These are modelled in accounts of political competition as having "ideal points" and "indif- ference curves," for example, as if each party had a single brain. At 9</page><page sequence="6">Michael Laver best, the party is seen in these terms as a sort of insect hive, comprising physically distinct individuals but working intellectually to a single coherent design. Side-by-side with such simple models, there are obviously many "thickly descriptive" case studies of particular political parties that describe very complex internal processes. These accounts tend to be detailed stories of individual cases, however. Apart from being sources of inspiration for more generally applicable ideas, such thick descrip- tions do not yet form the basis of any more comprehensive account of party competition and parliamentary government. Lifting the lid off intraparty politics when we model interparty competition in a parliamentary government system is much more easily said than done, however. Nobody denies that it is an important project, but knowing how to go forward in a systematic and rigorous manner is another matter entirely. One of the more ambitious moves in this direction was made by Luebbert (1986) in an account of political parties that gave a central role to party leaders whose main motivation was to remain party leaders, who needed to win the intraparty political game in order to achieve this, and for whom interparty politics, even partici- pation in government, was a secondary concern. Luebbert's argument was informal. Laver and Shepsle (1996) attempted to build intraparty politics into a model of interparty com- petition over the making and breaking of governments, showing by example within their model of government formation that intraparty diversity of preferences, and variations in intraparty decision-making regimes, can have an impact upon the partisan composition of equilibrium governments. They fell far short, however, of proposing a rigorous model that fully integrated intraparty politics into interparty competition, implicitly demonstrating by example how very difficult this is going to be. I do not set out to propose such an overall model in this paper. Rather, I hope to put a piece of the puzzle into place. I do this by looking at one particular way in which relaxing the party-as-unitary- actor assumption has a bearing upon interparty competition in general, and the phenomenon of legislative-executive conflict in particular. This has to do with what happens if government parties cannot, or will not, discipline the actions of their members in the legislature. In other words, the discussions that follow treat intraparty discipline as an endogenous outcome of, rather than as an exogenous input to, interparty competition in parliamentary government systems. As we shall see, this will force us to reconsider what we understand by the concepts of majority and minority government, and in this way will hopefully throw new light on the phenomenon of legislative-executive conflict in Europe. 10</page><page sequence="7">Divided Party, Divided Government The Interparty Implications of Intraparty Discipline There are many different theatres of interparty competition; we tend to use different conceptions of a political party in each of them. Thus, if we are dealing with party competition in some local district during an election campaign, then we will be interested in party can- didates, party activists, and voters, with senior party politicians perhaps making an occasional appearance as part of a wider political game. We will quintessentially be interested in autonomous political actors who operate within political parties. Any notion of the party as a unitary actor will be utterly unsustainable. If, on the other hand, we look at the making and breaking of national governments in the period between elections, then we may well choose to concentrate upon interactions between quite a small number of elite politicians. We may even feel that we can tell a good enough story if we treat only party leaders as being autonomous political actors, and thus focus exclusively upon interactions between these people. In doing this we are not treating each party as a unitary actor in the sense that every aspect of a party's actions are determined by a single autonomous decision maker, but we are certainly treating each party as a unified actor in the sense that party members behave as iftheir actions were determined by a single autonomous decision maker. The traditional recourse of focusing on party leaders is clearly a product of the desire for analytical tractability. It is also, however, a political reality that when party leaders negotiate with each other over the making and breaking of governments, a key presumption is that, if they commit their party to a certain course of action, then they will be able to deliver. If party leaders cannot deliver on commitments that their parties will behave in certain ways, then the entire.system of parliamentary government has the potential to become chaotic and unpredictable. Lifting the lid on intraparty politics thus forces us to treat the making and breaking of governments as being determined by two interlocking political games, rather than as a simple interaction between party leaders. At one level, party leaders do interact with each other, as modelled by classical coalition theorists. At another level, each decision a party leader makes has to be carried through within the party's internal political system-and of course party leaders will anticipate the need to do this when making commitments to other party leaders. One important consequence of modelling the making and breaking of governments in terms of two interlocking political games is that a party leader's failure to deliver on commitments may be seen 11</page><page sequence="8">Michael Laver either as a straightforward reneging on the part of the leader, or as a political failure by the leader to carry the commitment within party. This failure to carry the party may further be the result of weakness, stupidity, lack of effort, or bad luck on the part of the leader. It may also have been anticipated quite accurately by a party leader who cynically made a commitment to others in the clear expectation that this could not be carried within his or her own party. This raises, as we shall see, the clear possibility of shirking by party leaders, who may not put in the effort needed to ensure fulfillment of commitments that have become inconvenient. These different potential reasons why a party leader might fail to honour commitments may well have a bearing upon how other political actors react to such failure. We quickly find ourselves in muddy strategic waters. We can attempt to make progress in this area by giving some shape to two political games that interact with each other. First, consider an interparty game that is in effect the one dealt with by classical coalition theorists. To keep things simple, concentrate for the moment on interactions between two parties over the making and breaking of governments. If these parties are negotiating to go into a coalition government together, then they negotiate a coalition agreement. This agreement may be more, or less, explicit. The ideal-type coalition agreement defines a mutually agreed strategy for each coalition partner in every foreseeable political circumstance, together with a procedure for dealing with unanticipated political shocks. Real-world coalition agreements will, of course, remain silent on many potential future political circumstances. There will probably be excellent strategic reasons for doing this. Two parties may, for example, be quite unable to agree upon what to do in some particular eventuality-but they may also be prepared to take a chance that this situation will not in fact happen. They may furthermore be unable to agree, before a government is formed, on what to do about something that they are almost certain will happen in the future, but may feel that the potential for future agreement between them will be greater once they have lived together in office for a while, and have thus learnt whether or not to trust each other. Failing to specify in advance a strategy for each coalition partner in some particular circumstance involves an implicit agreement to activate the default interparty negotiating procedure if this circum- stance arises. In this sense, we can think of any coalition agreement between two parties as being complete, even if it does not explicitly specify a course of action for all players in every conceivable political circumstance. 12</page><page sequence="9">Divided Party, Divided Government In general terms, therefore, an interparty coalition agreement specifies, for any given situation, either a course of action for each party or recourse to further interparty negotiations of some form. When the specified course of action involves more than just the party leader, and since all concerned do know that parties are not unitary actors, a coalition agreement at least implies the actions a party leader should take to ensure the compliance of his or her party to fulfill the agree- ment. However, much to the regret of many of them, no doubt, most party leaders are not all-powerful dictators within their own parties. This embeds an intraparty political game within the interparty game of making and breaking governments. For the purposes of developing a simple model, we can divide the actions available to a party leader when dealing with his or her own party into two categories: apply party discipline and allow independent decision making by internal party actors. In the context of voting behaviour in parliament, we can think of these choices as being apply party whip and allow free vote on the issue in question. Allowing a free vote imposes no further intraparty obligations on the leader involved in relation to the issue at stake. Mutual acceptance that a party leader may allow a free vote effectively takes the issue out of interparty politics. Applying the party whip, however, implies an obligation on the party leader to ensure that the whip is obeyed. This involves a cost, in terms of both intraparty and interparty credibility, if the whip is not, in fact, obeyed. The universal doctrine of collective cabinet responsibility in western European parliamentary systems means that, once some matter has been decided by coalition partners in cabinet, however controversial and divisive this decision was, then all cabinet members are collectively responsible for implementing the decision. This applies even to members who in cabinet discussions vigorously opposed the eventual option chosen. The only constitutional recourse for a cabinet member who cannot go along with a cabinet decision is to resign and oppose this decision from the opposition benches. In the context of parliamentary government and cabinet coalitions, the doctrine of collective cabinet responsibility translates into an obli- gation on the party leaders involved in cabinet decisions that they should do whatever it takes to deliver the compliance of their respective parties, unless otherwise specified. If a party leader loses a battle in cabinet and then does not raise a finger to deliver the support of his or her legislative party, then this would quite clearly be refusing to accept collective responsibility for implementing cabinet decisions. Such a situation would lead to the possibility that any cabinet decision, once 13</page><page sequence="10">Michael Laver taken, could be overturned in the legislature by an alliance of the losing party or parties in cabinet and members of the cabinet's legislative opposition. This implies that issues subject to a free vote and therefore not requiring legislative discipline on the part of government parties must be explicitly set out in a coalition agreement. Indeed, we might even take this to be one of the defining characteristics underpinning the system of party politics that makes parliamentary government viable. Therefore, in what follows, I concentrate upon those situations in which, explicitly or implicitly, the doctrine of collective cabinet responsibility imposes an obligation on party leaders in cabinet to deliver the legis- lative support of their parties for cabinet decisions, leaving for later work the interesting strategic matter of when party leaders going into government together might agree to a free vote on some issue. We are now in a position to explore the sequence of decisions that begins when a party leader-the leader of Party P-must take action to ensure the compliance of his or her party with some element of a decision made jointly with a coalition partner-Party Q. The most interesting case, of course, is when, other things being equal, both the leader and rank-and-file elements of Party P would prefer not to com- ply with the decision at issue. In other words, we are most interested in the case in which a party leader is being asked to deliver on some concession made during cabinet decision making. This means that, if the party leader could get away with failing to deliver, then he or she would do so, and some positive payoff would result. (Call this the "defection" payoff, p, for the leader of Party P, and call it p' for some legislator in Party P.) Since the issue concerned does not involve a free vote, the doctrine of collective cabinet responsibility obliges the party leader to whip the party in order to ensure compliance. Assume that, if Leader P does not apply the whip, then the vote will be lost. If the vote is lost, then both the leader and the legislators in Party P receive the defection payoff from not delivering on a promise to coalition partners, while the party leader suffers a loss of credibility in potentially valuable future negotiations. (Call this reputational hit c3) The promise made by Leader P is valuable to Leader Q, who faces a cost if the promise is not honoured. (Call this cost -q.) Leader Q must now decide how to react to this reneging by Leader P. Assume that the options for Leader Q are either accepting the reneging or withdrawing from the government and bringing it down. If Leader Q accepts reneging from a coalition partner, then he or she must also suffer a loss of credibility in future negotiations, being seen 14</page><page sequence="11">Divided Party, Divided Government as someone who does not punish people who fail to honour their deals. (Call this reputational hit k3.) If Leader Q does leave and bring down the government, then this is a bad outcome for all concerned. (The payoff for this has been fixed arbitrarily at -1 for each player, in contrast to the payoff of zero that arises from the outcome envisaged in the coalition agreement, whereby the whip is applied and obeyed, the vote is carried and the government stays in office.) This sequence of events is described in the bottom branch of the game tree in Figure 1, which also shows the payoffs for the three key actors: the leader of Party P, a pivotal Party P legislator, and the leader of Party Q. If the leader of Party P does not whip the party, then the leader of Party Q must decide either to stay in the government or to go. If the leader of Party Q stays, then the leader of Party P gets the payoff, p, from reneging on the agreement, but suffers a credibility hit, c3, arising from a naked refusal to apply the whip when it was clearly understood that this should be done. The legislator from Party P gets the defection payoff, p'. The leader of Party Q suffers the loss from being reneged on, -q, and the credibility hit, k3 from not punishing this, particularly when the reneging has happened in such a naked way. If, on the other hand, the leader of Party Q brings down the government, then the matter at issue remains unresolved and all involved pay the price of the fallen government. The alternative course of action for Leader P is to apply the whip. This involves instructing party legislators to vote in a particular way and imposing a sanction on each that fails to do so. Call this sanction s. For the sake of simplicity, we concentrate here upon a pivotal party legislator or faction of legislators, whose vote makes the difference between success and failure for the vote in question. Having been whipped to vote in a particular way, the legislator(s) concerned must decide whether to obey the whip or not. If they obey the whip, the vote is won. If they defy it, the vote is lost. This takes us to the intraparty game that can be found inside the box in Figure 1. If the whip is obeyed, then the vote is carried and the promise is delivered upon by Party P, provided that Leader Q does not behave in a very peculiar way, bringing down the government despite the fact that his or her coalition partner had delivered on its promises to the letter (and thus taking a big reputational hit, k,, in the process). If the whip is defied and the vote is lost, then both party leader and party legislator reap gains (of p and p' respectively) from not having to deliver on the promise to the coalition partner. Legislators face the threatened sanction, s, from the party leader, while the party 15</page><page sequence="12">Michael Laver FIGURE 1 The Whipping Game ( o,o,0) (-1, -1,-1 -k1 ) .(p-c1, p'-s,-q) (-1- c1, -1 -s, -1 ) ( p- 2, p, -q- k2 ) '(-1- 2, -1,-1 ) (p-c3, p',-q-k3) (-1, -1,-1 ) Leader P Pivotal - Leader P -+ Leader Q Legislator P' Key: p = payoff to Leader P from reneging on deal with Leader Q q = cost to Leader Q of Leader P reneging p' = defection payoff to pivotal Legislator P s = sanction applied by Leader P to pivotal Legislator P if latter defects ci = cost to Leader P of applying sanction to pivotal Legislator P ki = credibility hit to Leader Q from leaving cabinet even after Leader P applies whip c2 = credibility hit to Leader P from refusing to sanction those who defy whip k2 = credibility hit to Leader Q from accepting Leader P's refusal to sanction those who defy whip C3 = credibility hit to Leader P from refusing to apply whip at all k3 = credibility hit to Leader Q from accepting Leader P's refusal to apply whip 16</page><page sequence="13">Divided Party, Divided Government leader must decide whether actually to impose the sanction. Applying the sanction has a cost, c,, for Leader P-we may take cl to impound both the cost of imposing the sanction and the reputational hit for the party leader in imposing a whip that is defied. If Leader P decides to ignore, and not to punish, those who defy the party whip, then this course of action has its own costs c2. We can take c2 to impound both the intraparty reputational hit of threatening a sanction and then not imposing it, and the interparty reputational hit of being under an obligation to impose sanctions on internal party dissidents and then not doing so. If the whip is defied and the vote is lost, then Leader Q must decide how to respond, though the precise response may depend upon whether or not Leader P punishes the internal party dissidents whose actions defeated the vote. Once more, assume Leader Q can either accept the indiscipline within Party P that led to the failure to deliver on coalition obligations, and stay in the government, or can bring the government down. Assume that, if Leader Q accepts the dissidence in Party P, then this involves no reputational hit if those dissidents are punished as per the implicit deal. Assume however that the leader of Party Q will take a reputational hit (of k2) for staying in government if Leader P does not punish the dissidents who prevented Party P from meeting its coalition obligations. Before moving on to explore the implications of the game set out in Figure 1, we need to make a couple of simple assumptions involving the relative size of the various reputational hits we have been talking about. First, considering the potential reputational damage faced by Leader P, we assume that the biggest reputational hit for Leader P is not even to pretend to apply the whip when facing an obligation to do so. Next comes applying the whip but failing to punish dissidents. The smallest reputational hit arises from applying the whip, facing some dissidence, but punishing this. (In other words, c3 &gt; c2 &gt; c,.) Considering the potential reputational hits faced by Leader Q, all we need to assume is that he or she takes a bigger reputational hit from accepting Leader P's refusal to apply the whip when obliged to do so than from accepting Leader P's applying the whip and then failing to punish dissidents. (In other words, assume that k3 &gt; k2.) The Whipping Game The confrontations between legislature and executive explored below all turn upon defiance of the party whip by party legislators. This defiance arises because the costs of defying the whip, in terms of 17</page><page sequence="14">Michael Laver sanctions applied by the party leadership, are less than the defection payoffs arising from doing so. This in effect allows parties to renege on commitments to coalition partners and possibly to get away with this. For any given promise made to a coalition partner, the key strategic variable is the scale of the sanction applied by the party leader to those who defy the whip. This creates a situation in which party leaders may have an incentive to "shirk" by applying sanctions too small to bring about the level of compliance with the whip that is required if they are to honour their commitments to other party leaders. Thus, they may appear to be honouring their commitments, applying the whip and punishing defectors, but may be doing this in the knowledge that their whipping activities will be ineffective. The net result of this ineffective whipping will be positive for both leaders and their parties. We can divide the whipping game into four broad cases, depending on the relative size of the reputational hits suffered by Leader Q and the cost to Leader Q of Party P failing to honour its coalition promises and explore these by backward induction. Case 1. q &gt; 1 In this case Leader Q would rather bring down the government than pay the price of Leader P reneging-Leader P's promise is very valuable indeed to Leader Q. If q &gt; 1, then q + k2 &gt; 1 (and thus - q - k2 &lt; -1) q + k3 &gt; 1 (and thus - q - k3 &lt;-1) This implies that, in the final stage of the game, Leader Q will always bring down the government unless Leader P applies the whip and Party P legislators obey it. This in turn implies that Leader P will always punish defiance of the whip in the previous stage of the game, since -1 - c, &gt; -1 - c2 This further implies that the pivotal legislator will obey the whip in the stage before this, since 0 &gt; -1 - s. This in turn implies that Leader P will apply the whip in the first stage, since 0 &gt; -1. Thus, if Leader Q values Leader P's promise very highly, as assumed in this case, then the equilibrium path through the game will be WHIP-OBEY-STAY, as anticipated in the coalition agreement. Case 2. (i) q &lt; 1 and (ii) q + k2 &gt; I Condition (i) implies that, forgetting about reputational effects, Leader Q would prefer to see the government remain in place and accept not getting the promised concession from Leader P. Leader P's promise 18</page><page sequence="15">Divided Party, Divided Government is less valuable to Q than in Case 1. However, taking reputational hits into account, Leader Q would rather bring down the government than accept both Party P's failure to deliver and the reputational hit arising from accepting Leader P's failure to punish dissidents. This implies, in the final stage, that Leader Q stays in government as long as Leader P punishes party dissidents. As before, this implies that Leader P will punish dissidents this time, since p - cl &gt; -1 - c2. There are now two subcases, depending upon whether or not p' - s &lt; O, in other words, upon whether or not the sanction for defecting is greater than the defection payoff for Legislator P'. Case 2.1: p'- s &lt; O. In this case, the net payoff to Legislator P' from defying the whip is negative, since the sanction is greater than the defection payoff. Legislator P' thus obeys the whip. This implies that Leader P imposes the whip in the first stage and the equilibrium path through the game is once more WHIP-OBEY-STAY. Case 2.2. p'- s &lt; 0. In this case, the sanction is less than the defection payoff and Legislator P' defies the whip. Leader P's choice in the first stage of the game depends upon whether or not p - c &gt; -1. It seems extremely unlikely that p - c, &lt; -1, since this implies a mas- sive cl reputational hit, which arises for the relatively minor transgres- sion of applying the whip, not being obeyed, and punishing defec- tors-a hit greater than the combined value of the government not falling AND the defection payoff. So we assume p - c, &gt; -1. In this event Leader P will apply the whip in the first stage of the game, and the resulting equilibrium path is WHIP-DEFY-PUNISH-STAY. This is the first case in which Leader P does not deliver on his or her promise to Leader Q. We note that Leader Q stays in the coalition because Leader P punishes dissidents. We also note that the sanction applied to dissidents is not sufficient to deter their defiance of the whip. Strikingly, provided the c, reputational hit is not too large for Leader P (i.e., p &gt; c,), both the leader and the pivotal legislators of Party P are better off in this situation than they are in delivering upon their promises to Leader Q. In effect, Leader P applies the whip and slaps dissidents gently on the wrist for defying it and all in Party P are better off as a result. In the context of the main theme of this paper, this is the first clear case of conflict between legislature and executive. What we find is a section of the government's ostensible legislative majority defecting to defeat it, as a result of what is a quite rational and strategic, and possibly even stage-managed, breakdown in party discipline. 19</page><page sequence="16">Michael Laver Case 3. (i) q &lt; I and (ii) q + k2&lt; I and (iii) q + k3 &gt; In this case, Leader Q prefers to accept the failure to deliver on the promise and is also prepared to take a k2 reputational hit rather than bring down the government, provided that Leader P whips Party P. Leader Q is not prepared to take the k3 reputational hit arising from accepting Leader P's blatant refusal to whip at all, however. In other words, Leader P's promise is less valuable to Leader Q, all things being equal, than in cases 1 and 2. In the final stage of the game, Leader Q stays in government provided Leader P applies the whip, regardless of whether or not dissidents are punished, and leaves only if Leader P refuses to apply the whip. This implies that Leader P pun- ishes dissidents in the penultimate stage, since p - c, &gt; p - c2. There are then two subcases, exactly as in Cases 2.1 and 2.2, with an identical analysis.2 Thus Case 3. 1. p '- s &lt; 0. This implies that Leader P imposes the whip in the first stage, and the equilibrium path through the game is WHIP- OBEY-STAY. Case 3.2. p' - s &lt; 0. This implies Leader P will apply the whip in the first stage of the game, and the resulting equilibrium path is WHIP-DEFY-PUNISH-STAY. We thus have another case of conflict between legislature and executive in which party leaders in the government, despite applying the whip to parties controlling a legislative majority, are defeated in the legislature on a key coalition proposal. Case 4: (i) q &lt; 1 and (ii) q + k &lt; 1 and (iii) q + k &lt; In this case, Leader Q never brings down the government in the final stage, regardless of what Leader P does, staying in government even if Leader P refuses to apply the whip. In effect, of the various possibilities we have analysed, Leader P's promise is least valuable to Leader Q in this case, holding constant the cost of the various reputational hits. Leader P punishes defiance of the whip in the penultimate stage (p - c, &gt; p - c ). There are then two subcases, depending upon whether or not p' - s &lt; 0. Case 4. 1: p' - s &lt; 0. Once more, because the sanction for defying the whip is greater than the payoff, pivotal legislators will obey the whip at the second stage. However, Leader Q's almost total unwillingness to break the government in this case presents Leader P 20</page><page sequence="17">Divided Party, Divided Government with other strategic options. We have just seen that, if the whip is applied, then it will be obeyed and the agreed coalition deal will be delivered. However, it may be that Leader P can do better simply not applying the whip, breaking the deal, and gaining a defection payoff, offset against the price of a reputational hit. This will be the case if p - c3 &gt; 0. In this event the equilibrium path through the game will be a naked reneging by Leader P: DON'T WHIP-STAY. This case results in a legislative defeat for a majority govern- ment, but is less a case of conflict between legislature and executive, however, than of straightforward reneging by one party leader on obligations due to the other. Indeed, in this scenario, Leader P short- circuits compliance with the deal by refusing to apply the whip in the first place. If the cost of the reputational hit for such blatant perfidiousness is greater than the defection payoff, however (p - c3 &lt; 0), then Leader P will apply the whip, and the equilibrium path will be the WHIP- OBEY-STAY implied in the coalition deal. Case 4.2: p' - s &lt; 0. In this case, as before, the anticipated sanction is insufficient to prevent the pivotal legislator from defying the whip. This changes Leader P's calculations on applying the whip in the first place. Knowing it will be defied, Leader P does apply the whip, even in the knowledge that Leader Q would stay in office if it were not applied. There is no need for the blatant defection of refusing to apply the whip since Leader P knows that, because the whip will be defied if applied, the promise will not be honoured anyway. The reputational hit for applying the whip unsuccessfully and punishing defectors is less than naked refusal to apply it in the first place (i.e., p - c1 &gt; p - c3). In this event, the equilibrium path through the game is WHIP-DEFY-PUNISH-STAY. As we have seen, this generates a form of conflict between legis- lature and executive in which party leaders in government are defeated in the legislature, despite leading parties commanding a legislative majority, as a result of a breakdown in party discipline. Sanctions for Defying the Party Whip The interactions explored above place the sanctions with which potential party dissidents are threatened under intense scrutiny. Parties can renege on their coalition commitments by applying sanctions that are too small to have the required effect. The types of punishments that can be meted out by party leaders make these very hard to monitor 21</page><page sequence="18">Michael Laver at the level of detail required, however. The meagre penalties that can be applied derive from the party political game itself, and typically involve banishing dissidents from some or all of the benefits of party membership. This might involve expulsion from the party, temporary suspension, demotion on a PR list, and so on. The difficulty is that those who are banished can be unbanished quite easily, those who are demoted can be promoted again, and the possibility of thus reversing sanctions is one way in which party leaders can pull their punches in a manner that can be difficult to track. A legislator may be demoted on a party list for example, only to be re- instated once the government involved has fallen anyway, an election is due to be held, and any reaction to the reinstatement by a cheated coalition partner is no longer effective. A banished dissident whose action had defeated a government proposal may be let back into his or her party somewhat earlier than anticipated. Even if the coalition con- cerned is still in power, the strategic question that arises is whether readmitting a dissident in this way is sufficient grounds for the thwarted coalition partner now to bring down the government. Yet who is to say, looking at matters such as this from outside the party, that a nudge and a wink were not exchanged between punisher and punished at the time when mutually beneficial party indiscipline was being mooted? Given the very nature of the sanctions involved in enforcing party discipline, therefore, shirking by party leaders is going to be difficult indeed to monitor. Party Indiscipline and Conflict between Legislature and Executive The simple legislative game discussed above shows a number of cases in which conflict between legislature and executive can arise in a European-style "unified" government system, even when the incum- bent government has an ostensible legislative majority. In every one of the cases discussed, whether or not a leader delivers a unified party to honour a particular coalition commitment is an intensely strategic matter rather than something that can be taken as given. One case arises when a party leader simply refuses to whip his or her party when under an obligation to do so-openly reneging on the obliga- tions imposed by collective cabinet responsibility. A more subtle set of cases arises when legislators in government parties behave in an undisciplined manner. This indiscipline arises as a result of the interaction of two things. The first is the value attached by a party to having a coalition partner 22</page><page sequence="19">Divided Party, Divided Government honour a commitment. If a party feels strongly about the commitment concerned, or manages to convey the impression to others that it cares strongly, then there will be no incentive for reneging. Fear of provoking a coalition partner into bringing down the government will be sufficient to ensure internal party discipline. The possibility of government defeats arises once a party values the survival of the government more than the issue at stake and is prepared to accept the application of the whip and the punishment of those who defy it as a sign of the good faith of coalition partners. This opens up the possibility-as in Cases 2.2, 3.2, and 4.2 above-that the party leader says one thing, committing the party to a course of action and applying the whip in this direction, while sections of his or her party do something else. The net result is that a government that appears to command a generalised legislative majority may in practice face majority opposition in the legislature on the issue in question. This type of conflict between legislature and executive arises out of divisions (at least of role if not of opinion) within a government party-the unitary status of which is traditionally held to be one of the keys to European-style parliamentary government. We can find such intraparty divisions in practice, furthermore, not just in simplified theo- retical models, as the following example shows. Conflict between Legislature and Executive in the Netherlands In order to get a feel for the way in which intraparty politics can generate this type of conflict between legislature and executive, this section provides a brief sketch of an intriguing event in recent Dutch politics.3 This concerns a long-running policy problem offering two possible solutions. A cabinet with a secure legislative majority decided on one option, though this was opposed by one of the government parties. Legislators from the dissenting government party combined with those from the opposition to vote against the government and defeat its proposals in the legislature. As a result of the behaviour of legislators from one of the government parties, the legislature defeated this government proposal and substituted the alternative. The govern- ment accepted this outcome. The government that took office after the 1994 general election in the Netherlands was a "purple" coalition of the Labour Party, Democrats '66 (D66), and the Liberal Party. Table 1 shows the distribution of seats in the 150-seat legislature between key parties after the election and estimates of party policy positions on three key 23</page><page sequence="20">Michael Laver TABLE 1 Seats Won by, and Policy Positions of Larger Dutch Parties after the 1994 General Election Party Seats Taxation vs. Spending Immigration Environment Labour 37 8.48 7.07 9.07 Christian Democrats 34 12.70 10.46 12.81 Liberals 31 17.31 15.00 15.96 D66 24 10.56 7.04 7.44 Sources: Policy positions: Laver (1995); Seats: Lucardie and Voerman (1995). Note: All party positions are the mean judgments of the experts surveyed on the dimensions in question, on a 1-20 scale. Dimension definitions: Taxation vs. spending: Promote raising taxes to increase public services (1) versus Promote cutting public services to cut taxes (20) Immigration: Accept immigration and promote policies helping immigrants (1) versus Oppose immigration and oppose any policies helping immigrants (20) Environment: Promote environmental protection, even if this slows economic growth (1) versus Promote economic growth, even if this damages environment (20) policy dimensions, derived from an expert survey conducted at the time. These dimensions are as follows: all-important economic policy; immigration policy, the most important and divisive non-economic dimension; and the environmental policy at issue in this case (Laver 1995). The purple coalition took 111 days to form and, as can be seen from Table 1, combined two parties whose policy positions on key dimensions were quite similar, Labour and D66, with a third party, the Liberals, who had radically different positions on each key dimension. Labour and the Liberals took five cabinet portfolios each, while D66 took four. The Prime Minister was Wim Kok of Labour. The Christian Democrats, who had been in power continuously since 1917, were excluded from office despite their central position in the Dutch policy space, a position that would have made them members of the equilibrium governments predicted by almost any extant theo- retical model of government formation (Laver 1995). This deviation from equilibrium can be put down in part to personal animosities between leaders of Labour and the Christian Democrats, who had been in office together in the previous coalition, as well as a growing feeling among all of the other Dutch parties that the Christian Democrats had 24</page><page sequence="21">Divided Party, Divided Government been in government far too long, so that the benefits of getting them out came to be seen as exceeding any policy costs. The issue at stake was the location of a major new motorway, the A73, planned to run through the southern province of Limburg. Cabinets and parliaments had been discussing this issue for 30 years- the two main alternative routes were championed by those in favour of industrial development, on the one hand, and those in favour of protecting the environment, on the other. Conveniently for our current purposes, one of these routes (D1) was on the east bank of the river Maas, while the other was on the west bank (D2). Industrial interests and regional politicians favoured the eastern alternative, since this would be shorter and lead through major population centres. Environ- mental movements wanted the road on the western bank of the Maas, since fewer acres of protected land would then have to be sacrificed. The main political parties were also divided on the issue. The Christian Democrats, with a stronghold in Limburg because of its large Catholic population, backed the provincial politicians and the eastern route, Dl. The Liberals, defenders of industry, were also strongly in favour of the eastern route. For Labour and D66, the environmental arguments were dominant and they supported the western route, D2. Table 1 confirms that, if this issue is seen as one defined along the environmental policy dimension, then the Christian Democrats and Liberals are aligned on the "pro-growth" side of the spectrum, with Labour and D66 aligned on the "pro-environment" side. The issue led to several heated debates within the cabinet. Three cabinet portfolios were involved-Transport and Public Works (held by the Liberals), Housing, Planning and Environmental Management (held by Labour) and Agriculture, Nature Management and Fisheries (Liberals). After several postponements, the decision of the cabinet represented a numerical victory for Labour and D66 ministers. The cabinet decision thus favoured the environmentally friendly western route, D2. Once a cabinet decision has been taken, under the rules of the parliamentary government system, all ministers are expected to defend it. It was thus the task of the Liberals' Annemarie Jorritsma-Lebbink, the minister of Transport and Public Works, to present the cabinet decision in parliament and justify the choice of the western route that her party had in fact opposed. Her parliamentary speeches on this matter were lacking in conviction, by all accounts-she even Admitted in these to being unhappy with the cabinet decision she was now responsible for implementing, since this had not been her first choice. The other main political parties stuck to their stated positions-the Christian Democrats favouring the eastern route, Labour and D66 favouring the 25</page><page sequence="22">Michael Laver western route. The smaller left-wing parties supported the cabinet, as did one conservative orthodox-Christian party. The minister did not succeed in convincing the other smaller, conservative parties. At the end of the debate, Liberal and Christian Democrat legislators put down a motion proposing the eastern alternative. After a lot of head counting and several unsuccessful attempts to locate a nonpaired absent Labour member of parliament, the motion proposing the eastern alternative was carried by 71 to 70. Immediately after this, the cabinet announced that it would abide by the wishes of parliament and build the road on the eastern bank of the Maas. The cabinet and the legislature had come into conflict and, in this case, the legislature had won. The cabinet gave in to the parliamentary majority and neither the responsible minister, nor the whole cabinet, resigned and left office. No sanction was applied by the Liberal leadership against Liberal legislators who had voted against the decision of a cabinet of which the Liberals were members. In terms of the model set out in Figure 1, this case fits either in the category "DON'T WHIP-STAY" or "WHIP-DEFY-IGNORE-STAY," depending upon how we interpret the evidently half-hearted attempts of the Liberal minister to convince deputies from her own party to support the cabinet decision. Either way, the outcome is explicabie only if the issue at stake was of very little importance to the govern- ment parties who were reneged upon by the Liberals (q was very small), and if these parties did not set great store by their credibility in forcing cabinet colleagues to abide by collective cabinet decisions (k3 was very small too). Knowing that Labour and D66 politicians would rather shoulder all of these costs than bring down the government, Liberal legislators could then act with impunity. Despite losing the argument in cabinet, the Liberals were in this way able to end-run their cabinet colleagues and get what they wanted in the legislature. The Dutch situation is somewhat complicated by questions as to who is the "real" party leader in Holland. Is this the leader of the parliamentary party, or the leader of the Liberal ministers in cabinet? It might well be argued by experts on Dutch politics that the "real" Liberal Party was the parliamentary party, that the "real" party position was that the road should be built on the eastern bank of the Maas, that Liberal ministers simply failed to carry the day as no more than agents of the party in cabinet, and that the cabinet should have expected to have been defeated in the legislature. But such an argument would not gainsay the point that collective responsibility-one of the fundamental sources of stability for cabinet government in parliamentary democracy-was not operating in this case. 26</page><page sequence="23">Divided Party, Divided Government Conclusions A single case can do no more, of course, than put a little flesh on the bare bones of a general argument. Set in the context of the model developed above, however, this Dutch case does paint one possible picture of how conflict between legislature and executive can arise in a European parliamentary democracy. If the pattern described in the previous section were to become an established norm, then cabinet government as Europeans now know it would evolve into something quite different from what is seen as the classical system of unified government. The result would be a shift towards something more closely akin to the type of legislative- executive relations to be found in the U.S. Any cabinet decision would be liable to be overturned by a legislative coalition between the parlia- mentary opposition and losing factions in the cabinet. In short, the current European system of cabinet government depends upon tight party discipline and is liable to change quite radically if party discipline begins to break down. This concentrates our attention upon the factors that facilitate indiscipline in parliamentary parties and thereby open up the possibility of conflict between legislative and executive sections of the same party. One important factor arises when, as we have just seen in the Dutch case described above, there are different leaders of the party as a whole and the parliamentary party. In such cases, senior party politicians may go into government, but the leader of the parliamentary party may stay outside, with the potential to promote the interests of backbench party politicians when these conflict with those of the government. This is of course less a form of indiscipline than a way of running the party that keeps legislative and executive elements quite distinct. What is important in the present context, however, is that the internal affairs of a party in government are subject to conflict between executive and legislature. One obvious and well-known source of indiscipline has to do with the electoral system. Some systems, for example first-past-the- post, attach great value to membership of one of the very few large parties that are not massively underrepresented by the method of turn- ing votes into seats. In this environment, it may be much easier for leaders to punish dissidents by banishing them from the party. In highly proportional list-PR systems, in contrast, dissidents may well have much more realistic opportunities to form a credible new party, and for this reason be harder to discipline. To set against this, electoral systems in which people cast votes for individual candidates, such as 27</page><page sequence="24">Michael Laver first-past-the-post, single transferable vote, and preferential list-PR systems, allow individual legislators to build their own power bases and thereby insulate themselves from the potential sanctions of party leaders. Non-preferential list-PR systems, in contrast, make it easier for party leaders to promote or demote party legislators on the list, according to how well-behaved they have been. In short, there are complex interactions between the electoral system and the intraparty whipping game, but electoral systems do have a considerable bearing upon how easy it is for party leaders to deliver upon their promises to others. The internal governance structures of political parties also have a major impact upon the extent to which party leaders can impose their will upon the rank and file. Important matters in this regard include the way in which the party leader is chosen, the way in which party candidates for legislative office are selected, the role of the party conference and/or executive in setting party policy and mandating decisions on government formation, and so on. Some parties may well have an internal governance structure that makes them inherently more difficult to discipline. This will obviously have a bearing upon how they are viewed by others as potential partners in the making and breaking of governments. There are plenty of complex interactions to explore here but the important thing to bear in mind is the extent to which a party leader can ensure the compliance of internal elements ofthe party when it comes to delivering upon promises made to others. Parties are clearly not unitary actors, and function as unified actors only to the extent that their leaders are able to maintain disciplined behaviour among the rank and file. The less able leaders are to maintain such discipline, the greater the potential in Europe for the same type of conflict between legislature and executive that can arise under the U.S. system of divided government. The main way out of this would be a reassertion by cabinet parties of a practical strategic interpretation of the doctrine of collective cabinet responsibility to mean that all parties in a cabinet agree to abide by, and do their best to implement, cabinet decisions, even when they disagree with them. This would be backed up by the matching obligation that, when this compliance does not happen, cabinet parties who are reneged upon should withdraw from cabinet and bring down the govern- ment, however much they might wish in the short term not to have to do this. The reputational costs of failure to enforce the implicit bargain at the heart of the parliamentary government system would otherwise only lead to further reneging, further potential for conflict between legislature and executive, and a drift towards the type of legislative gridlock that can be facilitated by divided government, U.S.-style. 28</page><page sequence="25">Divided Party, Divided Government Michael Laver is Professor of Political Science and Director of the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland. NOTES An earlier version of this paper was presented at the Comparative Legislative Research Conference held at The University of Iowa, 17-18 April 1998. I am very grateful to Gerhard Loewenberg and David Mayhew for their constructive comments on an earlier version. 1. Implicit support may arise, for example, from the strategic abstention of certain actors in circumstances where voting against a proposed government would result in its defeat. It may also arise when there is no formal investiture requirement, but when the incoming government can only in practice take office if it can expect to win any early vote of no confidence it might have to face. 2. The cases have the same outcome because the change in conditions between Case 2 and Case 3 in effect change only the relative attractiveness of options for Leader Q that are off the equilibrium path. 3. I am indebted to Monique Leijenaar for providing the details of this case. REFERENCES Cox, Gary. 1987. The Efficient Secret. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Laver, Michael. 1995.
