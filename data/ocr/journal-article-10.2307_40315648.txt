Rogachev 101 Abbreviations 105 Bibliography 105 Map: Palaeolithic Sites with Specimens of Art 116 Plates 117 PREFACE This monograph is the first attempt to give a summary description and analysis of the specimens of Palaeolithic art that have been discovered within the borders of the U.S.S.R. Such discoveries have always aroused great interest, and, thanks to more or less timely publication in periodicals and less frequently in monographs devoted to individual Pa- laeolithic settlements, these discoveries have be- come widely known. However, in spite of the ex- ceptional value of the works of Palaeolithic art found in the U.S.S.R., information about them has not been summarized up to this time nor have corpora or monographs been published comparable, for ex- ample, to the works on West European Palaeolithic art by such authors as Reinach, de Saint-Perier, Kühn, Graziosi, and others. Thus it was obvious that there was a need to gather together the informa- tion scattered through various publications dealing with the subject of Palaeolithic art and, at the same time, to record as comprehensively as possible all of the unpublished material with detailed descrip- tions and classifications. While carrying out this main objective the author strove at the same time to utilize those works of Palaeolithic art in such a way that they would shed some light on primitive man's life and culture. This work is arranged in conformity with these aims. Following a brief in- troductory chapter dealing with the history of re- search on Palaeolithic art in the U.S.S.R., a detailed description is given of all recorded examples ar- ranged according to the geographical distribution of the sites where they were found: The major river basins of Eastern Europe, individual sites in the Ukraine, Crimea, and Caucasus, followed by the basins of East Siberian rivers and sites in the Altai and Ural mountains. The concluding section gives classifications of the specimens of Palaeolithic art as well as analysis of their ideological content. Published sources pertinent to the subject were utilized in this work, and analogies were drawn from the Palaeolithic art of Western and Central Europe. Along with the published material, unpublished specimens discovered up to 1959 were also incor- porated with the permission of the investigators. The section devoted to art objects from the set- tlement of Sungir1 was written by O. N. Bader. The appendix entitled "Schematic Animal Carvings from Kostenki (Anosovka II)11 was written by A. N. Roga- chev. The author considers it her duty to express pro- found gratitude to those persons without whose con- tinuous collaboration and assistance this monograph would not have been possible. Valuable counsel and the loan of material have made me indebted to P. P. Efimenko, A. P. Okladnikov, A. N. Rogachev, P. I. Boriskovskii, M. M. Gerasimov, O. N. Bader, and M. D. Gvozdover. Considerate assistance while studying the materials that are stored in the State Hermitage, the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnog- raphy, and the State Historical Museum was rendered by M. Z. Panichkina, V. V. Fedorov, and V. M. Raush- enbakh. The materials so graciously loaned by N. Z. Berdzenishvili and D. M. Tushabramishvili have considerably enriched our presentation on Palaeo- lithic art in the Caucasus. The author is also deeply grateful to the artists E. S. Matveev, T. E. Trosh- kinaia, I. M. Pavliuchenko, and to the staff of the photo laboratory at the Leningrad Division of the Institute of Archaeology, M. G. Agaronian, M. V. Kazankovaia, and M. G. Posokhovaia. HISTORY OF RESEARCH Works of Palaeolithic art - examples of the most ancient artistic creativity - have been known to science for nearly a century dating from the six- ties of the 19th century. The discoveries in Western Europe since that time of engravings and painted murals on rock, often forming a genuine "picture gallery" within a cave, in addition to numerous ex- amples of the so-called "mobile art" (Vart mobilier)-</page><page sequence="3">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 3 sculptures, bas-reliefs, engravings on stones and pieces of bone and antler - have been described in a series of monographs and research papers as well as in generalizing and popular science works. At the end of the last century lively discussions were already being carried in scientific periodicals con- cerning general problems about Palaeolithic art; foremost among them were those questions which probed the essential nature of this art and the origin of its primitive realism, while other discussions centered around the question of the role that hunting magic and fertility cults played in this art. Almost ninety years have passed since the first specimens of Palaeolithic art were discovered in this country, specifically in Siberia. Since that time, and especially in the Soviet period, remarkable art objects of Palaeolithic man have been recovered due to widely expanded research and improved meth- ods for the excavation of sites. These finds have become widely known. We are presenting these discoveries in chrono- logical order, albeit only in a summarized form, re- ferring the reader for any needed information about the Palaeolithic sites to N. A. Beregovaia's reference book, Palaeolithic Sites in the U.S.S.R. (I960). The first finds assignable to the Upper Palaeo- lithic in the U.S.S.R. were made accidently in 1871 during the construction of a military hospital in Irkutsk. In a layer of loess-like loam at a depth of 2.1 m. from the surface, along with the bones of Quaternary fauna and other finds, the following carved objects were recovered: rings, a disk, and cylindrical pieces of mammoth ivory polished and decorated with rows of parallel engraved lines (Cherskii 1872). It is unfortunate that these first specimens of artistic creation have been lost. They were destroyed in the ñre of 1879 which demolished the Geographical Society's Museum in Irkutsk. The first works of Palaeolithic art in European Russia were discovered in the nineties of the last century during V. V. Khvoiko's excavations in the famous Kirillovskaia site in Kiev. Here were found three fragments of mammoth tusk with deliberately arranged cuts in the form of short parallel lines and a section of the pointed end of a tusk with a com- plicated decorative design over the surface (Khvoiko 1901; Volkov 1899). In 1909 a large accumulation of mammoth tusks and reindeer antlers was discovered by Efimenko, who was continuing the excavations at the equally well known Mezin site, located on the right bank of the Desna River below Novgorod-Severskii. At the bottom of this accumulation very interesting ob- jects were found including sculptured representations carved from mammoth tusk and covered with an intri- cate design. In the years 1912-1913 the number of art works recovered from this site was considerably increased. There were found figures considered to represent small birds and a bracelet of mammoth ivory with an intricately meandered design (Mizin 1931). Upon renewal of work on this site in 1954- 56, I. G. Pidoplichko and I. G. Shovkoplias discovered new and unique works of art. Of special interest were three large mammoth bones, a scapula and two lower jaws on which were traces of red paint (Shovkoplias 1957a). At the beginning of the 20th century the first at- tempt was made in Russia to produce a generalizing work on Palaeolithic art. In 1912 I. I. Fomin's book, Art of the Palaeolithic Period in Europe, appeared. It was a corpus of the works of Palaeolithic art known up to that time. Of the Russian discoveries only the representation of fish from Mamontova Cave in Poland and the fragments of decorated ivory from the Kirillovskaia site were mentioned. The dilettan- tism of Fomin accounted for his skepticism and dis- trust of the authenticity of Palaeolithic art. This book, nevertheless, had the value of acquainting Russian readers for the first time with this new area of art. The Great October Revolution ushered in a new era in the further development of Palaeolithic studies which included the discovery of new works of art. In 1923, while excavating one of the most re- markable Upper Palaeolithic sites - Kostenki I on the Don - Efimenko discovered a realistic sculpture of a woman made of mammoth ivory. This was the first of its kind found within the U.S.S.R. (Efimenko 1926). It should also be mentioned that in 1915 S. A. Krukov- skii found here a fragment of the torso of a female figurine; this one was made of marl. It remained un- noticed, however, until 1922 at which time it was rediscovered by S. N. Zamiatnin in the collection of the Voronezh Regional Museum (Zamiatnin 1922). In 1925 the site of Suponevo on the Desna about 6 km. south of Briansk was discovered. During the excavations of 1925-29 by Efimenko, B. S. Zhukov, and V. A. Gorodtsov, sculptured bone objects and decorated artifacts were found (Shovkoplias, 1952). In 1927 M. V. Voevodskii discovered the Timonovka site which is located on the outskirts of Briansk. The excavation of this site was carried out by Gorodtsov. The ñnds included several fragments of bone and mammoth ivory with engraved drawings that were predominately geometric (Gorodtsov 193 5). The female figurines found by Zamiatnin while excavating the Gagarino site on the upper Don in 1927 and in 1929 are just as remarkable as those found at Kostenki I. However, they are carved in a slightly different stylistic manner (Zamiatnin 193 5). During the years 1931-36 Efimenko uncovered an extensive area of the upper (first) cultural level of the settlement of Kostenki I. This contained a variety of specimens of Palaeolithic art: figurines of women and animals, sculptured objects, ornaments, etc. (Efimenko 1958).</page><page sequence="4">4 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 During the years 1928-1934 Gerasimov exca- vated one of the most ancient sites in Siberia. This was the site of Mal'ta located about 80 km. west of Irkutsk. Living complexes were exposed and found to contain extraordinarily rich works of art of various genres: female figurines and figurines of birds, en- graved portrayals of snakes and a mammoth, various sculptured articles covered with designs, plus adorn- ments, and so on (Gerasimov 1935). In 1956 the work on this site was resumed and yielded new, out- standing discoveries in the field of Palaeolithic art (Gerasimov 1958). Cliff engravings comprising various rectilinear tectiforms were discovered for the first time in the U.S.S.R. by Zamiatnin in 1934 at Mgvimov (in West Georgia). He argued with great persuasiveness that these belonged to Palaeolithic times (Zamiatnin 1937). In 1935 K. M. Polikarpovich began excavations at the Eliseevichi Site which is situated on the right bank of the Sudosta River 40 km. from Briansk. Here in an accumulation of mammoth skulls was found a large female figurine and over ten big plaques made of mammoth ivory, the latter decorated on the face with an intricate design of uncertain character exe- cuted by fine line engraving (Polikarpovich 1940a, 1940b). During the years 1936-40 Okladnikov investi- gated the Buret1 Site which is located on the right bank of the Angara River not far from the mouth of the Belaia River. Inside the living complexes were found five female figurines, figurines of birds, disks, and pendants made of stone or antler (Oklad- nikov 1940). A large, intricate complex was opened up by Rogachev between the years 193 7-1938 at Kostenki IV on the Don River. In the round dwellings were found numerous small objects of marl representing mostly figurines of mammoth and possibly bison, and also various other sculptured objects and orna- ments (Rogachev 1955). In 1941 Okladnikov discovered some pictographs of animals assignable to the Palaeolithic era, some- thing hitherto unknown in the U.S.S.R., among the petroglyphs of the Shishkino "sacred place" about 18 km from Kachug on the right bank of the Lena River ( Okladnikov 1959a). The Avdeevo Site íocated 40 km from Kursk was first explored by Voevodskii in 1948, followed by Rogachev in 1949. In the central part of a dwelling complex four female figurines of mammoth ivory, the figurine of a mammoth, and various sculptured ob- jects and ornaments often covered with decorative designs were found (Gvozdover 1953). After the resumption of the exploration at Kostenki I in 1951, Rogachev found some remarkable examples of female figurines made of mammoth ivory ( Rogachev 1957). In 1953 Boriskovskii found a stylized figurine made of bone and several decorated objects in a dwelling at the Kostenki II Site on the Don (Boriskov- skii 1956a). In 1955 in the 7th horizon at the Molodova V Site on the Dnestr River, A. P. Chernysh discovered an accumulation of five "batons" made of deer antler. One of these "batons" was carved in low relief and portrayed a human face. In addition to this, sculp- tured objects and ornaments were also found (Chernysh 1956b). During the excavation of the Anosovka II Site on the Don River in 1956 Rogachev discovered in the second cultural layer numerous hemispherical ob- jects, and figurines of animals made of marl, in all probability, mammoth or rhinoceros, and bone arti- facts. A flat bone animal figure, most likely a horse, and various ornaments were discovered in 1957 by Bader at the Sungir1 Site near Vladimir. A number of isolated but no less significant specimens of Palaeolithic art from other sites in the U.S.S.R. are known, and they too will be described below. In addition to the works of a series of in- vestigators which we will mention in the course of describing the material, there are works on items of Palaeolithic art productions published in connection with settlement descriptions which, to some extent, provide interpretations of them. In addition to these works one must note general studies and articles devoted entirely or partially to general problems of artistic creation in the Palaeolithic period. Naturally we are not able to give an analysis of all the opin- ions held in our literature concerning Palaeolithic art in this short sketch, and for that reason we will refer only to the principle ones. Although Gorodtsov did not write any specific articles about Palaeolithic art, he did call special attention to it in a number of his works. To his way of thinking this art is one of the most important sources by which one can understand the life and culture - especially spiritual - of ancient mankind. He emphasized that Palaeolithic art, and in particu- lar that of Mezin, "... offers one an exciting chal- lenge, but at the same time demands a careful study of the relics, since a sound interpretation of their meaning can not only reveal the secret of our Palaeo- lithic ancestors' religious views but also the secret of their abstract understanding of the phenomena of the natural world, and of the influence of their phil- osophical 'Weltanschauung' on that of their later descendents down to the present day" (Gorodtsov 1923:284). Rogachev in his works repeatedly and correctly emphasized that Gorodtsov is the founder of a definite direction in the study of the Stone Age in Soviet science: He tried to give, on the basis of archaeological material, a concrete picture of the interrelationships of Palaeolithic cultures and ancient</page><page sequence="5">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 5 ethnic communities. Considering Palaeolithic art :rom this point of view, he was led to an important iiscovery: the establishment of three major areas Df distinctive manifestation of Magdalenian culture - the Atlantic, Danubian, and East European - the üast European having highly developed geometric decoration (Gorodtsov 1923). In 1929 a book appeared which was entitled A History of Art of All Times and Peoples . Included .n this work was an article written by A. A. Miller which was entitled "Primitive Art." He did not take up the question pertaining to Palaeolithic art which at that time was little known in the U.S.S.R., how- Bver he did discuss its general and theoretical principles. According to him primitive art themes were almost always linked with religious practice In its initial form, magic. In 1929 an article by D. V. Ainalov, "Primitive Magic in European Art," was published. A profound and thoughtful analysis of the Palaeolithic cave art of Western Europe was presented in this article. He noted that however fragmentary this art may be, the examples of it are a clear reflection of living actuality. The subjects of Palaeolithic art are a testimony to the artist's ability to solve composi- tional problems and to arrange figures symmetrically or in contrast. B. B. Piotrovskii's article "Primitive Art" has in common with the work of Ainalov that, along with West European Palaeolithic art, the author gives attention to works of art from Palaeolithic sites in the U.S.S.R. In 193 7 a book, The Origin of Art, written by A. S. Gushchin appeared. On the basis of an anal- ysis of the vast amount of material accumulated up to that time, chiefly from Upper Palaeolithic sites of the West, Gushchin poses general problems of the origin of art. In spite of a few errors, on the whole this book represents an important landmark in the development of our ideas about the art and ideology of the Palaeolithic period. This book has not lost any of its value, and at the present time it remains the only comprehensive work on Palaeo- lithic art in the Russian language. The most attention given to the problems of Palaeolithic art in Soviet archaeological literature has been on the part of Efimenko. After the dis- covery of the first female figurine at Kostenki he raised in a number of articles the question of the meaning and purpose of such figurines in the Aurig- nacian and Solutrean periods (Efimenko 1931a, 1931b, 1931c). In his generalizing work, Primitive Society , Efimenko (1953) considers many questions connected with primitive ideology. An entire section in Chap- ter V, "The Aurignacian and Solutrean Epochs," is devoted to the representational art of the inhabitants of the sedentary communities of Europe and Siberia. The female figurines are described in detail. Special consideration is given to the representations of ani- mals. The author reveals the significance of these subjects of art in Upper Palaeolithic society. In Chapter VI, "The Magdalenian Epoch," a special section is devoted to the elucidation of the pecu- liarities of Magdalenian representational art. In connection with this he also poses general problems about the significance of primitive art and the birth of aesthetic concepts. He writes. "However difficult it is to give a clear re- port as to what the artistic creations of the Late Palaeolithic period represent, never- theless, in view of the rather superficial knowledge of the primitive world view which science provides at the present time, we may all the same contend that this art at this stage of social evolution must actually have fulfilled a rather serious social func- tion. Knowing what role portrayals play in the eyes of primitive man, we are correct in seeing the cave paintings and artistically executed images of animals and people which are preserved among other remains in the many sites of the Late Palaeolithic as documents testifying to the existence of definite ceremonial rites and some kind of a cult and the concepts associated with them" (Efimenko 1953:302). The article entitled "The Origin of Local Differ- ences in the Culture of the Palaeolithic Period," by Zamiatnin exerted a great influence on the develop- ment of our views about Palaeolithic art. He points out the great role played by the production of repre- sentational arts and ornaments in elucidating local differences in the Upper Palaeolithic. In particular, he shows that the female figurines are one of the most important indicators of a community of culture of the European periglacial regions in the first half of the Upper Palaeolithic. Later on during the Mag- dalenian it is possible to establish two large prov- inces in this area - the Western and the Eastern - and then the smaller divisions of a local character. The existence of these two provinces shows up very clearly in the distinctive geometric ornamental art of Eastern Europe during the latter part of the Upper Palaeolithic (Zamiatnin 1954). Zamiatnin also advanced a hypothesis regarding the purpose of the female figurines which we will discuss in detail later. In his writings, and especially in his monograph, The Palaeolithic of the Ukraine , Boriskovskii often takes up the problems concerning Palaeolithic art. Thus the famous tusk with its decorative pattern from the Kirillovskaia Site has elicited a number of questions from him regarding the meaning and sub-</page><page sequence="6">6 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 stance of art. He points out that in order to cor- rectly understand the relics of this art one must take into account distinctive features of primitive ideological concepts. The lower level of primitive man's development did not permit him to evaluate and explain the various phenomena in a logical man- ner, and his art visibly displays the realism that he captured directly from life and which, at the same time, he interwove with his own unreal and fantastic concepts. In reference to the Mezin Site, Boriskov- skii, having analyzed the geometric design that covered some of those carved objects, notes the aesthetic significance of these schematic, conven- tionalized representations. During the post-war years Okladnikov directed his attention to the question of the origin of art. He exposed the reactionary character of the opinions held by bourgeois art historians and archaeologists on the subject of primitive art, while at the same time he examined in detail the vulgar, pseudo- Marxist views in regard to the origin of art. Okladnikov, in exposing the errors of Marr, opposed him with a Marxist statement concerning the place of art in the actual history of primitive man and his culture. Following in Chernishevskii's path, Okladnikov observed that art should not only reproduce nature and life, but "... it has another, far greater significance. . . it should explain life, and in its own special way should assist one to ex- perience it more deeply and fully" (Okladnikov 1952: 14). This article by Okladnikov drew a statement from Astakhov. His criticism of Okladnikov1 s posi- tion is obviously of a biased nature. In his doctoral dissertation, The Origin and Development of Art According to Marxist-Leninist Aesthetics (1953b) (published in abstract only), Astakhov displays his complete ignorance and dis- regard of any archaeological material and does not take heed of the magnitude and diverse complexities of Palaeolithic art, advancing his own falsifications or "hackneyed distortions of the facts in the guise of preconceived concepts." His non-dialectical approach and inability to grasp the inherent contra- dictions in his view of Palaeolithic art have been subjected to criticism on the part of Okladnikov (1954). Astakhov's superficial attitude toward the dictums of classical Marxism, his lack of knowl- edge about any factual material not only regarding primitive art but primitive society as well, and even his unscientific "method" of criticism are the sources of his erroneous opinions. The positions taken by Astakhov, however, have been continued in the writings of Agamalian (1958), who reiterates on the whole the same errors, even denying the existence of Palaeolithic art. Of the recent works on the subject of Palaeo- lithic art it is necessary that we should mention an article written by Okladnikov: "The Results and Principal Problems in the Study of the Palaeolithic in the U.S.S.R. During the Last Forty Years" (1957). He states that "The rich and varied art of the Upper Palaeolithic must have had a corresponding ideo- logical content." This art is mainly restricted to those subjects which bear a direct relationship to the hunting mode of life. "Animal images occupy first place in it, but next to these are the images of women who were in- separably linked with the social life of Palaeolithic man" (Okladnikov 1957:19). According to Okladnikov the portrayals of birds, snakes, and even intricate designs were, in all probability, connected with man's ideas about the sky, earth, and other elements of nature. In a number of other works Okladnikov dwells at length on the significance of the female image in Palaeolithic art. We shall review these opinions in an appropriate section. A great deal of attention has been given to the works of Palaeolithic art and its related problem re- garding primitive man's world outlook in the works of Rogachev. On the basis of his own new discover- ies at the Kostenki Site as well as on the works of other Soviet researchers, he arrived at an important conclusion regarding the significance of these for elucidating historico-ethnological characteristics of Upper Palaeolithic cultures. Thus, on the basis of the analysis of artifacts of marl in particular, he established in 195 7 the important fact of the chrono- logical similarity between the upper layers at Kostenki I and IV. Most of the generalized works published within recent years in the Soviet Union which pertain to the history of art, the world, or the U.S.S.R. , consider to some extent these general questions concerning Pa- laeolithic art, although naturally in brief form. The distinguished art historian, M. V. Alpatov, for instance, has included a chapter devoted to the art of the Stone Age in his monograph. It presents a general outline regarding the development of art in the Stone Age based mainly on the examples from the caves of France (Alpatov 1948). In the first volume of Universal History of the Arts (1956) there is a special chapter entitled "The Origin of Art" written by N. A. Dmitrievaia. On the whole it offers a deep theoretical analysis of the problem. The characteristics in the history of Pa- laeolithic art are presented in the second chapter, "Fundamental Stages in the Development of Primi- tive Art," written by V. V. Shleev. Both of these articles are based on the study of West European material, however, and do not give due attention to the rich collection of Palaeolithic art examples in the U.S.S.R. From among the comprehensive works on history the questions concerning Palaeolithic art are most</page><page sequence="7">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 7 fully treated in the first volume of Universal World History (1955) in which there is a chapter by Oklad- nikov on the Upper Palaeolithic Era containing a special paragraph entitled "Art and Religion." In it are given the general characteristics of the histori- cal development of the art of that era, and at the same time the discoveries of the figurines of women and animals are noted in the U.S.S.R. One of the female figurines of Kostenki I (from the 1936 excava- tions) was included alongside the pictoral reproduc- tions of the cave paintings of France. The art of the Upper Palaeolithic of the U.S.S.R. is also given consideration in Outline History of the U.S.S.R. published in 1956. Several female figurines, art objects from Mezin, and the heads of a lioness and a bear from Kostenki I are shown on two plates from a text of Boriskovskii. He also mentions the more important discoveries. In the Great Soviet Encyclopedia there is a major generalizing article by Okladnikov on primi- tive art (1955b) containing a theoretical analysis of the characteristics of Palaeolithic art and elu- cidating its place in the history of aesthetic culture. Soviet ethnographers have also concerned them- selves with the questions regarding Palaeolithic art time and again. S. V. Ivanov has done a particularily great amount of work in this field. V. G. Bogoraz, A. F. Anisimov, and others have dwelled at length on an interpretation of the meaning of the female figurines. Having considered the history of research on Palaeolithic art in the U.S.S.R. it is possible to arrive at the following conclusions: 1. Specimens of Palaeolithic art have often received very thorough and detailed treat- ment in the reports on the sites where they are found. 2. The problems of Palaeolithic art have been reviewed in a number of articles and general works in which the greatest attention has been focused on those questions pertaining to the origin of art and the interpretation of the female figurines. 3. Comprehensive works devoted to the Palaeo- lithic art of the U.S.S.R. have not been pub- lished up to this time. The present volume of the series Corpus of Archaeological Source Materials (Svod arkheologicheskikh istochnikov) is intended to fill this gap. DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIMENS OF PALAEOLITHIC ART The areal distribution of specimens of Palaeo- lithic art in the U.S.S.R. covers an enormous space: from the Dnepr in the west to Lake Baikal in the east and from the city of Vladimir in the north to the shores of the Black Sea in the south (Caucasus and Crimea). Within this extensive territory Soviet archaeologists have distinguished three major cul- tural areas of the Upper Palaeolithic. The first area, the East European, includes the river basins of the Don, Dnepr, Desna, and Dnestr, and it is here that the most important groups of Palaeolithic settlements are located. Also to be included in this same prov- ince are those isolated sites such as Sungir1 on the Kliazma River and Amvrosievka in the Donets Basin. The second area, the Northern Asiatic, includes all the Palaeolithic sites of Siberia. The third area, or Southern, includes all the sites of the Caucasus, Crimea, and Central Asia. In accordance with these three general divisions of Palaeolithic sites within the territory of the U.S.S.R., we shall now examine the specimens of art belonging to them (see map). THE EAST EUROPEAN PORTION OF THE U.S.S.R. Without doubt the center of attraction in the first area is the Kostenki-Borshevo region of the Don Basin, and there is not a more remarkable focus of ancient man's artistic endeavors than the remains which have appeared at Kostenki I. 1. Kostenki I (Upper Level)* Kostenki I is a multi-level site on the right- hand slope of the Pokrovskii Ravine in the village of Kostenki 35 km. south of Voronezh (Efimenko 1958). In the course of the 1931-36 excavations in "The ordinal number of the site on the map cor- responds with the number of the site in the text. the upper (first) levels, an oval-shaped area 35 m. long and 15-16 m. wide was cleared away from the upper (first) strata by Efimenko. This area was com- pletely filled with cultural remains. Along the center of this tract for the length of its axis there extended a row of hearths which had a diameter of approxi- mately 1 m. and were spaced about 2 m. apart. The entire area of this site was strewn with pits and holes of various shapes and dimensions which evi- dently had been used for a variety of purposes. One of them seems to have been in use as a repository for valuables: female figurines, figurines and heads of animals, sculptured articles, ornaments, and so on. Because of the overwhelming abundance of these objects and the perfection of execution of</page><page sequence="8">8 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 many of them, Kostenki I rightfully occupies the place of one of the most important sites in the U.S.S.R. and in all of Europe. PORTRAYALS OF WOMEN. Of greatest interest among the sculptures discovered at Kostenki I are the portrayals of women. They have survived both in the form of entire, perfectly executed figurines and also in fragments of them. Female Figurine No. 1 (Pis. 1:1 and 11:1, Collection IE, 4464/1). Found in 1923 in storage pit No. 12, Square D-6. Made of mammoth ivory. Height, 9 cm. Represents a nude female form almost full length. The head and lower part of the legs were broken off long ago. The figure was treated strictly frontally in a stiffened pose. The body is quite slender and well proportioned, the thighs narrow and graceful in outline, while the hips are comparatively wide. The shoulders are very narrow and the thin arms are tightly pressed to the body down to the elbows. The hands are reposing on the abdomen. These features of bodily structure are combined with huge, pear-sheaped, loose-hanging breasts and a pro- truding abdomen. The navel is formed by a natural hollow, and on the reverse side the fullness of the body is shown by deep, transverse lines represent- ing creases. Across the upper part of the bosom is a band of three finely engraved lines with oblique parallel hachures. An identical band is located at the same level on the back, but here it is somewhat obliterated. The hands are also marked with trans- verse bands. On the back, there is a braid-like strand which is more likely some kind of a belt en- circling the waist than a fat fold (Efimenko 1958: 346-348, Fig. 140, Pis. XIV-XV). Female Figurine No. 2 (Pis. 1:2 and 11:2, Coll. IE, 6051/1). Found in 1931 in a storage pit in Square N-8 together with a huge figurine made of stone (No. 5). Made of mammoth ivory. Height, 15 cm. Represents a nude female form. The head was broken off long ago by a strong blow from the back. Preservation is poor. The breasts and ab- domen have partially crumbled away, and the ends of the legs have been broken off. It is covered with the usual dark brown patina. The proportions of this figurine have an extremely stretched out look, and for that reason it has to some degree a con- ventionalized character. The torso, thorax, and sides are elongated, the shoulders are narrow, the back is strongly inclined backwards, while at the same time these features are combined with mas- sive, low placed breasts that droop down over a small but nevertheless bulging abdomen. The arms down to the elbows are tightly pressed to the body, but below this point they cannot be traced. The thighs have natural proportions, but below the knees the legs are nothing more than short appendages slightly bent under and spread apart. The buttocks are also reproduced in a somewhat conventionalized manner being flat and elongated, sharply curving in- ward at the center, and distinctly separated from the upper end of the thighs. Two rows consisting of small dentate cuts de- scend from the shoulders and come together at an angle between the breasts. Similarly, some thin engraved lines encircle the neck and finally meet in the center of the back. A row of small narrow cuts can be observed on the preserved part of the nape of the neck. On the small of the back there are a few rows of fine dentate cuts portraying in low re- lief something either braided or woven. Two or three of these are located on the small of the back proper, while another one is located a little higher up (Efimenko 1958:348-349, Fig. 141, PI. XVI). Female Figurine No. 3 (Pis. 111:1 and IV: 1, Coll. IE, 6051/2). Found in 1936 in Square D-27 at the bottom of an old storage pit evidently abandoned long ago. Made of mammoth ivory. Height, 11.4 cm. This is the only figurine from Kostenki I that has been preserved in full with the exception of some minor damage on the right breast and the adjacent part of the abdomen. It is distinguished by its com- pleteness and its perfection of execution. A well proportioned nude woman is portrayed; the upper part of the body is slender and graceful, but again there is that heavy, massive form of the breasts and ab- domen. The head has been well preserved, slightly flattened on the crown and back part, markedly in- clined forward, and sits atop a comparatively long and slender neck. The face is inclined downwards and is surrounded by a carved line like a rim. Rows of tiny dentate cuts cover the entire surface of the head from this rim to the occiput and are intended to portray either hair or a snug fitting little fur cap. The shoulders are narrow, and the thin arms are pressed to the body as though supporting the breasts from below. The flat, narrow upper portion of the torso is counteracted by the abrupt, sharply project- ing outlines of the hips and the massive breasts which hang down over a bulging abdomen. The thighs are depicted in relief, and the curve of the knees is well depicted. The lower part of the legs are ren- dered in a more realistic manner, but they are still short in comparison with the rest of the figure. The legs terminate in a tiny contraction instead of in feet. Slightly above the feet there is a small groove which separates this part of the legs. On the right side of the breast two vertical lines were begun, probably being an unfinished shoulder belt. On the back a vertical groove represents the vertebral column, and the waistline is encircled by a braid in relief achieved by light cogged cuts. Because of the slightly flexed knees and the forward inclination of the head, this figurine has an animated and nat- ural pose (Efimenko 1958:349-350, Fig. 142, PI. XVII).</page><page sequence="9">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 9 Female Figurine No. 4 (Pis. 111:2 and IV:2). Found in 1951 by Rogachev in the second complex at Kostenki I in Square G-2. Made of mammoth ivory. It has large dimensions: The height is almost 16 cm. The preservation of the ivory is poor, almost the entire surface being covered by longitudinal cracks and pits. The head was broken off long ago, and in place of the neck there is now only a wide slanting fracture. The legs are also broken. The upper part of the torso is broad and flat, while the oval, volum- inous breasts are placed close together and hang low. The thin arms, clearly separated by the shoul- der area, are concealed under the breasts and end over the abdomen. The latter is rather small and round in form; sharp lines accentuate its separation from the legs. The pelvis and thighs are very wide, but the latter taper off abruptly toward the knees. The line of the back is straight, barely curving. The buttocks bulge considerably but they are in an es- pecially bad state of preservation. On the upper part of the breasts (which are also poorly preserved) can be seen a double line dentate band which also occurs at the same level on the back. In the area of the waist there is a fillet (Rogachev 1957:26, Fig. 6). Female Figurine No. 5 (Pis. V:3 and VI, Coll. IE, 6223/1). Discovered in 1931 together with Figurine No. 2. It was found in a broken condition and the fragments were collected from both inside and out- side a pit in Square No. 8. It had apparently been intentionally smashed by a strong blow in the region of the breast where traces of the preceding weaker blows can still be seen. This figurine is made of compact clay-like chalk. Its height is 17.5 cm. This figurine is noticeably different from those made of mammoth ivory. The contours of the body are represented in a rather summary and conven- tionalized figure. The peculiarities of style can be explained as the result of the material in this case. According to Efimenko the unusual treatment is to be explained by the fact that this female figure is not entirely naked but is partially covered by some kind of clothing. Corresponding to this there is a heavy massive and faceless head and the arms and breasts are reproduced in one plane in a totally unusual manner since the lines of the breasts and abdomen were not worked out. If one takes into consideration the forward inclination of the head and the downward tilt of the face and if one con- siders the truncated cone on the top of the head as being a low cap or flat fur hood, this can explain the hachures on the front of the head. On the upper part of a completely flat chest there are etched some small and for the most part parallel cuts pos- sibly representing the long hairs on a fur cloak. These same markings can also be observed in the region of the abdomen, especially around the lower part. The arms have natural proportions and are outlined only above the elbows where they merge in one plane with the lines of the breasts and partly with the protruding abdomen. The upper part of the legs are distinguished by their extreme massiveness and are disproportionately short below the knees. The back has been interpreted more realistically. A short, massive neck rises over a backward slanting torso. The lines of the back follow smoothly the natural curve of the spine. The sacrum and buttocks have been reproduced in a flat manner evidently not having been shaped. Spots of a red tint can still be seen in places on the light colored surface of the figurine, but there is a possibility that they were not deliberately ap- plied but are simply traces of the common ferruginous pigment present in the storage pit (Efimenko 1958: 351-353, Fig. 143). Female Figurine No. 6 (Pis. V:l and VII: 1, Coll. IE, 6223/11). Found in 1936 in a molehill (krotovina) in Excavation III. Made of very compact marl of a yellowish color. Height, 4.2 cm. Preserved almost in its entirety with the exception of the lower part of the legs which have been broken off by an oblique blow. This figurine has been carefully made though not treated in an entirely usual manner. The head is slightly tilted back and the face is raised upwards. On the left side of the head the helix of the ear can be observed, while behind it a strand of hair falls onto the shoulder. Hair is also portrayed on the right shoulder by means of thin vertical hachures. The breasts stand out faintly and no cleavage is shown between them; the abdomen is enlarged and the arms clearly shown in relief are reposing on it. The flat back has received little attention except for the thighs which are well reproduced and bulging. The lower part of the legs evidently tapered off to a cone. The somewhat generalized treatment of this reproduction can evidently be explained by the presence of clothing which conceals the outlines of the body (Efimenko 1958:354-355, Fig. 144). The remaining figurines from Kostenki I are repre- sented in the form of various fragments. Fragment of Female Figurine No. 7 (Pis. V:2 and VII:2, Coll. IE, 6223/4). Found in 1936 in Squares M, N-29, 30. Material, marl. Height, 1.8 cm. This is a fragment of a graceful miniature figurine repre- senting part of the torso and thighs of a nude woman. In spite of its exceptionally small dimensions, this female form has been reproduced in a very animated and realistic manner. The upper fracture passes slightly above the waistline and the abdomen has been somewhat damaged. The legs were broken off above the knees. Although the right arm has crumbled away at the elbow, that part of it that is reposing on the abdomen can still be seen very well. Only a small piece of the left arm is intact. The chest merges inconspicuously with an excessively swollen abdomen. The buttocks are represented in the form</page><page sequence="10">10 Arctic Anthropology IV -2 of a transversely located fillet. In rear view one can easily trace the change in outline from a fairly slender waist to the wide, rounded hips - and further on to the proportional, slender thighs. The latter are separated from each other in the back by a deeply carved line (Efimenko 1958:356, Fig. 146:1). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 8 (Pis. VII: 5 and VIII: 1, Coll. IE, 6223/8). Found in 1934 in the Kel1 sieva pit in Excavation III. The material is com- mon marl, grayish in color. Height, 4.2 cm.; width, 5.6 cm. This is a fragment of a very large female figurine which represents the upper part of a female torso comprising both breasts with the adjoining portion of the back and the right arm. Traces of the blows by which the figurine was broken can easily be seen: The head and shoulders were broken off by one strong transverse blow, the lower part of the torso by another; the left side was knocked off by a longitudinal blow. The preserved portions are portrayed proportionately and realistically. The cleavage between the breasts is well defined on the upper part of the bulging torso. Long, vertical hatching, very slightly curved, is observed on the right breast. The rest of the surface is well pre- served and has been carefully smoothed. Judging by the dimensions of the fragment this figurine must have had a height of 15-16 cm. (Efimenko, 1958:306, Fig. 148). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 9 (PI. VIII-.2, Coll. 6223/9). Found in 1936 in backdirt. The ma- terial is very compact, yellowish marl. Height, 4.3 cm.; width, 4 cm. This fragment consists of the upper part of the torso of a large figurine. The head and shoulders were broken by one blow, and the other break was made at the level of the waist. The back has been damaged by chipping. The only part that is intact is the voluminous, loose-hanging breasts, the left one being slightly damaged. In the upper flat portion of the breast several short longi- tudinal hachures are visible. Along the sides it is possible to trace the arms. From the dimensions of the fragment one can estimate that the figurine, when whole, had a height of approximately ]0-12 cm. (Efimenko 1958:360, Fig. 147:3). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 10 (PI. VIII: 13, Coll. IE, 6223/10). Found in 1936 in chernozem. The material is common grayish marl. Height, 2.4 cm.; width, 2.8 cm. Represents a portion of the torso of a female figurine. Only the realistically shaped breasts are preserved although the right one is badly damaged. The back has been lopped off entirely, and the wide break runs obliquely from the base of the left breast over to the lower end of the right one. The breasts are divided by a deep groove. The surface shows signs of weathering. The origi- nal height of this figurine was apparently some- where between 8-9 cm. (Efimenko 1958:361, Fig. 150:1). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 11 (PI. VIII: 6, Coll. IE, 6223/11). Found in 1936 in Square K-28. The material is marl. Height, 2.2 cm.; width, 3 cm. Represents a portion of a female torso with massive round breasts, the right one being badly damaged on one side. The upper part of a thin arm has been pre- served by the left breast. Three large facets can be observed where a section of the back and the upper and lower parts of the figurine were broken off. The voluminous breasts are wide, a fact which testifies to the squatty proportions of this figurine. Thus the original height was probably close to 7 cm. (Efimenko 1958:361, Fig. 150:8). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 12 (Pis. VII:6 and VIII: 3, Coll. IE, 6223/12). Found in 1934 in storage pit No. IV. The material is common marl. Height, 1.7 cm.; width, 2.2 cm. Represents the upper part of a rather small but carefully made figurine. The head and shoulders have been broken off, and the other break occurred at the level of the waist. In contrast to the precisely similar Fragment No. 9, the back of this figurine is well preserved. Enormous pear-shaped breasts, clearly separated from each other, are por- trayed on the front side. The left one is slightly damaged on the lower part. The arms stand out clearly both in front and in back, but they are not completed on the ends, as though hidden under the breasts. The back is even and slightly protuberant. The surface of this fragment is smoothed and polished in some places (Efimenko 1958:361-362, Fig. 149, PI. XXII: 1, 2). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 13 (PI. VIII:9, Coll. IE, 6223/13). Found in 1933 in Square R-ll. The material is marl. Height, 2 cm.; width, 2.6 cm. Represents the upper part of the torso of a female figurine. The preservation is poor. It has been broken off on the lower part almost at the level of the waist. Because of the weathered condition of the surface it is impossible to make out the traces of the breaking off of the head. The bulging breasts are preserved almost in full although there is no division between them. Also preserved are both shoulders, and along the sides are the upper part of the arms approximately down to the elbows plus a portion of the back. In its entirety this figurine may have had a height of 7-7.5 cm. (Efimenko 1958:363, Fig. 150:2). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 14 (Pis. VIII: 8, Coll. IE, 6223/14). Found in 1931 in Square E-5. The material is marl. Height, 2.9 cm.; width, 3.6 cm. Represents the upper part of the torso of a female figurine. It is analogous to No. 13 but more crudely made, possibly because it was not completed. The prominent even but unshaped breasts can be made out as well as the sloping left shoulder and upper part of the left arm. The right shoulder is raised somewhat higher. On the latter can be seen the blow which removed the head. The break on the</page><page sequence="11">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U .S .S .R. H lower part is perfectly even traveling along at the level of the waist. The back, is also flat and has no traces of finishing. The height of this figurine may have reached 8 cm. (Efimenko 1958:363, Fig. 150:9). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 15 (PL VIII: 5, Coll. IE, 6223/23). Found in 1934 in Square 1-26. The material is very compact yellowish marl. Height, 2.3 cm. Represents part of a torso but only from the facial side; the corresponding area of the back has been lopped off. A voluminous, loose-hanging left breast is still intact and looks as though it was being supported by the little arm (Efimenko 19 58: 365, Fig. 152:1). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 16 (Coll. IE, 6225/16). Found in Square A-15. The material is compact yellowish marl. Height, 2.1 cm. Represents the breast and part of the left arm of a female fig- urine. Deeply incised hachures going in a longi- tudinal direction can be seen on the surface (Efimenko 1958:364). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 17 (PL VIII: 10, Coll. IE, 6223/17). Found in 1933 in Square Q, R- 10. The material is marl. Height, 2.8 cm. Repre- sents part of the torso of a female figurine. The left shoulder and breast and the upper part of the left arm can be made out. The break which took off the right portion of the torso passes obliquely down from the neck. Traces of polishing can be seen on those areas which are still intact (Efimenko, 1958:364, Fig. 150:4). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 18 (PL VIII: 1 1 , Coll. IE, 6223/21). Found in 1936 in Square S-15. The material is marl. Height, 2.1 cm. Represents part of the torso of a female figurine. The upper part of the chest is flat and has been polished, while that part below the left breast which has been preserved is depicted as bulging and drooping. The arm adjoins the latter from the shoulder down to the elbow, and the working of the slightly curved back does not seem to have been completely finished (Efimenko 1958:365, Fig. 150:3). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 19 (PL VIII: 12). Found in 1936 in backdirt. Height, 2.8 cm. The material is marl. Represents part of the torso of a female figurine. The right side, including part of the shoulder, can be discerned as well as the right breast, a small portion of the back, and the arm which is bent at the elbow. The surface of this fragment has been badly weathered (Efimenko 1958: 364, Fig. 150:5). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 20 (PL VIII: 14, Coll. IE, 6223/19). Found in 1932 in Square M-13. The material is marl. Height, 2.7 cm. Represents the right half of the upper part of the torso of a fe- male figurine. On the right side of the pear-shaped breast has been preserved in full. Part of the right arm, which is bent at the elbow, looks as though it is about to go under the breast. The elbow is par- tially damaged, and the surface on the back side of this fragment is in a poor state of preservation (Efimenko 1958:364, Fig. 150:6). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 21 (PL VIII: 15, Coll. 6223/18). Found in 1933 in Square P-10. The material is marl. Height, 2.7 cm. Represents part of the torso of a female figurine. The right shoulder can be made out as well as the upper part of the right arm with the adjoining portion of a smooth slightly curving back and an amorphous piece of the breast. The surface has been carefully smoothed off, but traces of long carving (stes) marks can be traced in places. Two incised lines, placed closely together, can be seen on the upper part of the arm (Efimenko 1958:364, Fig. 150:7). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 22 (Coll. IE, 6223/20). Found in 1932 in Square 1-17. The ma- terial is marl. Height, 2.6 cm. Represents part of the torso of a female figurine, preserved only on the facial side, part of the right shoulder, the upper part of the right arm, and a portion of the breast (Efimenko 1958:364). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 23 (PL VIII: 7, Coll. IE, 6223/22). Found in 1936 in Square M, N- 29, 30. The material is marl. Height, 2.4 cm. Represents part of the torso (the right side) of a fe- male figurine. The right arm from the shoulder to the elbow has been preserved as well as a section of the adjoining part of the back and breast (Efimenko 1958:364, Fig. 152:2). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 24 (Pis. VII:4 and VIII: 4, Coll. 6223/15). Found in 1936 in Square R-23. The material is compact marl, yellowish in color. Height, 2 cm.; width, 2.3 cm. This is the upper part of the back of a female figurine. Both shoulders can be distinguished. The upper part of the right arm is shown in relief, and the left one is shown in a like manner down as far as the elbow. On the front side only a small portion of the right breast is intact, the remaining surface being rough and uneven. The back is smooth, barely protruding, and a wide band formed by two rows of alternating cogs is shown very clearly in relief. A little lower at the level of the elbow, or possibly the waist, a small bulge is noticeable. It is difficult to deter- mine what it might be since the line of the break passes close by, but it is very likely that this may be that same type of fillet that has been observed on whole figurines. The general height of this figurine was probably 5.5-6 cm. (Efimenko 1958: 363, Fig. 151, PL XX:4). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 25 (Pis. VII:3 and VIII: 17, Coll. IE, 5346/1). Found in 1915 at the time of S. A. Krukovskii's excavations, but re- mained unnoticed. It was brought to light and pub- lished in 1922 by Zamiatnin. The material is marl. Height, approximately 3 cm. It represents part of a female figurine from the waist to the knees. By its</page><page sequence="12">12 Arctic Anthropology IV -2 general character it is very close to Figurine No. 26. The sagging abdomen and buttocks are portrayed but not very clearly. The arms are barely outlined. The legs are proportional in size but have been broken off at the lower end, while the thighs and particu- larly the knees are very well shaped (Zamiatnin 1922, Fig. 3; Efimenko 1958:358-360, Fig. 147:1, PI. XX: 3). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 26 (PI. VIII: 19, Coll. IE, 6223/7). Found in 1932 in Square M-13. The material is marl of a grayish color. Height, 3.9 cm. It represents the upper part of the legs and the lower half of the torso of a female figurine ap- parently unfinished. The thighs, small abdomen, sides and lower part of the back are designated but were never finished, the latter being completely un- processed. The right leg has been broken off above the knee, and the left one right at the knee. The legs are clearly separated from each other (Efimenko 1958:358, Fig. 147:2). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 27 (Pis. VII: 7 and VIII: 20, Coll. IE, 6223/6). Found in 1936 in Square alpha 25. The material is compact, yellow- ish marl. Height, 4.9 cm. Represents the lower half of a figurine. The line of the break passes a little above the waist. On the facial side part of the flat chest has been preserved, and the arms, reposing on the abdomen, are portrayed in relief. The lower edges of the arms blend in with the ab- domen. The buttocks are not indicated, but the left thigh is well formed. The remainder of the figurine is very schematic, representing legs which are squeezed together and tapering off to a cone. The latter is broken off at the end. The lower part was formed by long, broad strokes (Efimenko 1958:358, Fig. 146:4). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 28 (Pis. VII:8 and VIII: 16, Coll. IE, 6223/23. Found in 1931 in Square H-5. The material is common grayish marl. Height, 3.7 cm. Represents the lower half of a small figurine. Its torso is massive. Instead of legs there is a kind of cone which terminates at the knees in a point. A rather deeply engraved line, probably intended to portray a strap, is located on the upper part of the thighs. The legs are separated in front by a long groove. On that part of the left thigh which is still intact small, oblique cuts which possibly represent hair or clothing can be seen. There are a number of other indications that hint at the presence of clothing on this figurine: the gen- eral outlines of the form have been smoothed out, the abdomen and buttocks are weakly expressed, and the legs have been summarily reproduced. Most interesting is the portrayal of a tail in the back. It is in the form of two vertical, thin, and rather deeply incised lines which end with a few short cuts ar- ranged in a fan shape portraying the tassel (Efimenko 1958:355-356, Fig. 145). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 29 (PI. VIII: 18, Coll. IE, 6223/3). Found in 1934 in pit house B. The material is dense chalk. The height of the frag- ment is 2.3 cm. , and the figurine when whole was probably around 3.2 to 3.5 cm. high. It represents the lower half of a small figurine schematically executed but similar in general appearance to Figu- rine No. 28. Traces of the break can be seen on the back in the region of the waist. The legs which are joined together taper off to a cone that is some- what rounded out on the end, and they are separated in the front by a deeply incised line. From the sides and in the back the pelvic area is shown by a bulge, sharply separating it from the legs (Efimenko 1958: 356, Fig. 146:3). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 30 (Coll. IE, 6223/5). Found in 1933 in Square E-16. Two frag- ments of a miniature marl figurine are represented here. One of them (height, 1.4 cm) represents the highly schematic lower part of the figurine, the legs coming together in a cone which is rounded off on the end (PI. VIII: 21); the other fragment (height, 1.8 cm.) includes the back, part of the shoulder and up- per arm (as seen from the back) which is bent at the elbow. The over-all height of this figurine may have been close to 4 cm. (Efimenko 1958:356, 358, Fig. 146:2). Fragment of Female Figurine No. 31 (Pis. IX: 1 and X:l, Coll. IE, 6223/24). Found in 1932 in Square I- 17. The material is marl. Height, 2.5 cm. Represents the head and upper part of the torso. The massive head is round and slightly tilted forward. The face is marked by wide facets of incision which are meet- ing at an angle. There is almost no neck; it is re- placed by a narrow twist separating the head from the solid, narrow and somewhat sloping shoulders. The facial portion has been partially damaged. The curve at the nape of the neck is scarcely noticeable and passes directly into the line of the back. Judging from the position of the preserved portion of the arms, they apparently met each other in front. On the pre- served part of the back there can be seen some ver- tical hatching to the right, possibly intended to portray hair falling onto the shoulders. Two deep, parallel incisions can be observed to the left on the crown of the head (Efimenko 1958:365, Fig. 153, PI. XXI: 1). Head of Female Figurine No. 32 (PI. IX: 2, Coll. 6223/25). Found in 1936 in chernozem. It is made of poor material, easily soiled marl or chalk. Height, 1.4 cm. It is the head of a small figurine with nar- row, sloping shoulders. The crown is flat, and the face is elongated; the occiput forms one continuous line with the back owing to the absence of a neck. The preservation of the fragment is very poor (Efimenko 1958:365-366, Fig. 154, PI. XXI:4). Head of Female Figurine No. 33 (PI. IX: 3, Coll. 6223/26). Found in 1931 in Square O-7. Made of</page><page sequence="13">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 13 marl. Height, 2.2 cm.; transverse diameter, 2.1 cm. Represents the head of a large figurine of which part of the neck has also been preserved. It has the usual flattened form; the face is very slightly elon- gated. The neck is short and massive, the occiput blending together with the contours of the back. The features look as though they had all been smoothed away, but this can evidently be attributed to the poor quality of the material (Efimenko 1958:366, Fig. 155). Head of Female Figurine No. 34 (Pis. DC: 6 and X:3, Coll. IE, 6223/2 7). Found in 1934 in chernozem in Excavation IV. Made of marl. Height, 3.5 cm.; width, 3 cm. A small adjoining portion of the neck has been preserved. The head is quite flat and tilts forward in the usual manner. The short massive neck which is intact only in the front is emphasized by a curving engraved line. The occiput rises abruptly upward, and the back of the head was fin- ished with long, vertical facets. The facial side, however, has been carefully smoothed out. The character of the break indicates that the head was broken off by a strong blow at the base of the occiput (Efimenko 1958:366, Fig. 156). Head of Female Figurine No. 35 (Pis. DC: 5 and X:4, Coll. IE, 6223/28). Found in 1934 in backdirt of Excavation III. Made of marl. Height, 5.8 cm.; transverse diameter of the head, 5.2 cm. Represents the head of a very large figurine of which part of the neck has been preserved. The outline of the head has been reproduced in the usual spherical manner with the crown being considerably flattened out. The entire surface of this head has been care- fully processed; a groove separates it from a very thick, massive neck. The crown is covered with thin, circular strokes, and on one side there are several long deep stripes. On the occiput, which is partially damaged in this area, can be seen some short, sharp incisions, as though portraying hair. A fairly assymetrical bulge, which must represent the face, has two rows of vertical hachures meeting at an angle. It is possible that the different type of treatment here is meant to suggest a particular form of hair-do, a cap, or hair (Efimenko 1958:366, Fig. 157, PI. XXI: 6). Head of Female Figurine No. 36 (PI. DC: 7, Coll. IE, 6223/29). Found in 1936 in Square A-25. Made of marl. Height, 1.4 cm.; width, 1.5 cm. Part of the neck is intact. The outlines of this head are the usual flattened crown with the face tilted slightly downwards and a steep line for the back of the head. On the facial side the head is separated from the body by some circular grooves which are evidently intended to portray the folds under the chin, and for this reason they cannot be observed on the reverse side (Efimenko 1958:367, Fig. 158:7). Head of Female Figurine No. 37 (Coll. IE, 6223/ 30). Found in 1936 in Square S-17. Made of marl. Height, 1.8 cm. Represents a rather amorphous frag- ment with a portion of the neck. It apparently shows a little of a forward tilted face (Efimenko 1958:367). Head of Female Figurine No. 38. Found in 1934 in pit house B. Made of compat yellowish marl. It is partially preserved and represents a small part of the head, part of the neck, and the right shoulder. The height of this fragment is 1.9 cm. (Efimenko 1958:367). Head of Female Figurine No. 39 (PL IX: 8, Coll. IE, 6223/31). Found in 1934 in Square A-15. Made of marl. It is of an unusual form since the crown is oval in plan, but entirely flat on top. The height is 2.4 cm. It has been carefully worked and smoothed out, and the break at the neck has been deliberately evened off. Circular cuts can be seen in places along the edge (Efimenko 1958:367, Fig. 158:3). Head of Female Figurine No. 40 (PI. DC:9, Coll. IE, 6223/32). Found in 1932 in Square 1-15. Made of marl. Height, 2.2 cm.; width, 2.4 cm. It is of the form usual for the majority of heads. The line of the occiput rises upward abruptly and straight and then passes onto the wide, flat crown which is in- clined a little forwards and down. The face has been reproduced by vertical carving (Efimenko 1958: 367-368, Fig. 158:4). Head of Female Figurine No. 41 (PI. IX: 10, Coll. IE, 6223/33). Found in 1932 in Square 1-16. Made of soft chalk. Height, 2 cm.; width, 2.6 cm. The head is treated in a peculiar fashion; the proportions are a little exaggerated in that the width is consider- ably greater than either the height or the diameter. The back of the head has steep lines, the crown looks as though it had been flattened out, and the face, which has been reproduced as one flat surface, is tilted downwards (Efimenko 1958:368, Fig. 158:2). Head of Female Figurine No. 42 (PI. IX:11, Coll. IE, 6223/34). Found in 1931 in Square H-5. Made of marl. Height, 2 cm.; longitudinal diameter (from the chin to the occiput), 2.2 cm. The head is of in- terest inasmuch as its face is turned forward and to all appearances even raised upwards instead of downwards, the latter being the case with the majority of figurines. The details of this face are rendered in a conventionalized fashion. The eyes are designated by vague depressions of different dimensions but are placed at the same level; the nose is formed by two wide facets meeting at an angle. Nevertheless, the face is very expressive and animated. Another in- teresting detail is the sharp deep line which sep- arates the face from the protruding occipital part. It is more than likely that it was meant to portray a flat round cap (Efimenko 1958:368, Fig. 159, PI. XXI: 3). Head of Female Figurine No. 43 (Coll. IE, 6223/35). Found in 1933 in Square G-18. Made of marl. Height, 1.7 cm.; transverse length, 2.3 cm. This head is without details. It is oval, flattened on top, and has</page><page sequence="14">4 Arctic Anthropology IV -2 the appearance of a facetted sphere (Efimenko 19 58: 368). Head of Female Figurine No. 44 (PL IX: 14, Coll. IE, 6223/36). Found in 1936 in Square L-26. Made of marl. Height, 1.5 cm.; width, 2.3 cm. (PL 10:14). The head is flat and of an unusual form. The break can be noticed in the neck area. The forepart of the crown protrudes markedly and from its appearance resembles a kokoshnik.* Over part of the head there are thin, irregularly distributed, short hachures (Efimenko 1958:368, Fig. 158:8). Head of Female Figurine No. 45 (PL ÌX:13, Coll. IE, 6223/37). Found in 1932 in Square L-13. Made of marl. Height, 1.7 cm.; width, 2.3 cm. It has a flattened form, and it is considerably wider in cross section than in longitudinal direction or in height. It is rather unexpressive and evidently was not en- tirely completed although the general features are indicated (Efimenko 1958:368, Fig. 158:6). Head of Female Figurine No. 46 (Coll. IE, 6223/ 38). Found in 1932 in Square L-13. Made of marl. Height, 2.1 cm.; transverse diameter, 2.6 cm. This head has had no finishing touches. The carving marks are quite rough, but they do outline the basic features. The occiput rises abruptly, the crown is flat, and the face tilts downward (Efimenko 1958: 368). Head of Female Figurine No. 47 (Coll. IE, 6223/ 39). Found in 1936 in Squares beta, 19, 20, 21. Made of marl. Height, 1.9 cm.; width, 1.6 cm. Represents the head of a small figurine which had apparently not received the finishing touches. The break occurred in the area of the neck. The face, as usual, tilts downwards. Wide facets form a low pyramid on the upper part of the head, perhaps in- tended to portray a cap (Efimenko 1958:3 68). Head of Female Figurine No. 48 (PL IX: 4, Coll. IE, 6223/40). Found in 1936 in Square Q-20. Made of marl. Height, 2.6 cm. This head has been processed only in the rough. The crown has been completely flattened, the face protrudes, is crudely fashioned, and is abruptly separated from the neck. On the reverse side, the wide facets of the carving marks and the grooves in between them form the back of the head and that part of the neck which is still in- tact (Efimenko 1958:370, Fig. 158:5). Head of Female Figurine No. 49 (Coll. IE, 6223/41). Found in 1936 in Squares E, F-21. Made of whitish, easily soiled marl. Height, 1.3 cm. This head is a fairly unexpressive, facetted sphere on which vari- ous bulges can be seen in some places and in one case the bulge may be the remains of a neck (Efimen- ko 1958:370). A type of woman's headdress worn in old Rus- sia. - Trans. Head of Female Figurine No. 50 (PL DC: 15, Coll. IE, 6223/42). Found in 1931 in Square K-10. Made of marl. Height, 1.1 cm.; width, 0.9 cm. This is a miniature head with a comparatively long thin neck on which traces of the break can be seen. It pos- sesses all the characteristic features of the Kostenki heads - a certain flattening and a forward inclined and projecting face (Efimenko 1958:3 70, Fig. 158:1). Head of Female Figurine No. 51 (Pis. IX: 12 and X: 2, Coll. IE, 6223/43). Found in 1936 in Square O- 26. Made of compact yellowish marl. Height, 2.1 cm.; width, 3 cm. It has a flattened and somewhat elon- gated form. There is now a hole in the place where the neck used to be, apparently deliberate in origin, which was made after the head was broken. Rows of small crescent-shaped incisions which are divided in some places by thin vertical lines are noticeable over approximately half of the protruding part of the head. This design is well preserved closer to the occiput, but it has been somewhat effaced toward the front (Efimenko 1958:370, Fig. 160, PL XXI:5). Head of Female Figurine No. 52. Found in 1933 in Square E-13. Made of marl. Height, 2.3 cm. Repre- sents a fragment of the head and part of the shoulder of a figurine. Rows of deep slanting cuts are notice- able on the preserved surface (Efimenko 1958:371). Head of Female Figurine No. 53. Found in 1932 in Square L-14. Made of marl. Height, 1.5 cm. Repre- sents a small round head with the break in the neck area (Efimenko 1958:371). Fragment of a Thin Slab with an Engraved Repre- sentation of a Woman (Pis. IX: 16 and X:5, Coll. IE, 6223/88). Found in 1931 in Square D-5 in a pit. This is a piece of a massive slab of compact marl 8.2 cm. high. On its well polished surface are the deeply grooved contours depicting that type of woman usually found in Kostenki I. Here can be seen the flattened head with somewhat angular out- lines, a torso crossed by a shoulder belt in the form of a double line above the breast, the huge pendulous left breast, and the left arm which is held to one side as though holding something. Evidently only a com- paratively small part of this slab has been preserved, namely its upper right quarter. There is evidence that the edge of this fragment has been finished, and from this one may conclude that this object, when whole, must have had the appearance of a massive slab or stela rounded on top (Efimenko 1958:379- 380, Fig. 165). Seated Figurines. Aside from the above-mentioned realistic portrayals of women, there are also a num- ber of stylized objects of an anthropomorphic char- acter from Kostenki I. Three figurines may be classi- fied as belonging to this type, one of which was broken and therefore not too expressive. The first of these was found in 1936 in Square F-29 (PL IX: 17, Coll. IE, 6223/44). It is made of marl and has a height of 2.8 cm. It represents the</page><page sequence="15">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U .S .S .R. 15 middle part of a rather small female figurine, evi- dently seated. The upper part of the body was broken off approximately at the waist, and the ends of the legs have also been broken. The preserved portion of the legs (thighs) extend at an angle from the torso (Efimenko 1958:374, Fig. 161:1). The second figurine was found in 1931 in Square L-7 (PI. IX: 18, Coll. IE, 6223/45). It is made of marl and has a length of 3.5 cm. This is a con- ventionalized reproduction of a seated female figu- rine broken off at the waist. The torso is leaning back slightly, the buttocks have the characteristi- cally rounded look, and the legs are held together in an extended position. This figurine has been carefully finished by longitudinal carving, and the break was smoothed out (Efimenko 1958:374, Fig. 161:4). The third figurine was found in 1934 in backdirt in Excavation I (PI. IX: 19, Coll. IE, 6223/46). It is made of marl. Length, 5.1 cm. As with the preced- ing female figurine, it recalls in a conventionalized fashion the lower half of a seated woman. Traces of carefully carved facets come together toward the base of the figure (Efimenko 1958:374, Fig. 161:5). ANTHROPOMORPHIC PORTRAYALS. There are a series of other sculptured objects which recall even less human portrayals, and only individual de- tails enable us to recognize their anthropomorphic character. Baton with Spherical Knob (PI. XI: 1 , Coll. IE, 6218/ 1575). Found in storage pit No. 17 in Square N-8 together with two large figurines. Made from mam- moth ivory. Length, 29.5 cm. Represents a long, flattened handle with a marked thickening at the base. Toward the opposite end it grows narrower and then terminates in a spherical knob which has a certain forward inclination. There is a long cyl- indrical knob on the handle of this sphere, and slightly below the sphere on the handle a small bulge can be seen. This object has no analogy in the Upper Palaeolithic sites of Europe. Because of its fragility it is very possible that this object did not have a practical use. Efimenko suggests that one might regard it as a conventionalized portrayal of a human figure serving as either a sceptre or wand, since neither of the latter have so much a practical use as they do a cult purpose (Efimenko 1958:301, Fig. 111:1). Shaft of Mammoth Ivory (PI. XI:3, Coll. IE, 6218/ 1544). Found in pit house V [Russian letter - Trans.]. Length, 23 cm. Its function is unclear. The pres- ervation is poor since the ivory has exfoliated. Nevertheless, in the upper part one may perceive the representation of a human figure - a rounded head and the general contours of a body (Efimenko 1958:317-318, Fig. 125:5). Sculptured Object Made of Mammoth Ivory (PL XI: 2). Found in Excavation II in 1923. Length, 5.3 cm. Represents a short pointed shaft with an asymmetri- cally placed wide cap tilted forward. On the facial side below the cap, the shaft was decorated with three parallel engraved lines. In outward appearance, the upper part of the object, when it is turned upside down, has a superficial resemblance to the leg and huge round foot of a camel. Efimenko, however, pre- fers to regard such objects as conventionalized re- productions of the usual female form with that same, distinctive flatness of the crown and with the in- clined head (Efimenko 1958:318, Fig. 124:12). Anthropomorphic Heads. Kostenki I has yielded seven such heads, all of them being made of marl. Each of them has traits both human and of some kind of animal. All of them were found within the com- paratively limited space of a living area (from the 24th to the 29th rows of squares) around two hearths. Head No. 1 (Pis. X:6 and XII: 1 , Coll. IE, 6223/142). Found in 1934 in Square M-24. It was made of marl and has the following measurements: length, 4 cm.; height, 3.6 cm.; thickness, 1.3 cm. It is a clearly outlined, flattened head. The left and right sides represent different masks, and are executed in high relief. An ape-like muzzle is reproduced simul- taneously with the combined features of a human and a camel on the left side of this strange image. A little knob-like crown rises over the quadrangular, elongated muzzle with its long nose, low brow, and thick lips. The right side evidently should have duplicated the left, but on the contrary, here the de- tails are more similar to those of a camel. The back of the head bears traces of breakage, but on the pre- served part there is portrayed a powerful neck jutting forward, and these traits, together with the general set of the head, again remind one of the character- istic features of a camel (Efimenko 1958:394, 396, Fig. 185, PI. XXX). It is difficult to say whether or not the inhabi- tants of Kostenki I had any knowledge of the camel since their bones have not been discovered in Pa- laeolithic sites within the U.S.S.R. , with the excep- tion of those found in the Upper Palaeolithic site of Pechor in eastern Kazakhstan. It is more likely that the anthropomorphic heads from Kostenki represent portrayals of half realistic, half mythological creatures of a type of widely known masks in West European Palaeolithic art. Head No. 2 (Pis. X: 7 and XII:5, Coll. 6223/143). Found in 1934 in Square 1-26. Length, 3.5 cm.; thick- ness, 1.2 cm; height, 2.5 cm. This head is similar to the first one except that it is depicted on a small slab of marl, the technique of which approaches that of the contour decoupee. A long muzzle with a nose extending to the lips and a narrow engraved mouth is accurately portrayed on the left side of the slab. The opposite side is also shaped, but the two wide cuts across the muzzle make it less expressive. The</page><page sequence="16">16 Arctic Anthropology IV -2 eyes are depicted on both sides by two round pro- tuberances. Slanting, strongly emphasized hachures on the lower end of the muzzle were possibly meant to portray hairs. This head resembles a fantastic distortion of the human face with some similarity to an animal's muzzle more than anything else (Efimen- ko 1958:396-397, Fig. 186, PI. XXIX: 2). Head No. 3 (PI. XII: 6, Coll. IE, 6223/144). Found in 1936 in Square I, K-29. It is made of marl and has the following measurements: length, 4.2 cm.; height, 3.2 cm.; thickness, 2.5 cm. It is very reminiscent of the previous head, but it is not as well finished. It is very possible that this finishing was limited only to the facial parts including the chin. This head also portrays some kind of fantastic creature. It has a high, knob-like forehead, a long narrow face, and the nose is accentuated on the tip by a small lump. A few clearly engraved lines can be seen on the left side of the latter (Efimenko 1958: 397, Fig. 187, PI. XXIX: 3). Head No. 4 (PI. XII:4, Coll. IE, 6223/145). Found in 1934 in Square M-24. It is made of chalk which is easily soiled, and it is in a poor state of preserva- tion. Height, 2.7 cm.; length, 3.2 cm.; width, 2 cm. This head possesses the basic features of the same fantastic creature as have the previous ones: the small, round, knob-like crown, the narrow, elon- gated muzzle with its long nose. The back of this head has an oblique break on it. One eye is shown in relief, the other one as a rather small indentation. The tip of the muzzle has been broken off (Efimenko 1958:397, Fig. 188:3). Head No. 5 (PI. XII: 2, Coll. IE, 6223/146). Found in 1934 in Square 1-24. Made of marl. Height, 3 cm.; thickness, 2 cm.; length of the muzzle, 2.4 cm. Represents a fragment of an anthropomorphic head with a small, round, knob-like skull and a long, broad muzzle. The forehead is parted by a deep transverse line, and at the place where the left eye should be there is a little round indentation, pos- sibly of natural origin (Efimenko 1958:397, Fig. 188:1). Head No. 6 (PI. XII: 3, Coll. IE, 6223/147). Found in 1934 together with Head No. 5 in Square 1-24. Length, 3.2 cm.; thickness, 1.4 cm.; height, 3 cm. The basis of this head was evidently a natural con- cretion of marl having the outlines of the head of a creature of fantasy. The head has been carefully finished. There is the round, knob-like crown and the narrow muzzle which juts forward and looks as though its lower lip had been folded back. Part of the thin neck is still intact, and round eyes were hollowed out on both sides of the head. In spite of the thorough workmanship it is difficult to make out just what this mask is supposed to resemble. Cer- tain features recall those of a camel, while others suggest those of the saiga (Efimenko 1958:397, 399, Fig. 188:2). Head No. 7 (PI. XII: 7, Coll. IE, 6223/148). Found in 1936 in Square F-26. Length, 6.1 cm.; height, 3.4 cm.; thickness, 2.4 cm. On one side of a massive slab made of bluish gray marl there is depicted a near human likeness with the nose and brow formed by the same line. The head is portrayed in profile by the contour technique (Efimenko 1958:399, Fig. 188:4, PI. XXIX: 1). MEDALLIONS. In conclusion we will discuss articles of a totally different nature but undoubtedly related to the images of women. These are peculiar objects of marl found in Kostenki I, and previously unknown in Palaeolithic sites. Efimenko calls them medallions, since in form they do indeed recall a regular semi- circular form with the characteristic oval hollow placed vertically and centrally near the upper en- graved edge. Some ten such objects were found, mostly concentrated in the central part of a dwelling in a comparatively small space. Medallion No. 1 (PI. XIII: 1, Coll. IE, 6223/92). Found in 1933 in Square P-ll. Height, 2.7 cm.; width, 3.2 cm. Made of grayish marl and is thick lenticular in section. The facial side is somewhat flat, and the reverse is strongly convex. A deeply incised line goes across the upper part. A deep oval pit descends from the center of this line (Efimenko 1958:381, Fig. 167:2, PI. XXIII: 3, 7). Medallion No. 2 (PI. XIII: 2, Coll. IE, 6223/93). Found in the same square as Medallion No. 1. This medal- lion is similar in form to the latter, but its dimen- sions (height, 2.3 cm.; width, 3 cm.) are slightly smaller. The facial side is flat and the reverse is sharply convex. A double arc is deeply engraved on the facial side (Efimenko 1958:382, Fig. 167:1, PI. XXIII: 2, 4). Medallion No. 3 (Pis. X:8 and XIII: 8, Coll. IE, 6223/ 94). Found in 1932 in Square L-15. Height, 2.2 cm.; width, 3.6 cm. This medallion is of the usual type, but it lacks the transverse line. An oval pit is lo- cated in the center of the upper edge (Efimenko 1958: 382, Fig. 167:4, PI. XXIII: 5). Medallion No. 4 (Pis. X:ll and XIII:4, Coll. IE, 6223/ 95). Found in 1934 in Excavation I. Height, 3.3 cm.; width, 3.3 cm. It has a large, deep, oval pit begin- ning on the upper edge. On the opposite more flat side there is the usual transverse groove and a small oval pit. Apparently this was originally in- tended to be the facial side (Efimenko 1958:382, Fig. 168:1, PI. XXII: 3). Medallion No. 5 (Pis. X:9 and XIII: 7, Coll. IE, 6223/ 96). Found in 1933 in Square E-16. Its dimensions are 2.5 X 3 cm. This medallion has a regular semi- circular shape in the form of a section of a thick lens. There is a deep oval pit in the center of the upper part (Efimenko 1958:382, Fog. 167:3, PI. XXIII: 1). Medallion No. 6 (PI. XIII: 3, Coll. IE, 6223/97). Found</page><page sequence="17">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 17 in 1932 in Square 1-18. Its dimensions are 3.4 X 5.9 cm. This is the largest of the medallions and is wide and massive with a markedly convex reverse side. A deep oval cavity has been hollowed out on the upper edge (Efimenko 1958:382, Fig. 168:5, PL XXII:4). Medallion No. 7 (Pis. X:10 and XIII:5, Coll. IE, 6223/98). Found in 1936 in Square C-21. Dimen- sions, 2.9 X 3.4 cm. This medallion is almost round in form and has a markedly convex reverse side. The flat side is incised with the usual transverse line which is intercepted by an oval hole (Efimenko 1958:382-383, Fig. 168:3, PI. XXIII:6). Medallion No. 8 (PI. XIII:6, Coll. IE, 6223/99). Found in 1931 in Square L-10. Height, 2.3 cm.; width, 3.5 cm.; thickness, up to 2 cm. This is a crudely fashioned example apparently not finished on the reverse side. On the facial side there is a small round pit from which a vertical line descends (Efimenko 1958:383, Fig. 168:4). Medallion No. 9 (Coll. IE, 6223/100). Found in 1933 in Square G-16. Its dimensions are 3.4 X 3.2 cm. An almost round medallion of double convex form with an oblong hollow on the upper part of the facial side. Traces of wide carving marks can be seen on the surface (Efimenko 1958:383, Fig. 169:3). Evidently there is still one more example (No. 10) that should be placed in this category of objects. It possesses all the basic features of the other medallions, but the upper part has been broken off. Its width is 2.9 cm. (Coll. IE, 6223/101; see Efimenko 1958:383). There are three blanks for similar artifacts which possess the basic features (PI. XIII:9, Coll. IE, 6223/102-104; see Efimenko 1958:383, Fig. 168:2). In addition to the medallions, oval plaques of clay were found, their facial sides being well smoothed out and the vertical lines arranged in much the same fashion as the medallions (Coll. IE, 6223/105-109; see Efimenko 1958:384, Fig. 169: 1,4). PORTRAYALS OF ANIMALS . A rich collection of animal representations was collected from Kostenki I. Figurines of the mammoth and heads of the cave lion, bear, wolf, and even birds are represented here. Along with these distinct portrayals were also found heads and figurines that undoubtedly represent ani- mals, but it is difficult to determine to what species they belong. We will proceed with the description of these works according to animal species. PORTRAYALS OF THE MAMMOTH, In Kostenki I there were found ten figurines which without doubt may be considered sculptured portrayals of the mam- moth. They are executed quite schematically, and despite the absence of many of the details the ma- jority of them possess the characteristic features of that animal - the small head which is semi-circular in contour, the humped back which slopes steeply toward the rear, and the trunk which is indicated by two lines. As a rule the base of these figurines had been evened off and sometimes even polished in order to preserve a stable upright posture. Especially characteristic of the portrayal of the mammoth are figurines Nos. 1 through 6. Four objects are possibly blanks for such figurines, but they appear to be in- complete (Nos. 7 through 10). Mammoth Figurine No. 1 (Pis. XIV: 1 and XV: 1, Coll. IE, 6223/110). Found in 1934 in pit house B [Russian letter] in Square A- 16. Made of marl. Length, 2.7 cm.; height, 2.3 cm.; thickness, 1.4 cm. This figurine is the most typical and also the most graceful of the entire series. The small, upward protruding head is separated from the back by a sharp bend, and ter- minates in a trunk that descends to the forelegs. The contours of the back are quite smooth, and the hind- quarters are very low, the hind legs seem slightly bent. The base is even, smoothly carved, and the surface of the figurine itself is carefully smoothed out. Judging by this figurine, it seems evident that the Palaeolithic artist was able to correctly repro- duce the characteristic traits of the mammoth by a minimum of very simple fashioning (Efimenko 1958: 385-386, Fig. 170, PL XXIV:4). Mammoth Figurine No. 2 (Pis. XIV:2 and XV:2, Coll. IE, 6223/111). Found in 1934 in the same pit house in Square B-15. Made of marl. Length, 2.2 cm.; height, 2.8 cm.; thickness, 1.2 cm. Analogous to Figurine No. 1, differing from it only by smaller dimensions and a little less care in the finishing. The main feature of this figurine is the portrayal of its trunk in relief. An engraved line separates the trunk from the body on both sides, slanting down- ward as though to depict its natural taper (Efimenko 1958:386, Fig. 171). Mammoth Figurine No. 3 (Pis. XIV:3 and XV:4, Coll. IE, 6223/11-2). Found in 1933 in Square P-12. Made of marl. Length, 2.5 cm.; height, 2 cm.; thickness, 1.2 cm. Possesses all the same characteristic features of the foregoing figurines. Just as was the case with Figurine No. 2, the trunk again is sep- arated from the body by a deep engraved line running somewhat obliquely. Another line is placed at an angle to that line, and because of that the impres- sion is created that this animal is sitting with his legs tucked under him. The base of this figurine has been broken, and for this reason the possibility should not be ruled out that this may be an entirely different portrayal, but we have included it among the mammoth figurines purely on formal grounds (Efimenko 1958:386-387, Fig. 172, PL XXIV: 1). Mammoth Figurine No. 4 (Pis. XIV:6 and XV:3, Coll. IE, 6223/1] 3). Found in 1936 in the chernozem over the excavation. Made of marl. Length, 2.3 cm.; height, 2.2 cm.; thickness, 1.5 cm. Has all of the</page><page sequence="18">18 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 characteristic features of the previous figurines with the exception of slightly different proportions. The huge head projects considerably over the lines of the back. The torso is disproportionately short, and the hind-quarters and base have been damaged by a series of facets of chipping running in different directions. In general the preservation of this figu- rine is poor (Efimenko 1958:387, Fig. 173). Mammoth Figurine No. 5 (PI. XIV:4, Coll. IE, 6223/ 114). Found in 1931 in Square P-7. Made of marl. Length, 2.9 cm.; height, 2.4 cm.; thickness, 1.4 cm. Because of its poor state of preservation this figu- rine creates the impression that it has much more in common with the previous ones than it really has. The head is small and resembles a cone in profile. The trunk is denoted by an engraved line only on the lower part of one side. The surface of the hind- quarters is uneven, and this gives the impression that the hind legs are in different positions, the right one remaining behind, the left one advancing forward. The base of the figurine has been carved off evenly (Efimenko 1958:387, Fig. 174:2). Mammoth Figurine No. 6 (PI. XIV: 7, Coll. IE, 6223/ 115). Found in 1933 in Square Q-12. Made of marl. Length, 3.7 cm.; height, 3 cm.; thickness, 1.7 cm. This figurine is comparatively large and massive. The usual traits for this type of figurine have been reproduced schematically - the small head, the bow- shaped lines of the back, and the steeply falling lines of the long trunk. Even broad carving marks can be seen on the flat left side and rear, while on the right side long transverse hachures are observed. The base has been flattened and smoothed out. On the whole this portrayal is rather generalized (Efimenko 1958:387, Fig. 174:1). There are still four more figurines which may be considered as blanks or as uncompleted sculptures. Figurine No. 7 (PI. XIV: 5, Coll. IE, 4464/2). Found in 1923 in Excavation II. It is made of marl and has equal measurements for both length and height - 3.8 cm. For all appearances this figurine was sub- jected to only the initial processing and was never completed. The characteristic silhouette of the head and back allow one to consider it a portrayal of the mammoth (Efimenko 1958:388, Fig. 176). Figurine' No. 8 (Coll. IE, 6223/117). Found in 1936 in the chernozem over the excavation. Made of marl. Length, 2.9 cm.; height, 2 cm.; thickness, 1.2 cm. Judging by its general contours this was a blank for the usual little mammoth figurine (Efimenko 1958: 388). Figurine No. 9 (Coll. IE, 6223/118). Found in 1936 in Squares E, F-21. Made of marl. Length, 2.7 cm.; height, 2 cm.; thickness, 0.5 cm. This is also a blank for a little mammoth figurine done in the usual generalized manner, but it is more flattened in com- parison with the other figurines (Efimenko 1958: 388). Figurine No. 10. Found in 1936 in Square P-18. Made of marl. Length, 2.8 cm.; height, 2.2 cm.; thickness, 1.8 cm. This is the usual small mam- moth figurine but is only contoured in the rough. Its base has been carved off evenly. In spite of its schematization and simplicity, this figurine cannot be separated from the rest of the series (Efimenko 1958:388). Aside from the entire series of mammoth figurines that has just been reviewed, a few other animal figu- rines were discovered at Kostenki I which as a gen- eral rule seem to lack their front parts as though someone had intentionally knocked off their heads and forelegs. Therefore, because of the insufficient amount of detail in these portrayals of animals, one can equally consider them as either figurines of the mammoth or the rhinoceros. Figurine No. 1 (Pis. XIV: 8 and XV: 6, Coll. IE, 6223/ 116). Found in 1932 in Square K-15. Made of marl. Length, 3.7 cm.; height, 3 cm.; thickness, 1.8 cm. This is a comparatively large animal figurine on which the head and forelegs are missing. Efimenko sees many of the characteristic traits of mammoth representations: the massive torso, humped withers, huge sagging belly, the short tail, and the hind legs which are joined together, but these characteristics have been treated differently here than on the mam- moth figurines: The hind legs stand out, coming to- gether to form a cone, and a clear-cut line divides one from the other. According to V. E. Garutt, the triangular form of the short thick tail when viewed from behind is most characteristic of portrayals of the rhinoceros.* Because of the liveliness of its execution and reproduction of details, this figurine fragment may be considered one of the best in the collection from Kostenki I (Efimenko 1958:388, Fig. 175, PI. XXIV: 3). Figurine No. 2 (Pis. XIV: 11 and XV: 5, Coll. IE, 6223/172). Found in 1932 in Squares MN-11, 12. Made of marl. Length, 4 cm.; height, 3.4 cm.; thick- ness, 2.5 cm. This animal figurine has a fully fin- ished look. Its foreparts have been carefully smoothed down, but it apparently was intentionally made with- out a head. The body is short, quite stout, and oval in section. The lines of the back curve. The front and back legs are shown in the form of two short thick projections, the front being a little longer than the back. At the back there is a rather wide but short tail asymmetrically located closer to the left side. This figurine is very much like the previous one but cruder in execution. From all indications it, too, portrays a rhinoceros (Efimenko 1958:405-406, Fig. 194, PI. XXIV: 2). I wish to take this opportunity to offer my deep gratitude to V. E. Garutt who examined the collection of animal figurines from Kostenki I and expressed his opinion about certain of them.</page><page sequence="19">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 19 Figurine No . 3 (PI. XIV: 12, Coll. IE, 6223/173). Found in 1934 in Squares K, L-26, 27. Made of marl. Length, 4 cm.; height, 2.6 cm. thickness, 1.4 cm. This is a distinctive figurine which can be examined from various points of view. On one side it looks like an animal with erect ears, a rather small muz- zle, a wooly covering hanging down from the chest, and forelegs that have the appearance of a small rounded projection. But if this figurine were to be turned around, then the humped back, small lowered head, and scarcely depicted front and back legs would completely resemble the typical portrayal of the mammoth from Kostenki. The five short parallel grooves on the hump were probably intended to portray wooly hairs. Garutt thinks that this figurine represents a rhinoceros with high withers and a lowered head. Its generalized nature, however, offers the possibility of a third explanation, and that is that this figurine, especially when viewed from one side, resembles the head of a horse in pro- file (Efimenko 1958:406, Fig. 195. Figurine Fragment No. 4 (PI. XIV:9, Coll. 6223/174). Found in 1931 in backdirt. The material is marl. Length, 3.1 cm. Represents a schematically exe- cuted animal figurine. The head is missing and the foreparts have been broken off. Two pairs of ex- tremities are indicated, each pair being joined to- gether. The hind quarters have been smoothed out. On the whole this figurine closely resembles Fig- urine No. 2. This one (No. 4) may also be a por- trayal of a rhinoceros with high withers (Efimenko 1958:406, Fig. 196). Figurine Fragment No. 5 (PI. XIV: 10, Coll. IE, 6223/175). Found in 1932 in Square 1-14. The ma- terial is marl. Length, 3.1 cm.; height, 3.2 cm. Represents the rear half of an animal figurine. The hindquarters are joined together and have the appear- ance of a protuberance (Efimenko 1958:406, Fig. 197). Figurine Fragment No. 6 (Coll. IE, 6223/176). Found in 1936 in Square H-22, 23. The material is marl. Length, 3.5 cm. Represents the rear part of a flat animal figurine consisting of a rounded croup, massive torso, and the hind extremities which are joined together. This figurine has been carefully fashioned and smoothed (Efimenko 1958:406). It is difficult to comment on the latter fragments (Nos. 5 and 6), but judging by the available details, one is more inclined to regard them as figures of the rhinoceros rather than the mammoth. The following large group of portrayals from Kostenki I are made up of animals and have been fashioned from marl. They consist chiefly of the heads of carnivores such as the cave lion, bear, and wolf, but there are also heads of birds and even a number of nondescript heads perhaps represent- ing those of the horse or saiga, etc. PORTRAYALS OF THE CAVE LION. Five heads were found at Kostenki I which may, with some de- gree of certainty, be classified as portrayals of the cave lion. Head No. I (Pis. XVI: 3 and XVII: 2, Coll. IE, 6223/120). Found in 1936 in Square G-29. Made of marl. Length, 2 cm.; height, 1.5 cm.; thickness, 1.3 cm. This head is distinguished by its expressiveness in the repro- ductions of the essential details and general ap- pearance of this animal, and for this reason it can rightly be considered among the very best examples of Palaeolithic sculpture. The round, graceful head rests on a powerful neck. The muzzle is short and has a clearly expressed nose and mouth. The alert, pricked-up ears have been reproduced with special care. The eyes have the appearance of two pro- truding dots, the right one being damaged. Traces of the break can be seen at the base of the neck (Efimenko 1958:389-390, Fig. 178, PI. XXV:2). Head No. 2 (Pis. XVI: 2 and XVII: 5, Coll. IE, 6223/119). Found in 1934 in Square B-14. The material is yel- lowish marl. Length, 3.5 cm.; height, 3.3 cm.; thick- ness, 1.4 cm. This is a rather small head and the short, massive muzzle looks as though it had been lopped off. The brow is low, the jaws are parted, and the nostrils and round, bulging eyes have the characteristic outlines. Both of the flat sides have been executed in the bas-relief technique with suf- ficient expressiveness, but the transition from the head to the neck was not finished. The latter still retains traces of the break. When the head is viewed from the top, its form is almost symmetrical. Without a doubt it portrays the same kind of an animal as does the previous one, but there is less detail, the execution is cruder, and it is not as real- istic (Efimenko 1958:389, Fig. 177, PI. XXV: 1). Head Fragment No. 3 (PI. XVI: 1 , Coll. IE, 6223/124). Found in 1936 in Square G-31. The material is marl. The width and the length are both 2.6 cm. This frag- ment portrays the muzzle of a carnivore. The narrow nose stands out in relief, and along its sides are some round projections apparently meant to portray the typical "side-whiskers" of a tiger but not its saber-like fangs as Efimenko assumes. The jaws are portrayed by a wide slit and the chin is bifurcated. The upper part of the head has been broken off, but despite its fragmentary condition, the portrayal is realistic. The animation of this portrayal is further heightened by some sharp vertical hachures that have been placed parallel to each other on each side of the muzzie evidently for the special purpose of imitating hanging tufts of fur (Efimenko 1958:391, Fig. 182, PI. XXVIII: 1). Head Fragment No. 4 (PI. XVI:4, Coll. IE, 6223/126). Found in 1934 in Squares P, Q, R-15. Made of marl. Length, 2.4 cm.; height, 2.2 cm.; thickness, 1.4 cm. It has been shaped on one side only, but its round</page><page sequence="20">20 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 form and short muzzle most of all resemble the out- line of a lion's head. In addition to the character- istic round bulging eyes there are two deep lines which go from the top to the bottom of the head, and perpendicular to these on the back of the head there are a few short lines. It is very probable that these were intended to portray a mane (Efimenko 1958:392, Fig. 183:2). Head Fragment No. 5 (PI. XVI: 5, Coll. 6223/129). Found in 1936 in Square E-30. The material is marl. Length, 2.6 cm.; height, 2 cm.; thickness, 1.6 cm. By its general outlines one may assume that this head is supposed to portray one of the members of the cat family. It has a rounded, somewhat flattened form, symmetrically protruding ears in an erect posi- tion, and round, widely spaced, bulging eyes (Efimenko 1958:392, Fig. 183:4). PORTRAYALS OF THE BEAR. There are very few bear heads from Kostenki I, and among these there are only a few that have enough of the character- istics of the bear to permit easy identification. Head No. I (Pis. XVI: 7 and XVII: 1 , Coll. IE, 6223/ 122). Found in 1934 in Square K-21. Made of marl. Length, 4.5 cm.; height, 4 cm.; thickness, 2.5 cm. This is a fairly large head and in spite of some chipping it is still a very vivid reproduction of the characteristic features - massive triangular outlines, the prominent wide forehead, and the comparatively short muzzle. From the left side can be seen the nose, the cut of the mouth, and one ear which is especially well shaped. The surface of this side, however, is poorly preserved and shows signs of weathering. The ear on the right side was evidently broken off, and in its place there is now an oblique facet. The bulge of the forehead is depicted in re- lief. The area at the back of the head where the neck ought to be has been flattened, but there are no traces of its having been finished (Efimenko 1958:390-391, Fig. 180, PI. XXVII). Head No. 2 (Pis. XVI: 9 andXVII:3, Coll. IE, 6223/ 121). Also found in 1934 in Square K-25. Made of marl. It has much larger dimensions: length, 5.5 cm.; height, 3.5 cm.; thickness, 3.7 cm. This head has been only partially preserved since its lower part was broken off. It is a masterful reproduction of a massive, round bear's head with its wide, low brow, the broad muzzle (which looks as though it is bifurcated), small, round eyes, and powerful fangs. The latter have been reproduced in the form of linear relief along the sides of the muzzle. The left eye is in the form of a relief circle; the right one was not as well executed. Efimenko thinks that this head resembles most of all that of a tiger, but in Garutt's opinion, with which we are in agreement, the general outlines of the muzzle and the distinc- tively wide forehead resemble the features of a bear (Efimenko 1958:390, Fig. 178, PI. XXVI). There are still three heads which are less char- acteristic of the bear, but their general lines suggest that animal more than any other. Head Fragment No. 3 (PI. XVI: 10). Found in 1932 in Square 1-11. The material is marl. The dimensions are rather small: length, 2.9 cm.; width, 1.8 cm.; height, 1.8 cm. Only the front part of this head has been preserved - the prominent forehead and narrow, comparatively short muzzle which is triangular in form (Efimenko 1958:392, Fig. 183:3). Head No. 4 (PI. XVI: 11). Found in 1932 in Square K-14. Made of marl. Length, 3.8 cm.; height, 2.5 cm. This head shows weathering and has been partially broken. It has a prominent forehead and a sharpened, elongated muzzle (Efimenko 1958:392, Fig. 183:5). Head No. 5 (PI. XVI:6, Coll. IE, 6223/137). Found in 1934 in Square 1-26. Made of marl. Length, 2.8 cm.; width, 2.5 cm.; height, 3.2 cm. This head was not entirely finished, but the prominent forehead can easily be discerned along with the blunt nose that is poking out and an erect round ear which is located on the left side. The surface is very smooth. It is most likely the portrayal of a bear's head as is the case with the previous ones (Efimenko 1958:394, Fig. 184:1). A PORTRAYAL OF A WOLF (Pis. XVI: 8 and XVII: 4, Coll. IE, 6223/123). Discovered in 1936 in Square H-28. Made of marl. Length, 5.7 cm.; width, 4 cm.; height, 3 cm. This is the only wolf's head found at Kostenki I, and it has been partially broken on the lower part. Round ears project over a wide, prom- inent forehead, and the eyes have been marked in on both sides of the muzzle - the left one in the form of a broad, shallow indentation, and the right one as a little bulging lump. The long, stout nose looks as though it had been pushed over to the left side, thus causing the muzzle to have an asymmetri- cal appearance. According to Garutt, neither the wide forehead nor the far back placement of the ears is characteristic of the wolf. But he thinks this may have been a miscalculation of proportions by the artist, since the long muzzle and general contours of the head otherwise bear a strong resemblance to this animal (Efimenko 1958:391, Fig. 181, PI. XXVIII: 2). A PORTRAYAL OF A HORSE (PI. XVI: 15, Coll. IE, 6223/132). Found in 1934 in Square K-26. An animal head made of marl. Length, 4.2 cm.; width, 1.7 cm.; height, 3 cm. It has an aquiline and somewhat short- ened muzzle which was not shaped, but it is never- theless analogous to Palaeolithic portrayals of horses, thus permitting one to regard it as a repro- duction of that same animal. It is broken and par- tially weathered (Efimenko 1958:393, Fig. 184:7). In this category we must also include a frag- ment of a figurine found in 1932 in Square M-12</page><page sequence="21">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 21 (PI. XVI: 16). The material is compact yellowish marl of a good quality. The height of this fragment is 4.5 cm. Apparently it represents the hindquarters of a horse. Probably the entire figurine was carved in outline, and then the details were executed in bas- relief. On the facial side one can distinguish the hind leg and a long tail shown in relief as a narrow band with a row of transverse cuts (Efimenko 1958: 407, Fig. 198). PORTRAYALS OF UNDETERMINED ANIMALS. A number of objects made of marl were found at Kostenki I that, from all indications, seem to be representations of the heads of some kind of animals. Identifying them was very difficult in a number of cases, and it created great uncertainty. Head Fragment of an Animal, No. I . Found in stor- age pit No. IV. The material is mammoth ivory. Length, 3 cm. This is a small fragment of an elon- gated head which, judging by its general contours, resembles that of a moose. Close to the area of the break there is an elongated eye reproduced in relief (Efimenko 1958:407-408, Fig. 199). Head Fragment of an Animal, No. 2 (PI. XVI: 14, Coll. IE, 6223/131). Found in 1933 in Square E-14. The material is marl. Length, 3.9 cm.; height, 2.4 cm. Represents a smooth elongated muzzle with a rather short and weakly projecting forehead. Three cuts can be observed along the right side of the smooth surface of the muzzle. One of them looks like a sharp tooth, while the other two are in the form of punctate s. Below on the right side, a few parallel carved lines are noticeable (Efimenko 1958: 392-393, Fig. 183:6). Animal Head No. 3 (Coll. IE, 6223/141). Found in 1931 in Square L-10. Made of marl. Length, 2.3 cm.; height, 1.3 cm. This partially broken, small head has a short muzzle and small, curved horns. In Efimenko' s opinion it portrays a ram, but Garutt thinks that when viewed from another angle it looks more like a polar fox or wolf; in any case, it is a carnivore of the canine family (Efimenko 1958:394). Animal Head No. 4 (PL XVI: 12, Coll. IE, 6223/133). Found in 1932 in Square K-20. Made of marl. Length, 3.4 cm.; height, 3.1 cm.; thickness of the neck, 2.2 cm. Part of the neck is also intact. On the upper part of the flat, elongated muzzle there are the re- mains of what might have been the ears. In Efimen- ko1 s opinion the general outlines suggest the head of a goat (Efimenko 1958:393-394, Fig. 184:6). Fragment of an Animal's Head, No. 5 (Coll. IE, 6223/135). Found in 1932 in Square N-13. The ma- terial is marl. Length, 2 cm.; height, 1.5 cm.; width, 1.4 cm. One side has been smoothed down. The classification of this head as a portrayal of an ani- mal gives rise to some doubts (Efimenko 1958:394). Fragment of an Animal's Head, No. 6 (PI. XVI: 13). Found in 1936 in pit gamma, beta-19, 20, 21. The material is marl. Height, 2.6 cm. The round form of the skull, a high neck, and a flattened muzzle can be made out on this fragment (Efimenko 1958:394, Fig. 184:2). Animal Head No. 7 . Found in 1934 in Square K-27. Made of marl. Length, 2.5 cm. It has a round form. The muzzle is rather short and looks as though it is raised slightly upwards (Efimenko 1958:394). Two Fragments of Heads, Nos. 8 and 9. Found in 1934 in Square 1-24. The material is marl. One of these represents a head fragment similar to the pre- vious one. The second fragment is of an indeter- minate nature (Efimenko 1958:394). Animal Head No. 10 (PI. XVI:17, Coll. IE, 6223/140). Found in 1934 in Square 1-24. Made of marl. Length, 3.6 cm. The erect ears are noticeable as well as the pointed nose which looks as though it is stretching upwards. Judging by the way it is made, this head is undoubtedly the portrayal of an animal, but it is difficult to determine the species (Efimenko 1958: 394, Fig. 184:3). PORTRAYALS OF BIRDS. There are no complete figurines of birds from Kostenki I, but there are a number of heads made of marl which, in most in- stances, represent various kinds of birds. There are eleven such heads, but some of them are problemati- cal. Head of Bird, No. 1 (Coll. IE, 6223/150). Found in 1931 in Square L-10. The material is marl. Length, 3.3 cm. The preservation is poor. The head is weathered and is somewhat damaged as well. There is a straight, short beak and a comb. The break can be observed on the neck (Efimenko 1958:399). Head of Bird, No. 2(P1. XII: 8, Coll. IE, 6223/150). Found in 1933 in Square Q-ll. The material is marl. Length, 2 cm. This small head has a wide, slightly curved beak, typically duck-like, with a well de- fined groove down its center. On the right side the eye is indicated by means of a punctate. The neck has been broken off (Efimenko 1958:399, Fig. 190:1). Head of Bird, No. 3 (PI. XII: 12, Coll. IE, 6223/151). Found in 1936 in Square K-29. Made of marl. Length, 3.1 cm. This rather small head is quite generalized, and it has a sharp beak and thick neck. The top of the head and base of the neck are slightly damaged (Efimenko 1958:399, Fig. 189:2). Head of Bird, No. 4 (PI. XII: 11, Coll. IE, 6223/152). Found in Square M-24. Made of marl. Length, 3.1 cm. Analogous to the previous head. It has a short, conical beak, a rather long neck, and a little crest. Traces of wide carving marks from the processing can be seen on the surface (Efimenko 1958:400, Fig. 189:4). Head of Bird, No. 5. Found in 1934 in Square F-13. Made of marl. Length, 2 cm. This is a fragment of a very small curved head, and it is similar to the two previous ones (Efimenko 1958:400).</page><page sequence="22">22 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 Head of Bird, No. 6 (PI. XII:9, Coll. IE, 6223/153). Found in 1931 in Square G-10. Made of marl. Length, 2.8 cm. This head is very schematic and is triangu- lar in form. The elongated neck looks as though it had been lopped off (Efimenko 1958:400, Fig. 189: 1). Head of Bird, No. 7 (PI. XII: 10, Coll. IE, 6223/154). Found in 1934 in Squares H-21, 22. The material is marl. Length, 2.4 cm. This head is also triangular in outline with a sharp elongated beak. Its base is flat, and the head shows evidence of having been carefully finished (Efimenko 1958:401, Fig. 189:3). Head of Bird, No. 8 (PI. XII: 13, Coll. IE, 6223/158). Found in 1934 in Square L-21. Made of marl. Height, 2 cm.; width, 1.8 cm. This head is small and round, and by its general contours resembles that of a baby chick. The crown is flat, and the neck has been broken off. The little beak is typical. A small eye, in the form of a punctate, is barely visible on the right side. Both the beak and the area adjacent to it on the head show the narrow facets of the carving marks (Efimenko 1958:401, Fig. 190:2). Three Fragments of Bird's Heads, Nos. 9 through 11 (Coll. IE, 6223/155-157). All three are made of marl, having similar spherical outlines and a large circular pit on their somewhat flattened sides. No. 9 was found in 1934 in Square A- 16 and has a length of 2.8 cm. This fragment represents the back of a round head on which is depicted a short crest. No. 10 was found in 1936 in Square D-27. Its length is 2.5 cm. It is similar to the previous fragment, but on its base there is that triangular depression which is peculiar to the skull of birds (PI. XII: 15). No. 11 was found in 1936 in Square E-30. Its length is 3 cm. It is analogous to the previous examples in- asmuch as there are round pits on the sides and a triangular line at the base (PI. XII: 14) (Efimenko 1958:401, Fig. 190:3, 4). A PORTRAYAL OF A TOAD. Among the marl ob- jects found at Kostenki I there is one head which Efimenko thinks resembles that of a toad (PI. XII: 16, Coll. IE, 6223/133). It was found in 1934 in Squares 1-25, 26 and is made of marl with a length of 2.8 cm. The preservation is poor and it was evidently dam- aged in ancient times. It has a sharp muzzle, a triangular nose, and the eyes, which are located close together, have been portrayed in relief on both sides. According to Efimenko the relief of the sur- face on this head suggests the rough texture of the toad's skin. The entire representation is very life- like (Efimenko 1958:394, Fig. 184:4). UNDETERMINED SCULPTURED OBJECTS. The following group of works from Kostenki I consist of sculptured objects, the purpose of which is unknown. Two Objects, Ovoid in Form, With Pointed Ends (PI. XV:7 and XVIII: 6, Coll. IE, 6218/1576 and 4464/ 3). One of these was found standing upright with its sharp end driven into the floor of Square K-18. The other one was discovered in a storage pit (No. 12) together with a female figurine and other artifacts. The first one is well preserved having a length of 12.7 cm. and a diameter at the thickest part of 5.5 cm. It was carefully carved from mammoth ivory into a perfect egg-like shape. The lower end nar- rows and ends in a sharp point, while on the upper end there is a cylindrical neck which is decorated at the base by a relief band with transverse cuts. The second object is poorly preserved; its length is 8.2 cm. (Efimenko 1958:302, Fig. 112:1, PI. XIII:5). Plaque of Zoomorphic Form (Pis. XIV: 13 and XV:8, Coll. IE, 6218/1559). This is a thin plate of mam- moth ivory, the contours of which resemble a con- ventionalized, stylized representation of the muzzle of an animal en face. One can distinguish the out- line of a triangular head with its long muzzle and small, round ears sticking out at an angle. The facial side has been carefully smoothed down and it is bordered by a design of oblique crosses along the edge. The lower end has been broken off; its height is 3.1 cm.; width, 2.5 cm. (Efimenko 1958: 321, Fig. 124:1, PI. XIII: 1). Tops or Figured Heads of Bone Spatulas of Zoo- morphic Form (PI. XIV: 18, Coll. IE, 6051/6). The first spatula is provided with a flat figured head of semi-circular form. It is decorated with two pairs of oval cuts symmetrically arranged on each side. The upper pair is cut through and forms paired, small eyes which probably served for the passage of a thin thong. Along the edge of the head and the adjoining part of the spatula is an ornament of short notches (Efimenko 1958:303-305, Fig. 113:3). The handle of the second spatula terminates in a top which has a thin rounded scutiform shape. On either side there are pairs of oblique, rather deep cuts, giving a certain similarity with a fish's tail; the edges of thè handle are marked with a thin cut (PI. XIV: 16; see Efimenko 1958:305, Fig. 113:2). The third spatula ends in a heart-shaped head. One side is decorated with pairs of fairly deep cuts, while the reverse side is ornamented in the usual manner by notching along the edges (PI. XIV: 19, Coll. IE, 6051/8; see Efimenko 1958:305-306, Fig. 114). The rounded head of the fourth spatula has four obliquely placed perforations and the usual small notches along the edge of one side (PI. XIV: 15, Coll. IE, 6051/7; see Efimenko 1958:306, Fig. 115). The fifth spatula has a heart-shaped head with a somewhat pointed tip; there are two oval pits on one side of the head (PI. XIV: 17, Coll. IE, 6051/ 9; see Efimenko 1958:307, Fig. 116). ORNAMENTS. An unusual group of objects from Kostenki I consists of ornaments. Fragments of Diadems or Head Bands. The end</page><page sequence="23">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U .S .S .R. 23 of a head band was found in Squares L, M-23, 24 (Pis. XI: 13 and XVIII: 4, Coll. IE, 6218/1553). The material is mammoth ivory. Length, 5 cm.; width, 1.5 cm. It is a fragment in the form of a thin curved plate. On its tapered, rounded end there is a cir- cular opening for lacing (Efimenko 1958:322, Fig. 124:14). In these same squares an evidently similar frag- ment of the middle part of a head band was found made of a thin, curved, narrow plate of mammoth ivory. Length, 4.5 cm.; width, 1.1 cm (PI. XVIII: 10; see Efimenko 1958:322, Fig. 124:5). In Square K-15 there was found a fragment of the middle part of a narrow head band made of mam- moth ivory decorated along the edge of one side by fine notching. Length, 7 cm.; width, 1.4 cm. to 1.6 cm. (PI. XVIII: 5; see Efimenko 1958:322, Fig. 124:13). There are still three more, rather small fragments consisting of thin narrow plates of mammoth ivory and decorated along the edge by slanting crosses (PI. XVIII: 2; see Efimenko 1958:322, Fig. 124:8). Two other articles made of mammoth ivory are similar to the previous broken end pieces of head bands, but differ from them inasmuch as they are considerably thicker and more massive. They taper down toward their rounded ends, each of which has an opening cut through of irregular form; the place of the fracture has been smoothed, and there is a possibility that they may have served as pendants. One of them is 4.3 cm. long, 1.5 cm. wide, and 0.4 cm. thick. It is decorated along the edges of one side with crosses, and on the reverse side with three transverse lines (PI. XVIII: 12, Coll. IE, 6218/ 1554; see Efimenko 1958:321-322, Fig. 124:15). The other one has smaller dimensions and is deco- rated along one edge with a row of oblique crosses, and along the line of the fracture by notches (PL XVIII: 8, Coll. IE, 6218/1555; see Efimenko 1958:322, Fig. 124:11). STONE PENDANTS . A very common and widespread type of adornment at Kostenki I were large pendants made of marl. A great number of fragments of these ornaments were found in addition to some whole specimens. One of the latter (No. 1) was found in 1923 (PI. XIII: 10). Its form is characteristic for other pendants of this type - an oval ring, wide, heavy and massive at the base, and thin but narrow in the upper part where the rather small, round open- ing, which penetrates all the way through, is lo- cated. Diameter, 4.5 cm. (Efimenko 1958:334, Fig. 128). Pendant No. 2 (Pis. X:13 and XIII: 14, Coll. IE, 6223/ 178). No less typical are two fully finished pen- dants from Square E-16. Pendant No. 2 is large and massive and rounded in form, being almost flat on one side and convex on the other. Length, 5.6 cm.; height, 5 cm. In the center of an asymmetrically placed, rather deep round hole, there is an opening which penetrates all the way through (Efimenko 1958:335, Fig. 129, PI. XIII:4). Pendant No. 3 (Pis. X:12 and XIII: 13, Coll. IE, 6223/ 185). Length, 4.8 cm.; height, 3.8 cm. This pendant has smaller dimensions than the previous ones, and has a sub-triangular form with rounded corners. The opening is placed close to the very thin upper part (the base of the inverted triangle) (Efimenko 1958: 335, Fig. 130). Pendant No. 4 (PI. XIII: 12, Coll. IE, 6223/179). This is obviously part of a very large, massive pen- dant which was broken along the line of its opening. It bears traces of secondary retouching, and at the time this was done a new opening was made next to the old one (Efimenko 1958:335-336, Fig. 131). Judging by the numerous fragments of pendants it is possible to conclude that the common form, a ring with a thickened base, was predominant. More rarely one encounters pendants with a straightened upper part. Along with the specimens of large pen- dants there were smaller ones (2-3 cm.). All of the specimens were prepared by the same method: A hole was cut out on both sides of the upper part of the blank until a through opening was achieved in the center. Efimenko has made the observation that these articles can be called pendants only on the supposition that they must have been hung on some kind of a cord and worn as personal adornments. In the eyes of their owners they undoubtedly had a definite meaning, and they were most likely regarded as amulets. Their form finds its closest analogy in the semi-circular medallions made of marl. For this reason one may assume that such pendants are the same as medallions, but adapted for suspension. The perforation replaced the oval pit in the upper part of the semi-circular medallion. The correctness of this assumption is attested for Kostenki I by the objects of marl in which features of both the medal- lion and the pendant are combined. Pendant No. 5 is an especially good example of this type (PI. XIII: 11, Coll. IE, 6223/181). It was found in Squares H- 21, 22. The obverse side is flat with a carefully smoothed surface, while the reverse side is rounded and very convex. On the upper part there is the characteristic oval perforation cut through vertically. A portion of the upper cross-piece (bridge) has been broken, however. The width of this pendant is 4 cm. (Efimenko 1958:337, Fig. 132). Pendant No. 6 . This pendant is also of interest. It was found in a molehill (krotovina) in 1936, and in shape it resembles a medallion, but at the same time it has a perforation (Efimenko 1958:33 7). In the second complex of the upper level at Kostenki I, which Rogachev has partially investi- gated, mention has been made of the presence of marl pendants having the characteristic asymmetri-</page><page sequence="24">24 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 cal form (Rogachev 1957:26, Fig. 7:11). Kostenki I has also yielded a miniature bone pendant (length, l.Z cm.) with a small, round per- foration for threading a fine cord. In Efimenko' s opinion it is a reproduction in smaller dimensions of a wide spread type of hunting amulet, the atro- phied canine of the deer (PI. XVIII: 7; see Efimenko 1958:322, Fig. 124:4). A large group of ornaments from Kostenki I consisted of the canines of the polar fox or pos- sibly in some instances, of the common fox. The opening is in the root, but instead of being drilled through, as is the case in most Palaeolithic sites, the openings here have been cut through (Efimenko 1958:340-341, Fig. 138). Flat pebbles of natural origin have been found at Kostenki I, but evidently the openings on them were not made by human agency, nor was the shape of the pebble (Efimenko 1958:338-339, Figs. 133- 135), and fossilized shells without traces of per- forations on them have also been found at this site (Efimenko 1958:339-340, Fig. 136). Because Efi- menko has written about the definite role they played in the life of ancient man, we will not dwell at length on them here. ENGRAVINGS. We will now turn to the subject of the art, of engraving which, in contrast to the varied and carefully executed sculpturing, was consider- ably less developed here except for the portrayals of women on slabs of marl. Engraved representa- tional drawings are almost unknown. There are five portrayals, but they are of such a vague nature that we are unable to give an accurate identification. On a fragment of an animal's rib (length, 19.8 cm.) found in Square A-16 there was engraved what Efimenko believes to be the portrayal of a musk-ox (PI. XIV: 14, Coll. IE, 6218/1625). He perceives in this drawing the characteristic features of that ani- mal: a lowered head, round eyes, a shaggy, mas- sive body with a humped back and long tail, and the thick, trailing, wooly hair concealing the out- lines of the legs (Efimenko 1958:408, Fig. 200). On another fragment of rib (length, 24 cm.) found in Square Q-12, one can observe three bow- shaped lines from which a pencil of parallel rays issues forth on its left side (Coll. IE, 6218/1624; see Efimenko 1958:408). On a flat piece of a long bone (length, 14.5 cm.) found in Square M-24, some rather deeply carved lines form a vague portrayal which Efimenko (1958: 408) thinks represents the silhouette of some kind of an animal (Coll. IE, 6218/1578). A nondescript portrayal formed by a band of parallel and intersecting lines can be observed on another piece of flat bone (length, 14.5 cm.) that was found in pit house B [Russian letter] (Efimenko 1958:408-409). A fragment of a thin plate of mammoth ivory has traces of a portrayal of a vague nature on it executed by means of fine graving. This was found in Square O-ll (Efimenko 1958:409). Ornamental motifs at Kostenki I were a little more developed, but still they were simple, and not too many examples were found. They consisted of the most rudimentary geom ^tric elements arranged either in one row along the edge of the artifact, or in the form of parallel bands. In all likelihood, the simplicity of these ornamental motifs was one of the main reasons that Efimenko did not allot a spe- cial section to them in his monograph, but instead made mention of them only when describing the arti- facts. Ornamental designs occurred chiefly on those objects which unquestionably had a practical pur- pose: chopping and splitting tools such as adze- like axes, picks, mattocks, chisels, large wedges, spatulas, polishers, points, punches, awls, and needles. One rarely finds ornamentation on works of art, such as female figurines and decorated plates of bone. We will now consider the elements of ornament beginning with the most simple. 1. Fine cuttings consisting of tiny parallel trans- verse lines. They occur mainly along the edges of the long bone spatulas, the figured heads of which we have already described. 2. Parallel cuts of considerable length transversely arranged on the object. They can be observed on large curved shafts of mammoth ivory (Efimenko 1958: 301, Fig. 110:3). 3. Small evenly made oblique crosses found on the edges of spatulas and on a fragment of a needle. 4. Small cogs made by thin engraved lines found along the edges of spatulas or double rows of cogs inverted so that the sharp ends face one another forming ornamental bands across the spatula. On Figurine Fragment No. 24 there are two rows of cogs with the points facing inside and arranged in al- ternating order forming an ornamental band. 5. Ornamental parallel bands, each one formed by a double line made from small wedge shaped cuts. They can be seen on the butt end of a large chisel- like tool which was found in Square A-25 (PI. XVIII: 15, Coll. IE, 6051/5). A sort of zig-zag design which has been almost obliterated can be made out in the intervening spaces between these bands. Traces of this same design are also observed close to the working end of this tool (Efimenko 1958:294, Fig. 108). 6. Rows of herring bone design forming zig-zag- like lines. This type of design manifests itself particularly well on the butt of a large chisel-like tool found in pit house A in Square Q-10 (PI. XVIII: 14, Coll. IE, 6051/4; see Efimenko 1958:296, Fig. 109). 7. Zig-zags made of double lines. Found on a frag-</page><page sequence="25">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 25 ment of a thin plate of mammoth ivory (Pis. XV: 9 and XVIII: 9; see Efimenko 1958:322, Fig. 124:2). 8. A relief ornament of rectangles of parallel bands divided by a transverse cut observed on a fragment of a thin plate of mammoth ivory (PI. XVIII: 1 , Coll. IE, 6218/1605; see Efimenko 1958:321, Fig. 124:9). A similar ornament but done in less relief can be seen on a pick made of mammoth ivory found in Square E-16 (PI. XVIII: 13; see Efimenko 1958:292, Fig. 106), and also on a piece of a shaft of ivory (PI. XVIII: 3; see Efimenko 1958:317, Fig. 123:4). 9. Ornamental bands of rows of small semi-circles joined together. Found on female figurines. 10. Parallel rows of little crescent shaped cuts applied on the head of Female Figurine No. 51. Kostenki I, Third Level The third cultural layer at the Kostenki I Site lay in the middle part of a loess -like loam at a depth of 2.2 to 2.6 m. from the surface. The bone objects here are for the most part poorly preserved. Among them was noted a flat bead made of mammoth ivory quadrangular in shape with rounded corners and sharp edges, a round object of mammoth ivory, and also fragments of various artifacts with designs formed by circular parallel bands. Among the orna- ments of natural origin were found two perforated canines of the polar fox, shells (Neritina and Cerithium) with pierced perforations. In addition to these there were found tubular bones of a small animal, probably the polar fox. The epiphyses had been trimmed off (Rogachev 1957). 2. Aleksandrovka (Kostenki IV) This settlement is located at the mouth of the Aleksandrovka Ravine in the village of Kostenki, on the edge of a rather low terrace of the Don River. During the 1937-1938 excavations Rogachev dis- covered here the remains of two large dwellings placed almost parallel to each other having a length of 34 and 24 m. , and a width of 5-6 m. The remains of small round depressions having a distinctive hearth in the center were discernible in the middle of the western side in the southern end of one of these long dwellings. They are referred to as the round dwellings. The inventories of these different types of living areas show substantial differences (Rogachev 1955). ROUND DWELLINGS. Figurines of the usual type have not been found here, but there are two sculp- tures which Rogachev thinks may possibly be re- garded as anthropomorphic portrayals. One of them is especially well made and decorated, and it has large dimensions: length, 28 cm.; width, 4.5 cm.; thickness, 2 cm. (PI. XIX: 1, Coll. IE, 6194/1991). It represents an elongated figure somewhat flattened and oval in section. One end has been separated from the main part by means of a deep round groove, thus forming a tall (4.5 cm.) head. This groove was crudely cut. The top of the head was lopped off by a wide blow while the opposite (lower) end has been smoothed over and rounded out. The facial side is almost entirely covered by even rows of small punc- tates of different, often round and sub-triangular form. The pits are best preserved in the middle part where there are also two areas without any design whatsoever. These punctates can barely be made out on the ends of this object because they have been worn smooth. On the back in the lower part there is a design made up of transverse bands formed by six rows of punctates (Rogachev 1955:84, PI. XXVIII: 1). The second object differs from the previous one by its smaller dimensions and absence of decoration (PI. XIX: 2, Coll. IE, 6194/1992). Length, 23 cm.; width, 6.5 cm.; thickness, 2 cm. It is shaped like a drawn out oval and has a lenticular section because the edge of the rib was sharpened rather than rounded out. The object tapers down toward the upper part, then is separated from the main body by a round groove which was made by rather slipshod facets. The upper part of the head was also broken off by a sharp blow. The facial side is smoothed and there are no visible traces of ornament (Rogachev 1955: 84, 88, PI. XXVIII: 2). Two fragments were also found and apparently belong to the two above-mentioned objects since the similarity of the design is retained in the form of rows of punctates (PI. XIX: 3, 4, Coll. IE, 6194/ 1993; see Rogachev 1955, PI. XXVII: 3, 6). Rogachev believes that the general appearance of these works - the clearly formed heads and the design which covers the smooth surface - does not allow one to classify them as objects with a utili- tarian purpose. The wide distribution of sculptured female figurines during the Upper Palaeolithic also attests to the same thing - that these artifacts from Kostenki IV are stylized female figurines (Rogachev 1955:88). FIGURINES OF ANIMALS. The characteristic sculptures from the round dwellings at Kostenki IV were made of marl, and there are figurines of mam- moth, bison and other animals which are difficult to identify. There are ten figurines which may be regarded as portrayals of mammoths and blanks for the same. We will consider first of all an object of marl which Rogachev regards as anthropomorphic (PI. XX: 1, Coll. IE, 6194/1925; see Rogachev 1955:77,</page><page sequence="26">26 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 PI. XXII: 6). The material is yellowish marl of good quality. Length, 3.2 cm.; height, 3 cm.; thickness, 2.5 cm. Found in the western dwelling. It is an unfinished figurine, put together from many pieces. Only the front part and the base have been proc- essed: the remaining surface is unworked. The trunk, wide at the top and tapering off below, is clearly indicated in the front, and the adjoining sur- face to the right has been smoothed down. The left side of the object is flattened with facets; the right side, on the contrary, is convex. The finishing is still intact on the base where a smoothed out de- pression gradually changes over to a flat surface. The clearly marked trunk with its tapered end does not leave any doubt that this figurine portrays a mammoth which for some reason was not completely finished. There are two figurines of the mammoth which are close to the type of figurine found at Kostenki I, one of them being totally similar to mammoth figu- rine No. 6. It is a large figurine, and was found in a pit in Square 111-40 (PI. XX:2, Coll. IE, 6194/1923). Length, 4.8 cm.; height, 3.7 cm.; thickness, 1.4 cm. It is made of grayish yellow marl and is poorly pre- served. The surface is weathered and covered over by a dark residue. Just as in Kostenki I, this mam- moth has been represented only in very general out- line. The left side is well preserved. The rather small round head is clearly separated from the body, but the trunk is not set off from the foreparts. The right side and hindquarters have been damaged by wide chip marks, the only part left intact being the upper part of the head and the adjoining portion of the back. The base was smoothed out to form an oval. The second figurine is of an animal, general- ized and schematic, of a type very similar to the figurines of standing mammoths from Kostenki I (PI. XX:5, Coll. IE, 6194/1915). Found in Square N- 42. Made of yellowish, weathered marl. Length, 2.6 cm.; height, 1.5 cm.; thickness, 1.4 cm. The trunk is clearly indicated on the right side, hanging straight down, but standing out by itself at the very bottom; the characteristic hump on the back is well designated. There are no details on the left side. The hindquarters are round and have been smoothed out, but the base was left unprocessed; it has a wide depression in the center of it. There are two other figurines of a type close to the portrayal of a seated mammoth from Anosovka II. The first one is represented by a fragment which was found in a pit in Squares 111-38, 39 (PI. XX:4, Coll. IE, 6194/1914). The material is gray marl. Some areas on the processed surface have dark burns. The entire figurine was very large since the dimensions of the fragment are: length, 4.7 cm.; height, 3 cm.; width, 2.9 cm. In longitudinal sec- tion it is almost oval. The base was damaged by a deep cavity, the remainder being left unworked. The upper part of the figurine has also been damaged, the head having been almost entirely broken off with the exception of its right side and the end of the trunk. Despite the considerably larger dimensions, this figurine is very similar in treatment to the one from Anosovka II. The second figurine is conventionalized but similar to the figurines of seated mammoths from Anosovka II (PI. XX:6, Coll. IE, 6194/1916). It was discovered in Square 111-39. The material is grayish yellow marl of good quality. Length, 3 cm.; height, 2 cm.; width, 1.2 cm. The figurine is smoothed with rounded outlines and has in its upper forepart a trunk which is distinctly articulated on the right side. The base of the object is flattened and bevelled, and along the right side runs a large facet. Five other figurines from Kostenki IV may be re- garded as either blanks or uncompleted figurines, in all probability of the mammoth. A fragment of an animal figurine was found in Square R-42 (PI. XX: 13, Coll. IE, 6 194/1921). It is made of yellowish gray marl. Length, 2.8 cm.; height, 1.7 cm.; thickness, 1.4 cm. Apparently this is a fragment of a mammoth figurine of which only the right side and part of the rear end have been preserved. The left side and front part were damaged by chipping, and the base, which was broken off horizontally, was not smoothed. In the center of the hindquarters there is a projection most likely intended to portray the tail. In Square P-38 a blank of an animal figurine was discovered (PI. XX: 10, Coll. IE, 6194/1920). The ma- terial is yellowish gray marl with pinkish overtones. Length, 3.5 cm.; height, 1.5 cm.; thickness, 0.9 cm. This figurine is flattened. The back has the char- acteristic hump, but it is somewhat small and the little tail is indicated on the hindquarters. The fore part on the left side has been damaged. The right side is without detail. A triangular hollow below the tail is possibly meant to show that the legs are separated. The base is cut very evenly. With the exception of the damaged areas, this figurine was carefully finished and smoothed. Possibly it was completed, although only in a generalized manner. In Square R-40 a blank of an animal figurine was found which most likely represents a standing mammoth (PI. XX:8, Coll. 6194/1919). The material is a yellowish marl with pinkish overtones and is of good quality. Length, 3 cm.; height, 1.7 cm.; thickness, 1 cm. This figurine is flattened and par- tially shaped. Its general outlines are such that it can be included in this series. The base has been damaged by a wide, uneven facet. A blank for an animal figurine was found in the eastern dwelling. It is made of grayish yellow marl and is in a poor state of preservation (PI. XX: 14, Coll. IE, 6194/1917). Length, 3.5 cm.; height, 2 cm.; thickness, 1.7 cm. This figurine is very schematic.</page><page sequence="27">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 27 The characteristic hump of the back, is very easily made out, the head and trunk have been marred by a wide facet, and the base is also broken. The hind- quarters are portrayed in the form of a rounded cone. Another blank for an animal figurine was dis- covered in Square S-41. By its appearance it is similar to specimens from Kostenki I (Coll. IE, 6194/ 1960). It is made of marl and was reconstructed from three pieces. Length, 4.5 cm.; height, 3 cm.; thickness, Z.4 cm. The prominent uneven line of the back is very characteristic, but the front and hind- quarters have been knocked off. If viewed from above the small tail can be perceived to one side. The base has been slightly flattened by a concave facet. Certain figurines from Kostenki IV are more reminiscent of the bison than of any other kind of animal. The most characteristic figurine of this type was found in the western round dwelling in Square R-40 (Pis. XX: 3 and XXI: 1, Coll. IE, 6194/ 1918). The material is marl. Length, 3.5 cm.; height, 2.4 cm.; thickness, 1.3 cm. A high prominent hump descends abruptly backwards. The small flat head seems topped with horns. The base is flat and even. The figurine has been damaged by wide flat facets both in the front on the right side and in the back on the left side (Rogachev 1955:77, Fig. 28:2). The second figurine is similar but more sche- matic (PI. XX: 12, Coll. IE, 6194/1913). It was found in the same dwelling in Square TS-39 [Russian let- ter]. The material is marl. Length, 3.2 cm.; height, 2 cm.; thickness, 1.3 cm. One may discern the small head which has been reproduced in general outline, and the pronounced rise of the hump in the fore part with its abrupt descent to the rear. On the lower left hand side there is a depression as if separating the hind legs. The right side has been evenly smoothed. The lower part of the figurine was left unfinished, but is cut rather evenly so that the figurine can stand. The generalization of the out- line does not allow one to precisely determine the species of animal, but the slope of the head plus the general expressiveness of this figurine lead one to assume that this is a portrayal of a bison (Roga- chev 1955:77, PI. XXII:3). The third figurine was found in the same dwell- ing as the two previous ones. This was found in Square N-42 (PI. XX:9, Coll. IE, 6194/1922). The material is gray, ashen colored marl. Length, 2.7 cm.; height, 1.6 cm.; thickness, 1 cm. On this figurine one may discern a protuberant hump, a for- ward pitched, triangular, flattened head, and the front and hind legs which form a cone. Alone with the figurines of the mammoth and bison other objects, zoomorphic in form, were found. An example is the curious object from Kostenki IV that was discovered among other works of marl (PI. XX: 11, Coll. IE, 6194/1931). It has the shape of an irregular flattened cone. The base was made on a slant. On its wide apex are three deep gashes on one side, two on the other. This may represent the paw of a carnivore, most likely that of a bear. A head found in the western round dwelling un- doubtedly portrays that of an animal, but it is diffi- cult to establish the species (Pis. XX: 7 and XXI:2, Coll. IE, 6194/1912). It is made of marl, carefully smoothed, and processed by a technique similar to that found on the images at Kostenki I. It was re- constructed from many pieces. The dimensions are: length, 3 cm.; height, 3.5 cm.; the neck in section, 2.8 X 2.3 cm. Two pairs of protuberances on the upper part of the head are very well expressed - the back ones look as though they were broken off in- tentionally while the front ones are in the form of two carefully smoothed round bulges, possibly por- traying the eyes. The lower part of the muzzle has also been smoothed. The mouth is cut on an upward slant. There is a gash on the right side of the head across the neck. The latter is oval in section and was left unworked. According to Rogachev this head most of all recalls that of a ram. But if it is exam- ined from another angle it could just as well resemble the head of both a saiga and a horse. The difficulty of determining the species is further compromised by the fact that a wide gash has marred the upper front part of the head (Rogachev 1955:77, Fig. 28:1). There were a number of discoveries of undeter- mined objects made of marl. A similar article was found on the floor of a deep pit (No. 4 in the eastern dwelling) in an upright position. One is a shaft of mammoth ivory, poorly preserved (PI. XX: 20, Coll. IE, 6194/1996). The length is not less than 17 cm. The shaft widens out toward the top and terminates in a flat carved head in the center of which is a large round opening. The outer edge of this head is trimmec by widely spaced notches, the slightly convex facial side of the object which has been smoothed, is cov- ered by engraved thin straight lines. In form this article bears a resemblance to the so-called "baton de commandment ," but its gracefulness and fragility speak out against the fact that it could have been utilized as a shaft straightener of projectile weapons or as an instrument for stropping thongs. It is far more likely that this type of object could have been used as an ornament for the head, e.g., as a pin or hair pin (Rogachev 1955:84, PI. XXVII:2). The upper horizon at Kostenki IV yielded over thirty finished slate disks of lenticular form and having polished surfaces. All of them show traces of use attesting that they were employed as retouch- ers. One of these disks with a round opening which was bi-conically drilled shows no traces of having been used (PI. XXI:3, Coll. IE, 6194/1790; see Roga- chev 1955:63, PI. XI:2). In addition to these there are about ten pendants which, according to Rogachev1 s opinion, are shaped</page><page sequence="28">28 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 like spindle whorls, the greater portion of them being in fragments. The outward appearance of one of them recalls the before mentioned perforated slate disk, differing from it only by smaller dimensions. It was also found in the western round dwelling (Pis. XX:16 and XXI:4, Coll. IE, 6194/1791; see Rogachev 1955:77-78, PI. XXII: 1). There are two halves from different pendants, alike in size and shape, plus a fragment of a pendant in the form of a small segment. Judging by the walls it seems evident that the latter was chiseled out rather than drilled. They are narrow and distinguished by the irregularity of their edges. All of the above men- tioned, including the smaller piece, have carefully polished surfaces (Coll. IE, 6194/1966, 1972). Also found were about fifteen pieces of short marl shafts round and oval in section (PI. XX: 18). Their dimensions are not large: length, 1-2 cm.; thickness, 0.5-1.7 cm. Certain of them have rather pointed ends (Rogachev 1955:78, PI. XXII:2). An exception to this series is a crudely fashioned ob- ject with a rounded constricted waist in the center, and roughly rounded ends (PI. XX: 17, Coll. IE, 6194/ 1928). The length of this distinctive button is 4 cm., its thickness, 1.8 cm. (Rogachev 1955:78, PI. XXII:4). ORNAMENTS. To begin with, there is a pendant made from a tubular bone in imitation of an atro- phied canine of a deer with an opening cut through the root; the upper part of the root has been broken at the perforation ( PI. XX:15, Coll. IE, 6194/1997; see Rogachev 1955:84, PI. XXVII:4). Besides this, there are miniature fastenings (toggles) or beads made of bone - 41 whole and 91 fragments. They are small, round in section, with rounded constricted waists in the center which serve for attachment (PI. XX: 19, Coll. IE, 6194/20 74). Length, 4-5 cm.; diameter, 2 mm. and less (Roga- chev 1955:84, PI. XXVII: 1). ENGRAVINGS AND ORNAMENTS. Four pieces of marl have traces of engravings. One of these repre- sents a fairly small fragment of a slab of marl, the rosy gray color of which was evidently caused by tinting with ochre (PI. XIX:6, Coll. IE, 6194/1926). The surfaces of both sides have been smoothed and on one side a figure has been carved out by deep uneven lines in the shape of an equilateral triangle. Its dimensions are: 4.2 X 2.5 X 1 cm. (Rogachev 1955:78, PI. XXII:5). The second fragment is from a thicker slab of marl which is quadrangular in sec- tion (PI. XIX: 5, Coll. IE, 6194/192 7). On one of its flat surfaces there are some deep jagged lines, and although they are arranged without order, they nevertheless all go in one direction. The dimensions of this fragment are: 4.4 X 3 X 2 cm. (Rogachev 1955:78, PI. XXII: 7). There are two additional frag- ments, each bearing traces of some kind of unclear silhouette portrayals. Regarding decoration represented in the upper horizon at Kostenki IV, it is simple and few in num- ber, amounting to short transverse cuts on the edges of artifacts (a polisher and undetermined objects such as the head ornament), and parallel rows of small punctates of irregular shapes, sometimes be- ing almost triangular in form (as seen on a large anthropomorphic artifact and on fragments). On one of these fragments, longitudinal and transverse rows of punctates form a figure of geometric outlines (Rogachev 1955, PI. XXVII:6). In just the same way, regular rows form rec- tangular outlines on one of the anthropomorphic artifacts (Rogachev 19 55: PI. XXVIII:!). LONG HOUSES. The lower horizon of Kostenki is totally devoid of any marl artifacts, nor are there works of art made of bone in spite of the large quan- tities of bone tools such as polishers and awls. The presence of ornaments is worthy of note. They consisted of drilled canine teeth of the polar fox and wolf, and shells of the freshwater mollusks, Neritina and Paludina (Pis. XXI: 5 and XXII:6-11, Coll. IE, 6194/2065-2066, 2095-2098, etc.; see Rogachev 19 55:148, 150, 151, PI. XLVIII:4-9 and Fig. 40). Among these ornaments there is only one pendant made of tubular bone which is reminiscent in form to an atrophied canine of a deer with a per- foration (PI. XXII: 5, Coll. IE, 6194/2068; see Roga- chev 1955:151, PI. XLVIII:3). 3. Anosovka II This settlement is located on a slope of the central promontory of the Anosova Ravine. During the investigation of this site in 1956, Rogachev ascertained the existence of four Upper Palaeolithic levels. The second level was in a brown, loess- like loam in the form of a lens which had evidently been darkened by humus. This lens has a thickness of 20 cm. and an area 10 X 8 m. Along with a great quantity of flint articles there was also discovered a whole series of marl objects consisting mainly of figurines of mammoth and rhinoceros and figurines of hemispherical form with a carefully smoothed base (PI. XXIII). Altogether there were about fifteen mammoth figurines plus several blanks. All were made of grayish marl, and they are quite poorly pre- served, often covered with a limey accumulation. The common denominator for all of these figurines appears to be the generalization of the reproduction of the mammoth's massive body, but nevertheless, these figurines leave no doubt as to their specific identification. All of the bases were horizontally cut, thoroughly smoothed, and have either egg shaped</page><page sequence="29">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 29 or oval form. The hemispherically shaped body of the animal with a head rises from the base, and often a short small trunk looks as if it is curled under. The head is sometimes separated from the body by a carved groove. There are no other de- tails, and, indeed, they are not even needed since even the most schematic figurine represents the characteristic outline of the mammoth, seemingly squatting on its hind legs. Four marl figurines of the rhinoceros, similar in type, are very expressive. Their dimensions are fairly small. One of them is preserved in full, the second one has been broken on top, and only the fore parts remain from the other two. In spite of the generalized nature of the reproduction and the obviously schematic lines, the contours of these portrayals allow one to perceive the powerful form of the rhinoceros and the forward thrust of the horn on its bowed head. This site also yielded two bone awls, their handles depicting the head of some sort of carnivore, most likely a wolf or perhaps a dog. Mention should also be made of some marl sub- jects which look even more like spindle whorls than do the lenticular disks of Kostenki IV. One side is flat, the other convex, and there is a round opening in the center. There are upwards of some fifty sim- ilar objects without openings, all of the same form and of the same type, differing only in size. The purpose of these objects is a mystery. Also discovered were several fragments of bone on which were ornaments of transverse cuts, and the root portion of a wolf's canine with unequal transverse grooves (see appendix). 4. Kostenki II Kostenki II is situated on the left slope of Anosova Ravine. During the 1953 excavation under the direction of P. I. Boriskovskii, there was dis- covered in the cultural layer an oval-shaped ac- cumulation (7X8 m..). On the floor within this accumulation there were a few works of art: a sche- matic human figurine of bone and two decorated bone objects. Anthropomorphic Figurine (PI. XXII: 1). Length, 9.1 cm.; thickness, 0.9 cr This is an elongated, rounded shaft, the upper end of which has an oblique fracture. The fore part of the preserved head is separated from the body by a well defined groove. The undivided legs have been reproduced by means of a wide longitudinal cut in the lower part of the shaft. Despite the extreme conventionalization of this figurine, its general contours permit one to see it as a human representation. After noting the mark- ed difference between this figurine and other real- istic female portrayals of the Upper Palaeolithic, Boriskovskii suggests that it bears more of a resemb- lance to the type of figurine found at the Mezin and Petersfels sites (Boriskovskii 1956a: 188, Fig. 10:1). When one compares it with the latter, however, it is not difficult to see that its morphological features differ considerably from them, and that they really have a closer resemblance to certain shaft-like figurines from Mal'ta and Buret1. Bone Plaques. There are two elongated objects which are decorated with engraved ornament in the form of asymmetrical curved lines. In one case the ornament is arranged in the form of separate lines, and in the other case, in the form of two pencils (PI. XXII: 3, 4; see Boriskovskii 1956a:188, Fig. 10:2 and 3). Par- allel, longitudinal lines also decorate the handle of a small awl (PI. XXII: 2, Coll. Institute of Archaeology, Leningrad; see Boriskovskii 1956a: 188, Fig. 10:7). 5. Volkovskaia Site (Kostenki XII) This site is located on a promontory near the entrance to the Pokrovskii Ravine on its right bank. It is 300 m. from Kostenki I. One of the localities of the upper cultural level at this site (Locality B, Kostenki VII) yielded about ten bones with traces of cuts and use. Besides these there were numerous flint artifacts, a fragment of a bone needle with a broken eye, and the canine of a polar fox, or perhaps a common fox, perforated at the root (Rogachev 195 7: 69). 6. Markina Gora (Kostenki XIV) This settlement is situated on a sloping ravine formed by the confluence of the main channel of the Pokrovskii Ravine and its ancient branch, the Ermi- shinii Ravine. During the excavations of 1953-1954, Rogachev discovered only a few, but very interesting, works of art in the second cultural level at a depth of 3.6 m. from the surface. First of all there was an object in the form of an awl, the head of which ap- parently portrays the head of some kind of an animal, and its shaft is decorated with four rows of short transverse lines. It was made of bone. There were also two bone beads and the two fragments of thin polished bone objects, one of which had traces of a round hole on it, the other one having thin notches along its edges. Short, widely spaced transverse cuts appear on the surface of two fragments of thin tubular bone, and on one of the flat sides of a frag- ment of an animal's rib there are traces of rows of cuts which form either a zigzag or a herring bone (Rogachev 1957:81).</page><page sequence="30">30 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 7. Gorodtsovskaia Site (Kostenki XV) This site is located on the slope of a promontory near the entrance to the Alexandrovskii Ravine. In 1952 Rogachev discovered a child's interment here, and near the region of the skull, lying in an orderly array, were upwards of 159 perforated teeth of the polar fox (canines, incisors, molars). The cultural level at this site yielded nearly thirty assorted perforated teeth of the polar fox (Rogachev 1957: 111, 117). 8. Kostenki XVII Kostenki XVII is located in the Don Valley be- tween the Pokrovskii and Anosova Ravines. The site was discovered in 1953 and was excavated by Boriskovskii in 1955 (1956b). In the upper cultural level lying at a depth of 2.3 m. from the surface, there were found a large stone pendant with a wide opening of natural origin in it, a miniature ornament of mother-of-pearl, and a rather small clay fragment on which were two fairly deep parallel incisions. In the lower cultural level, lying at a depth of 6 m. from the surface, numerous ornaments, pen- dants, were discovered. Two of the stone pendants had openings that had been carefully drilled from each side, one of them was made from a flat slate pebble (Pis. XXI: 12 and XXII: 23), the other from a soft yellow stone, a type of sandstone (Pis. XXI: 13 and XXII: 17). A fragment of a third stone pendant was fashioned from gray slate (Pis. XXI: 14 and XXII: 18). Also found were five pendants made of belem- nite.* One of them, a whole belemnite, had rounded ends, the narrower and flattened end of which had an opening that had been drilled from two sides (Pis. XXI: 8 and XXII: 12); and four were made of belemnite fragments, their openings also having been drilled from two sides (Pis. XXI: 6, 7, 9, 10 and XXII: 13 -16). There were also nineteen fragments of belemnites, apparently blanks, since they had no openings on them. Pendants made of other types of fossil shells were also found (PI. XXII:19-22). In conclusion, mention should also be made of the 3 7 drilled canine teeth of the polar fox, the Belemnite is the internal shell of a cephalopod and belongs to the extinct family, Belemnitidae. It has a conical shape and is found as a calcareous fossil in rocks belonging to the Jurassic and Cretac- eous Periods. The shell is chambered, one side having a delicate concave blade. The external ap- pearance of the shell looks exactly like a long pointed missile. It is related to the Sepia family. ( - Trans.) majority of which had been preserved in their en- tirety (Boriskovskii 1956b). 9. Tel'manskaia This site is located on a sloping incline of the Aleksandrovskii Ravine in the village of Kostenki. The upper level was studied by Efimenko in 193 7. A round dwelling was discovered here, dug into the ground. It had a diameter of approximately 6 m. , with the remains of a hearth in the center. The works of art were few in number, consisting only of ornaments. Two pendants, made of mammoth ivory and having the shape of an irregular oval were found. They were fairly thick (0.7-1.2 cm.) with compara- tively wide openings which had been carved through from both sides (PI. XXIV:2, 3, Coll. IE, 5590; see Efimenko and Boriskovskii 1957:230, Fig. 19:11, 12). The third specimen was also oval in shape and al- though it had no opening, it may have been a blank for the same type of pendant. In the course of investigating the upper layer in 1949-1950, Rogachev found a pendant made of mammoth ivory, the lower end of which had been cut off and smoothed, but had been broken off at the eye opening (PI. XXIV: 1; see Rogachev 195 7:47). A flat rectangular fragment of bone with an open- ing on one end was also found in this same level (PI. XXIV:4; see Efimenko and Boriskovskii 1957:230, Fig. 19:10), and two quite small tubular bones, evenly and carefully trimmed off on both ends, thus being converted into short tubes. The surface of one of them was covered over entirely with decora- tion of carved longitudinal grooves (PI. XIV: 5, Coll. IE, 5590; see Efimenko and Boriskovskii 1957:230, Fig. 19:9). Mention should also be made of the three polar fox canines which had been drilled at the root (Efimenko and Boriskovskii 1957:230). The excavations of Rogachev in the second level (1957:56) resulted in the discovery of a rather small pendant made of mammoth ivory with a broken off eye, and having concentric transverse cuts. There was also a small fragment of a tubular bone of a small animal with four bands made by short trans- verse cuts. The tooth of a small carnivore, drilled at the root, was found in the third layer of this site (Roga- chev 1957:58). 10. Kel'sievskaia The Kel'sievskaia site is situated on the left slope of the Kozlov Ravine, a branch of the Pokrov- skii Ravine. Its cultural level was bedded under chernozem in a thin seam of brown loess -like loam at a depth of 1.6-1.8 m. from the surface. A piece</page><page sequence="31">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 31 of a round object made of mammoth ivory, possibly the head of a figurine (PI. XXII: 25), was unearthed during the 1958 excavation. The canine tooth of a polar fox with an opening cut through (PI. XXII: 26) was also discovered at this time in addition to an elongated bone shaft with notches along its sides in the form of short transverse cuts and small ob- lique crosses (PI. XXII:2 7; see Budzko I960). 11. Borshevo I Borshevo is located on the left slope of the Kuznetsov Ravine near the area where the latter opens out to the river. During the excavations in 1922, Zamiatnin found some ornaments: three very thin circles of mother-of-pearl with a diameter of 0.55-0.8 cm. and with centrally located openings of 0.15-0.2 cm in diameter (PI. XXIV: 11-13, Coll. IE, 4633; see Vekilova 1953:133, Fig. 14:v [Russian letter]) and a pendant made out of a horse incisor, drilled at the root (PI. XXIV: 10, Coll. IE, 4633). Next to the opening on one side was the beginning of another perforation (Vekilova 1953:133, Fig. 14:b^ [Russian letter]). 12. Borshevo II This settlement is located on the right bank of the Don River near the village of Borshevo. It was excavated by Efimenko and Boriskovskii. The works of art from this site are very few in number, and with the exception of some decorated mattocks, they have not as yet been published, and they are only partially mentioned. The lower horizon was far more interesting, bone artifacts frequently appear- ing and consisting mainly of rather small, thin, elongated plaques of mammoth ivory. The first one (PI. XXIV: 15, Coll. IE, 4635/1039) has been worked, rounded off on one end, and broken on the other. A decorative band made up of longi- tudinal lines from which depart tiny transverse lines goes part way along one of the long edges, and a second row of similar cuts can be made out in this area. The measurements of this plaque are: length, 7 cm.; width, 1.1 cm. The second plaque consists of a thin fragment of mammoth ivory, the surface of which has been smoothed. Its measurements are: length, 6 cm.; width, 1.4 cm. (Coll. IE, 4635/1040). The third plaque is also of mammoth ivory. There is a tiny transverse notch on its edge, and it is pointed on one end. Length, 9.9 cm.; width, 0.9 cm. (PI. XXIV: 16, Coll. IE, 4635/1049). The cuts on other bones have been arranged in an irregular fashion. On a rather small piece of an animal's bone, for example, three parallel cuts ap- pear on one end, while only two appear on the other (PI. XXIV: 18, Coll. IE, 4635/1041). The meas- urements of this fragment are: length, 3.8 cm.; width, 1.8 cm. There are numerous thin transverse cuts on both flat sides of a fragment of mammoth ivory, plus two deep longitudinal lines along the edge. Its length is 4.4 cm.; the width, 2.4 cm.; and the thickness, 1 cm. (PI. XXIV: 17, Coll. IE, 4635/1042). Two tools made of deer antler and bearing geo- metric designs on their surfaces command special attention. The first one consists of the end of a deer's antler; two-thirds of this slightly curved antler has been cut off obliquely on the outer con- vex side (PI. XXIV: 30). The end forms an even, care- fully sharpened cutting edge, either of a mattock or an adze. On the concave side of the upper part there are the remains of a net design in the form of small elongated rhombs longitudinally. The length of this tool is 15.5 cm., and its diameter is 3-3.5 cm. (Boriskovskii 1941:52-53, Pis. VIII and IX: 1). A second tool was also made from a segment of deer's antler (PI. XXIV:31). Length, 16.5 cm.; diam- eter, 2.5-3 cm. One end was cut from the concave inner side to the convex outer side in such a manner as to produce a slightly concave cutting edge. In the central area of the convex side of the tool there is also a decoration formed by an oblique net of elongated rhombs (Boriskovskii 1941:52-53, Pis. VIII and IX: 2). The middle horizon of this site yielded a small quadrangular piece of an artifact made of mammoth ivory (PI. XXIV:22, Coll. IE, 4635/1059). Its flat surfaces were smoothed. There is an engraved de- sign on the outer convex surface, made in such a way that the alternating triangles form a zigzag-like band between them. The length of this fragment is 2.4 cm.; the width, 1.3 cm. (Boriskovskii 1941:57, Coll. IE, 4635/1059). The presence of ornaments was noted during the exploration of the upper horizon: flat miniature circles of stone and bone with openings in the cen- ter with a diameter up to 1 cm. , and also perforated tubes of Dentalium shells, and the shells of marine mollusks (PI. XXIV:23-29; see Efimenko 1934:111; 1940:283). 13. Gagarino This settlement is located on the northern edge of the village of Gagarino, which in its turn is situated on the left bank on the upper reaches of the Don, about five km. north of its confluence with the Bystraia Sosna River. In 1927 and 1929, Zamiatnin uncovered, in an area of about 73 square meters, the remains of a fairly small round dwelling that measured 5.5 X 4.5 meters. Some distinctive fe- male figurines made of mammoth ivory and other art objects were found inside this dwelling.</page><page sequence="32">32 Arctic Anthropology IV -2 FEMALE FIGURINES. There was a total of three whole figurines and six fragments found at this site. Figurine No. 1 (Pis. XXV: 1 and XXVI: 1 , Coll. IE, 3555/1). Found in 1927 near the wall of the dwell- ing. Made of mammoth ivory. Height, 5.8 cm. Portrays a nude woman, almost intact except for the legs that were broken off long ago. Its propor- tions have been shortened as though to exaggerate its massive outlines. The head has an egg-like, rounded form, sits atop a thin neck, and is inclined forward in the usual manner. The face is not shaped and has been separated from the rest of the head by a clear line. Concentric rows of pits cover the entire surface of the head. The three lower rows have larger dimensions and are triangular in form, while the upper rows are like little punctates and look as though they were done by pricking. The narrow shoulders, enormous, loose-hanging, pear-shaped breasts, swollen abdomen, wide pelvis, and protruding part of the thighs are characteristic of the sculptures of this period. The proportionately thick arms, tightly pressed to the body, show up only down to the elbows , and from that point on they cannot be traced, and they look as though they blend in with the breasts; it is possible that they are either resting on top of the breasts or are sup- porting them from below. Only the upper part of the thighs have been preserved. The remainder of the legs on the back side are divided by a deep longi- tudinal line (Zamiatnin 1935:63-65, Fig. 22). Figurine No. 2 (Pis. XXV: 2 and XXVI: 2, Coll. IE, 3555/3). The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 5.5 cm. Found in 1927 inside the dwelling. This figurine has been preserved in its entirety with the exception of the lower part of the legs. It repre- sents the same type of a woman, naked and plump. The head is tilted forward and has a distinctive shape, possibly intended to represent a headdress or hair-do. A markedly convex fillet goes along the forehead, blending in with the head at the temples. As usual, the shoulders are narrow and sloping, the breasts are sagging, and the abdomen is swollen. The legs rendered almost in full, however, are re- alistically shown and very well shaped. The knees are tightly squeezed together, the rounded calves are separated. The arms have been treated in a totally unusual manner. They have been carefully formed, but are disproportionately thin. They are closely pressed to the body down as far as the el- bows, then turn upwards and rise to the level of the chin. A bit of the right arm has been broken off, but the left one is intact (Zamiatnin 1935:65, Fig. 23). Figurine No. 3 (Pis. XXV:4 and XXVI:4, Coll. IE, 3555/3). Found in 1927 inside the dwelling. Made of mammoth ivory. Height, 7.1 cm. Represents the figure of a nude woman, and, with the exception of the lower part of the legs, it has been preserved in its entirety. This figurine is totally different from the previous ones with regard to its physical type, expressed chiefly by its proportions. It is flat and extremely elongated in length. The head is small and inclined forward as usual. Narrow shoulders, sagging, low-placed breasts, elongated torso, swol- len abdomen, and projecting hips recall the previous figurines. But despite the large breasts and abdomen the woman depicted here is nevertheless tall and slim. The arms, tightly pressed to the body, can be traced only down to the elbows. Apparently the re- mainder of them must have been reposing on the abdomen. The legs are long, well proportioned, and graceful in outline. The thighs are divided by a deep line, and below the nicely shaped knees the legs are slightly parted (Zamiatnin 1935:65, 67, Fig. 24). Figurine No. 4 (PI. XXV:5, Coll. IE, 3555/6). Found in 1927 inside the dwelling. The material is mam- moth ivory. By its dimensions (height, 2.4 cm.) it is a miniature. This is a highly schematized female figurine, broken off at both ends. Only the breasts and prominent abdomen can be observed; other de- tails are lacking (Zamiatnin 1935:68, Fig. 25a). Figurine No. 5 (Pis. XXV: 3 and XXVI: 3, Coll. IE, 3555/4). Found in 1927 inside the dwelling. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 5.4 cm. It repre- sents a woman's figure. It was not completely fin- ished, and the top of the head has evidently been broken off. Especially noteworthy is the rounded protruding outlines of the abdomen and the flatter outline of the buttock area. The legs have been shaped, are squeezed tightly together, and bend for- ward. The figurine was not completed since it w^s broken, evidently during manufacture (Zamiatnin 1935:69, Fig. 23b [Russian letter]). Figurine No. 6 (Pis. XXV: 6 and XXVI: 5, Coll. IE, 3555/5). Found in 1927 inside the dwelling. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 7.2 cm. This is most likely a blank for a figurine. The head, shoulders, and sloping breast have been outlined. The remainder is in the form of a rounded shaft, and the surface shows traces of having been smoothed off by a flint tool. Half of the head was split off in the process of manufacture and further work was discontinued (Zamiatnin 1935:69, Fig. 25v [Russian letter]). Three Fragments of Figurines. Found in 1927 in- side the dwelling. Made of mammoth ivory. One of them represents the right leg of a human body. It has been broken off at the knee, but the shank is well expressed and the foot is carefully shaped. Another fragment, showing the concentric lines of the exfoliation of the ivory, represents a portrayal of the female breast. The third fragment is of in- determinate form. These fragments were found at a considerable distance from one another, and more</page><page sequence="33">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 33 than- likely they belong to different figurines (Zamiat- nin 1935:69). ORNAMENTS AND DECORATION. Among the orna- ments found at Gagarino were two pendants of mam- moth ivory which were in imitation of the atrophied canines of the deer (PI. XXV: 11, 12) and nineteen teeth of both the polar fox and common fox with holes for suspension (PI. XXV:7-10; see Zamiatnin 1935:60-61, Fig. 20:1-7). On a piece of thin tubular bone (possibly a needle case?) there is a light ornamental incision made up of short lines arranged in two's and three's (PI. XXV:13, Coll. IE, 3555/20; see Zamiatnin 1935:58, 60, Fig. 20:8, 8a). In addi- tion to these there are nine fragments of plates made of mammoth ivory in this collection. They bear deliberately made cuts, sometimes of an orna- mental character ( PI. XXV:14-17, Coll. IE, 3354/3- 11; see Zamiatnin 1935:60, Fig. 21). 14. Sungir1 The Palaeolithic site of Sungir' is located with- in the precincts of the city of Vladimir on the Kliaz'- ma River. The first excavation took place in 195 7. Along with an abundant flint inventory, bone arti- facts and mammoth fauna, there were also found a flat bone figurine of an animal, decorated with orna- mentation and tinted with ochre (Pis. XXIV: 14 and XXVI: 8). It was lying in a vertical position head first in the cultural level of a rather small depres- sion in one of the relatively thick accumulations of cultural remains in Excavation I, Square 6/147. ■ The figurine is in the form of a bone plate, not perfectly flat, with a length of 5.6 cm. and a thick- ness of from 4 to 2 mm. and less (the upper, and especially the fore part, of the head is pointed al- most like a cutting edge). The animal is portrayed schematically and in profile. Both pairs of legs have been reproduced in the form of two wedge- shaped projections. Hardly any traces of the initial working have been preserved; they can best be observed on the head in the form of weak striations and subsequent polishing. The entire surface was painstakingly polished to a lustre, particularly the projecting places. This may be due in part to the fact that the figurine was worn as an amulet. The correctness of this supposition is evidenced by the presence of a through opening on the hind leg. The diameter of this opening is 2-2.5 mm., not a true circle, and executed by bifacial drilling. "This section, dedicated to the Sungir1 Site, was written by O. N. Bader. On both sides the contours of the animal are again even more schematically repeated by means of lines which consist of small, shallow ly drilled punctates which are round and have a diameter of from 1 to 2 mm. each. Not counting the drilled hole on the hind leg, there are 48 of these on one side, 44 on the other. On the body itself there are two rows of dots, on the legs, one row. There are traces of bright red ochre in some of these punctates, and it also occurs in patches over the surface on both sides. From this, one is able to surmise that the figurine was painted red in ancient times. It is impossible to define with certainty the kind of animal our primitive artist wished to portray in this case. Most likely it is a horse of a type not unlike the large-headed tarpan, or something close to it in form. (According to V. I. Gromov, the bones of a small but heavy-legged horse were present at this site, but it has not been identified more spe- cifically as yet, the skull being missing.) The some- what sagging belly may have been intended to portray a mare in foal. We will not enter into a comparison at this point of the Sungir1 horse with those depicted on the few bas-reliefs, the hundreds of cave and rock paintings, or even the other isolated examples of Palaeolithic sculptures, but we will make mention of the fact that the technique of execution of the figurine from Sungir1 has analogies in Western and Central Europe, and even in distant Siberia (Mal'ta). However, not one of the Palaeolithic portrayals known to us is a close analogy to the Sungir' horse, whose basic feature is the flat, not three-dimensional, manner of execu- tion, with schematic repetition of the figure by means of punctate lines. Besides the above described figurine, this site yielded quite a few ornaments made of bone, antler, stone and shell. The beads made of bone and antler can be sub- divided into three types. To the first of these belong the rather flat, subquadrangular beads with an aver- age size of 9 X 12 mm., and with very narrow (about 1.5 mm.) round perforations which were cut through on one end. Beads belonging to the second type are massive and are distinguished by their more elongated pro- portions. On an average their dimensions are 13 X 6 X 4-5 mm. The openings are also narrow and round; they were cut through in the center, but not before the bead was first planed off and flattened on both sides. Beads of the third type are distinguished by their miniature size (their diameters are, in all, be- tween 4-6 m.); the beads are either round or angular, and the openings, which penetrate all the way through, are very narrow, being about 1 mm. in diameter (PI. XXVI:6, 7).</page><page sequence="34">34 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 There are also beads which are still in their initial stages of preparation and blanks for them. In addition to beads, pendants made from the canine of the polar fox are well represented. They have round openings on the roots which as a rule have been either cut through or drilled through, usually from both sides (PI. XXVI:9-H). The open- ing on one of them does not go all the way through, having been drilled only from one side. A small, subquadrangular piece of belemnite was also found. There are traces of whittling on it, and an artificial transverse waist to be used as a fastening. Two large fossil shells are worthy of attention. Their rather small pierced openings are located on the narrower end, and it is possible that they served as ornaments (PI. XXVI: 12). And lastly several pendants were found at this site. They consisted of natural flat pebbles of vari- ous elongated, but fortuitous, forms. The openings located on the narrow end were drilled either from two sides or from one side (PI. XXVI: 13-15). A one- sided, conical drilling was made to a depth of 3.5 m. There were many bones and pieces of antler on which the cuts were sometimes placed very close together. 15. Avdeevo Avdeevo is located about forty kilometers from Kursk on the left bank of Ragozna Creek, not far from its confluence with the Seim River. Many of the features of this site are very reminiscent of Kosten- ki I. The cultural level was bedded at a depth of 1.1-1.6 m. The excavations of Voevodskii and Rogachev exposed the oval- shaped outline of a dwelling area 40 m. in length and 15-19 m. in width, around which were located large hollows, apparently the remains of pit houses. Under the cultural level in the center of the dwelling area some rather small pits were found that contained unusually valuable artifacts. PORTRAYALS OF WOMEN. Four female figurines made of mammoth ivory were discovered here. One of them looked as though it was a crude blank, while two others were roughly worked. Only one of the figurines was perfected in form and execution. Female Figurine No. 1 (PI. XXVII: 1). It was found during the excavations of Rogachev in 1949 inside the dwelling in pit No. 2 7. The material is mammoth ivory. Dimensions: length, 16 cm.; width, 3 cm.; thickness, 1.1 cm. This is the only completed fig- urine from Avdeevo, and it represents a tall, slender woman. In length this figurine is extremely drawn out, while its thickness is almost negligible. One could almost call it a flat sculpture. It is preserved almost in its entirety with the exception of some slight damage on its back. The lower part of the legs was broken off in ancient times. The head is dis- proportionately small, slightly inclined forward, round in form with a projecting facial part, the de- tails of which were not designated. Narrow shoulders, low placed, pendulous breasts, a round, relatively flat abdomen which smoothly merges into the pubic triangle - these features have been shaped on a long, flat torso. The back is flat with an insignificant curve. The arms are outlined by a light line and are designated only down to the elbows; from there they apparently repose under the breasts. The long, slen- der legs have graceful outlines. The upper part is divided by a deep line, but lower down they separate altogether. The knees bend inward. Three parallel, fine lines possibly intended to represent a bracelet can be traced on the left arm. Deeply carved, straight, thin lines crossing each other in a disorderly fashion can be seen on the flat breast above the polishing. There are also a few poorly preserved fine transverse lines on the breasts which are probably intended to reproduce either tattooing or some kind of clothing (Gvozdover 1953:216-217, Fig. 21). Figurine No. 2 (Pis. XXVII: 2 and XXVIII: 1). Found in 1948 by Voevodskii inside the dwelling in a pit in sections XI-D/8, 9 under a patch of the cultural level. Made of mammoth ivory. Height, 12.5 cm.; width, 3.5 cm. This figurine was not completely finished although the basic features of the body can be distinguished to the degree that one is able to say that it is a portrayal of a nude woman. Individual portions were not formed; the head has not been completely worked out, the breasts, portions of the back, and the left buttock are not distinguishable, and the legs are fragmentary. The head is dispro- portionately large (almost l/4 of the length of the body); the face is bowed downwards. The neck is short and thick. The shoulders are almost as wide as the thighs, and the arms, pressed close to the body, come together on the protruding lower part of the abdomen. Hands are not indicated. One shoulder, the bend of the elbow, and the forearm are shown in relief, and they have normal proportions. The flat abdomen is sharply delineated from the thighs, and the short legs are disproportionately stout. They are separated both in the front and back by a deep groove, which does not, however, penetrate all the way through. The thighs, knees, and calves have been sculptured as well as one foot including the heel and round sole, the latter being slightly raised at the toes. On the whole, this sculpture has a look of angu- larity about it, but even so it is still very realistic. It portrays a compact but not fat woman of small stature who has been treated in a summary manner. In regard to details, the two parallel bands over the</page><page sequence="35">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 35 chest should be mentioned. It is possible that they indicate some kind of a shoulder belt (Gvozdover 1953:214-216, Fig. 20). Figurine No. 3 (PI. XXVII: 3). Found together with Figurine No. 2 in 1948 by Voevodskii in a pit of sections XI-D/8, 9 under an area of the cultural level. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 14.5 cm.; width (at its greatest point), 4 cm. It repre- sents a plump woman with relatively narrow should- ers and wide thighs, the latter being without an excessive fatty accumulation, however. The figurine was not completed and has a highly schematized appearance. The front part of the figurine is strongly deformed. The main details of the upper half of the body - the head, hands, shoulders, breasts, and also the thighs - are depicted. The head, by tradi- tion, is inclined forward. The arms are shown in relief down to the elbows, but below that point they are not designated. A slight reshaping of the mam- moth's tusk has reproduced the crown, occiput and shoulders. The smooth lines of the back in the re- gion of the waist pass over to those of the slightly prominent buttocks and thighs. The legs and but- tocks are not outlined. This figurine tapers down- ward from the thighs forming an elongated triangle. Judging by the rest of the proportions of the blank, the legs would have been depicted at full length as on the other Avdeevo figurines (Gvozdover 1953:214, Fig. 19). Figurine No. 4 (PI. XXVII: 4). Found in 1948 at a distance of 4 m. from the pit that contained figurines Nos. 2 and 3. Made of mammoth ivory. Height, 16 cm.; width, 4.5 cm. It represents the initial blank for a figurine. The narrow end of the tusk was cut by sawing and was broken along this line. Only the head with its characteristic forward tilt has been outlined. The shoulders and flat chest are barely designated. The facial part of the head was broken off long ago (Gvozdover 1953:214, Fig. 18). ANTHROPOMORPHIC PORTRAYALS. All those various objects, the forms of which bear a semblance to a human being, are included in this section. Seated Figurine (Pis. XXVIII: 2 and XXIX: 1). Found in 1947. Made from the metacarpal of a mammoth. Height, 9 cm. Almost without any artificial detail, the natural form of this bone reproduces by itself the outline of a seated human with outstretched legs. The somewhat flattened sphere of the articulation surface of the bone forms the upper limits of the head on which there is a series of random abrasions, and the sponge-like substance inside the bone is revealed on the ball-shaped face. The eye sockets are sunk deeply under the low forehead, separated from each other by a rather small straight arch, the bridge of the nose. A small ear projects in relief from the left side, and the mouth is reproduced by a round hollow. The outlines of the face - the cheek bones and cheeks - have been reproduced in a plastic manner. The head is delineated from the sloping shoulders by a wide, deep and round groove, i.e., the neck. Serving as the base on which the figurine is able to stand is the flat proximal articulation sur- face (Gvozdover 1953:218, Fig. 22). An Object made of Soft Sandstone (PI. XXIX: 2). Length, 3.5 cm.; thickness, 2.5 cm. In technique of execution it resembles the anthropomorphic heads from Kostenki I. It has a round smooth surface on which there were carved a few vertical and horizontal lines symmetrically arranged, with a depth of up to 0.5 cm.; and a width up to 0.7 cm. The overall pic- ture made by these lines creates the impression of a mask (Gvozdover 1953:219, Fig. 23). Four Sculptured Objects. Because of their resemb- lance to the anthropomorphic sculptures of Kostenki I, we are going to include these objects in this sec- tion. Gvozdover calls them "pointed objects with caps" or "animal legs." These pointed objects have been carefully processed, and, at the same time, they still manage to retain the form of the bone from which they were fashioned. Their heads were carved out of the flat articulation surfaces; in the central part the curve of the bone reproduces a knee, slightly broadened, which culminates further down into a fine-, carefully smoothed point. No. 1 (PI. XXX: 7, Coll. MA MGU, 474/5307). This shaft is round in section and has a slightly flattened cap set at a slant to the long axis of the artifact. The upper part of the shaft is decorated along the edge by short horizontal lines, while the opposite end has been chiseled out to a thin elongated point. The length of the object is 17.5 cm. (Gvozdover 1953:205-206, Fig. 12). No. 2 (PI. XXX:6, Coll. MA MGU, 474/5308). It is distinguished by its curved form. The tip of the point has been broken off and the cap was made by cutting and smoothing out the articulation surface. There is a small bulge on the neck behind this for- ward projecting cap. Along the edge of the cap there is a design which is made up of oblique crosses. The front of the upper part of the shaft is ornamented with oblique crosses and small teeth. Gvozdover thinks that the shaping of the point is an obvious reproduction of an animal's legs (Gvozdover 1953: 206, Fig. 13:a). No. 3 (PI. XXX:5). The length is 6.1 cm. This object has been carefully formed, but at the same time the natural features of the bone have been retained. The cap was made from the articulation surface, placed at an angle, and it curves slightly inward. The neck projects strongly backward. Approximately in the center of the object there is an abrupt turn which tapers off into a thin round point; the tip is damaged. The front of the neck is ornamented by a clear-cut cogged design, and on the back there are straight transverse cuts (Gvozdover 1953:206-207, Fig. 13:b).</page><page sequence="36">36 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 No. 4. This one represents a fragment of the middle part of an artifact, with a projecting thickened knee. It has the same characteristic decoration. In the opinion of Gvozdover, the shape of these above mentioned objects would indicate that they were very suitable for use either as awls or punches as evidenced by the smoothness of their points. ZOOMORPHIC PORTRAYALS. A mammoth figurine and some bone objects with zoomorphic contours are to be classified under this group. Mammoth Figurine (PI. XXVIII: 7 and XXIX: 5). Found in 1948 by Voevodskii in a pit in the excavated dwelling at a depth of 2 m. from the modern surface. It was made from the spongy mass of an oval piece of bone which, according to Gromov, was very likely taken from a mammoth vertebra. The dimen- sions of this figurine are: greatest length, 9.5 cm.; height, 7.2-8.6 cm.; width, 3 cm. Almost the entire plane of the upper surface on the right side has been lopped off. The left side, which is consider- ably better preserved, is bulging and creates the impression of some incompleteness in the region of the hind legs. The edge of the fore part of the head and trunk have been damaged, and the ends of the legs are missing. The figurine portrays a quietly standing animal. The manner in which the charac- teristic outlines of the mammoth were reproduced was sparing, but nonetheless very expressive. Its powerful, slightly lowered head with the wide fore- head and short trunk are separated from the body and forelegs by means of a wide furrow. The trunk is reproduced by a deep groove on both sides. A depression on the forehead delineates the upper part of the head from the glabellar region and root of the trunk, while a little lower down the eyes are shown as rather small hollows over which their orbits project. The front legs are separated from the belly by a deep notch. The contours of the back are unusually well expressed and are anatomically correct. A steep rise separates the neck from the hump; the latter sharply falls into the pelvic region, and then terminates in a slightly prominent sacrum. The tail is delineated from the back by a small de- pression. The bulkiness that has been reproduced in the region of the shoulders tapers off toward the spine which is separated from the shoulders and sides by a somewhat shallow longitudinal groove (Gvozdover 1952). Zoomorphic Objects. Gvozdover regards these as pendants, possibly as reproductions of schematized animal muzzles (mammoth?). Three objects broken to one degree or another were discovered here. They are made from plates of mammoth ivory. One of them, a thin elongated plate, has been broken off only on the lower end and was carefully smoothed on both sides (PI. XXX: 1, Coll. MA MGU, 474/4567). The facial side has a slight convex bulge; the re- verse side is concave. A rather small round tab with a little round opening projects at an angle to the base. There is a narrow ornament of oblique crosses along the smoothed edges and approximately in the center; lengthwise along this object there is a row of short transverse lines cut in a haphazard manner. This row intersects, on the widest part of the arti- fact, another row of haphazard lines which extends out to the edge in some places, thus coming into con- tact with the above mentioned thin crosses. Thin rectangular cuts form the design on the top of the reverse side of this object. The length of the ob- ject is 7 cm.; the width at the top, 2.5 cm., on the lower part, 1 cm.; and the thickness, which increases a little below, is 0.3 cm. (Gvozdover 1953:210-211, Fig. 166). The second object is of this same kind in form, but the lower portion has been broken off and its dimensions are somewhat larger (PI. XXX: 2, Coll. MA MGU, 474/4567). Both of the surfaces and the edge of this object have been carefully cut and pol- ished. Numerous randomly applied abrasions can be seen over the polishing. A narrow design made up of oblique crosses runs along the edges. This article, when whole, ought to have had a length of about 13 cm.; the fragment has a length of 8.5 cm. The width of the upper part is 5 cm.; the thickness of the upper part is 0.5 cm., and on the lower part it is 0.7 cm. (Gvozdover 1953:211, Fig. 16:a). Only a small fragment from the upper part of the third ob- ject has been preserved. Tops or Figured Heads: Long Bone Spatulas. These objects also have zoomorphic outlines, re- calling analogous objects from Kostenki. The pur- pose of the spatulas is not clear, since no traces of use have remained on them. Complete spatulas have not been found in Avdeevo, but there are three frag- ments of them, each having a figured head. The first fragment is a thin plate flaring at the top (PI. XXIX: 3), where two pairs of oblong openings have been cut through. The lower expanded part is decorated with straight lines which come together to form an angle. There is a design along the edges of this fragment consisting of straight cuts and sharp teeth. The length of the fragment is 7 cm.; the width, 1.5 cm.; and the thickness is 0.27 cm. (Gvozdover 1953: 205, Fig. 10:a). The second fragment was made from a mammoth's rib (PI. XXIX:4, Coll. MA MGU, 474/4542). One side is slightly convex and the other side is correspond- ingly concave. The top has the appearance of a round head with two pairs of obliquely placed cut openings. The edge of this head bears a design of oblique crosses which continue down the narrow shaft of the spatula. The length of the fragment is 7 cm.; the width of the head is 2.1 cm. (Gvozdover 1953:205, Fig. 11: a, v [Russian letter]). The third spatula fragment differs a little from</page><page sequence="37">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 37 the previous ones (Coll. MA MGU, 474/4577). The head is not perfectly rounded, having a straight upper line which is ornamented by short, straight cuts. Small round tabs stand out along both edges, and two pairs of holes, not penetrating all the way through, have been carved out on both sides of the head. The length of the article is 7.5 cm. and the width of the head is 2 cm. This head bears a spec- ial resemblance to a stylized portrayal of an ani- mal's muzzle, in particular to that of a member of the felids (Gvozdover 1953:205, Fig. lib, g [Russian letters]). INDETERMINATE SCULPTURED ARTICLES. Two objects were discovered at Avdeevo, the purpose of which is unclear. Objects Made of Mammoth Tusk with a Rounded Head and a Short Sharp Point (PI. XXVIII:4, Coll. MA MGU, 474/4577). Its overall length is 3 cm., and the separate length each of the head and point is about 1.5 cm. Typologically, writes Gvozdover (1953:207), it resembles the so-called stoppers of wine skins. This suggestion, however, is contra- dicted both by the measurements and shape of the point. Gvozdover has also proposed that it was possibly used as a short, somewhat blunt punch, or perhaps as the very easily springing part of a trap. Artifact Made of Mammoth Tusk (PI. XXVIII:3, Coll. MA MGU, 474/5316). Length, 6.5 cm.; width, 2»5 cm.; thickness, 0.6 cm. The object has an elon- gated leaf shape with pointed ends. Both of its flat sides have been carefully smoothed. In an article by M. V. Voevodskii and A. E. Alikhovaia- Voevodskaia(1950:l6, Fig. 7:5, 5a), this object was termed fish-like in appearance. Gvozdover (1953: 205) thinks that it was possibly used as a punch. ORNAMENTS. Gvozdover has noted that if one were to judge by the discoveries at Avdeevo, it would be possible to assert that the head band was a common article of apparel for Palaeolithic man. One of these head bands from Avdeevo (PI. XXX: 3, Coll. MG MGU, 474/5516) has been preserved in its entirety. It was carefully carved from a thin plate of mammoth ivory. The length of this curved band along the chord is 19 cm. It is narrow on both ends and widens smoothly toward the center (from 0.9 to 2.1 cm.). Oval in section, its thickness is 0.3 cm. On each narrow, rounded end there is a long aperture penetrating all the way through which more than likely was intended for a narrow thong to be run through thereby connecting the ends of the band so as to tighten it on the head. The entire surface has been thoroughly polished. Closer to the right end on the exterior of this band there is a decoration consisting of two fascicles of asymmetrical curved lines (Gvozdover 1953:208, Fig. 15:a). A flat slightly curved shaft of mammoth ivory can also be regarded as belonging to the same cate- gory (Coll. MA MGU, 474/4529). The length is 20.5 cm.; the thickness, 0.4-0.5 cm. The width is almost equal for the entire length (1 cm.), and dim- ishes somewhat only toward the ends. One of the ends which was rounded out and slightly flattened has an elongated hole, but the opposite end is broken off right at the commencement of a similar opening (Gvozdover 1953:208, 210, Fig. 15:b). There are four fragments which closely resemble the previous object. They are made of flat, narrow shafts of mammoth ivory with holes cut through on their rounded ends (Coll. MA MGU, 474/4530, 4440, 4443; see Gvozdover 1953:210, Fig. 15:v, d). In addition to this no less than fifteen fragments were found at this site that were similar in width and thickness to the foregoing and shaped like flat oval shafts. Certain of them had a slight curve. The majority of them had been painstakingly decorated on the convex side with the herring bone, zigzag, and other geometric designs (Pis. XXVIII: 5 -6 and XXX:4, 10). Certain of them had been broken off at the beginning of the perforation. It is possible to assume that part of these shafts are fragments of head bands, and it is not ruled out that the thinner, narrower ones with the more pronounced curve repre- sent fragments of bracelets (Coll. MA MGU, 474/ 5329, 4511; see Gvozdover 1953:210, Figs. 10:b, 15:ch [Russian letters]). Two fragments of objects differ a little from the above mentioned, but it is possible they still have the same purpose. One of them is a flat shaft with rather small dimensions: length, 6 cm.; width, 1 cm.; thickness, 0.3 cm. (PI. XXX: 11, Coll. MA MGU, 474/ 532 7). It tapers off smoothly from the wider end to the other. The outer side has been carefully decorated with the herring bone design, and this is framed by straight lines which go lengthwise along the edges. There is a small round opening in the center of it (Gvozdover 1953:210, Fig. 15:e). The second frag- ment of a shaft has been executed in a more hap- hazard manner and was not decorated. Its length is 4 cm.; width, 1.5 cm.; and thickness, 0.3 cm. There is also a round hold cut through the center of it (Coll. MA MGU, 474/5310; see Gvozdover 1953: 210). A rather small piece of an artifact was found at this site which resembles the small shafts with swellings from the settlements of Mezin and Push- kari I (Coll. MA MGU, 474/4403). This fragment was carved out of mammoth ivory and has the shape of a flattened cylinder. The dimensions are very small: 0.6 X 0.5 X 0.3 cm.). Both ends bear traces of fracture which testify to the fact that this "swell- ing" was present on each side. Apparently the break also passed along the waist (Gvozdover 1953:210). In regard to the use of animals' teeth as orna- mentation, there were found at Avdeevo eight polar</page><page sequence="38">38 fox canines with elongated openings which were cut through in the roots, thirteen wolves' canines and incisors with perforations and deep transverse sawings on the roots, and two bears' canines with notches for suspension (PI. XXX: 8, 9; see Gvozdover 1953:210). DECORATION. The elements of design at Avdeevo are few and mostly of a geometric character. The most widely used design was a row of short trans- verse dashes. If there were two rows of these lines, each inclined in a different direction, then the design took on the appearance of oblique crosses and sharp angles. This type of design is seen most frequently of all on the edges of arti- facts where it has been applied by means of very thin lines. There are twelve examples of this kind. These elements of design frequently become more complicated and assume the form of the her- ringbone or zigzag. The former supplied the decora- tive motif for seven artifacts, and in one case it was framed by a clear-cut straight line, while in yet another it was supplemented by rows of notches. Sometimes the design was made up of parallel rows of either straight or arched lines to which short, small notches were added perpendicularily from above or below. Fascicles of short curved lines were carved on the whole head band. An important element of decoration appears to be unclosed quadrangles composed of oblique checkerwork. The entire design elements of a needle case made of a swan's bone are composed of the decorative elements of symmetrically arranged lines, rows of crosses and oblique checkerwork (PI. XXX: 12). It is of interest that fragments of mammoth ivory (sometimes very large ones) were often dec- orated. On the concave inner surface of one of these there was a striped pattern about 20 cm. long and 8 cm. wide, made up of irregular right angled cross hatching and arranged at random partially overlapping each other (PI. XXX: 13; see Gvozdover 1953:221, Fig. 25). On one large tusk, also on the concave side, there were three closely arranged, equi-distant, separate rows which were composed of short, trans- verse, straight, parallel cuts. On the other side of the tusk there was a second series of cuts which were complicated by either irregular intersecting or supplementing lines (Gvozdover 1953:221, Fig. 26). 16. Mezin The Mezin settlement is located on the right bank of the Desna about 25 kilometers below Nov- gorod-Severskii. During the excavations of 1909, Arctic Anthropology IV-2 Efimenko discovered a large accumulation of mammoth tusks and reindeer antlers. The cultural level here was bedded in a noticeably perceptible depression at the bottom of which were discovered the most in- teresting artifacts, including sculptured portrayals carved from mammoth ivory with complex ornamental designs (Volkov 1912:415). In 1912-1913 the number of works of art was considerably increased; the so- called birds were found in addition to bracelets carved from ivory and with complex geometric de- signs (Mizin 1931). At the resumption of work on this site in the years 1954-1956, I. G. Shovkoplias and I. G. Pidop- lichko discovered new and unique works of art (Shovkoplias 1957a). During these years the cul- tural level of this site was laid bare to an extent of nearly 600 square meters. The remains of a round dwelling were uncovered in the north-western section in which there were found art objects. We will first of all refer to those distinctive figurines which can be clearly separated into two types, even though transitional forms between them can be traced - figurines of the so-called birds and of the phallic type. FIGURINES OF BIRDS. Because of their form, the figurines of the first type resemble the outlines of birds - a small head, round body, and long, flat tail. There were six such figurines differing from each other only by dimensions and degree of preservation. All of them were covered by an intricate, complex carved decoration. * Bird Figurine No. 1 (PI. XXXI: 1). Made of mammoth ivory. It resembles a bird with a small head, bulging breast, and a long flat tail, the end of which is ex- panded and has been rounded off. A decoration covers almost the entire surface except for the head which is separated from the body by a deep line. The lat- eral sides of the figurine are decorated by triangular rows of zigzags, and a portion of the back by various elements of the meander. Double parallel lines are arranged so as to form two angles on one side of the tail - a straight longitudinal line from which short slanting lines radiate is carved down the cen- ter of the other side. The flat surface of the breast is taken up by a triangle outlined by double lines with a convex base (Mizin 1931:43, 57, PI. XVI). Bird Figurine No. 2 (PI. XXX: 2). Made of mammoth ivory. It differs from the previous one only in cer- We have not had the opportunity to become familiarized with the originals of these figurines from Mezin. The descriptions here are based on the re- productions and casts of them which are kept at the Section of Archaeology of the Institute of Ethnography, Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.</page><page sequence="39">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. tain details - the head is elongated and semi-oval in outline, the body is shorter and wider, but the tail, although broken on the end, is also expanded, and its edges have been rounded off. Aside from certain differences, the ornamental design consists of the same elements as does Figurine No. 1. The triangle on the flat side is transformed into a sharp unclosed acute angle, and the entire area inside is covered by fine irregular hachures. There are some very regularly arranged rows of meanders on the convex side. On one side, the tail has a design made up of five chevrons arranged in a parallel array with the points facing downwards. The other side has the same motif of straight, longitudinal lines as does Figurine No. 1. The space on the lat- eral sides, however, is filled by a meander (Mizin 1931:44, 58, PI. XVII). Bird Figurine No. 3 (PI. XXXI: 3). Made of mammoth ivory. It is analogous to Figurine No. 1 except for the broken tail. The semi-oval head and rounded body are clearly designated. The placement and elements of the decorative pattern are completely like those of Figurine No. 1, but here the difference lies in the considerably greater care of execution. The double lines of the isosceles triangle with a convex base are drawn in a very clear-cut manner, and this is also true of the parallel zigzag lines, and especially so for those of the meanders (Mizin 1931:44, 58, PI. XVIII: 1). Bird Figurine No. 4 (PI. XXXI: 4). Made of mammoth ivory. It is analogous to the previous one even to the broken tail. The small round head is compactly joined with the body; the lines of the body are con- vex. There is the same type of triangle on the breast, but in this case the double sides are slightly concave and the base is convex. The design on the lateral sides is very plain, consisting only of straight lines and chevrons. Broken lines forming angles with the point directed toward the head fill the entire surface of the back (Mizin 1931:44, 58, PI. XVIII: 2). Bird Figurine No. 5 (PI. XXXI: 5). Made of mammoth ivory. Analogous to the previous ones. The head is quite large, semi-circular in shape, and the body is short and rounded. The tail has been partially broken off. The ornamental design of this figurine is of interest. The triangle with its convex base occupies its traditional place and the remaining surface is covered with big, parallel zigzags. The design on the back is quite unusual inasmuch as it should have obviously repeated the pattern found on Figurine No. 4. In this instance the enthusiasm for the zigzag motif breaks through the principle of the division of the circle into four sectors and al- lows one to observe the first indication of the future meander (Mizin 1931:44-45, 58, PI. XIX: 1). Bird Figurine No. 6 (PI. XXXI: 6). Made of mammoth ivory. This figurine is completely intact and is the 39 smallest in size. In general outline it is particularly close to Figurine No. 1. It has an elongated head, semi-oval in shape, a round body, and a tail of pro- portional size. There is an incomplete triangle with a convex base on the flat side. The entire surface of the convex side is covered with various combina- tions of chevrons. The pattern is divided into four sections, each of which has a row of chevrons whose tops all point inward toward each other. This prin- ciple of decorative design has already been observed on Figurine No. 4 where no traces of the meander were present, and on No. 5 which had one meander flourish in the center, and finally on No. 1 whose relief surface was covered by four meander flourishes similarly drawn, although it was [obvious] that the technique had not yet been mastered (Mizin 1931: 45, 58-59, PI. XIX:2). PHALLIC FIGURINES . Eleven figurines from Mezin can be regarded as belonging to the category of the so-called phallic type. Their forms are different from those of the bird figurines. By their general outlines they all resemble each other in spite of the variations in measurements. No. 1 (PI. XXXII: 1). The material is mammoth ivory. It has the appearance of a large, rounded, elongated shaft, and bears traces of having careful workman- ship. The polished surface has been decorated. One end is flattened and bent, and close to the other part of the second, blunt end is a convex fillet. Traces of wide cuts and breakage can be seen on the blunt end bounded by the fillet. The design which covers the convex part of the shaft consists of inverted chevrons which are formed by two, and in one case, three rows of lines. The design on the concave part is more complex, consisting of trapezoidal figures made by pairs of double parallel lines (Mizin 1931: 38, 54, Pis. XI: 1 and XII: 1). No. 2 (PI. XXXII: 2). The material is mammoth ivory. It is analogous to the preceding one, but the shaft is considerably shorter (about 2/5 of its overall length). The blunt end of this shaft is also short and has been rounded, but in this case the processing was more thorough. The shape of this article, writes F. K. Volkov, reminds one of an acorn that was flat- tened on one side (1912:426). In contrast to No. 1, the design here has, for the most part, been spread over the massive fillet. It bears a strong resemblance to the design found on the bird figurines; here there is also a triangle, but in this instance it has rounded corners and the straight, longitudinal lines between which are rhombs, chevrons, and parallel rows of zigzags (Mizin 1931:38, 54, Pis. XI: 2 and XII:2). No. 3 (PI. XXXII: 3). The material is mammoth ivory. Analogous to the previous one in shape, dimensions, and ornamental design. Under the wide, markedly convex fillet there is a short, blunt end. The oppo- site end of this flattened shaft has been rounded.</page><page sequence="40">40 The ornamental design of both the fillet and shaft has been placed chiefly on one side of the object. There is an odd looking, sub-triangular figure with a semi-circular base located on the fillet, the in- side of which is filled with parallel lines placed at right angles to the base of the triangle. The shaft is covered with sub-rectangular figures very similar to the design on No. 1. Rows of oblique lines radiate from this figure (Mizin 1931:42, 56, PI. XV: 1). No. 4 (PL XXXII:4). The material is mammoth ivory. Similar to Nos. 2 and 3, differing only in proportion of details. The fillet is considerably narrower. The blunt end has the appearance of a cone, the top of which bears distinct traces of a break. The shaft is short and has been rounded as with No. 3. Traces of an ornamental design were not observed ( Mizin 1931:40, 55, PI. XIII: 2). No. 5 (PL XXXII: 6). The material is mammoth ivory. In size this one is the smallest of the series. It closely resembles No. 2, differing from it only by having a wider fillet. The latter is separated from the shaft by a sharp indentation. The design, though poorly preserved, has elements about it that are very similar to those of No. 3, and the flattened shaft with its rounded end more closely resembles Nos. 3 and 4 (Mizin 1931:42, 56-57, PL XV:2). No. 6 (.PL XXXIII: 1). The material is mammoth ivory. Analogous to the previous ones, but in a worse state of preservation. It was not as carefully fash- ioned, and a wide area has been broken off. The decorative design is not well expressed, consisting as it does of simple lines. Some chevrons, how- ever, can be seen on the relief side of the object (Mizin 1931:41, PL XIII:4). No. 7 (PL XXXIII: 16). The material is mammoth ivory. It is similar to the previous ones, and it has not been preserved in its entirety. The flattened shaft has been broken off on the end. The fillet is wide and low and merges together with the body of the shaft, thereby forming an elongated body. The decorative design has almost been obliterated; only some fine, short, often intersecting lines and hachures were noted (Mizin 1931:40-41, 55-56, Pis. XIII: 3 and XIV: 2). No. 8 (PI: XXXII: 5). The material is mammoth ivory. The proportions approach those of No. 1 , although its blunt-tipped shaft is longer and narrower, and the fillet is lower. The latter exists only on one side and is separated from the shaft by a clear-cut, wide groove. The blunt end was rounded out and appears to have been broken off, while the shaft shows careful working, and has been decorated. Several elements of design are different, and the principle motifs appear to be the zigzags and soli- tarily arranged rows of herringbone between which have been arranged diamond shaped figures. Sub- rectangular forms, inside of which were carved Arctic Anthropology IV -2 double chevrons, can be traced on the lateral sides of this object (Mizin 1931:40, 55, Pis. XIII: 1 and XIV: 1). No. 9 (PL XXXIII: 2). The material is mammoth ivory. This one has been split along the length of its axis. By its general contours it resembles the previous ones, but it differs from them inasmuch as it has a very pronounced convex fillet which tapers off to a little round head. The tip of the shaft has been broken off. The decoration on the shaft is made up of individual lines which spread out in pairs at an acute angle (Mizin 1931:42-43, PL XV:4, 4a). No. 10 (PL XXXIII: 3). The material is mammoth ivory. It is similar to the previous one. The shaft is round and there is a conical projection on one side. The ends of the shaft are rounded (Mizin 1931:43, 57, PL XV:5). No. 11 (PL XXXIII: 17). The material is mammoth ivory. This shaft is round in form and there is a low, wide projection on one side. There are traces of breakage on the end close to this projection; the opposite end is pointed ( Mizin 1931:42, 57, PL XV:3). UNIDENTIFIABLE FIGURINES. During the excava- tions at Mezin in 1955, Shovkoplias and Pidoplichko found some objects which resemble crude anthropo- morphic figurines. They were discovered on the floor of a dwelling. First of all there were two round pieces of mammoth ivory, each of which had a length of about 30 cm. No details whatsoever were noted on these pieces except for the encircling groove on the upper part which appeared to be a separation be- tween the large head and body, the latter tapering off below to a point. According to the opinion of Shovkoplias, these objects were intended as sche- matized anthropomorphic figurines, but their overall crudity and lack of working leave this assumption open to debate (Shovkoplias 1956:9, Fig. 6; 1957b, Fig. on page 39). There are two figurines which obviously depict some kind of an animal, but the general schematism and lack of detail on these portrayals precludes an exact determination of their species (PL XXXIII: 4, 5). They are rather small figurines, carved from mammoth ivory, and shown in a seated pose. Both have rounded heads, and the smaller of the two has crudely exe- cuted forelegs (Mizin 1931:42, 56, PL XIV:4, 5). Efimenko (1953, Fig. 223) thinks that they are con- ventionalized figurines which were used as pendants. ORNAMENTS. It is possible that certain of the frag- ments of narrow and thin plates of mammoth ivory found at Mezin were the remains of head bands. Their description can be included in this section although some of them may have been fragments of bracelets or pendants because of their complex decorative designs. The nearest thing to the cate- gory of head bands is a thin plate of mammoth ivory,</page><page sequence="41">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 41 carefully smoothed on one side and rounded on the end, on which there was a round perforation (PI. XXXIII: 18). There was no decorative design. The length was 6.2 cm.; the width, 1.6 cm. ( Mizin 1931: 47, 61, PI. XXI:9). Another rather large plate of mammoth ivory had been carefully smoothed on one side and along the edges (PI. XXXIII: 6). Evidence of an opening was preserved on the upper part. The plate is covered by a design made of oblique parallel lines. The length is 7.7 cm.; the width, 1.5 cm. (Mizin 1931: 46-47, 60-61, Pis. XXI: 8 and XXII: 1). A third fragment is also a large plate of mam- moth ivory carefully smoothed, slightly convex on one side and tapered on the upper end where traces of a round hole can be observed (PI. XXXIII: 7). The design consists of three rows of oblique parallel lines placed at an angle to one another and joined together at the ends, thus forming a zigzag or her- ringbone. The length is 7 cm.; the width, 2.2 cm. (Mizin 1931:47, 61, Pis. XXI:10 and XXII:2). On a fragment from a plate (the middle part) of mammoth ivory there is a design on both the flat underside and the slightly convex outer surface which consists of two sets of herringbones which come together at the center to form a rhomb (PI. XXXIII: 24). The length is 4.7 cm.; the width, 0.9 cm. (Mizin 1931:47, 61, PI. XXII:3). An intricate meander design on a fragment from a plate of mammoth ivory is of interest, and although it is in a poor state of preservation, it still has a carefully smoothed surface and evenly cut edges (PI. XXXIII: 23). The pattern begins at some distance from the end of the plate which was left without decoration. The length, 6.3 cm.; the width, 0.8 cm. (Mizin 1931:47, 61, PI. XXII:4). Among these decorated plates of mammoth ivory there are eight small narrow flat fragments, only one of which is an end fragment and provided with a round hole (PI. XXXIII:20-22, 25-27, 30, 31). Their outer surfaces were covered with a carved design consisting of parallel slanting lines which form a herringbone ( Mizin 1931:47-48, 61-62, PI. XXII:5- 12). The bracelets of Mezin are unique objects, and were executed with great perfection. One of them, found in 1912, has the form of a wide, thin, curved band, the outer surface of which has been carved with an intricate geometric design made up of meanders and the herringbone (PI. XXXIV:4, 6). Three large openings for lacing are situated on each end of the bracelet. Its width is 5.3 cm. (Mizin 1931: 48, 62, Pis. XXIII, XXIV). A different type of bracelet was found in 1956. It consisted of five thin plates of mammoth ivory (length, about 19 cm.; width, approximately 1 cm.) that were supplied with round perforations on each end for lacing (PI. XXXIV: 5). These plates were apparently fastened together since they were all found in one place on the floor of a dwelling. Their outer surfaces were covered with an engraved geo- metric design composed of rows of herringbone oriented in opposed directions and uniting to form a meander or a portion of one. The design on all five plates is distinguished by the accuracy of the lines, and when these plates are joined together they form a very smart pattern (Shovkoplias 1957a: 104-105, Fig. 5). Aside from the head bands and bracelets, vari- ous pendants were found at Mezin. Two of them were made of mammoth ivory and were round in form. The first one was entire and had an oval opening, but the side of the second one had been damaged (PI. XXXIII:28, 29; see Boriskovskii 1953:279-280, Fig. 139; Mizin 1931:46, 60, PI. XXI: 7). There is another type of object also carved from mammoth ivory that could have served as a pendant. By form they looked like imitations of the atrophied canines of deer. Part of them had oval shapes, slightly expanded on one side. There were six of this type varying both in shape and by dimensions (PI. XXXIII:9-13, 15). Four of them had round open- ings in the upper part; the upper wall on one has been damaged, but the last of the six was smoothly carved (Mizin 1931:46, 60, PI. XXI: 1-6). Another pendant, having a round shape and an opening in the center was also partially damaged on the side (PI. XXXIII:8; see Mizin 1931:46, 60, PI. XXI:7). Objects made of mammoth ivory in the form of long shafts with alternating bulbous swellings and indentations probably served as fastenings. One of these shafts consists of four round bulges with rather shallow indentations (PI. XXXIII: 34). Both of its ends have been broken, but it is noticeable that one of them has been planed off flat (Mizin 1931:45, 59, PI. XX: 1). The second shaft has a flattened look and consists of two bulges which are separated by a wide indentation. The end pieces of this one have also been broken off (PI. XXXIII:33; see Mizin 1931: 45, 59, PL XX:2). The third shaft has been preserved in its entirety and was the most carefully processed of the lot (PI. XXXIII: 32). It has five bulges; the last one on one end was rounded out, but the one on the opposite end had been carved off evenly (Mizin 1931:45, 59, PI. XX:3). A piece of a similar shaft was found on which there were traces of the beginning of a drilled opening; there was only one bulge (Mizin 1931:46, 59, PI. XX:6). In addition to this one, there were found in Mezin larger shafts with indentations around the centers, which in form resemble modern wooden fastenings [toggles?]. Another specimen worth noting is an elongated shaft of ivory around the center of which was carved a round waist with gradually sloping sides (PI. XXXIII: 19). One end had been rounded, the other bears traces of some fracture (Mizin 1931:46, 59, PL XX:4).</page><page sequence="42">42 A small plate of mammoth ivory with the shape of an irregular quadrangle has a hole in the center of it; it was probably a bead or a pendant (PI. XXXIII: 14; see Mizin 1931:49, 63, PI. XXVII: 7). A large number of drilled shells, mostly of the fossil species Ceritium vilgatum Brug. and Nassa reticulata L. was found at the time of the early excavations. They were not evenly distributed throughout the entire extent of the cultural level but lay in three groups. Most of these shells (about 80 of them) were unearthed in the 1909 excavations and in the south-eastern section that was excavated next to it in 1914. Some of them were lying in the remainder of a hearth, but had not been charred. More shells were found lying among a small accumulation of bones between two hearth stains in Squares e, zh [Russian letter]-III, IV during the large scale excavations of the years 1912-1916. The third aggregation of shells was discovered dur- ing the same excavation in an oval depression to the southeast of a small hearth spot in Square e-IX. The distribution of these shells would indicate that they were not used as individual ornaments, but rather were the remains of three necklaces which had either been discarded or left behind. These shells came from the Tyrrhenian or Karangatian de- posits on the shores of the Black Sea (Boriskovskii 1953:278, Fig. 138). Further investigations of the Mezin site in re- cent years brought forth a great number of drilled shells. Pidoplichko has established the fact that these shells could not only have come from the shores of the Black and Azov Seas, but may also have come from the regions of the Lower Dnepr (Nikopol1), the Middle Dnestr, and Volynia (Rovno), where such shells are found in the Sarmatian de- posits (Shovkoplias 1957a:106). DECORATION. The decorative designs of Mezin were mainly rectilinear but they formed intricate combinations of zigzags, meanders, closed geo- metric figures, and so forth. The simplest kind of Mezin design was the acute angle which was some- times formed by double lines. Often the angle was not closed, and a series of lines, first directed to one side and then to the other, formed a vertical herringbone or a horizontal zigzag. At times rows of herringbone face one another so that when they meet in the center a symmetrical rhomb is formed, and inside this is often still another rhomb of smaller dimensions. Sometimes, if the angle is blosed, there is an equilateral triangle with a con- vex base. The most complicated pattern consists of angles which were resolved into the meander design; this is very well represented on the wide bracelet. One can distinguish five areas in this pattern on the bracelet - three of the meander and two of the herringbone, alternating between them- Arctic Anthropology IV-2 selves and making the transition from one to the other by means of unclosed angles. All these elements of decorative design can be observed on the previously described sculptured ob- jects. However, in order to give a complete picture we should include certain objects, some of which are utilitarian, while others have an undetermined purpose, but nevertheless they all have various decorative motifs on them. We will first describe the design on a tool of the polisher type made of mammoth ivory. There are wide facets on the hafted end, but the working end has been flattened and polished. In the middle of the tool there are two parallel lines from which radiate pairs of obliquely oriented cuts parallel to one another. A little higher up there is an engraved cone which resembles those conical roofs of light dwell- ings that are well known in ethnography (PI. XXXIV: 13, Mizin 1931:48, 62, PI. XXV:2). On the smoothed surfaces of both sides of a perforation in the upper part made of mammoth ivory there is a design made from pairs of oblique lines which closely resembles thread that has been wound around a needle (PI. XXXIV:12, Mizin 1931:49, 62, PI. XXV:3). A rather unusual decorating method for Mezin was used on a piece of rib. On one end wavy parallel lines of unequal length were carved which look as though they were intended to be continuous despite the break that occurs between them (PI. XXXIV: 11; Mizin 1931:48, 62, PI. XXV: 1). There are oblique, deeply engraved lines along the edges of three sides of a piece of a plate of mammoth ivory, and on one corner only is a design consisting of a band which is made up of three meander scrolls (PI. XXXIV: 7; Mizin 1931:41-42, 49, 56, 63, Pis. XIV:3 and XXV:4). During the excavations of 1956, unique art ob- jects were discovered inside a dwelling: three huge mammoth bones - a scapula and two mandibles, on which there are traces of red pigment. The same elements of geometric design were used in painting as were employed on the carved ivory tusks. Twenty zigzag lines parallel to each other can be traced over the level outer surface on the upper part of the scapula, and were painted on with a pig- ment made of red ocher. The width of each is close to 1 cm. (PI. XXXV: 1). On the right hand edge of the pattern, the elements of the meander can be seen in two instances but they have either been effaced or were weakly expressed. On the lower, widened half of the scapula the painting has been preserved only in part (Shovkoplias 1957a: 106, Fig. 6). The design painting can be distinctly seen on the mandibles, but only on the right side; it has very likely been effaced on the remainder of the surface because only colored patches can be seen here and there. The painting on one mandible consists of</page><page sequence="43">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. straight parallel lines which move in two directions 1 (PI. XXXV: 2). On the other mandible, there are two : perpendicular rows of straight lines which do not intersect (PI. XXXV:3; see Shovkoplias 1957a:105, Figs. 7 and 8). 17. Novgorod-Severskii j This site is located on the outskirts of the city of Novgorod-Severskii, on the right bank of the Desna River. During the excavations here, I. G. Pidoplichko discovered a mammoth rib which had been sawed off lengthwise, smoothed, and decorated along its entire length by transverse parallel cuts (PI. XXXIV: 1). The ends of this rib were rounded and sharpened. Its length is 59.5 cm.; the width, 2.2- 2.9 cm.; and the thickness, 0.6-0.8 cm. (Pidoplichko 1947b: 92, Fig. 17). Pidoplichko also made mention of a thin plate of decorated bone that was found here (Pidoplichko 1947b: 91). 18. Pushkari I This settlement is located on the right bank of the Desna, twenty five km. above the city of Novgo- rod-Severskii. During Boriskovskii's investigations here from 193 7-1939, two flat shafts of mammoth ivory with bulges and indentations were found in pits on the floor of a dwelling. One of these had eight of these protrusions separated by indentations (PI. XXXIV: 2), and the other one had two (Boriskov- skii 1953:253, Fig. 111:2). In addition to this, a fragment of mammoth ivory from an oval shaped pen- dant was found which had been pierced biconically in its center (PI. XXX-.3; see Boriskovskii 1953:223, Fig. 111:3). 19. Timonovka Timonovka is situated on the right bank of the Desna River south of the city of Briansk. V. A. Gorodtsov (1935) discovered and made a study of a dwelling of regular quadrangular form here during the years 1928-1933. The inventory of this settle- ment is composed of several fragments of bone and mammoth tusk with engraved designs that are more often than not of a geometric character and some undetermined sculptured artifacts. Their descrip- tions are given below. Object of Mammoth Ivory. It has the shape of a small staff, oval in section with a pointed end. There is a circular indentation around the opposite end. Length, about 5 cm.; diameter, 0.7-0.4 cm. (Coll. GIM, 78098, b/No.). Object of Mammoth Ivory. One end has been some- 43 what flattened and has a broken area on it. The in- ner side is smooth but the outer surface has a con- vexity which rises smoothly from the broken edge and forms a curve on the other end. The surface of this object has been smoothed out. Length, 6.2 cm.; width, about 3 cm.; thickness, 0.7 and 2.3 cm. (Coll. GIM, 78098, b/No.). Fragment of a Shaft of Mammoth Ivory. It has a care- fully smoothed surface. One end has been broken and the other end shows traces of working. Length, 2.6 cm.; diameter, 0.5 cm. (Coll. IE, 5401/534). Thin Plate of Mammoth Ivory. It has been separated into two parts by light, easy cuts. In the center of each part there is an opening sub-triangular in shape. Length, 1.4 cm.; width, 0.5 cm. (Coll. IE, 5401/533). Thin Plate of Mammoth Ivory. It has been broken into four parts; the surface is polished. One of the rounded ends of this long plate has an opening cut through which is of irregular shape. Length, 9.4 cm.; width, 0.9 cm. (PI. XXXVI: 16, Coll. IE, 5401/532). Plate of Mammoth Ivory. The end is tapered. There is a carved stylized design on the smooth outer sur- face which resembles portrayals of fish. Length, 7.8 cm.; width, 1.5 cm. (PI. XXXVI: 15, Coll. IE, 5401/ 53). Fragment of the Rib of an Animal. It has traces of working as well as a carved design on its flat sur- face. This design has the form of very elongated rhomboid figures. Length, 10.2 cm.; width, 2.6 cm. (PI. XXXVI:13, Coll. IE, 5401/539). Plate of Mammoth Ivory. Length, 6.5 cm.; width, 4 cm. It has the outline of an irregular rectangle. There is an engraving diagonally placed on its smooth outer surface in the form of oblique checks enclosed in a figure of oval form with pointed ends. The lines on one of these ends exceed the limits of the figure (PI. XXXVI: 11, Coll. IE, 5410/11). V. A. Gorodtsov (1935:10, Fig. 2) thinks that it may be the represen- tation of a fish. Similar portrayals with this oblique checker- work frequently appear on other fragments from plates of mammoth ivory at Timonovka (Coll. GIM, 78098, b/No.). We shall refer here to some large pieces of ivory with conspicuous designs. End of a Tusk of a Young Mammoth. The lower end has been broken off but the upper tip end has been trimmed off by wide cuts to the shape of a cone. The convex side of this slightly curved tusk bears traces not only of a heavy transverse blow but also of a carving made of oblique network and a wavy double line inside of which are transverse hatchings. The length of the tusk is 23 cm. (PI. XXXVI: 17, Coll. IE, 5410/14; see Gorodtsov 1935:10, Fig. 1). Fragment of Mammoth Ivory. This represents the middle part of the tusk. One end is cut off evenly, the other end is broken. The entire surface of the preserved part of the tusk is covered by longitudinal saw marks at a distance of 1.5 to 2 cm. from each</page><page sequence="44">44 other. In between the saw marks on this smoothed surface can be seen a geometric design of complex net which is composed of obliquely arranged rhombs. The length of this fragment is about 16 cm. and the thickness is 6.7 cm. (Coll. GIM, 78098/4416). D. A. Krainov also mentions a fragment of bone on which the fine engraved lines depict a portrayal that "recalls a little store house with a conical roof and a covered entry way" (Krainov 19 56:26). A canine of a maral with an opening drilled in the root is the only ornament in this collection (PI. XXXVI: 14, Coll. GIM, 78098/4432). Mention should be made of an unusual object that was made of tubular bird bone on which round openings were placed irregularly. The length of this piece is 6.5 cm. (Coll. GIM, 78098, b/No.). 20. Suponevo Suponevo is located about four km. south of Timonovka and is also situated on the right bank of the Desna River. This site was excavated during the 1920's by P. P. Efimenko, B. S. Zhukov, and V. A. Gorodtsov. Among the bone artifacts found here special mention should be made of a small round object of mammoth ivory (PI. XXXVI: 1, Coll. MA MGU, 346/ 16393). The dimensions are 2.7 X 2 cm. One side has been partially destroyed. According to Shov- koplias, this object represents a piece of an anthro- pomorphic figurine - a head with part of the neck (Shovkoplias 1952:92, PI. IV:6). A series of other artifacts from Suponevo are also deserving of attention. We will proceed with their descriptions. Sculptured Artifact of Bone (PI. XXXVI: 8, Coll. IE, 5081/3). Made from the wall of a tubular bone. Has a leaf-shaped oval form. Both of the flat surfaces have been polished, and the edges have been sharp- ened by means of oblique cuts from both sides. One end is pointed, the other has been broken. The di- mensions of the preserved part are 3.8 X 1.6 cm. In Shovkoplias1 opinion it is the tip of a javelin, but such an assumption seems improbable. Judging by the numerous deliberately drawn hachures on the surface, this object could hardly have had a utili- tarian purpose (Shovkoplias 1952:89, PI. 11:3). Object Made of Bone (PI. XXXVI: 10, Coll. IE, 5081/ 2). It has the appearance of a spatula with a long pointed tang and a widened part. On both of its carefully polished flat surfaces are traces of long hachures which run in various directions. Length, 10.1 cm.; width, 2 cm.; thickness, 0.3 cm. (Shov- koplias 1952:89, PI. 11:2). Fragment of an Object Made of Mammoth Ivory (PI. XXXVI:5, Coll. MA MGU, 346/16367). It has an irregular shape and a round opening near one of its Arctic Anthropology IV-2 ends. The dimensions of this fragment are 3.0 X 1.5 cm. It might possibly have been used as an orna- ment. Flat Plate of Mammoth Ivory (PL XXXVI:2, Coll. IE, 5081/12). It has a subquadrangular form and is only partially preserved. One edge and one end have been broken. There are two holes - one on each corner of the opposite end, but one of the corners here is broken and therefore the edge of one opening is damaged. Both of the flat sides have been thor- oughly polished and rubbed so that the carving (judg- ing by the surviving traces) which once covered the plate can barely be made out on separate areas of the surface. Small mesh work made by carved lines is still intact especially on the facial side. The dimen- sions of the piece are 6 X 2.9 cm. (Shovkoplias 1952: 89, 91, PI. IX: 5). Both the form and the fact that there is an opening on it would indicate that this plate may have been used as an ornament such as a bracelet, buckle, or a clasp to be sewn on the clothing. Fragment of an Object (PI. XXXVI:6, Coll. MA MGU, 346, b/No.). Similar to the previous object. Two corners are still intact, and there is an opening on one of them. The opposite edge is broken. Dimen- sions, 3X3 cm. Fragment of a Plate of Mammoth Ivory (PI. XXXVL3, Coll. MA MGU, 346/16402). It has a narrow, slightly curved shape which indicates that it was possibly a head band. Only a portion of the squared off end with its little round opening has been preserved. Length, 5.1 cm.; width, 0.6 cm. (Shovkoplias 1952:91, PI. 11:11). Thirteen small flat beads made from thin plates of mammoth ivory were found in a hearth in Square 16 of Excavation VIII during the 1927 excavations (PI. XXXVI:4, Coll. MA MGU, 346/16316-16317). They had an irregularly rounded shape with a diameter of nearly 1 cm. There was a round opening in the cen- ter of these beads (Shovkoplias 1952:91, PI. 11:10). Aside from these sculptured objects there are also several fragments, or plates, or mammoth ivory one of which has aroused great interest (PI. XXXVI:9, MA MGU, 346/14436). It is round in section and the thicker end has been hacked off. There are deep longitudinal lines carved on its surface and also a stylized portrayal of two fishes, one of which has been placed on top of the other. The length of this fragment is 12.5 cm. (Shovkoplias 1952:92, PI. II:8). On the smooth surface of a small fragment of mammoth ivory there is a decoration of uneven broken lines which form crude angles and zigzags. The piece measures 5.2 X 3.5 cm. (PI. XXXVI:7, Coll. IE, 5081/4; see Shovkoplias 1952:91, PI. 1:2). The carving on a number of other fragments is less distinct and clearly defined, often consisting of numerous hachures going in various directions (Shovkoplias 1952, PI. 11:4-7).</page><page sequence="45">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 21. Eliseevichi This settlement was discovered by K. M. Poli- karpovich in 1930 and excavated by him in the years that followed. It is situated on the Sudost1 River, a right tributary of the Desna. The remains of well preserved dwellings were revealed over a large area. Special interest was aroused by a de- pression in the ground which was surrounded by large, vertically placed mammoth bones. Alongside this depression was an accumulation of mammoth skulls among which were objects of art - a large sculptured representation of a woman and plates of ivory that were covered with intricate decorative engravings. Female Figurine (PI. XXXVII: 1 , Coll. IE, 5298/2848). This figurine was discovered in 1935; it is made of mammoth ivory and has a height of around 15 cm. It represents a portrayal of a nude woman. The head, arms, and ends of the legs were broken off and lost long ago. The general contours of this figurine con- sist of narrow, sloping shoulders, an elongated torso, narrow waistline, rounded line of the wide hips and thighs, and legs which are smooth and widening (especially in the rounded calves), taper- ing off gradually in the region of the knees. A deep, longitudinal line divides the legs both in front and in back. The legs are stout and massive, especially in the calves. The buttocks are of moderate dimen- sions and rounded outline, passing smoothly into the lines of the legs. Because of the long, drawn out torso, the loose hanging breasts seem small since the abdomen is too far away for them to reach. Deeply incised lines below the abdomen denote the pubic triangle. On the whole, this figurine is dis- tinguished by its elongated proportions and a rather noticeable increase of heaviness in the lower parts (Polikarpovich 1940a: 85, Fig. 2). A large group of Palaeolithic art objects is com- posed of big plates which have been split from mam- moth tusks. Complex geometric designs can be ob- served on their smoothed outer surfaces. Plate of Mammoth Tusk (PI. XXXVII: 5, Coll. IE, 5687/1474). Length, 6 cm.; width, 2.8 cm. Has an oval shape. Only one end has been worked, and apparently it has been broken. Two parallel lines were carved transversely across the plate close to the previously mentioned end. The entire smoothed outer surface as far as these two lines is covered with a design made up of adjoining regular hexa- hedrons. On the reverse side at that same level, there are transverse cuts radiating from a band, and the inner surface is covered with numerous carved lines which have been arranged in a disorderly fashion (Polikarpovich 1940b:287, Fig. 2). Plate of Mammoth Tusk (PI. XXXVII:3, Coll. IE, 5298/2850). Length, 19.1 cm.; width, 5 cm. It has an irregular elongated shape on which there is a 45 carved geometric design on the outer surface. Almost half of the space of the design consists of mesh work, honeycombed in appearance, made of regular hexa- hedrons which become elongated lengthwise near the center of the plate, and terminate with unclosed lines. This mesh work is executed by means of fine clear- cut engravings and occupies an area of 8 X 4.5 cm. The narrow, empty space separates this mesh work from a design of a different kind bordered by a trans- verse line from which radiate fine, closely spaced zigzag short lines. The remaining surface of the plate has not been filled in and only on the very end are there traces of uneven longitudinal lines (Arkheologicheskie Issledovaniia v RSFSR 1941:34, PI. VIII: 1). Plate of Mammoth Ivory (Coll. IE, 5298/2851). Length, 31.5 cm.; width, 7.5 cm. It has an irregular elongated shape. The narrower part of the plate has some exfoliation, but it still bears a carved geo- metric design. Closer to the edge the pattern con- sists of three transverse lines at an angle to which are two parallel lines directed from left to right. Further away there is a wide band of mesh work (up to 4.5 cm. in width) formed by regular hexahedrons and terminating in a cluster of little lines which also go from left to right. Following this cluster, there is a large space filled in with quadrangles of various sizes and shapes and intersected in some instances by transverse hachures. Rows of angular indentations are sometimes seen between the quad- rangles. Plate of Mammoth Ivory (PI. XXXVII:4, Coll. IE, 5298/2855). Length, 28 cm.; width, 7.2 cm. Irregu- lar, crescent shaped in outline. On the smoothed outer surface there is a complex design composed of separate geometric elements - straight parallel lines between which are either transversely perpendicular or oblique cuts, rows of parallel lines that are joined together now from above, now from below, thus form- ing a continuous broken line, rows of parallel zig- zag-like lines, and finally, fascicles of lines drawn in disorderly array. Half way along one edge there is a large chipped area caused by a blow. The in- side surface has traces of working and smoothing (Arkheologicheskie Issledovaniia v RSFSR 1941:34, PI. VIII: 3). Plate of Mammoth Ivory (PI. XXXV:5, Coll. IE, 5298/ 2859). Length, 14.2 cm.; width, 5.4 cm.; thickness, 0.7 cm. It has an irregular shape close that of an oval. Both surfaces have been smoothed out and decorated. On the outer convex side various ele- ments form a complex pattern. In the middle of the plate, lengthwise along it, rows of thin, parallel zig- zag-like lines are divided into sectors by means of transverse double lines. Over this pattern there are rows of oblique parallel lines, and to the right of it there are some curious horseshoe-shaped signs made up of double broken lines. In one instance, the space</page><page sequence="46">46 between these rows of oblique lines is filled in with short transverse cuts. Partially effaced thin zig- zags separated by transverse lines can also be seen on the edge of the slab. Individual lines arranged in twos and threes or in short rows were arranged in empty places. An indeterminate composition con- sisting of longitudinal transverse and oblique lines can be traced on the inner side (Polikarpovich 1940a: 84, Fig. 1). Plate of Mammoth Ivory (PI. XXXVII: 6, Coll. IE, 5298/2852). Length, 13.3 cm.; greatest width, 3.5 cm.; length of decorated band, 4.5 cm. It has a drawn out, irregular shape. Traces of a design have been preserved on the outer convex side. In the center and a little closer to the narrow end there is a design composed of rows of parallel zigzag-shaped lines which are separated by two pairs of double transverse lines. Apparently the latter were carved in first since between the double lines there is no decoration. The center of the plate has no decora- tive design, and it is only on the wider end that one appears again in the form of uneven lines going in various directions. There are some transverse hachures preserved on the inner side (Arkheo- logicheskie Issledovaniia v RSFSR 1941, PI. VIII: 2). Plate of Mammoth Ivory (Coll. IE, 5298/2853). Lengthy 23.4 cm.; width, 7.3 cm. Irregular in outline. There are traces of a decorative design on both the outer and inner sides of this plate. Along the smoothed rounded edge of the outer side there are short zigzag-shaped lines which are separated from the remaining surface by a transverse line. Perpen- dicular to the latter are three pairs of longitudinal lines placed at equal distances from each other, and bordered on the opposite side by a double transverse line. Placed perpendicularly to the lower longitudi- nal band are three pairs of short lines, the space in between them being filled with oblique parallel lines. Rows of hachures directed toward one side or another can be traced over the remainder of the surface. Both longitudinal and transverse hachures were applied on the inner side. Plate of Mammoth Ivory (Coll. IE, 5298/2932). Length, 19.5 cm.; width, 5.4 cm. It has irregular outlines. 'Traces of deep indentations have been preserved on one of its edges. There are longitudi- nal and transverse and sometimes doubled hachures on the convex surface. In addition to these places there were also discovered more massive fragments of ivory, the surfaces of which also had traces of geometric de- signs. We shall first of all take into consideration the following four fragments. End of Mammoth Tusk (PI. XXXV:4, Coll. IE, 5298/ 2857). Length, 27.5 cm.; width, 6.8 cm. It is well preserved. On the smoothed surface of the ivory there are traces of various elements of a rectilinear Arctic Anthropology IV-2 design: parallel rows of zigzag-shaped lines, long longitudinal and transverse lines from which short parallel gashes radiate, and so on. Fragment of Mammoth Ivory (PI. XXXVII:2, Coll. IE, 5687/1477). Length, 21.3 cm.; width, 8.3 cm. It has a nondescript shape. On the convex outer surface various elements of design have been preserved in the form of rows of short parallel zigzag-like lines and long, narrow, closed rectangles which were also placed parallel to each other (Polikarpovich 1940b: 286, Fig. 1). Fragment of Mammoth Ivory (Coll. IE, 5687/1479). Dimensions of the fragment, 17.7X4.7 cm. Elon- gated in outline. On its outer smoothed side were engraved parallel rows of straight double lines and also some hachures arranged in a disorderly fashion. Fragment of Mammoth Ivory (Coll. IE, 5298/2872). Length, 10.5 cm.; width, 8 cm. Short and thick. There is an engraved design on the surface in the form of double bands made up of thin carved lines which are sometimes intersected by short transverse cuts. Clusters of parallel lines also appear. On certain artifacts the design is composed of straight transverse cuts on some of the objects. End Fragment of Mammoth Ivory (Coll. IE, 5298/ 2927). The length of the end piece of this tusk is 64 cm. and its width is 6 cm. This piece is covered over entirely with parallel transverse cuts (38 in all) which were placed at varying intervals from one another. Fragment of a Mammoth Rib (Coll. IE, 5298/2867). Length, 36.5 cm.; width, 2.8 cm.; thickness, 2 cm. It has an elongated flat shape and has been worked and polished along the edges. On the flat outer sur- face across the width of the rib are transverse paral- lel cuts which form a band made of three lines. In the space between these bands along the middle line of the surface are short, but deeply engraved cuts which are also transversely placed. Fragment of an Animal Rib (Coll. IE, 5687/1455). Length, 10.8 cm.; width, 2 cm. Has traces of cutting on one end and breakage of the other. Five deep transverse cuts were made at different intervals from one another on the surface of this rib. There are, in addition to these, upwards of twenty- five fragments of plates of mammoth ivory in this col- lection - nondescript in outline with varying cuts on the surface which spread out in various directions and do not form any specific element of design. There is another special group comprised of rather small plates of mammoth ivory having trimmed edges and polished flat surfaces, and which, to all appearances, represent fragments of some sort of artifact (Coll. IE, 5687/1483 and others). Outstand- ing among these is a finished object in the form of a thin quadrangular plate with a round opening in the center. No doubt it served as an ornament (Coll. IE, 5687/1494).</page><page sequence="47">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. Also worth noting are punches made from tubular bones of small animals; the epiphyses had been cut off. Short transverse cuts can be seen in some places on the surface. The same kind of cuts can be observed on entire tubular bones of the polar fox (Coll. IE, 5687/1446, 1486, and others). 22. Kirillovskaia This site is located on the right bank of the Dnepr River in the city of Kiev. During the course of the excavations, 1893-1896, V. V. Khvoiko found two pieces of mammoth tusk with simple designs on their surfaces in the lower cultural level here. The first fragment has a length of 21 cm. and a diameter of 4.5 cm. (PI. XXXVIII: 2; see Beliashev- skii 1900:71, Fig. between pages 72 and 73). Closer to the narrow end there is a slightly curved line from which twenty-three cuts extend perpendicularly. These tiny cuts are located at various intervals from one another and are inclined in various directions. The second fragment of tusk has almost the same measurements: length, 21.5 cm.; diameter (at its widest extent), 6 cm. On one side there are two engraved lines which are almost parallel with a length of 7-7.4 cm., and between them are eight short transverse lines which extend off of one of the longitudinal lines but do reach over to the other one (Beliashevskii 1900:71, Fig. between pages 72 and 73). At a distance of 120 meters from the main ex- cavations of the lower horizon and 21 m. from the surface in a stratum which to all appearances cor- responds to the previously mentioned lower horizon, the famous Kirillovskaia tusk with its intricate ornamental design was discovered along with other finds (PI. XXXVIII: 1). This is the pointed end of the tusk and has a length of 30 cm. The convex side shows traces of chipping, and there are a number of scratches on the flat surface. The engraved design covering the tusk is both original and intricate (PI. XXXIX: 1). The investigators regard it as the portrayal of some kind of figures, possibly a bird and tortoise. Together with these figures there are wavy parallel lines, zigzags, and elongated curved lines filled with transversely placed, slightly arched lines. The entire drawing does not follow the con- tour of the tusk, and it is very likely that it was not intended merely as a decoration, but rather pos- sessed some subtle significance of meaning which for us remains obscure (Volkov 1903). 23-24. Dubovaia and Kaistro vaia Ravines Individual objects of adornment were found at Late Palaeolithic sites of Nadporozh'ia: in Dubovaia 47 Ravine, bored shells of marine mollusks and an ani- mal tooth cut off at the root; a shell and a piece of amber with traces of working on it at Kaistrovaia Ravine (Boriskovskii 1953:380, 383). Individual specimens of Palaeolithic art have been found in other Palaeolithic sites in the Ukraine. 25. Gontsy The Gontsy settlement is situated on the right bank of the Udai River, a tributary of the Sula River. It was excavated during the course of several sea- sons by numerous researchers. Some curious objects made of mammoth ivory were discovered here at the time of the 1914-1915 excavations. One of them was a shaft with a rounded head and with decorative grooves on both the upper and middle parts (PI. XXXIX:4; see Boriskovskii 1953, Fig. 167:2). There was also a somewhat puzzling object with an oval form and elongated ends, one of which had been rounded, the other broken (PI. XXXIX: 5). In the center of the latter artifact there was a drilled round hole of large diameter (Gorodtsov 1926: 31, PI. V, Fig. 43). Boriskovskii describes it in de- tail: "It stands alone, part of a unique work made of mammoth ivory, tapering on both ends and widen- ing in the middle, through which there is a round opening with a diameter of about 1 cm. But the dimensions of this work, described by some as the head of a mace, are considerably less than those of the Late Palaeolithic batons which served as straight - eners for spear shafts or for stropping thongs. It would be more plausible to classify it along with the large awls and needles with eyelets of the type found in Mezin" (Boriskovskii 1953:323-324, Fig. 167:3). Among the other works of art worth noting are the fragments of mammoth ivory with cuts on them. One of these was discovered in a food storage pit close to a semi-subterranean dwelling (PI. XXXIX: 2). Along the length of this object is a finely en- graved, slightly curved line from which lines of various lengths extend at right angles - one of greater length, then a few shorter ones, then again a longer one, and so on. There are 32 long lines, 78 short lines. The engraving does not follow the contours of the tusk, and as Boriskovskii has cor- rectly observed, it not only served as a decorative design, but may also have had some kind of a mean- ing (Boriskovskii 1953:324, Fig. 168). The second piece is the end of a young mam- moth1 s tusk. Length, 36 cm.; diameter, 4.5 cm. On the convex side close to the sharp end of the tusk some thin cuts arranged in a haphazard fashion, sometimes double vertical parallel lines intersected by oblique hachures. I. F. Levitskii thinks that this object resembles the phallic carving from the Timonov i site (Levitskii 1947:221, Fig. 10).</page><page sequence="48">48 Two flat bone plates with a shape approximating that of a square were found in 1935. One of them was decorated by thin cuts (Levitskii 1947: 223). Among the ornaments found at the Gontsy Site mention was made of animal teeth. Part of a bear's jaw was found with a drilled hole on it, and a ca- nine still intact (PI. XXXIX:3; see Boriskovskii 1953, Fig. 167:6). There was also a piece of a pendant made of a bear's canine with deep ring-like cuts (Levitskii 1947:224), the tooth of a ruminating ani- mal with two concentric cuts (Briusov 1940:90), and the canine of a wolf without openings or cuts, but with evidence of a definite gloss caused by pro- longed handling (Gorodtsov 1926:31-32, PI. V, Fig. 44). 26. Klinets A fragment of a mammoth tusk decorated with the herringbone pattern and individual straight lines was found in 19 54 in the village of Klinets, Ovruch District, located in the northern part of Zhitomir Province (PI. XL:1). In 1955 a Palaeolithic site was discovered here, and it was from this location evi- dently that the tusk was found (Mesiats 1956:40- 42). 27. Amvrosievka In a cultural level at this site (Donbass, in the basin of the Mius River) Boriskovskii found indi- vidual objects which can be classified as ornaments: four flat miniature beads made from the fossilized segments of sea lilies (PI. XXXIX: 7-10), a shell (Cardium), and a stone pendant. The latter is quite massive, round and flat, with a drilled opening asymmetrically placed closer to one edge. The diameter of the pendant is 2.6 cm., and of the open- ing, 0.9 cm. (PI. XXXIX:6; see Boriskovskii 1953: 361, Fig. 192). A shell, Ceritium, was found in the peripheral area of this site (Boriskovskii 19 53:340, Fig. 180). 28. Iakimovskaia Ravine (Rogalik) At the Rogalik Site, Lugansk Province, a pen- dant made from a piece of an animal rib was found. Its length was 5 cm., and it had a drilled hole. There was also a fragment of a tubular bone with its epiphyses still intact and traces of parallel circu- lar cuts (PI. XXXIX: 19), several small shells with openings in them (PI. XXXIX: 11 -13, 15-18), and the vertebra of a fish which had been drilled in the cen- ter (PL XXXIX: 14; see Loktiushov 1947:286, Fig. 2). Arctic Anthropology IV-2 29. Il'skaia Among the discoveries at this site, which is lo- cated in the basin of the Kuban River, V. A. Gorodtsov made note of eight bone objects: three fragments of tubular bones with some evidence that the surface had been rubbed down, and five pieces of bone plates with polished surfaces. One of the latter had been carefully worked, and according to the hypothesis of Gorodtsov, it might represent part of an ornament ("breast gorget") (PI. XL:2). Crosses and lines can be seen on its surface which apparently were not engraved by accident. The measurements of this plate are 5.5 X 3.4 cm. (Gorodtsov 1941:22, Figs. 7-9). 30. Molodova V This settlement is situated on the right bank of the Dnestr River in the village of Molodova, Chern- ovtsy Province. It was discovered by A. P. Chernysh in 1948, and explored by him in the following years. Twelve cultural levels were revealed here - from the Mousterian down to the Mesolithic. We shall exam- ine the art objects by levels, beginning with the up- per one. In Horizon 1-a a harpoon made of antler was found, on whose surface was engraved a fine design in the form of zigzag-like, transversely placed bands and rows of small, oblique parallel cuts (PI. XL:3; see Chernysh 1956a: 152, Fig. 70:2). In the second horizon an object made of reindeer antler was found having a length of 19.5 cm. and a diameter of 1.4 cm. There is an opening cut through which extends lengthwise down the center of the article, plus small openings on the sides. The ar- rangement of the holes and the general form of this article, in Chernysh1 s opinion, indicates that it is an ancient musical instrument, a type of flute. Lines placed at an angle form a herringbone pattern on the surface around the base of the antler (Chernysh 1956a:151, Fig. 170:1). An object made of limestone was discovered in the third horizon, which in its general outlines re- sembles a female figurine. It apparently has been in acid soil, but, nevertheless, the head which looks as though it is hunched down into the shoulders, the full loose hanging breasts, and the shapely thighs can easily be observed. The abdomen and back have been damaged by wide facets. The height of this object is 9 cm.; the width, 3.2 cm.; and the thick- ness, 2.3 cm.* In this same level an interesting The existence of this object and its resem- blance to a female figurine was pointed out to us by A. N. Rogachev.</page><page sequence="49">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. sculptured object was found in the form of a round shaft (diameter, 1.6 cm.) with a pointed end and with a projection like a handle on the opposite end (PI. XL: 10). It is possible that this is the very ob- ject Chernysh had in mind when he referred to the discovery in the third level of a "... schematized anthropomorphic figurine made of ivory (dimensions, 95 X 15 X 15 cm.), with the shape of a conical shaft" (Chernysh 1959a:53). A hollow shaft of reindeer antler was found in the fourth horizon. Its dimensions are: height, 21 cm.; width, 1.3 cm.; thickness, l.Z cm.; and diam- eter of the opening, 0.5 cm. Four openings, placed in a row, are located on the narrower end, and on the opposite end there are two more. These distinc- tive features enabled Chernysh to make the asser- tion that this object represents a musical instrument, a type of flute (Chernysh 1955:129-130, Fig. 54). The canine of a polar fox with an opening in it was also found at this site (PI. XL: 8), plus a shell, Pectunculus, which- has a hole through it for suspen- sion (PI. XL: 9). A large slate slab was recovered from the sixth horizon. It has a semi-oval form, lenticular-shaped section, and triangular-shaped notches along its edge (PI. XL: 16). The dimensions of this slab are: length, 8 cm.; width, 6.5 cm.; thickness, 1.4 cm. (Chernysh 1957a:53). The seventh horizon was especially rich in in- teresting objects. Five "batons" made of deer antler, lying side by side, were found in 1955. They all have the same shape - an elongated shaft which terminates in a big head in which there is a drilled opening of considerable diameter (Chernysh 1959a, Fig. 16). On the surface of one of these "batons" there is a design made up of several rows of fine parallel cut lines, and at the same time there is also a por- trayal of a human being, en face , done in low relief (PI. XL: 5). The outlines of the head, neck, body and right leg can be seen distinctly. One can also make out the eyes, represented by two little hollows, 49 a small projection in place of a nose, and some short vertical lines which were apparently intended to portray hair. The dimensions of the "baton" are: height, 30.5 cm.; width, 3.2 cm.; thickness, 2.5 cm.; dimensions of the representation are: length, 13.5 cm.; width, 2.7 cm. (Chernysh 1957b: 133-134). Three thin sandstone disks with polished sur- faces also were found at this level (PI. XL: 13-15). There was an opening which had been drilled from two sides on one of them. The diameters of the disks are: 5.7 and 7.5 cm.; and the thickness ranges up to 0.6 cm. (Chernysh 1957a: 15). There was also a very unique piece of sandstone slab on which were bands painted a bright red extending radially. The canine of a polar fox drilled at the root (PI. XL: 11) and three different shells are among the ornaments worthy of note. One of these shells is small, of a type not unlike Neritina, but more thick walled, and it has an oval opening on it which was apparently drilled. The second shell looks like the common garden variety of snail, but it too has thicker walls. It has a carved opening and two shallow cuts side by side. The third shell is of a type similar to Cardium and it has a hole - cut on one side, drilled on the other. Cuts can be observed along the frac- ture (PI. XL: 12). A pendant made of mammoth ivory was found in the eighth horizon. It has a semi-oval form with a projecting ear. Its upper wall was broken off, but clearly visible are traces of a round opening (PI. XL: 6). A shell (Cardium ) with an opening on it was also found at this level (PI. XL: 7). 31. Lisichniki The site of Lisichniki is located on the right bank of the Seret River. Fossil shells with holes on them were discovered here, as well as a fragment of a belemnite which had a deep notch on it to serve as the place of attachment (Boriskovskii 1953:131). THE CRIMEA AND CAUCASUS Works of art in the Palaeolithic sites of the Crimea and Caucasus are not only of a simple form, but they are few in number as well. They add up to certain kinds of ornaments of natural origin and some decorated pieces of bone and antler. There are the usual drilled animal teeth, including fossilized teeth of the shark. 32. Siuren' Siuren1 is located about thirteen kilometers southwest of the city of Bakhchisarai. Three bone pendants were found in the lower cultural horizon. One of them was made of a rather small piece of tubular bone and has the form of an irregular trape- zoid with a length of 3.5 cm. and a width of 7 cm. (PI. XLI:2). Close to the right hand edge of the upper base of the trapezoid there is an opening of regular cylindrical form with a diameter of 1 mm. The bone in this area has been flattened and the entire surface oí the pendant was smoothed. Two small flat pieces of bone with deep notches for attachment may also have been used as pendants (PI. XLI:7). A fourth ob- ject made of antler has four hollows placed at ran-</page><page sequence="50">50 dom; the upper end of the article was smoothed (Velikova 1957:300, Fig. 31:2, 7). Several fragments of bone have a rhythmical arrangement of cuts and incisions. The cuts on one of these bone fragments might be regarded as an unfinished drawing (PI. XLI:1). There are two curved lines on its surface which form an oval with both ends open, and alongside the lower line there is still another curved line. In some places these lines bifurcate. There are two small cuts on the right hand side. Length, 8.5 cm.; width, 1.7 cm. (Velikova 1957:301, Fig. 31:1). Shells having an opening punched in them and which had had their spiny outgrowths removed were used as ornaments. Six shells belonging to an ex- tinct species of marine mollusks (Apporhais pes- pelicani) found around the Black Sea at the end of the Tertiary Period (PI. XLI:3 4) were used for this purpose as was a river mollusk, Taeodoxus fluvia- tilis (Bonch-Osmolovokskii 1934:153, PI. V:9; Velikova 1957:300, Fig. 31:3, 4). We might also mention a piece of antler of the red deer which was found in the upper cultural level of Siuren1 I (PI. XLI:5). It has a length of 8 cm., and a width of 3.5 cm. with one tine broken off. The remaining cone-like part of the tine as well as the flatter surface of the antler itself has a design on it consisting of several curved lines and four rows of short rhythmically placed cuts (Bonch-Osmolov- skii 1934:154, PI. VI: 1). In Velikova1 s estimation this design represents part of some kind of a sche- matic drawing (Velikova 1957:302-303, Fig. 31:5). Besides this the incisor of a red deer was found here. It had a drilled opening and was broken off on the upper part (PI. XLI:6). A pendant made of a beaver incisor was also found (Bonch-Osmolovskii 1934:153, PI. VI:2). In Siuren' II pieces of bone were discovered on which were some parallel cuts, but they were per- haps not intended as a decorative motif (Bonch- Osmolovskii 1934:162). 33. Shan-Koba The lower level of the Shan-Koba cave also yielded pieces of bone with parallel cuts and drilled teeth of the red deer (PI. XLI:8-11; see Bonch- Osmolovskii 1934:162). S. N. Bibikov mentions two discoveries that had decorative patterns on them: a piece of an animal skull (length, 5 cm.; width, 3.3 cm.) was decorated with three fairly deep paral- lel lines and one oblique notch (Bibikov 1936:210, Fig. 7:d [Russian letter], and the bone mounting of a possible knife shaped like a shaft (length, 8.5 cm.; width, 1.1 cm.) with a deep slot on it plus the very simple decorative designs on the surface. The lat- ter consists of three shallow rectilinear grooves Arctic Anthropology IV-2 placed parallel to one another in three's, thereby forming three rows of bands (Bibikov 1936:206-207, Fig. 7a). A similar design on a bone knife was found in the Cave of Murzak-Koba. It was lying by the right hand of Skeleton No. 1 (Bibikov 1940:175). 34. Balin-Kosh A few decorated objects were found at this site. A water-smoothed pebble (PI. XII: 14; see Gelakh 1933) and three somewhat oblong pieces of argillace- ous slate were decorated by a pattern made up of fine lines, parallel gashes, and irregular zigzags (PI. XLI:12, 13, 15; see Bader 1940:97, Fig. 4). 35. Mgvimevi Specimens of art in the Palaeolithic sites of the Caucasus are just as rare an occurrence as they are in the Crimea. For this reason the only traces of wall engravings found in caves in the U.S.S.R. have acquired special recognition. In 1934 Zamiatnin dis- covered and studied the rectilinear tracings on the walls of cave shelters in Mgvimevi, Western Georgia (PI. XLII:1). These tracings have suffered great dam- age but according to Zamiatnin' s own words (1937: 70) "... even in their original state . . . they did not represent realistic portrayals, but rather had the ap- pearance of schematic signs of a linear-geometric character. " The caves in which the engravings were found also contained traces of the culture of Palaeolithic man. The engravings themselves also pertain to Palaeolithic times. "Part of them were covered over by a thin stalagmitic crust, and lower down along the slope there is a large accumulation which con- tains as an inclusion within it, flint tools, and split bones belonging to the Palaeolithic period" (Zamiatnin 1937:69). With a number of undoubted examples, Zamiatnin also illustrates the fact that the tracings of Mgvimevi bear a close resemblance to the Palaeo- lithic engravings found in the western part of the Mediterranean Sea - the Romanelli Cave of Italy, and the rock shelter of Foum Bir Seid, or the shelter at Mount Kifene, the latter two both being located in North Africa near the City of Tebessa. 36. Sagvardzhile A bone awl was found in this cave which, in Kiladze's opinion, represents a sculptured portrayal of a fish (PI. XLII:2). Various pendants made of talc were also found here (PI. XLII:3-6), in addition to nineteen drilled shells of the marine mollusk,</page><page sequence="51">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. Turritella duplicata (PI. XLII:7, 8; see Kiladze 1953:566). 37. Gvardzhilas -Klde A fragment of a bone tool of a type similar to the "baton de commandment" was discovered at this site (PI. XLII:9). On each of the two sur- faces there are seven rather deeply etched figures which resemble arrows or "double pointed spears" (see Tushabramishvili 1955:11-12). Fragments of bone objects decorated by cuts (PI. XLII:10, 11) and the drilled teeth of animals were also found here (PI. XLII:12, 13; see Zamiatnin 1957:499, Fig. 26). 38. Sakazhia A fragment of a tubular bone was found in this cave on which there were traces of painted lines, 51 apparently of an ornamental nature (PI. XLII:15; see Zamiatnin 1957:478). 39. Taro -Klde The tip of a javelin found in this cave had four parallel cuts near its base which probably were in- tended as a decoration (PI. XIII: 14; see Zamiatnin 1957:462). 40. Uvarova Cave There were three parallel oblique cuts on the wide end of a javelin which was discovered in this cave (Zamiatnin 1957:480). 41. Devis-Khvreli The tooth of a deer with deep cuts for suspen- sion was found in this cave (Nioradze 1934:229). SIBERIA AND THE URALS 42. Irkutsk Hospital In 18 71 during the construction of a military hospital in Irkutsk (located on the right bank of the Ushakovka River) some artifacts made of mammoth ivory were unearthed. The place where the discovery was made was explored by the well known geolo- gist, I. D. Cherskii. He established the fact that these objects were lying at a depth of 2.1 m. from the surface in a level of loess-like loam in an un- disturbed situation, and dated them as belonging to the Palaeolithic Epoch. All this material was de- stroyed in the fire at the Irkutsk Museum in 1879, and it is possible to pass judgment on it only on the basis of the drawings and descriptions left by Cherskii. The first thing he refers to are the short cylin- drical shafts made of mammoth ivory which taper from both ends toward the middle where there is a round opening that was drilled from both sides. These shafts are girdled by four bands, each one of which is made up of engraved concentric lines. The length of the best preserved specimen is 7 cm. , the diameter of the ends is 3.5 cm., and the diam- eter of the middle part is 3 cm. (PI. XLIII:1). Judging by the fragments there should have been about five whole specimens in all (Cherskii 1872:168, Fig. 1; Uvarov 1881, Vol. 1:233 and Vol. II, PI. 1, 41). Rings of various diameters were included among the number of discoveries made here. They are made of mammoth ivory, their thin rims being around 8 mm. in height, and having a thickness of between 3.5 to 4 mm. Some of them were found linked to- gether (Cherskii 1872:168). Cherskii also describes a "ball" made of mam- moth ivory which to all appearances had a flattened ellipsoidal form, and a diameter of from 4.5 to 5 cm. In spite of the poor preservation of this article, one is still able to trace on Cherskii1 s illustration the design of rows of parallel lines arranged in groups of three's and going in various directions (PI. XLIII: 2; see Cherskii 1872:168, Fig. 2). Besides this a few fragments of artifacts made of mammoth ivory were unearthed: a spindle-shaped object about 4.5 cm. in length whose surface bears traces of a design consisting of fine transverse en- graved lines (PI. XLIII:4; see Cherskii 1872:168, Fig. 3); a fragment of a thin plate on which there is a drilled hole (width, 0.8 cm.; thickness, 0.4 cm.) (see Cherskii 1872:168, Fig. 4); and fragments of objects of cylindrical shape with rounded tops, taper- ing off to a neck on the opposite end on which traces of an opening can be seen in some instances (PI. XLIII: 3). A design made up of concentric carved lines can be observed on the surface of the fragments. The fragments have a diameter of 2.4 cm., and up to 1.2 cm. on the neck; height of the fragments is about 2 cm. (Cherskii 1872:168, Fig. 6). Cherskii describes the artifacts from this site as follows: "All the things listed here are extraordi- narily fragile, distinguishable by their lightness, firmly stick to the tongue, and are overlaid with black splotches occasionally of a dendritic pattern. Their surfaces are well polished, without the least evidence</page><page sequence="52">52 of having been water worn; the edges of the above mentioned heads have been rounded out to perfec- tion resembling lathe-turned work; and all these same things, with the exception of the rings, are decorated with symmetrical groupings of parallel ring shaped furrows." There are eight canines of the red deer with drilled holes which belong to this same collection (Cherskii 1872: 168). Petri (1923:24-28) expressed doubts about the Palaeolithic age assigned to these articles, but we are in complete agreement with G. P. Sosnovskii (1934:270-271) who thinks that the Cherskii col- lection "... ought to be placed in the Upper Palaeo- lithic Era, and not to its late period, but rather to its first half. " 43. Verkholenskaia Gora This stratified settlement lies within the out- skirts of Irkutsk below the confluence of the Usha- kovka and Angara Rivers. Despite the presence of some first-rate bone harpoons and other artifacts made of bone, very few works of art were found here. Pendants are referred to in the literature: Gromov ( 1948:370, Fig. 88:2, 3) speaks of pendants of agalimatolite'1* made in imitation of the canines of the maral and having holes in them for suspension (PI. XLIII:5, 6), and Petri (1923:44) tells of a small pendant made of steatite shaped like a somewhat flattened pyramid and having an opening in its up- per part. Since Petri did not reproduce the pendant, it is difficult to decide whether he is referring to it or another one. In regard to ornamental design he wrote this: "The only evidence of the existence of any design seems to be a very simple pattern con- sisting of dashes found on one of the antler awls" (Petri 1923:44). 44. MaVta This settlement is located on the left bank of the Belaia River, a tributary of the Angara, eighty- five kilometers below Irkutsk. It was discovered in 1928 and' explored in the subsequent years by M. M. Gerasimov. Dwelling complexes were found here which yielded extraordinarily rich art produc- tions of a varied genre. The work on this site was Agalmatolite is a soft stone of considerable density, with colors ranging from muted grays, greens to yellows. Its name is also applied to pinite, steatite, and pyrophylite varieties. The Chi- nese have reportedly used it for carving since an- cient times. (Trans.) Arctic Anthropology IV-2 resumed in 1956 resulting in remarkable new dis- coveries. FEMALE FIGURINES. At the present time about thirty female figurines have been found in Mal'ta. Figurine No. 1 (PI. XLIV: 1 and XLV: 1 , Coll. GE, OIPK 370/746). Found in 1928 in Excavation B. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 8.7 cm.; width, 2.2 cm. This figurine represents the figure of a nude woman. It had been smashed into a mass of frag- ments and was lying under a large slab of limestone together with pieces of a shaft which was decorated with crescent-shaped cuts. With the exception of the lower part of the legs, however, none of this figurine is missing. It has a strictly frontal pose, and it has been markedly flattened lengthwise. The head is disproportionately large, but is well shaped. There is a broad, flat face with carved lines that reproduce the eyebrows and nose distinctly framed by a projecting head; at least insofar as the head is covered by long wavy lines one may assume that luxuriant hair was reproduced in that manner. The head is separated from the body by a carved line. Narrow shoulders and rather small loose hanging breasts are portrayed in low relief; the abdomen is round but not bulging, the hips are tilted upwards in an exaggerated manner, and the buttocks are sep- arated from the remaining part of the back by a curved line running along the waist. The arms are thin and are shown resting on the abdomen; no hands can be traced. Long legs which are divided by a deep groove form an inverted cone. There is an oblique deep dash on the lower part of the abdomen (Gerasi- mov 1931:19, PI. 12:a). Figurine No. 2 (PI. XLIV:5, Coll. GE OIPK, 370/749). Found in a dwelling in 1929 in Excavation I. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 5.5 cm.; width, 2.8 cm. This figurine was put together from forty- seven pieces; it was not preserved in its entirety - the head, which is missing, was apparently broken off and lost long ago. There are fairly wide sloping shoulders, rather small loose-hanging breasts which are portrayed in faint relief, a somewhat small but swollen abdomen, and the wide hips with buttocks clearly separated at the back all convey the char- acteristic features of a plump woman. The arms, tightly pressed to the body, are clearly designated, and the hands, which repose on the abdomen, are shown by means of a small raised area. The legs terminate on a rounded extremity and are separated by a wide embrasure on the lower part of which there is a round hole (Gerasimov 1931:19-20, PI. 12:b). Figurine No. 3 (Pis. XLVII: 1 , Coll. GE, OIPK, 3 70/ 752). Found in 1929 on the floor of a dwelling in Excavation I together with Figurine No. 2. The ma- terial is mammoth ivory. Height, 4.4 cm.; width, 1.1 cm. This figurine represents a miniature portrayal of a woman entirely covered, except for the face,</page><page sequence="53">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. with crescent-shaped cuts. This design conceals the details of the figurine, but nevertheless the disproportionately large head ( l/3 of the entire length of the figurine) is easily distinguished. The eyes and nose were carved in on the wide, flat face, and the massive chin stands out clearly. The re- maining surface of the head, which stretches upward in the shape of a cone, is covered by straight rows of crescent-shaped cuts. Breasts are not indicated, but the broad pelvis is hoisted upwards consider- ably as was the case with the previous figurines. The arms, closely pressed to the body, are faintly outlined, and the legs, which are not separated, have a round opening in the middle part. Orderly rows of crescent-shaped cuts cover the backs and thighs, their sharp ends turned downwards. There are small round cuts on the breasts placed in oblique rows. These cuts are arranged somewhat chaoti- cally on the abdomen and legs, but perhaps this can be explained by the fact that there has been some obliteration of the design on these areas (Gerasi- mov 1931:20, PI. 13:a; 1935:85, Fig. 5). Figurine No. 4 (Pis. XLIV:4 and XLVII:9, Coll. GE, OIPK, 3 70/755). Found in 1929 inside a dwelling not far from a hearth (Excavations I-V). The ma- terial is mammoth ivory. Height, 9.6 cm.; width, 1.1 cm. This figurine represents a schematic por- trayal of a human being in the form of a shaft which is round in section and topped by a perfectly exe- cuted head. Longitudinal lines portray the legs on the lower end. The spherical head (diameter, 1.6 cm.) has a clearly defined, rather narrow face. The eyes (orbital arches), flat straight nose, mouth, and round chin are also well defined. A projecting headdress frames the face. In the center of the head from the forehead to the occiput there is a clear-cut line which forms a sort of "part" in the hair. Wavy lines, radiating from the face in a fan- like formation, meet each other on the occiput where two rows of pits (about 8 or 9 in all) go lengthwise along the "part." The body is devoid of details ex- cept for sharp lines that mark off the border between the legs and abdomen. These lines, however, form excessively long sides of a triangle, and it may be that they are the result of longitudinal cracks in the ivory. The end of the joined legs is rounded. When viewed in profile, a faint projection of the thighs can be noticed, and it gives one the impres- sion that the figurine is slightly tilted forward (Gerasimov 1931:20-21, PI. 13:b). Figurine No. 5 (Pis. XLIV:9 and XLV:2, Coll. GE, OIPK, 3 70/750). Found in 1929 in a dwelling (Exca- vations I-V) 60 cm. from a hearth in a small depres- sion together with Figurines Nos. 6 and 7 and other objects. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 5.3 cm.; width, 2.3 cm. This figurine was found in a broken condition, but it was collected in full. It represents a nude woman of normal proportions. 53 The head with its found, flat face is easily distin- guished. The details of the face were not filled in except for a hollow on the right side which looks as though there was an unsuccessful attempt to make an eye. Orderly rows of crescent-shaped cuts cover the remainder of the head. The breasts are not desig- nated and the arms which are tightly pressed to the body are shown clearly in relief with the lower parts reposing on a somewhat bulging abdomen. The ex- panded pelvic region is shown in wide relief and the thighs, which have smooth outlines in the upper part, abruptly taper downwards. The legs are separated from the abdomen by a sharp line that comes together at an angle at the top of which is evidence of the beginning of drilling. On the reverse side of the figurine there is a carved line across the thighs which separates the buttocks from the legs; the lat- ter are divided by a deep wide furrow. When seen in profile this figurine has the appearance of being inclined forward (Gerasimov 1931:21, PI. 13:c). Figurine No. 6 (PI. XLIV:8 and XLV:4, Coll. GE, OIPK, 370/751). Found in 1929 in a dwelling together with figurines Nos. 5 and 7. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 6.8 cm.; width, 1.5 cm. Represents the completed portrayal of a nude woman. The huge head is clearly separated from the body and has the same diameter as the latter. The face with its asym- metrically placed eyes and nose is framed by a pro- jecting headdress. Straight carved lines along the sides of the head and on part of the occiput region portray hair falling downwards. The arms are closely pressed to the body, the lower parts resting on the abdomen. The legs, separated both in front and in back by a deep wide groove which does not extend all the way down, are rounded off on the bottom. The buttocks extend up high in the back, but when seen in profile the outline is smooth, and they do not jut out on the sides at all. Deep carved lines are used to portray the breasts pendant on the flat torso. In profile this figurine has a considerably better appearance than it does en face (Gerasimov 1931:21, PI. 14:a). Figurine No. 7 (Pis. XLIV:7 and XLV:3, Coll. GE, OIPK, 370/754). Found in 1929 in the dwelling to- gether with Figurines Nos. 5 and 6. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 8.5 cm.; width, 1.8 cm.; thickness, 1 cm. It represents a woman's figure with the usual trinomial division and is devoid of small details. The head which is almost of the same size as the thorax is set off from the flat face by a faintly expressed headdress. The breast and abdomen are also flat and the arms are slightly out- lined along the sides. Deep grooves coming together at an angle mark the contours of the lower part of the abdomen, and in front the legs are similarily divided by a deep and fairly wide (up to 2 mm.) fur- row. On the reverse side the legs are also divided by a deep furrow, but in this instance it does not</page><page sequence="54">54 extend all the way down to the bottom. In spite of the general flat appearance of this figurine, the but- tocks, as with all the others, are set up high (Gera- simov 1931:21, PI. 14: b). Figurine No. 8 (Pis. XLV:6 and XLVI: 1 ., Coll. GE, OIPK, 370/747). Found in 1929. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 13.6 cm.; width, 2.6 cm. Represents a portrayal of a nude woman and is dis- tinguished by an imbalance in proportions: The head and torso are almost of equal size, and the legs are about three times as long as the torso. In spite of the finished look of this figurine on the whole the face is distinguished from the remainder of the head in that it has no details at all. The headdress stands out in high relief, but does not frame the face like an oval fillet as is usually the case, but rather frames it in this instance by a rec- tangle. The crown is smooth, but below this it covers the head entirely by wavy lines. It seems to be clipped straight on the forehead giving the appearance of bangs, while from behind it looks as thought it was piled up in a round net. It descends to the shoulders and back where it terminates in a rounded line. All this produces the impression of luxuriant hair. The small breasts are as usual slightly pendulant in form and are portrayed in faint relief, set off by rather shallow carved lines. The thin arms are clearly indicated and are reposing on the abdomen. The lines engraved on the flat ab- domen are intended to portray something in the na- ture of an apron; they pass from the waist down to the legs. The buttocks are elevated, but the pelvic region is narrow. The long legs taper downwards and are then rounded off on the bottom. An opening in the form of an elongated oval divides the lower part of the legs (Gerasimov 1931:22, PI. 15). Figurine No. 9 (Pis. XLIV:6 and XLV:5, Coll. GE, OIPK, 3 70/748). Found in 1929 in the northwestern corner of the dwelling in Excavation VIII. Made of mammoth ivory. Height, 9.5 cm.; width, 2.9 cm. Represents the nude figure of a woman. The facial side of this figurine has been executed in a some- what slipshod manner when compared with the care- ful workmanship on the reverse side. The head is large and the face was either left unfinished or was not successfully turned out in the process of shap- ing. It is flat and slightly turned to the right. The chin is massive, the mouth is faintly outlined, and the eyes are crudely united with the nose - all are visible. The headdress does not protrude over the face and is completely covered with vertical rows of crescent- shaped cuts, their sharp ends pointing downwards. The narrow shoulders are sloping, the flat pendant breasts designated by sharp carved lines, and the abdomen is separated from the legs by some deeply carved lines - all these character- istics are typical of the Mal'ta figurines. The thighs and arms are clearly designated, and although the Arctic Anthropology IV-2 latter have normal proportions, the right one is out- lined only in the area of the shoulder, the remaining part not having been put in. The left arm is slightly bent at the elbow, lies on the abdomen, and two trans- verse lines can be seen on its wrist. A straight line is the only division between the legs which are pressed together. The wide pelvic region and but- tocks are very well formed. An ornamental band en- circles the figurine but does not extend all the way around to the front of the figurine. This ornament consists of one row of irregular triangles, their apices turned toward the center part of the back. It can be seen on the upper part of the legs, just under the but- tocks (Gerasimov 1931:22, PI. 16; 1935:88, Fig. 6). Figurine No. 10 (Pis. XLVI: 7 and XLVII:8, Coll. GE, 370/756). Found in 1929. The material is reindeer antler. Height, 12.1 cm.; width, 1.8 cm. This figurine has the appearance of an elongated shaft round in section, and with the usual trinominal division. There is a flat, but well formed, oval-shaped face on the sphere-like head whose diameter slightly exceeds that of the torso. The forehead, cheeks, and chin stand out. The eyes and nose are marked in by little lines. Rows of fine carved lines which commence near the forehead and descend over the surface of the head down to the neck form a headdress which stands out from, and frames the face. The torso is long and flat, the shoulders narrow and sloping, and the thin arms are pressed tightly to the sides of the body. Two lines which come together at an angle are used to portray a slightly bulging abdomen. The but- tocks and hips are barely indicated, but the long legs, which are squeezed tightly together, are shown in relief. They are divided both in front and in back by a deeply carved line, and they are rounded off on the ends. There is unquestionable evidence of a perfora- tion on the left leg, but the right leg has been broken off (Gerasimov 1931:22-23, PI. 17). Figurine No. 11 (Pis. XLVI: 5 and XLVII:5, Coll. GE, OIPK, 370/758). Found in 1930 in Square XI-3. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 6.1 cm. This figurine is small and, with the exception of the lower part of the legs on which there can be seen evidence of a fresh break, it has been preserved in full. The torso is somewhat flat, narrow, and without details. The thin arms, closely pressed to the body, can be seen on both sides. A clear obliquely directed line divides the legs, and the rounded head is sharply separated from the body. The headdress which frames the face has been reproduced by means of wavy lines. The face is shaped. The eyes and graceful lines of the chin are especially well portrayed. Figurine No. 12 (Pis. XLVIII: 1 and XLIX: 1 , Coll. GE, OIPK, 370/757). Found in 1930 in Square XII-8. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 3.7 cm. To all appearances, this miniature figurine was not com- pleted. Its large head, with the exception of the face, is covered over with crescent-shaped cuts and</page><page sequence="55">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. is clearly separated from a somewhat shapeless body. The face is flat and without details, and the arms are barely outlined along the sides of the body. The short legs, which look as though they had been lopped off, are divided in the same manner as were those of the previous figurine - by a line going in an oblique direction. Figurine No. 13 (Pis. XLIV:3 and XLVII:2, Coll. GE, 3 70/753). Found in 1930. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 4.1 cm.; width, 0.7 cm. This minia- ture has the usual shape of the Mal'ta figurines, but, with the exception of the face, it is covered over entirely with carved transverse parallel lines. The head is elongated upward and terminates in a cone-like projection on the head; the latter is sep- arated from the body by a small bend. The eyes and nose are outlined on the flat face, and the torso, which is a little wider than the head, gradually tapers off downwards where it ends in a flattened curve. Two distinct lines portray the separation between the arms and body in the front of the fig- urine. A triangle carved in both the front and back separates the upper part of the legs from the abdo- men while a deep line serves as the division be- tween the legs. In the back and in the center of this dividing line there is a distinct portrayal of a tail (Gerasimov 1935:113, Fig. 31). The decoration on the figurine plus the portrayal of this tail has prompted V. I. Gromov (1935) to make the specula- tion that we have here an attempt to reproduce the striped skin of a cave lion thrown over a person. Figurine No. 14 (Pis. XLVII:3 and XLVIII:2, Coll. GE, 370/761). Found in 1930 in Square XII: 1). The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 4.4 cm. Repre- sents an unfinished portrayal of a woman, though it is more likely that it was a blank with the head, body, and legs roughed out. The head is massive, and parallel, obliquely arranged lines can be ob- served in the region of the occiput which portray hair. The short upper part of the torso is clearly separated from the elevated pelvic region. The legs are divided only in the front. Figurine No. 15 (Pis. XLVII:6 and XLVIII:3, Coll. GE, 370/762). Found in 1930 in Square XI-3. The ma- terial is mammoth ivory. Height, 2.8 cm. Represents a piece of a small figurine from which the head, shoulders, and lower part of the legs are missing. A transverse line separating the abdomen from the thorax, and a long longitudinal line dividing the legs can be seen. The buttocks project consider- ably from behind, but the general outlines of this figurine are elongated and slender. Figurine No. 16 (Pis. XLVII: 7 and XLVIII:4, Coll. GE, 370/759). Found in 1930. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 4.7 cm. Represents part of a minia- ture figurine which was split lengthwise by an oblique blow thus destroying the head and left half of the figurine. The lower part of the legs was 55 broken off by a second blow. Distinct lines separate the right arm and the legs from the body. What is left of the latter is covered over entirely by carved transverse parallel bands. It is identical to Figurine No. 13. Figurine Head No. 17 (Pis. XLVI:2 and XLIX:2, Coll. GE, 370/764). Found in 1930. The material is mam- moth ivory. Height, 3.7 cm.; width, 2.8 cm. This represents only the head of a figurine, oval in form and exceptionally well executed. There is an apprec- iable break in the neck area. The chin stands out clearly and the rest of the face, which has been par- tially damaged, is both framed and separated from the head by the deeply cut line of the headdress. The latter is made up of parallel rows of zigzag- shaped lines. Figurine Head No. 18 (Pis. XLVI:3 and XLIX:3, Coll. GE, 370/767). Found in 1930 in Square XI-2. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 2.9 cm.; width, 1.5 cm. Has an elongated oval shape and is dam- aged on one end. The surface has been somewhat effaced, but traces of crescent-shaped cuts can be seen nevertheless. Figurine No. 19 (Pis. XLVI:4 and XLVII:4, Coll. IE, 5406/403). Found in 1932. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 4.5 cm.; width, 1.4 cm. This figurine is of the usual type, fairly proportional in outline. The head is clearly separated from the round shoulders, and the arms stretch out along the body, coming to rest on the abdomen. The breasts are shown in light relief. The legs were broken off at the knees, and the line which divides the legs is sharply drawn in the back, but is weakly noted in the front, in the form of an oblique line. Except for the face, the en- tire head is covered by crescent-shaped cuts. A nose is outlined on the flat face. Blank for Figurine No. 20 (PI. XLVIII:5, Coll. GE, 370/760). Made of mammoth ivory. Height, 9 cm. This is a large piece of ivory with roughly indicated head, trunk, arms, and legs. There is a rather small, irregularly-shaped cylindrical hollow in the back, and a longitudinal crack runs down the center of the figurine. Blank for Figurine No. 21 (Coll. GE, 370/763). Found in 1929 in Square V-8. The material is mam- moth ivory. Height, 6.9 cm. This fragment of ivory has different sized ends which were rounded out in an oval shape. Traces of the carving can be ob- served on one of the lateral sides. This fragment was put together from two pieces. Blank for Figurine No. 22. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 6.7 cm.; width, 2.3 cm. Represents a roughly outlined, rather large figurine. The head is massive and cone-shaped. The body has a flattened look, but is wide and there is a clear-cut division between the upper and lower parts. The legs are not parted, and taper downwards. Figurine No. 23 (PI. XLVI:8). Found in 1956 in a large</page><page sequence="56">56 oblong-shaped dwelling. It is made of mammoth ivory and has quite large dimensions: height, 9.7 cm.; width, 4 cm. This figurine represents a plump woman of the usual Mal'ta type. The huge head is very well shaped and the headdress is clearly sep- arated from the face. The breasts are outlined in light relief. The arms are proportional in thickness, bent at the elbows, and come together under the breasts. The undivided legs form a cone at the apex of which is a round opening of small diameter. They are separated from the abdomen by a deeply carved line. The thighs and buttocks are wide and elevated upwards. This figurine possesses a number of de- tails which were not noted on the other figurines. On the upper part of the right breast, coming down at a slant from the shoulder, is a design cut which Gerasimov sees as a portrayal of a braid flung over the shoulder. It is our opinion, however, that it is more likely a patterned shoulder belt which for some reason was left unfinished. On the upper part of the arms there are some deep transverse cuts which may possibly represent bracelets. The upper part of the abdomen that lies just under the reposing arms is encircled by a decorative band made up of deep punctates (Gerasimov 1958:39, PI. 13:a). Figurine No. 24 (PI. XLVI:6). Found also in 1956 inside a dwelling. The material is mammoth ivory. Height, 8 cm.; width, 3 cm. This figurine represents a nude woman and differs from all of the figurines found earlier in all of its contours and by details. The body, especially the lower part, is dispropor- tionately small in comparison with the large, care- fully fashioned head, the latter being completely covered by even rows of patterned lines. The fea- tures of the rather narrow face have been fashioned with exceptional clarity: The low forehead (on the same line with which the long but flat nose descends to the nostrils) is carved in relief, the eyes shown as small round cavities, the mouth indicated by a rather short line, and the long pointed chin has no projection. The head sits on a thick short neck which is distinguished from the body, the arms are resting on the abdomen, and the rounded breasts are shown in relief. The hips and thighs do not jut out, but together with the legs they form a short inverted cone which is rounded off on the end (Gerasimov 1958:40, PI. 13:b). Figurine No. 25 (PI. XLVIII:7). Found in 1956 inside a dwelling. Made of mammoth ivory. Its dimensions, taken from a photograph, are: 3.1 X 0.8 cm. This miniature figurine has features that are similar to those found at an earlier date: The head is large, rounded in form, lacking a neck, and almost equal to the torso in diameter. The small arms are repos- ing on the abdomen. Neither the latter nor the thighs are prominent. The legs are joined together, and are divided from each other and from the abdo- men by a carved line (Gerasimov 1958:40, PI. 13:8). Arctic Anthropology IV -2 Fragment of Figurine No. 26. Found in 1956 inside a dwelling. There is no description of it, nor has a reproduction been made (Gerasimov 1958:40). Figurine No. 27 (PI. XLVIII:8). Found in 1957 in the fourth dwelling. The material is mammoth ivory. Dimensions, 5.8 X 0.8 cm. This long, slender figurine is entirely covered over by a design composed of transverse lines, and it resembles completely Fig- urine No. 13 from Mal'ta. It was found lying in the vertebral canal of a reindeer (Gerasimov 1958:47, Fig. 18:a). Figurine No. 28 (PI. XLVIII:6). Found in 1957 almost in the middle of the passage way to the fourth dwell- ing. The material is mammoth ivory. Its dimensions are 9 X 3.7 cm. It is quite evident that it was not finished, but on it are indicated clearly and in relief the voluminous abdomen and the small breasts which are triangular in shape (Gerasimov 1958:47, Fig. 18:b). Figurine No. 29 (PI. XLVIII:9). Found in 1957 in a sterile level lying over the fifth dwelling. The ma- terial is mammoth ivory. Dimensions, 6 X 1.3 cm. The head has been broken off. The long legs are joined together, and the line which separates them from the abdomen can be made out. Arms are indi- cated (Gerasimov 1958:51, Fig. 22:v [Russian letter]). REPRESENTATIONS OF ANIMALS. Engraved por- trayals of a mammoth and snakes were found at Mal'ta in addition to sculptured bird figurines. Portrayal of a Mammoth (Pis. L: 1 and LI:1, Coll. GE, 370/731). Found in 1929 in Square 1-2. Length, 8.2 cm.; width, 3.6 cm. This engraved portrayal of a mammoth found at Mal'ta is unique among the Palaeolithic art of the U.S.S.R. It was engraved on the outer convex smoothed side of a plate of mam- moth ivory. This plate has an elongated shape: On one edge there is a slightly damaged opening, near the opposite edge are two rows of punctates. The portrayal of the mammoth itself was executed by fine, sharp, bold strokes and is shown in profile. Shown in characteristic fashion are the realistically executed line of the round head with a depression along the neck and the significant rise of the slightly humped back. The trunk, two short tusks, and thick, stolidly planted legs can be seen easily. The por- trayal of closely placed straight parallel lines under the smooth outline of the belly in all likelihood repre- sents the long wooly underhairs. This entire draw- ing strikes one by its simplicity and completeness - a convincing portrayal of this mighty animal was created simply by means of a few strokes. M. M. Gerasimov has made the observation that this piece with the portrayal of a mammoth appears to be only a fragment of some sort of artifact which possibly had a utilitarian function (Gerasimov 1931: 25, PI. 17; 1935:115, Fig. 33). Representation of Snakes (Pis. L:2 and LI: 2). The material is mammoth ivory. Length, 14.1 cm.; width,</page><page sequence="57">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 8.5 cm. This is an engraved portrayal of snakes on a large, slightly curved ivory plate which has a trapeziform shape, rounded corners, and a hole in the center. On one side of the plate are some spirals made up of rows of punctates. On the other, concave side three snakes have been portrayed, engraved by sharp, deep lines. Their heads all face the edge in one direction. The uppermost snake has a small head and an undulating body. The bodies of the other two are portrayed in an even more wriggly manner, and their heads, especially that of the middle one, have been excessively exaggerated. Gerasimov believes that they show a similarity with southern species of snakes, in particular the cobra (Gerasimov 1931:16-17, PI. 11). Portrayals of Birds. A whole series of carved por- trayals of birds have been found at Mal'ta, not only homogeneous portrayals of birds in flight, but totally unique figurines as well. Nine portrayals of birds analogous to one another were found during the ex- cavations of 1928-1934. Of these, eight are intact; the head of the other one had been broken. Eight of these birds were found in various places at the site, but one was found in a child's burial, lying on its chest. Bird Figurine No. 1 (Pis. XLIX:8 and LII: 1 , Coll. GE, 3 70/739). Made of mammoth ivory. Length, 11.9 cm. This figurine is large and has exceedingly elon- gated proportions. The little head, which is egg- like in shape, is located at the end of a very long neck which is round in section and widens slightly as it nears the body. The neck is longer than the body. The body has a flattened look, and an open- ing obtained by one-sided drilling was placed on the rounded end of the figurine. Because the outer edge of this opening has been broken off the body looks as though it ends with a pair of short bow legs. On the foreward part of both sides of the body by the neck there are two short, wide projec- tions which portray spread out wings. In spite of the conventionalization and simplicity of this por- trayal, it undoubtedly represents some kind of a waterfowl in flight (Gerasimov 1931:24, PI. 18:a). It was found in 1929 in Excavation I. Bird Figurine No. 2 (Pis. XLIX:6 and LII:8, Coll. GE, 370/742). Found in 1929 in Square VI-1. The ma- terial is mammoth ivory. Length, 7.7 cm. Analogous to the previous figurine except for a slight differ- ence in proportions. The head by comparison is larger, and the body is elongated in appearance. The small trapeziform wings look as though they were set against the body, but the body and neck look like they form a whole. The legs stretched out behind the bird, form a loop which has been some- what damaged on the lower part (Gerasimov 19 31: 24, PI. 18:b). Bird Figurine No. 3 (PI. LII: 2, Coll. GE", 370/744). Found in 1929 in Square 1-13. The material is mam- 57 moth ivory. Length, 4.8 cm. The style is similar to that of the previous figurines, but this one has a very long neck which terminates in a small oval- shaped head. The body is flat and has been rounded off on both sides and on the back where a round open- ing is located. There are two rather small projections of semi-oval form situated on the body close to the neck. This figurine was found in an incomplete form and was thus described by Gerasimov, but the miss- ing part was subsequently discovered - the head and part of the neck (Gerasimov 1931:24). Bird Figurine No. 4 (Pis. XLIX:9 and LII: 7, Coll. GE, 340/741). Found in 1929 in Square VII-4. The ma- terial is mammoth ivory. Length, 10 cm. Analogous to the preceding, different from them only in dimen- sions and by a slight difference in proportions. The neck is shorter than the body and terminates in a large head which by its shape resembles a rhomb. The body is wide and round. The wings are large by comparison and look as though they are spread out. There is a drilled opening in the lower part (Gerasi- mov 1931:24, PI. 18:c). Bird Figurine No. 5 (Pis. XLIX:7 and LII:4, Coll. GE, 370/740). Found in 1929 in Square VII-15. The ma- terial is mammoth ivory. Length, 10.2 cm. The neck is longer than the body and terminates in a diamond- shaped head which by comparison is large. The body is short, fairly wide, and flat; the sides have been rounded off. The wings are easily distinguishable between the body and neck, and have the appearance of rather small oval projections. A round hole is lo- cated on the lower end (Gerasimov 1931:24, PI. 18:i). Bird Figurine No. 6 (PI. LII: 5, Coll. GE, 370/743). Found in 1929 in Square VII-2. The material is mam- moth ivory. Length, 6.2 cm. It is similar to the pre- ceding but its dimensions are smaller and it was not altogether finished. A small triangular-shaped head ends in a comparatively short neck. The body is quite long and narrow and has been rounded off on the sides and in back. The drilling in the lower part seems to have only been begun since traces of it are evidenced by a hollowed out spot (Gerasimov 1931: 24, PI. 18:e). Bird Figurine No. 7 (PI. LII: 12, Coll. GE, 1407/255). Found in 1929 in Square VIII-6( ?) [ - author]. The material is mammoth ivory. Length, 5.3 cm. This small figurine is analogous to the preceding, and it portrays a flying bird. The head is very small and oval in form, ending in a round neck which widens as it nears the body. The latter has an oblong shape, oval in section, and is provided with two rather small projections which represent the wings. A round open- ing is located in the lower part of the body. This figurine had been broken into two pieces. Bird Figurine No. 8 (PI. LII: 13, Coll. GE, 370/745). Found in 1934 in Square XI-3. The material is mam- moth ivory. Length, 4.7 cm. This is a fragment of a figurine. The head and the greater portion of the</page><page sequence="58">58 neck are missing. By comparison with the other figurines the body of this one is very long. The wings project slightly and have a semi-oval shape. The round opening on the lower part of the body is placed asymmetrically. Bird Figurine No. 9 (PI. LII: 10, Coll. GE, 408/10). foi nd in 1929 in a burial. * It was lying under the thoracic vertebrae between fragments of the false ribs. The material is mammoth ivory. Length, 6.2 cm. It was put together from several fragments. In style and technique it is analogous to the other bird figurines found at this site. The neck is very long, round in section, and terminates in a small head. The body has been flattened, rounded on the end, and is oval in section. Along both sides of the up- per part of the body there are two carved, rather small oval-shaped projections, the wings. There is a small round opening on the lower part of the body which is located at the apex of an angle formed by two acute angled cuts. This last mentioned detail singles out this figurine from the entire series. ** The head of the bird was pointing downward on the child's skeleton, thus indicating that it had been worn as a pendant (Gerasimov 1931:28, PL 21:c; 1935:122). Figurine No. 10 (Pis. XLIX:10 and LIII:3, Coll. GE, 370/768). Found in 1929 in Square IV-13. The ma- terial is mammoth ivory. Length, 4.3 cm. This figurine is totally unlike any of the previous por- trayals of birds. It apparently represents a swim- ming bird and is best seen in profile. The large head has an elongated, pointed shape and is directed downwards. The body is wide and massive and ter- minates in a fairly small triangular shaped tail. On the fore part of the body there are a pair of small wings directed downwards, and in the area of the tail there is a triangular shaped projection directed upwards with a round opening on it for suspension (Gerasimov 1931:25, Fig. 18). New and extremely interesting portrayals of birds have been discovered at Mal'ta during the course of the last few years. Evidently the famous child burial at Mal'ta. - Ed. 'The meaning of the Russian words seem quite clear in this passage, but they do not match the il- lustration (PI. LII, No. 10). The majority of the figurines on this plate have notches on the upper "corner" of the opening, but they form more of an obtuse rather than an acute angle. Perhaps the author had another figurine in mind, or the type setters made a mistake. It is difficult to figure out just why this particular specimen was "singled out of the entire series" on that basis alone. - Trans. Arctic Anthropology IV-2 Bird Figurine No. 11 (PI. LII: 6). It was found in 1956 inside a dwelling. It is made of mammoth ivory. It is analogous to the other figurines discovered at earlier dates at this site. This one is a representa- tion of a waterfowl in flight, and it possesses the same characteristic features found on the previous portrayals of birds - a fairly small body that looks as though it is lying flat on its belly, the projections on either side of the body that portray wings, the opening near the end of the body, and the long, round neck that terminates in an oval head. The individual features of this figurine appear to be the difference in the shape of its wings - one of them has a regular semi-oval form, the other is shaped like a trapezoid (Gerasimov 1958:39, Fig. 12:a). Bird Figurine No. 12 (PI. LIII:2). Found in 1956 in- side a dwelling. This is a portrayal of a large bird which by all indications appears to be a partridge. There is no analogy to it in Palaeolithic art. The figurine is realistic: there is a rounded, massive body, conical projections of the legs directed back- wards, a fairly small head provided with a strong, thick beak, and the wings, which are shown in relief, pressed to the body and covered by a design con- sisting of longitudinal rows of crescent- shaped cuts. This figurine was made of mammoth ivory and has some slight damage (Gerasimov 1958:39, Fig. 12:b). Bird Figurine No. 13 (PI. LII:9). Found in 1957 in semi-subterranean house No. 3. This figurine is similar to the other portrayals of flying birds, but its dimensions are larger (length, 1.49 cm.; width, 3 cm.). Because of its heavy bulk, small head, and long neck, Gerasimov thinks that it is possibly a portrayal of a swan (Gerasimov 1958:46, Fig. 16:a). Bird Figurine No. 14. Found in 195 7 in dwelling No. 5. The material is mammoth ivory. This is the usual type of Mal'ta figurine portraying a waterfowl in flight. It has somewhat small dimensions. The lower end of this figurine has been broken; the side of the opening has also been damaged. It is the opinion of Gerasimov that this figurine is the por- trayal of a loon (Gerasimov 1958:51, Fig. 22:a). Bird Figurine No. 15 (PI. LIII:1). Found in 1957 in dwelling No. 5. The treatment of this figurine is quite unusual, for by all indications it is a portrayal of a swan shown in a relaxed standing position. The body is round and massive, and the neck is charac- teristically curved. Instead of a head, there is simply a rounding off at the end of the neck. There is a rather blunt projection, semi-oval in shape, on the lower part of the body in which an opening has been drilled (Gerasimov 1958:51, Fig. 22:b). CARVED OBJECTS. The purpose of many of the carved objects from Mal'ta cannot be interpreted with complete assurance. Among these objects we will first describe a shaft of mammoth ivory which is long, slightly curved and elliptical in section</page><page sequence="59">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. (Pis. XLIX:5 and LIII: 7). It gradually flattens toward one end, but the opposite end has a cylindrical thickening which is separated from the main shaft by a shallow neck. The over-all length of this shaft is 21 cm.; the width is 1.7 cm.; and the thickness is 1.1 cm. The outer side of the shaft is completely covered by longitudinal parallel rows of crescent- shaped cuts, while the opposite side is only par- tially decorated (Gerasimov 1931:17, PI. 10:i). The second object has not been preserved in full, but it is no less interesting and enigmatic. It is a large shaft of mammoth ivory oval in section (PI. LIII: 8). Length, 10.8 cm.; width, 1.5 cm.; and thickness (average), 0.8 cm. One end of this ob- ject has been flattened and has a round opening which was bifacially drilled. The opposite end thickens slightly, curves smoothly, and then appears to have been broken off in the area of the curve. The thickened part here is decorated by three paral- lel rows of punctates (three to a row), and there is evidence of a fourth row at the place of the break. On the lateral sides of the thickened area there is also evidence of a cut which extends through to the opposite side. The entire outer surface is covered by transverse parallel lines which partially extend around to each side. The inner side is smooth (Gerasimov 1931:17, Fig. 10: j). A few other peculiar objects of uncertain func- tion should also be mentioned at this time. Fragment of an Artifact (Pis. LI: 3 and LIII:4). The material is mammoth ivory. Length, 8.5 cm.; width, 3.5 cm. This fragment is covered by an intricate design made up of wide carved lines and punctates. It closely resembles a stylized portrayal of a fish. What looks like a head with an open mouth can be observed as well as the three concentric lines which separate it from the body. The body is wide and is decorated with closed circles which are irregular in form and made of pits. Parallel grooves go along both sides of the tail. The reverse side of this ob- ject, however, as Gerasimov correctly observes, indicates that it is only the fragment of some kind of an object, and when viewed in its entirety it really has no resemblance whatsoever to a fish (Gerasimov 1931:17-18, PI. 10:k). Object of Mammoth Ivory (Pis. XLIX:4 and LIII: 5, Coll. GE, 370/766). Height, 2.2 cm.; width, 2 cm. This object has a peculiar shape resembling a mitre. The lower end has been carefully smoothed in the form of a hollowed -out pit. The entire outer surface is covered with concentric rows of crescent- shaped cuts which have been somewhat effaced on the top. Narrow Shaft of Mammoth Ivory (PI. LV:3). Length, 11.7 cm. This object is round in section and is topped with a peculiar cap. The shaft is partially decorated with a twisted spiral, especially on the area adjacent to the cap. Such an object, proposes 59 Gerasimov, may have served as a hairpin (Gerasimov 1931:14, PI. 9:e). There are also a number of fragments of objects similar to the above mentioned object (PI. LV: 1 , 2, 4-8; see Gerasimov 1935, Fig. 27:10 and 11). ORNAMENTS . Ornaments make up a numerous cate- gory of specimens from Mal'ta. We will sort out several groups of these here. Diadems (head or brow bands). The first ornament of this kind was discovered in the child burial where it had been placed on the skull, thus proving beyond a doubt that it was used for this purpose. It is a fragment of a band bent from a thin, narrow shaft of mammoth ivory. A small hole, apparently for lacing, is located on each end of the band. The entire surface is polished, but, because it had been lying under the weight of the slab that covered the burial, it was greatly deformed and partially destroyed (Gerasimov 1931, PI. 20). A number of fragments of head bands were found in the cultural level at this site which Gerasimov origi- nally described as pieces of flat, curved needles with large eyelets (PI. LIV:3-11; see Gerasimov 1931:13, PI. 9:b). Later on, after observing that whole objects of this type had not been found, he proposed that in reality, these "needles" might possibly be fragments of artifacts which had an entirely different purpose, such as thin head bands or bracelets (Gerasimov 1941: 78). It is perfectly true that on close examamination these artifacts have nothing in common with needles with the exception of the big eye and, furthermore, the outer side of these flattened curved plates is almost always covered with a design of parallel rows of round punctates. In 1934 a small piece from such an object was found with carefully executed design consisting of a row of undulating lines parallel to one another. Without a doubt, a thin curved plate of mammoth ivory also belongs to this category of things: its ends have been rounded and each one is provided with a large opening (PI. LIV:l,Coll. IE, 5406/404). Close to one of the ends there is a design on the outer side made up of three rows of punctates, four to each row. The length of this plate is about 12 cm.; the width, 1.6 cm. Bracelets. Most of these were found in a fragmented state. On the upper part of an arm, near the shoulder of a skeleton, fragments of a bracelet were found in the form of a thin, curved plate of mammoth ivory, each end of which had a round opening (Gerasimov 1931:28). Several other artifacts which served as brace- lets were found in the cultural level at Mal'ta, either whole or in fragments (PI. XLVIII: 13-15), and made from either mammoth ivory or boghead. * Attention *A variety of cannel coal, dark brown in color, almost lusterless, and having a very fine texture. It is also known as Torbanite. - Trans.</page><page sequence="60">60 should also be called to a small bracelet which has the appearance of a flat narrow arch with an open- ing on each end. It is made of mammoth ivory. Length, 4 cm. (PI. LIV:2; see Coll. GE, 370/735). An interesting, somewhat unfinished, large bracelet which has no known analogy has been found at Mal'ta within the past few years. It is made of boghead. The diameter, taken on the outer walls, is 8.6 cm., and on the inner walls, 6 cm. Thus the thickness of the bracelet is 1.3 cm. (PI. XLVIII:12; see Gerasimov 1958, Fig. 1 lib). Plates or Clasps. A large number of these were found at Mal'ta. The first one that should be men- tioned is a good sized flat plate, sub-quadrangular in form, with a portrayal on both surfaces (Pis. L:2 and LI: 2). The material is mammoth ivory. Length, 13.6 cm.; width, 8.2 cm. The corners have been strongly rounded and there is a circular opening in the center. The design on the outer side is formed of spiral rows of round pits. The largest design of this type surrounds the opening, and two other spirals, which form the letter "S," face each other from the opposite ends of the lower half of the plate. Facing each other from the opposite ends of the up- per half are spiral designs, one end of which is curled up while the other end is free. There is a portrayal of snakes on the reverse concave side of this same plate, but they have al- ready been described. Gerasimov has made the cor- rect observation that this plate was not simply an ornament. He regards the spirals as a representa- tion of the snake's movements, and, furthermore, he looks on the punctates as an accurate reproduction of its scales (Gerasimov 1931:16, PI. 11). There is nothing to contradict the idea that this plate served as something besides an ornament, that is, that it had a magical purpose. However, the spiral-shaped pattern may have had another significance, since the snake's movements were already sufficiently well portrayed by their form. The second plate, or clasp, was found in the child burial to the right of the lumbar vertebrae. Its dimensions are smaller by comparison with those of the first one (diameter, 5 cm.). It is round in shape and has an asymmetrically placed circular opening in the center. There is a decorative design on the outer side made up of rows of deeply carved undu- lating lines which resemble snakes crawling in one direction. The inner side of the plate was simply smoothed down, and left unworked. The fact that the design had been placed only on one side and the worn nature of the opening indicate that this artifact possibly served as a button for clothing, fastened to it by means of a knotted thong. On the other hand, however, the conventionalized portrayal of snakes links it to the realm of magical concepts (Gerasimov 1931:28, PI. 21 :v [Russian letter], 1935:121). Asim- ilar medallion or button with an undulating design, Arctic Anthropology IV-2 as Gerasimov calls it, was also found in the cultural level at the site (Pis. L:7 and LI: 4). There were a number of other similar artifacts found here having varied dimensions and both with and without designs, but in a poorer state of preservation (PI. L:4, 8, 9). We will first consider objects of a plaque type which were found in a burial and may possibly have served as buttons: 1) a fragmented, thin plate of mammoth ivory of an irregular round shape with an opening in the center, and an intricate design all over its facial side made up of parallel zigzag lines; its dimensions, 3.1 X 3 cm. (PI. L:6, Coll. IE, 5406/420); 2) a thin plate of mammoth ivory of an irregular quad- rangular form with two corners broken off and an opening in the center; the outer surface is covered by six parallel rows of crescent-shaped cuts; its di- mensions, 2.6 X 2.3 cm. (PI. L:5, Coll. IE, 5412/1028). Several fragments of similar plates of mammoth ivory are covered with various decorative designs which resemble those found on the heads of the fig- urines. For example, a fairly small fragment from a plate of mammoth ivory (dimensions, 3.3 X 1.6 cm.) decorated by zigzag-shaped lines resembling those which portrayed hair on figurines (PI. LV:40, Coll. GE, 370/719); a second similar fragment of a plate (dimensions, 3.5 X 1.4 cm.), covered by pairs of punctates resembling those on the head of figurine No. 4 (PI. LV:38, Coll. GE, 370/720); and, finally, a fragment of an oblong oval plate (dimensions, 3.5 X 0.9 cm.), and having a punctate design (PI. LV:39, Coll. GE, 370/721). Another type of ivory plate, large and thin, came from Mal'ta. One example of this type was discovered in 1956 by Gerasimov who placed it in the category of men's pectoral ornaments (PI. LIV:12). This huge plate of mammoth ivory consists of two halves (over-all length, 25 cm.; width, 5 cm.), and it has an oblong shape. There is a small circular opening on each of its tapered and slightly rounded ends, and three smaller round holes placed vertically on each half, near the point of junction between the latter two. There is a punctate design on the outer surface of the plate which forms some kind of a sub-triangular figure along one of the sides; there is also a band made up of two rows of punctates which stretches obliquely across the end (Gerasimov 1958, Fig. ll:g [Russian letter]). There is still another wide, thin plate of mammoth ivory which is irregular in form (PI. LIV:14, Coll. IE, 5406/410). One edge tapers somewhat, and has a round opening. Various streaks and scratches can be observed on the outer surface. Its dimensions are: 12.3 X 3.7 cm. In addition to these whole plates of mammoth ivory, there are fragments of the same. The first of these appears to be part of a wide, thin plaque, both sides of which have been polished (PI. LIV:15, Coll. GE, 370/711). The oval opening on one rounded</page><page sequence="61">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. corner is all that has been preserved. There are traces of a second opening below the first one on the broken edge. The dimensions are: 3.4 X 2.5 cm. A second fragment, belonging to a similar plaque, has dimensions of 3.5 X 3.9 cm. The rec- tangular edge and the round opening are still intact (PI. LIV:16, Coll. GE, 370/712). The third fragment of a wide, thin plaque repre- sents the carefully worked, rounded end of the same. It has a regular round opening. Dimensions, 4.8 X 2.8 cm. (PI. LIV:13, Coll. IE, 5412/840). The fourth fragment of a thin, smoothed out plaque appears to be a piece which was cut off from a larger artifact. Dimensions, 6 X 2.4 cm. (PI. LIV: 18, Coll. IE, 5412/754). Pendants and Beads. A great number of various pen- dants made of very different materials were found at Mal'ta. The first of these that should be mentioned is a splendid necklace which was discovered in the child burial, still lying in its original position on the chest of the skeleton. It consists of one large center pendant, six lateral pendants, and one hun- dred and twenty circular flat beads (PI. LVI:5). In Gerasimov's estimation, the central pendant portrays a soaring bird. It has a rounded, massive body, oval in form, and elongated conical projections which extend from both sides. There is a round opening on the upper end of the body for suspension. The en- tire surface of this pendant is covered with parallel rows of rather shallow punctates. The other six pendants have similar shapes, like figure "8's." They are rather small, thin plates, the lower halves of which are decorated on the facial side by shal- low, but quite large punctates forming one spiraled flourish with a small, round drilled opening in the center. The upper half of these pendants is not decorated, but the opening for suspension is lo- cated in the center of them. The size of these pen- dants ranges from 1.3 X 1.8 to 1.7 X 2.5 cm. The beads are small (diameter up to 0.8 cm.), but quite thick (up to 0.3 cm.), and they are circular and flat in shape. They were strung on the same thread as the others. Both the beads and the pendants are made of mammoth ivory (Gerasimov 1931:28, PI. 21: a, 1935:121, Fig. 37). Small pendants also made of mammoth ivory were found in the cultural level at this site. One of them resembles the pendants from the burial. It has a figure eight form and a round drilled opening in both halves. The facial side of this thin little plate has a design made up of two rows of shallow punctates (Pis. LV:9 and LVI:2; see Gerasimov 1931: 15, PI. 10:c). There is still another fragment of a similar ob- ject in the form of a thin plate with an opening in the center and four pits surrounding it (PI. LV: 10, Coll. IE, 5406/424). Besides this, there are three small round pen- 61 dants, varied in shape, which Gerasimov has cate- gorized as beads. One of them is quite large and looks as though it had been formed of two irregular (in diameter) parts flattened on one side (Pis. LV:11 and LVI:6). The smaller of the two parts is decorated by four symmetrically placed punctates, and the largest part, by rows of wavy lines which cover its entire surface with the exception of the flat side. There is an opening cut through for suspension on the lower end of the largest part. The height of the pendant is 3.2 cm. (Gerasimov 1931:16, PI. 10:h). The second pendant is conical in shape, trian- gular in section, and has an opening near the base. Its height is 1.8 cm. (PI. LV:13, ibid.). The third pendant of mammoth ivory is small, round in form, with two obliquely carved edges which meet at an angle; the opening goes through both of these carved portions (PI. LV:14, ibid.). A similar small pendant was discovered during the excavations of 1934 (PI. LV:15, Coll. IE, 5412/656). Pendants of another type were also found at Mal'ta. There were notches on these instead of open- ings for suspension. These pendants were fashioned from narrow and oblong water worn pebbles of ser- pentine or fibrous gypsum. Close to one end is a deeply grooved furrow which encircles the pendant (Pis. LV:23 and LVI: 1; see Gerasimov 1931:15, PI. 10: b). Crystals of calcite on which there are round grooves for hanging can also be placed in this same category (Pis. LI:7-12 and LV:31-34; see Gerasimov 1931:15, PI. 10:a). Various beads were also found at Mal'ta: 1. Round flat beads with openings in the center. Diameter, 1.4 cm.; thickness, 0.6 cm. (PI. LV: 16-17; see Gerasimov 1931:16, PI. 10:f). These beads are made of massive circles of deer antler. 2. Beads made of mammoth ivory of the same shape, but with smaller dimensions; they are flat, thoroughly rounded, more or less of a true circular form with a unifacially drilled opening which is off center. The largest diameter attained is 0.9 cm.; thickness, 0.3 cm. (Pis. LV:18-21 and LVI: 8-11; see Gerasimov 1931: 16, PI. 10). 3. Cylindrical beads made of reindeer antler. Length, 1.4 cm.; diameter, 0.6 cm. (PI. LV:27-30; see Gerasi- mov 1931:16, PI. 10). 4. Tubular beads made of the long bones of birds (PI. LV: 24-26). A great many epipheses from the knees of polar foxes were found along with these. They had round cuts on them, and they appeared to be the remains from the manufacture of beads (Gerasimov 1931, PI. 10:e). 5. Beads of an odd, sub-triangular shape with open- ings on the narrow end. Their dimensions are: 0.8 X 0.6 cm. (PI. LV: 14-15, Coll. IE, 5406/383 and 461). The vertebrae of fish with drilled openings down the center can also be included in this group (PI. LI: 5; see Gerasimov 1931:16, PI. 10:d).</page><page sequence="62">62 45. Buret* The settlement of Buret' , located on the right bank of the Angara River not far from the mouth of the Belaia River, appears to be a direct analogy to Mal'ta, although works of art from this site are much more of a rarity. Five female figurines were discovered here. Female Figurine No. 1 (Pis. LVII: 1 and LVIIIil). The material is mammoth ivory. Length, 12.2 cm.; width (at the shoulders), 1.9 cm. Found in 1936 in dwelling No. 1. The preservation is excellent. This figurine of a woman has been carefully shaped and rounded on all sides although it has elongated, dis- proportional measurements. The head is shaped like an elongated oval and tapers upwards. The face is well formed with a prominent brow and pro- truding cheeks and molars and a rounded chin. The eyes and nose are somewhat less manifest. The headdress is sharply separated from the convex face and frames the latter by a massive edge fillet. The shoulders are narrow and round; the short flat arms stretch out lengthwise along the sides of the body, terminating with short cuts; the body is nar- row, the breasts and abdomen flat; the hips project very slightly, and the lines of the back are smooth; the legs are tightly pressed together and divided only by, a deep longitudinal line both in front and in back. With the exception of the face, the figurine is almost entirely covered by an ornamental design composed of crescent-shaped cuts arranged in ver- tical rows. In some areas the crescent-shaped cuts are replaced by small conical-shaped perforations. In a compositional respect, the decorative de- sign possesses its own peculiar rhythmical sym- metry which is unrelated to the form of the figurine (Okladnikov 1941b: 104-108). Female Figurine No. 2 (Pis. LVII: 3 and LVIII:2). The material is mammoth ivory. Length, 5.1 cm.; width (at the shoulders), 1.8 cm. Found in 1939 in dwelling No. 2. It has not been fully preserved: the entire lower part has been broken off with the exception of the abdomen and left thigh. The figu- rine represents the nude figure of a woman. It has a round head with a flat face on which the nose is barely discernable. The head is clearly separated from the body, while the face is set off by a splen- did headdress in the form of fan-shaped rows of round punctates which are connected to one another. Deeply carved lines designate the rather small, loose-hanging breasts on the flat chest. The thin arms are reposing on the abdomen. Judging by the preserved part of the left leg, it is possible to con- clude that the hips were not wide and that the legs tapered downwards. On the lower part, a deeply carved line can be seen delineating the left leg (Okladnikov 1941:60, Fig. 10:b). Female Figurine No. 3 (Pis. LVII: 2 and LVIII:4). Arctic Anthropology IV-2 The material is mammoth ivory. Length, 5.5 cm.; width (at the shoulders), 1.6 cm. It has been pre- served in full. Represents the nude figure of a human being. The proportions are not symmetrical: the head is very large and the legs are short. The mouth and eyes are crudely outlined on the flat face, the face being framed by a sharp line behind which the headdress rises slightly. It consists of parallel rows of faintly undulating lines which radiate out from the face, cover the head entirely, and terminate at the neck. The head looks as though it grew out of the narrow and extremely sloping shoulders, for there is no neck as such. The torso is flat, the breasts not designated, the abdomen is small but protruding, and the buttocks are narrow and characteristically ele- vated. The arms are closely pressed to the sides of the body ending in curves on the abdomen; the legs are tightly pressed together and also end below in a curve. They are divided both in front and in back by a deeply carved line. A round opening has been drilled on this line at the level of the knees (Okladnikov 1960:282, 284, Fig. 5:1-3). Female Figurine No. 4 (Pis. LVII: 5 and LVIII:5). The material is mammoth ivory. Length, 8.5 cm.; width, 2 cm. It represents a crudely made, apparently un- finished figurine with the usual three part division. The head is distinctly separated from the body by a short neck; it is slightly thrust forward but otherwise without details. The occiput is flat, rounding off slightly on the sides. The body is flat, rounded, and featureless except for the arms, roundly bent at the elbows, which can be seen along its sides. When viewed from the front, the thighs and pelvis form one unit, but when seen in profile or from behind, there is a pronounced elevation of the buttocks, while at the same time they smoothly taper into the lines of the legs. The latter are pressed together tightly, broken to a slight degree on the lower part and sep- arated from behind by a wide groove. When one ob- serves this figurine from the front, it has the appear- ance of being unfinished, but when viewed from the back, it seems quite complete (Okladnikov 1960:284- 285, Fig. 5:8-10). Female Figurine No. 5 (Pis. LVII: 4 and LVIII:3). The material is serpentine. Length, 4.3 cm.; width, 0.6 cm.; thickness, 0.3 cm. It is preserved in full. It has the appearance of a miniature shaft on which only the basic details have been outlined. It is oval in section. The head is somewhat elongated upwards and has been rounded off and is separated from the body by a sharp line. The usual characteristic en- graved line demarcates the breasts from the abdomen on the long, flat body. The arms, tightly pressed to the sides and somewhat turned toward the abdomen, are lightly outlined. There is the usual triangular division between the abdomen and legs; the latter are pressed together, but instead of tapering off below, they remain at the same thickness all the way</page><page sequence="63">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. down. A longitudinal line divides them. The tip of the right leg has been broken off (Okladnikov I960: 285, Fig. 5:4-6). A portrayal of a bird was also discovered at Buret' which is similar to those in the series of carved flying birds from Mal'ta (Pis. LVII:6 and LVIII:6, Irkutsk Art Museum). The material is mam- moth ivory. This figurine has a diamond-shaped head, a fairly thick neck, and an oval body in the forward part of which are located two round projec- tions portraying wings. There is a round opening of small diameter on the rear part. The analogy with the Mal'ta figurines is complete. Another portrayal of a bird was found in 1939 at Buret1. The material is reindeer antler. It has the appearance of a long shaft which terminates in a well expressed head resembling that of a water fowl. It is possible, as Okladnikov has suggested, that it is only part of a large carved portrayal of a bird which had a wooden body (Okladnikov 1940:61). A miniature nephrite disk, having indisputable traces of polishing, was found in a number of what appeared to be specially selected flat pebbles of dark green nephrite and precious (gem quality) ser- pentine (PI. LVII:7). A round opening of small diam- eter is located in the center (Okladnikov 1941:61). A number of other objects made of serpentine may have been used as buttons or clasps. These rather small pieces of serpentine have shapes like rec- tangles, trapeziums or parallelapipeds; their surface have been smoothed and there is a circular notch in the middle (PI. LVII:9-15, Coll. MA MGU, 489/56, 59, 140). There is a curious oblong thin pendant made of serpentine with notches on both ends (PI. LVII:8, Coll. MA MGU, 489/142). In addition to the above mentioned objects, Okladnikov (1941a: 18) mentions the discovery of pendants made of antler from Buret1. 46. Krasnyi IAr The site of Krasnyi IAr is located on the right bank of the Angara River about 200 kilometers below Irkutsk and 12 kilometers above the village of Maly- shevka. An unusual carved pendant, apparently portraying a seated human figure, was discovered in 195 7 in the cultural level at a depth of 2.85 m. from the surface (Pis. LVI:13 and LIX:1). This small figure is made of bone, carefully polished, and has an enigmatic outline. The dimensions are: height, 3.7 cm.; width, 1.1 cm.; and thickness, 0.8 cm. The front side consists of two convex surfaces of un- equal length which come together at an angle. The reverse side consists of two flat surfaces which form an obtuse angle. The ends of this object have been rounded. In profile it distinctly resembles a semi-seated figure devoid of details, and, in truth, 63 very simplified. There are uneven short lines going in a transverse direction on the flat surface of the reverse side. These same lines, though more deeply etched and widely spaced, are clearly indicated on the left lateral side of the figurine (Abramova 1959: 103-107). In 19 59 some peculiar beads were found at this site. They were carved out of the enamel of the teeth of a large animal, evidently the horse, the bones of which prevailed in the faunal remains of this site. The first bead has an irregular rounded shape. The dimensions: 1X1.1 cm. (PI. LIX:3). A round opening bifacially drilled is located almost in the center. The diameter and depth of the drilling is considerably less on the outer enameled surface than it is on the opposite side. Two other beads have smaller dimensions: 0.8 X 0.7 cm. , and 0.7 X 0.6 cm. (PI. LIX:2, 4). They have a sub-quadrangular form with rounded corners and an opening in the center. The drilling was car- ried out in the same manner, that is, chiefly from the inner surface, and only when a thin layer of enamel remained was the drilling on the outer sur- face begun. Two other fragments of similar beads, broken in two, were also found here (PI. LIX:5, 6; see Abramova 1960b:38). 47. Af onto va Gora II s Along the Yenesei River Palaeolithic art is repre- sented by the discoveries at the well known site of Afontova Gora II, which is within the outskirts of the city of Krasnoyarsk. The lower cultural level here had a thickness of between 0.7 and 1 m. , and it was bedded in a loess-like sandy loam at a depth of 12 m. from the surface. In contrast to the other sites along the Yenesei which contained no works of art at all, several dozen specimens of various ornaments were found in the lower level here. A disk made of agalmatolite was found here with an opening in the center and having striations and chips on its flat surfaces (PI. LX:3). The diameter is 4.2 cm., and the point of its greatest thickness is - 1.5 cm. G. P. Sosnovskii calls it a pendant since there is evidence of wear from a cord around the opening (Sosnovskii 1934:256, PI. IV: 1 1 , 1935:345). The purpose of the three round balls of mammoth ivory is vague (PI. LX:8-10; see Sosnovskii 1934: 255, PI. IV:8). Among the ornaments found here were: flat circles of soapstone and bone with openings of various diameters placed asymmetrically from 1- 2 mm. to 1 cm. (PI. LX: 12-24; see Sosnovskii 1934: 255, PI. V:7-9, 11); tubular beads of the long bones of hares, the epiphyses of which had been cut off (PI. LX:6-7; see Sosnovskii 1934:255, PL V:12-14); drilled teeth of the reindeer and polar fox (PI. LX: 1 1 , 24-25; see Sosnovskii 1934:255, PL V:17-18).</page><page sequence="64">64 Various articles made of antler and bone having round openings were also found at this site (PI. LIX: 13-17, from the collection of GE OIPK). 48. Af onto va Gora HI Among the specimens gathered from the site of Afontova Gora III in the collection of I. T. Savenkov, a large disk made of agalmatolite attracted atten- tion. Its flat surface was decorated by lines extend- ing radially from the center, and these were crossed by a round line which circumscribed it near the pe- rimeter (PI. LIX: 12). The diameter of the disk is 6 cm. Sosnovskii proposes that this disk had some kind of cult significance (Sosnovskii 1934:255-256, Fig. 6, 1935:149). The remaining objects from this site are fully analogous with those of the Afontova Gora II site: a ball of mammoth ivory (Auerbakh 1930:28, PI. 10: 3), flat pendants and beads made of agalmatolite (ibid., PI. 9:7, 8), tubular beads of long bones (ibid., PI. 9:1, 2), and drilled teeth of the polar fox and deer (ibid., PI. 9:3-6). 49. Oshurkovo This site is situated on the left bank of the Selenga River about 18 kilometers below the city of Ulan-Ude. A unique stone pendant, triangular in form and with rounded edges and corners, was dis- covered during the excavations of Okladnikov and E. A. Khamzinaia in 1958 (Pis. LVI:12 and LIX:9). A small, bifacially drilled opening is located on the apex. The pendant is flat, and its edges are cov- ered with deep transverse cuts placed at intervals of 2-3 mm. from one another. There are lightly en- graved, thin striations going in various directions on both of the flat, carefully polished surfaces. The soft stone from which it was fashioned is apparently agalmatolite, and it has a warm reddish brown color. The dimensions of the pendant are: height, 3.5 cm.; width (at the base), 2.7 cm.; thickness, 0.4 cm. (Abramova 1960b:37, PI. 4:1). In addition to this, a fragment of a slotted bone tool was also found here (PI. LIX: 11). Length, 9.7 cm.; width, 2 cm. There is a design consisting of thin carved lines which form zigzags on one of its flat surfaces (Okladnikov 1959b, PI. VI:4). 50. Shishkino A special place in the Palaeolithic art of Si- beria is occupied by the cliff portrayals of animals - wild horses and bulls - discovered among the petroglyphs by Okladnikov on the Shishkino cliff, Arctic Anthropology IV-2 located on the right bank of the Lena River 18 kilo- meters below Kachug. These portrayals are executed in contour with red pigment and have quite large di- mensions. Thus the first figure of a horse has a length of 2.8 m. and a height of 1.5 m. (PL XLIII:9). It has a massive, relatively wide body and a large, sagging belly. The head is distinguished by the characteristic aquiline nose. The muzzle is short and is outlined by a smoothly flowing convex curved line. Since the horse is portrayed strictly in profile, only one front and one back leg can be seen. The lines of the back with its smoothly outlined croup can be traced for almost its full length. The tail is portrayed by means of two thick lines which separate widely as they descend. Special emphasis was placed on the sex of this horse (Okladnikov 1949:156, Fig. 3; Okladnikov and Zaporozhskaia 1959, PL XXXVIII). The second portrayal of a horse is similar to the first, but has considerably smaller dimensions plus a few differences in detail and proportion (PL XLIIL8). Length, 1.18 m.; height, 64 cm. It has also been portrayed in profile. The body has the same massive heaviness; the belly has been drawn as a wide arch. The nose is aquiline and the mouth is well expressed. The legs were drawn schematically, their lower parts being in a poor state of preservation and the tail has been reproduced in a similar manner, that is, by two parallel lines terminating by an oblique cut (Okladnikov 1949:163, Fig. 6; Okladnikov and Zaporozhskaia 1959, PL XXXVII). The third portrayal - a wild bull - has been repro- duced by the same technique and style as were the drawings of the horses (PL XUII:7). Its length is 1.12 m., and the width is 0.55 m. It is sketched in contour with red paint; the lines themselves are wide. The legs are portrayed in solid color. This bull is also shown in rigid profile (Okladnikov 1949:165, Fig. 9; Okladnikov and Zaporozhskaia 1959, PL XX). Okladnikov, who made the discovery of these portrayals, which were unusual petroglyphs for Si- beria, offered convincing proof that they belonged to the Palaeolithic period. It represented the first painted picture connected with those times found not only in Siberia, but within the entire U.S.S.R. 51. Ust'-Kanskaia A fragment of a thin bone pendant discovered by S. I. Rudenko in the Ust'-Kanskaia Cave repre- sents the sole specimen of art found in the Palaeo- lithic sites of the Altai Mountains (PL LIX: 7). This pendant has an oval form and has been thoroughly polished. There is a round opening on each end al- though the walls of one have been partially broken off. Fine cuts were carved along the edge of the outer side. The dimensions: 1.8X1 cm. (Rudenko I960, Fig. 19:9).</page><page sequence="65">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 52. Talitskii's Site Individual art objects have been discovered in the Urals at Talitskii's Site. A piece of a mammoth rib (length, 19 cm.) came from the surface finds. On one end there is a decorative design composed of carved transverse lines closely arranged. Short parallel cuts radiate from the last line (Talitskii 1940:140, Fig. 1). M. V. Talitskii stated that it is not definitely known whether this decorated object 65 came from the lens of the cultural level or not. A thin slab of slate also belongs to this surface ma- terial. Wide transverse stripes of red pigment were deliberately applied, two on one side, and one on the other (Talitskii 1940:140, Fig. 2). Traces of the same kind of stripes can be observed on another piece of slate found in the cultural level (Talitskii 1940:140). A thin plate of bone with transverse parallel cuts is in the collection at the Hermitage (PI. LIX:10). CLASSIFICATION OF THE SPECIMENS OF PALAEOLITHIC ART All artifacts having artistic value from Palaeo- lithic sites may be divided into the following groups: 1 ) Anthropomorphic portrayals 2) Zoomorphic portrayals 3) Carved objects 4) Decorated objects Before turning our attention to the character- istics of these groups, we will pause for a moment to make some observations of a general nature. Materials and the Technique of Workmanship . The material most widely used in the manufacture of art objects in the U.S.S.R. was mammoth ivory, a sub- stance possessing excellent technical properties. Bones of animals and antler were utilized to a con- siderably lesser degree. During the Palaeolithic there was a wide use of marl in the Kostenki Dis- trict. Figurines of animals and women as well as ornaments were fashioned from it. Other kinds of soft stone, such as serpentine and agalmatolite were employed in the manufacture of ornaments in other areas. M. M. Gerasimov (1941:65-85), M. D. Gvoz- dover (1953:192-198), and S. A. Semenov ( 1957: 1 75- 194) have written about the elementary stages in the processing of mammoth ivory, bone, and antler. Finished artifacts made of this material were often so completely covered by design that it is almost impossible to form a judgment about the methods of fabrication. The materials from Kostenki I allow one to re- trace each stage of the fabrication from the crude blanks to the carefully finished figurines with smoothed and even polished surfaces. The best specimens of female figurines from Kostenki I - the largest and most fully preserved - were made of mammoth ivory. However, there are in all only four examples of these. The rest of the mass of carved artifacts, both the portrayals of animals and of women, were found for the most part in a fragmented condition, and they had been made of marl. In addition to this, there are a great number of artifacts from Kostenki I made of mammoth ivory which were used as tools (mattocks, polishers) or which served an uncertain function, possibly cere- monial. Apparently the preparation of objects from mammoth ivory demanded a very great expenditure of labor, and for this reason tusks were used only for the largest and most valuable artifacts. Figurines of this material were made with special care, great attention being given to the depiction of their vari- ous supplementary details such as shoulder belts, waist belts, bracelets, and headdresses, a care which is very rarely observed on the figurines made of marl. This same thoroughness of working can be seen on other objects made of mammoth ivory. In the majority of cases, common artifacts made of marl were executed with less care, not as large in their dimensions, and were considerably more sche- matic. Soft marl is obviously far easier to work with than the solid ivory which had to be subjected to a preliminary softening at the very onset. Because of its structure, ivory peels off into separate plates easily, while marl only weathers slightly on its sur- face. The marl used for this purpose was a dense variety of chalk, most frequently of a gray color with yellow or rosy overtones. The various sculptured marl artifacts may be divided into the following groups with a considerable degree of reliability: a) Blanks in their initial stages of preparation b) Artifacts on which the working was incomplete, and which are distinguished by a degree of schematism c) Artifacts which are complete in form, but lack the finishing touches d) Fully completed figurines Traces of the various stages of fabrication can be observed on the surface of a number of finished artifacts: wide carving facets, long, narrow cuts, and small striations from the smoothing and polish- ing. Processing of marl was widely done in other sites in the Kostenki District. The quality of marl used at the Aleksandrovka Site (Kostenki IV) in the upper horizon was not as good as that used at Kos- tenki I. Its color ranged from a yellowish to a rosy gray, and if the surface had been weathered at all it took on an ashen hue. The method used during the preparation of animal figurines and other artifacts</page><page sequence="66">66 was as follows: long, fairly wide cuts were em- ployed in order to attain an even surface, the lines of the facets scraped off, then the surface was smoothed off and finally polished. The polishing is very clearly noticeable even on tiny fragments. In the majority of cases the surfaces are rough because of poor preservation, and very often they apparently had only been smoothed, not polished. Marl objects from Aleksandrovka were small in size. Even smaller artifacts of marl were found in the second level at Anosovka II. The marl here was of a gray color, sometimes with yellowish hues. The preservation is poor; this may be due to the inferior quality of the marl, or to what appears to be the re- sult of weathering or even to damage after manu- facture. The surface of figurines looks as though it had been washed away, partly covered with a limey accumulation plus other defects. In Anosovka II, the technique involved in the preparation of the figurines was very simple; the majority of works have a fairly regular hemispherical form with evenly cut bases which were smoothed. Traces of polish- ing could not be observed. Gerasimov has noted that in general the sites of the Kostenki area are characterized by the presence of polished artifacts and slabs of sandy slate which served as polishing stones (Gerasimov 1941:73). Polished bone objects have been discovered in many sites on the Russian plain - Gagarino and Mezin, for example - but the technique of polishing bone was unknown at Mal'ta, and polishing stones are also absent from that site (Gerasimov 1941:73). Style. In the descriptions of the Palaeolithic fe- male figurines or the painted figures of animals in west European cave paintings, scholars are unani- mous in noting the astonishing realism of these por- trayals. The sculptured figurines of women and animals found in the Palaeolithic sites of the U. S.S.R. are equally characterized by a realistic style, and this fact is just as indisputable and dis- tinctive as in the West. Basically, this style un- doubtedly deserves the appellation of primitive realism, the initial step in ancient art. With an amazing fidelity to nature, Palaeolithic man reproduced those features which were most es- sential and characteristic of the forms portrayed by him. He drew only that which in his eyes had an important meaning, and he ignored other details which from our point of view would be no less es- sential. The figurines of women are realistic in that they accentuate the features of maturity in the Woman-Mother. The over-exaggeration of the Arctic Anthropology IV-2 swollen form of the breasts and thighs were counter- balanced by the summary treatment of the face and a primitive rendition of the hands and feet. The figurines of mammoths and other animals were more schematized, but their general contours are rendered so characteristically and precisely that there can be no doubt of the species identification. As to the realism of the animal portrayals, one only needs to be reminded of the description of the head of a lion- ess from Kostenki I. The sketchiness of other animal figurines and heads of animals, though, is more pro- nounced than on the portrayals of women. Neverthe- less, the eyes and ears on some of the heads were often deliberately emphasized. All these portrayals are a clear testimony to the Palaeolithic stone engraver's ability to observe well and to keenly sense the world around him. It is also a testimony to their strong visual memory. A few strokes were sufficient to distinctly portray for us the majestic figure of a mammoth or the widebrowed muzzle of a bear. The originality of primitive realism lay in the ability to do this. Far greater potentiali- ties for artistic reproductions of animals lie in the portrayal of an animal with delicate shadings of paint, for example, as seen in the paintings of Alta- mira or Lascaux, than in the plastic shaping of mam- moth ivory or soft stone. To be sure, the schematism of these works of art cannot be explained only by the properties of the material. The most important thing, in our view- point, is the subject matter of these artifacts and the purpose for which they were produced. Along with the realistic elements in the creations of the Palaeolithic master, there are also traits of schematization and conventionalization, symbolical ornamental motifs, and crude, grotesque portrayals. It would be incorrect to regard the various elements of stylization as signs of decline or weakness. It would be more correct to look on these convention- alized portrayals (such as the "medallions" from Kostenki I) as corresponding to a definite complex of ideas which were already elaborate. Consequently, one may regard them as evidence of the progress of abstract activity of the human mind, the growth of definite abstract concepts. Although these elements contradict the realistic traits of Palaeolithic art, they are still inseparable from them. In such a manner the range of the flexible ex- pression of diverse ideas in Palaeolithic art varies from primitive realism to stylized portrayals of an abstract nature.</page><page sequence="67">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 67 1. ANTHROPOMORPHIC PORTRAYALS As we have just seen from the description of the art objects, the basic subject matter of the imi- tative creations of primitive man in the U.S.S.R. seems to have been women and animals. There are an unusually great number of carved female por- trayals - 130 examples which include fragments of torsos, detached heads, and clearly expressed blanks. These sculptured portrayals of women oc- cupy first place in the Palaeolithic art of the U.S.S.R., not only because of their numbers, but also because of their perfection of execution and the value these ancient people attached to them. A definite, indisputable portrayal of a man has yet to be found in the Palaeolithic of the U.S.S.R. There are a great number of characteristics by which these figurines may be classified in detail. To begin with, they can be separated into realistic, conventionalized, and stylized. We will first dis- cuss the realistic figurines and take note of their general form. The first unifying characteristic of the figurines, and this includes a great many from western Europe, is the fact that they all portray nude women. The only exception to this are the figurines from Siberia (Mal'ta and Buret1); the overwhelming majority of figurines were depicting naked women, and only these five figurines represented as wear- ing fur clothing have been observed. The second general feature appears to be the special character of the realistic rendition of the body form with its exaggeration of details. There is emphasis on the female-maternal characteristics of the majority of figurines: the voluminous, loose hanging breasts, the round abdomen, and the wide thighs. The third feature is the peculiar canonically stable pose of the figurines: the severely frontal depiction, the head slightly bowed downwards, and the shortened legs tightly pressed together at the knees. One may distinguish two local variants which belong to the group of realistic figurines - the East European and the Siberian; each possesses its own peculiarities. Within these two regional variants, figurines may be divided according to their types: I. Figurines which to a greater or lesser degree correspond to the normal anatomical structure of a woman's body, that is, classical proportions; II. Those whose proportions are elongated and slen- der; III. Those whose proportions correspond to those of an obese, short-statured woman; IV. Figu- rines which are distinguished by their generalized outlines (PI. LXI). It should be stipulated here that this division is conditional, and that there are transitional forms also. Part of the figurines which fall out of this division are included in a special sub-group for those having individual characteristics. Subse- quently, whole figurines may be separated by size (large or small), by the material from which they were made (mammoth ivory, antler, bone, marl, or other type of stone), by the decoration which evidently should denote various elements of clothing and adorn- ment. We will examine the fragments of the figurines in the following order: heads, torsos and parts of torsos, and the lower parts. In accordance with this plan, we will now dis- cuss the differences between the East European and Siberian figurines. To begin with, in the Siberian group one is struck by the abundance of whole and almost whole figurines; from the total number of known figurines (33 specimens in all), 24 of them are whole (in other words, 75%), while only 9 of them represent fragments or blanks. At the same time at Kostenki I, however, of the 53 specimens, only 6 were intact, i.e., approximately 10%. Out of the total number of 67 specimens in eastern Europe in general, only 12 were whole. The Siberian figurines are com- : pletely different from the East European both in pro- portions and treatment. The women portrayed by the East European figurines have exaggerated sexual features: the voluminous breasts which sag down onto the bulging abdomen, the massive obesity of the hips which are emphasized even on the so-called lean figurines. On the other hand, the Siberian figu- rines do not have this exaggeration of form: more often than not, the breasts are designated in weak relief by a shallow carved line, the thighs broaden insignificantly, and the buttocks, which are elevated high on the back, are not wide. Regarding the differences of proportion, the heads of the East European figurines are always smaller than the torso, while those of the Siberian figurines are usually equal by volume to the thorax, and, at the same time, the legs and lower part of the torso are disproportionately long. The heads of the Siberian figurines were given especially great atten- tion. In a number of cases they are covered with various decorations in the form of straight, wavy or zigzag lines, furrows, and round or crescent-shaped cuts. Now and then one comes across a decorative pattern on the heads of the East European specimens, but the level of development and perfection is not the same here. In this respect as well as in a num- ber of others, the Siberian figurines have a formal similarity to those of western and central Europe. We must not forget, however, the carefully executed designs on the heads of the Venuses of Willendorf (Austria), Brassempouy (France), and Grimaldi (Italy). Not one of the East European figurines is marked with facial features, yet a number of Siberian figu- rines have clearly designated features on their oval faces - the brows, chin, nose, and even the eyes</page><page sequence="68">68 and mouth. The latter is seldom seen on foreign figurines, with the exception of one fully and dis- tinctly drawn face on a head from Dolni Vestonice, Czechoslovakia, called "Leonardo da Vinci" (Absolon 1949a: 210, Fig. 8). There is another face whose features are less distinctly indicated, on the "neg- roid" head from Grimaldi (Piette 1902:7, Fig. 3), plus the "head in a cowl" from Brassempouy which is splendidly executed in every other respect ex- cept for the face on which only the brows and nose have been outlined (Piette 1895:149-150, PI. V:2, 2a). Another peculiarity of the Siberian figurines is the presence of all-over design on five of them which represents, as we have already stated, cloth- ing. There is no analogy to this phenomenon in either western or eastern Europe, nor is there any analogy to the drilled openings in the lower part of the legs. On the other hand, it is impossible not to notice the strange concurrence of forms between certain Siberian and West European figurines. There is one of these from Buret1 (No. 5) which by its general form, treatment, proportions, and lack of details closely resembles the figurine from Brassem- pouy called "La fillette" (Piette 1907, PI. LXXIV:4). A stylized figurine from Kostenki II, though larger by dimensions, resembles both of the figurines mentioned above. On the other hand, a figurine which was found accidently in Chiozza di Scandiano (Italy) possesses many traits which greatly re- semble those on some of the figurines from Mal'ta (Graziosi 1943). Types of Figurines . The East European figurines, as we have already stated, may be divided into four types. I. The classical type portraying a woman of a regu- lar bodily structure despite slight exaggeration of the form. The most striking representatives of this type are the Kostenki figurines made of mammoth ivory. Of these, only one is whole, while the heads and lower ends of the legs have been broken off on the other three. Figurines of this type are char- acterized by generally slender proportions. The full, semi-oval breasts reach down to the upper part of the abdomen; the latter has a moderate bulge and the hips are proportionately wide; the buttocks do not extend around to the sides, but merge into the lines of the back; the thighs have normal propor- tions, tapering off smoothly to the knees. The shins, what there is left of them, are disproportionately short and small. The thin, short arms which are lying either on the abdomen or under the breasts, are likewise disproportionate. It is interesting to note that all four of these figurines have various kinds of decorative ornaments. The closest analogy to this type of female figurine from a foreign country is the female figurine made of mammoth ivory from Dolni Vestonice, Arctic Anthropology IV-2 Czechoslovakia (Absolon 1949a:205-206, Fig. 1). In spite of the great conventionalization of the re- production and the presence of other decorative motifs, it possesses the same characteristic features as do the Kostenki figurines. Even more interesting is the fact that there is a still closer analogy to this type of figurine in the bas-relief in the cave of Laussel (Lalanne 1912). II. The lean type which portrays a women of elon- gated but slender proportions with a long, thin torso and legs. Figurines No. 1 from Avdeevo and No. 3 from Gagarino represent this type of figurine. They have a surprising resemblance to each other, differ- ing only in dimensions: the Avdeevo figurine is larger than the one from Gagarino by almost 10 cm., and it is also somewhat more flattened. * They are characterized by small heads and sloping shoulders. The loose-hanging breasts rest on the upper part of the abdomen, the latter bulges slightly, and the hips widen almost imperceptibly. The line of the back is flat except for a bend only at the waist. The long, thin legs are tightly pressed together at the thighs, and separate slightly above the knees; the calves are well shaped. The legs of both figurines were broken off near the ankles. A further development of this type can be seen in the figurine from Eliseevichi: it is large and has drawn out proportions. The breasts are small, semi- oval, and protrude only slightly; the torso is thin and the abdomen does not bulge. In comparison with the previous figurines, the buttocks on this one pro- trude considerably. The thighs and shins have smooth lines bending at the knees. The legs, which are held together, are divided by a vertical line; the lower part has been broken off. One can see these same features on a figurine from Laugerie Basse called "The Shameless Venus" (Piette 1907, PI. VII:1). It portrays the extreme ex- pression of the lean type among West European figu- rines. This same type of slender woman can be ob- served on figurines from the sites of Petrkovice (Klima 1955, Pis. II-III) and Pavlov (Klima 1957a, Fig. 17) in Czechoslovakia, which were in a broken condition when found. Certain figurines from Bras- sempouy and Grimaldi are also close to this type. III. The obese type distinguished by its widened and shortened proportions. It is represented by two figurines (Nos. 1 and 2) from the East European site of Gagarino. These figurines are just as wide in pro- A mistake has been made here, probably on the part of the type setter. Both the analogy and the description obviously do not correspond with Gagarino Figurine No. 3 (PI. XXV). It is more prob- able that Figurine No. 4 was meant (also PI. XXV). - Trans.</page><page sequence="69">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. file as they are en face. The massive, round breasts rest on a bulging abdomen; the hips look as though they had been pulled out on the sides. The legs of one of the figurines have been broken off on the up- per part of the thighs, but those of the other one are whole, even though disproportionately thin. The arms are also thin; they are concealed under the breasts on one of the figurines and elevated toward the face on the other. The nearest analogy to these figurines, espe- cially the first one, is the Venus of Willendorf (Austria), which is larger in size (Szombathy 1910). Its proportions are extremely close to those of the Gagarino figurines: the comparatively massive head decorated with concentric rows of little protuber- ances, the round heavy breasts lying on the volu- minous abdomen, and the extremely broad hips. There is essential difference only in the position of the arms; they are bent at the elbows and then placed over the breasts. A figurine made of yellow steatite from Grimaldi is close to this type both in dimensions and propor- tions (Reinach 1898). Fragments of two figurines from Brassempouy are also distinguished by these same features (Piette 1895:143-144, Pis. I-III). IV. Figurines of generalized outlines. They un- doubtedly portray women, but the breasts and ab- domen are not delineated and are rendered only in general fashion. Two clay figurines from Kostenki I (Nos. 5 and 6) and one from Avdeevo (No. 2) are representatives of this type. They are distinguished by their general massiveness of form which can be seen even on the smallest one (No. 6). The huge head is placed on the bulky torso on which there is almost no neck. The low hanging breasts and ab- domen merge together as one, and this combination bulges to the extreme on the smaller figurines. That part of the legs which is still intact on the larger figurines has been shaped. The fact that the Avdee- vo figurine was not completed is not to be entirely ruled out; this possibility is evidenced by the care- ful processing on the right leg. The division of the Siberian figurines into types presents certain difficulties since there are only a few distinct characteristics to go by, while on the contrary, there are many transitional forms. Never- theless, it is still possible, though conditionally, to single out the same four types which the East European figurines represent while at the same time adding to them those which have individual features such as the overall designs that are a possible por- trayal of clothed women. The establishment of these East European types among the Siberian figu- rines does not in the least signify that there is a resemblance between these two provinces since each type possesses its own specific local pecu- liarities. I. A type of woman with the most regular propor- 69 tions. The heads are either less than or almost equal to the size of the thorax. The breasts are small and loose hanging, and the hips are propor- tionately wide. The arms and legs are of normal length. This type is represented by figurines from Mal'ta - Nos. 9, 1, 7, 6, 11. Figurine No. 9 is the most proportional of these. The head is decorated and there is an ornamental band in the region of the hips. This figurine is the only one of its kind since the others representing type I possess somewhat different features. Three of them (Nos. 1, 7, 6) resemble each other (especially Nos. 1 and 7) both in proportions and treatment. They also bear a slight resemblance to Figurine No. 8 of Type II. At this point we should mention those figurines with certain individual features, for example, No. 24 from Mal'ta. The upper part is massive and the legs are short. The distinctive feature of this figurine is its clearly delineated face. It has a resemblance to Figurine No. 3 from Buret' but the latter also differs from it in a few details. II. A type of woman with lean, elongated proportions. The figurines which we have assigned to this type possess different peculiarities which may be con- sidered separately. The single true representative of this type is Figurine No. 8 from Mal'ta: the head is large and in volume it is equal to the torso. The legs are long and are reduced to an inverted cone, the apex of which is rounded off as on Figurine No. 6 of Type I. Three other figurines may be conditionally regarded as belonging to this type II. No. 10 from Mal'ta has the appearance of a shaft with only the head and extremities shaped in. Only the head and legs can be made out on Figurine No. 4, also from Mal'ta. The legs are divided by a line. In all other respects, however, it looks like a shaft, oblong in section. The miniature figurine (No. 5) from Buret1, already referred to by us, is round in section and the various parts of the body have been reproduced in a sketchy manner. III. A type of figurine with widened proportions, especially in the region of the hips. Nos. 23, 5 and 2 from Mal'ta can be placed in this category. The breasts are portrayed as quite full on two of these; the arms are resting on the abdomen concealing it. On Figurine No. 5, however, the bulge of the abdomen has been accentuated. All three of these figurines have wide hips, and the legs, which are pressed to- gether, are reduced to a cone. IV. This type of figurine has generalized outlines. No. 4 from Buret1 and No. 28 from Mal'ta can be in- cluded in this category. They appear to be unfinished figurines with proportions averaging somewhere be- tween the normal and stout types. In general, figu- rines of this kind should be classified with those which have shaped body parts, but no indication of breasts, but certain of these we have discussed in</page><page sequence="70">70 other categories. Those falling into other divisions are: No. 3 from Buret1, Nos. 7 and 5 from Mal'ta. From their general outlines, there is no doubt that they portray women. V. Figurines entirely covered by designs which, from all indications, represent clothing. Five such specimens are known to date: one from Buret1 and four from Mal'ta, including a number of fragments. Two of them are covered with rows of crescent- shaped cuts, three of them are covered with trans- verse round cuts. Measurements of the Figurines. The height of the East European whole or almost whole figurines var- ies from 4.2 cm. (Kostenki I, No. 6) to 17.5 cm. (Kostenki I, No. 4). Large figurines come from the sites of Kostenki I (Nos. 2, 4, 5), from Avdeevo (No. 1), and from Eliseevichi. Figurines Nos. 1 and 3 from Kostenki I have an average height of 9 and 11.4 cm. The Gagarino figurines are rather short. The thin ones reach a height of 7.1 cm. and the stout ones, from 5.5 to 5.8 cm. It is a different story in Siberia. The very smallest one (Mal'ta, No. 12) has a height of 3.7 cm. and the largest is only 13.6 cm. The height of the other figurines from Mal'ta and Buret1 varies be- tween these figures. Thus, we see that the height of whole figurines in the U. S.S.R. varies between 3.7 and 17.5 cm. The female figurines from Central Europe have a moderate size of 1 1 cm. In Western Europe they vary from 4 cm. (Grimaldi) to 22.5 cm. (Savignano). Thus the largest Palaeolithic figurine in the world (a chance find, it is true) reaches a height of 22.5 cm. (Vaufrey 1926). Materials . The figurines were made of diverse ma- terials - mammoth ivory, antler, bone, marl, and, in individual cases, other types of soft stone. Mam- moth ivory was used the most often. All the large whole figurines were fashioned from this material - from Kostenki I, all the figurines from Gagarino, Avdeevo, the figurines from Eliseevich, and almost all the figurines from Mal'ta and Buret1. Marl was used only at Kostenki I. Some individual specimens were made of other materials. There is a schematic figurine made of bone from Kostenki II, a figurine of reindeer antler from Mal'ta, and another one made of serpentine from Buret1. Mammoth ivory was the favorite material for many of the most perfect specimens of figurines in both Western and Central Europe. At the same time, quite a number of them were made from other ma- terials, chiefly stone; figurines from Grimaldi were 'made of steatite, a figurine from Savignano (Italy) from serpentine, the "Venus" of Willendorf from fine grained limestone, and fragments of figurines from Linzenberg (Germany) from soft stone (Neeb 1924), etc. An unusual material, hematite (red iron), was used in Petrkovice, and a fired clay mass was used in both Dolni Ve stonice and Pavlov. Arctic Anthropology IV-2 It is interesting to note that all the fragments of female figurines from Kostenki I had been fashioned from marl of various qualities, colors, and in differ- ent stages of preservation, and that only four of the better figurines which were still completely intact were made of mammoth ivory. All of the animal figu- rines from this same site were also made of marl, but mammoth ivory was widely employed for the prep- aration of various carved objects of uncertain func- tion, as well as for objects with a utilitarian purpose. Design. The design on a number of figurines consists of various cuts, hachures and indentations. They can be seen as details of clothing or as objects of adorn- ment - belts, bands, bracelets, necklaces and loin- cloths. The heads are sometimes carefully decorated by short, round cuts or indentations probably repre- senting hairdos or headdresses. As we have already noted, a number of Siberian figurines have portrayed women as completely attired in some kind of pull- over clothing like a combination suit (Okladnikov 1941b; Abramova 1960a). Fragments of Figurines. We will examine these by territorial groups (PI. LXII). Twenty-five fragments of Palaeolithic figurines in the form of individual heads were found in the East European group. Twenty- three of these came from Kostenki I, while only one questionable one came from Suponevo. All of the heads from Kostenki I (which sometimes had part of the neck and shoulders on them) were made of marl; the largest of these reaches a height of 5.8 cm. and has a diameter of 5.2 cm. - the largest of all known heads. The dimensions of the majority of heads do not exceed 2 cm. Fragments of torsos in Eastern Europe are en- countered in Kostenki I and Gagarino. These are most frequently found in the form of individual breasts or fragments of them with the adjoining sections of the back and arms. All of them, with the exception of two fragments, belong to small figurines. Fragments of the lower parts from the waist on down, or even a pair of legs, were also found at these two sites. The lower part of a torso from Kostenki I (No. 25 from the excavations of Krukovskii) has a marked similarity to fragments from Gagarino. Some of the leg fragments showed that they had been reduced to a simple cone, and on other occasions they were marked with a line to show a separation between them. The least number of fragments, significantly, were found in Siberia. They consist of three heads and two fragments of torsos, all from Mal'ta. We have mentioned the heads from foreign sites, Dolni Vestonice, Grimaldi, and Brassempouy. All of them were painstakingly made, each one a masterpiece in its own right. The recently discovered head from Pavlov, with its spherical or mushroom-like shape (Klima 1957b, Fig. 64), has a pronounced similarity to the Kostenki I heads.</page><page sequence="71">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. Fragments representing a detached breast are unknown in West European sites. The only excep- tion to this appears to be some individual artifacts from Dolni Ve stonice where women's breasts were found made of mammoth ivory in the form of complete stylized objects, done apparently on the principle of "a part instead of the whole." Parts of torsos are known from the sites of Dolni Vestonice, Petrkovice, Lopata, Pavlov (Czechoslovakia), La Ferassie (France), and Linzenberg (Germany). A great many fragments of torsos and lower extremities were dis- covered at Brassempouy. They were made of mam- moth ivory and are distinguished by the thorough- ness of their finishing touches. Also of interest are the little fragments repre- senting human legs, often with feet on them, which were made of fired clay. They were found at Pavlov. Complete figurines having feet are extremely rare. Stylized Figurines. Stylized figurines of women occupy a noteworthy place in the Palaeolithic art of the U.S.S.R. - much more important, in fact, than is generally thought. These figurines are different, since they are often highly schematized and quite inexpressive, and they are apparently linked with a particular set of concepts held by primitive man. With some reservations, it is possible to divide them into three groups. 1) Seated or semi-seated figurines from Kostenki I, Avdeevo and Krasnyi IAr; 2) Stylized figurines with geometric designs from Mezin; and 3) Shaft-like figurines from Kostenki II and Buref; several figurines with the appearance of oblong shafts are known in Mal'ta, but they are distin- guished by the realistic execution of the decora- tive designs on the head. Stylized female figurines, differing both in form and execution, are known in any number of Palaeolithic sites in Western Europe. They date from the Aurignacian up to and including the Mag- dalenian. A single discovery of a realistically exe- cuted, seated figurine was made during the last few years at the site of Pavlov in Czechoslovakia (Klima 1958, Fig. 1). The conventionalized seated figurine from Kostenki I resembles the Pavlov specimen only in its treatment of the thighs. The differently treated seated figurine from Avdeevo is a very close analogy to a figurine from Predmost, however. The latter was made from bone from a mammoth's foot (Kuhn 1926, PI. 4, Fig. 12). A crudely executed figurine made of deer antler and found in the cave of Trou Margate in Belgium is close in general out- lines to the figurine mentioned earlier (Dupont 18 71: 32-33, 92-93, Fig. 7 on page 37). And, finally, it would not be amiss to include a conventionally re- produced figurine from Krasnyi IAr which is similar to the series of the stylized portrayals found at the site of Pekarna in Czechoslovakia (Absolon and 71 Czizek 1932:574, PI. XXII:9), and Petersfels, Germany (Peters 1930, PI. 31, Figs. 1-4). Stylized pendants from Petersfels have no details whatsoever, but their contours are unquestionably those of a woman's figure, even though strangely treated. The middle part of their bodies are sharply bent just like a human who is sitting or is about to sit. They differ from the figurine from Krasnyi IAr by their smooth round outlines and the presence of an opening in the upper part for suspension. The height of these figurines is not too great (3-4 cm.). By their proportions, some of the Mezin figurines closely re- semble some of the stylized figurines from Upper Palaeolithic sites in the West, for example, the one from Magdalenian levels in the cave at Mauern in Germany (Zotz 1951). Efimenko thinks that the acci- dental discovery at Sirenil in France (Breuil and Pevronv 1930), which West European scholars have assigned to the Aurignacian, should belong to the Magdalenian. Regarding these simplified figurines, one should be reminded that, along with the realistic engravings from the caves of Laugerie Basse, Isturitz (Saint- Perier 1932:23-25, Fig. 2), and La Madeleine in France (Breuil 1954), there are also stylized engraved por- trayals in the West which are close in profile to the figurines from Petersfels and Krasnyi IAr, for example, or from the sites of La Roche (Peyrony 1930), Hohlen- stein (Birkner 1928), and Fontales (Darasse 1956). All this testifies to the fact that the image of woman continued to play an essential role in the cosmological outlook of the primitive hunter not only in the Aurignacian but also during the later phases of the Upper Palaeolithic. In this way the image of woman did not disappear during the Magda- lenian, but developed in carving, engraving, and painting toward greater schematization and sim- plicity. On the other hand, portrayals of anthropomorphic masks were not characteristic of only the Magdalenian of the West. They existed side by side with the re- alistic female figurines in such sites as Kostenki I and Dolni Vestonice during the middle part of the Upper Palaeolithic. Two anthropomorphic heads from Dolni Vestonice, made of fired clay which had been mixed with crushed bone, are very close in general appearance to the masks from Kostenki I. These gro- tesque faces, by the way, do not have anything in common with the realistic head made of mammoth ivory that was found in that same level. A similar head, semi-animal and semi-human, was found in the Aurignacian level in the cave of La Ferrassie. They were executed in the bas-relief technique, making use of the natural contours of fragments of limestone. This closely resembles the technique of execution of some of the anthropomorphic marl heads from Kostenki I. It is interesting to note that on the reverse side of this fragment there is an engraved</page><page sequence="72">72 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 female sex symbol. There is a possibility that there A great number of engravings which portray sim- is some kind of a connection between these two- ilar anthropomorphic masks also belong to the Mag- sided portrayals. dalenian Period. 2. ZOOMORPHIC PORTRAYALS Animal images have no less a role in Palaeo- lithic art than those of women, and if reckoned by numbers alone they occupy first place in the West. In Western, and especially Southwestern, Europe the greater portion of the animal portrayals repre- sent the herbivores - bison, deer, horse - and more rarely the mammoth. They existed as colored wall paintings and engravings or bas-reliefs which some- times formed vast panels or friezes, or they were found in the form of engravings on individual slabs of stone or bone fragments and sometimes, though not too often, as sculptures, discovered principally in cave sites. In the U.S.S.R. , on the contrary, Palaeolithic wall paintings are virtually unknown with the single exception of the individual por- trayals of horses and cattle on the Shishkino Cliffs.* The great bulk of animal portrayals in the U.S.S.R. belonging to the Upper Palaeolithic exist in the form of carvings which represent the mam- moth, rhinoceros, bison, cave lion, bear, wolf, and even certain birds. There is also one schematized portrayal of a fish. Some of these sculptures of animals are difficult to define, but there is a possi- bility that they were intended to portray the horse, goat, sheep, and saiga. Realistic carvings of ani- mals have also been found in Western, and espe- cially Central European sites, but in all, a com- paratively few species of animals are represented. Portrayals of Mammoths. At the present time over thirty carved portrayals of mammoths belonging to the Upper Palaeolithic have been found in the U.S.S.R. Nearly all of them came from the sites in the Kostenki district - Kostenki I, Aleksandrovka, and Anosovka II. One carving was found at the ' The dating of certain petroglyphs at Zaraut- Sai (Central Asia) will remain in question until such time as there is a full report about this site. Con- sidering the fact that some of the drawings at Kamennaia Moglia (Black Sea area) were earlier considered as being Palaeolithic, the majority of researchers at the present time have assigned it to a much later period. Thus, extreme interest has been aroused by the discovery within the past few years of an excellent site of Palaeolithic paintings, consisting of drawings of the mammoth, rhinoceros, and horse in Kapova Cave in the Ural Mountains. Z. Abramova. [See Arctic Anthropology, Vol. 3, No. 1, pp. 77-90. - Ed.] Adveevo site near Kursk and still another engraved on a large plate of mammoth ivory was discovered at Mal'ta.** Outside the borders of the U.S.S.R., a few Palaeo- lithic figurines of the mammoth have been encountered in several central European sites. Drawings and en- gravings of this animal are seen fairly often in the Palaeolithic art of Western Europe, but they are far outnumbered by portrayals of ungulates. In general, one does not come across analogies to the figurines from the Kostenki area, but one mammoth figurine from Avdeevo bears a surprising resemblance to a figurine from Predmost not only in its general con- tours, but in style and dimensions as well, differing from it only in material (Ma ska, Obermaier and Breuil 1912). An engraving of a mammoth from Mal'ta has a great similarity with certain engraved portrayals in western Europe, specifically, an engraving on a fragment of mammoth ivory from La Madeleine (Lartet and Christy 1875, PI. B, XXVIII, p. 168). The predominance of mammoth portrayals in East European sites apparently reflects the real picture of the distribution of this animal and the role it played in the economic life of the Upper Palaeolithic hunters. The mammoth was relatively rare at that time in the West, while numerous herds of these huge, powerful animals roamed the boundless steppes of Central and Eastern Europe. Along with the wooly rhinoceros, the mammoth was one of the most char- acteristic and typical faunal representatives of the Ice Age. The major significance of the mammoth in the life of the Palaeolithic community is attested by the fact that their skeletal remains in the majority of Upper Palaeolithic sites on the East European plain form enormous accumulations. Even in excava- tions of comparatively small size, the bones of dozens of individuals are counted. Thus, the bones of 70 individuals were found at the Kirillovskaia site, 65 at Pushkari I, 53 at Gontsy, 35 at Berdizh, 20 at Novgorod-Severskii, 15 at Chulatov, and so on. During the course of only one year's excavations, the Eliseevichi site yielded the bones of over thirty individual mammoths. There are some interesting data concerning the sites where portrayals of mammoths were found. S. N. Bibikov (1951) has demonstrated that the portrayal of a "mammoth" from Ozarintsev does not belong to the Palaeolithic period. Z. Abramova.</page><page sequence="73">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. P. P. Efimenko has made note of the fact that the main accumulation of bones at Kostenki I consisted of different skeletal parts - the extremities, scapu- las, pelves, cranial fragments, tusks, etc., repre- senting apparently the remains of several hundred individual mammoths, often including their young. The bones of eighty-six individuals were found at Avdeevo. Fewer bones were discovered at Aleksan- drovka and Anosovka II and Mal'ta, but this may have been because of changes in the local physico- geographical conditions. Representations of Rhinoceros . Figurines of the rhinoceros in miniature and in generalized outline were found at Anosovka II. Some figurines of ani- mals found at Kostenki I may also be placed in this group. They are without heads, but the shape of their bodies resembles that of the rhinoceros more than anything else. There are no analogies to these figurines in Upper Palaeolithic carvings anywhere in the world. The only possible resemblance to them are isolated figurines whose heads were in- tentionally broken off in ancient times. One such figurine from Vogelherd (Germany) has an elongated body and short extremities (Riek 1933, PI. between pp. 170-171, Fig. 3). There are two figurines with- out heads found in the cave of Isturitz, but their species identification is difficult to define. One of them, made of coarse reddish sandstone and rather flat, represents the torso of a straight-backed ani- mal with a rounded rear and two protuberances that portray the front and hind legs. E. Passemard thinks that it might be the torso of a bear (Passemard 1944: 52, PI. XXVI: 6). The second figurine bears a resem- blance to the previous one, but it has no forelegs (Passemard 1944:52, PI. XXVII: 1). The general out- lines of these two figurines are really closest of all to the figurines of animals with the deliberately broken heads from Kostenki I. Some isolated carvings which undoubtedly por- tray the rhinoceros are the heads from Dolni Vesto- nice (Bohmers 1942, Fig. 42:8) and Pavlov (Klima 1957, Fig. 19). A few drawings and engravings are known from Upper Palaeolithic sites in Western Europe. One very expressive drawing of a rhinoceros from the cave of Font-de-Gaume is executed in outline with red paint (Capitán, Breuil and Peyrony 1910:144, Fig. 113). The high fatty withers and short tail closely resemble the details of the Kostenki figu- rines. Another portrayal of a rhinoceros from the cave of La Colombiere which was engraved on a pebble is no less interesting (Mayet and Pissot 1915:126). The massive thickset body with its high withers rests on stout legs and the characteristic short tail dangles down behind it. Portrayals of the rhinoceros are comparatively few in number in the art of the Upper Palaeolithic, and this fully corresponds with the small number of 73 bones of that animal found at the sites of this same period. It is remarkable that the sites in which the most characteristic portrayals of the rhinoceros have been preserved - Dolni Vestonice, Kostenki I, Font- de-Gaume - also did not have its bones among the faunal remains. Any discovery of their bones in other sites is rare: Avdeevo, the bones of four in- dividuals; at Gagarino, of three individuals (thirteen bones in all); at Mezin, two individuals (fifteen bones in all); and from both Aleksandrovka and Pred- most, one individual, etc. From the Siberian sites, only in Mal'ta were the bones of the rhinoceros found, and moreover what is particularly interesting is that they were found in an unusually great quantity, in- cluding skulls. The very few remains of the wooly rhinoceros in the Upper Palaeolithic sites/and the relatively few portrayals of it, would seem to indicate that it was not a constant object of the hunt, or that it gradually died out during the middle of the Upper Palaeolithic. And yet the fact that it was a desirable object of the hunt can be perceived by the engraving on a little stone from the cave of La Colombiere. The artist por- trayed the rhinoceros with a lance piercing its belly. Evidently this had something to do with rituals of hunting magic. The scarcity of the rhinoceros1 re- mains has a possible explanation in that it is very difficult and dangerous to hunt; this fact is borne out by the ethnographic examples taken from life among contemporary African people. On the other hand, if one sees it from a totemistic viewpoint, there may have been a prohibition against eating the meat of a sacred animal. Representations of Cave Lion. Along with the figu- rines portraying easily recognized species of ani- mals - mammoth, bear, and bison - there are also some sculptures of animals both whole and in the form of separate heads, which are of an undetermined species, but undoubtedly of felids. Such sculptures combine the features of both the lion and tiger, and it is most likely that they are reproductions of the cave lion. The bones of the latter are found chiefly, or even exclusively, among the bones of felids of the faunal remains in Upper Palaeolithic sites. In the U.S.S.R., only the heads of this animal have been found at Kostenki I, including a miniature head of a lioness which was reproduced with extra- ordinary realism. The closest analogy to the Kostenki I heads are those from Dolni Vestonice which were made of fired clay (Absolon 1949b: 25, PI. D, E [Russian letters]; Bohmers 1942:30, Fig. 23). Figurines of predators are encountered more often in Western Europe, where they have been dis- covered in the sites of Pavlov, Vogelherd, and Isturitz. Large carvings of a felid, probably the cave lion, have been found in the cave of Montespan (France). Rock portrayals of this animal are few in number, and</page><page sequence="74">74 not always easy to recognize. First and foremost in expressiveness is the famous engraved portrayal of a head and forepart of the body of a cave lion from the Combarelles Cave (Capitán, Breuil and Peyrony 1910:157-158, Fig. 129). The massive lowered head with the characteristic lines of the muzzle, the small ear, the round eyes, and the blunt nose bear a striking resemblance to the head of the lioness from Kostenki I. Very close to this is the portrayal of the head of a carnivore which was carved on a small, flat pebble and found in the cave of Gourdan (Capitán, Breuil and Peyrony 1910:155, Fig. 124). The various portrayals of the cave lion permit one to form a judgment about its exterior appearance. According to a reconstruction proposed by K. K. Flerov and Morozovaia-Ekkert, this animal has more of a resemblance to the tiger than to the lion. The Upper Palaeolithic portrayals show the elongated supple body of the tiger in combination with the massive head of a lion, or sometimes with the more graceful head of a lioness. A mane is occasionally depicted on the neck and a tassel is provided on the tip of the tail. One can make a judgment about the coloring of the hide only through indirect evi- dence. Although it is true that the figurines of car- nivores from Vogelherd had a pattern on them made up of interesting lines and accumulations of dots, they really only served as a reproduction of the fur. The discovery in Mal'ta of a figurine made of mammoth ivory with transverse concentric cuts en- circling the body permitted V. I. Gromov to offer a hypothesis about the exterior appearance of the cave lion. The essential detail on the back side of this figurine appears to be the portrayal of a long dangling tail formed by two parallel cuts along the legs. The design on the figurine and the presence of a tail allows one to state that this may be a de- piction of an animal's hide having the characteristic stripes of the tiger which was thrown over a human being. "Judging by the pattern and also by the size of the hide as compared with the measurements of the human figure, the only possible conclusion is that it is a 'cave lion1 with the typical pattern of the tiger's hide" (Gromov 1935:167). In connection with this is a very interesting carving of a felid from the Neolithic level in the cave of Sha-kuo-tun in Manchuria, discovered by Anders son (Anders son 1923:18-19, PI. VIII: 19). This little carving, schematically executed, is considered by F. Ackerman to be a portrayal of a human being tightly enclosed in a tiger's skin, complete with the head. Such masking is associated by the author with a ritualistic rite pertaining to the tiger (Acker- man 1945:72). According to Andersson, the surface of this figurine has been weathered in places, mak- ing thin longitudinal grooves on it. All of the portrayals mentioned above, in spite of their apparent differences, unquestionably repre- Arctic Anthropology IV-2 sent large felids, primarily one animal possessing the traits of both the lion and the tiger. Researchers who have worked with the skeletal remains of the cave lion are unanimous in noting the fact that its skeleton is a combination of the features of the lion and the tiger. V. I. Gromova has written that three skulls of the cave lion known from Eastern Europe and Siberia combine the traits of the brain case of a tiger with the facial features of the lion. Incidentally, Gromova thinks that the name "cave lion" is an unfortunate misnomer, observing that ". . . in the first place, it is not a lion, and in the second place it has nothing to do with caves since it lived in open country (in contrast to the cave bear and hyena)," (Gromova 193 2:94, footnote 1). In summing up the total research done in the U.S.S.R. on remains of large Quaternary felids, Gromova concludes that "... during the Pleistocene, one species of huge cat, Felis spelaea Goldf . , lived in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia, possessing features of both the lion and tiger in addition to certain specific features of its own; its size did not exceed that of the huge contemporary felids in the northern regions, while in the more southerly regions it varied greatly from that same size to considerably larger" (Gromova 1932:94). N. K. Vereshchagin in his work devoted to the predators of the Binagadinsk locality, after noting on the authority of other investigators, the hybridism of lion and tiger traits of the Quaternary cave lion, cites a number of differences between the skulls of the lion and tiger. Especially interesting for us are two traits which affect the external appearance of this animal: 1) the profile of the tiger's skull is convex in the region of the nasal-frontal sutures, but the lion's is concave; 2) the facial part of the tiger's skull slants upward and back, thereby giving it a "cat-like" look which is unlike the more primitive "dog-like" look of the facial part of the lion's skull. The blending of features of the lion and tiger in the cave lion has prompted Vereshchagin to give a new name to this animal, tigrolev (tigerlion), . . . "since this more closely reflects its morphological pecu- liarities" (Vereshchagin 1951:79-83). The skeletal remains of this huge carnivore are widely distributed throughout Eurasia. Individual bones have been found both in Quaternary faunal re- mains and in fauna of Palaeolithic sites. A summary of individual discoveries of the bones of the cave lion are given in a work by Gromova (1932), but we will not dwell on them here. Tracing the discoveries of the cave lion bones in Upper Palaeolithic sites is of considerably more interest. In Kostenki I, from whence came the por- trayals of the cave lion, relatively large numbers of its bones were found in many of the squares. They consisted mainly of the bones of the paws, both dis- articulated and articulated, and of special interest</page><page sequence="75">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. are those preserved in anatomical order. Also found were the vertebrae of the tail, fragments of the skull, and individual teeth. At Kostenki II, the jaw of a young cave lion was found, while in the upper horizon at Aleksandrovka, forty-nine pieces of bone were recovered which belonged to three individuals - young, middle aged, and old. The majority of the remains were found in a level in the depressions of round dwellings. Large pieces of two skulls were unearthed in the level of the western round dwelling. The upper horizon of the Tel'manskaia site yielded the skull and seven bones belonging to one individual. In Anosovka I (excavated by P. I. Boriskovskii in 1953), two bones were found which, according to Vershchagin's iden- tifications, represented the tarsus and metatarsus of a cave lion. Separate bones of the cave lion have also been found at Kostenki III, the upper horizon of the Kirillovskaia site, and others. The Siberian sites form an interesting picture. The bones of paws and canines of a cave lion were found at Mal'ta, while at Afontova Gora II only one milk molar of this huge felid was found among the remains of numerous other fauna. Only one tooth was discovered at Pereselencheskii Point near Krasnoyarsk. The rest of the Siberian sites do not contain any remains of the cave lion. Thus, despite the wide distribution of their bones, they were still not found in all sites contain- ing abundant faunal remains, and when they were found they were limited both in quantity and selec- tion. Apparently the struggle with these mighty and terrible carnivores presented great difficulties for the primitive hunter. If, by chance, the hunt was successful, its bones may have acquired a special magical significance. In this regard we shall turn our attention to the discovery of the paw bones which were preserved in anatomical position. They had not been abandoned as though useless, thus allowing one to surmise that they had been inten- tionally set aside, as Efimenko has indicated, in special pits in the floor of a dwelling at Kostenki I. Nor was it by accident that the tail vertebrae were found lying in anatomical order. Incidentally, this closely resembles the position of the tail vertebrae of the mammoth from Gagarino. The teeth of the cave lion were found most often, chiefly the canines. Regarding this it would not be amiss to recall the drilled canines from the site of Sordes in France on which were signs in the form of the herringbone design, and a portrayal of felids in a cave at Isturitz on which this same sign appears, apparently representing spears or javelins. And finally, the presence of skulls in nearly all the above-mentioned sites was also not by accident. Evidently the paw bones, tail vertebrae, teeth, and skulls attracted the special attention of primitive man. First of all, the limited selection of the bones 75 indicates that this was not a game animal. However, the selection of the skeletal parts previously referred to, in addition to the hide (the latter of which we were able to make a judgment about because of the figurine from Mal'ta), played some kind of a role in the ideology of primitive man. At any rate, portrayals of the "tigerlion" are comparatively few in number, as we have already discerned. On the whole, the primitive artist de- picted horses, bison, deer, and other animals, since the life and welfare of society depended on the suc- cessful hunt for these. Portrayals of Bear. One of the most popular animals among many contemporary people, as well as those of the remote past, was the bear. The roots of the worship of this animal reach back to the Upper Palaeo- lithic period. One may determine this fact first and foremost by the number of portrayals of the bear dur- ing Palaeolithic times, and although they did not compare in quantity with those of the ungulates, they still outnumbered those of other carnivores to a con- siderable degree. Bear's heads similar to those of Kostenki have been discovered in Dolni Vestonice. They have quite small dimensions and are made of fired clay which was tempered with crushed bone (Absolon 1949b: 25). Heads of the bear have also been found in one Palaeo- lithic site of western Europe, the cave at Isturitz. They are not only the most expressive sculptures among the other animal portrayals of this cave, but among all other Palaeolithic carvings of the bear as well. Their style is close to that of the Neolithic bear's heads made of stone (Passemard 1944:52, PI. XXVI:4; Saint-Perier 1936:132, Fig. 73:2). Apart from separate heads of bears, there are also figurines of this same animal in the art of the Upper Palaeolithic. They were found in the sites of Dolni Vestonice, Pavlov, Isturitz, and Vogelherd. A clay sculpture of a bear was found in the cave of Montespan. Many engravings and drawings are also known from the caves of Combarelles, Teyjat, Las- caux, and others in which the bear is most frequently of all portrayed in profile, as though in motion. This raises the question as to which bear is portrayed in Upper Palaeolithic art, the cave bear or the brown bear? In a number of cases the research- ers have indicated the species without a moment's hesitation, but often there is no foundation behind it. Thus, K. Absolon thinks that the portrayals at Dolni Vestonice represent cave bears and R. de Saint Perier considers the figurines of Isturitz to be representa- tions of the brown bear, mentioning the fact that the latter has a flat forehead while the cave bear has a convex forehead. According to the data of palaeozoology, the cave bear was prevalent during the previous period, that is, during the Lower Palaeolithic, but during the course of the Upper Palaeolithic it gradually died out.</page><page sequence="76">76 The brown bear evolved during the latter period, and in the Magdalenian it was the sole representative of this species in Europe (Lindner 1950:231-233). Therefore, Mindels is correct when he notes that almost all of the known portrayals of the Quaternary bears are those of the brown bear (Windels 1950: 122). The bear, like every other carnivore, did not play as great a role in the economy of primitive so- ciety as did the pachyderms and herbivores, but even so, they were undoubtedly the object of Palaeo- lithic man's hunting. Numerous portrayals of the bear both in carvings, as well as in engravings and paintings indicate the attention that was paid to it during the Upper Palaeolithic. Its skeletal remains in the sites, however, are comparatively few. This fact can possibly be explained on the grounds that in some primitive societies there already existed a taboo against killing the bear since it was a totemis- tic ancestor. At Kostenki I, the bones of the brown bear were well represented just as other carnivores, the wolf and cave lion, but in considerably fewer numbers. The bones of the wolf and cave lion were often found here in anatomical position, but those of the bear were disarticulated and represented different parts of the skeleton - bones of the paw, the teeth, and fragments of the pelvis. More bear bones (from seven individuals) have been encountered at Mezin than in any other site on the Russian plain. In Avdeevo the remains of three individuals were found, in Gontsy and Aleksandrovka, of two individuals, and in Pushkari, the bones of one individual (a canine and one other tooth). No bones were encountered in Gagarino, Tel'manskaia, Kostenki II and III, or Borshevo I. V. I. Gromov specifically mentions the same established fact that there was a co-existence of the bones of both the cave and brown bear in the cave of Sakazhia. The canines of the brown bear had cuts on their roots, but neither the teeth nor other skeletal parts of the cave bear had any traces whatsoever of hu- man workmanship. Therefore, Gromov's observation that the cave bear had lived in that cave up to the time it was occupied by man, who subsequently dis- placed it with his "cooking garbage," is entirely correct (Gromov 1948:265). The only Siberian site in which the bones of a bear were found was Afon- tova Gora II - and these were of the brown bear. In spite of the presence of sculptures of the bear at Dolni Vestonice, none of its skeletal re- mains were found, and this same situation holds true for Isturitz as well. The site of Vogelherd yielded only the bones of the brown bear. The skele- tal remains of the latter are very rarely encountered in any West European site. Thus, the remains of the cave bear were very numerous in the cave of Font de Gaume, while at the same time there were Arctic Anthropology IV-2 only a few belonging to the brown bear. It is very interesting to note that out of the great number of animal portrayals in this cave (for example, eighty of the bison alone) there was only one of the bear. Representations of Wolf. Representations of the wolf are exceptionally rare for Upper Palaeolithic times in spite of the fact that they were undoubtedly a prime object of the hunt as evidenced by the great quantity of their bones in the sites belonging to that period. Only three carved heads of this animal are known in the Palaeolithic art of the U.S.S.R. - one from Kostenki I (made of marl), and the other two are from Anosovka II and are made of bone. A wolf's head made of fired clay has been discovered at the site of Pavlov, Czechoslovakia (unpublished). There are only two carvings of the wolf in the Palaeolithic art of Western Europe, and these are of very doubtful identification. One of these was discovered at the base of the Magdalenian level in the cave of Le Placard in France. It is carved in general outline on the uppermost part of a baton de commandment . The second one was found in the cave of Mas d'Azii (France) in the lower Magdalenian level, and more strongly resembles the head of a fox (Capitán, Breuil and Peyrony 1910:158). Engravings of the wolf are also known from the French sites of Gourdan, Laugerie Basse, Lartet, Espelugues, and Bruniquel (ibid.). A very characteristic engraved wolf s head was discovered in the cave of La Madeleine; it has a wide forehead, pointed ears, and a narrow muzzle (Kühn 1929, Fig. 63). Among the rock paintings, the most expressive is a drawing of a wolf's head in the cave of Combarelles (Capitán, Breuil and Peyrony 1910, Fig. 13 7), and an almost fully preserved figure of a wolf in the cave of Font-de-Gaume (ibid., Fig. 138, PI. XXXVII). The wolf, Canis lupus, is known to have existed in Europe during the lower Quaternary as its remains have been found in the diluvial deposits as well as in Palaeolithic caves. Besides this huge wolf who closely resembles the Canis lupus of present-day Western Europe, there were also a number of smaller species which were probably contemporary with Merck's rhinoceros. The present C. lupus type of wolf appears together with the wooly rhinoceros and is especially characteristic of the Würm glacial stage. The bones of the wolf are widely distributed in the Palaeolithic caves of both Europe and Asia. Boule and de Villeneuve have indicated the presence of the bones of C .* lupus in the Mousterian and Aurignacian levels in the Observatory Cave. In the south, in the caves of Syria, Palestine, and Lebanon, the bones of the wolf, C. lupus , were found in the strata ranging from Mousterian to Neolithic times (Vereshchagin 1951:47). Many wolf skeletal remains have been discovered in the Upper Palaeolithic sites of Central and Eastern</page><page sequence="77">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. Europe. In Kostenki I several dozen bones were found representing pieces of skulls, fragments of jaws, long bones, and canines. They were dis- persed throughout the many squares within the dwelling which was explored by Efimenko. These bones were found to be especially numerous (ap- parently from several individuals), and they were discovered in the fill at the far end of the living area of pit house B. Wolf extremities were also found lying in anatomical order alongside this same pit house, and quite a few were discovered in storage pit VI and food storage pit XIII (Efimenko 1958:332). Isolated bones of the wolf and horse lying among those of other fauna attracted the attention of researchers at Borshevo II. Four wolf mandibles were found lying in pairs and the mandibles of two horses were lying at right angles to each other. Lying fairly close on each side of one wolf skull were two of the extremities of a horse in anatomical order. In the southeastern corner of the excavation were discovered bones of the paw of a wolf in undis- turbed position. The position of these bones in conjunction with the discovery of an arrangement of stones close by has led Boriskovskii to infer that they were linked with totemistic beliefs (Boriskov- skii 1940:283). There are relatively large numbers of wolf bones in the sites: in Mezin the remains of thirteen in- dividuals were found, in Avdeevo twelve, in Aleks- androvka nine, in Gontsy, Pushkari I and Tel'man- skaia, five individuals (in each). Worth noting is the fact that in Tel'manskaia the phalanges (metacarpals and metatarsals, i.e., bones of the paws) were especially numerous among the remains of the wolf, as were the vertebrae. The bones which had been thrown away outside the dwelling consisted of wolf paws which had been chopped off, some still lying in anatomical order. Inside the pit house there were accumulations of various wolf bones. The total absence of the tail vertebrae allows one to assume that the tails had been chopped off and carried away with the hide. Apparently the skulls were special objects of safe keeping (Efimenko and Boriskovskii 1957:203-204). There were no wolf bones at Gagarino, but the re- mains of 103 individuals, including many whole skeletons, were counted at Predmost. In describing the fauna of Kostenki I, Gromov came to the conclusion that neither the wolf nor the fox were really the objects of any deliberate hunt- ing. Evidently these animals stayed in large num- bers near the camps. The imprints of their teeth are seen on some of the bones of the large mammals. The massive finds of wolf bones proves that they were not difficult to hunt, but they were not used entirely as food since their remains were often found lying in anatomical order. According to Gromov, 77 such occurrences indicate that they were used in connection with magical activities. The fact that the entire skulls and parts of skeletons were found in pits or around the dwelling points even more to this probability (Gromov 1937:273). A magical significance is possibly to be seen also in the three metapodia of a wolf which were found at Avdeevo. There are two straight rows of short horizontal cuts along their ridges. On the fourth metapodium is a design made up of little oblique crosses instead of the cuts. The symmetry of these designs proves that they did not arise in the process of work but rather were put there inten- tionally (Gvozdover 1953:219). The cuts seen on the phalanges of a bear or wolf from Eliseevichi have an asymmetrical arrangement ( Polikarpovich 1940b: 286). In Anosovka II, a canine of a wolf was found on one flat side of which were six long, more or less paral- lel cuts plus several shorter ones. In the Upper Palaeolithic of western Europe, many wolf canines have been found with perforations or notches on them for suspension. Portrayals of Birds. It is safe to say without exag- geration that the figurines of birds from Mal'ta do not have a counterpart in Palaeolithic art. They are most carefully and realistically executed in spite of a certain amount of conventionalization in their re- production. Of particular importance is the fact that they are represented as an entire series supplemented by unique figurines. The heads of birds from Kosten- ki I are very distinctive, their contours often being determined by the natural form of the concretions of the marl which served as the raw material. There is a small number of portrayals of birds known in the Palaeolithic art of western Europe. These portrayals, however, differ completely both in style and form from those of Kostenki and Mal'ta. A fragment of a spear thrower from the cave of Mas d'Azii has acquired a wide reputation; on one end there is a fragment of a bird, possibly a wood grouse (Vayson de Pradenne 1934:3-17). There are also a few other portrayals. An indirect likeness can be inferred between the bird heads from Kostenki I and a fragmentary head of a bird from Mas d'Azii {ibid., Fig.. 2). The closest analogy to the engraved portrayal of a bird on the Kirillovskaia tusk can be found in the drawings in the caves of Laugerie Basse and La Croze. The draw- ing on a fragment of a baton de commandment which was discovered in the Magdalenian level in Laugerie Basse represents only the head of a bird with a sharp beak and long neck (ibid., Fig. 8). There are two pebbles, each with an engraved portrayal of a bird's head, which came from the ancient Magdalenian level in the cave of La Croze. One of them is a possible representation of a swan, and has been reproduced very clearly and realistically (ibid., Fig. 17, 18). There are also very unusual portrayals of wading</page><page sequence="78">78 birds from the cave of Labastide (Simonnet 1947:55- 64). The scarcity of bird portrayals during the Upper Palaeolithic can be explained in various ways. However, any attempt to interpret this peculiarity with the explanation that Palaeolithic man did not use them as food, and therefore they had no signifi- cance in his eyes, is groundless. E. Piette had already made note of the bird bones discovered during the course of his excavations, chiefly those of the woodcock and hazel grouse. There was evi- dence that they had been used as food. A. Vayson de Pradenne thinks that he has found one of the plausible explanations. Among primitive people, he says, a man hunted, caught fish, manufactured his tools and weapons, and created works of art. The gathering of plants and shells, and the capture of birds and small animals, fell into the sphere of a woman's responsibilities. Because of this men did not include the image of the bird in their magi- cal activities. It is doubtful, however, if this explanation is correct since it rests on statements that demand proof. Another considerably more important observa- tion by Vayson de Pradenne is that the portrayals were mainly of waterfowl, and this finds its closest analogy in later periods. He notes that the repre- sentations of swans or ducks, waterfowl at any rate, in Europe occur both in the Bronze Age and in the Hallstatt period. There are a great many portrayals of birds, chiefly waterfowl, in Neolithic rock art of southern Spain (Breuil 1925:47-50). The pictographs of the northern U.S.S.R. also show many portrayals of birds (Ravdonikas 1936), and they can be seen on Neolithic vessels (Efimenko 1948), and in the form of miniature flint carvings (Zamiatnin 1948). G. Simonnet criticizes the theory according to which primitive art is supposed to have only an esthetic significance, and that painting was pri- marily a means to break the monotony of the long winter imprisonment. He expresses the thought that in such a case birds, whose outlines are so grace- ful and decorative, would have been unlikely to escape the attention of such excellent observers as the Magdalenians. According to him, the scar- city of bird portrayals in the art of the Upper Palaeo- lithic can be explained first of all by magical con- cepts. Birds escaped easily from the hunter. They were difficult to catch, and because of their size they were not considered as game suitable for hearty nourishment. Apparently the capture of even middle- sized quadrupeds, though less savory, was of greater value. This advances the proposition that the magical activities which were directed toward the reproduction of game and its successful capture did not concern birds. Simonnet finds corroboration for this hypothesis in the fact that the same speci- mens of fauna which were considered dangerous or Arctic Anthropology IV-2 unfit for food were in equal measure absent in Palaeo- lithic art (Simonnet 1947:64). His hypothesis is basically acceptable, but it should be supplemented with other viewpoints concerning birds-. Boriskovskii thinks that the appearance of por- trayals of birds is caused by their economic role in the life of the Palaeolithic hunters. In order to con- firm this idea he cites two discoveries of the bones of birds: a goose and a sea gull in Mal'ta and a polar owl and willow ptarmigan (a small number to be sure) in Mezin. Along with the purely economic role of birds, Boriskovskii acknowledges the rise of a bird cult: "During this stage of the development of primitive people, it is possible that a cult of birds appeared which was closely interwoven with other totemistic cults, including, as did the latter, the cult of female ancestry" (Boriskovskii 1953:282). Efimenko, on the contrary, departs from the cult totemistic viewpoint on the significance of the bird portrayals. He observes: "Neither birds nor fish, apparently, had yet acquired in the period in ques- tion such a significance that they could appear as objects of special attention for the hunter of mam- moth and reindeer. . . Obviously, the appearance of the objects of a primitive cult of such specimens as the portrayals of birds, fish, and snakes (Mal'ta) did not come linked to their economic significance, but rather with a different impetus, originating, no doubt, from some kind of a peculiarity in the ideology of primitive man" (Efimenko 1953:467). In actuality, the skeletal remains of birds found in the sites is greater than one would imagine, but unfortunately, many of them have remained unidenti- fied. It is of interest that goose and sea gull, ac- cording to A. IA. Tugarinov's identification, were found at Mal'ta. The skull of a large bird with part of the cervical vertebrae was found in one of the shallow pits of a dwelling, and had been placed there deliberately. At the bottom of a dwelling which was unearthed in 1956, the skull and wing bones of some kind of a large bird were found near the wall, de- liberately stored there, thinks Gerasimov ( 1958:47), by some ancient men. The separate bones of unidentified birds were found at Kostenki I. Sixteen bones of the ptarmigan (Tundrianaia Kuropatka) belonging to six individuals, and one bone of the polar owl (according to V. I. Bibikov's identification) were found at Mezin. The bones of two individual kestrels plus those of (each) a goose, willow ptarmigan, hen harrier, and sky lark were found at the site of Novgorod-Severskii. Bones of the willow ptarmigan were encountered in large numbers at the Pereselencheskii Point near Kras- noyarsk, while only one bone was found at the settle- ment of Krasnyi IAr on the Angara River. The bones of one individual, a gyrfalcon, were found at Gagarino. The sites of Tel'manskaia (2-3 levels), Gorodtsovskaia, Gontsy, and Telezhnyi Log contained unidentified bird</page><page sequence="79">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. bones. Thus, the following species of birds were known to have existed during the Palaeolithic peri- od in the U.S.S.R.: the goose, sea gull, ptarmigan, willow ptarmigan, polar owl, gyrfalcon, kestrel, hen harrier, and sky lark. Among those species which have been identi- fied in the West European sites, the willow ptarmi- gan stood in first place, and its bones have been found in the caves of La Madeleine, Les Eyzies, Raymonden, and Gourdan (France). An unusual num- ber of their bones have been found in Kesslerloch, Schweizersbild and certain cave sites in Bavaria. The bones of many waterfowl were also found - ducks, geese, and swans. Among the raptorial birds, the bones of the kite prevail. Portrayals of Snakes. Realistic drawings of snakes in the Palaeolithic art of Western Europe are rare. We will discuss only a few of them which to a greater or lesser degree resemble the portrayals of snakes from Mal'ta. It should be pointed out, how- ever, that the exaggeration of the snake heads from Mal'ta has no analogy among the European speci- mens. Attention is attracted first of all by a represen- tation of two snakes on a drilled baton de command- ment from Montgaudie. Their bodies are stretched out and wavy, and their heads, one of which is small and triangular in shape and the other oblit- erated, are turned in opposite directions (Breuil and Saint-Perier 1927:145, Fig. 68:2). Portrayals of snakes on two different objects were discovered in the cave of Gourdan. The upper part of a snake's body terminating in an oval head was traced on a fragment of bone artifact (Piette 1904:149, Fig. 30), and the second engraving, which realistically por- trays a snake of comparatively short length with a heart-shaped head, was drawn on a fragment of a chisel made of deer antler (Breuil and Saint-Perier 1927:146, Fig. 68:4). In the cave of Rideaux (Les- pugue in France), a fragment of a polished bone plate with an opening on it for suspension was found on which was an engraved portrayal of two snakes. Their bodies are short, fairly thick, and have a double bend. Their heads are heart shaped and increased in size. From their general appear- ance, it is possible to define them as portrayals of vipers, the most northern species of snake. It is necessary to note here that this realistic, easily identifiable engraving was found in the upper Aurignacian level together with a large female figurine (Saint-Perier 1924:11, Fig. 4). Carved portrayals of the snake are unknown in Palaeolithic times with the exception of a stylized figurine which was fashioned from the natural curve of a small deer antler found in the cave of Mas d'Azii. One end of the object is rather flat, but the opposite end has an opening in it, and it possibly depicts a snake's head (Piette 1907, PI. XLIII:l,la). 79 To date, not one genuine Palaeolithic wall paint- ing of a snake has been discovered, although it is very probable that the wavy lines on the ceilings and walls of several caves are representations of the snakes' contours. The small clasps from Mal'ta which are marked with a design of a number of wavy parallel lines are possibly stylized representations of a snake's body. Such schematized portrayals are more numerous than realistic representations. They all have one unifying characteristic: the contours of the body are depicted by two wavy parallel lines as, for example, are the ones at Laugerie-Haute (Breuil and Saint-Perier 1927: 148, Fig. 70:7), and at Laugerie-Basse (Lartet and Christy 1875, PI. B, XVIII, Fig. 5: a). A perfect analogy to the snakes portrayed in this manner was discovered on fragments of deer antler in the middle Magdalenian level at the cave of Isturitz (Passemard 1925:135-136). Incidentally, mention should be made at this time of the curious combination occurring in several in- stances of snakes and fishes portrayed together in one drawing. Aside from the realistic portrayals from Montgandier which have already been mentioned, great interest is aroused by the drawings on a per- forated "baton" from the Magdalenian levels (III-IV) at La Madeleine. It depicts two snakes with wavy, wriggling bodies and clearly distinguishable heads on which the eyes have been reproduced by oblong cuts. On the other side of this artifact are two other drawings of snakes, though with highly stylized con- tours. They are accompanied by stylized portrayals of fish in the form of swellings which are joined to- gether and filled in with intersecting lines, as seen in Suponevo and Timonovka, and rhombic net work which closely resembles the design from Eliseevichi. Unidentified Carved Objects. Certain objects of un- certain function might be considered as stylized zoomorphic portrayals. First of all, there are some interesting objects which in form are close to ob- jects from Kostenki I and Avdeevo whose contours resemble the conventionalized portrayals of an ani- mal's muzzle en face. To a certain degree they resemble the tops or figured heads on the long bone spatulas from the sites mentioned above. All these plane surface por- trayals may be thought of as the stylized heads of some kind of felids, bears, and partly also mammoth. Gerasimov (1935:83, Fig. 4) considers the long, slightly curved shaft from Mal'ta, ornamented by rows of crescent-shaped cuts, to be a portrayal of a living creature, possibly a snake. Another explana- tion of this object was offered by A. Salmony (1948: 285-288, Fig. 1, 2) who has devoted an entire article to it. He produces convincing proof that this shaft portrays the fluffy tail of an animal because of its form and the presence of a bulge on it (which serves as a place for the attachment of the object), and, in particular, its design.</page><page sequence="80">80 The crescent design was widely used in Mal'ta. There are three instances in which it was arranged in vertical rows in order to designate the headdress on female figurines. On one of the latter, it covered the form completely from head to foot. We would like to add that this same design can be observed on figurines from Buret1 where it has been used to designate clothing made of an animal's hide. F. Hancar (1939-1940:117) also considers the crescent- shaped cuts as a portrayal of hair. This type of design corresponds with the chevrons which were used to indicate the hairy parts of the body as, for example, on the throat and back of a bison silhou- ette from the cave at Isturitz (Passemard 1925, PL 7, Fig. 9). There are some analogies which confirm the correctness of Salmony's hypothesis. He draws at- tention on behalf of his own supposition with still another piece of indirect evidence when he recalls Arctic Anthropology IV-2 the discovery of a mammoth's caudal vertebra pre- served in anatomical position in a pit in the floor of a dwelling in the Gagarino site. Zamiatnin, be- ing confronted with the facts after observing the portrayal of a tail in a female figurine from Les- pugue, came to the conclusion that it had been used as a conscious and deliberate ornament of the body during magic rituals. This explanation, that the Mal'ta shaft was used as a "substitute" tail of an animal bears witness to the ability of the Palaeo- lithic sculptor to personify a ritualistic object in another material. A second shaft from Mal'ta, preserved incom- pletely, is distinguished from the first one by the details of the design. In the opinion of M. M. Gerasimov, it resembles a stylized portrayal of an animal (Gerasimov 1935, Fig. 27:12). Thus zoomorphic articles on the one hand por- tray stylized heads, and on the other, snakes or tails. 3. CARVED OBJECTS AND ORNAMENTS Those objects whose significance and purpose are regarded by us as uncertain have been cate- gorized as carved objects. By their form and de- gree of craftsmanship they could be ranked as art objects, and even more so since they have no traces of ever having been used. Those objects from Kos- tenki I, Avdeevo, the Irkutsk hospital, Mal'ta, Su- ponevo, and Aleksandrovka are so totally different in outline and detail that naturally they cannot be classified. It is very possible that certain of them had a ceremonial purpose. Classifications can easily be given only for the various ornaments which had a wide distribution in Upper Palaeolithic times. They were made of mammoth ivory, antler, bone, and different kinds of soft stone, and worn either directly on the body or sewn on the clothing. Another group of ornaments consists of objects in their natural state: the dia- physes of small tubular bones, vertebrae of fish, teeth of animals, shells, belemnites, and crystals of calcite with holes or notches on them for suspen- sion. All these ornaments may be divided into the fol- lowing categories: 1) diadems (head or brow bands) - found in Mal'ta, Avdeevo, Kostenki I, Mezin, Suponevo, and Timonovka; 2) bracelets - found in Mal'ta, Mezin, and Suponevo; 3) plaques or clasps - found in large numbers at Mal'ta; 4) disks - found at the Irkutsk hospital site, Buret', the lower horizon at Afontova Gora II, Afontova Gora III, Aleksandrovka, the 7th horizon at Molo- dova V, and Kostenki I; 5) pendants of various types - found in Kostenki I, Aleksandrovka, Anosovka II, Kostenki XVII, Kostenki XIV, Timonovka, Mezin, Pushkari I, Tel'manskaia, Verkholenskaia Gora, Afontova Gora II and III, Sagvardzhile, Gagarino, Avdeevo, and particularly many at Mal'ta; 6) beads, also of various forms and outlines - found in massive quantities at Mal'ta, Buret', Afontova Gora II and III, Eliseevichi, the second layer at Markina Gora, Suponevo, Amvrosievka, Borshevo I, Mezin, Timonovka, and Krasnyi IAr. PURPOSE AND IDEOLOGY OF THE OBJECTS OF PALAEOLITHIC ART When the discovery of the first specimens of Palaeolithic art was made toward the end of the last century, it attracted the attention of numerous re- searchers because of its singularity and vividness. The question then arose among them as to just how one could explain the rapid growth of art at such a remote time. What was it that summoned to life these remarkable portrayals of women and animals, so expressive, so completely realistic? Various hypotheses were suggested in West European literature, each author attempting to ex- plain the significance of these specimens after his own fashion. The female figurines aroused a special interest, not only because of their abundance and wide distribution, which ranged from the Bay of Biscay to Lake Baikal, but also because of their</page><page sequence="81">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. consistency of treatment and their striking general resemblance to one another over this entire vast expanse of Europe and northern Asia. We are not going to dwell here on those theo- ries pertaining to the origin of the figurines, nor even on those conjectures relating to the "steato- pygous" or "steatomatous" character of the por- trayals of women, since it has long been proven that these theories are constructed on shaky premises and do not have a convincing argument. Efimenko is among those critical of such hypotheses (1931c). We will take up, but briefly, only those hypotheses which explain the ideology and significance of these figurines. It is possible to reduce this to two basic theories. The advocates of the first theory see these figurines as a reflection of the esthetic idealism of the people during the Palaeolithic, or as the reflection of erotic motives. In either case, however, they link the female images in Palaeolithic art to a fertility cult. Others regard them as por- trayals of female ancestresses or priestesses who, by virtue of their magical practices, ensured the success of the hunt. An account of the majority of these theories is offered by Saccasyn della Santa (1947:9-21). In Soviet literature these questions are con- sidered in works on the history of primitive art and primitive society. We shall now examine the basic points of view held by Soviet researchers such as archaeologists, ethnographers, and art historians. The discovery of the first female figurine was at Kostenki I and occurred in 1923. In an article devoted to a description of this figurine and to a polemic with Reinach on problems concerning the sources of primitive art, P. P. Efimenko (1926) made only a passing reference to the ideology of this portrayal, saying that it was ". . . of an esthetic, and probably at the same time, a religious and a cult significance." In a subsequent series of arti- cles, and especially in the three editions of his monumental work, "Primitive Society," Efimenko substantiates and developes his views on the sig- nificance and ideology of the Palaeolithic figurines (Efimenko 1931a, 1931v, 1953:396-404). He speaks out resolutely against the attribution of these figu- rines as objects of an erotic nature or as merely products of esthetic or artistic inspiration. While not denying that the figurines by their whole appear- ance reveal an original, primitive esthetic which links the image of beauty first and foremost with conditions of prosperity, contentment and peace, Efimenko goes on to observe that the ideology be- hind these portrayals is impossible to grasp if divorced from the economic conditions and social attitudes of the period from which they arose. The wide distribution of these female figurines, in Efimenko1 s opinion, indicates that they must have played a very vital role in the cosmology of 81 the primitive hunter. They could have been called forth by special reasons of an economic and social order. Efimenko discovered what they were. He established the fact that during the Upper Palaeo- lithic Era there were large settlements occupied over long periods of time, and the fact that they were associated with huge accumulations of mammoth or horse bones would indicate that at this time there already existed a sedentary way of life which soon led up to the recognition of consanguineous relation- ships, thereby placing the woman in the center of everyday life. And it was to the woman that all the responsibilities of this settled way of life fell - the cares of the home, hearth and clothing; she had to prepare the food and a store of provinder for future use. The image of the Female Ancestress as a reflec- tion of the matrilineal structure in the clan organi- zation, as an object of a cult, and as a symbol of the unification of a sedentary hunting group was apparently personified by these numerous female figurines. This image, evidently, was linked to any number of different ideas and, in particular, with magic. "The image of the Female Ancestress as the custodian of the domestic hearth was, according to primitive man's way of thinking, carried over at the same time into the world of reality, that is, into the everyday system of human existence - the image of the mistress and protectress of surrounding nature (for example, as mother and owner of the animals) was able from the very earliest times to be asso- ciated in the mind of the Palaeolithic hunters with this or that animal on whom the existence of the group depended. In this way it is possible that the ideology of primitive settled societies, although ob- viously still rudimentary and interwoven with magic, made its appearance from the very beginning, and everywhere under these same conditions it took the form of esteem of ancestors, the common ancestors of the clan community" (Efimenko 1953:403). In his well known publication about the Gaga- rino site, S. M. Zamiatnin ( 1935:58, 71-77) mentions that it contains a great deal of new data which, along with other discoveries, permits one "... to approach an elucidation of the significance of the entire series of female figurines of the Aurignacian Period." Proceeding from the discovery of female figurines at Gagarino with elongated, slender pro- portions, Zamiatnin considered the feasibility of abandoning the accepted interpretation of these figurines as symbols of fertility and prosperity. If one agrees with those who claim that the disappear- ance of the female figurine in the Magdalenian was caused by a change for the worse in the conditions of life, then, as Zamiatnin believes, one would also have to acknowledge that a radical change took place in the economic system from the Aurignacian to the Magdalenian eras, but in reality according to the</page><page sequence="82">82 facts, this was not so. In opposition to the fertility theory, Zamiatnin advanced his own, the essence of which consists of the fact that these figurines ap- peared as attributes of hunting magic, that is, as the expressers of ideas directed toward the achieve- ment of successful results of the hunt. According to him, the proof of his theory can be seen by the following facts: 1) Female figurines, as the materials from many sites indicate, differ in details of both body structure and decoration, and appeared not so much as the expression of some kind of an ab- stract idea, but as portrayals of real women which, according to G. Kuhn's writings, estab- lishes the concrete character of primitive man's mentality. 2) The presence of tails on certain female figurines indicates their magical significance which is closely related to the essence of these portray- als; this is confirmed by the discovery of the caudal vertebrae of a mammoth preserved in anatomical position on the floor of a dwelling at the Gagarino site; 3) The position of the hand - raised to the face - on Figurine No. 2 from Gagarino finds similar analogies in the gestures of the "masked people" of Magdalenian times, also testifying to magical ritual. And, finally, there is Zamiatnin1 s brilliant com- mentary on the bas-reliefs from the cave of Laussel which is represented by a harmonious composition made up of three women carrying out a magical rite and one man who is supposed to be executing a hunting action - the object of his hunt being a doe - completely confirming the significance of the fe- male portrayals as attributes of magical hunting rituals. The portrayals of antlers and some kind of objects which resemble vessels in the hands of the women are also possibly connected with magic activities. Zamiatnin has undoubtedly given a penetrating interpretation of the Laussel bas-reliefs. It is the same with many other facts noted by him, such as the existence of female figurines in series, and the presence in those same sites of portrayals of ani- mals and 'sometimes of men - all testifying to the fact that hunting magic developed during the Upper Palaeolithic. This same circle of ideas connected with magi- cal activities directed toward the successful out- come of the hunt was, according to Zamiatnin, carried over into Magdalenian times, though in a more developed form, but the human portrayals at the beginning of the Upper Palaeolithic differed only formally from the "masked people" of Magda- lenian times. A work on the evolution of magical ideas dur- ing the Palaeolithic was prepared for the press in Arctic Anthropology IV-2 1935 by Zamiatnin, but, regrettably, it was not pub- lished. A. S. Gushin dwells at length on the portrayals of women in the Palaeolithic period in his book, The Origin of Art. He acknowledges the magical sig- nificance behind Upper Palaeolithic art, and he places the carved portrayals of women in close re- lationship with the general productive, magical trend. Zamiatnin1 s hypothesis concerning the magical sig- nificance of the female figurines in the preparation of the hunting process is given full support by Gushin who considered it possible to supplement it and by this means to "... arrive at the much more interest- ing question about the role of the woman in the magical ideas of both Palaeolithic and contemporary hunters, and also toward the elucidation of the highly specialized meaning which was apparently attached to the women in the magical guarantee of the results of the hunt" (Gushin 1937:107). Here, for the first time in Russian literature, Gushin raises the question about the close relation- ship between women and animals, but regretfully did not develop it. In a number of his works, A. P. Okladnikov also directs his attention toward an explanation of the female figurines. He distinguishes three aspects of the Palaeolithic female image. In connection with the special role of women in early matriarchal so- ciety there emerged "... notions about super-human beings of the female sex, sovereign mistresses op- erating within a definite sphere of natural phenomena, or sovereign mistresses of definite activities" (Oklad- nikov 1955a:44-48). Okladnikov thinks that the ideas connected with the Palaeolithic figurines of women may possibly be similar to the female spirit guardians of the Arctic Eskimos who are one of the most primi- tive tribes in their level of development, and whose socio-economic structure approximates that of the ancient tribes of Siberia and eastern Europe. Among the Eskimos these spirits are closely re- lated to the hunt and to hunting magic, exerting their influence over both sea and land animals. In Oklad- nikov1 s opinion, this same notion may have existed among the Palaeolithic hunters. Further peculiar aspects of these notions about the connection be- tween women and animals appear in the writings of Gushin. In Okladnikov1 s words, they find expression "... in a widespread ancient hunting myth about Woman - guardian of animals and owner of the forest with whom the male hunter enters into a relation- ship, receiving as his reward success in the chase. This myth can also explain the characteristic com- bination of the three forms - the woman, the hunter, and the animal - in Palaeolithic art (at Teyjat and Laussel, for instance) which has already been men- tioned by Zamiatnin" (Okladnikov 1957:19-20). At the same time, all this does not preclude the</page><page sequence="83">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. fact that the Palaeolithic female figurines could have had another significance. On the basis of a resemblance of these figurines to the much later portrayals of female spirits and mother-goddesses who are the protectresses of child bearing, Oklad- nikov believes that the Palaeolithic portrayals de- picted female spirits who were the guardians of fertility. This point of view is confirmed by ethno- graphic examples, for instance, the goddess, Aiysyt, of the Yakuts, and the emegenderi of the Altáis. In the consideration of the problem about the origin of the Palaeolithic portrayals, Okladnikov arrived at the conclusion that they might also have had something to do with the cult of death. Similar to Kyys-Tangara of the Yakuts, they could have been made in the event of the death of a member of the family, a girl or woman. The cult worship of these receptacles of souls was, in all probability, not only confined to anxieties in these matters alone, but it was also expressed in rituals of a different kind related to the desire to increase the number of the members of the clan, to raise the birth rate in it, and to the necessity for ensuring the success of the hunt, to increase the quantity of game, and to augment the numbers of wild game, seemingly those which were the immediate objects of their hunting necessities" (Okladnikov 1955a:48). In addition to the archaeologists, ethnographers also brought up questions in our literature about the significance and character of the female figurines, notable among them being V. G. Bogoraz (1936), S. V. Ivanov (1948 et al.), and A. S. Anisimov (1949 et al.). The materials gathered by them have been a help toward the full understanding of the ideology of female figurines of the Palaeolithic. The opin- ions of D. K. Zelenin should be noted separately. He sees the Palaeolithic figurines as receptacles for the spirits of sickness: "The misshapen, fat figures of the Palaeolithic figurines portray preg- nant women, but they also sometimes portray women sick with dropsy, with swellings on various parts of their bodies, etc. On the other hand, the extremely thin figures portray women ill with tuberculosis and exhaustion" (Zelenin 1936:262). In the light of new data, Zelenin1 s hypothesis does not hold up, and his arguments are not at all convincing. An original theory was put forth not long ago by D. E. Khaitun (1955:129-142). It is based specifi- cally on the position taken by Efimenko, according to whom the female figurines were portrayals of female ancestresses. Khaitun thinks that these clan ancestresses were at the same time totemic ancestresses, well known to us through Australian myths. He ascribes to the Aurignacian figurines that very same meaning which has been attributed to the various anthropomorphic "masked figures" of the Magdalenian. Khaitun1 s theory is based prin- cipally on the totally accidental resemblance be- 83 tween Efimenko1 s description of the Willendorf figu- rine and the descriptions of the totemic ancestresses found in the Australian myths, and for this reason we cannot accept it. After considering all that has been done in the field of the interpretation of the female figurines, we have been able to arrive at the following conclu- sions. The image of the Woman-Mother embodied in the figurines of the Palaeolithic was a complex one, and it included diverse ideas related to the special sig- nificance of the woman in early clan society. "Mother - the basic idea behind the matrilineal clan society. She was neither a god, an idol, nor the mother of a god; she was the 'Clan-Mother,1 to be understood only as something totally and concretely material" (Petrov 1934:156). This formulation clearly shows the indissoluble relationship between the woman and the clan. The ideology of the hunting tribes in this period of the matriarchal clan was reflected in the female figurines. By taking the ethnographic data into account, it is possible to contend that there are two different aspects of the woman's image during the Palaeolithic which do not contradict, but rather complement, one another. On the one hand, her image stands out as the mistress of the home and hearth, protectress of the domestic fire, and as the one who was respon- sible for the well being of the household and the bearing of children. On the other hand, her image manifested notions of the woman as the owner of the elements of nature, and as the sovereign mistress of animals and especially of game animals, those spe- cies on whom the life and well being of society de- pended. In either case without a doubt, there is a connection between the woman and ideas concerning fertility. Firstly, the hearth and home are linked with the image of the original mother. Secondly, we may suppose that the decisive role taken by the woman in the magical rituals preceding the chase had a special significance for its success in the eyes of primitive man. Thus there is essentially no contradiction be- tween the two principal theories - the theory of fertility and the theory of magic - both of which have been accepted by Soviet scholars in the light of Marxist-Leninist ideology. It is completely ob- vious that the Palaeolithic figurines reflected the esthetic views of those times, and they were linked to an esthetic origin. The working out of a method for the investiga- tion of Palaeolithic habitations by Soviet scholars has made it possible to argue and substantiate the general position taken by us in the above statements. The excavations of Palaeolithic settlements has es- tablished the characteristic position of the female figurines inside the dwelling hollow and most fre- quently of all in special storage pits dug into the</page><page sequence="84">84 floor. In a number of cases they had been carefully covered over by the bones of animals or by stone slabs as though to deliberately hide them from the eyes of strangers. The fact that the storage pits containing the figurines were located quite near the hearth is especially worth noting. Much ethnographic information, the sources of which lead to the epoch of the matriarchal clan, have made it possible to fully ascertain the exist- ence of ideas in Palaeolithic times concerning the close tie between the woman - as mistress of the home and clan ancestress - and the domestic hearth and dwelling. According to the opinions of many northern Asiatic peoples, most distinctly expressed by the Tungus, the spirit of the hearth has the form of a clever old, but still strong and vigorous, woman, a portrayal of which is still stored in each tent. The idea of the female clan ancestress is still pre- served among many people in the form of a portrayal of their spirit ancestresses. The latter are often reproduced as dolls or "wooden balvanchiki"* in which they believe the soul of the dead woman re- sides. The carvings of the Aleuts and Eskimos studied by S. V. Ivanov are very significant in this respect. An important meaning is attached to the Altai emegenderi, the dolls sewn from pieces of cloth, the chief function of which is to guard women in childbirth and to promote the successful outcome of the delivery. Their function also includes the guarding and defense of children in addition to the home, the hearth and possessions. Similar concepts are linked with the Goldi's djhuolin, the Negidal's masi, and with certain Buryat and Nenets (Samoyed) ongon. The existence of a female ancestor cult in present times has been recorded on the island of Palau in Micronesia. A number of cults connected with female mythological images are known in Australia. N. N. Kharuzin notes that many peoples living under a patrilineal kinship system consider themselves as really having de- scended from a female ancestor, and so he justifi- ably regards this as a survival of the matriarchal clan. Those images which have been preserved from the period of the matriarchal clan are combined with a series of common features - the Goddess- Pra-Mother - firmly bound to the domestic hearth and influencing the prosperity of the clan, the fer- tility of women, and the safety of children. At the same time such female deities were spirit ancestors, protectresses of the family and clan. The Fire Mother, the Ancestor Clan Mother, influenced not There is no single word equivalent for the Russian balvanchik (singular). It refers to a block or stout shaft of wood with little or no "shaping out" on it - formless, in a sense. - Trans. Arctic Anthropology IV-2 only the well-being of the clan, according to the Goldi, but the fecundity of young women as well. The essential nature of this concept is close to the belief that Yakuts hold about Aiysyt, their goddess of fertility, who is also linked with the hearth. This same idea applies to the spirit, Umai, of the Turkic tribes of the Altai. These deities, according to the beliefs of the Siberian tribes, guarantee the fertility of women and protect the children. Close to these are the goddesses, Sarakka of the Lapps, "Earth Mother" of the Nenets (Samoyeds), Kal'tas of the Ostyak, IUrt-ava and Norov-ava of the Mordvins, Tusholi of the Ingush, and in addition, the deities of the Eskimos - Sedna, Asiak, Khila, and others. Thus, through the use of ethnographic material we are able to observe a definite evolution of ideas. In the first stage there were collective spirits and images of real living Woman-Mothers. As time went on their characteristic traits were preserved, but they developed into female deities, that is, into the image of a mother-goddess, and this image in turn passes into the religions of the ancient world and up to our time, including Christianity. Our Upper Palaeolithic portrayals of women belong to the initial stage of this evolution. As has already been noted, the image of the Woman-Mother, protectress and spirit-ancestress of the home, was also combined with other notions, with her role in the basic economy and source of the life of ancient man, namely, the hunt. Female deities were often described by earlier writers as goddesses of mountains and of wild ani- mals (Cybele, Rhea, Parvati, and others). The Yakuts' Kubiai-khotun, the Eskimo's Sedna, the "wooden woman" of the Reindeer Chukchi, Luot-khozik of the Lapps, Dal of the Svan - all these mythical female beings were patronesses of the hunt, deliverers of prey and success in the chase. In addition, these same real women held a mys- terious power which, in the minds of primitive people, was able to influence the multiplication of game ani- male as well as luck in the hunt. Time and again, hunting rites are described in ethnographic literature in which women take an active part. The women, ac- cording to their beliefs, are able to bring animals to the hands of the hunters. In view of this, a special significance is to be had in the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palaeolithic figurines portrayed women in the nude. Here, obviously, heightened sexuality did not play a role with primitive artists as some writers have indicated, nor were the women compelled to take off their clothing because of the intense heat of the dwellings, as contemporary Arctic people are forced to do. The most correct assumption is that in primi- tive magic, as shown by many ethnographic examples, nudity was regarded as having a special supernatural meaning.</page><page sequence="85">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U .S .S .R. 85 In the eyes of primitive man, hair also may have had a similar significance. According to primitive beliefs, hair embodies the life force of a man, and for this reason it plays such an important role in marriage ceremonies, and when cut it served as a sign of mourning among many peoples. It is an out- standing fact that the heads of the Palaeolithic fig- urines, with the exception of the face, were usually accorded great attention. They were often decorated with complex designs in which one can perceive the skillfully executed, intricate headdress. On certain figurines, loose flowing hair was depicted. It seems quite evident that the portrayal of hair on a figurine must have raised its magical power. In addition to the portrayals of women, as we have already mentioned, another basic subject of Palaeolithic art also consisted of animals which were especially numerous in the West. This fully corresponds with the fact that hunting was the pri- mary source of existence in the life of primitive man. Insofar as the hunt was not systematic, but rather more of a fortuitous affair, the well-being of society was completely dependent on its success or failure. The abundance of game, which one is likely to infer from the enormous quantities of faunal remains at the sites, does not, in reality, testify to a full ma- terial prosperity, since it is difficult to establish the length of time it took to accumulate these re- mains. An animal had to be obtained, and here the hunter not only relied on his own strength and the efficacy of his weapons, but also on the active in- tervention of outside agencies as well. We are not able, naturally, to fully comprehend the hunting "psychology" of Palaeolithic man, but we are able to grasp it to some degree, possibly on the basis of ethnographic information. Contemporary primitive people attach an enormous significance to the magi- cal ritual which the hunter has to take part in be- fore departing for the chase, its purpose being to pacify the animal and persuade it not to be angry because it was about to be killed. Aside from the hunt, there were other apsects of life that appeared mysterious and enigmatic to the undevoped mind, and these must also have evoked the need for magi- cal rituals in which a great role could have been played by creatures having no significance for the economy of primitive man. F. Engels has written that the various ideologi- cal fields - religion, philosophy, and so on - con- tain much prehistoric content which nowadays seems senseless to us. At the base of these various er- roneous notions lay the inferior economic develop- ment of the prehistoric period. "Nevertheless, even though economic necessity was the main impetus which pressed the cognition of nature onward - and in the course of time it became an even greater impetus - it still would be pedantic to search for an economic reason behind all these primitive inanities. The history of science is the history of the gradual removal of this nonsense, or the substi- tution of it with new, but less absurd nonsense. "* The ideas which have been ascribed to the por- trayals of animals among the Palaeolithic hunters can be elucidated by ethnographic data picturing the psychology and beliefs that have been carried down to our time by contemporary primitive hunting tribes in the form of vestigial ideologies. These ideas have undoubtedly passed through a prolonged course of development. In the beginning, man did not differentiate himself from the animal world, im- plying human traits to these creatures, and attributing to them the ability to think, speak, and even to enter into marriage with human beings. Moreover, man recognized characteristics and qualities in animals that far surpassed those of humans. He looked upon the animal as not only his equal, but to some degree as a higher, much stronger creature, endowed with a special intellect, cunning, and an acute sense of smell. One of the outstanding Russian ethnographers, L. IA. Shternberg, wrote "The strength of the large animals, the cunning and resourcefulness of even the small creatures such as the sable, the uncanny sense of smell and a host of other instincts that are inherent in the animal but absent in the human being, and, further, such phenomena as the shedding and change of color of the fur, and so on - all this gave the Gilyak sufficient grounds to regard every animal as extremely intelligent and in many respects superior to themselves. The smaller the animal, the stranger the form, the greater the mystery that surrounds it and the more astonishment it arouses by its marvel- ous instincts. For this reason even the insignificant living creatures, such as the toad, lizard, bat, mos- quito, etc. arouse in the Gilyak1 s mind no less fan- tastic notions and impresses him no less than do the largest animals" (Shternberg 1936:32). This example does not apply just to the Gilyaks, but we have quoted it because its brilliance confirms the thoughts of Engels on the origin of ideas of a sacrosanct nature, that is, the first religious con- cepts: "It is intriguing as to just how ideas of a sacrosanct nature arose among so-called primitive peoples. Sacrosanct is that which we originally adopted from the animal world . . . the Animal Ele- ment."*" Insofar as the chase was the mainstay of life for primitive society, the hunters gave it all their strength and powers of concentration. A great deal *F. Engels. Letter to K. Schmidt, October 2 7, 1890. Taken from the book, Karl Marx and Fried- rich Engels, Selected Works, Vol. XXVIII: 255. **F. Engels. Letter to K. Marx, December 8, 1882. Taken from the book, Karl Marx and Fried- rich Engels, Selected Works , Vol. XXIV:598</page><page sequence="86">86 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 of attention has been devoted to this question in Shtemberg's works, which are based not only on his own observations, but also on the evidence of such thoughtful discerning researchers as David Living- ston, Karl von den Steinen and others. We will now pose another problem: What was the original motivating force that summoned these Palaeolithic figurines into being? On the basis of archaeological data, we can assert that there existed simultaneously with the Woman -Mother cult of the Upper Palaeolithic another (and probably the most ancient) cult - the cult of animals, not figuratively, but in the literal sense of the word. Portrayals of animals came into being as the result of the esteem and worship accorded to them. During the first span of his existence man was weak and without protection, while the animals were well armed both for attack and defence. As time went on, man perfected tools for labor and hunting, but at the same time he did not lose his fear and worship for either the might and wisdom or the strength and cunning of these creatures, and the cult of animals which had been developing acquired new forms. During this stage of development while man was creating his amazing art of primitive realism, the cult of animals undoubtedly carried within itself some totemic concepts, the essence of which con- sisted of ideas about animal ancestors. The uni- versality of these notions and their presence among the very primitive tribes of today enables us to con- sider totemism as the elementary form of religion, and in general, as having been the religion of the emerging clan society. There is a great possibility that the elements of such ideas had actually already emerged in the Palaeolithic at which time they were concerned with the identification of man with animal and of the transferal of the relationships peculiar to human society over into the world of animals. Ma- terial evidence of these ideas can be found in a number of sites, for example, in Kostenki I, Dolni Vestonice, La Ferrassie, etc., and it consists of portrayals which possess half zoomorphic, half anthropomorphic features. In regard to this, it is impossible to follow N. N. Kharuzin, who, under the influence of E. Tylor, thought that the cult of animals sprang from totemism. Shternberg, though, is perfectly correct when he wrote that "... for a true understanding of the gene- sis of totemism, it is necessary to bear in mind the following: 1) Clan organization, terotheism, the cult of nature, and in equal measure, the special clan cult, existed before totemism. . ." (Shternberg 1936:202). In reference to one of the traits just mentioned by Shternberg, it should be mentioned that terotheism, in other words, the cult of animals, arose earlier than totemism. This is completely in order and cannot be otherwise. Judging by the ethnographic data, it can be said that, in general, the portrayals of animals had as their object an extremely important function for Palae- olithic society - they exerted an influence over the animals, converted them into the prey of man, made them become amenable, and induced them not to bring misfortune to man, etc. A successful hunt was de- pendent on the animal, and therefore it was linked with the prosperity of society - it was a beneficent being. In addition to this, however, the animal often played another role - menacing and harmful - an enemy rather than a friend to man. Complicated rituals involving hunting magic arose and were developed on the basis of these views, the reflection of which can be seen in the numerous relics of Palaeolithic art: in the depths of the caves of France and Spain were found clay sculptures of the cave lion, bear (Montespan), and bison (Tue d'Au- doubert), plus engraved and painted portrayals of the bear(Trois Freres), rhinoceros (Colombier), bison and horse (Niaux), a sculptured lioness, and the drawing of a bison (Isturitz) - all of these showed deliberately inflicted wounds or depicted the animal as being struck by a weapon. There are also objects from central and eastern Europe: the head of a lioness and other animals with magic signs on them were found at Dolni Vestonice, plus fragments of animal figurines from Kostenki. The magical subjects of Palaeolithic art reflect a desire not only to kill animals, and gain mastery over them, but there is also another aspect to primi- tive magic, and this was the idea of fertility. This idea was inseparably linked with the cult of animals and the cult of the Woman-Mother which passes over into concepts of the zoomorphic totemic ancestor (drawings of these in the caves of La Madeleine, Mas d'Azii, Pechialet, and others). The cult of animals was not only concerned with their killing, but with their resurrection as well, a fact which can be found in ethnographic data dealing with rites of propitiation and expiation. It is interesting to note that the larger share of carvings of animals do not represent the whole figure, only the head, but they are realistically executed, the eyes and ears being especially well reproduced. One can almost hypothesize that the person who was portraying them deliberately emphasized their amazing ability to see and to hear, and for this reason tried to bring these qualities to life in the portrayal. It should be remembered that the faces on the female figurines were very rarely filled in, only two or three cases having eyes, while none at all had ears, but on the other hand, the sex characteristics of the Woman- Mother were accentuated on every figurine. Very often the worship of the animal was not only transferred to an image, but to the different parts of its body as well, which in the eyes of primitive man signified a particular strength: the canines and other</page><page sequence="87">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 87 teeth, the claws, and various bones such as the phalanges, metapodia, etc. The canines of animals were one of the most widespread types of ornamen- tation both in the Upper Palaeolithic and in later times, and they were used not so much as a decora- tion as they were in the sense of an amulet or talisman. It will be recalled that besides this there were discoveries of the caudal vertebrae of a mammoth from Gagarino and a cave lion from Kostenki I - all preserved in anatomical position. There were also the discoveries of the paw bones of both a cave lion and a bear from Kostenki I, the metapodia of a wolf bearing cuts from both Avdeevo and Eliseevichi, and skulls from many sites which apparently had been deliberately saved. The development of the ancient cult of animals undoubtedly passed through a long and intricate course. The presence of portrayals of various species of fauna in the Palaeolithic sites indicates that at this time there was still no preference for one particular kind- of animal, nor was there as yet differentiated an animal that had clearly taken shape as the totem. It is interesting to note on the one hand that there already existed a definite standardi- zation in the portrayals of some kinds of animals, for instance, the figurines of mammoths (Kostenki I, Anosovka II) and birds (Mal'ta). This is in contrast to the portrayals of other animals which were de- picted in a different manner, often in the form of separate distinctive heads. If one regards the Palaeolithic portrayals as material evidence of the development of a cult of animals, then it will be possible to recognize the truth in the thoughts of V. G. Bogoraz and B. L. Bogaevskii on the plurality of revered animals in Palaeolithic times and the preferential esteem for some one species of animal which characterized the following periods. Indeed, Bogaevskii uses the term "multi-fauna" or "pantherion" to designate the situation in the depths of the Franco-Cantabrian caves where on the walls in disorderly profusion were placed various portrayals of Palaeolithic ani- mals (Bogaevskii 1934:51). A. Begouen calls such locations "the place of the magical meeting of the animals." It is possible to extend the concept "pantherion" to mean a cult of all or some of the animals which in the eyes of primitive man of a given locality had a special significance. Thus, portrayals of the horse, bison, and reindeer were almost completely absent at the sites on the East European plains while at the same time they pre- dominated over the portrayals of other animals in the cave art of the West. In certain caves, Mas d'Azii and Isturitz, for example, the overwhelming majority of carvings consisted of horses. The dis- covery of a half length figurine of a woman which had been carved on the root of a horse's tooth is of unusual interest; it was found at Mas d'Azii. In sites of the European part of the U.S.S.R., the mam- moth played the predominant role over other por- trayals of animals, and the latter, as well as the mammoths, were made in series. In conclusion we will pause on yet one other problem. We have already taken note of the signifi- cance of the woman in the magical rituals which preceded the hunt. There is a great deal of material which establishes the fact that in the eyes of primi- tive man the woman was directly united with the animal as a being having a definite influence over it, and entering into a magical bond with it so as to guarantee the success of the hunt. Okladnikov wrote: "The animal and woman, according to the laws of primitive logic, entered into a partnership with each other, the motif of the hunt being interwoven with the theme of love" (Okladnikov 1950a:324). A great amount of ethnographic data attests to the bond be- tween the animal and woman, the result of which caused the emergence of the clan which had its own totem ancestor of a particular animal. As Bogoraz has observed, the totemic union with animals was always entered into through the woman and it was precisely from this union of the woman and male ani- mal that a half-human, half-animal child was born (Bogoraz-Tan 1936:32-33). From the archaeological data it is evident that the clan was not linked with any one definite totem animal during Upper Palaeo- lithic times, even though totemic ideas had already appeared. The clan determined its blood kinship ties only through the woman, and with the develop- ment of the cult of animals it began to recognize the latter as totemic ancestors. However, further re- search alone will be able to present the meaning and purpose of Palaeolithic art with sufficient conclusive- ness and reliability. CONCLUSION The Palaeolithic art within the territory of the U.S.S.R. occupies a very important place in the his- tory of the oldest art of all mankind. The collec- tion of Palaeolithic art in the U.S.S.R. is so abundant and is increasing quantitatively with such rapidity that one is enabled to draw a number of general de- ductions and conclusions on the basis of the exist- ing specimens. 1) The rich and complex history of the tribes of that era who inhabited the territory that is now the Soviet Union found its specific, and at the same time, clear expression in their art. Aside from the</page><page sequence="88">88 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 fact that it reflects the cultural and spiritual life of these Ice Age people, it also furnishes an important source for the study of the interrelations between these ancient inhabitants of the various regions of Europe and Asia. In conformity with the generally accepted existence of three major local cultures during Upper Palaeolithic times, the art of the U.S.S.R. can be divided similarily into three large regional variants - the East European, the Black Sea region, and the East Siberian. The art sites from the Black Sea region, the caves of the Crimea and Caucausus, are meagre and not too expressive. The Mgvimevi caves of this region, however, contain the only rock engravings in the entire U.S.S.R. Zamiatnin has made note of the fact that they closely resemble the engravings of the cave of Romanelli and others in the Mediter- ranean area. The sites of Siberia are another striking ex- ample of local originality. The East Siberian sites of Mal'ta and Buret1 are rich in art objects which, in spite of the traits they have in common with East and West European specimens, still possess their own specific individuality. Thus, it is only among the Siberian figurines that portrayals of clothed women exist, that is, figurines which are entirely covered with a design consisting of transverse lines or regular rows of crescent-shaped cuts that were intended to designate fur apparel. The tri- nominal division is characteristic of the Siberian figurines. The head by volume is often equal to the torso and the legs taper off to a cone at the apex of which is a hole. There is no precisely similar analogy in the Palaeolithic art of the U.S.S.R. for the portrayals of birds or the engravings of snakes from Mal'ta. The spiral design made up of round depressions also represents the specific individual- ity of Siberian art. In addition, the only known an- cient rock portrayals in the U.S.S.R., which Oklad- nikov has placed as belonging to Palaeolithic times, were found in the Siberian region. * The most numerous and diversified Palaeolithic art objects in the U.S.S.R. come from the sites in the East European region, chiefly from those areas around the middle course of the Don and Desna rivers. A' specific individuality is also revealed'by the art here. As a rule the female figurines of East- ern Europe have regular proportions and their gen- eral appearance is most realistic. The portrayals of animals which are nearly always made of marl represent, on the whole, a distinctive phenomenon. The geometric decoration of the sites of this region Written before the discovery of Kapova Cave in the Urals. - Ed. finds no analogy in the Palaeolithic art of either Asia or Europe in its degree of development (e.g., mean- der of Mezin). A number of sites along the Don and Desna were formerly considered to cover a great span of time, but the study of Palaeolithic art in these sites allows one to confirm the theory that they be- long to one period within the Valdai glaciation. The differences, then, between these two large groups of sites are not chronological (Aurignacian, Solutrean, Magdalenian), but local: realistic carvings predomi- nate at the Don sites, while geometric design prevails at the sites in the Desna River area. In a correspond- ing manner, the specialized flint tool inventory from these two areas is not a chronological indicator, but rather it depends on the material being fabricated and the type of portrayal (bone or marl, carving or engraving). At the same time all these differences existed against a background of the striking general uniformity of Palaeolithic man's art and culture over the entire East European territory. Leaving aside the other elements of cultural de- velopment, the Don and Desna sites have much in common in terms of carving and decoration with those of Central Europe such as Dolni Vestonice, Pavlov, and Predmost. Further to the west, this similarity extends through Willendorf, Vogelherd, Linzenberg, and Grimaldi over to the sites of Brassempouy, Les- pugue, Laussel, Isturitz, and other sites in the Franco- Cantabrian region. The objects from the Siberian region (Mal'ta and Buret1 ) have many traits in common not only with the East European specimens, but with those of Western and Central European Palaeolithic sites also. The image of the woman is common to all this immense territory from the Pyrenees to Lake Baikal and it is possible to see common features along with features of originality in this image in all these local groups - the East Siberian, East European, Central European, and West European. At the present level of understanding it is impossible to explain the re- semblance of the many details. For example, the figurine from Mal'ta with an Italian figurine from Cocce di Scandiano or a Buret1 figurine with "La Fillette" of Brassempouy. Scholars have repeatedly made observations about the similarities between some of the East European and West European figu- rines, for example, the Gagarino figurines with figurines of Willendorf or Grimaldi, or the figurines of Eliseevichi with the figurine from Laugerie Basse, and so on. These resemblances, nevertheless, do not prove that a complete identity exists between the female figurines, not even those from sites that are territorially close to each other such as Gagarino and Kostenki I. The figurines from Central Europe, specifically those from Dolni Vestonice and Pavlov, are notice- ably stylized although some of them, for example,</page><page sequence="89">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 89 the figurine from Petrkovice, possess a uniquely graceful outline. While the female figurines of the various re- gions bear a certain common likeness to one another, the faunal portrayals, on the other hand, display regional differences. It is of interest to trace the distribution of subjects. Thus, the engraving of a mammoth from Mal'ta does not have an analogy in either the eastern or central European regions, but at the same time it has a close resemblance to the engraving from La Madeleine and other mammoth portrayals from Western Europe. In exactly the same way, neither the carved portrayals of birds nor the engravings of snakes from Mal'ta find an analogy in our own U.S.S.R. Carvings of birds in the Palaeolithic art of Western Europe are not too expressive and fall far behind the Mal'ta series. Engraved portrayals of snakes, however, are quite numerous in the West, but there is nothing similar to the swollen heads of the Mal'ta snakes. In this case it is possible to speak only of a formal simi- larity. The figurines and separate heads of animals from the Palaeolithic of the East European region are also quite distinctive. The figurines from Dolni Vestonice and Pavlov are quite similar to these, while those of Vogelherd and Isturitz are to a lesser degree. The mammoth figurine from Avdeevo is ap- parently the only one that is close to the Predmost figurine. Comparatively speaking, figurines and heads of animals from the West European region are a rare occurrence, with the possible exception of portrayals of the horse, and to some degree, of the bison. By means of painting, bas-relief, and engravings on the walls of caves, slabs of stone, and fragments of bone and antler, ideas linked with the animal world were expressed. The multiplicity and wide variety of the figu- rines of fauna from the U.S.S.R. evidently attests to the same "pantherion" which Bogaevskii estab- lished for the Palaeolithic cave sanctuaries in Western Europe. The carved articles and ornaments from the Palaeolithic sites in the U.S.S.R. are at least on a par with, and in many cases excel, those of the West European sites, and are evidence of the ad- vanced development of esthetic concepts. Special interest is aroused by the presence of various disks and circles in all local regions of Upper Palaeo- lithic art including the little known East Asiatic region. They had centrally located openings and in some instances radiáis extended out from the center. Apparently these were the earliest portrayal of the sun which was evoked by similar concepts among all the inhabitants of Europe and Siberia in the Palaeolithic. The reason for the obvious community of culture of Palaeolithic man did not consist merely in the uniformity of his way of life and economy which by convergence evoked identical concepts and art. We must suppose that all sorts of migrations took place over the vast expanses of Europe and Northern Asia, the various tribes thus coming into contact with one another. There is also the possibility that these Palaeolithic tribes, which left behind such a startling and vivid art in Western and Eastern Europe and Si- beria, were linked by a common origin. 2) Palaeolithic carving is of exceptional value in the study of the mode of life during that era. It is able to reveal the existence of warm tailored fur clothing plus other details in the form of girdles, shoulder belts, back packs (nazadnik), and head- dresses. In addition to the elements of clothing which were portrayed on the figurines, the remains of real ornaments have been preserved down to our time in the Palaeolithic sites, and, what is more im- portant, in burials where they were found lying in an undisturbed state. For the ornaments of clothing or body, man utilized various materials or objects, any- thing that attracted his attention or had a special significance in his eyes. The ornaments which they had consisted of head bands or diadems, bracelets, plaques, clasps, pectorals, numerous beads, and pendants. 3) When one combines the Palaeolithic carvings with ethnographic data, it becomes possible to form a judgment about the social relations of that time, and about beliefs of Palaeolithic man which were conditioned by them. The image of the woman who was embodied in the female figurines reflected the important role of the Woman- Mother in the life of Upper Palaeolithic society. This role was interwoven with ideas of the woman as mistress of the home, hearth and domestic fire - the female ancestress with a special magical power which assured success in the basic source of life, the hunt. The Palaeolithic female figurines correspond to the initial stage in the evolution of the image of woman, i.e., the comprehension of them as collective spirits and as images of real living Woman-Mothers . Along with the cult of women during the Upper Palaeolithic, there was also a widely developed cult of animals, and hunting magic rituals existed. The aspiration not only to kill the animal but to possess it as well was reflected in the magical subjects of Palaeolithic art, and in this can be seen another side of primitive magic, the idea of fertility which in- separably links the cult of animals with the cult of the Woman-Mother. Subsequently appeared the con- cepts about the zoomorphic totemic ancestor. The ancient cult of animals undoubtedly passed over a long and complicated path in its development. There is no preference shown for any one particular kind of animal in Palaeolithic art. Side by side with</page><page sequence="90">90 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 the animals whose portrayals had an immediate eco- nomic significance there existed images of carniv- ores as well as snakes, birds, and fish. The birth of totemic representation made its appearance in this epoch. The widely distributed form of an ornament in the form of disks which are sometimes decorated with rays emerging from the center is indicative, most likely, of the rudimentary, though complex, cosmogonie ideas and is also evidence of his cult of the elements of nature along with the portrayals of birds and snakes. The specimens of Palaeolithic art permit one to pass judgment on the fairly high development of esthetic concepts and of esthetic feelings as such. The specimens of Palaeolithic carving discov- ered in the territory of the U.S.S.R. indicate that during the glacial period there existed here a rich and original art executed by hunters of the mammoth and reindeer. This art combines the basic features of primitive realism with definite elements of styli- zation and schematization.</page><page sequence="91">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 91 TABLES</page><page sequence="92">92 Arctic Anthropology IV-2 TABLE l.

Rogachev During excavations of the Palaeolithic site of Anosovka II (Kostenki XI) in 1956 and I960 there was obtained, along with the flint and bone tools, a considerable quantity of small pieces of marl with clearly expressed traces of working. The presence among these finds of individual animal figurines which were treated schematically and in a conven- tionalized fashion enables us to see in these arti- facts artistic productions of our remote ancestors who inhabited our country in the late glacial period. Before describing these interesting finds - and documents of the artistic activity of people of the Old Stone Age are relatively rarely encountered - it is necessary to give a short summary about the cir- cumstances of the find and about the conditions of the deposit. The Palaeolithic site of Anosovka II is located in the center of the widely known Kostenki group of Stone Age sites which are located on the eastern margin of the Central Russian highlands on the Don near Voronezh. They occupy the end of the central promontory in the widened mouth portion of Anosova Ravine; the site is located alongside of Zamiatnin's site (Kostenki II). The excavations showed that Anosovka II is a first class stratified Upper Palaeolithic site con- taining the remains of five settlements which re- place one another in succession, and which are characterized not only by splendid complexes of flint and bone tools, but also by well preserved re- mains of dwellings; in the course of uncovering the latter, art objects were also recovered. In terms of its scientific value, Anosovka II is not inferior to such widely known sites as Kostenki I and the Tel'- manskaia Site, the study of which made it possible to really present the complex and many-facetted process of cultural development during the Upper Palaeolithic in the center of Eastern Europe and also to pose the problem of a concrete historical elucidation of the role of Eastern Europe in the late stage of the Old Stone Age. The geological structure of the Quaternary de- posits which contain these cultural remains of various periods at Anosovka II is analogous to the structure of the other sites of the district (Rogachev 195 7:122, Fig. 60). The lowest or 5th cultural level lies at a great depth, evidently in the lower stratum of buried humus and is assigned to the sites of the Kostenki-Sungir1 culture. In I960 in the northern part of the site we succeeded in finding, along with other cultural remains, a bifacially worked, trian- gular point with a concave base. The cultural re- mains of the 4th level, which, like the 5th and 3rd, were studied over a limited area, lie in the upper stratum of buried humus and are represented by in- dividual broken flints and fragments of bone. The three upper cultural levels are associated with the overlying stratum of loess-like loam. The 3rd (middle) cultural level contains distinctive flint tools in the form of leaf-shaped points retouched only on the under side. The 2nd cultural level is represented by the remains of an above-ground dwelling, during the investigation of which were collected large numbers of flint tools and the collection of artifacts of marl to be described here. The upper, or 1st, cultural level is represented by two different complexes of finds, a northern and a southern. The southern complex is inadequately studied but the northern represents the ruins of a large dwelling in the construction of which a large number of mammoth bones were utilized - tubular, flat, and skull. The collection of marl arti- facts to be described was collected in the middle part of a small dwelling in the 2nd level amidst the usual debris of habitation consisting of a great quan- tity of tiny bone fragments, broken flints, and bone charcoal (Rogachev 1961). In contrast to Kostenki I and IV there were in the cultural level here almost no unworked pieces of marl. In all, our collection numbers approximately 200 objects of marl. They consist of figurines of mammoths, rhinoceroses, strongly schematized unidentified figurines of ani- mals, and fragments of objects made of marl. On the whole, the entire complex of marl artifacts from Anosovka II is characterized by small size and ex- cessive conventionalization of treatment. The re- alistic figurines and heads of animals are lacking. In addition to these art objects of marl, there are only two of the same type of bone fibulae with the end in the form of the realistic head of an animal on one of them, and with a schematized head on the other. Carved portrayals of mammoth in Anosovka II are the most numerous. In the collection there are twelve entire and almost entire figurines with heads and three typical fragments of them. To this series we must also assign 50 small hemispherical arti- facts and 38 fragments of the same which can be considered as even more schematized portrayals of this animal. The dimensions of the figurines of mam- moth range from 27 X 20 X 20 mm. to 10 X 8 X 5 mm. All the figurines of mammoth are of the same type and represent massive hemispherical artifacts with a wide flat base. On the fifteen most expressive examples (12 whole and 3 fragments) the hemispherical</page><page sequence="102">102 body of the mammoth has the characteristic sparingly- expressed head. The whole figurine calls to mind in an unusually animated fashion the figure of this corpulent clumsy animal (PI. XXIII: 1-15). The image of the mammoth embodied in these carvings is so characteristic and striking that there is no doubt whatever among specialists - zoologists, archaeologists, and art historians - as to the identi- fication of the species of animal. The image of the mammoth is widespread in the art of the Upper Pa- laeolithic of Europe and Asia, depicted equally in engravings and carvings over the whole expanse from the Pyrenees to the banks of the Angara. The keen powers of observation of the primitive sculptor and his faculty for precisely catching the general contour of the animal on the one hand, and the careful finishing of the surface of the figurine by planing down with a flint knife and polishing with an abrasive on the other hand, gives a special ex- pressiveness and animation to the image. Behind the seeming simplicity and uncomplicatedness of the form of these figurines is concealed a high de- gree of craftsmanship. All the figurines of mam- moth, both those with a head and also those of simple hemispherical form, consist essentially of three and even of two elements - a body, a flat base, and a head, with the latter in every case being de- void of any sort of details. Although there is a certain standardization in the shaping of the body and base, the head of these figurines is rendered in the most diverse fashion. On certain figurines the head is very small (PI. XXIII: 4 &amp; 10). On others it occupies almost half of the figurine (PI. XXIII: 5). On part of the figurines the head is merged with the body and separated by a shallow cut. On certain of the figurines the head is shaped in such a way that there is doubt as to the identification of the ani- mal (PI. XXIII: 1 and 9). For example, the figurine shown in PI. XXIII: 1 recalls a bear rather than a mammoth when viewed on its side. However, the erroneousness of such an impression becomes clear if we look at the figurine from above. Then the eye is struck by the wide, massive hind part of the figurine which is distinctive of the whole group of mammoth carvings. One can hypothesize that the size of the head and its position relative to the body was determined by the pose of the animal. For example, the figurines in PL XXIII: 1 and 12 are similar to a swiftly running mammoth, while the figurine in PI. XXIII: 5 depicts a mammoth that is stuck in a bog. The form of the body and the form of the flat base of the figurines is mutually coordinated. The widest part of the figurine is always its lower part; as a result of this the mammoth figurines have a squat and flattened form. Of this sort in particular are the hemispherical figurines lacking heads. However, the strictly defined egg-shaped form of Arctic Anthropology IV-2 the flat base - in the form of an oval narrowing toward the front end - and the corresponding (with the base) massive body with thickened, semi-circular hind part testify without doubt to the fact that the figurines with heads and the flattened hemispherical objects belong to one and the same category of schematized mammoth figurines (PI. XXIII: 27-34). This is also evidenced in particular by the fact that among the headless figurines many have a slightly elongated form. On certain figurines the highest pointed part is displaced foreward representing the head while at the same time the hind part, wider and sloping, to a certain degree recalls the body on the carvings with heads. The flat base of many headless figurines also has an egg-shaped form and the sharpened part of the oval is directed foreward, but along with this many of these hemispherical objects are schematized to such a degree that the form of their prototype can- not be sensed in them. One of these hemispherical objects was converted into a pendant or a bead by means of a biconical hole in the middle of its flat base (PI. XXIII: 25). The presence of really miniature headless figu- rines whose height, length and width is less than 1 cm. , presumably enables us to interpret them as portrayals of young individuals. It would be just as logical, however, to see in them adult mammoths. Gazing, for example, at a herd of grazing mammoths, people could recall in detail only the nearest ani- mals while the more distantly situated they could portray only in general terms and in a considerably reduced scale. It must not be forgotten that the highly developed art of the Palaeolithic period was capable of portraying an object in perspective. How- ever, this still does not mean that the people of that period had a complete understanding and feel- ing for perspective. The latter (perspective) in par- ticular could have been expressed through an ap- propriate arrangement of figurines on a plane surface. In our collection there are in all only two slightly damaged figurines of rhinoceros and three charac- teristic fragments of figurines. The technique and manner of their execution is the same as on the mammoth figurines (PI. XXIII: 16-19). The whole, slightly damaged, schematized figurine of a rhinoc- eros is distinguished by precision of expression of the form and by the very careful finish of the whole surface. The length of the figurine is 25 mm.; height, 16 mm.; and thickness, 11 mm. Similarity with nature is achieved here by a simple means: the rendition of one characteristic feature of this animal, the presence on the head of a large pro- jecting horn. In contrast to the mammoth figurines, the body of the rhinoceros is longer, less fat, and higher. Despite the similar flat base, the rhinoc- eros figurines are not flattened. This is achieved by the circumstance that the widest part corresponds to the convex sides and not to the flat base as on</page><page sequence="103">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U .S.S.R. the mammoth figurines. The high, slightly rounded hump separated by a scarcely visible hollow from the slightly sloping backward croup; the low place- ment of the head with the characteristic hook up- wards; the absence of legs, tail, and any sort of other details - all this clearly and in animated fashion reproduces the contours of precisely a rhi- noceros (PI. XXIII: 16). The second figurine is identical with the one described (PI. XXIII: 17); its body is also slightly damaged. There is no doubt about the fact that all three fragments of rhinoceros figurines belong to this same type of marl artifact since they represent the front half of the same figurines with flat base and preserve the high hump and the projecting low slung head which is characteristic of them. The impression is created that one fragment of rhinoc- eros figurine (PI. XXIII: 19) was in process of manu- facture; owing to this, most likely the head re- mained without final finishing and the acute angle of the hump was not smoothed. The second fragment was perhaps deliberately broken: Traces of a blow in the form of a sufficiently expressed defect are visible at the left side on the flat base. The third fragment was polished along the line of fracture; there is therefore possible doubt as to whether this fragment belongs to the figurine of a rhinoceros. But the deep cut which emphasized the head, the adjoining part of the flat base, and also the strong bevel of the polished fracture on the right confirm that this fragment belongs to a rhinoceros figurine. Here we must emphasize one other essential detail of all the schematic figurines of animals known to us including those from other sites: on all of them without exception the base is smoothly and evenly polished. The figurines are very symmetrical and their plane of symmetry is vertical. Cases of viola- tion of symmetry (for example on the figurines shown in PI. XXIII: 1 1 and 12) are easily explained by subsequent damage. As a special third group of figurines from Ano- sovka II, we distinguish the even more conven- tionalized representations of animals whose species identification can be determined only approximately with considerable doubt. In manner and technique of execution they are identical to the figurines of mammoth and rhinoceros described above, but they have elongated proportions which distinguish them from the mammoths. They are distinguished from the rhinoceroses by the different profile of the back. The rhinoceros figurines have in front a high hump and a slight depression which separates the hump from the slightly drooping and thickened hind part. The size of the largest of these figurines is 34 X 22 X 19 mm. and of the smallest, 20 X 13 X 13 mm. One of the figurines (PI. XXIII: 21), on the basis of its outlines and the character of the base, evi- dently represents a mammoth, but the absence of 103 a head and the elongated form make it doubtful whether we can assign it to the category of mam- moth figurines described above. A second elongated figurine of an animal is very similar in form and type to the rhinoceros figurines, but it lacks the charac- teristic trait of the latter which consists in the low placed head (PI. XXIII: 20). Even taking into consid- eration a certain amount of damage to the front part of this figurine, it is still not possible to accept it as either a mammoth or a rhinoceros. It is evidently a representation of a bison. Of corresponding type is the figurine of a horse known from the upper horizon of Kostenki IV which has strongly elongated dimen- sions and the sagging back characteristic of horses. Similar to the animal figurines in technique and man- ner of manufacture are the artifacts in the form of a regular cone beveled on one side and slightly trun- cated, the form of which is by no means fortuitous (PI. XXIII: 3 7). In the collection of marl artifacts there are also some 80 pieces of marl with clear traces of working. They all represent either frag- ments or pieces of marl on which work was not com- pleted. Also found were fragments of objects in the form of spindle whorls (PI. XXIII:24, 36) which are known also in Kostenki IV. Widely distributed are pieces of marl with various figured cuts, examples of which are shown in PI. XXIII: 22 and 23). The frag- mentary and unfinished nature of the marl artifacts of this kind limits their subjective treatment. In conclusion one must record the presence among the pieces of worked marl of a very large one (48 X 35 X 37 mm.) with even and flat base. Along its sides there are two deep and identical cuts, symmetrically located, and produced evidently with a slightly curved flint knife (PI. XXIII: 38). Among the bone artifacts which may be assigned to the category of art objects it is important to men- tion the two bone fibulae with tops in the form of animal heads previously mentioned which were carved out of the sides of tubular bones of horses and evi- dently served as ornaments for clothing. One of these, 71 mm. long, seemingly represents an awl, the whole surface of which was planed down and strongly polished (PI. XXIII: 26). The hind part of this object opposite the awl-like end was shaped in the form of a gracefully carved head of a large car- nivore, most likely a wolf. The head is rather ex- pressive; the muzzle is pointed, and on the very tip of it a small mouth is indicated by a cut. The eyes are noted and small knobs are visible in the place of the ears. The head is slightly asymmetrical. Its left half, together with the forehead and the left ear, is slanted backwards and to the left. The sec- ond analogous fibula is fashioned schematically and carelessly. The head is portrayed in a convention- alized fashion, the neck is distinguished by a deep cut and emphasized below by a marked projection. The head is without any details although it as well</page><page sequence="104">104 as the whole object has been smoothed and pol- ished to a considerable extent (PI. XXIII: 35). Its length is 59 mm. , the tip being slightly broken off. In this case it is important to note that among the carvings, both in marl and in bone, the portrayals of animals are represented both more realistically and also more schematically. If we attempt to date more precisely the art ob- jects described above we must note first of all that the second cultural level in Anosovka II is a site of a late stage of the Upper Palaeolithic period. It is very close in time to the upper horizon of the Aleksandrovka site and to the upper level of Kos- tenki I as evidenced not only by the similarity of the geological and geomorphological context of all these sites, but also by the close similarity of the art objects themselves. The evolved forms and methods of portraying animals do not allow us to see here the first steps Arctic Anthropology IV-2 of the artistic activity of primitive man. However, with a more profound study of the problem, the art works described undoubtedly can be assigned to the oldest stage of the evolution of art. At this time in representational art which was closely linked with the life of the primitive community, the most widespread images were those of the animals which played a decisive role in the economic activities of the people - given their hunting mode of life. The predominance of the animal images in Palaeolithic art is evidence of the fact that this art was not only linked in the most intimate way with the life of the community but was also directly interwoven with their economic activities. Artistic creativity in clan society was considered as a necessary con- dition of the successful hunt equivalent to the ac- tivity expended in the manufacture and perfection of equipment for the hunt.</page><page sequence="105">Abramova: Palaeolithic Art in the U.S.S.R. 105 ABBREVIATIONS AIChPE - Assotsiatsiia po Izucheniiu Chetvertich- nogo Perioda Evropy GAIMK - Gosudarstvennaia Akademiia Istorii Material 'noi Kul'tury GE - Gosudarstvennyi Ermitazh, Leningrad GE OIPK - Gosudarstvennyi Ermitazh.
