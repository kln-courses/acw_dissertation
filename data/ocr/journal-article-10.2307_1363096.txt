<plain_text><page sequence="1">PUBLICATIONS REVIEWED CHAPMAN ON HABITS OF OROPENDOLA.* -The present reviewer never saw an oropendola and never hopes to see one- alive, in the wild; but he has seen pic- tures of their remarkable, pendant nests and has examined the strikingly colored study-skins of the bird. Now, Dr. Chap- man provides a wonderfully appealing, intimate field study of the species, so that we have the bird as it is in life sharply visualized, permanently so, even though second-hand. Dr. Chapman's field study of Zarhynchus wagleri impresses us as an ideal example of what rigidly conducted scientific obser- vations should constitute and lead to. We gather that his observations of the bird at Barro Colorado Island, Canal Zone, was carried on in a patient, hence some- what leisurely, fashion-the same fea- tures of behavior, on the part of the birds, scrutinized over and over again by means of high-power glasses (needed in this particular case because the nests were at considerable distance, and far aloft, from the nearest observation post); the observer seated, comfortably, drawing and writing board before him, undis- tracted. He was able to see and to verify what the birds were doing, and then was able to draw, gradually, one insight lead- ing to another, his final inferences as to why the things were done. The story of oropendola that resulted reminds us in many respects strongly of the account of Red-winged Blackbirds, as Dr. Arthur A. Allen has recorded his study of them. Both these birds are icterids; doubtless they do exhibit fundamental similarities in behavior that signify not too remote community of origin. Also, from what we have learned of its habits through casual observation, our Arizona Hooded Oriole shows traits remindful of oropendola. *The- Nesting Habits of Wagler's Oropendola (Zarhynchus wagleri) on Barro Colorado Island, by Frank M. Chapman. Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., LVIII, December 31, 1928, pp. 123-166, pls. 1-8.</page><page sequence="2">May, 1929 PUBLICATIONS REVIEWED 135 Incidentally, we must point out certain blemishes in this paper. Citations will indicate their nature. It is said of the bird Legatus, which appropriates for its own use nests of oropendola: "its motives are unworthy". Again: "The poor oropen- dola sits humbly . . . waiting for a chance to enter her own home", etc. In an osten- sibly scientific paper this sort of thing, it seems to me, is wholly indefensible. Sentiment, anthropomorphism, have no place at all in real ornithology. They tend to obscure rather than to clarify in- terpretations of animal behavior. It was Dr. J. A. Allen, forty-five years ago, who said of some author: "[He] fails to dis- tinguish clearly between the science of ornithology and the sentiment of orni- thology-both legitimate in their way, and not necessarily antagonistic, though not always compatible" (Auk, I, 1884, p. 302). But, forgetting this very common type of "blemish", we wish again to express the warmest approval of this latest paper of Chapman's; and we wish every pros- pective writer on bird behavior would read it and study it, and then pattern his own methods and resulting exposition after it, Furthermore, no one need go to Central America to find many a subject of quite as interesting character as oropendola; no one organism is, from the truly scien- tific viewpoint, more "interesting" than another! There is an astonishing lack of thorough- going natural history available concern- ing even our commonest North American birds. For example, we recently tried to find out something about Song Sparrows, any western subspecies; we failed com- pletely, save for the usual uncritical, im- pressionistic, vague type of account such as appears over and over again, with sug- gestive similarity, in the usual run of bird books. And from Audubon down, with only a few refreshing exceptions, this sort of ornithological literature seems to be getting worse! When a distinguished ornithologist like Chapman reaches a point where he deems it worth while to devote months of his time to studying the habits of one kind of bird, then there can be no question as to the worthiness of this pursuit on the most scientific of grounds.-J. GRINNELL, February 20, 1929.</page></plain_text>
