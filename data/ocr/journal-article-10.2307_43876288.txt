Burlington House, Picadilly, London, 1665-8. James Gibbs and Colen Campbell Mark Jarzombek From Corridor (Spanish) to Corridor (English); or, What's in Your Corridor? Corridors these days are so ubiquitous that one can hardly imagine that they actually have "a history." But up until the 1850s, corridors were a rarity even in large public buildings, and insofar as they were even mentioned in the literature of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, they were inevitably described as dark and lonely places, sometimes even haunted. Marquis de Sade imagined them filled with trap doors; Charlotte Brontë visualized them as places for restless soul-searching; George Byron made them into convenient props for the Romantic soul. "But glimmering through the dusky corridor," he wrote in 1814 in Corsair , "Another [lamp] chequers o'er the shadow'd floor." 1 But by 1877, when Henry James wrote The American , the corridor had come of age in the world of business and government. He passed his arm into that of his companion and the two walked for some time up and down one of the less frequented corridors. Newman's imagination began to glow with the idea of converting his bright, impracticable friend into a first-class man of business.2 The cause of this turn- around will be the subject of the next paper. Here, I will only have space to discuss the pre- 6 history, so to speak, of the corridor. I should add that I mean very specifically the word corridor, and not just any long passageway. Nomen est omen. The purpose of this exercise is to add a layer of thought - modest perhaps, but not insignificant - to our understanding of the formation of modern spaces. I would like to suggest that the corridor's history engages various cultural formations before becoming the typical feature of the modern office and school; it had to jump across national boundaries (from Spain to England) and across the domains of various building typologies (from defensive military architecture to domestic architecture to civic architecture), migrations that do not easily anticipate the word's eventual position in architectural vocabulary as one of the last significant neologisms, becoming, in fact, a flash point in debates about modern epistemological conceptions. In today's world, where corridors have been often criticized for their association with the bureaucratic mind- set, it might come as a surprise that the corridor, at its most fundamental historical level, is a legacy of the Spanish Empire and is thus connected with a particular type of modernism, the origins of which have nothing to do with bureaucracy, but with a mid- seventeenth century image of a well-oiled imperial world.</page><page sequence="2">Figure 4.

Dumont The "Coridoor" and its Origins A corridor , initially, was not a space but a person, one who, as its Latin root suggests, could "run fast"; that at least was its primary definition in the famous Tesoro de la Lengua Castellana o Española of 1611, the first dictionary of the Spanish language. The dictionary lists several other meanings. A corridor could be a scout sent behind enemy lines to probe their defenses; he could be an intergovernmental messenger, and even a negotiator, arranging, in particular, mercantile deals and marriages.3 In the sixteenth century, corridore were still in use by the Spanish government criss-crossing Europe with money, messages and confidential reports. The word's secondary meanings have to do with protected spaces on fortifications that allow for rapid communication or deployment of troops. This was the usage of the Italian version of the word, corridoio (a "running place"), which, as far as I can determine, never referred to a person. An early documentable example of the word can be found in Giovanni Villani's treatise on the history of Florence, the Cronica Universale (1324), where the author refers to a corridoio on the city walls of Florence.4 One of the most famous corridoio of all time was erected in that city in 1565 by the Medici to connect the Pallazo Pitti with the Uffizi, running not around the city, but right into its center.5 This etymological history reminds us that up until the seventeenth century, in architecture proper, there were no corridors; a palazzo was entered by means of an andito (from the word andare "to go"), which might have given way to a camminata 6 (a "walking place") or a passaggio , which, if it was running along a courtyard might have been called, from the fifteenth century onward, a portico. Neither Palladio nor Serlio ever used the word corridor. They rarely even had hallways in their designs given that villas were usually composed of tightly interlocked rooms bound within pilastered skins. One of the first documentable uses of the word in architecture that I have been able to trace is in a plan for a house designed in 1644 by Felice Della Greca in which the building's entrata is connected with the giardino in the rear by means of a " coritore ," (the spelling no doubt refiecs the Italian's unfamiliarity with the term).7 This coritore was not particularly grand and could easily have been mistaken for an andito , but it was precisely not an andito ; nor was it a corridoio , for it had no military purpose. In emphasizing the equivalency between a "running 7</page><page sequence="3">man" and a "running space," it was a status symbol, meant to imply that its owner was being kept abreast of world events by fleet-footed messengers. And so, in an almost magical moment of transliteration, from walking to running, and from local politics to world politics, a new element in the semantics of prestige was born, emphasizing not the dignified pace of old along an andito , but a pace that was purposeful and targeted - a pace, one has to add, that was of a modern dimension. For if there is anything that clearly marks the transition to modernity, it is the need for speed; and for the rulers of the Spanish Empire, who had to bring together information from Austria, Holland and the far-reaching colonies, speed was a necessity. Couriers were known to cover up to 185km per day, meaning that the Spanish commanders frequently got their information long before their opponents did.8 The imprint of Spanish courier system is still with us in the word "taxi," which derives from the name Tassi, the family who were put in charge of facilitating the flow of Spain's European dispatches. Anglicanizing the Corridor The shift between an Italian andito and an Italianized- Spanish coritore might have been too subtle or perhaps even too regional to have changed architecture in any significant way if the term had not been adopted by the English, who used it not for just any building, but for one of the most prestigious palaces of the time, the huge Castle Howard, commissioned in 1698 for Charles Howard, third Earl of Carlisle. The building, designed by John Vanbrugh, has a central body that consists on its piano nobile of a great square hall with the principal apartment, also square, directly behind it. One stretch of space, labeled corridoor , cuts across the front of the great hall and curves around toward the side wings. A second corridoor runs along one side of the entire stretch of the apartment wing. One could, of course, argue that long thin buildings by necessity required corridors, but this is easily disproved if one looks at the ground plan of Petworth House, built more or less at the same time as Castle Howard; despite its vast frontage, it had no corridors, apart from the usual cramped passageways in the servant's quarters. One could also compare Castle Howard with Burlington House (1665-8) by James Gibbs, which was, of course, modeled on Palladian villas where there were no corridors (Fig. 1 &amp; 2). So why do çorridoors suddenly appear in this building? It could be explained by the fact that many in Vanbrugh's generation, had a fascination for things Spanish. On a culinary front, the dish "Spanish olio," a mixture of meat 8 and vegetables, had become all the rage in London, as had the English translation of Don Quixote.9 Vanbrugh even wrote a play set in Spain, The False Friend (1709). One also has to take into consideration that in the late seventeenth century military terminology had begun to spread in common language.10 Palaces were even laid out with fake fortifications, and the corridor , "a foreign word of Italian or Spanish extraction," as Ephraim Chambers defined it somewhat loosely in his Cyclopaedia , (ca. 1680-11 AG), was still a pre-eminently military term.11 Vanbrugh was certainly knowledgeable about military architecture as he had once thought of embarking on a military career. But the corridors of Castle Howard have to be understood within a larger perspective. Charles Howard, a strong supporter of the Whigs, was a prominent figure in the politics of the age, a minister for William III, member of the Privy Council and also, briefly, Lord of the Treasury. William III (1650-1702), a Dutch aristocrat, ruled England together with Mary II, and allied himself with the Spanish against the French who had invaded Holland in 1672. Once installed as King of England, he maintained close relations with Spain, signing the Treaty of Madrid in 1670 and the Treaty of Windsor in 1680 and another in 1685, all aimed to rid the Caribbean of French buccaneers. The treaties also formally launched the English Caribbean expansion, with Britain taking formal control of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands and thus establishing a strong foothold in the lucrative sugar industry. The warm relations between England and Spain paid off in the War of the Grand Alliance against France with a victory for England and Spain. The war came to an end in 1697, one year before the commissioning of Castle Howard, which means that the building served purposefully and ostentatiously as a proclamation of England's arrival on the world stage. In that respect, it was the predecessor to the more famous Blenheim Castle, also designed by Vanbrugh though with the help of William Hawksmoor, which, as mandated by Parliament, celebrated England's victory over the French in a battle at Blenheim, Germany. That building too had corridoors running away from the huge main hall. It is not an accident that in Colen Campbell's 1715 Vitruvius Britannicus Blenheim Castle and Castle Howard were the only two buildings among the dozens featured in the book that had corridors. The word was novel enough, however, that Vanbrugh, in a letter to the Duchess of Marlborough, felt the need to explain it: "The word Corridor, Madam, is foreign, and signifies in plain English, no more than a Passage, it is now however generally used as an English Word."12 The condescending casualness of the explanation should not belie the implications of this innovation. The corridoors of</page><page sequence="4">Figure 6. Design for a Grande Maison, unexecuted, ca. 1780. Claude Nicholas Ledoux</page><page sequence="5">Figure 7. King Edward's School, Birmingham, 1838. Charles Barry Castle Howard with their purposeful overlapping of the military and the political, demonstrated, in the language of architecture, England's imperialist intentions and its usurpation of the technology associated with its new status as a colonial empire, namely speed. It was left to Robert Adam in a house now known as Luton Hoo (1772) in Bedfordshire to tame the corridor and coordinate it with the ideals of Italian planning (Fig. 3). Because the house was designed for the noted Tory, John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (1713 -1792), the corridor was clearly meant to reflect the impression of majesty the Tories, by then in control of English politics, wanted to see expressed in their architecture. Stuart, on the accession of George III in 1760, was the king's Privy Counselor and for a while even Prime Minister (1762-3), famous for having arranged the marriage between George III and the German Princess Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg- Strelitz. In 1763, John Stuart negotiated the peace treaty between England and France that ended the Seven Years War. Though the treaty was not popular in England where many thought that Stuart, a Scotsman, had been too soft on the French, history has born out the fact that the treaty, whatever its weaknesses, had established England as the world's chief colonial empire. Luton Hoo, which served as Stuart's retirement estate, was clearly meant to commemorate his international career. A wide corridor cleaves the house into two and terminates in grand staircases at both ends.13 Matching oval spaces to the right and left of the central Salon serve as transitions between the corridor and the 10 bedroom suites. The integration of the staircases with the placement of bathrooms, "powdering rooms," and service stairs in the shape of a flat U are also innovative. The very public and the very private have been extracted from the plan, so to speak, to be placed within their own circulatory core. The rooms in the house were not viewed as spaces of transit to other rooms, as was usual, but relatively tranquil entities, dialectically distinct from the bustling activities of the circulatory system. In fact, one could see the "served spaces" as having been freed from the clutter of the "service spaces" so that the served spaces, at the periphery, could better take command of the views, the landscape and gardens, as designed by the most famous landscape designer of the day, Capability Brown.14 John Stuart was considered one of England's leading bota- nists, and his extensive library with some thirty thousand volumes - one of the most complete scientific libraries in Europe - dominates the entire right-hand flank of the design. Perhaps one can see in this an early example of the shift of the corridor from a political space to an episte- mologica! one.15 I would thus venture to suggest that the building was designed as an anthropomorphic entity, with the Great Hall, the heart; the Salon, the head; the Portico, the eye; the two enclosed courtyards, the lungs; and the corridor, stairs and bathrooms, the circulatory system. The military interpretation is, however, also still possible, for the plan, unusual even for Adam, has unmistakable similarities to the Government House, in Pondicherry India, completed in 1752 (Fig. 4), which had a series of rooms accessed from the rear by a continuous corridor,16 except that at Luton Hoo, speed had been separated - more so than at Castle Howard - from program, this being, very truly, the prototype of the modern corridor. The corri- dor, in other words, did not bring one into the depth of the building, but to a threshold, both real and conceptual - a within in the within. In France, in the meantime, the word corridor also began to make its way into the architectural vocabulary, but one rarely sees the word anywhere on a plan other than in the servant's quarters, as can be seen in the design for a grande maison of Claude Nicholas Ledoux, for example, from about 1780 (Fig. 5). It would have been anathema to culture of the French elite to have had a corridor in a bedroom suite where the spatial alignment of rooms was less important than the degree of intimacy which was modulated by a series of ante-chambers and where privacy of bodily functions was often a non-issue, the king himself often receiving diplomats while dressing.17 Furthermore, the Palladian imperative to work without internal circula- tion - carried forth in mid- seventeenth century designs like that for the Barberini Palace (161628-38) - remained i i i i j A - pp__ *&gt;« - [«CONO I ļ r_jļ m t» ļ I mT C RAM MAR.

As a consequence, the corridor as a significant element in design remained rare in France. Beaux-Arts architects would inevitably use what we today might call courtyard- corridors, but which they consistently called galleries, colonnades , or colonnades couvert , with their allusions to historical precedent. The Darkening of the Corridor Despite the innovations of Castle Howard and Luton Hoo, the corridor was in truth a relative rarity even in England and especially during the Georgian and Regency eras, when architects remained strongly committed to the Palladian ideal.18 William Kent's Holkam Hall (1734) is just one example, even though the plan struggles to maintain cohesion in its arrangement of rooms. By the turn of the nineteenth century, the corridor had certainly lost its mystique and came to be equated not with the world of international power-brokerage, but with remote passageways in castles arid the nocturnal wanderings of old men in creaky mansions. Rarely used in architecture, corridor was drifting toward extinction, its functionality now its primary definition.19 Robert Kerr, author of The Gentleman's House (1864), for example, positioned the corridor lower in status to the French- derived gallerie because of its "utilitarian character."20 The corridor's negative associations hindered its progress into respectability even in a time when civic architecture was developing rapidly. Well into the 1820s, courthouses, one must remember, did not have corridors of any significance. Lawyers and clients were expected to meet in nearby inns or coffeehouses. Corridors could be found on the lower floor to connect offices, but this was driven by a need for the rationalization of space rather than by civic purpose. Even grand buildings, such as Schloss Wilhelmshöhe by Christoph Heinrich Jussow (1792), the US Capitol (1793) or the Massachusetts State House in Boston (completed 1798) had no corridors insofar as their prototypes were for the most part French (Fig. 6). Even the King Edward's School (1938), designed by Charles Barry, better known as the architect of the English Parliament building, had no corridors (Fig. 7). With this in mind, the redemption of corridic space in the mid- nineteenth century is actually quite remarkable, but that is another story, which will be subject of a subsequent article. * The second part of this essay "Le Corbusier and the Post-Corridic Alternative" will be published in Thresholds 33 Notes 1.

I want to thank my colleague Arindam Dutta for pointing out the importance of this particular aspect of the design. 15. Another precedent, evoking the still very distant uses of the corridor in the twentieth century, was the Gloucester Infirmary (1761) where we see the emergent institutional culture adopt the manner of the grand house, radically simplified and modified, of course. Here the corridor links the two wards; the central hall has become the chapel with the operating room above it on the first floor. It was designed, so it has been argued by Luke Singleton. The design was made around 1756. Patients were admitted in 1761. See further, http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp7comp id=42309;Internet; accessed 1 April 2005. 16. Pondicherry on the west coast of India was a French colony, but seized by the British three times during the eighteenth century. My argument, however, is not based on a possible cultural transmission; it is purely based on formal grounds. 17. Another comparison can be made with the Palazzo Corsini (begun in 1736) in Rome, which has galleries connecting important spaces and serving to define the structure's over-all geometry. Though here too there is a corridor, it is little more than a service-ally, squeezed into the fabric of the building. 18. Walpole in Strawberry Hill constructed what today would be called a corridor, but he called it a passage. 19. Today we say that panoptic prisons have corridors. But Jeremy Bentham called them galleries. They were, however, no doubt corridor-like. One must also remember that they were not circulation spaces, but optical spaces and free of circulation. 20.
