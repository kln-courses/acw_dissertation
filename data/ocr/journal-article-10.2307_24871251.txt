It was here that Moses saw the burning bush, conversed with God, and received the tablets of the Law. The extraordinary and desolate landscape of pink granite rocks has overwhelmed visitors for centuries, as Procopius attested in the sixth century: "a barren land extends for a great distance, unwatered and producing neither crops nor any useful thing. A precipitous and terribly wild mountain, Sina by name, rears its height close to the Red Sea."1 And it was here that Emperor Justinian (r. 527-565) built a monastery that survives to this day. What was the impact of this terrain on the divine visions recorded in the local textual tradition? Might the perception of the precipitous and barren mountains have artistically distilled in the form of the icon? This essay explores how landscape, scripture, and icon production interacted at Sinai. My analysis focuses on the way light affects the appearance of both terrain and icon and how these transformative effects are given a spiritual exegesis in the Old Testament, as well as in the writings of St. John Climacus (b. before 579, d. ca. 650) and St. Anastasios of Sinai (d. after 700), both of whom resided at the monastery. The pilgrimage tradition established by the late fourth century encouraged visitors to Sinai to link their experience of the terrain to the descriptions of the site found in the Old Testament. Pilgrims could thus become eyewitnesses to the theophanies revealed to Moses and Elijah.2 The treatises of John Climacus and Anastasios, both of whom wrote in the monastic community at Sinai, are replete with discussions of light and mountains, often imbuing these natural phenomena with metaphysical significance.3 This essay attempts to trace a connection between the radiance of the landscape and the performative aesthetic of glittering gold in the paintings preserved at Sinai.4 1.

Its earliest panels have been considered imports from Constantinople.7 Other early panels have been viewed as products of Jerusalem or Egypt.8 Yet already in the seventh century an icon of the prophet Elijah shows a concern for the local topography at Sinai (fig. 4); the prophet is represented with a scroll that records the very words he pronounced Robin Cormack, ed.

The iconographies of the Virgin of the Burning Bush and St. Catherine emerge as Sinai-specific compositions capable of addressing both Eastern and Western piety.10 Vita icons (pictorial cycles of a saint's life) originated at Sinai and similarly engaged the need to cater to the mixed Latin and Greek audience of the thirteenth century.11 Jas Eisner and Gerhard Wolf have claimed that many of Sinai's twelfth and thirteenth-century icons, which display iconography invested in local saints and holy sites, were intended to bolster piety by referencing sacred topography. The iconization of Moses, Elijah, and the Virgin of the Burning Bush, they have argued, counterbalanced the introduction of the relics of St. Catherine at the sanctuary, which was recorded by the early thirteenth century. The resulting dual scheme of piety at Sinai combined the old model of sacred topography, which mimetically connected images to the wilderness beyond the monastic walls, with the new devotion to the saintly relics displayed next to the altar.12 This essay focuses on the first branch of Sinai's dual piety—sacred topography—and explores the thematization of the landscape in text and image. I argue that the icon at Sinai underwent a development from a direct identification with the landscape outside the monastic walls to a medium-specific anthropomorphic figuration set in the radiance of burnished gold haloes. We do not possess contemporary medieval texts recording how and where these twelfth-century icons were made. In fact, there is a paucity of evidence about the monastery during the formative period from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries.13 My argument relies instead on the detection of a link among four elements: the landscape, the way it is envisioned in 9. 1 Kings 19:10 and 14.

With this framework in mind, it is important to emphasize the distinction between the provenance of the object and the localism its iconography and technique express. The burnished icons could have been produced within the monastery, in Constantinople, or in any other Mediterranean center where Sinai had outposts.14 Given this uncertainty, this essay aims not to sort out the objects' provenance, but to consider how the site's landscape shaped the scriptural semantic, which then distilled into the artistic form of the icon. Turning more precisely to the burnished-gold panels of the twelfth century, I argue that this group is unified first by a common choice of subject matter connecting Sinaitic saints to local sacred topography, and second by a technique of optical radiance that could signify a theological position against the graven image, which was defined in Exodus and the Psalms as a plastic form: glyptos in Greek and sculptilis in Latin. As a conceptually united group, these icons attest that they were intended to perpetuate Sinaitic identity. The scriptural response to Sinai's landscape The monastery of St. Catherine is situated in an arid land of red granite, its sixth-century fortification walls emerging halfway between the valley of stones and the dented peaks of Mount Sinai (fig. 1).15 In this stark 14.

Now the divine place is truly inaccessible and unapproachable, for not even the holiest mind is able to ascend such a height to it, so as merely to approach and touch it." Philo plays on the Greek batos, "burning bush" (from the Hebrew "senêh"), and abatos, "untrodden."

At sunset and sunrise the red granite glows a fiery red; at midday it shines in blinding radiance. We know that pilgrims like Egeria, who traveled to Mount Sinai in the late fourth century, read the appropriate passages from Exodus on site and projected the biblical past onto the landscape.16 This is how Exodus relates the theophany of the burning bush: Arid the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt (Ex. 3:2-3). The concentration on flame and fire draws attention to incandescent matter and a profusion of forms of the verb oraô (to see). The text encourages readers to activate their own sight, searching for moments when inert matter becomes alive, marked by the incandescence of fire. Sunrise and sunset produce such optical experiences, creating a brilliant contrast of radiant pink granite and sapphire-blue shadow. A corresponding passage in Exodus describes just this combination of incandescence and sapphire blue: and [there was] under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in [his] clearness. [...] And the sight of the glory of the Lord [was] like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel (Ex. 24:10 and 17). The first passage introduces the mountains as a sapphire blue foundation shining with the clarity of the sky, while the second speaks of flames devouring the peaks. Exodus thus offers a textual precedent that prompts visitors to Sinai to perceive changes in light across the landscape as epiphanic, manifesting divine presence. The scripture insists that the polymorphous and polychromatic appearance of the granite constitutes a theophany. This correlation between the landscape at Sinai and the Old Testament description of past visions at Sinai is confirmed by Egeria's description of her visit there. She states how a relevant passage from scripture was read at the very spot where the sacred event took place: "All there is on the actual summit of the central mountain is the church and the cave of holy Moses. No one lives there. So when the whole passage had been read to us from the Book of Moses (on the very spot!) we made the Offering in the usual way and received Communion." 16. Egeria visited Mt. Sinai in 383 around Christmas; Itinerarum Egeriae IV. 1-3. Again referring to Mount Horeb, Egeria continues: "Indeed, whenever we arrived anywhere, I myself always wanted the Bible passage to be read to us."17 The practice of correlating terrain and Scripture supplied pilgrims with an ekphrastic record of theophanies that they could perceptually recognize in the physical appearance of the landscape. We encounter the same practice of locating the theophanic in the incandescence of the rocks in works loosely attributed to Anastasios of Sinai, abbot of the monastery in the last quarter of the seventh century.18 While modern scholars have questioned Anastasios's authorship of the Hexaemeron, it is significant that the medieval audience regarded this text as coming from his pen, possibly because of its Egypt-centered cosmology.19 The Hexaemeron focuses on Moses's vision at Sinai in which the first six days of Creation are recounted, investing the narrative with Christian exegesis. The Hexaemeron suggests a way of transforming landscape into theology. For instance, red earth and fire become, respectively, flesh and divine Spirit:20 Adam means "fire-red earth." Fire and earth: these are God and man, which a little while ago we interpreted as Christ. And the sun describes him too, since it possesses the hot element of fire and the dry element of earth.21 Red earth signifies materiality made incandescent by light; its fiery appearance marks the presence of spirit in matter and the establishment of the divine Law: He [the Lord] was fire, and there he spoke to Moses fire-hardened words. They ignite souls and burn out their matter.22 17. Itinerarum Egeriae IV.1-3, in Egeria's Travels, trans. J. Wilkinson (Warminster, 1999), pp. 109-111.

It was written by a fiery finger. It was engraved in fiery letters. And when it was given to the people, it says, Moses' face was shining with fire.23 Fire and light transform the appearance of matter, making it radiant (telaugës) and fire-like (pyroeides); this change is itself a marker of divine presence. The words of the Hexaemeron endow the perceptual metamorphosis of the rocks under the sun with a theophanic significance. The textual record thus draws the reader's attention to polychromatic change, recognizing the presence of the Holy Spirit in the shifting appearance of matter. The faithful are asked to rely on their sight and perceive the metaphysical in these phenomenal effects. Synaesthesis of sound and light Sight also has a synaesthetic correlative in hearing. The granite terrain reflects sound, causing reverberant afterglow and echoes. Exodus identifies the terrifying sound of the divine voice with thunder and trumpets: "there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud. . . . And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice" (Ex. 19:16 and 19). Procopius echoes this passage when he remarks on the terrifying sound of thunder travelling through this granite landscape: "[Justinian] built this church, not on the mountain's summit, but much lower down. For it is impossible for a man to pass the night on the summit, since constant crashes of thunder and other terrifying manifestations of divine power are heard at night, striking terror into man's body and soul."24 Gregory of Nyssa in his Life of Moses (early 390s) also draws on synaesthesis of sound and light when he describes Moses' encounter with the burning bush: [Moses] no longer received the marvel of the light with his sight alone, but (which is most astounding of all) his hearing too was illuminated by the rays of light. The light's grace was distributed to both senses, illuminating the sight 23.

Procopius, De aedificiis (see note 1), bk. 5, sect. 8, p. 357. with flashing rays and lighting the way for the hearing with undefiled teachings.25 As the text narrates, Moses' sight and hearing are simultaneously illuminated in rays of splendor (pheggos). The perception of sound is defined using words for light: ray, radiance, glitter (aktis, pheggos, augë, phôs, marmarygma). The last line sets a parallel between light as a halo surrounding (periaugazô) all that is visible (opseis) with a glitter of rays (marmarygma aktinôn). This optical radiance is matched by the clear sound of the undefiled teachings. Similarly, in Anastasios's Hexaemeron, the Law is written by the Lord's Spirit, who manifests as fire, storm, and blaring sound: For we are now interpreting scriptural law, written by the finger of God, with the voice of the Holy Spirit. It came in fire, mist, cloud, storm, quaking, and the trumpet blast of thousands of angels. The Law of the Lord is pure. The words of the Lord were hardened by intense fire. They were ignited on Sinai and so transmitted.26 The voice of Law, hardened by fire, ignites the surface of the rocks. Once again, the Hexaemeron shapes an aesthetic response to sound and light and interprets it spiritually. The apse mosaic at Sinai: Seeing God face to face While scripture and later texts written about Moses' theophanies prompted visitors to Sinai to interpret the changing optical and acoustic aspects of the landscape in metaphysical terms, the artistic tradition that developed at Sinai emphasized the power of vision as a direct means of encountering God.27 In the sixth 25.

While this juxtaposition of profile and frontal views has been extensively analyzed in art historical scholarship, heretofore its linguistic roots have not been recognized.28 In the Greek version of Exodus this transition from seeing God obliquely to a complete frontal encounter is enabled by the assonance created by the following cluster of words: opöpa meaning "view" or "face," from which derive ôpë, opsis (aspect or appearance); öpon, prosöpon (face); and ops, öps (eye or 28.

Phonetically similar, but deriving from a different root, a second ops designates "voice." Additional phonetic resemblance is introduced by opë (ope'ning, hole) and opisö (back). Here is an example of how this assonance functions in Exodus: And Moses hid his face (prosöpon); for he was afraid to look upon (enöpion) God (Ex. 3:6). And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift (opë) of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see (opso) my back parts (ta opisö,): but my face (prosöpon) shall not be seen (Ex. 33:22-23). Moses' desire to see God face to face—prosöpon, from pros- (frontally, toward) and öpon (face)—is thwarted when he is placed in the cleft of the rock (ope) and only allowed to see the Lord's back (ta opisö). The profile views of Moses in the mosaic visualize these phonetic puns. By contrast, Christ's frontality offers the viewer a nearness to God. The figures in the conch of the apse—Christ and the apostles and prophets who surround him—all inhabit an abstract space, freed from topographic specificity. The shape of the mosaic resembles an eye in whose iris stands Christ. This anthropomorphic reading of the gestalt finds some confirmation in another sixth-century source: Procopius describes the apse at Hagia Sophia as a face (prosöpon).29 At Sinai the apse as face (dps) literally acquires the countenance of Christ, offering the faithful visual proximity to the divine. Thus the assonance of ops (identifying two different entities: "face" and "voice") becomes manifested as a vision, suppressing the acoustic aspect of the divine epiphany. It is important to recognize the role of gold and the medium of mosaic in expressing the numinous. Scholars have identified the artists who produced the apse mosaic at Sinai as coming from Constantinople, yet the program is deeply invested in local sacred topography.30 The 29.

Weitzmann, "Mosaics and Wall Paintings," in Sinai: Treasures</page><page sequence="8">Pentcheva: The aesthetics of landscape and icon at Sinai 201 image transposes scripture into a visual form, showing how facing and seeing define the operative dynamic of the Christian faith. The medium of mosaic, with its dichotomy of light-reflecting and light-absorbing qualities, is capable of performing theophany not only pictorially but phenomenally as well.31 We also see a similar investment in the phenomenal aspect of light in the use of gold striations (chrysography) in some of the earliest painted icons at Sinai. The seventh-century panel of the Prophet Elijah is a case in point (fig. 4). Kurt Weitzmann hypothesized that this icon was locally produced.32 While we do not have written documentation to prove this, it is important to note how it uses chrysography to depict a body made radiant by the spirit. Elijah is shown at the very moment the divine word (rhêma) came to him. The light (phös) is the visual external marker of the transformative effect of theophany. This association is further enhanced by Elijah's name in Greek, Êliou, which is phonetically close to hêlios, meaning "sun." The radiance of this "sun prophet" is articulated by the shimmering network of gold lines. The Second Commandment at Sinai and the prohibition of glyptos/sculptilis If the capacity of vision to access the divine is emphasized by the apse mosaic at Sinai as well as the use of chrysography in some of its earliest icons, we must question how this Christian emphasis on sight relates to the ban on images given to Moses at Sinai as the Second Commandment: "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image [Gk: eidolon, Lat: sculptilis], or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them" (Ex. 20:4-5). At Sinai, this prohibition continuously resurfaced in local textual and visual forms of piety,33 and, I argue, led to the avoidance of plastic forms. In addition to the Second Commandment, other Scriptural passages identify the term eidolon with cult images of pagan gods.34 In the First Epistle to the Corinthians such objects are also called aphönos, without voice—mute effigies deceptively claiming of the Monastery of Saint Catherine, ed. K. Manafis (Athens, 1990), pp. 61-87, esp. 66; Cormack (see note 11). 31. Franses (see note 4), p. 22. 32. Weitzmann (see note 7), B17, pp. 42-43. 33.

While three dimensionality might be an aspect of the Greek term eidolon, the Latin Vulgate lifts all ambiguity by calling the banned object sculptilis, a plastic form. For the references to idol worship in the Psalms (Ps. 105 [106] :19, 35-38), the Vulgate consistently uses sculptilis, while the Septuagint introduces glyptos, a term that emphasizes the three-dimensional aspect of the effigy. This characteristic is further enforced by the identification of pagan idols with plastic forms: the Greek stëlê and choneutos, and the Latin statua and conflatilis (Ex. 34:13 and 17). During the Iconoclast controversy ninth-century illustrated Greek and Latin psalters from outside Sinai consistently depicted the scriptural glyptos/sculptilis as a three-dimensional statue on a column. Such effigies stand in marked contrast to the orthodox, two-dimensional nature of painting, the medium in which these artists were working.35 Eisner and Wolf have remarked that the proliferation of icons at Sinai, far from being evidence of idolatry, can rather be interpreted as "a post-Iconoclast commentary on (past) idolatry" that "build[s] a protective wall against idolatry in the present or future."36 The linguistic dimension I am adding here strengthens this point. The words sculptilis!glyptos define the banned image as a plastic form, and the monastery's icon collection likewise consists of images of tempera or encaustic; it does not include any bas-reliefs or mixed-medium panels.37 Painting, which has the capacity for mimesis, produces images on a flat surface. Gold, on the other hand, can 35. The Khludov Psalter (Moscow, State Historical Museum, MS Gr. 129, fols. 108v, 109v) depicts the glyptos as a statue in the round in Ps. 105:19, 28, 36-37. K. A. Corrigan, Visual Polemics in the Ninth Century Byzantine Psalters (Cambridge, 1992), pp. 35-37. The slightly earlier Stuttgart Psalter, produced ca. 820 (Stuttgart, Württembergische Landesbibliothek, MS Lat. Bibl, fol. 23) illustrates Ps. 105:19 with a huge golden calf set on a pedestal and two men approaching it with hands covered in their cloaks and grasping palm branches. The image is a travesty of piety, first because the object of adoration is a zoomorphic statue, and second because the palm branches, which are traditionally carried by martyrs themselves, are now wrongly appearing in the hands of the worshippers. Tiny figures of a goldsmith hammering molten metal on his anvil and a stonemason carving stone further condemn the sculptilis as a statue. B.

Unlike paint, it responds to moving diurnal light with coruscation. The icon of Elijah exemplifies this distinction between pictorial and performative animation; its gold introduces a performative, phenomenal aspect that is capable of enacting theology, staging the presence of the metaphysical (fig. 4). Radiance in the non-mimetic icon at Sinai The blending of mimetic (painted) and performative (radiant gold) aspects is present in the icon theory produced at Sinai. Anastasios writes of a non-mimetic image of God, which he identifies with Christ, the human soul, and Adam at the moment of Creation.38 This conceptualization of the "icon of God" centers on the transformation of the inert into the animate by the impartation of divine breath. The first book of Genesis states that God created Man in his own image, that is, as an "icon of God" (eikona theou, Gen. Ί :27), while the second describes how Adam became a "living soul" when God breathed into him (Gen. 2:7). This non-mimetic icon is produced by the act of in-spiriting; it offers a performative paradigm for iconicity, which contrasts with the representational model of the artist producing a painted likeness. The performative "image of God" is also connected to the liturgy and especially the Eucharist; by consuming the body and blood of Christ, the participants become temporal and ephemeral "icons of God."39 Anastasios probes the question of exactly how the human being is made to be an icon of God. He defines the "icon" as a reflecting mirror: "For the human being does not acquire some iconicity and likeness of God in one instance, but a second, third, fourth, and fifth time; it images the mystery of the divine tri-person hypostasis like a mirror or painting by imprint [typikos], not by essence."40 In this passage Anastasios argues that 38.

The concept of the performative, non-representational, icon has a long tradition predating Anastasios, going back to fourth- and early fifth-century patristic writings; see A. Vasiliu, Eikôn: L'image dans le discours des trois Cappadociens (Paris, 2010). 40.

He identifies this entity with the Greek typos, a term used to refer to the Eucharistic host and the descent of the Holy Spirit into matter; in this process the inert is transformed into something animate and radiant (dedoxasmenos). Anastasios envisions how splendor (doxa) is a marker δευτέραν κα! τρίτην και τετάρτηυ kcu πέμπτην, έξεικονίζων ώσπερ έν έσόπτρω χινι και σκιαγραφία τυπική, où φυσική, τ% τρισυιτοστάτου θεότητοί τό μυστήριον.</page><page sequence="10">Pentcheva: The aesthetics of landscape and icon at Sinai 203 of the Holy Spirit exhibited in matter: "how it [the Eucharist] dwells in our bodies as God and it keeps moving up and down, and how this clay body through the operation of the fire of the Holy Spirit henceforth becomes of like-shape to the splendor of the icon of Christ."41 The radiance of the material form exhibits the ephemeral partaking of the mortal body in the divine. In Exodus, Gregory of Nyssa, and Anastasios, divine epiphany manifests itself through concentric and centripetal radiance (periaugë). These texts read the landscape at Sinai as being imbued with and outwardly displaying the Spirit of God. The light at sunrise and sunset transforms the stone, giving it the appearance of fire. Yet after its fiery sojourn, the sun leaves the rock unchanged: a virginal body unconsumed by fire. The collection of burnished gold icons at Sinai If we now turn to the (mimetic) icons of Sinai, we encounter a similar dichotomy of flesh and spirit channeled through pigment and gold: the former pictorial and descriptive, the latter phenomenal and performative. Otto Demus first drew attention to the performative aspects of gold manifested in Byzantine monumental art, such as the mosaic of the Annunciation at Daphne.42 With its abstract gold ground, the scene rejects pictorial depth and unfolds the narrative action into the space of the church, where the Archangel and Virgin meet across the squinch. The Holy Spirit emerges non-mimetically in the glitter of the gold mosaic whenever a sunbeam touches the concave surface. Rico Franses has further engaged the phenomenal play of gold in mosaics and miniatures, focusing on its achromatic dynamic. The perception of color is overwhelmed by the "hot spots" created by gold, establishing an opposition of light-reflecting versus light-absorbing areas. As a result, the pictorial field polarizes into radiance and shadow. The duality is one of light and shadow rather than light and color. The mimetic aspect disappears and reappears depending on the effects of light and the position of the viewer.43 This radiance produced by light on gold—a performative aspect that manifests the Holy Spirit non 41.

Sôtêriou lists around sixty-two icons from the eleventh and twelfth centuries, approximately twenty-two of which have burnished gold haloes (slightly over thirty-five percent).47 44.

There are no written records about where these panels were produced. Only the templon beam has been securely attributed to Sinai because of its form and large size.48 As 48. The beam is made of a single piece of wood. K.

On the basis of style, Weitzmann originally attributed the panel of St. Nicholas to Constantinople, and this identification has remained in the field up to today (fig. 5).49 No written sources exist to confirm this hypothesis. Other attributions have also been made, all in the absence of firm textual evidence: The icon of the Miracle at Chonai has been identified as coming from Constantinople;50 the Crucifixion icon has been viewed as a local Sinai product;51 and the icon of the Heavenly Ladder has been attributed to a Constantinopolitan painter working at Sinai.52 The depiction of the named archbishop "Antonios" on this panel has been cited as evidence of local production; Sinai was one of the few places in the Eastern Mediterranean where the abbot was also an archbishop.53 Scholarly opinion thus oscillates between Constantinople and Sinai. Style and quality are considered indicators of Constantinopolitan production, while patron portraits signal local production. Since we do not have written records of how the collection at Sinai was amassed, I propose that instead of attempting to determine where these icons were produced, we focus our attention on what the technique of burnished gold does to the image and how it constitutes a sacred "landscape." The burnished gold haloes perform rather than depict radiance, manifesting it as a luminous, enveloping presence that distills the spatial dimension of the Greek word periaugê. Gregory of Nyssa used periaugizö to describe the radiance of Moses' face at the sight of the burning bush.54 Similarly, the Old Testament and Anastasios's writings about Sinai prompt their readers to discern spiritual presence in the radiance of the granite rocks when they are bathed in sunlight. The burnished gold technique of the icons translates this experience, enacting phenomenally what the texts recognize as the metaphysical dimension of Sinai's landscape. Sinai's icon of the Heavenly Ladder is especially effective at conveying the medieval conception of divinely inspired vision (fig. 7).55The panel illustrates 49.

John stretches to reach Christ, his hands just touching the cusp of heaven. Counterbalancing the diagonal ascent is a vertical descent of sinful monks falling from the rungs of the ladder, pulled down by the snares of devils. A group of monks at the lower right corner directs prayers of intercession toward an angelic host above left, hoping to fortify their ascending brethren as they are put to the test. The abbot, monks, angels, and devils populate a radiant but barren gold ground evocative of the Sinai desert. This unarticulated gold field collapses distance, much like the blazing-rocks of Sinai in the sun, while the ladder crossing it recalls the carved stairs in the granite slopes of the mountains (fig. 8).</page><page sequence="13">206 RES 65/66 2014/2015 The themes of ascent, light, and voice characterize the experience of theophany at Sinai and feature prominently in the written record. The Heavenly Ladder opens with a "Homily to the Pastor" that draws on the metaphor of climbing to praise the spiritual progress of the abbot of the neighboring monastery at Rhaithou: You not only killed the Egyptian [the Pharaoh] and hid the reward in the sand because of your humility, but you climbed the mountain and saw God in the thorny and inaccessible fellowship of wild beasts, and enjoyed the divine voice and splendor; and you have taken off your sandals, that is, all traces of mortality.58 John acclaims the abbot of Rhaithou as a new Moses, who has vanquished the Egyptians, climbed the mountain, and experienced the divine voice and radiance (phôtaugeia). The reader is invited to contemplate the thorny and inaccessible wilderness and the rocks illuminated by sunlight, both in their Mosaic historical dimension and in their potential to channel the epiphanic anew. And as in Exodus and Gregory of Nyssa, John Climacus recognizes the divine presence in the synaesthesis of voice and radiance. The homily continues on, replete with metaphors of climbing: Having ascended to the top, having rid yourself of darkness, gloom, and storm—that is to say, the triple beast of ignorance—you have come near a light more venerable, pure, and sublime than that of the burning bush, and have been deemed worthy of the voice and vision and prophecy. You saw somehow in advance, while still here [in this world] the future things, the future splendor of knowledge. And then you heard the voice [of God]: "No human could see [God]."Therefore, you descended from this theophany somehow to the deepest cleft of humility in Horeb, bringing with you somehow the tablets of knowledge and ascent, with a face glorified in spirit and body.59 58.

Gloom, darkness, and storm are juxtaposed with the blazing light (phôtismos) that inspirits his face, making it radiant (dedoxasmenos). The epiphanic is manifested in the terrain, in the transition from darkness to light, and most importantly, in the way that landscape transforms the abbot's face; it becomes luminous, like a mirror reflecting the surrounding light. It is significant that when John was writing this text, his visual referents were both the granite rocks outside the monastic walls as well as the Moses mosaics in the apse. The twelfth-century panel painting translates the non-mimetic icon of the landscape and the mimetic historical narrative of the mosaic into a portable pictorial synthesis. The icon of the Heavenly Ladder marks a new artistic development by channeling prayer in the direction of an intimate painted image. In chapter twenty-eight of the Heavenly Ladder ("On Prayer"), John identifies two exterior markers of true prayer: fire and radiance. These were the same phenomenal aspects of the Mosaic vision of the burning bush described in Exodus and by Gregory of Nyssa, as well as the inspirited matter that Anastasios associated with the sun, Christ, the soul, and Adam when God breathed life into him: When fire comes to dwell in the heart it resurrects prayer; and after prayer has been revived and taken up into heaven, a descent of fire takes place into the upper chamber of the soul. [...] But as for the latter [those who guard their hearts by means of the mind], it [the Holy Spirit] enlightens them in proportion to the perfection they have achieved. It is one and the same fire that is called that which consumes (cf. Heb. 12:29) and that which illuminates (cf. John 1:9). Hence the reason why some emerge from prayer as from a blazing furnace and as though having been relieved of all material defilements. Others come forth as if they were resplendent with light and clothed in a garment of joy and of humility. But as for those who emerge without having experienced either of these effects, I would say that they have prayed in a bodily, not to say a Jewish, manner, and not spiritually.60 δεδοξασμένοί και του σώματος; Scala Paradisi (see note 56), vol. 2, p. 369. 60.

In an ardent supplication, these two axes meet and merge, imbuing human flesh with a radiant glow. Phôs is the effect of true prayer, its outer appearance, marking the descent of pneuma. An absence of radiance likewise indicates unsuccessful prayer, a bodily supplication lacking pneumatic effects. When John wrote in the late sixth century, he did not envision monastic prayer centering on icons. It was rather the landscape outside the monastery that informed his conceptualization of prayer, the radiance of which had provided a backdrop for the visions of Moses. Yet, when prayer became linked to portable icons, as the Heavenly Ladder panel exemplifies, this new development in ritual practice preserved a continuity of the markers of epiphany: fire and radiance. The use of burnished gold enacted phôtaugeia in a portable and intimate format. Constantinopolitan manuscripts, Sinaitic icons Many of the burnished gold icons from Sinai (such as the Miracle at Chonai, the Kykkotissa, the Annunciation, and the Heavenly Ladder) function as pictorial exegesis, and are therefore deeply invested in texts (figs. 6-7).61 The technique of burnished gold so prominent in these icons also has a precedent in manuscripts: the gold leaf used in miniatures (fig. 12).62 It is therefore important to explore the possible links between the painters of these icons and the scribes/illuminators of manuscripts. In the second half of the eleventh century we have evidence of painters who were also scribes working in Constantinople. We witness in their illuminations the portrayal of prayer as an action focused on portable icons. The panel of the Heavenly Ladder is expressive of at least two of these trends: the desire to create a pictorial exegesis of the text and to channel prayer &lt;|&gt;gùtos πεφωτισμένοι, και διπλόίδα ταπεινώσεωϊ, και αγαλλιάσεων ήμφιεσμένοι.

In what follows, I will present a synthesis of some preliminary findings concerning Constantinopolitan manuscript production that helps reveal the genealogy of the Sinaitic icons. The earliest representation of the monastery at Sinai appears in one such manuscript—a copy of the Heavenly Ladder (Princeton, Garrett MS. 16), which according to its colophon was completed in 1081 by a scribe named Joseph.63 An image found at the end of chapter 26 (On Discernment"), identifies the monastery of Sinai as the site where John Climacus wrote his treatise and served as abbot (fig. 9). The miniature shows a mountain with sparse vegetation, identified as Sinai by a gold inscription. A bush with red blossoms creates a stark contrast to this desert terrain, alluding to the burning bush. At the summit of the mountain, a hermit in a cave lowers a basket; within the confines of the monastery below, a monk is shown holding a book. 63. S. Kotzabassi and Ν. P.

Photo: Courtesy Princeton University Library. These two figures exemplify anchoritic and cenobitic life, respectively. The miniature thus describes Sinai as a place of ascetic and visionary experiences that have inspired the production of texts. The same manuscript illustrates chapter 23, which centers on pride, with a monk in supplication before an icon of Christ (fig. 10). The image shows a similar mountain with a large cave. A monk, seeking protection against the devil, raises his hands in prayer toward the icon. This is significant, because the text does not mention the practice of focusing prayer on portable icons. The miniature thus shapes a new understanding of the treatise, one colored by eleventh century ritual practices.64 Garrett 16 is the earliest illustrated manuscript of the Heavenly Ladder, and shows a close collaboration between painter and scribe.65 It thus indicates how the scriptoria of Constantinopolitan monastic communities in the second half of the eleventh century started to articulate Sinai's topographic piety, which had long been invested in the landscape, and to identify this hallowed ground with icons. In some of its iconographie details Garrett 16 shows affinities to a group of eleventh-century manuscripts from the Stoudios monastery in Constantinople, which were produced by a scribe named Theodore. For the illustrations in all these books, Theodore directed a team of painters and thereby ensured the observance of a close connection between the illuminations and the subtleties of the text.66 This group of manuscripts gives special prominence to icons as a focus of monastic prayer that can provide access to the divine.67 The miniatures of a Physiologus manuscript produced under Theodore's direction included numerous representations of prayer before icons (Izmir/Smyrna, Evangelical School, Cod. B.8; no longer extant).68 This particular book also included excerpts from the sixth-century Topography of Cosmas Indicopleustes discussing Moses' encounter with God at Sinai.69This text is illustrated with an image of Moses contemplating the burning bush while an icon 64.

Rather than limiting his depiction to the text, the illuminator synthesized the concept of paradoxical virginal motherhood expressed through the metaphor of the burning bush by showing it materialized as an icon of Mary holding the Christ Child. The panel thus becomes the embodiment of the perfect vision seen by Moses at Sinai. This example attests to the transformation of the memory of the past through the insertion of then current (eleventh-century) Constantinopolitan devotional practices centered on icons. This process of translating texts into miniatures is also exemplified by two other cases, both of scribe illuminators in Constantinople. The first artist, named Constantine, produced one of the earliest illustrated manuscripts of John Climacus's Heavenly Ladder for the monastery of Louphadion near the gate of Hagios Romanos in Constantinople (Vat. gr. 394, ca. 1060-1084). Constantine's double role as miniaturist and scribe explains the deep interrelationship between text and image in this manuscript.70 His work is representative of a larger development of illustrated cycles exploring pictorial exegesis, such as the Heavenly Ladder, the Metaphrastian edition of saints' lives, and the narrative of Barlaam and loasaph, among others.71 It is important to note that many of these illustrated texts, including the Heavenly Ladder, had a popular appeal beyond monastic walls.72 They indicate a desire outside Sinai to make the meaning of these texts accessible in 70.

Lowden, The Octateuchs: A Study in Byzantine Manuscript Illustration (University Park, PA, 1992), pp. 80-86. Of this group of illustrated cycles, Francesco D'Aiuto identified three manuscripts written by the hand of Constantine: Vat. gr. 394 (Climacus); Athous, Dionys. 61 (Homilies of Gregory of Nazianzus); and Athous, Iber. 463 (Barlaam and loasaph). See F. D'Aiuto, "Su alcuni copisti di codici miniati mediobizantini," Byzantion 67 (1997): 1-59, esp. 25-34. 72. An illustrated manuscript of the Heavenly Ladder written in 1059 transmits the will of Eustathios Boilas, an owner of land in the eastern provinces of Byzantium (Paris, BnF, Coislin 263, fols. 159-165v). Boilas's testament mentions a copy of the Hodegos by Anastasios of Sinai that he leaves to his offspring along with the Climacus manuscript. See P. Lemerle, Cinq études sur le Xle siècle byzantin (Paris, 1977), pp. 15-63; S. Vryonis, Jr. "The Will of a Provincial Magnate, Eustathius Boilas (1059)," Dumbarton Oaks Papers 11 (1957): 263-277.

This process is significant not only because it privileges the image, but also because it manifests a desire to imagine Sinai and reify vision in the form of a portable icon, as in the case of the Heavenly Ladder icon and the image of Moses and the burning bush in the Smyrna Physiologus. The second example of a scribe-illuminator is an anonymous twelfth-century figure linked to three manuscripts: Sinai MS. gr. 418 (Climacus's Heavenly Ladder);73 Paris, BnF, MS. gr. 550 (Gregory of Nazianzus); 73.

Z 57 (Homilies of Basil of Caesarea).74 Weitzmann has pointed out that the Climacus manuscript at Sinai introduces stylistic peculiarities recalling Arabic and Coptic ornament that are lacking from the earlier Gregory manuscript in Paris.75 This suggests the possibility of an itinerant artist shuttling between Constantinople, the Holy Land, and Sinai. This scribe painter not only exemplifies the trend to pictorialize texts, he also represents prayer being directed toward portable icons. The miniature illustrating chapter twenty eight of Climacus's treatise depicts monks praying before icons of the Virgin and Christ (fig. 12). The text describes prayer as "living with (synousia) and union (henösis) with God," the "mother of tears," and "the radiance iphötismos) of the mind."76 The miniature prefacing this chapter depicts prayer as an interaction with icons, thus formulating a new understanding of the text that responds to new ritual practices. The stark landscape of Sinai inspired a series of theophanies recorded in texts. This written record— commencing with Exodus and continuing with Gregory of Nyssa, John Climacus, and Anastasios of Sinai— prompted readers to recognize the metaphysical in the phenomenal change of the granite mountains from darkness to radiance, from silence to thundering sound. Anastasios further explains how matter, upon receiving the Holy Spirit, acquires the outer appearance of the very splendor that marks the divine. He grouped together red earth made incandescent by light, Christ as an icon of God, the human soul, and Adam imbued with divine breath. All of these luminous bodies manifest the presence of the Holy Spirit through their phenomenal radiance (periaugë or phötaugeia). Yet along with the non-mimetic icon mapped in the landscape, we see the anthropomorphosis of the mountain in the sixth century apse mosaic at the monastery (fig. 3), which manifests the Christian God through a direct, face-to face encounter with the transfigured Christ. Similarly, the chrysography used in the seventh-century icon of the prophet Elijah also visualizes a radiant body (fig. 4). Both mosaic and gold employ phenomenal radiance to enact the epiphanic. The flatness of their surfaces operates 74. D'Aiuto (see note 71), pp. 7-25. 75. Weitzmann and Calavaris (see note 45), pp. 161-162. 76. Scala Paradisi (see note 56), vol. 2, pp. 268-269.

In the twelfth century we witness a subsequent translation of Sinai's epiphanic radiance in portable icons with burnished gold haloes. Radiant yet two dimensional, they function as "spiritual tablets" channeling prayer. Where and how this process of linking prayer to portable panels unfolded is difficult to pin down. The monastic scriptoria of Constantinople in the second half of the eleventh century offer a plausible center. Representative of this process were artist-scribes, who in their double role were capable of conveying the subtleties of the text with a corresponding pictorial eloquence and innovative compositions. The mid-twelfth-century Heavenly Ladder from Sinai (Sinai MS. gr. 418) suggests the possibility of travelling artist scribes working in Constantinople and elsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean (fig. 12). While we do not have</page><page sequence="18">Pentcheva: The aesthetics of landscape and icon at Sinai 211 further evidence, it may well have been artists like this illuminator who began the process of distilling Sinai's topographic piety from texts and manuscripts into icons, and rendering the theophanic radiance (periaugê) into burnished gold haloes. Ultimately, the surviving material resists the modern pursuit to establish secure provenance; instead it shows a desire outside of Sinai (especially in Constantinople) to pictorialize texts that were written at and intimately connected with Sinai. At the end of this process of translation from text to image, the portable icon depicting figures or scenes related to Sinai's topographic piety emerged. The distinct group of icons with burnished gold haloes now in the monastery's collection manifest how the holy mountain and its stark landscape lived in the Orthodox imagination of the Eastern Mediterranean, transforming the theophanic landscape into radiant burnished metal. And perhaps rather than a range of dates from the late tenth to the early thirteenth century, we should posit that the icons of St. Nicholas (fig. 5), the Miracle of Chonai, the Virgin with Prophets (fig. 6), the Annunciation, the Heavenly Ladder (fig. 7), and the iconostasis beam all date to the second half of the twelfth century.</page></plain_text>
