<plain_text><page sequence="1">Théologie de l'image de Dieu chez Origine. By Henri Crouzel. Pp. 288. (Coll. Théologie, vol. 34.) Paris: Aubier, 1956. 1,200 Fr. Fr. Crouzel begins with the frank acknowledgement that the whole of Origen's thought'has a double origin, Hellenistic and Scriptural' (p. 33); despite the contradictory statement a few pages later that 'Scripture alone serves as the starting-point and support of his thought' (p. 46), it is this view of the double origin which the book as a whole proves, and, although Fr. Crouzel does not appear to realize it, it is the Hellenistic source which, on his showing, has contributed most of the content of Origen's doctrine of the Image of God. The preliminary chapter deals with the history of the concept of the Image of God. After dealing concisely with the Hellenistic tradition, the author turns to the Jewish tradition, and here, naturally, his starting point is Genesis i. 26-27. He is correct in stating that selem (image) 'has a very concrete meaning', and he rightly criticizes Humbert and Kôhler who would exclude from this word any reference to the spiritual side of man, for this, he says, 'introduces a distinction which is foreign to the Hebrew mentality' (p. 46). He himself proceeds then to draw a distinc tion between selem and demut (likeness) which is itself un-Hebraic. He says that the juxtaposition of these two terms is not a case of Hebrew 1 The point is argued in my Origen, contra Celsum, p. 512.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 327 parallelism, for demut 'sometimes has an abstract meaning' (p. 47), which selem does not have. He does not say what this abstract meaning is, nor does he give any O.T. references where it occurs with an abstract meaning. Brown, Driver, and Briggs, who list all the occurrences of the word, do not mention any with an abstract meaning ; demut is simply parallel to, or a synonym of, selem. Having drawn a distinction between the two, Crouzel asserts that the second phrase, 'after our likeness', reduces the anthropomorphic element in the phrase 'in our image'. If his distinction were valid—he cites no authorities who support it—this might be true; but it remains difficult to see how the words 'in our image' can be interpreted as an anthropomorphism. They do not imply an anthropomorphic view of God, but rather a theomorphic view of man. The Targums, which seek to remove anthropomorphisms from the O.T., allow the two phrases to stand in simple parallelism. It is possible, perhaps, that the LXX translation κατ' εΙκόνα ήμετεραν καϊ καθ' όμοίωσιν gives some ground for such a distinction as that which Crouzel draws, the καθ' όμοίωσι,ν reducing the force of the κατ' εικόνα, but it is a mistake to read back into the Hebrew text a distinction supported by the LXX. One wonders whether Crouzel's distinction is motivated by the unconscious desire to make Origen's thought appear to be more firmly based on Scripture than it is in fact. The book falls naturally into two parts, the first dealing with the Image-concept as applied to Christ, and the second with the participa tion of man in the Image of God. The first part is an excellent treatment of Origen's Christology, showing how the Image-concept was par ticularly congenial to Origen's emphasis on the pre-existent Logos at the expense of the Incarnate Lord. His fondness for the Image-concept sharpens the subordinationism from which he never manages to escape. The second part deals at length with Origen's anthropology, with the question of the seat and content of the Image of God in man, the effect of sin upon it, and the restoration of the Image by Christ. Prominent in this discussion is Origen's distinction between the Image and the Likeness, the former being given to man in the beginning, while the latter will be given to man when he is deified at the end. In this connexion Crouzel deals with Origen's doctrine of Grace and Freedom, and with the work of the Holy Spirit. The conclusion of the study is that Origen's concentration on this concept creates Christological difficulties which it cannot solve, and that the later Church tended to pass over the Image-concept (just as it passed over the Logos-concept) because it suggests an inferiority of the Son to the Father. The central concept of later Christological thought was the central Christological concept of the New Testament, that of</page><page sequence="3">328 REVIEWS Sonship ; and it is significant that, as Crouzel himself points out (p. 59), the fourth gospel, the N.T. writing in which Christology is most fully developed, while emphasizing the revelational role of the Son of God, ignores the Image-concept. 'The Image appeared to John as insufficient to express the community of the two Persons. Christ is not only ΐΐκών, he is Qeos, God.' Because of its double source, there is a tension in Origen's thought between that which he has derived from Scripture and that which has come to him from current philosophy ; the philosophical framework in which he sets his doctrine prevents the biblical elements from making themselves decisively felt, and when they are introduced into an alien setting, they appear in flat contradiction to the elements derived from philosophy. That this is true is abundantly illustrated in Crouzel's discussion. T. E. Pollard T. Ε. Pollard</page></plain_text>
