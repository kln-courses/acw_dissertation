That this Ford car might stand in front of the Bon Ton Store, Hannibal invaded Rome and Erasmus wrote in Oxford cloisters. -Sinclair Lewis, Main Street (1920) In 1915 Charles Russell, the self-proclaimed cowboy artist, made one of his greatest works, When Shadows Hint Death (fron- tispiece). The painting shows two white men warily watching the shadows, projected upon an adjacent cliff, of seven or eight figures recognizable by their headdresses as Indians. The actual Indians, the ones making the shadows, presumably ride along the top of the cliff, outside the picture, above the two men. The setting sun projects the Indians' shadows against the facing cliff. The white men quiet their horses while watching the shadows for a sign that their position has been discovered. When Shadows Hint Death is a compel- ling painting in part because of its immediacy. It seems like a slice of real life. Indeed, the painting shows a perilous possible confrontation of the kind cattlemen knew and feared.

A man meeting such a party runs great risk of losing his horse, his rifle, and all else he has. This has happneed quite frequently during the past few years to hunters or cowboys who have wandered into the debatable territory where our country borders on the Indian lands. "The story was no doubt one Russell had heard around some campfire," writes Peter Hassrick, crediting the view that this painting, like other works by Russell, refers primarily to an actual scene. 1 Certainly Russell himself thought of his paintings as accurate. Unlike his counterparts Frederic Remington and Charles Schreyvogel, both of whom lived in the East, Russell (1864-1926) had gone west as a teenager, worked as a cowboy for eleven years, and lived in the West (specifically Montana) ever since. His claim to having been there-to having experienced all that he showed- gave his work then, as it does now, a powerful aura of immediacy and accuracy. So did his philosophy of art. The western painter Maynard Dixon remembered about Russell: "Natural fact and historical accuracy were his aims; imagination, interpretation,-a recreation of the subject matter-to him were nonsense. .. I just try to tell the truth [Russell said] about what I know."2 The sight of Russell sitting dourly in his log cabin studio is almost enough to confirm this sense of the hard-bitten, truth-telling cowboy artist (fig. 1). His literalist history differed from that of others also preoccupied in those same years with preserving the past. "To snatch," wrote Joseph Conrad in 1897, "in a moment of courage, from the remorseless rush of time a passing phase of life, is only the beginning of the task,"3 but for Russell it seems to have been the conclusion. What, then, should we make of When Shadows Hint Death, a painting that in part abandons the literalism Russell so prized? To be sure, it features much of Russell's trademark accuracy, as testified by his detailed depiction of the clothing and saddles. Russell's comments about the painting suggest little beyond its literal- ism. "When shaddoes hint death[.] Up agenst it" is all he wrote to Joe DeYong, the deaf apprentice to whose inquiries he would scribble replies.4 Yet the shadows projected on the facing cliff are anything but naturalistic. They are too clear and precise, given the void across which they appear. They are also unnaturally monumental. We could conclude that Russell was deliberately departing from facts-what accomplished artist would not have enhanced the size and clarity of those shadowy warriors, after all?-and that he therefore paradoxically used the kind of poetic license he professed to hate. True enough. But concluding this, and only this, would be a little like trapping a prairie chicken in a bear trap. There's more out there. This article takes as a truism the unremarkable idea that the present is the unavoidable condition of knowledge about the past. This idea applies as much to Russell as to this article itself. Further, this article assumes that Russell's present was not some extratextual reality-not "some brute facticity made of sterner and solider stuff than signs"5-but was itself heavily mediated and constructed by representa- tion. The shadowy Indians in Russell's painting, we will see, establish a series of complex metaphors that lead us to the time and place of the picture's making. Although Russell himself never would have intended it this way (indeed, he would be surprised by much of what I will say), what lives in When Shadows Hint Death is not the Old West but the 72 Winter 1994</page><page sequence="4">Photographer unknown, Charles Russell in his studio, Great Falls, 1914. C. M. Russell Museum, Great Falls, Montana modern city of Great Falls, Montana, where he lived, and the year 1915. Projections Analysis begins, however, not with the modern world but with the very ancient one. Perhaps the image that Russell's painting recalls most clearly is Plato's allegory of the cave. Indeed this reference, pointed out by another art historian, J. Gray Sweeney, is cohesive enough to make it difficult to believe that Russell, for all his professed ignorance of high culture, was not aware of the allegory. As in Plato's story, immobilized figures facing in one direction-the two cow- boys-stare at the projected shadows of things passing above and behind them. These shadowy figures, moreover, emerge from the cliff's shadow, a horizontal "wall" exactly recalling Plato's cave with its "low wall. . . like the screen at a puppet show in front of the performers who show their puppets above it." Staring at the images, the cowboys read as versions of Plato's slaves, able to see representations but unable to see the truth. "Do you not think," asks Socrates, "that they would consider these shadows to be the real things?"'6 Russell knew people who were acquainted only with images of Indians, namely his eastern patrons. Remington said that some "well-bred" easterners "take my pictures for veritable happenings and speculate on what will happen next to the puppets," and Russell may have felt the same way about his urban patrons. When Shadows Hint Death was shown at Pittsburgh's Wunderly Galleries, 3-16 March 1916, as part of Russell's traveling "West That Has Passed" exhibition. It was purchased by a Pittsburgh business- man and hangs today in the Duquesne Club, a Pittsburgh men's club, where viewers of the painting duplicate the activity of the cowboys-watching images and images only. In 1919 Russell told an interviewer that "Pittsburghers most of all" purchased his paintings. "They may 73 American Art</page><page sequence="5">2 Photographer unknown, Charles and Nancy Russell with Douglas Fairbanks, in costume as D'Artagnon in The Three Musketeers, 1921. Taylor Museum for Southwestern Studies, Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, Helen E. and Homer E. Britzman Collection not be so strong on art," he went on, "but they are real men and like real life."'7 Maybe so, but Russell's words sound ironic. When it came to the West, he understood that his eastern patrons knew not "real life" but only images. There is, however, a more compelling way to understand the painting's pro- jected shadows. By 1915 the Western movie was a well-established genre. In 1910 alone more than two hundred Westerns were made. D. W. Griffith's studio, Biograph, had produced seventy- four Westerns between 1908 and 1912. In 1913 the biggest Western ever made to that point premiered--Buffalo Bill's The Indian Wars Refought, featuring some of the participants in the actual battles.8 Great Falls, where Russell lived, had four movie theaters-the Alcazar, Gem, Imperial, and Sexton-that offered daily- changing schedules of Westerns as well as the latest movies featuring Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and many other stars. In Great Falls, Russell was a fan of Westerns. "Charley would recount in detail and at full length, it seemed to me, a recent movie in which Mary Pickford or Douglas Fairbanks had leading roles," remembered Wilda Linderman, who had known Russell when she was growing up. "He genuinely enjoyed the dramas which he recounted from the screen." Russell was such a fan, in fact, that by 1920, when his career was well established, he and his wife Nancy began wintering in Hollywood. There he enthusiastically attended filmings like the one he de- scribed to his friend Frank Brown in 1926: This is the bigest moovie camp in the world[.] thair are more two gun men here now than in the history of the west from north to south ever knew[.] I was at a studio the other day[.] they are making a dance hall seen ....

Russell's friends and patrons included the famous cowboy actors William S. Hart and Harry Carey, as well as Pickford and Fairbanks, her husband (fig. 2). "I have seen you under many names and you have worn them all well-an actor of action always," Russell wrote to Fairbanks.9 Given Russell's interests, When Shadows Hint Death is in fact a remarkably cinematic painting. It shows images projected upon a flat surface-projected in an unnaturally focused way across the many hundreds of yards separating the adjacent cliffs. Framed between the distant cliff top and the near cliff's parallel line of shadow, the Indians appear upon a suggestively rectangular "screen." Indeed, this "screen" works much like the cave wall in Plato's allegory of projected images, which, as Jean-Louis Baudry has noted, is a remarkable adumbration of movie projection: "Isn't it curious that Plato, in order.., to demonstrate, reveal, and make understood what sort of illusion underlies our direct contact with the real, would imagine or resort to an apparatus that doesn't merely evoke but quite precisely describes in its mode of opera- tion the cinematographic apparatus and the spectator's place in relation to it[?]'"10 Below the means of projection, as in a movie theater, the cowboys watch the projected action. What they watch, the savage on the warpath, was already a filmic convention at this time: one need only see a movie such as Griffith's Battle ofElderbush Gulch (1913), with its rampaging redskins, to realize this point. More than it may recall Russell's actual frontier experiences, Shadows almost certainly, though inadvertently, recalls a more recent part of his life-namely, his movie watching. The movie reference, we will see, is the key to understanding the ideology embodied in Russell's painting. Particu- larly telling are the picture's "viewers"- the two cowboys. They do not simply Although Russell was a fan of Westerns, he could not have helped but realize that such movies superseded his own pic- tures in drama, action, and, above all, in lifelikeness. watch the scene; they do so with some trepidation. Although Russell was a fan of Westerns, he could not have helped but realize that such movies superseded his own pictures in drama, action, and, above all, in lifelikeness. "Historically Correct!" and "Historically Accurate!" ran Great Falls Tribune advertisements for movies playing in Great Falls in 1915. No matter how wrong Hollywood actors got it, they portrayed the Old West in a medium more compellingly realistic than Russell's: they moved. Accordingly, the cowboys in Shadows can be read as fearing the intrusion not so much of Indians but of images that move. Indeed the picture makes much of the contrast between the Indians' movement and the cowboys' stillness. The nearest cowboy is twice echoed in the anthropomorphic rock outcroppings to the right-once in the shaded vertical rectangle replete with a "head" cocked at an angle identical to the cowboy's own (fig. 3), and again in the distinct face, just to the shaded rectangle's left, whose jagged geometric nose exactly copies the cowboy's. Like the rock, the cowboys' stillness is stony, frozen, and absolute compared to the flitting images they watch. Presaged in the shadows is the 75 American Art</page><page sequence="7">4 The Fireboat, 1918. Oil on board, 39.4 x 62.2 cm (15 x2 X 24 I2 in.). C. M. Russell Museum, Great Falls, Montana death of painting. In 1915, Russell knew a gulf had indeed opened between painted and filmed representation. Tokens of the Old and New Shadows is one of a number of works in which Russell juxtaposed adversaries, tokens of the old and the new, the traditional and the technological, in a mannered relation of near and far. In The Fireboat, for example, a group of warriors ponders the advent of a steamboat on the river far below (fig. 4). Always in these paintings the newer of the adversaries- the one representing technological change and the end of the old days-appears in the background. In 1924 Ralph Budd, president of the Great Northern Railway, asked Russell for a painting that would include a locomotive in the foreground. Nancy Russell, her husband's agent, responded in no uncertain terms: I will tell you a few things he cannot do- First: draw a close-up of any part of a modern train. Second: He cannot draw a pretty girl or people in up-to-date clothing. But he does know and feel the romance of the West ofyesterday and knows its people as well as its animals, their lives and the magic that held them here. So anything he might undertake would necessarily be from their side-that is, the old West would be in the foreground with civilization coming to take its place in the changing of this frontier.11 Russell's shadowy Indians, subliminally evoking the movie projector, are as much tokens of the new as the railroad itself. Russell could no sooner have foregrounded those shadows than Ralph Budd's train. The second of Nancy Russell's stipula- tions-the one about a "pretty girl"- indicates that the near-far formula applied not just to technological tokens of the new but to gendered ones as well. It also applied to racial and ethnic tokens. In 1899 Russell painted The Hold Up, an image of an actual historical scene, the robbery of the Deadwood Stage by the outlaw Big Nose George (fig. 5). Big Nose George, training his gun in the foreground, is certainly a villain. He is dirty and unkempt; he is related tonally to 76 Winter 1994</page><page sequence="8">the blasted trees; and his big nose is unceremoniously displayed. Yet we would be missing the point if we saw him just as a villain. He is really much more of a hero. He stands straight and firm, a romantic figure backed by his white horse. He is firmly and boldly modeled, unlike his caricatured victims. Russell himself confirmed the sense of the stage robber as hero. "We had out- laws," he told an interviewer about the West of the 1880s, "but [these robbers] were big like the country they lived in." Owen Wister felt the same way. Noting that the "peculiar independence" of cowboys had become "dimmed," Wister wrote in 1895, "The only man who has retained that wholly is the outlaw, the horse and cattle thief, on whose grim face hostility to progress forever sits." Along these lines, Hassrick has likened The Hold Up to Brandywine School illustrations of Sherwood Forest robbers and South Seas pirates "living by a code of bravado and greed."12 Big Nose George is thus an emblem of an older and heroic way of life. The stagecoach passengers, in the place Russell allotted for approaching civiliza- tion, correspondingly represent the coming of the new. With the possible exceptions of the prospector and gambler, they are people Russell would have considered new-style westerners-those flooding in to settle and civilize the land. Russell clearly delighted in painting these newcomers as stereotypes. They allowed him manifold opportunities, all in one painting, to exercise his consider- able skill at caricature. The young woman is the pretty and modern kind Nancy Russell was to specify in her letter to Ralph Budd. Two other passengers are singled out, however, for the roughest treatment. To the Chinese man falls the ignominious distinction of having a six- gun pressed against his jaw. To the far right, separated from his fellow passengers and realizing that he is indeed next in line to be robbed, is a Jewish man. According to accounts of the robbery, one of the victims was a Mr. Isaac Katz, who had come to Montana from New York City to open a clothing store.'3 In Russell's painting, this figure commands special attention. His hands are raised not only in surrender but in melodramatic exaspera- tion. He knows, as do we, that his gold watch fob is about to be ripped off. And if we think of the stereotype, prevalent in Russell's time, that Jews were themselves the robbers, the rip-off artists, we can understand still further why Big Nose George and his cohorts, robbing from the rich if not necessarily giving to the poor, were something like denizens of a western Sherwood Forest. The figure of the Jewish man is singled out in another way. He occupies a very specific spot in Russell's stagelike space- not just in the background but close to the canvas's right edge. While Russell customarily placed the threat of the new in the background, as we have seen, he sometimes reserved this one spot for especially ominous threats. In Russell's great late painting Whose Meat? a bear stands up to claim the hunter's fallen ram (fig. 6). Russell often showed bears in positions that most suggest their human qualities. Among many examples, one thinks of When Ignorance Is Bliss (1907, private collection), in which a camping cowboy sleeps as a bear stands over him and drinks from a whiskey bottle it holds between its paws. The bear of Whose Meat? is humanlike not just because it stands. It occupies roughly the same spot as The Hold Up's passengers and quite specifically the spot reserved for the Jewish man (fig. 7). The paintings, widely different though they are, relate in many ways. Both Whose Meat? and The Hold Up feature a contest between opposing parties for objects strewn on the intervening ground: the dead ram is no less valuable to the hunter than purse and strongbox are to Big Nose George. Obviously Russell meant no connection between the 77 American Art</page><page sequence="9">5 The Hold Up, 1899. Oil on canvas, 77.2 x 122.6 cm (30 3A/ x 48 'A in.). Amon Carter Museum of Art, Fort Worth, Texas two paintings. Yet clearly the latter painting, despite itself, evokes the earlier one in quite specific ways. The bear (fig. 8) is the ursine cousin of the Jewish man, the ghost, or trace, of the earlier human figure. This unconscious "ghosting" animates all works of art, yet it may be an especially strong feature of Russell's work. Norma Linderman Waller, Wilda Linderman's sister, was among many who witnessed Russell's famous trick of deftly modeling a small clay or wax figure in his pocket. She remembered: I would see Mr. Russell pull one of his wee wax figures from his pocket. He would set a tiny pig with curly tail on the arm of his chair... and just as I was about to say "May I have it?" his deft fingers would flatten it out and drop it back into his pocket, to come out next as a cocky rooster, feathers and all. I never heard of anyone else who could do this.'4 Just as Russell magically transformed his wax and clay sculptures from one being into another, the rooster containing the ghost of the creature it had just been, so the bear in Whose Meat? is a remodel- ing of the Jewish man. (Indeed, that one of the robbers reaches into the Chinese man's pocket suggests that, on an unconscious level, Russell was willing to thematize his pocket remodeling in The Hold Up itself.) Ultimately, the connection between the bear and the figure of the Jewish man allows us to understand the stereotyped Jew all the more as a threatening newcomer. The shadowy Indians of When Shadows Hint Death constitute still another of Russell's adversarial lineups. Here they read as statements of the new technology. 78 Winter 1994</page><page sequence="10">6 Whose Meat? 1914. Oil on canvas, 78.1 x 123.5 cm (30 /s x 48 % in.).

Thomas Gilcrease Institute of American History and Arts, Tulsa, Oklahoma Yet, while they augur a filmed future, they also imply a racial past-the old seen in terms of the new. As in other Russell paintings, the Indians are signs of an earlier America. In the manifest narrative, they ride against the light of a setting sun. Many paintings of Russell's era associate Indians with setting suns and other signs of their imminent disappearance. Remington's Outlier (1909, Brooklyn Museum), an image of a lone brave next to a setting sun, is one example. Similarly, Russell's figures are seen as shadows, a metaphor linking them to other expres- sions by white artists of a race growing more evanescent, closer to extinction, with every moment. In Remington's With the Eye of the Mind (1908, Thomas Gilcrease Institute of Art and History, Tulsa), for example, three braves watch a cloudy warrior as diaphanous as Russell's Indians. Still further, Russell's Indians are not just once but twice on a cliff: they ride upon the cliff above the cowboys, and they are projected on the adjacent cliff. Western paintings tend to show the doomed Indian not only by the light of a setting sun but also on a cliff, literally standing at the edge.'5 Finally, the unconscious reference to movie-making corroborates Shadow's death imagery. Like the setting sun, the movie projector's light is an expiring sort-a light that flickers as though it were itself the immolating memento mori of what it shows. In one sense Shadows depicts a generic death, that of a heroic, preindustrial past for which Indians were a metaphor. Russell's painting comes from the time of the buffalo nickel, when Indians became Like the setting sun, the movie projector's light is an expiring sort-a light that flickers as though it were itself the immo- lating memento morn of what it shows. synonymous with things American. Russell's Indians move across the cliff in a Parthenon-like frieze; they are noble savages, a heroic procession of defiant, erect warriors that relates to other Ameri- can imagery from the time, such as Alexander Phimister Proctor's War Chief (fig. 9). In 1909 a friend of Remington's suggested that he design a monumental sculpture of an Indian for New York Harbor-a work the friend described as "the one necessary statue of the whole country."''6 At the turn of the century, the image of Indians became a national symbol representing the set of mythic American values-pride, defiance, freedom-in whose name actual Indian cultures had been decimated. More literally, however, it is the Indians themselves whose deaths are hinted at in Russell's painting. With its story of the old replaced by the new, Shadows is one of many images from the 80 Winter 1994</page><page sequence="12">10 Photographer unknown, Great Falls Smelter from railroad grade, Great Falls, Montana, 1903.

Primitive peoples would disappear before the inexorable advance of civilization. Progressions Such a theory, given form in hundreds of Russell images, functioned in a very specific way in the modernizing city of Great Falls, Montana, where Russell lived during much of his career. Russell made When Shadows Hint Death in his log cabin studio, yet the studio's rusticity, especially as it comes across in that highly constructed photograph (see fig. 1), belied the fact that Great Falls was hardly a backwoods community. It had been founded in 1882 by Paris Gibson and James J. Hill on the Great Falls of the Missouri, a site noted by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on their explo- ration of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803- 1806. It was not the falls' historical resonance but their economic potential, however, that attracted Gibson and Hill. The industrial power afforded by the falls, they felt, could create an industrial metropolis-the future "Minneapolis of Montana," as Great Falls came to be called. As Will Hanks, editor of the Great Falls Tribune, wrote in 1885: "The water power of the Great Falls is practically unlimited, while near to it on the line of the railroad to the mines lie inexhaustible supplies of coking coal, iron, and lime.17 By 1890 Great Falls had a silver smelter employing three hundred men (fig. 10). That year a copper smelter was also established. Large government purchases of silver, as well as a dramatically increased 81 American Art</page><page sequence="13">13 The Big Stack Is Our Landmark, 1908.

Montana Historical Society, Helena, Great Falls Elks Club Collection demand for copper (to meet the rapid, nationwide expansion of electric power), made the 1890s a boom time in Great Falls. By 1892 the population had grown to ten thousand. Without doubt the town's icon was the stack of the Boston and Montana smelter, especially after 1908, when the original smokestack was replaced by one 506 feet high (fig. 11). Into this bustling city stepped Charlie Russell, the cowboy artist. Russell and his wife moved to Great Falls in 1897, a year after they were married. They had been living in the outlying town of Cascade, but, as Hassrick writes, "they agreed that Cascade promised little in the way of art sales." Russell said that "he lived for yesterday"; the conventional view indeed is that he rejected the modern world or at least regarded it as a necessary though loathsome inconvenience. Yet in 1900 he and Nancy built a home on Great Falls's Fourth Avenue North, in the most affluent part of town (fig. 12). They lived in this house until Russell's death in 1926. His log cabin studio was just next to the house. Within the rusticity of that studio Russell could hear automobiles drive by on Fourth Avenue North. Above it floated the smoke issuing from the gigantic smelter, not a mile distant. "I was very sorry to here [sic] of the smelter closing," he wrote to a friend during hard economic times in 1903.18 Despite his professed love of the past, a drawing Russell made in 1908 shows his endorse- ment of the modern Great Falls (fig. 13). If Russell was hardly an outsider in Great Falls, neither was his art. With its acceptance, however begrudging, of the evolutionary doctrine of technological progress, his work fit right in. Russell's extreme popularity in Great Falls indi- cates that his love of the past meshed well with the city's future aspirations.19 This melding of old and new is especially explicit in a pen-and-ink drawing called The Last ofHis Race (fig. 14). Created in 1899, the drawing sets the old-and-new theme in Great Falls itself. An elderly Indian man kneels and leans for support on a stick, while a woman on a bicycle rides by. In the distance, across the Missouri, in the adversarial position of the new, is Great Falls, replete with its iconic smokestack.

Russell Museum, Great Falls, Montana barely visible in the reproduction, ghostly warriors hunt ghostly buffalo. The Indian is surrounded by a spate of death signs- the barbed-wire fence, telegraph poles, road, and obligatory buffalo skull. Even the peace pipe suggests the reversed torch of extinguished genius; its smoke or flame has been supplanted by that of the new "pipe" toward which it points in the distance. Further, the Indian's stick echoes this distant stack, implying a metaphor wherein he sinkingly leans upon, in a vaguely martyrlike way, the mighty icon of progress. The woman, a variant on the female newcomers of The Hold Up, is no less an emblem of progress. She is as much a sign of the land's domestication as barbed wire or telegraph poles. She is also related to the allegorical figures of civilization that are typically female in depictions of westward expansion, such as John Gast's famous American Progress (1872, Gene Autry Museum, Los Angeles). She is indeed, as the drawing suggests, an "outskirt" of civilization. The feeble Indian, however, was no fantasy. Russell's drawing shows a scene any resident of Great Falls would have instantly recognized. In the 1890s in Montana, homeless Cree, Chippewa, and Metis (people of French-Indian descent) went "from town to town and reservation to reservation, looking primarily for food ... and their own home."20 The Cree and Metis had been followers of Louis Riel, the French-Indian leader of a rebellion against the Canadian government. When Riel was captured and hung, the Cree and Metis drifted into Montana, where they joined the Chippewa, for whom the state's reserva- tion system had no room. These homeless people soon became ubiquitous sights outside many Montana towns. Around Great Falls they lived in the surrounding hills shown in Russell's picture. 83 American Art</page><page sequence="15">15 Buffalo Bill's Duel with Yellowhand, 1917. Oil on canvas, 70.8 x 121.6 cm (27 7/ x 47 7/ in.). Sid Richardson Collection of Western Art, Fort Worth, Texas The town's residents often treated these homeless Indians and part-Indians with derision. In the late 1920s Art Hinck, a local pickle salesman, used to picnic on the hills surrounding Great Falls. On one of these hills he decided to construct a giant "57" of white-washed sandstone to advertise his company, Heinz 57.21 Sensing that "57 varieties" aptly summarized the mixed races then still encamped above the city (as they still do), the residents began to call them "Hill 57 Indians." Indians such as the one in Russell's drawing became retroactively known by this name. In Russell's own day, many Montana citizens advocated forcible removal of the Indians. In 1896 they pressured Congress into allocating $5,000 for the army under Lt. John J. ("Black Jack") Pershing, future World War I hero, to deport the Indians to Canada. The deportation failed. Finally, in 1917, two years after he painted When Shadows Hint Death, Russell and several other important citizens helped establish the Rocky Boy's Reservation just below Havre, Montana, about one hundred miles north of Great Falls. Russell, who had never advocated violent removal and who was much more sympathetic to the Indians' plight than most of the city's residents, found his fellow citizens' apathy toward the Indians hypocritical: It doesn't look good for the people ofMon- tana that they will sit and see a lot of [Indian] women and children starve to death in this kind of weather.... [The white residents] would be the first to yell iftheir grub pile was running short and they didn't have enough coal to keep out the cold.22 84 Winter 1994</page><page sequence="16">Yet what everyone wanted, including Russell, was the removal, in one way or another, of what had become an embar- rassment to a place like Great Falls-a place trying so self-consciously to be a model modern city, clean and proud. Towns like Great Falls were the kind of place Sinclair Lewis satirized in Main Street (1920), his virtually contemporane- ous novel of a Minnesota prairie town. The irony is clear in the novel's claim that a "Ford car.., in front of the Bon Ton Store" was "the climax of civilization."23 Hundreds of destitute Indians begging for meat at the Great Falls meat plant could hardly have been what Paris Gibson had in mind when he envisioned his town as the future Minneapolis of Montana. Russell's art contributed to the senti- ment for removal. In places like the Mint Saloon, where his paintings were dis- played wall to wall, he saturated Great Falls with seemingly objective statements of a doomed race, statements that natural- ized the idea that the Indians gathered on what would come to be known as Hill 57 were shadowy holdovers from an earlier evolutionary stage, pitiably doomed by progress. Obviously Russell did not work in a conspiratorial way. On the contrary, he painted things "truthfully"-that is, according to the evolutionary model by which he and his contemporaries under- stood history. The model allowed for heartfelt sympathy, to be sure; yet it also accommodated, even made way for, progress. Russell hastened and sizably profited by the racial doom he mourned. In this respect his antimodernism was no different from the accommodating nostalgia of many Americans at the time.24 His sympathy was distinctly progressive. Perhaps the ultimate, though oblique, statement of Russell's modern civic pride is When Shadows Hint Death itself, where two white men look fearfully upon shadowy Indians on an adjacent cliff. To live, in one's daily life, beneath the shadow of vagabonds-this is perhaps what Russell, the proud city dweller, did not want to look upon. Frozen Images One thing Russell did want to look upon, however, was images. When Shadows Hint Death tells us this much through its focus on looking, especially on looking as a political act. Like his cowboys, like his patrons, Russell based his sense of the real West upon images. Never was this reliance stronger than during the years he made Shadows, when his experience on the actual frontier was some twenty years old. As Brian W.

He clipped reproductions of paintings by Eastman Johnson and Howard Pyle. In London for the popular British showing of "The West That Has Passed" in 1914, he saw and humorously commented on modernist art at the Tate Gallery.25 He went to the movies. This was a man keenly interested in images. In Shadows there are only images; the "real" Indians cannot be seen. The painting encapsulates Russell's fascination with examining images. This fascination was not just aesthetic but political. In 1917 Russell painted Buffalo Bill's Duel with Yellowhand, a tribute to William F.

It depicts an event from 1876: the young Cody has just shot down the famous warrior Yellowhand, retributively taking There in the snow, Big Foot was most assuredly vulnerable to what gunned him down; but so, too, was he vulnerable to that second shot-that of the photographer. the first scalp for Custer-that is, killing the first Indian after Custer himself had been killed. Racial violence partly estab- lishes the painting's politics. Not only has Yellowhand been killed but, according to the story, he will be scalped, too, "a grisly sequel implied by the knife riding promi- nently on Cody's hip."26 Yellowhand, in the adversary's spot, also intertextually resembles the Jew in The Hold Up and the bear of Whose Meat? Moreover, his death fall will cast him into a bone-strewn gully-an evaporated watercourse sugges- tive at once of the grave and of extinction in a broader sense: Yellowhand's dust will mix in the dust of the ages. The implication, should we choose to read it so, is thus of an evaporation more sweep- ing than Yellowhand's alone: as he falls, so do all Indians drop into the evolutionary trough. But none of this explains the most curious part of the image-the strangely parallel placement of Yellowhand's arms. We know from other paintings that Russell borrowed from photographs of Wounded Knee. These grisly images became his paradigm, it appears, for all dead and dying Indians. For example, art historian Rick Stewart points out that the dead Indian at lower left in Russell's A Desperate Stand (1898, Amon Carter Museum, Fort Worth) has gone into rigor mortis far too quickly, given the stage of the fight, and that this departure from realism suggests Russell's familiarity with photographs of the frozen Sioux at Wounded Knee.27 Buffalo Bill's Duel with Yellowhand evinces the same knowledge. 86 Winter 1994</page><page sequence="18">17 "Keep America Beautiful" advertisement 18 Man Ray, Larmes (Glass Tears), ca. 1930-33. Silver print I- The parallel placement of Yellowhand's arms finds its source in a Wounded Knee photograph that Russell owned of the dead Sioux chief Big Foot (fig. 16). The appropriation helps to freeze Yellowhand in a stark and memorable attitude of death. But it does something else as well. There in the snow, Big Foot was most assuredly vulnerable to what gunned him down; but so, too, was he vulnerable to that second shot-that of the photogra- pher. Buffalo Bill's Duel with Yellowhand testifies to the vast quantity of Indian photographs and imagery Russell could draw upon, a quantity that in itself indicated power over the Indians- namely, the power of massively institu- tionalized ethnographic information. In its theme of the act of looking- and looking, particularly, at Indian images- When Shadows Hint Death comments upon Russell's situation in Great Falls in 1915. As long as the cowboys see-and are not themselves seen-they are in control; as long as the Indians remain only objects and not subjects of vision, promiscuously surrendering themselves to be seen, they lack command. Russell's painting explic- itly links vision and power. It is a picture about the politics of representation.28 Russell's views on race are not simply inherent, however, in his statements and art. They are also, of course, a function of the historian's own attitudes. Like Russell and like his cowboys-indeed like Plato's slaves themselves-the historian is also an examiner of images. Probably the first Indian image I ever saw was the focus of a series of television and magazine adver- tisements in the early 1970s asking Americans not to litter (fig. 17). In many ways these "Keep America Beautiful" advertisements are the modern descendants of Russell's paintings. Like his images of sad but stoic Indians contemplating the cruel advent of civiliza- tion, Madison Avenue's noble savage stares at an icon of progress, even if that icon is no longer a train, boat, or smoke- stack but (as I remember) a discarded fast-food sack.

He cries on the road's shoulder and our own. What's puzzling about this Indian is the tear. So perfectly it hangs, suspended beautifully as a pendulous little drop. The As in Russell's images, the Indian is an affecting symbol for an earlier, preindustrial, and litter- free America.

(Indeed, in the two different "Keep America Beautiful" print advertise- ments I have seen, the tear is identical.) The advertisement thus becomes wonder- fully ironic. The Indian cries at the garbage, but how long, we might ask, would it take for his tear to biodegrade? The Indian's emotion itself, as it is represented, is literally garbage; the advertisement casts emotion not as an outpouring but as an excretion, linked in its perpetual vertical fall less, say, with the mighty "cataract" of Romantic waterfalls than with images of sludge pouring from industrial drains (or smoke from the smelter stack). This is a tear akin to the ones photographed by Man Ray (fig. 18). The Indian in "Keep America Beauti- ful" sheds a progressive tear. It is through such images, with their industrious sympathy, that the contemporary histo- rian constructs Russell. This sort of mediation, however, does not imply that the past in question has been invented. Instead, it suggests that historical under- standing, inasmuch as it is possible, is a matter of invention. That Russell should have helped initiate the very tradition through which we see him only amplifies this understanding. His was the first film of tears.
