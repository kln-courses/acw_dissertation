<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Pillars of Hercules Revisited GARY M. TURNQUIST University of New Mexico Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131 The tenth labor was to bring back the cattle of Geryon who was a monster with three bodies living on Erythia, a western island. On his way there Hercules reached the land at the end of the Mediterranean and set up as a memorial of his journey two great rocks, called the Pillars of Hercules (now Gibralter and Ceuta). Then he got the oxen and took them to Mycenae.' When one is confronted with the question of the location of the Pillars of Hercules, the "description" above is usually recalled. A reference in a dictionary or encyclopedia also tends to adhere to this traditional location; and variations on this myth seem to confine themselves spatially to those two massive rock outcroppings mentioned above. However, there is a striking confusion over this point in historical data; enough so to suggest that the meaning behind the phrase was lost rather early after its conception, and transformed into that symbolically particular world of mythology. It is my intention then, to ask again the question: "Where is the location of the Pillars of Hercules?" In his 1855 book Phoenicia, Kenrick discusses an early dilemma associated with this question. He states: "The Tyrians, they said, being warned by an oracle to send a colony to the Columns of Hercules, despatched a deputation, which landed first of all on the eastern side of the Straits at the place where the colony of the Hexitani subsequently stood, believing that here were the Columns, but returned, the sacrifices being inauspicious. A second deputation passed the straits, and finding an island dedicated to Hercules opposite the town of Onoba (Saltes opposite to Huelva), sacrificed again to the god, in the belief that the Columns were here; but the victims were a second time unfavorable, and they too returned to Tyre. A third deputation fixed upon Gadeira (Gades). Posidonius denounced the story of this oracle, and the consequent deputations, as 'Phoenician figments'. We may more candidly regard them as indicating that there were other Phoenician settlements within and without the Straits, whose date was uncertain."2 Harden, in his 1962 book, The Phoenicians, seems to be aware of this complexity when in a footnote for chapter seven we find: "According to Pomponius Mela, iii,46 (see Gsell IV, 304). Whether the term 'Pillars of Hercules' was the Phoenician as well as the Greek name for the Straits of Gibralter is not known. The Greek version of Hanno uses it, but we do not know what words it was translating. According to Strabo (iii,5,5) the Libyans and Iberians affirmed that the Pillars were not at the straits, but were two bronze stelae with Phoenician inscriptions in the temple of Hercules at Gades."3 The question then, seems to center itself more around the Phoenician occupation of this area as a trading center, than with the Greek conceptions concerning this region. It is significant to note that the major fortified Phoenician trading settlements of Gades, Tingis,/and Lixus were situated along the Atlantic coast, with Gades flanking the Straits to the north in Spain; Lixus, located at about the same distance to the south in Morocco; and Tingis, situated on a bluff overlooking the Straits proper. In considering these three sites, both history and archeology have been consistent in one respect-that all three locations had maintained a major temple dedicated to the Phoenician god Melkarth.4 Melkarth, the tutelary god of Tyre, and who was considered to represent one aspect of Baal, is reviewed by Kenrick: "His name, which denotes 'King of the City,' indicates this peculiar character. Under the slightly altered form of Melicertes, he appears in the Greek mythology with the attributes of a maritime divinity, and the synonym of Palaomon, or the 'Wrestler', an epithet of Hercules."5 An echo in Rawlinson seems to confirm this ancient correlation when he stated: "The Greeks, who identified Baal with their Zeus, viewed Melkarth as corresponding to their Heracles, or Hercules. . ."; his anthropomorphic form seems to have been that of "a huge muscular man, with a lion's skin and sometimes with a club."6 In a footnote for his statement on page 124, Kenrick tried to clarify the Tyrians' confusion, and adds: "I have employed the word Columns in the text in accordance with common usage. But the original rraXu does not necessarily mean a column, but a tablet, erected or sculptured, such as it was customary to employ for recording events, and</page><page sequence="2">14 GARY M.

Columns (cippi), in the stricter sense, were also sometimes employed for this purpose (Strabo 3,171). The an-jka of Hercules meant therefore properly only the limit of his western conquests, and hence so many disputes where they were to be found, till the idea of columns decided in favor of the Rock of Gibralter and the hill of Ceuta. Tingis (Tangier) was the original seat of Antaeus, the "opposite" to Hercules, to whom the coast of Spain belonged. Solinus,24."7 In view of what has been discussed, it seems reasonable to suggest that the Pillars of Hercules once represented a synonym for the western extent of the Phoenician trading network and was referred to as such to display the spatial characteristics presented by their temples to their god Melkarth. Dominated by the large temples flanking the Straits at Gades, Tingis, and Lixus, the "Pillars" were also complemented by numerous smaller temples consecrated to him along both shores of the Atlantic coast.
