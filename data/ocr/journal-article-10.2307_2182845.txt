<plain_text><page sequence="1">IRRA TIONALISM AND RA TIONALISM IN RELIGION. By ROBERT LEET PATTERSON. Durham, Duke University Press, I954. Pp. I55. $3.00. Professor Patterson's thoughtful and provocative book might well have been entitled "The Faith of a Mystical Rationalist." He has re-examined a number of issues which have never grown stale for the philosopher of religion. Some of these include the problem of evil, the 286</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS naturalist and religion, and the existence and nature of God. Two of the more original discussions in the book are a quasi-serious defense of anthropomorphism in religion (p. 59), and an unusual encomium on Zen Buddhism (pp. 6o f.). Patterson's book is divided into three chapters, each of which ex- presses a major thesis. (i) The first thesis is that both naturalism and neosupernaturalism are untenable in our universe and that both are invidious to the cause of true "rational" religion. It is unfortunate indeed that Patterson nowhere defines "religion" since it is by no means obvious what it means to him. What seems to emerge instead of a definition is that only the rationalist can be truly "religious." From this we should perhaps conclude that "religious" means being "aware of ... kinship with the whole" universe (p. I48). (2) The second thesis is that the attempt to combine "rationalism" with "irrationalism" cannot succeed because "irrationality is appear- ance only and . . . the reality behind it is rational" (p. 67). The evidence for this statement is presumably that (a) if it were not true scientists would not have the faith to continue their search for regular- ities, and (b) that logic and mathematics are dependent upon it. (3) The third thesis is that the universe is rational, that "there is nothing self-contradictory in the supposition that the universe may contain a superhuman person" (p. I46) and that for the "religious" rationalist "reason takes on . . . a mystical significance" (p. I48). Furthermore, "philosophy and religion blend together, for, at bottom, they are identical" (ibid.). One cannot help thinking of Professor Patterson that he uses his scholarship to render the untenable plausible. Let us examine his argument for the rationality of the universe. He says, "I am persuaded, nevertheless, that there are convincing arguments which constrain us to regard the universe as constituting a coherent and rationally ordered system" (p. II7). What are these convincing arguments? I shall restate them briefly: (i) The first argument is that there is a relation of logical entailment in the universe (following A. C. Ewing) depending upon a system of substances which may very well be rational (pp. I i8 f., my italics). (2) The second argument is that there are minds and there are values such that either logically entails the other in a single system. By this is meant, if I catch Patterson's intention, that values could not be objective unless the universe were' a rational system (p. I 20). But values must be objective according to him. And therefore the universe is a rational system! What appears to follow is that "the 287 P*</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS universe is rational in the sense . . . that it constitutes a system of interconnected entities the reality of any one of which logically entails that of all the others" (p. I3'). A few pages later Patterson says that "the universe is rational in the necessitarian sense, but . . . we cannot adequately envisage it as rational" (p. I41). If we now return to Patterson's three theses it would seem to me, first, that the naturalist may very well feel kinship with "the whole" quite as much as the rationalist since there is no principle which denies that one can feel kinship with the irrational, nonrational, or rational plus irrational. Hence, the naturalist may be "religious" in this sense. Patterson would doubtless disagree with this contention because of the tendency of "evolutionary naturalism which professes to reduce mind to a status of cosmic insignificance" (p. 3). But I know of no such profession by such evolutionary naturalists as Sellars, Morgan, Alexander, or the Krikorian group. Even a logical empiricist, I feel, would hesitate to do this even if he could ascertain what it meant. Second, I do not believe that Patterson has shown by any con- vincing argument why the universe cannot be partly rational and partly irrational, even if I do not approve of this manner of discussing the universe. Here his inability to "explain" the existence of evil in a rational universe is crucial. Third, he has not proved the universe to be rational but has only stated that it possibly is. And even if it were rational, I find no argument to defend the view that it contains a superhuman person or that philosophy and religion "are at bottom identical."
