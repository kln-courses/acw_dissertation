<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEMAND ANALYSIS* H. S. HOUTHAEKER University of Chicago IN A field where papers are plentiful but books are rare the appearance of a monograph by one of the leaders in its development raises high expectations. Professor Wold is perhaps best known as a mathematical statistician, but he has also made valuable contributions to economic theory [15] and his earlier empirical study on the demand for farm products [14] would no doubt be generally recognized as a classic if its language and time of publication had not curtailed its circulation. For the present work he associated himself with Mr. Jure6n, a govern- ment statistician; he has also drawn upon the support of a number of other distinguished collaborators in Sweden and elsewhere. It should be said at once, lest the following criticisms obscure the appreciation, that the hopes thus raised are not disappointed. Demand Analysis is a highly instructive and provocative work that no economist or statisti- cian could consult without profit, and for specialists it is indispensable. In common with other branches of econometrics the study of con- sumers' behavior requires knowledge of the relevant chapters of eco- nomic theory and statistics in addition to skill in the interpretation and utilization of observational data. The book under review is organ- ized around these three elements. After a first part which surveys the subject and summarizes the results there follow sections on the theory of choice, on stochastic processes, and on regression analysis: finally, some empirical investigations of the demand for foodstuffs in Sweden are discussed. Three of the five parts are completed by numerous exer- cises, some of which contain interesting new results. ECONOMIC THEORY The purpose of theory in an "applied" subject consists mainly in the formulation of (a) concepts in terms of which observations can be use- fully described and (b) theorems, phrased in those terms, that allow statements about situations for which adequate observations are lack- ing. The usefulness of these concepts depends on their maintaining a certain invariance between different situations; thus, if the quantities bought by consumers showed little or no correlation with prices and incomes the concept of a "demand function" would not be a useful one. * A review article of Demand Analysis: A Study in Econometrics, by Herman Wold in association with Lars Jure6n.

To what extent he has in fact shown this is a question to which we shall have to return. The formulation of demand functions is not the ultimate aim of what the author describes as the "Paretoan" theory of consumer de- mand, though it was as far as the "demand function approach" (G. Cassel [3]) was prepared to go. In order to state theorems about these functions additional assumptions have to be made. These assumptions, which have been expressed in different ways, link the demand functions for an individual consumer with his preferences for various collections of goods. The now classical approach, due to Pareto and also favored by Wold, attributes to the consumer a consistent preference ordering for all such collections. A more recent version, advanced by Allen [1], assumes that the consumer only compares collections that are very close to each other;' this, however, is not a genuine generalization, for as soon as there is a finite difference between compared collections a chain of comparisons can be made and we are back to the preference ordering approach. A third approach, originally proposed by Samuelson [10], expresses consistency of preferences directly as a property of the de- mand functions; the reviewer has shown [6] that this "revealed prefer- ence" approach, when appropriately formulated, is also equivalent to the classical approach. It has appeared worth while to go through these theoretical points because Professor Wold's discussion may easily mislead the unsuspect- ing reader. His theorem 4.6.1, in fact, seems to assert not only the equivalence of the marginal substitution and preference ordering ap- proaches, but also of the latter and Cassel's demand function approacb. In other words, the author does not regard the assumption that demand functions are derived from consistent preferences as an additional one; in his view these functions, lest they be "self-contradictory," must always satisfy the so-called "integrability condition," which expresses this consistency. Similarly, he declares the revealed preference ap- proach to be merely a variation of the demand function approach. In doing so he misinterprets both, for it has been shown [6 ] that the strong axiom of revealed preference, which is certainly not satisfied by an arbitrary set of demand functions, is a necessary and sufficient condi- tion for the existence of a consistent preference ordering. Using words 1 Wold ascribes this "marginal substitution" approach also to Hicks, but this is very questionable. Even as early as the well-known pair of papers by Hicks and Allen of 1934 [5] a discrepancy between the views of the two authors was evident.</page><page sequence="3">90 AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL, MARCH 1954 in their usual meanings there is nothing "self-contradictory" in a set of demand functions for which the integrability condition does not hold; all one can say is that the notion of preference does not apply to such a set. Wold's theorem 4.6.1 is therefore based on a petitio principii. If it holds true for the marginal substitution approach, this is only for the reasons given in the previous paragraph, and not because of Wold's circular argument. In any review more space is inevitably devoted to criticism than to commendation, and we add at once that apart from this slip2 the au- thor's exposition of the preference ordering approach in Chapter 4 is lucid and original. Chapters 5, 6, and 7, dealing with the specification of demand patterns, relations between demand elasticities and market demand, lift consumption theory above the formal level on which it is too often discussed. Still more stress might have been laid, however, on the preponderance of corner equilibria and the resulting restrictions on the validity of traditional calculus methods. Curiously enough the author has failed to see that Hicks' method of deriving market demand is exactly the same as his own, so that his criticisms are unfounded. The exercise 2.27, which is claimed to illustrate Wold's objection, is highly instructive nevertheless. In Chapter 8 applications of preference theory to the supply of labor, to barter and to price index numbers are discussed. Although Professor Wold points out and evaluates some of the limitations to Paretoan demand theory resulting from its static, non- stochastic and individualistic character, there is very little discussion of a possibly more serious complication, viz. that arising from consumers' assets. These assets, particularly in the form of durable consumption goods, lead to indivisibility problems and to the explicit introduction of time into the budget (see the recent work of Theil [13 ] and also Bould- ing [2]). Formally these problems may be covered by an extension of Wold's axioms, but in practice this is not very helpful; in fact the most difficult and interesting questions of theoretical and empirical demand research are precisely in this area. In a book entitled Demand Analy- sis readers should at least have been made aware of this field and referred, for instance, to the investigations of De Wolff [4] and Roos and Von Szeliski [9] on automobile demand. The preoccupation of the empirical chapters with food demand, though otherwise understand- able, may also leave students with exaggerated notions as to the scope of a purely static approach. 2 It might have been avoided if the aulthor had paid more attention to Samuelson's questioning [11] of a similar theorem in [151. As will be seen from the above Wold is also incorrect in describing the result in [6] as mathematically equivalent to his own assertion on the demand function approach.</page><page sequence="4">DEMAND ANALYSIS 91 STATISTICAL METHODS The statistical controversies in demand analysis are perhaps of more importance than the theoretical questions reviewed above, since the former have a greater bearing on the numerical results obtained. Early in the history of econometrics it was recognized that a statistical ap- paratus designed mainly for biological experiments may not be entirely reliable in the analysis of economic observations. Two problems in particular have given rise to an extensive literature: serial interdepend- ence in time-series and estimation in a system of simultaneous rela- tions. On both of these topics, as well as on some related ones, Professor WTold has much of interest to contribute. His discussion of time-series problems is based on a condensed but brilliant exposition of the theory of stationary processes, including a description of recent work by P. Whittle. He uses these results to show that in certain important cases classical least-squares methods retain their optimal properties in large samples, though the traditionally cal- culated standard errors may no longer indicate the goodness of fit. The special case to which the author devotes most attention is that of a recursive system. This is a system of behavior equations which can be solved successively rather than simultaneously. An example is the "pig cycle" model dt = D(pt) St = S(Pt-i) pt = pt-l + y(dt-, - st-i) where dt is demand, st supply, and pt price at time t. Professor Wold maintains-or at any rate leaves his reader with the impression-that such systems can be almost universally applied in economic analysis. It is not easy to summarize his argument, which is scattered over several chapters and appendix notes and sometimes hedged by qualifications that are not mentioned at a later stage. How- ever, there can be no doubt that Wold's emphasis on recursive systems is an essential element in his sceptical attitude towards the simultane- ous equations approach developed by Haavelmo, Koopmans, and others ([7], [8]). As is well known, the difficulties which prompted the latter development do not exist in recursive systems; more particularly, the coefficients in all their equations are identified and their least- squares estimates are asymptotically unbiased. There are clearly desirable properties, and it is therefore necessary to consider how wide the scope of recursive systems in fact is. Strictly speaking they are indeed universal: there is every reason to believe that the economy, to use an anthropomorphic simile, solves its simultaneous equations by trial and error. Individuals adjust their actions to</page><page sequence="5">92 AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL, MARCH 1954 parameters which they regard as fixed, but which are subsequently themselves affected by these actions so that new adjustments are re- quired. Static models in which equilibrium values determine each other without sequence or lags are an abstraction, and have been recognized as such for almost as long as they have been used. This does not mean that they are useless, nor even that they are less realistic than recur- sive systems, in which such lags occur explicitly. The problem here is that these lags are of very different length, rang- ing from a few seconds for the response of share or commodity prices to shifts in excess demand all the way to several years for the produc- tion of new ships or roads. In recursive systems of the kind described by Wold, however, lags have to be integral multiples of some unit pe- riod, usually the period to which the observations refer. If, as is usual in econometrics, annual observations have to be used, a one-year or two-year lag can easily be fitted in, but the question of what exactly should be done with lags of other lengths has not received Professor Wold's attention. In the absence of such a discussion his stress on re- cursive systems does not carry complete conviction. We may perhaps detect here, as in other places, the results of an insufficient analysis of the use of approximative theoretical models in empirical research. The logic of regression analysis is treated with its application to experimental data as a prototype; with the aid of this interpretation rules for the selection of dependent variables are given. There is much play with the notion of causality, even though it has long lost its former pre-eminence in the physical and biological sciences and has never been very popular with economists, who tend to think in terms of functional rather than causal relationships.3 Its introduction in any case hardly helps to bring out the difficulties peculiar to infer- ence from non-experimental observations, arising mainly from the fact that the latter usually have to be taken as they come and are available in limited number only. Models therefore have to be chosen with reference to the data with which they are to be used. The resulting problem of how to choose between models is nowhere faced squarely in Wold's work, though there is a somewhat inconclusive discussion of the effects of additional regressors on the estimates of parameters already taken into account. What is lacking, to put it in other words, is an adequate treatment of small-sample estimation. This compaint is of course not addressed to Professor Wold alone, for after Student's and Fisher's classical con- 3 Recently an attempt to rehabilitate the notion of causality has been made by Simon [8], whose point of view is very similar to that of Wold.</page><page sequence="6">DEMAND ANALYSIS 93 tributions progress in this important area has been disappointing. Con- temporary interest in estimation problems seems to be mainly centered on estimators with various asymptotic properties whose practical use- fulness is often hard to see. Under these circumstances the author is unfortunately right in stating that for small samples we have to be satisfied with "the rough inference drawn by the use of large-sample methods," but this should not imply an abandonment of the search for more appropriate procedures. These comments are mostly elicited by Wold's stimulating Chapter 2, in which he attempts to show that least-squares regression, despite the objections from Oslo and Chicago, is "essentially sound." The words in quotes are in fact characteristic of his attitude of militant con- servatism on many points of controversy in statistics and elsewhere. Not all readers will find their doubts quieted by the forceful but occa- sionally one-sided array of arguments, but they will learn a great deal from trying to refute them. EMPIRICAL FINDINGS The empirical part, for which Mr. Jureen was jointly responsible, describes an extensive investigation of food demand in Sweden under- taken in connection with an inquiry into the long-term position of Swedish agriculture. Both family budgets and market statistics are used as source material. In line with Professor Wold's views on statisti- cal methods as discussed above only a few technological innovations are to be noted. The numerical results, subject to the validity of the techniques employed, are on the whole very reasonable and their dis- cussion, again with this proviso, is competent and illuminating. Our qualification refers to the authors' neglect of the supply side when deal- ing with demand equations, but this neglect is of course deliberate. The work on family budgets (Chapter 16) is based on three Swedish surveys dating from 1913, 1923, and 1933. It is shown that estimates of national food consumption obtained by blowing up averages from the latter survey agree fairly closely with independent estimates of market demand. This is the more remarkable because the sample was not ran- dom but voluntary and participants had to keep detailed accounts for a whole year. It is in fact by no means clear that the voluntary ap- proach is really inferior to the random sampling methods (with inevi- tably low response rates) currently in vogue. From these budgets income elasticities are estimated for a consider- able number of commodities and family types, quantity and expendi- ture elasticities being distinguished. In most of the analyses constant-</page><page sequence="7">94 AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL, MARCH 1954 elasticity formulas are applied, but since the results reveal that the elasticities are not independent of income, some use is also made of the group of formulas suggested by Tornqvist. No standard errors of the estimates are calculated, on the ground that they are not theoreti- cally justified for this material. Earlier in the book (Chapter 14) there is a short discussion of equiva- lent adult scales where a method for determining the weights is pro- posed. This consists in calculating income elasticities in two ways: by pooling the separate estimates for different family types and by deriv- ing a joint estimate for all households after their expenditures have been divided by the relevant number of equivalent adults. If the scale is correct, the two calculations will yield the same result. This agree- ment, however, is in general only a necessary and not a sufficient con- dition for correctness. Except in the case where only two kinds of per- sons (children and adults, for instance) are taken into account no unique scale will be obtained by Wold's method, and in practice it is desirable to specify many more categories of persons. Moreover, al- though Wold recognizes that the scale for total expenditures should be different from the scales for particular items this point does not seem to be allowed for in his method of computation. Professor Wold's views on the relation between the income elastici- ties estimated from family budgets and those estimated from time series are also worth noting, especially since he was (in [14]) the first to com- bine the two sources in the manner now widely adopted. He distin- guishes between short term and long term elasticities and maintains that the two sources both estimate the latter variety, which is usually the more interesting one. Because of the continuous introduction of new commodities, however, he thinks that the elasticities obtained from budget data on the whole tend to be smaller than those that refer to market statistics. This is an interesting observation, but it is not so clear that the time-series elasticity is really a long term figure and this somewhat weakens the author's conjecture. In their work on market statistics (Chapter 17) Messrs. Jureen and Wold frequently use "conditional" regression analysis with income elasticities inserted as if they were known from other sources; they do not always use the estimates obtained from budget data but supple- ment these by "common sense" arguments. Sometimes they fix the price elasticity instead of the income elasticity. Standard errors of the estimates are calculated by means of a new formula which allows for autocorrelated disturbances. The symmetry of cross-price elasticities according to Slutsky and Hotelling is tested; it is found to hold rather</page><page sequence="8">DEMAND ANALYSIS 95 strikingly in the case of pork and beef, but much less so for animal and vegetable foodstuffs. Some more general points in market demand are discussed in Chap- ter 15. Wold there pronounces himself against trend removal but in favor of deflating prices and incomes by a general price index. With the first advice the reviewer agrees, and, at any rate in the case of food- stuffs, also with the second. The author's argument on the latter ques- tion, however, is very superficial. He recommends deflation to correct for "changes in the monetary unit," and refers to Schultz [12] in sup- port. Schultz, on the contrary, advocated deflation because it increases the degrees of freedom by one even though there is no exact method of taking changes in other prices into account. This is a much sounder argument, which shows incidentally that deflation is not invariably appropriate whereas Wold implies that it should always be applied. In the final Chapter 18 the most interesting contribution is a detailed forecast of 1949-50 food consumption oin the basis of pre-war demand functions tested against actual consumption in the forecast period. It is shown that the forecasts are on the whole reasonably accurate, and that in most cases they are nearer to the observations than the pre-war average on which a "naive" forecast might be based. It would be cap- tious to deny that this satisfactory result speaks well for the validity of the methods used, whatever doubts one may have about their theoreti- cal justification. CONCLUSION According to the preface Demand Analysis "is written in the dual form of a research report and a specialized textbook of econometrics." There are advantages and dangers in such a combination, particularly for the textbook half, and both are conspicuous here. The main advan- tage is that the methods discussed can be illustrated by actual applica- tions though this is perhaps more effective if these applications belong to several fields instead of to a single rather narrow one as is the case here. Moreover readers will look in vain for actual applications of most of the economic theory and much of the statistics discussed in the eailier parts of the book. The dangers of the dual form are even more appar- ent. It has been pointed out already that the preoccupation with food demand in the empirical sections has led to an unfortunate neglect of dynamic factors. If industrial commodities had been studied as well as agricultural ones, there might also have been less inclination to ignore the complications due to simultaneous equations. As a textbook Demaind Analysis therefore has serious limitations,</page><page sequence="9">96 AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL, MARCH 1954 which means that its use as such requires a considerable amount of additional explanation and amendment. The arrangement of the mate- rial could also be improved and much repetition eliminated. Professor Wold could hardly be blamed for not writing a standard work, since the subject is still too young to admit of one, but he would have come closer to writing one if he had been as successful in interpreting the ideas of others as he is in expounding his own. What we have here is essentially an admirable statement of the opinions and methods favored by one expert for his own research interests, and as such the book is an occasion for unqualified gratitude.
