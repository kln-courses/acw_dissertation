<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SMILING HEAD COMPLEX FROM CENTRAL VERACRUZ, MEXICO Various authors in the past have speculated on the epoch and culture to which the so-called "Laughing Faces" belonged. But with only a small number of sporadic finds they have not been able to explain satis- factorily their origin, cultural epoch, symbolism, or typo- logical evolution. There exist, however, some useful works on the subject, such as those by Phillip Drucker, C. W. Weiant, J. L. Melgarejo, Vladimiro Rosado Ojeda, Alfonso Medellin Zenil, and Fredrick Peterson. In the fall of 1952 the antiquity market of Mexico City was suddenly flooded with sculptured pieces of which the "Laughing Faces," or "Smiling Heads," formed the chief part. Their source was made known when the Presidente Municipal (Mayor) of the village of Joachin, in the municipality of Tierra Blanca, Vera- cruz, denounced illegal excavations in his territory. The looting of the archaeological zones had taken place in the small communities of Los Cerros and Dicha Tuerta. The Department of Anthropology of the State of Vera</page><page sequence="2">FACTS AND COMMENTS 163 Cruz decided to send its technical staff to the site of the depredations. Alfonso Medellin Zenil was in charge of this excavation and Roberto Williams was field assistant. Fortunately they arrived in time to save the greater part of the deposits, and to excavate them properly. The deposits proved to be dumping places or rubbish heaps of extraordinary richness, both in quantity and quality of the artifacts discovered. Until this find only half a hundred of these smiling heads existed in public and private collections. About 800 pieces from the exca- vations are now in the custody of the Department of Anthropology of the State of Vera Cruz, in the city of Jalapa. Besides these, approximately 400 were sold on the collectors' market. The majority of these have been studied and photographed by Fredrick A. Peterson, under the auspices of a Wenner-Gren Foundation grant, in-aid. This study was united with that of Alfonso Medellin Zenil to make the present article. The two archaeological zones are found in the south- ern limits of the semiarid zone of central Veracruz, bordering on the swampy lands of the territory of La Mixtequilla. The region is flat, with a shallow layer of soil to a depth of approximately 50 cm., under which is found tepetate, a sandy crumbly rock. This condition allows the growth of only more or less rachitic tropical flora. The deposits were discovered accidentally by native farmers upon breaking soil with their plows for seeding corn. As the soil is extremely shallow, archaeological sites are in great demand for corn raising as they usually contain greater depths of soil. The rubbish heap of Los Cerros was situated in an artificial platform located on the outskirts of a small ceremonial center, between two earth mounds. This artificial platform was entirely filled with broken or discolored clay artifacts. No other mate- rial, such as stone or bone, was found. This is very significant, showing the existence of a specialized kind of rubbish heap. As the artifacts represent the expres- sion of hierarchic art, and were sacred objects, we con- clude that this deposit is composed of material which had been broken or discolored in the baking process, rejected, tossed into a pile, and covered with earth. The rubbish heap of Dicha Tuerta was also located on the periphery of a small ceremonial zone, and was restricted to a small decline next to an earth mound. Excavations were first begun at Los Cerros, removing the earth that the pot hunters had explored, leaving the holes clean to take advantage of the untouched deposits. Contiguous stratigraphic pits were extended until the site was completely cleared of ceramic remains. A total of 347.50 sq. meters were explored, of which 45.50 sq. meters belonged to Trench No. 1, made in one of the two mounds. The excavation at Dicha Tuerta was made in two pits, which also completely cleared the rubbish heap, for a total of 89 sq. meters. In the field catalog, careful note was taken of the stratigraphical position of each piece or group of pieces, as well as their relationships to local and imported ceramics. Here we will mention only the most important results, leaving the detailed report to a monographic study. This discussion is naturally hampered by the fact that only clay artifacts were found in these deposits. A definitive study of the smiling head complex should, of course, consider all possible related materials. The typological antecedents of the figures discussed here were found in the excavations of Remojadas (Me- dellin 1951), and Loma de Los Carmona (Medellin 1952). These belong to the period termed Remojadas Superior I or the Early Classic horizon of central Vera- cruz. (Fig. 54, E). They are mold made and in the form of whistles, and rattles, with much applique orna- mentation. In the lowest layers of Los Cerros and Dicha Tuerta appeared some artifacts which show a striking relationship to those of the above mentioned sites (Figs. 54, F; 56, 0, P). Approximately 75% of the total number of artifacts found belonged to the smiling head or laughing face type. They are complete masculine or feminine figures, for which the designation of smiling heads is inadequate since the heads were once attached to bodies, but as tradition has established this term it will be used here. The figures are made of a sandy clay, basically brown or reddish-brown in color, with yellow, red, gray, and orange variations. The paste is soft and crumbly. It is possible that the majority of these figures were once covered with a polished slip of a reddish-orange color or a creamy-white. However, this slip was so soft and fugitive that in the majority of examples only barely perceptible traces remain. On some few pieces the use of red, white, and black paint is barely discernible, over the slip. rhe figures were cast in molds, with some details sharpened or added by fingers or sticks. Finger marks are visible on the inside of the figures, showing that the clay was pushed into the molds. They are made in at least two sections, front and back, with the joints perfectly smoothed. It is believed that the arms and heads were made in separate sections. The figures are reinforced at weak points with clay tubes. Some authori- ties have thought that the placing of a "spigot" under the head was in order to imbed the heads in the walls of temples. In reality it is a reinforcing tube which aided in uniting the head with the shoulder section (Fig. 55, D). Circular or triangular holes are found in different parts of the bodies, which permitted the baking-steam to escape. TIhis explanation, however, does not apply to the straight or curved slits and circular holes in the heads, which were probably made as points of insertion for plumage or other decorative materials. Some masculine bodies are completely nude, while others wear loincloths (Figs. 54, E, F; 56 0), pectoral bands (Figs. 54, E, F; 56, 0), necklaces, and also orna. ments on the ankles and wrists. Some of the nude fig, ures are shown grasping long locks of hair (Fig. 54, H). The loincloths and pectoral bands are frequently deco, rated with reliefs representing eagles, serpents, plumed serpents, anthropomorphic figures, geometric motifs, and</page><page sequence="3">164 AERICAN ANTIQUITY [XX, 2, 1954 .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1 ^- t p wNo FI .-5.Ca ariact rmDcaTet n o ers ,Chaee;E rmLm eLsCroa Reoaa ueio ;F ht Lisa ,itrybo drmn;H uefgr rsighi ok;1llc J,PeCascha;KL etha_ I-Vtps ,H eutol ,Mclneuti ,Xciuta,My trade~' pic;P_mln edwt oeedrle fEhct-utacal</page><page sequence="4">FACTS AND COMMENTS 165 , :.. . . .... . ..

It is not clear whether these represent names, clan designations, sym- bols for deities, or merely ornamentation (Figs. 54, E, F; 56, 0). Feminine bodies wear skirts, pectoral bands, and neck- laces. The skirts are profusely adorned with stepped frets known as Xicalcoliuhqui, and other geometrical forms, as well as rattlesnakes, monkeys, serpent heads and the like (Fig. 55, Q). The smiling heads have been classified in accordance with their most conspicuous element, which is the head- dress and its ornamentation. As general characteristics of these heads we should mention the strong cranial deformation of frontal-occipital type, indicating use of the cradle-board, the intentional dental mutilation of type A4-B4 (J. Romero 1951), and the smile. This smile is responsible for minor facial characteristics such as eye wrinkles and occasional wrinkles and dimples in cheeks and chin. The tongue often protrudes roguishly between the teeth. This may be an old greeting habit meaning "I come in peace," or, "I have nothing to hide." The smile is rarely found on Mesoamerican artifacts, as they usually, represent the viewpoint of a theocratic- militaristic group, and the serious or grim expression is the reigning fashion (Fig. 55, L). In the epoch styled Remojadas Superior II, or Late Classic period of Central Veracruz, two phases have been distinguished. The phase termed Los Cerros I is the earlier and includes 2 types of smiling heads. These are known as "chata lisa" and "inter-eyebrow adorn- ment" (adorno entrecejo). The average stratigraphic depth of these 2 types, as is to be expected, is the greater. The "chatas lisas" have facial features closely grouped, on a smooth and almost flat surface, oval eyes, wide heads, and the expression seems to be a grotesque grimace rather than a smile. Adornment of the fore- head is either entirely absent or in the form of simple volutes. Often a figure holds a hand up to its mouth as though to stifle its laughter (Fig. 54, G). The "inter- eyebrow adornment" type resembles the "chata lisa," but the planes of the face are more correct and instead of a grimace we see a full smile. A V-shaped ornament, extending from the upper part of the nose up between the eyebrows to the forehead is the distinguishing mark of this type. This ornament seems to be clipped on to the bridge of the nose, resembling some found in the Maya area (Fig. 54, G). The characteristic types of the most recent phase of Remojadas Superior II, which is called Los Cerros II, are distinguished by their forehead ornamentation in relief. The designs portray herons, herons catching fish, monkeys, pelicans, iguanas, serpents, men wearing ser- pent headdress and labial mask, human faces, stepped frets, scrolls, interlaced designs, and various other types of elaborate geometrical decoration (Fig. 55). These figures are the culmination of an evolutive process of stylization. They are characterized by the fullness of their smiles, the realism of form, the classic simplicity of every feature, the mastery of manufacturing tech- nique, and more specifically, the oblique or mongoloid eyes, smooth handling of facial planes and curves, better proportions, and dynamic postures. The figures are in- variably adorned with ear plugs in diverse forms (round, leaf-shaped, "tiger-claw," and so on), bracelets that often have a bell attached, and sometimes one holds a rattle in his hand at shoulder height (Figs. 55, Q; 56, H). Hair is represented by parallel vertical incisions and is often shown tied up with a horizontal band. The hair is usually cut short on the forehead but sometimes locks of hair almost cover the ears. Hands are wonder- fully made, very realistic, delicate, and in graceful posi- tions (Fig. 56, I). It is interesting to note that some of the smiling figures have artictilated arms and legs, similar to those found in Teotihuacan III, or the Tepeti phase of the Maya zone (Fig. 55, K). A trait which may be shared with the Maya is the use of a string of beads dangling from the forehead between the eyes (Fig. 55, E). It is possible that this was used to cause artificial strabismus, as with the ancient Maya. Among the clay sculptures which do not belong to the smiling head type but form part of the complex, similarities with the following divinities have been observed: Mictlantecuhtli (Lord of the world of the dead), Huehueteotl (the Old God- Lord of Fire), Quetzalcoatl (a Creator God, Civilization, Artisans, etc.), Eehecatl-Quetzalcoatl (God of the Wind), Xochi- quetzal (the Precious Flower, Goddess of Love), Tlalte- cuhtli (the Earth God), and Cihuateteo (the Divine Women Warriors). One example was fbund of a personage bearing rings around the eyes, a moustache- like volute above the mouth, and large fangs, which is probably a representation of Tlaloc, God of Rain (Fig. 54, I). Another type of figure is that of the "babies-in-crib." All these figures show a baby, in crying or sleeping attitude, tied to a flat bed which rests on four small supports. They are all hollow and were used as rattles and whistles (Fig. 56, U, V). Similar figures have been found at Remojadas from the period Remojadas Inferior. A type of figure similar to the smiling heads but of a serious appearance, called "Las Serias" (the serious ones), is characterized by extreme realism. In fact these figures seem to represent real portraits of actual people, showing exquisite plastic beauty combined with a tran- quil expression (Fig. 55, N, 0). Numerous anthropomorphic and zoomorphic whistles were found. The former represent men and women in diverse attitudes too numerous to picture here. One feminine figure is totally covered with chapopote (as- phalt) and wears a buccal mask. The zoomorphic pieces represent charming figures of armadillos, bats, frogs, ducks, and other kinds of animals (Fig. 56, B, C). Deities are often symbolized by animal forms and the great variety of animal forms present in this complex probably reflects this type of symbolism. Another group of zoomorphic figures, not whistles, show monkeys,</page><page sequence="6">FACTS AND COMMENTS 167 _ s .................. s ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~... ........

These figures served as supports for large complicated platforms, surmounted by high arches on which spider monkeys are swinging. Although no complete example is known, these are important for their complexity, novelty, and for being found here for the first time in a recorded archaeological context (Fig. 56, A). The stupport shown in Figure 56, F probably held up the platform immediately above it. At Los Cerros, in the lowest layer of the dump, on the surface, and in the lowest level of Trench No. 1, indicating accidental finds, 4 pre-Classic clay heads were found. One of these is identified with the type "classic pointed chin' of Tres Zapotes Inferior (Weiant 1943: 84), and another with the figures of "incised eyes and rudimentary limbs" of Remojadas Inferior (Medellin 1950), (Fig. 54, 1). Trench No. 1 gave forth abundant pre-Classic monochrome ceramics, of sandy brown clay, with thick walls, and with polished slips of black, brown, reddish, and dark-wine. Some were decorated with incisions in geometric motifs with powdered cin- nabar rubbed into the incisions, of the same type as those found in Remojadas Inferior (Medellin 1950). On the surface of Los Cerros and in the first layer were found some ceramic fragments identified as the "stamped bottom" or Buff Poly-chrome of Drucker, of the Historic Horizon and also characteristic of Cuetlax- tlan and Quauhtochco (Medellin 1949; 1952). Two flat solid molded figurines were classified as Cerro de las Mesas Superior II. There was one fragment of ceramics of Quiahuiztlan II type which belongs to the Historic Totonaca period. Some of the materials of the Late Classic Horizon in these two sites contain elements that indicate relationship to, and presence of, other cultures. Rattle figurines were imported from the Maya region, probably Campeche, beloniging to the Tepeu Phase or the Late Classi.c Horizon (Figs. 54, 0; 56, L). These pieces indicate not only a simple commercial exchange or importation, but reveal a strong technological and ideological relationship with the contemporary materials of the Central Area of Veracruz (Peterson 1952). There are a number of pieces that might be termed "Mayoid," which are of local manufacture (Fig. 56, D, K, N, Q). In general there are many traits which are common to both regions. We find the use of up- raised hands, outstretched tongue, articulated limbs, mold making, use of figurines as rattles and whistles, babies in cribs, and elaborate headdresses in both re- gions. The articulated figures, the small figturines of trape- zoidal headdress (Fig. 54, K), and those that carry babies on the hips (Fig. 54, L) are similar to, and con- temporaneous with, Teotihuacan III-IV. Other points of similarity with the highland region are: hierarchic stylization, baroque tendency of ornamentation com- bined with strong classic facial features, uniformity of dress and adornment, as well as techniques of manu- facture, and the presence of the plumed serpent, Hue- hueteotl and other divinities. In the dump of Los Cerros, and in Trench No. 1, smiling heads were found in association with several complete bowls and fragments of the types "Untem- pered Orange-red," Drucker's Untempered Ware (Fig. 56, R), (1943), Untempered Grey (Fig. 56, S), and Black-on-white, characteristic of the period Tres Zapotes Superior (Drucker 1943; Weiant 1943; Medellin 1952). In accordance with the stratigraphic and cultural relations already expressed, and by way of conclusion, a fragment of the chronological table of central Vera Cruz is here presented (Table 6), showing the relation- ship to other arcas.
