<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE AN ALTERNATIVE SCHEME TO THAT OF SIR JAMES JEANS SIR OLIVER LODGE, D.Sc., F.R.S. IN the January number of the quarterly journal published by The British Institute of Philosophy, called Philosophy, Sir James Jeans with extraordinary ability has represented the view of the universe which may be held now in the twentieth century by a mathe- matician, and concludes that this representation contributes to and upholds an idealistic philosophy. Now with the contention that an idealistic philosophy is superior to any other, that is to say nearer the truth, we may be allowed to sympathize. Several physicists, even in the nineteenth century, were inclined to sustain the essence of Berkeley's view, or to consider that metaphysical truth must lie somewhere in that direction. G. F. FitzGerald, for instance, was notably of that opinion. But he was not prepared on that account to abandon the physical view of existence, and to take refuge in mere mathematical abstractions. The mathematical method has a surprising power of making deductions about the result of any given activity; but xwhen called upon to elaborate the actual details of the process, and construct a visible picture of how things interact, and trace in detail the course of their activities, it conspicuously fails. This failure is recognized by the mathematicians themselves. They know that their symbols can represent a number of different things, and that their equations can be correspondingly interpreted in various ways; but they do not find it necessary to interpret them at every stage of the process; nor need the mathematical transformation have any resemblance to the actuality of intermediate stages. Mathematicians can arrive at a result without forming a mental image or model of what is really happening; and so long as they attain a result which is intelligible, both at the beginning and at the end, they are satisfied. They have no need to follow the working; they go so far as to say that those who, in order to make a clear mental image of a physical process, postulate a mechanism not accessible to the senses and try to understand its actual working, are out of date and are left behind. Sir James Jeans seems to reject anything that the senses are incom- petent to display, saying for instance:- "The assumption that things existed which could not be perceived had led them into a whole morass of inconsistencies I38</page><page sequence="2">PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE and impossibilities. The new policy was not adopted of set purpose or choice, but rather by a process of exhaustion. Those who did not adopt it were simply left behind, and the torch of knowledge was carried onward by those who did." Yet it must be admitted that nearly all our progress in physical science up to the year I900 was made by men who adopted this very procedure. It is one thing to say that mechanism is not a complete explanation, or that it is difficult to follow; it is quite another to sweep it all away and say that there is no mechanism at all, that we must give up the idea of making a vivid picture of what is happening, and must content ourselves with abstractions, or what are called "mental concepts." I should hesitate myself to call them mental concepts unless they can be conceived: and I do not perceive that any serious effort is made to conceive them. I should prefer to call them inconceivable or unconceived mathe- matical abstractions. The old leaders were as well versed in mathematical methods as is the New School. The nineteenth century contained such men as Tait and Thomson, Stokes, Clerk Maxwell, Helmholtz, and many others. But they were not satisfied with the mere working out of their equations; they did not regard that as a complete statement of fact; they endeavoured to form a mental image or model of the working, and were thus led, not only to final results, but to some partial understanding or partial misunderstanding of the process by which they were achieved. In following this method they had, it is true, to postulate or infer the existence of entities which did not appeal to the senses, the laws of which therefore they could not explore experimentally, but which nevertheless they hoped to ascer- tain by further study as knowledge increased. This utilization of hypothetical agencies whose existence was inferred by means other than direct sense apprehension, was begun, or at any rate adopted (mainly in tentative or interrogative form), by Newton, and was continued with various modifications down to the twentieth century. It was not considered a disadvantage, at any rate not a serious one, that these things could not be actually perceived in themselves; they were perceived by their material activities, by the way in which their supposed activity operated on a material body. It was not considered necessary to put them out of court or deny their existence, merely because, like the corpuscular particles of light, they were directly inapprehensible. The whole doctrine of lines of force in space was of this nature, and formed the basis of the physical philosophy of Faraday and Clerk Maxwell. One effect of the lines could be displayed, in the case of magnetism, by iron filings; but the cutting of physical lines of force, as a means I39</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY of expounding quantitatively the induction of currents, was a device only justified by results. The idea of a gravitational or an electrical field had no other justification. But that was not con- sidered as a fact hostile to the existence of such fields; for there are many other things active in the universe which make no direct appeal to the senses. Experience shows that some material bodies are animated, but the animation is only inferred from the behaviour of the material body itself. The nature of life is unknown; we only experiment on animated organisms, that is on the material machinery worked by life; but few of us are willing on that account to deny that life exists. There is indeed a School of biologists, who would seem to be approved by Sir James Jeans, who agree with him that the only proper object of study is the behaviour of organisms as displayed to us through our senses, and that all else is wasteful or meaningless hypothesis. Twentieth-century science, according to Jeans, having become aware of a space-time continuum-though how it became aware of such an abstraction by means other than hypothetical interpretation and inference is not obvious-shirks an attempt to draw a concrete picture of this continuum; but "under the guidance of Poincare, Einstein, and Heisenberg," it apparently came to recognize that in science the "only proper objects of study were the sensations that the objects of the external universe produced on our senses." Rather an amazing and solipsistic statement, this, if pressed: it might be true for psychology. I fancy it may be a slip of the pen,- if so I do not press it,-for we surely try to study the things responsible for our sensations rather than the sensations themselves. How else can we gain a knowledge of an external world? But then, Jeans goes on,- "The dictum esse est percipi was adopted wholeheartedly from philosophy--not because scientists had any predilections for an idealist philosophy, but because the assumption that things existed which could not be perceived had led them into a whole morass of inconsistencies and impossibilities." Well, that is a strong statement: especially if it be taken to imply that things not perceived, or at least not perceivable, do not exist. It would have very much surprised Professor Tait, not to mention Newton himself. Professor Tait, the centenary of whose birth we might have been celebrating last year along with the other cen- tenaries, did not hesitate to postulate an "unseen universe," that is a whole collection of existences which make no direct sensory appeal. 140</page><page sequence="4">PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE But twentieth-century science apparently sweeps these away, one and all, "not from choice, but from necessity. They had to be swept away, because their presence introduced confusion and incon- sistency into the scientific picture of the world." But it may be contended that the sweeping away is not improving matters: we are left with no picture at all! Denial of everything that cannot be directly perceived by the senses seems to me un- worthy of modern science: we cannot really be satisfied with mathe- matical abstractions alone, even if we call them mental concepts; nor need we limit the attention of science to things that affect the senses, still less to the sensations themselves! THREE STAGES IN SCIENTIFIC HISTORY The history of science is divided by Sir James Jeans into three periods, of very different lengths, which he calls respectively the animistic, the mechanical, and the mathematical. The first period lasted from the earliest ages up to Galileo and Newton: the second period from Galileo and Newton down to A.D. I901; the third period is the portion of the twentieth century we have so far lived through. Well, when we consider animated matter, I am not at all sure that we shall not have to find some truth even in the doctrines of the first period. In fact I might put it more strongly; for my attention has just been called to the Gifford Lectures of Professor Stout called "Mind and Matter," in which he deals, on the whole favourably, with animistic views. However this may be, the second or material- istic period taught that "inanimate nature appeared to behave as though its constituent pieces exerted pushes and pulls on one another, exactly similar to those we exert on them by the action of our muscles-it was in this way that the science of mechanics had its origin. Each piece of matter was supposed to exert a 'force' on every other piece .... The force which A exerted on B was equal in amount to that which B exerted on A. When the forces were gravitational or electrical, the bodies need not be in contact." (I should not express the facts precisely in this way, and will deal with the discrepancies directly.) He then goes on to say that as knowledge increased, or "as science began to wander farther from home, its inferences as to the nature of the assumed machinery became first con- fused, and then contradictory and absurd, until finally there I4I</page><page sequence="5">P HILOSOPH Y was only one inference possible, namely, that the assumed machinery did not exist at all." The idea that objects pushed or pulled each other about "was as much an anthropomorphic error as the earlier animistic universe of our primitive ancestors," for in it the analogy of whims and caprices was replaced by the analogy of muscles and sinews. So, to evade the error, instead of searching for the mechanism elsewhere, the idea of "force" was abolished; and, still more drastically, "twentieth-century science, penetrating to the farthest depths of the universe, has swept away" every part of the machinery. Now I know that this is the twentieth-century point of view, and I too hold that it is erroneous to contend that one piece of matter pushes or pulls another about; I know that there are many difficulties about the exertion of force by one piece of matter on another; at least so long as they are not animated, as in a football scrimmage. But there may be a way out, other than the mere abolition of what after all are manifest activities. Force, or rather stress, is a reality directly apprehended by our muscular sense. We experience it in a nut-cracker or a thumbscrew or a rack: we see it in the oscillations of a falling drop. The idea of force cannot be really replaced by acceleration, its effects are different, save when it is quite unimpeded or when the body acted on is small or rigid: and yet it is true that a material body A does not exert direct force on another material body B. Material bodies never really act on each other, for they never touch, and they cannot act at a distance. Newton knew they did not, and could not, when he promulgated the law of gravitation. What he really meant was that their motions could be investigated on the assumption that they were the same as if they did so act, particle by particle. The law of gravitation is a philosophy of "as if": so is Coulomb's Law. In Jeans's statement quoted above (on page I4I) about pieces of matter and the force they exert on each other, I accept his state- ment about what used to be said concerning exertion of force, but I wish to deny that directly acting bodies are "pieces of matter." I also deny the concluding sentence that when the forces are gravi- tational or electrical the acting bodies need not be in contact. I say, on the contrary, that things that exert force on each other directly must always be in contact, and that any force observed between two separate pieces of matter must be transmitted by something which is in contact with both. When a gun fires a shell, the gun has no direct action on the shell, although the momenta are equal and opposite: the cordite fires both in opposite directions. And its mass must be taken into consideration for accurate specification, unless it is either zero or infinite. There is always something between I42</page><page sequence="6">PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE two pieces of matter, whether the gap be perceptible or not. When something called A really acts on something called B, one of them may be a piece of matter, but not both. If motion results, work is done, and the energy lost by A is gained by B. The energy lost by A may be kinetic: if so, the energy gained by B is potential, and represents a strain in the ether. On the other hand, when the con- verse operation takes place, the energy gained is kinetic. The energy is merely transferred, somewhat as in a commercial transaction "Capital" changes ownership, without loss or gain; until the act of purchase (or of work) is complete.' There is a constant interchange of energy between ether and matter: what one loses, the other gains. One of the acting bodies is always the ether. All potential energy is therein stored, in imper- ceptible fashion, until it can be made manifest again by being transferred in kinetic form to matter. The action may be instan- taneous (or transmitted with the velocity of light), but the ether is an inevitable intermediary in every action between pieces of matter, whether it be perceptibly instantaneous, or whether it is obviously separated by space and time, as in a gravitational field. The existence of energy is continuous, and is just as real in the potential form as in the kinetic; only as it belongs to an entity which makes no appeal to the senses, its existency is not all the time conspicuous. Unless the ether is mentally recognized, the idea of potential energy gives or ought to give some trouble. It has been sometimes called "possible energy," in contrast to actual energy, a nomenclature which really plays havoc with the law of conservation. Certainly the energy is in full existence all the time, and I believe will be found to have identity, the same kind of identity as is possessed by a piece of lost luggage; though it may not be so easy to recognize when it returns to our ken, nor is it so ready to be labelled. Yet everyone knows that our fires are liberating energy emitted by the sun of the carboniferous epoch, which, having arrived through the ether and been stored by vegetation, has been locked up quiescent for a vast number of millennia, and now at length is being restored to the ether as low-temperature radiation.2 1 Economics can decide whether the purchase was justified: a transfer may be gratuitous, without adequate service rendered to anybody, as in gambling. So it can be also in physics; water can fall without achieving anything useful, and then there is waste, or increase of entropy. Energy which was tractable and therefore available, when possessed (as we call it) by high-level water, has been degraded into the unorganized and uncon- trollable molecular motions of low-temperature heat. 2 A little further elaboration may be necessary for cases of vibration. See Lodge's articles in The Philosophical Magazine for October I879 and June I88I. K I43</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY Returning to the law of gravitation, and contemplating the motion of a planet or a projectile "attracted" by a central body, we know now, even if we didn't know before, that these "attractions" are due to something between or surrounding the bodies, something not sensed nor yet adequately conceived, which is warped by the neighbourhood of a large mass; or as Jeans says, the framework is twisted up, so that the path taken by a freely moving body becomes curved. "The framework" is his name for the space-time continuum in which everything occurs. The influence of a warp or curvature in space is felt by a material body as a force; and if the body is large there may be some deformation. It appears to be a true doctrine that matter is inert and passive, never exerts force, or does anything else. Everything that happens is done to it. A leaf in the wind is a typical example. The wind itself is only displayed by its action on some form of matter: no one supposes that the kitten-like frolic of a dead leaf is inherent in itself. A piece of matter is perfectly inert, it always takes the path to which it is constrained-the path of least resistance. It never chooses its own path, whether of least action, or any other. How can a particle choose its path to a given destination ? Can we suppose it guided by the future ? How can light choose the point of impact on a mirror, so that its selected path shall be the shortest possible ? The principle of Least Action is not an explanation or guiding principle, it is no law of guidance, it is a statement of fact; it gives no reason, it is a blindfold and interesting method of attaining a result, as the Conservation of Energy was in Helmholtz's brilliant paper of I847. Applying the law of conservation, the intermediate steps of the process are ignored and unknown; a result is deduced, and is simply inevitable. That is the method of energy. It is a capital method in physics, but not one conducive to philosophical insight. Every idea of choice or self-determination applied to inanimate matter is obviously fanciful and figurative, though such language is often used in exposition. A particle cannot know, on setting out, which path is going to be the shortest or quickest or easiest. It cannot know what destination to aim at, nor by what route to travel. An inert thing must be guided instant by instant. The Wave Theory has long shown how the route of radiation is determined, and by what means it arrives at a focus. Every wave must arrive in the same phase, if they are to reinforce each other. Every bit of a wave-front thus builds up the next wave-front. The time of journey may be a maximum or a minimum. All that is necessary is that every portion shall take the same time, else they will arrive in discordant phases. Usually that condition is satisfied by a minimum; and so the principle of Least Action can be used to determine the path. So the path can be predicted, and it may look I44</page><page sequence="8">PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE as if the thing moving knew what it was about. But note that the wave theory is not limited to ascertaining or determining the final result: it enables us to follow the process throughout. It gives a reason why the quickest path is the one taken. Radiation is guided by the very properties of a wave. No question of choice or foresight arises. This mode of accounting for "least action" is admitted to be true for radiation. How comes it that particles behave similarly? What determines their route ? Well, that is really a discovery of twentieth- century physics. Every particle is found to be accompanied by waves and is guided by them. Guidance in both cases is due to some- thing etheric. The difference between a wave and a particle is getting partially obliterated. We have not yet heard the last of that curious discovery. It means that the behaviour even of a particle of matter cannot be understood without taking the ether into account. It may turn out that the very existence of matter will have to be explained in terms of the ether. The tables are sometimes turned in that way. Modern Physics is very dogmatic, and it has much to be proud of, but it does not see all the way yet. Its defect is that it is too ready to be satisfied with foreseeing a result, and does not care to follow the details of a process, even though the process is essential to the attainment of a given result. How can a particle foresee and choose the path of least action? No answer can be given unless waves are introduced, and waves imply something that undulates; even if (with the late Lord Salisbury when presiding over the British Association at Oxford in I894) we choose to call that something "a nominative case." TRUTH OF MECHANISM In contending against the self-sufficiency of mechanism, our enthusiastic leaders are too ready to sweep it all away, and to take refuge or to rejoice in formulae and abstractions. Yet machinery there must be. Results are not obtained by rubbing a lamp or a ring, but by mechanism of some kind. This is true even for Creation; not only is mechanism necessary for attaining a result, duration is required too. The processes of evolution are slow and gradual; the element of Time is essential. Space will not do instead: Time and Space are essentially different. The ratio between them is not numerical but kinematic: it is a certain fundamental etheric velocity. Our study of machinery is not ultimate, it is not self-designed or self-acting, but the machinery is there, and no good purpose will be served by ignoring it or sweeping it away. To summarize this portion: There is no real activity in matter: I45</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY all the activity lies in what it is the fashion now to call space-time, or what I prefer to call the ether; which therefore must have some structure, though the structure is not yet ascertained. The only force exerted upon a body is that which the ether exerts upon it. The ratio of resultant force to mass is acceleration. There is a universal contact action, with equal reaction: the action and reaction are not really between material bodies, but between one body and the ether in contact with it. In the case of gravitation, every particle of a large body is acted upon. When the force is greater per unit mass on some nearer particles than on others more distant, the body experiences tidal deformation. That in general has been my philosophy since the seventies of last century. And it is at least an alternative to the sweeping away policy adopted in the twentieth century. The great mathematical physicists of the twentieth century didn't understand how the mechanism worked,-didn't understand any better than those of the nineteenth,-but they discovered that they could get results without attending to any mechanism, so they proposed to dispense with it altogether, and apply the blindfold but powerful method of mathematics. For inanimate matter this plan works, though it gives us no picture of the happenings; but for animated matter it fails. Every biologist and physiologist knows that an organism is full of complicated machinery: it is the action of the mechanism that they are studying, and usually they have no short cut to determine what the result will be. They are not tempted to sweep away the mechanism, as a mathematician is: their temptation is to sweep away the animation, to deny that life exists apart from matter. Their philosophy is apt to be materialistic. They really do try to study the objects of the external universe wholly through the senses, and to ignore anything that cannot be perceived. Many of them have found, however, that pursuing this far enough leads to difficulties, and is not conducive to clear conception or explanation. The self-will of an animal is puzzling: they can seldom predict what it is going to do. They try not to admit original or "purposive" action of any kind, yet purpose is forced upon them by observed facts. Both modern physicists and biologists therefore are liable to make the same kind of mistake; they are liable to ignore the thing in which the activity really resides. They are thus led to conclusions opposite in character but equally gratuitous. The biologist tries to think of mind as a function of matter, and to explain everything in terms of mechanism. The modern physicist ignores the mechanism, and having learnt that by mathematical reasoning he can attain results in the inorganic world without it, concludes that the universe is governed by mind. In that conclusion he may be correct. I say nothing against the idealistic philosophy. I sympathize with it. But I46</page><page sequence="10">PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE I don't want to prop it up by false buttresses: it should be strong enough to stand on its own foundations. Yet I would not have it supposed that I approve the motto esse est percipi, with the implied correlative non percipi non esse, as if everything that could not be either actually or potentially perceived was scientifically to be considered non-existent.' The policy of the clean sweep is very drastic, somewhat fashionable, but seldom justified. It is the policy of the builder who cuts down trees before erecting cottages: it simplifies his task, but it spoils the village. There are alternative policies. Mechanism need not be swept away, but by perceiving that the ether is the most essential part of it, it may gradually be understood. The properties and functions of the ether have still to be investigated. By this means physics and biology, which have drifted so far apart, can some day be brought together. The psychologist too can enter into his heritage; and the universe can be recognized as a complete whole, harmonious with the mind of man, who will not only anticipate part of its future course, but will be able to watch with a completer understanding every detail of the process. That is the sort of thing that can be attained by a really comprehensive knowledge: "the very hairs of your head are all numbered." THE EVASION OF AN ETHER With all deference to Sir James Jeans I want to contend that the Theory of Relativity does not abolish the ether. It only affects some of its imagined properties. An ether is still necessary, though it is not the ether of the nineteenth century: its constitution and properties have still to be made out. Apparently it cannot be moved, in the sense of locomotion: that is a function of matter. No one expects to "move" space: nor is what fills space subject to motion; it must behave as if it had infinite inertia. Ether is the seat of potential energy; it is the recipient of all strain; it alone exerts stress; it is the vehicle of an electric and a magnetic field as well as of all radiation. But in itself it is not like any other substance; nor is its behaviour applicable mechanically; (though whether some of it can be explained hydrodynamically remains to be seen). The motions, the accelerations, of inert matter are not intelligible without it. It is essential to all activity. I rebel against much of the philosophy of Mach, and often against the philosophy of Poincare. I take refuge in the brilliant philosophy of Einstein, to whom, in conjunction with Professor Max Planck, we owe such generalizations as are That "the sycamore tree continues to be when there's no one about in the quad" must be true both for science and for metaphysics: hence I insert the word "potentially." I47</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY suggested by w = hv. Let me quote a longish passage from Pro- fessor Einstein's lecture on Ether and Relativity given in the University of Leyden in May I920, and translated by Drs. Jeffery and Perrett as part of a book (published by Methuen) entitled Sidelights on Relativity:- "There may be supposed to be extended physical objects to which the idea of motion cannot be applied. They may not be thought of as consisting of particles which allow themselves to be separately tracked through time .... The special theory of relativity forbids us to assume the ether to consist of particles observable through time, but the hypothesis of ether in itself is not in conflict with the special theory of relativity. Only we must be on our guard against ascribing a state of motion to the ether. "Certainly, from the standpoint of the special theory of relativity, the ether hypothesis appears at first to be an empty hypothesis . . . but on the other hand there is a weighty argument to be adduced in favour of the ether hypothesis. To deny the ether is ultimately to assume that empty space has no physical qualities whatever. The fundamental facts of mechanics do not harmonize with this view .... Newton might no less well have called his absolute space 'Ether'; what is essential is merely that besides observable objects, another thing, which is not perceptible, must be looked upon as real, to enable acceleration or rotation to be looked upon as some- thing real.... "Therewith the conception of the ether has again acquired an intelligible content, although this content differs widely from that of the ether of the mechanical undulatory theory of light. The ether of the general theory of relativity is a medium which is itself devoid of all mechanical and kinematical qualities, but helps to determine mechanical (and electromagnetic) events .... "As to the part which the new ether is to play in the physics of the future we are not yet clear.... We do not know whether it has an essential share in the structure of the electrical elementary particles constituting matter .... "Recapitulating, we may say that according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an ether. According to the general theory of relativity space without ether is unthinkable." Surely that is a striking statement, coming from Professor Einstein, who cannot be considered antiquated and out of date. I48</page><page sequence="12">PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE EXPERIMENTS ON ETHER One reason why modem physicists are unwilling to accept the ether or pay any attention to it, is because they seem to hold the doctrine that the only things worthy of attention are those which make appeal to the senses and can be experimented upon. It is commonly said that all experiments on the ether yield negative results, by which is meant that they fail to give any answer, except zero. Special stress is laid upon the Michelson-Morley experiment, in which the question was put to nature, at what rate is the earth moving through the ether? the test applied being to compare the time taken by the to-and-fro journey of a light-beam in different directions. This comparison, it was thought, was bound to give a very small positive answer, of the second order of magnitude. And when this answer came out unmistakably zero, all our ideas were perturbed and had to be overhauled. A compensating cause was suggested by G. F. FitzGerald, depending on the way that matter might behave if electrically constituted and in motion. But that this compensation should be exact, as Lorentz on electrical prin- ciples showed it would be, was considered too remarkable to be satisfactory: and there were talks of a conspiracy among the forces of nature to prevent absolute motion from being discovered. So people were glad to take refuge in the Theory of Relativity, which postulated that such a motion was meaningless, or in other words, that the experiment must fail,-as all similar experiments made directly on the ether had likewise failed. But now I want to urge that perhaps we were not experimenting on the ether in the right way. We were aiming too directly at dealing with it. The ether does not appear to be a thing that we can directly deal with, it eludes our senses. There seems to be no way in which we can directly get hold of it. We have inferred its existence from the behaviour of matter, and that appears to be the right way to deal with the ether. Suppose we were trying to discover, by direct attack, any of the things that elude our senses, a gravitational or a magnetic field for instance, using ether waves as a test. Faraday's pertinacity was rewarded when dealing with a magnetic field, but the discovery was only made with the aid of a material body. The heavy glass in his experiment exercised a rotary action on a beam of light travelling along the magnetic lines of force inside the glass. With some substances the rotation was clockwise, in others it was counter-clockwise; so the effect observed was really an effect on a modification of ether inside matter, and was not made on free ether at all. In free ether the experiment fails. Faraday also made experiments on a gravitational field, but these all failed. If he had been a modern physicist he might have said, I49</page><page sequence="13">P H I LOS O P H Y "Sweep away the gravitational field: no such thing effectively exists." And yet the influence of a gravitational field on matter is conspicuous. The behaviour of matter near the earth displays the existence of such a field in almost every movement, though the effort is now made to express these movements in geometrical terms, without appealing to force at all. I should prefer to say that the neighbourhood of a large mass of matter so modifies the ether that the easiest path for a particle to take is the curved path that is actually observed. And recently, through the genius of Einstein, it has been discovered that light also takes a curved path when passing through a very strong gravitational field. Thereby the gravitational potential has for the first time been directly observed; but extreme conditions were required before it could be displayed: no ordinary experimenting would have shown it. The entire mass of the sun had to be pressed into the service; and the light had to come from a very great distance. By exceptional experimenting such as that, the ether itself may possibly be constrained to yield an observable effect. We have failed so far, perhaps only because we have not pushed the experiments far enough. We have perhaps been hasty in postulating that such an experiment will always be impossible. There may be a slow circulation of ether in an exceptionally intense magnetic field. It could be looked for, as affecting the velocity of light slightly in free space. It would be a delicate and difficult experiment; and the result is uncertain, as in any real experiment it ought to be. It might require circularly polarized light. Meanwhile, as in the case of gravitation, the most ordinary properties of matter display the action of the ether when rightly interpreted. Not only is it responsible for the curvature of the path of a projectile, and the weight of a block: we observe its powers also when we experience the strength of a rope, the stiffness of a rod, the elasticity of a spring. In all these and many other cases we are really face to face with the properties of ether. Cohesion is just as much due to etheric influence as gravitation is; molecules are held together by etheric links, and when the links are stretched, there is strain; but the strain is not in the matter. Matter itself is never strained, it is only moved; some portion of it is relatively altered in location, the strain thereby caused is in the connecting immaterial mechanism between the particles. Therein lies both the elasticity and the tenacity. The atoms of matter are separate indi- vidual particles, only welded together and held in position by etheric forces, either electric or magnetic or both. Whenever we wind up a clock we are really experimenting on the ether, whether the clock be driven by a weight or by a spring. We feel the ether quiver when we are toasting ourselves at a fire or basking in the sun. Less obviously, when a gas condenses to a liquid, it does so by reason of I50</page><page sequence="14">PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE the cohesive forces between the molecules; and again the ether is responsible. Hence a shower of rain is an indirect demonstration of an activity of the ether. Without the ether there could be no lique- faction, and the material universe would be a heap of dust, or rather a peculiar kind of perfect gas. So when people say that all experi- ments on the ether fail, -that it makes no difference to us, and that it can therefore be wiped out of existence,-they only mean that we have failed so far in tackling it directly; whereas indirectly, through the properties of matter, that is by the interaction of material particles with it, its influence is among our most common- place experiences. An Engineer does not recognize this point of view; and the reason is plain. For him a girder or a tie-rod is not an assemblage of particles held together by a uniting mechanism, he does not thus analyse a block of matter, he treats it as a whole. He need not trouble to account for the fact of cohesion, nor need he ask himself what strain among the molecules is really like. There before him is a material body, with measurable elasticity, density, tenacity, and all its other properties. He need not account for those properties, he can just measure them. He used not to worry about crystalline arrangement, until he found that its gradual genesis weakened his structures: he was content with a practical issue. Thus set free, an engineer could build bridges, cut through isthmuses, regulate the flow of rivers, construct magnificent engines, and do other wonderful work. So it may be long before he has to attend to the ether; unless indeed his business is telegraphy of some kind. But a physicist, especially a philosophical physicist, has to attend to the minutiae of atomic occurrences, and cannot be satisfied with the broad view rightly taken by the civil or mechanical engineer. CONCLUSION The behaviour of mechanism cannot be thoroughly understood in terms of matter alone. One particle of matter does not act directly on another. To have action you must have contact, and particles of matter are never in contact. If they ever get into contact, they cease to exist as matter, and turn into radiation. Their energy takes another form; from which apparently it finds a difficulty in escaping. Yet radiation can separate electrons from protons: a quantum of light can make an electron jump; and it may do other things, some of them perhaps not yet discovered. Consider also ordinary locomotion. Locomotion of matter through ether is difficult to observe, even when it is moderately fast. Already motion is known to increase the mass of a moving body. Mass is admittedly a function of speed. How is that to be explained without I5I</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHY taking the ether into account ? What kind of locomotion can increase the mass of a body save absolute motion through space ? and what sort of space can affect mass save one that has physical properties ? Moreover when we combine two relative motions we find that to do so accurately, an ether-constant c must be introduced into the expression for the resultant speed. How can we account for that if we ignore the ether? We can express it blindfold in a mathematical formula, but we cannot give a physical interpretation unless we penetrate into the mechanism more deeply. If we attempt to explore the mechanism we may be led to further discoveries. On the other hand, if we ignore the mechanism, we are left stranded in the air, with no foothold in reality, nothing but what is called "a mental concept"; a strange term for something that we are unable to conceive. Motion through the ether may be directly demonstrated some day, if we persist in looking for it. If we throw up the sponge pre- maturely and say that the whole idea is meaningless, we shall fail. When Faraday failed to find the effect of gravitational potential on light or electricity, he did not throw up the sponge and say it was impossible. He urged that further experiment should be made. Ultimately a minute effect on light was discovered; indeed more than one; but only by great skill, elaborate apparatus, and by aid of the vast masses dealt with in astronomy. I would ask the great mathematical physicists of our time, whose achievements we all so much admire, to try to look at things from a different point of view, and admit that there is room for reasonable differences of opinion, and that in the present state of our know- ledge, Philosophers have still some choice.
