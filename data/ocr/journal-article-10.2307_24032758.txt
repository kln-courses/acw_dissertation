West1 1 Department of Zoology, Oxford University, Oxford OX1 3PS, United Kingdom 2E-mail: melanie.ghoul@zoo.ox.ac.uk Received February 15, 2013 Accepted August 27, 2013 The term "cheating" is used in the evolutionary and ecological literature to describe a wide range of exploitative or deceitful traits. Although many find this a useful short hand, others have suggested that it implies cognitive intent in a misleading way, and is used inconsistently. We provide a formal justification of the use of the term "cheat" from the perspective of an individual as a maximizing agent. We provide a definition for cheating that can be applied widely, and show that cheats can be broadly classified on the basis of four distinctions: (i) whether cooperation is an option; (ii) whether deception is involved; (iii) whether members of the same or different species are cheated; and (iv) whether the cheat is facultative or obligate. Our formal definition and classification provide a framework that allow us to resolve and clarify a number of issues, regarding the detection and evolutionary consequences of cheating, as well as illuminating common principles and similarities in the underlying selection pressures. key words: Cheat, cooperation, deception, exploitation, intentional language, social evolution. The problem of explaining the evolution of cooperative behavior something about how the fitness consequences arise. Third, the is commonly framed in terms of the need to explain the selective term "cheat" has been used inconsistently across a diversity of forces that resist invasions by "cheats" but there is a lack of biological systems (Table 1 ). It is not always clear what exactly a consensus about what a "cheat" actually is. The terms "cheat" cheat is, whether a cheat is always a cheat, how selection favors or "cheating" are employed to describe a variety of traits and individuals that cheat, or how we would expect others to respond behaviors across a wide range of systems, from dishonest signalers to cheating. If different researchers use the term cheat in different to exploiters of mutualisms (Table 1). This suggests that many ways, then this will impede attempts to unify our understanding workers find the terminology a useful way to convey information of both the evolutionary biology of cheats, and the subsequent about behavior. In addition, the need to explain why cheating does implications. not lead to the breakdown of social systems is frequently posed as We aim to resolve these points of contention and the potential a major research challenge (Yu and Pierce 1998; Bronstein 2001; confusion arising from the use of "cheating" in the evolutionary Kiers et al. 2003; Travisano and Velicer 2004). and ecological literature. We first examine general arguments for In contrast, it has also been argued that the term cheat is mis- when intentional language can be used in biology, and provide leading and should be avoided in the biological context. First, it a definition for cheating that can be applied widely.

In forms of cheating, which have been observed in nature. Finally, we some cases, alternative terms have been suggested or used such as consider how and when selection is expected to lead to an effective "exploiter" or "greedy." Second, although other intentional terms counter-strategy to being cheated, and whether examining social such as altruism and spite are defined purely in terms of fitness behaviors from the perspective of cheats is always necessary or costs and benefits (Hamilton 1964), the term "cheat" also implies the most useful way forward. 318 © 2013 The Author(s).

If the benefit form what would normally be a cooperative response to an alarm of cooperation goes to the intended recipient, then this provides call.

Other examples include nectar robbers, biological organization (Bourke 2011). Meiotic drivers, such as which steal a flower's nectar, but are not the recipients that fulfill sex chromosome drivers, cheat other alleles at that locus (Burt the flower's pollination services (Richardson 1995; Maloof and and Trivers 2006). Cells within multicellular organisms can cheat Inouye 2000), or a man who raids a beehive is not the "recipient" other cells. For example, in the fruiting bodies of Dictyostelium of the cooperative act of producing honey. In all of these cases, the discoideum slime molds, or Myxooccus xanthus bacteria, cells cooperative act is only favored by selection as a result of a benefit could increase their likelihood of being in the reproductive spore provided to the intended recipients—female frogs and crickets, head, rather than the stalk that holds the spore head up (Strassmann pollinators, and colony mates.

Deception is cheating when it manipulates a cooperative signal ing system. In contrast, deception will not be cheating when it is exploiting a feature of the world that can be used as a guide to action, termed a "cue" (Maynard Smith and Harper 2003). For example, when anglerfish lure in prey with bioluminescent "bulbs," they are being deceptive, but they are not exploiting a cooperative signaling system, and so this is not cheating. An Deception without cheats flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) and sundew plants (Drosera an glicä). If these plants were mimicking flowers to attract in and eat pollinators, then they would be exploiting the cooperative plant-pollinator signaling, and so would be cheats. However, if they were just mimicking a cue of a food source, to attract in a range of insects, including nonpollinators, then they would not be exploiting a cooperative interaction, and so would not be cheats. Empirical data supports the latter (Ellison and Gotelli 2001; Murza et al. 2006; Ellison and Gotelli 2009; Gibson and Waller 2009). B Deceptive cheats Deception without cheats Deceptive cheats B Deception without cheating and deceptive cheats. Not all deceptive behavior implies cheating. Deception can be divided into those that manipulate cooperative behaviors (cheats) and those that do not (deception without cheating). A common form of deception without cheating is deceptive predators such as: (A) Choeradobis rhombicollis, leaf-mimicking praying mantis; (B) anglerfish; (C) Dionaea muscipula, venus flytrap; (D) Drosera sundew plant.

First, if cheats are discrimi Our definition of cheating suggests that because cheats can ex ploit the cooperation of others, they should be able to invade and spread into populations. Consequently, when we observe cheat ing, we might be looking at a stable equilibrium of cooperators and cheats, or at a form of cooperation that is breaking down and on its way out. A key factor here is whether the fitness of cheats is frequency dependent, such that the relative fitness of cheats decreases as they become more common in the system (Velicer et al. 2000; Fiegna and Velicer 2003; Ross-Gillespie et al. 2007). If such negative frequency dependence drives the relative fitness of the cheat below that of the cooperator, then a stable equilib rium is expected, where both cooperators and cheats will be maintained in the population (MacLean and Gudelj 2006; Gore et al. 2009; MacLean et al. 2010; (A). In contrast, if the relative fitness of the cheat does not go below that of the cooperators, then cooperation will be lost from the population (B). A nated against, but less detected at low frequencies. This appears to be the case in cleaner fish, where the client's have an image scoring ability allowing them to interact more frequently with cleaners that mainly cooperate while avoiding cleaners that they observed cheated frequently (Bshary 2002). Second, if the pres ence of cheats impacts negatively on population growth, then the more cheats there are in a population, the less opportunity there will be for cheats to exploit cooperators, as has been found in bacteria (Ross-Gillespie et al. 2007; Frank 2010). Third, if cooperators are able to preferentially benefit from cooperative behaviors, such as when cooperators are clustered together, or if cooperation provides a direct as well as an indirect bene fit, then this will lead to the fitness of cheats being negatively frequency dependent, as has been found in bacteria and yeast (Ross-Gillespie et al. 2007; Gore et al. 2009). o 10 1 Proportion of cheats in population Proportion of cheats in population 0 10 1 Proportion of cheats in population Proportion of cheats in population The relative fitness of cheats as a function of the initial proportion of cheats in a mixed population with cooperators. A relative fitness &gt;1.0 means that cheats have a higher fitness than cooperators, whereas a relative fitness &lt;1.0 means that cheats have a lower fitness than cooperators. Part (A) shows when the relative fitness of cheats drops &lt;1.0, in which case we would expect a stable equilibrium with both cooperators and cheats in the population.

Consequently, not only does the presence of cheats impose a selection pressure 011 cooperators, but this can lead to a coevolutionary arms race between cooperators and cheats. Possible examples of such coevolution include: (a) the conflict between brood parasitic cuckoos and their hosts, where the hosts are selected to reject cuckoo eggs, and the cuckoos are selected to circumvent this (Davies 2000; Spottiswoode and Stevens 2010; Langmore et al. 2011; Stoddard and Stevens 2011); (b) both cheats and cooperators performing better against their opponents from the past, but less well against future phenotypes, consider ing a laboratory selection experiment on biofilm production in Pseudomonas fluorescens (Zhang et al. 2009). Do we Need to Talk About Cheating? We emphasize that examining social behaviors from the perspec tive of cheats will not always be necessary or the most useful way forward. For example, the term cheat is used very little when discussing cooperation and conflict within the social insects, such as over the sex ratio or who produces male eggs (Ratnieks et al. 2006; West 2009). In these cases, it is often more useful to think about a conflict between partners with different interests, rather than one individual, or one class of individual, cheating another. The analogous point that terminology and concepts can be extremely useful in some cases, but not others, has already been made for other intentional language such as altruism and coop eration (West et al. 2007c). For example, terms such as altruism or spite, and theoretical tools such as Hamilton's rule, are rarely used in studies of some social traits, such as sex allocation in re sponse to population structure or relatedness asymmetries (West 2009). This does not alter the usefulness of either the term altru ism or Hamilton's rule, when studying other issues. The general point here is that although clear and unambiguous terminology can facilitate the development of a conceptual overview, terms need only be used when useful.

S. cerevisiae "cheat by stealing the sugar digested by their neighbors without contributing the (Greig and Travisano 2004) enzyme themselves". "cheaters-strains that make more than their fair share of spores in chimerae." (Khare and Shaulsky 2010) "Genetic mutants that fail to perform a group-beneficial function but that reap the benefits of (Velicer et al. 2000) belonging to the group should have a withing-group selective advantage, provided that the mutants are not too common." "As with any system depending on coordination, this transition is vulnerable to cheaters that do (Vulic and Kolter 2001) not perform a typical response (e.g., cells that fail to respond to cell-cell signals or cells that fail to halt cell division) but profit in some way from the fact that other members of the population still respond."

"A Proportion of nectarless flowers are known to occur within rewarding species and these are (Thakar et al. 2003) thought to be cheater flowers." caching systems based on reciprocal pilfering can be stable and are not necessarily susceptible (Vander Wall and Jenkins to "cheaters", animals that pilfer food but do not scatter hoard food themselves" 2003) "When hoarders live in a group, an additional cost may arise from 'cheaters', who do not store (Andersson and Krebs 1978) food themselves but parasitize the caches made by other individuals." " "Aprovechados" are non-mutualistic species that take advantage of a mutualistic association. (Tyre and Addicott 1993) For example, some bees and birds utilize floral nectar without transferring pollen. "Cheaters" are non-mutualistic individuals within a mutualistic species.
