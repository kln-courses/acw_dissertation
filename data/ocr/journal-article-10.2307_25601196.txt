<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL H. FRY Green to the Very Door? The Natural Wordsworth THERE IS DAZZLING AND VARIED REVISIONISM IN THE WORDSWORTH criticism of the last thirty years, yet aU the most influential rereadings have but one refrain: Wordsworth was not a nature poet. The 'seventies commentaries stressing visionary apocalypse took their point of departure from the dialectic between the tyranny of the senses and the dark, unpleas ant moments of "blank misgiving" in "the abyss of ideaUsm," moments when as a ch?d Wordsworth had to grasp a waU or a tree to be sure that such things existed.1 The rhetorical analyses suspending anthropomorphic language rather than imagination over this abyss argue that Wordsworth is one of "the first modern writers to have put into question, in the language of poetry, the ontological priority of the sensory object."2 And in the 'eighties return to the issue of social determinants theorized in its most sweeping form by Alan Liu, history manifested as ideology takes over the role hitherto played by language or imagination and reveals, through commentary, a paraUel truth: "there is no nature except as it is constituted by acts of poUtical definition made possible by particular forms of govern ment."3 Infighting aside, aU the criticism identifiable with these positions?to gether with the feminist criticism that reflects either the psychoanalytic leaning of the first position or the social historiography of the third?has i. See, e.g., Geoffrey Hartman, who cites the Isabella Fenwick "Intimations Ode" note to this end in his 1977 essay, "A Touching Compulsion," The Unremarkable Wordsworth (Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 1987) 20.

FRY continued to envision itself in coUective reaction against a grand metanar rative about Wordsworth which is purportedly so durable, so indifferent to changing reception horizons, that only Paul de Man's knowingly pe riod-bUnd expression, "Wordsworth and the Victorians," has a sufficiently focused energy of condescension to wrestle it into submission. In this view, there is enough of the old LesUe Stephen remaining in every successive Wordsworth scholar and critic to warrant the repetition, ever and anon, of the Matthew Arnold mantra, "poetry is the reaUty, philosophy the ?lusion"?but always with the proviso that Arnold was, as he finaUy admitted, no better than "a Wordsworthian" himself. According to this whole tradition?or stubborn prejudice?nature not only exists but it responds to human desire by communicating, among other things, ethical lessons ("ph?osophy"), and Wordsworth is the supreme poet of this com munion. Within the last thirty years, a good many critics have continued to uphold this latter view in one form or another but in most cases have not attracted much attention because the determined simpUcity of their argu ment and procedure, sometimes calculated, sometimes apparently innocent, has left Uttle for more intricate thinking to attach itself to (better to dismiss "the Victorians" once more with a wave). And the more formidable critics who have come forward to champion the "humanist" nature poet, pre eminently M. H. Abrams and Jonathan Wordsworth, have seemed com promised, ironicaUy enough, by signs of compUcity with the positions they attack. Revisionary critics have always been too generously aware that they stand on Abrams' shoulders, many having drawn their apocalyptic bent from his teachings, to want to quarrel with him as vigorously as he might have wished. And Jonathan Wordsworth, despite his affiUation with the CorneU-Dove Cottage network of textual scholars who consider interpre tive dispute an idle exercise best left to amateurs lacking the ab?ity to date holographs, nevertheless betrays too many symptoms: his deep engagement with the spots of time, his preference for the earUest possible Prelude manuscripts, and his intense disUke of the later Wordsworth make him an anti-naturaUst malgr? lui. In response to these tendencies, one point to be made in passing is that both sides of the "nature" controversy exchange positions more readily than they reaUze. It is worth at least sketching in the view, as I shaU below, that within the traditional mainstream there have been plenty of blank attended to narrative rather than lyric elements in Wordsworth (see her "The Erasure of Narrative in Post-Structuralist Representations of Wordsworth," Romantic Revolutions: Criti dsm and Theory, ed. Kenneth R. Johnston, Gilbert Chaitin, Karen Hanson, Herbert Marks fBloomington: Indiana UP, 1990] 350-70).</page><page sequence="3">THE NATURAL WORDSWORTH 537 misgivings about nature, while for the newer mainstreams the abyssal elements in Wordsworth are themselves, in their most uncompromising forms, the very prior sensory objects that were supposed to have been put into question. But these imputations are not meant to seem surprising or controversial; far from appearing as the glamorous result of antithetical critique, they arise merely from the almost inevitable confusion anyone is likely to feel when trying to say what nature is. (It is not surprising that so many distinguished minds have taken refuge in saying, in a certain sense correctly, that it is nothing.) A glance or two therefore at the historians of ideas who took an interest in Wordsworth's "nature" will resolve very little, undoubtedly, such is the hermeneutic circularity that undoes all such projects, but at least it will provide a kind of multiple definition to appeal to as need arises. And need will indeed arise, if anything comes of the prognostication by Jonathan Bate, in Romantic Ecology: Wordsworth and the Environmental Tra dition, that a "green" criticism of the 'nineties?supplanting the "red" criticism of the 'eighties?will make Wordsworth a nature poet once again.4 I too think that Wordsworth is a nature poet, and realize now that I thought so even when I was most deeply influenced in manner, tone, and selectivity of perception by the visionary wing of the "Yale School."5 But I still prefer to emphasize the via naturaliter negativa that I learned to recognize from that school (differing from Hartman?and from Hegel? only in doubting that this road points, or is meant to point, beyond itself), and I am inclined to criticize the notion of nature as "environment," as organic-systemic totality rather than ontological unity, that governs the polemic of Jonathan Bate. It is by way of engagement with Bate's inter esting book in particular, then, that I shall try to bring some measure of discrimination to bear on the difficult plight of not being very green yet still wanting to claim that Wordsworth is a nature poet. In the sections that follow, I attempt first to reconsider and relocate the nature topos in the diverse traditions of Wordsworth commentary; to participate in the return to nature heralded by Bate as much as possible on 4- See Bate, Romantic Ecology (London: Roudedge, 1991) 9. 5.

FRY my own terms (with remarks in passing on Home at Grasmere); and to show how and where nature remains even and especially in Wordsworth texts privileged by the commentaries of the last thirty years?and in the com mentaries themselves. i By Wordsworth's time, "nature" was a "technical" term (the expression is C. B. Tinker's), rather like our "physics," referring to the laws and opera tions of the physical world. Being "closely connected to the brutal and anti-Christian views of nature in the minds of Helv?tius and Holbach," this sense of the term, which can be traced back through Locke, tended to be used by those who were hostile or condescending toward poetry.6 Part of Wordsworth's novelty consisted then simply in reinvesting the scientificity of the term with poetic aura?"the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge," as he called such mediations of science in the 1800 Preface. He owned the 1781 edition of Holbach's Syst?me de la Nature and criticized it sharply in 1809, but not without having absorbed its physics.7 All he needed was a metaphysics, and that, we generally assume, was the " active universe" of the "Blessed the Infant Babe" passage (1805 Prelude 2.266). As Basil Willey summarizes: "his 'creative sensibility' had taught him that he was not alone with an 'inanimate cold world,' but with an 'active uni verse.'"8 H. W. Piper, the historian of ideas who has done most with this concept, perhaps overextends its pantheistic implications and its influence on the Unitarian thinking to which Coleridge especially was exposed in the 1790's, but he is able to argue authoritatively, citing Priestley, Erasmus Darwin, Hutton, and Cabanis, that "the belief that inanimate objects were in a literal sense alive came nearest to establishing itself as a scientific orthodoxy during the years of Wordsworth's most active poetic life."9 It is to such an "external World," Wordsworth writes in 1800 (the same year as the Preface and "Blessed the infant Babe"), that the "individual Mind" is "fitted," and vice versa, authenticating the imagination's "spousal verse" with nature.10 This is the basic information that has stood behind the debate about 6.

It would be obstinate to deny that there are many passages in Wordsworth, passages indeed reflecting something Uke an oyeraU conscious design, which conform to this general outUne, leaving traditional critics to disagree about questions of metaphysics: more or less pantheism, more or less mechanism (active or reactive), more or less of the insistent transcendence one finds in the Pisgah view from Snowdon or in the assertion that the spots of time make us feel that "the mind / Is lord and master." For aU such critics, no matter how much they stress transcendence, Wordsworth is a nature poet. But scientific and metaphysical ideas about nature do not exhaust the subject. There is also the ontology of nature: its mode of being, its status as beings or as a being, its relation to human being, and the being of its being. These are the issues, both in Wordsworth himself and in the history of his reception, that begin to confuse the way he has been and can be read. The results of this confusion can seem unproductive (it is in its ontological register that nature in the critic's hands gets lost in a chaos of referents); but for aU who feel that the most characteristicaUy br?liant verse of Wordsworth is always in some way an evocation of being as such, the subversion of meaning itself becomes a technique for making nature appear. It is with respect to the ontology of nature that I wish now to reconsider certain strains that can be heard, albeit faintly, in the criticism preceding that of the last thirty years. De Man caUs it a "temptation" to condescend to Victorian Wordsworth criticism, but himself perpetuates the notion that the nineteenth-century reading of Wordsworth was "moral and religious" (Rhetoric of Romanticism 85). Yet Pater, for example, stresses "the quiet, habitual observation of inanimate, or imperfecdy animate, existence." He speaks, to be sure, of the "sense of a life in natural objects," but he notes the "sensuousness" with which this sense is perceived (playing, in anticipation of Empson, on the senses of "sense" in Wordsworth); and he places the "active universe" theme in the service of an onto-phenomenological project which I am incUned to caU a levelling of being: "By raising nature to the level of human thought [Wordsworth] gives it power and expression: he subdues man to the level of nature, and gives him thereby a certain breadth and coolness and solemnity."11 Wordsworth's observation is trained, in other words, on the point of intersection between human and nonhuman being in order il. Walter Pater, "Wordsworth," Selected Writings of Walter Pater, ed. Harold Bloom (New York: Signet, 1974) 128, 130, 131. Pater almost certainly has in mind the passage in "Resolution and Independence" making the leech gatherer a mediatory figure between a stone, a sea beast, and a cloud?the passage Wordsworth cites in the 1815 Preface to illustrate the workings of the imagination.</page><page sequence="6">540 PAUL H. FRY to reveal something about the "widest commonalty" of being. Hazlitt had written repeatedly (in Lectures on the English Poets and again in The Spirit of the Age) of this "levelling" in socio-political terms, and from this standpoint he noticed how many of Wordsworth's characters ("female vagrants . . . idiot boys and mad mothers"?joined, he might have added, by the very young and the very old12) are only marginally possessed of normative human consciousness. The ontic common denominator sought by Wordsworth is what makes his "philosophy" seem illusory to Matthew Arnold, in his turn, precisely because it is undifferentiated, a universal diffusion, in widest commonalty spread, of "joy." To say, then, with Arnold, that Wordsworth "has no style" is also to say that, having success fully resisted the "false secondary power, by which, / In weakness, we create distinctions" (1805 Prelude 2.221-22), Wordsworth also has no mean ing?or, more precisely, that he underdetermines the signifier.13 According to the Unes from Arnold's 1850 "Memorial Verses" that seem most to have influenced the language and purport of Pater's assessment, Wordsworth "laid us as we lay at birth / On the cool flowery lap of earth." This way of looking at Wordsworth did not disappear in the first half of our century. Agreeing that philosophy in Wordsworth is the illusion, F. R. Leavis remarks that the poetry of The Prelude looks like a "paraphras able" argument but in fact is not.14 Here again is the "muddle" ascribed to "Tintern Abbey" in William Empson's Seven Types of Ambiguity, pointing toward Empson's analysis of The Prelude's "unintelligible" confusion of sensation and imagination in The Structure of Complex Words?readings which de Man considered to be the sole flickerings of truth in antediluvian Wordsworth criticism.15 Leavis too finds no coherent argument, and im putes the "wisdom" of Wordsworth's very incoherence to "his sense of communion with the non-human universe" ("Revaluations" 250). By the time Basil Willey wrote his "Background" books, what he called the "mergence with the inanimate" in Wordsworth was commonplace.16 It had already inspired the clearsighted invective of Irving Babbitt against Wordsworth's "primitivism."

In emphasizing dark transcendence in Wordsworth, Hartman, Harold Bloom, and their disciples have always scrupulously acknowledged an antecedent tradition: Pater on "the abstract expression of desolation in the long white road" ("Wordsworth" 129) inspiring A. C. Bradley's memorable pages in the Oxford Lectures on "the subUme" as "visionary power" in Wordsworth, foUowed by G. W?son Knight on "the hidden eternity-music in the inanimate" (the stone carried by the Arab) and D. G. James (appropriating Bradley for Christian pur poses) on "visionary dreariness."19 But even in this tradition there are moments of naturaUsm, signaUed by Knight's mystical disclosure of the eternal in the mineral. For James, the Beulah state revealed through Wordsworth's struggle for "unity of prehension" is the only state that can be known without the aid of Christian revelation, and he sees Wordsworth as the prophet of his own beUef that the imagination's meretricious way of achieving unity is necessarily linked to scepticism (Scepticism and Poetry 115). In this he resembles John Jones, another precursor acknowledged by Hartman, who attacks the notion that Wordsworth is a Unitarian poet, yet speaks of "the relational and monistic coherence" of The Prelude.20 Just so, naturalism in the criticism of the past thirty years persists as a moment to be overcome dialecticaUy. Hartman's dismissal of the primitivist view reflects his powerfuUy articulated beUef that Wordsworth is an En Ughtenment thinker?which is to say, a strong and knotty thinker.21 And 17- Babbitt, "The Primitivism of Wordsworth," The Bookman (U.S.A.) 74 (1931): 3, 10. 18.

FRY yet, Hartman would agree, Wordsworth's intellectualized version of anti self-consciousness, his chief gesture as Schillerian Sentimental Poet, is precisely to think the primitive, to make the primitive an object of phe nomenological reflection: "the desire of the Romantics is perhaps for what Blake calls 'organized innocence,' but never for a mere return to the state of nature" (BF 300-301). Still more problematic for the sublation of nature is the monism Hartman concedes in Wordsworth, in common with James and Jones: "there are no sharp breaks or ritual passings between one state of mind and another: vision is always continuous with sensation. Even such licensed rapture as Keats's 'Already with thee!' is avoided" (UnRW 11). For Hartman here, as for all commentators at such moments, questions pile up (showing, I have said, that the issue being skirted does not concern physics or metaphysics but touches, compulsively, on the being of being): "Vision" of what? "Sensation" of what? Vision of nature, sensation of spirit: whatever it is, it is what remains when the owls fall silent, suspending the Boy of Winander's belief that there is a natural channel of communication ("responsive to his call"), a fit, between human beliefs about nature and nature itself. As the pathetic fallacy hangs in the balance, a new vision of the "visible scene" possesses him, a vision not of life, as all modern critics who have been fascinated by this narrative agree, but of a silent being in nature which, somatically signalled, is also a being toward his own imminent death. As he once hung in life, so the site of his burial hangs now, suspended in permanent estrangement above that social scene of instruction ("the Village School") where nature continues to seem significant, as typically it does in those "Books" on which Book 5 remains an ambivalent critical meditation. If this account of the Boy of Winander, introduced as it is by Wordsworth's trademark reduction of the loco-descriptive to sheer ostensi?n ("There was"), appears merely to be a paraphrase of de Man's account in "Wordsworth and H?lderlin," a comparison can prove useful. Here is de Man: the sudden silence of nature was an anticipatory announcement of his death, a movement of his consciousness passing beyond the deceptive constancy of a world of correspondences into a world in which our mind knows itself to be in an endlessly precarious state of suspension: above an earth, the stability of which it cannot participate in, and beneath a heaven that has rejected it. (Rhetoric of Romanticism 54) What I for my part am not saying, though, is that "the mediation of poetic language" (de Man 54) puts into question the priority of the sensory object. Poetic language is in "books," and makes the owls hoot like people. The absurdity of Coleridge's having reproved Milton for anthropocentrically</page><page sequence="9">THE NATURAL WORDSWORTH 543 caUing nightingales melancholy and then having caUed them cheerful drunkards himself cannot have been lost on Wordsworth. This is what happens when you talk about the "jocund din" of birds; you are always "already with" them by unUcensed means. But poetic language can think the primitive, again, without being primi tive. Lionel TriUing relates the ch?dren sporting upon the shore in the "Intimations Ode" to the passage in Civilization and its Discontents in which Freud describes the "primary ego-feeling" as "oceanic."22 But it is the dark interpreters of Wordsworth themselves who have altered our taste in Freud?and Wordsworth?and refer us now to Beyond the Pleasure Principle: "The aim of aU life is death." Where it was, there shaU poetic language be. What the Boy of Winander realized is that "inanimate things came before animate ones," putting into question the priority of language to the being of death disclosed in the sensory object. In response to Alan Liu's recent version of the modern critics' revolt against nature?"nature is the name under which we use the nonhuman to validate the human" (Sense of History 38)?the reader who stiU thinks Wordsworth is a nature poet might want to say that nature is our own nonhuman existence, forgotten once named. 2 Jonathan Bate rightly attributes Liu's insistence on the construction of nature by "particular forms of government" to the recent "interest in questions of landownership" among romanticists inspired by the work of John BarreU (Romantic Ecology 15). In response to such questions, Bate wants to say that environmental peril transcends?and has outUved?po litical peril: it is as true now as it was before the faU of the Iron Curtain that for every Three M?e Island there is a Chernobyl.23 WeU, yes, the issue of ownership is long overdue for a rest; and Bate's repeated quotation of Edward Thomas' "lord of that he does not possess," together with his reminder that John Clare could write of dweUing itself as possession despite never having owned any property (see 100-101), make for a welcome change of tune. Not that these very citations could not eas?y be demystified as exceptions proving the hegemonic rule of proprietary figurations of home: the point is, despite this available rejoinder, that feelings which are 22. Trilling, The Liberal Imagination (New York: Anchor, 1953) 140. 23. For the obvious truth of this fact, with its non-Marxist implications, one need look no farther than the National Geographic for August 1994, with its gruesome article on pollution in the former U.S.S.R., "Lethal Legacy" (70-115). Interestingly, the lead article in this same issue, "England's Lake District," reflects Bate's Ruskinian view ofthat region: "Wordsworth called it 'a blended holiness of earth and sky.' Today this poetic rolling landscape receives 12 million visitors each year?and feels the strain" (1).</page><page sequence="10">544 PAUL H. FRY unquestionably in some sense proprietary (and not just the communist nationalism of "This land is my land" but the transitory sojourner's "This is my kind of place" are involved here) run deepest at the very moments when one is most conscious of exemption from the burdens of ownership. That is why people feel proprietary about public parks, "historic districts," and the like. When "man" (the word is H?lderlin's) dwells poetically, she is on someone else's property, even and most especially in those poems on country seats written by guests and beneficiaries of patronage that have been laid bare in successive critiques of pastoral from Raymond Williams to Annabel Patterson. To further complications of this issue we shall return in commenting on Wordsworth's Home at Grasmere. Bate's position, then, is the environmentalist position (its rallying-cry, as every first-grader knows, is the undeeded possessive "our planet"), and he wants to say that it is Wordsworth's position too?that for Wordsworth the only important thing about owning a cottage, in Home at Grasmere, is that it surrounds one with a "deep vale," a "concave" mirror image of the whole earth that can become a regional "haunt" in "the mind of man" (92, 40, 102). This position is certainly congenial to the much older author of The Guide to the Lakes, featured in Bate's second chapter, and congenial also to the tradition of British Wordsworth readers passing from the Ruskin of Fors Clavigera through William Morris to Edward Thomas and to Seamus Heaney (the name of John Berger might well be added) which Bate identifies as a genuinely left-leaning genealogy of literary Greens. (I think his patriotism justified, by the way. In most other countries environmen talism has been most typically a plank of rightist platforms and has served, not always by design, the interests of privileged classes, as is well docu mented in Anna Bramwell's Ecology in the 20th Century: A History, an extremely intelligent book which appears in most respects to shape Bate's understanding of the complex relation between environmentalism and politics.24) But Bate's position remains?to revert to my earlier distinc tion?a metaphysical view of nature, and fails to take into account how an ontological view might differ from it. "Wordsworth," in other words, is still at stake. To make my point as clear as possible, let me juxtapose two descriptions of a nuclear power plant against the backdrop of a seacoast. The first is Bate's, to the tune of "Wordsworth, thou should'st be with us at this hour": 24. (New Haven: Yale UP, 1989). In support of Bate's (and Bramwell's) celebration of a specifically British grasp of the politics of nature, elaborated in Bramwell's chapter called "Back to the Northland," one might add that during the vogue among intellectuals for mountain climbing in the early twentieth century, the typifying charismatic figure in England was the leftist journalist Michael Roberts, friend of Richards, Empson, and others, whereas in Germany the comparable figure was Leni Riefenstahl.</page><page sequence="11">THE NATURAL WORDSWORTH 545 If we ascend Coniston Old Man, the mountain beneath which Ruskin Uved in the years when he was writing Fors, the most prominent sight on the coast is the SeUafield nuclear reprocessing plant, with its abysmal record for dumping contaminated waste. "StiU gUdes the Stream, and shaU for ever gUde," wrote Wordsworth of the Duddon in his concluding sonnet; but now it is not only water that gUdes inexorably into the sea off Wordsworth's coast. (61) American readers can no doubt put hands on comparable descriptions of Seabrook on the coast of New Hampshire, juxtaposed perhaps with evo cations of Thoreau on the Merrimac. The real plangency of Bate's senti ment, expressed over against the odds Wordsworth wagered upon in the Duddon sonnet (unUke the late Ruskin, Wordsworth was evidently un troubled by environmental panic), consists in his distress at knowing that things don't stay the same. Thoughtless human beings tamper with the metaphysics, the AristoteUan "natural form," of nature's essence. It was not "meant" to have a power plant in it. The hanging in independent suspense of this "meant" ("it" means in the same way that "it" rains) is what shows us stiU to beUeve that "nature," with Wordsworth its prophet, is in fact intrinsicaUy meaningful, at once the subject and the object of human agency. But the amazingly ??-ecological, anthropocentric hubris of think ing human threats to planetary health too powerful for the earth to pass through and beyond, just as it has passed through catastrophes in which humans have played no part (not only the massive ones that changed the course of Uving forms but also such threats to species as rabies, elm bUght, and hemlock disease), can perhaps be humbled, and our burden lightened, by a more truly Wordsworthian kind of nature description. In the ontological view, things qua things do stay the same, they just may not be the same things. Ontic sameness, not this or that visible form, stays the same. Here is a passage from a recent detective novel by P. D. James. Having detailed a panorama that includes a ruined abbey, a v?lage, and a church as surveyed by her detective, Dalgleish, James continues: to the north the view was dominated by the huge bulk of the power station, the low-roofed administration block with, behind it, the reactor bu?ding and the great steel, aluminium-clad bu?ding of the turbine house. Four hundred metres out to sea were rigs and platforms of the intake structures through which the cooUng sea water passed to the pump house. . . .

FRY ignoring the sea. Farther inland . . . was the Old Rectory, set like a Victorian dolls' house. . . .25 History is welcome here, as is geography, each period and place jumbled together with its inharmonious characteristics, yet from flint to aluminum, it is implied, walls remain walls. Modes of dwelling, as of power (God, witchcraft, cosy imperial culture, nuclear energy) recirculate like coolant through a pump. The author revels in the mastery of detail (I have left out a lot), and while the passage is not without value judgments (the specific "nature" of objects as well as the mutuality derived from their very distinctness of being is emphasized), its overwhelming purpose is simply to place the discrete parts of the scene before the eye in their indiscriminate vividness. The nuclear power plant figures importantly in James's plot, just as it does in this panorama, but in both cases she carefully avoids aligning its role with either its messianic or its diabolical public images. Like Mont Blanc, it is a soulless image on the eye but no less for that reason a power source, timeless as power despite being a latecomer in the scenery. This is a "bleak headland," says James; it has the visionary dreariness of Words worth: a gibbet, a naked beacon, a girl with a pitcher making her way against the wind, all just unforgettably there together. That they are what they are is interesting, and suggestive, but strictly for the purpose of furnishing the ontological shock that makes them a spot of time, they could have been anything else: a road, a blasted crag, a tree, and a sheep, for example?anything, that is, in which an aestheticized symbolism of spiritual shelter and nurture, the hostelry of meaningfulness, has been effaced or carefully neutralized. Judging from the example of Bate, an environmentalist criticism is prone to conclude that description is valuable because the things it describes are those things, and somehow in fact depends for this value on their continued (and, for that matter, their past) real existence. Thus Bate on reading Keats's "To Autumn" once global warming has increased the severity of winds in northern Europe: "the swallow has the greatest difficulty in coping with wind. . . . The poem will look very different if there is soon an autumn when 'gathering swallows twitter in the skies' for the last time" (2). In addition to the bad ornithology entailed here in Bate's having forgotten that swallows don't just twitter when preparing for autumn migration but also twitter every evening, when returning to their barns and chimneys, from late spring until autumn (these are not idle facts but serve to com plicate Keats's already complex conclusion in important ways)?in addition to this there is also a deeper issue, touching on a matter that may be said to contradict even the bird-lore I have just supplied. Will the poem look 25- P. D. James, Devices and Desires (New York: Knopf, 1990) 61-62.</page><page sequence="13">THE NATURAL WORDSWORTH 547 very different in the sad aftermath of global warming? I think that, sup posing there is then anyone around to read it, the poem wiU in fact look much the same, or perhaps even better. The identity of the swaUows is not compromised in their real present existence, and certainly not in an exact description of their habits (though it is fostered by the impression of exactitude), but in their having been realized as a present existence; and this form of identity if anything would gain in poignancy, I am sorry to say, in ways foreseen by the poem itself, from the imposition of pastness by extinction. (Why does Bate speak of "the certainty of the foUowing spring's return" (2)? Isn't SheUey, insofar as even he is certain, writing about the need for a violent wind during that same autumn?) Just so, on the awful day when aU the trees are gone and we shaU finaUy be entitled to say, pace Liu, "there is no nature" (Sense of History 56), just then and not before, if we survive, we wiU realize, concerning what de Man caUed "the ontology of the poetic" in a passage cited by Bate (104), that poetry is an epitaph, not a landscape. Taking his turn with the Boy of Winander episode, Bate writes: "Let us not forget that it is . . . about a boy alone by a lake at dusk blowing mimic hootings to unseen owls. Which are there to answer him" (115). And then to stop.26 I should like once more to compare the position I have been taking with that of de Man on Wordsworth in order to show where I differ: The miracle of Wordsworth's figurai diction is that, by stating its own precariousness so to speak face to face, without aesthetic evasion, it recovers the totality of the phenomenal world of sky and earth and thus, in a deeper sense than any color or melody could achieve, recovers the aesthetic in the process of its refusal. (Rhetoric of Roman ticism 87) "Aesthetic" is a difficult, evermore important word in de Man's later work which I wiU not attempt to unravel. Here, though, clearly enough, it is aUgned with "totaUty," the Kantian "purposive, not purposeful" manifold which modern criticism caUs an "evasion" because it suspends historical engagement. The "refusal" de Man speaks of is Wordsworth's insistence that aU phenomenality without exception is in fact purpose/?/, while the return of the aesthetic is the aU-inclusiveness of this very insistence, making the realized phenomenal world a world-picture or song of the earth after aU. It seems to me that this aesthetic is after aU very close to an ecology, and results in a view of Wordsworth that surprisingly resembles Bate's. It turns, I believe, on the failure to distinguish between totality?the com 26. I ought to say that in Bate's best chapter, "The Naming of Places," there are touches of an ontological perspective. See for instance the fine description of "Michael" on 105.</page><page sequence="14">548 PAUL H. FRY prehensive manifold or "multeity in unity" dear to Coleridge of which, in my view, there is very little in Wordsworth?and unity, unity to which the presence or absence of multeity is immaterial, which I take to be Wordsworth's essential subject. Undoubtedly this is a fine point of distinction on which all too much may depend. Where, for example, does this eloquent passage in Whitehead, so impressively evocative of Wordsworth, fall between totality and unity? Of course he recognizes, what no one doubts, that in some sense livings things are different from lifeless things. But that is not his main point. It is the brooding presence in the hills which haunts him. His theme is nature ins?lido, that is to say, he dwells on that mysterious presence of surrounding things, which imposes itself on any separate element that we set up as an individual for its own sake.27 It falls, I would say, on the side of unity, the mysterious presence obtruding itself on the poet as the being of beings. Karl Kroeber, in a 1974 article called "'Home at Grasmere': Ecological Holiness" (PMLA 89) acknowl edged by Bate as his forerunner in the field, offers comparable conflations of terms that I am less confident of enlisting in my cause. He sees Wordsworth's indifference to environmental prettiness (the "natural beauty" that apparendy makes some eco-systems worthier than others) placed in the service of an all-embracing "ecological unity," or, again, of "wholeness," and that sounds like the return of the aesthetic in totality; but in saying that Wordsworth makes "the finest poetry out of the com monest and most everyday beingness, merely 'what we are,' " Kroeber, with his Native American-influenced perspective on dwelling in the presence of the inanimate, decidedly does not look forward to a "green" criticism. Indeed, perhaps it is finally a question whether the nature poetry of Wordsworth is green or gray; and critical insight should perhaps be com mended in proportion as it serves to remind us that "rocks and stones" make up two-thirds of the Wordsworthian cosmos, the other third being Lucy?"thing" that she once seemed and now is?and the trees.28 3 An offensive, in some ways authentically Thoreauvian article in the current Harvard Alumni Magazine shows very clearly what happens when environ 27- Alfred North Whitehead, Science and the Modem World (New York: Mentor, 1948) 80. 28.

In apparently total ignorance that his article is a humorless attack on the Great Unwashed, otherwise known as the American people, the author impUes that his "kayak eUte" is classless, as though the outdoorsy shabby gent?ity he evokes for his already-con verted audience were not the very essence of patrician, quiet-money New England. Of course outsiders can join this class, just as outsiders can rise or sink to any other American class, but the snobbery and exclusiveness of each and every class (the public beach crowd with its gas barbecues and aqua-socks is capable for its part of some pretty keen satire on the narrow Yankee soul) remains always the key sign of the false secondary power whereby we multiply distinctions. Hence although there have certainly been plenty of occasions on which what Bate caUs the "red" criticism of the 'eighties has been simply mal apropos, a breach of scale, there is one purpose for which it is evidently still needed, and that is the d?mystification of green criticism. Consider this startling distinction without a difference in Bate: Wordsworth's concern for the preservation of the Lakes has often been put down to a selfish desire to keep away artisan day trippers from Manchester. But in his 1844 letters to the Morning Post concerning the projected Kendal and Windermere Ra?way, Wordsworth's principal objection was to large-scale organized Sunday outings. ... It is pre cisely this problem of mass tourism that threatens the Lake District today. (Romantic Ecology 50) Indeed, by the 1840's, Wordsworth was an Environmentalist "considering," as Bate says, "the evolving and increasingly disruptive influence of man on his environment" (45) and more and more concerned to select his human and nonhuman company during the successive editions of the Guide to the Lakes that Bate documents. "Is then no nook of EngUsh ground secure / From rash assault?" he enquires in the sonnet pubUshed with his 1844 letters against the Kendal and Windermere Ra?way, ranging the "pausing travel ler" of his early poems and the smaU yeoman landowner with his "paternal fields" over against "the false utiUtarian lure" of mechanized mass tour 29.

FRY ism?including, needless to say, the artisan day trippers. Keep "nature" hard to reach, and only the right people will make themselves at home in it, leaving everyone else stranded in environmental limbo. By contrast, in Home at Grasmere, which is one of the relatively few early poems that Bate can have much to say about, Wordsworth says that it takes all kinds?"I came not dreaming of unruffled life, / Untainted manners" (MS. B, 428-29)?just as he honestly admits, in the same year, that even rustic language stands in need of bowdlerization. This more forgiving view points to inclusive unity rather than any subtly exclusive totalization ("aes thetization") of the natural. "Bleak season was it" when he and his entou rage arrived (218); he and Dorothy identify with a pair of swans that chose arbitrarily to live in Grasmere Vale despite lacking roots there and may have been shot?hard pastoral indeed!?by a thoughtless shepherd (see 322-56); the unself-consciousness of "sensation" and natural want among "untutored shepherds" is not "unhallowed" (see 665-72); and the spirit of levelling first noticed by Hazlitt here as elsewhere promotes ontic equality: I begin Already to inscribe upon my heart A liking for the small grey Horse that bears The paralytic Man; I know the ass On which the Cripple in the Quarry maimed Rides to and fro. (723-28) This is not the author of the Guide to the Lakes but the earlier poet moved by intimations of somatism, attending to the human creatures Alan Bewell has called "marginals"30 (in "Animal Tranquility and Decay," for instance), discovering and delineating the human by feeling tentatively around the edges of humanity in that moment of being, never far from bedrock, where death and life graze each other. That is the moment within which he imagines himself to be embraced in the much pawed-over first verse paragraph of "Tintern Abbey," and indeed in the whole poem ("If I should be where I no more can hear / Thy voice"). This moment calls, in my view, for a criticism that is neither red nor green but gray, not dull gray but gleaming at times the way rocks, depending how you look at them, gleam at times. The "soft inland murmur," the thought of "more deep seclusion," the poet's "repose" under a dark tree from which he can view other "plots"?these are indications that the speaker is on the extreme verge of life, which is also of course to say (and here red criticism pounces) of social existence.

It is here that, "the breath of this corporeal frame / And even the motion of our human blood / Almost suspended, we are laid asleep / In body" (43-46). The burthen of the mystery is not explained, Wordsworth never says that it was or is; he only says that it is "Ughtened," meaning that in the ontic moment it no longer seems to matter that the world is "uninteUigible." Or so the "ph?osophic calm" of Wordsworth's nature poetry appears, in any case, from the standpoint of a stone-colored criticism. Yale University</page></plain_text>
