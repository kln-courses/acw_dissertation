GUIDA Abstract: This article presents the archaeological evidence of administrative technologies from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age in the Kopet Dagh piedmont (Southern Turkmenistan). We review the relevant published finds (different types of tokens, seals, sealings) including in the discussion some new stone tokens and an early 'amulet stamp', found in our 1999 survey of the Middle Chalcolithic site of Ilgynly-depe. The record of tokens is abundant but quite discontinuous, and there are no bullae or tablets to support that here administration followed a path similar to that hypothesized for Mesopotamia and Iran. In the second half of the 4th millennium BCE 'amulet-stamps' with eccentric suspension holes changed into stamp seals with similar geometric patterns, but with a couple of holes in the centre. We try to explain this change as a by-product of the evolution of local administrative systems. Résumé : Cet article présente les témoignages archéologiques de techniques administratives du Néolithique à l'âge du Bronze au pied du Kopet Dagh (Turkménistan méridional). Nous passons en revue les découvertes publiées significatives (différents types de jetons, sceaux, empreintes), en intégrant de nouveaux jetons de pierre et un « cachet-amulette », trouvés en 1999 lors de notre prospection sur le site d'Ilgynly-depe, daté du Chalcolithique moyen. Le nombre de jetons est important, mais ces derniers présentent une répartition discontinue et il n'y a ni bulla ni tablette pour affirmer qu'ici l'administration a suivi un parcours semblable à celui qui est supposé pour la Mésopotamie et l'Iran. Dans la seconde moitié du 4e millénaire avant notre ère, les «cachets-amulettes» sont transformés en sceaux ornés de motifs géométriques semblables, mais avec deux perforations centrales. Nous tentons d'expliquer ce changement comme un sous-produit de l'évolution des systèmes administratifs locaux. Keywords: Southern Turkmenistan; Tokens; Seals; Ancient administration.

INTRODUCTION Many, at present, agree that the southern Turkmenian pied mont was a primary civilization focus, even though the genetic relationships between the early western agricultural practices and the development of farming and herding along the Kopet Dagh piedmont (fig. 1) are far from ascertained (Harris 2010). The available chronology and cultural phases adopted in this article are detailed in Table 1. However, the technical nature and the role of informa tion recording technologies of the region are still very poorly known. Looking to the broader picture of Middle Asia, the invention of writing systems, simultaneously occurring in Southern Mesopotamia and the south-western Iranian Plateau in the last centuries of the 4th millennium BCE, was the final output of three millennia of administrative skills developed since the Neolithic. According to the most structured theories, across the Plateau these technologies evolved through the use of tokens, different types of stamp seals, bullae and cylinder seals often used with 'proto-Elamite' type tablets (Schmandt Besserat 1974 and 1992; Sampson 1985; Nissen et al. 1993; Englund 1998; Hessari 2011). The trajectory of administrative systems along the Kopet Dag piedmont may have been quite different. In fact, even though Neolithic sites in Southern Turkmenistan show a Paléorient, vol. 40.1, p. 55-71 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2014 Manuscrit reçu le 22 janvier 2013, accepté le 13 décembre 2013</page><page sequence="2">56 G.L.

Nor such possible local accounting technologies ever debouched, in the 4th millennium BCE, through numerical tablets and bullae to formalized standard writing:1 the Kopet Dagh at the time was an effective north-eastern boundary to the diffusion of the Uruk-related ceramic complexes and to the so-called Proto Elamite inscribed tablets. Southern Turkmenistan is an independent testing bench for some of D. Schmandt-Besserat's influential and controversial views, often criticized by assyriologists, and generally accepted by archaeologists. Criticism to her paradigm includes a percep tion of arbitrariness in her equating solid tokens and Sumerian graphic signs (similarity alone, given the simplicity of the signs, is not enough to advocate unilinear evolution); the evident abstract meaning of many early signs is difficult to reconcile with material objects. Her opponents would rather limit the his torical linkage between tokens and later symbols to the numeral systems (Sampson 1985: 59-60). Therefore a closer look to the record of tokens in this civilization core area may be useful. 1. But see the artefact discussed in the Appendix 1 of this article.

The elusive symbolic meanings of their patterns were part of the same systems. By impressing a seal upon a plastic clay label applied onto a closed container or space, the holder signified his or her authorization or witnessing of a transaction, the movement of goods and/or information from one person, or from an economic or administrative unit to another (Ferioli et al. 1979; Ferioli and Fiandra 1983; Pittman 1994; Fiandra and Pepe 2000; Perna 2005). The introduc tion of seals not only indirectly reflects the expansion of the local production systems in terms of labour, storage and extra somatic permanent memory, but also displayed economic and/ or political control or straight personal ownership. Ultimately, as seals soon became status symbols, the holders could distin guish themselves from the individuals, the bulk, who did not possess them, while their incised patterns conveyed pervasive ideographic symbolism (Cool Root 2005). What is the archaeological evidence and which were the possible roles of tokens in the Neolithic and Chalcolithic soci eties of Southern Turkmenistan? How old exactly are the earli est seals and sealing technologies along the piedmont? Was there any relationship between the use of tokens and the intro duction of stamp sealing of clay tags? TOKENS AND THEIR USE IN THE SOCIAL EVOLUTION OF SOUTHERN TURKMENISTAN The use of pebbles and similar objects to count and record quantities of goods has a long but scarcely investigated pre historic past (Menninger 1977: 297). Tokens, in most cases, were made of clay, and this is why the less common stone specimens recorded in different Near-Eastern and Middle Asian sites might point to early status distinctions (see below). In early excavation reports, archaeologists had interpreted tokens as amulets, gaming pieces, fiches or simply enigmatic objects. The oldest tokens of the Near East date to the 8th and 7th millennia BCE.2 P. Amiet (1972: 69) first became aware of their function in the bullae or envelopes of the 4th millennium BCE from the site of Susa. In Darestan (Eastern Iran), more recently, were found large aceramic sites with unbaked clay tokens in form of spheres, disks, cones, realistic reproduction of figs and tiny animal figurines, sometimes with impressed numerical marks (Garazhian 2009; personal comm.). From Anatolia and the Levant to Baluchistan, a flex ible system of counting and record keeping of goods became necessary with the introduction of domesticated and stored cereals, and growing techno-economical investments in ani mal breeding and secondary productions (dairy and textiles) became crucial concerns.3 Even more complex tokens, deco rated with lines, punctuate motives and appliqué markings, appeared in the 5th and 4th millennia BCE, from the Middle Chalcolithic to V.G. Childe's "urban revolution", stressing that the development of information storage techniques coincided with major socio-economic developments (Frangipane 2004). In this period, tokens were also deposited in burials, where their symbolic role or function is presumable but more difficult to explain: at Hajji Firuz (Voigt 1983), Tepe Guran (Mortensen 1964), Arpachijah (Mallowan and Cruikshank Rose 1933), Tell es-Sawwan (Schmandt-Besserat 1992) and Tepe Gawra (Tobler 1950). Such tokens were apparently restricted to high status burials, some of which richly furnished. Table 2 sum marizes location, contexts and variability of the tokens so far found in Southern Turkmenistan and in two key related sites of North-Eastern Iran: Tepe Sialk and Tepe Hissar. The earliest tokens were found in the Late Mesolithic lev els of Belt Cave or Gar-i Kamarband (Northern Iran, about 8 km west of Behshahr, some 15 km from the Caspian Sea: see Coon 1951: 75).4 A second and more substantial group was 2.

See also Cauvin 1978, and Atalay 2005 for new information from Çatal Höyük. 3. See for discussion Schmandt-Besserat 1994: 23; the author thinks that tokens had little to do with animal domestication and herding, or with the rise of trade. In the third occupational level of Mureybet III tokens appear together with a quantum jump in quantity of cereal pollen in the soil (the first evidence for the cultivation of grain in fields around the site), the construction of rectangular storage bins, and a substantial increase in the population, implying a new social structure. Their use thus would be mainly related to cultivating hoarding cereals and with the ensuing social changes. 4. We have no drawings, nor pictures of these artefacts. In the words of the excavator "[...] From Levels 11 and 12 come five mysterious unbaked coni cal clay objects, looking like nothing in the world but suppositories. What they were used for is anyone's guess. They show, at least, a Mesolithic interest in clay". Paléorient, vol. 40.1, p. 55-71 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2014</page><page sequence="4">58 G.L. BONORA, M.

XL and XLI; Berezkin 1992b: 25-27, fig. 4). Jeitun is the only exca vated site in the region where the spatial distribution of tokens vs. architecture gives some information. If we compare (somehow forcedly) the southern Turkmenian evidence with the later western contexts of Hajji Firuz, Tepe Gawra and Uruk, in these latter centres tokens were clearly associated to larger non-domestic architectural compounds,6 suggesting that there important transactions were carried on by the elites in political or religious enclaves. In contrast, there is no factual evidence of a preferential or more frequent use of tokens in the special socio-religious 'clan-houses' of the Middle and Late Neolithic of Southern Turkmenistan.7 At Jeitun, in fact, half of the tokens with a precise location (23 out of 47, three in stone) were found in courtyards or in narrow open-spaces aside one-roomed houses. Fourteen tokens were found within houses and nine (one of which in stone) in other constructions and storage facilities. The information collected is too small to state that this is sim ply a dumping pattern, or support that tokens were used for small-scale transactions within the open common spaces like courtyards and streets, or in the storerooms where they were kept before being finally lost or discarded. Of course, we can not exclude the possible use of these small objects in games, divination or other magic/religious activities. At present, we have to assume the possibility that the 'Jeitun-system' included a flexible accounting technology based upon such small indicators, and that the Middle Neolithic of the Kopet Dagh was linked, also from this viewpoint, to the developments of the south-west. But in this case these accounting practices might have been less centralized than usually observed in Mesopotamia. It is certain, however, that unbaked and baked clay tokens of few basic forms (cone, truncated-cone, cylinder-cone, elon gated cone, bi-cone; later, sphere and disks) became more fre quent through the Late Neolithic and the Early Chalcolithic. Unfortunately, little is known about the important group of 56 tokens from Anau north, excavated by R. Pumpelly in 1904 (not mentioned in his Explorations in Turkestan).8 In later contexts, tokens will get more and more confused within the inventories of a material culture that gets richer, more varied and increas ingly difficult to identify and to interpret.9 Nonetheless, in the following Middle Chalcolithic or Namazga (hereafter NMG) II period, although only few tokens are mentioned in the exca vation reports, they are flanked by an increasing evidence of stone seals and their sealing on clay, a process that probably mirrors a growing control exerted on crucial aspects of the local early urban economies. Possible old and new evidence and indicators of administrative practices need to be discussed in the more general frame of the social evolution of the local societies. SOCIAL HIERARCHIES IN THE FOURTH MILLENNIUM BCE From the southern shores of the Caspian Sea to the lower Tedjen river valley, the 4th millennium BCE witnessed impor tant changes for the local towns and villages, with multi roomed residential buildings and farming the land by means of artificial irrigation. Ekin-depe, Kara-depe, Namazga-depe, Ulug-depe, Altyn-depe, Ilgynly-depe, and possibly Geoksyur, seats of extensive demographic aggregation, had the earliest truly monumental buildings and defensive structures. The main centres ranged in size from 10 to 20 ha; they may have hosted some thousands inhabitants, and apparently had a con trol radius of 20-30 km (fig. 1). The rest were probably small rural villages, each settled by a few families (Bonora and Vidale 2013). At a regional level, each community shared a basic cultural uniformity (styles of pottery and lithics, pyrotechnology). Residential architecture suggests that extended, kin-related families lived in multi-roomed complexes of about 6 to 10 6. For example, of the 778 tokens recovered from Uruk, 685 come from the sacred precinct of the goddess Inanna, 43 from the Anu temple and only 50 from the city's private quarters. But these estimates could be heavily biased by the relative percentage of excavated deposits from the different settlement areas (Schmandt-Besserat 1992: 49-73). 7. See Room 12,in the middle Jeitun layers ofPessedjik-depe(Berdyev 1968; Lollekova 1978) and Room 12 in the late Jeitun layers of Chagylly-depe (Berdyev 1966). At Pessedjik-depe, the building had massive walls, a floor paved with alabaster and large wall paintings, but was totally void of utilitarian goods. There is no information on what was found in the 'clan house' of Chagylly-depe. 8. But see Schmandt-Besserat 1992: 35 and 40. 9. For example, see the objects from Dashlidji-depe, described by S. A. Semenov (in Masson 1961c: 62) as "[...] fiches of some ancient game". In the 1976 restudy project at Tepe Hissar, together with half a dozen clay cones from layers 8 and 7, DF 88/89, South Hill, were found two doubtful fragments of impressed bullae (H 76-92 and H 76-98), and a pierced "label" (H 76-122), sealed twice with a stamp seal and bearing some signs (Tosi and Bulgarelli 1989: fig. 6). To the same period belong a stone truncated-conical artefact in hematite (H 1722), a two-horned object in baked clay (H 3670) and a possible human terracotta figurine (H 3735). Establishing if these and other artefacts were labels and tokens used in administration is really uneasy. Another doubtful tool or token and some "game pieces" in baked clay, limestone and stone come from Period III (Schmidt 1937: H 1687, H 2274, H 1806, H 4086, H 4097).

The use in cen tral settlements of costly and prestigious metal ornaments in copper, silver and gold (Salvatori et al. 2009) might confute previous egalitarian interpretations proposed for a long time and point, in contrast, to a growing degree of social differ entiation. However, the archaeological record of this process still remains ambiguous, both in settlements and in cemeteries. These latter, in the second half of the 4th and early 3rd millennia BCE, contain individual and collective graves with primary and secondary burials (for example at Altyn-depe, Kara-depe, Geoksyur l10 and also Ilgynly-depe, if the preliminary infor mation in Masson et al. 1994 is confirmed). Interestingly, the richest or well furnished graves belong to infants and children, as if status and differential access to important symbols, made of valuable base materials, were inherited or ascribed at birth on kinship, and not individually achieved in life; the contra diction between "egalitarian" graves for adults and "ranked" burials for children—not fully developed social personae— may be explained as a compromise between traditional ethics and emerging social stratification (Bonora and Vidale 2013). The multi-rooms complexes and the collective burials might have been used by the same type of kinship units, because both almost totally disappeared in the 3rd millennium BCE, when they are replaced by smaller dwellings and simpler (even though often richer) individual graves. NEW SURFACE FINDS AT ILGYNLY-DEPE: STONE TOKENS AND A STAMP SEAL Ilgynly-depe (36°48'54" N; 60°29'26" E) is the most important Chalcolithic site of the Meana - Chaacha region, the easternmost piedmont plain north of the Kopet Dagh ridge (Southern Turkmenistan) (fig. I).11 Its upper deposits and eroded surfaces are dated to the middle of the 4th millennium BCE and to the following centuries, i.e., to the late phase of the Middle Chalcolithic (NMG II) or the early phase of the Late Chalcolithic (NMG III) horizons.12 Ilgynly-depe was evidently a crucial site,13 with high standards of craft skill (Berezkin 1989 and 1992a; Berezkin and Solovyova 1998; Solovyova 2000 and 2005; Salvatori et al. 2009). Among the finds, there are copper, silver and gold items (Solovyova et al. 1994; Salvatori et al. 2009), manufactured with specialistic tools (icontra Korobkova 1988, based upon use traces on lithics); human and animal figurines in terracotta (Khlobystina 1977; Masson and Korobkova 1989; Antonova und Sarianidi 1990; Solovyova 2005; Kasparov 2000 and 2001); larger human images in limestone, sandstone and bubbly basalt (Korobkova 1987; Bonora and Vidale 2013) and hundreds of terracotta and stone spindle-whorls. Abundant stone tools, containers and weights, production rejects and waste imply an important stone-working centre (Korobkova and Sharovskaya 1994). Elaborate buildings with wall paintings and benches were in the past interpreted as sanctuaries. Important craft activities might have linked the local economies to the growing amount of goods exchanged across the Kopet Dagh with the contem porary centres of the Iranian Plateau, more directly impacted by the much discussed "Uruk phenomenon" and the ensuing "Proto-Elamite expansion" (e.g., Hessari 2011). Four stone tokens (fig. 2-6) were collected in spring 1999 on the surface of Igynly-depe by the authors on the south-eastern slopes, during a survey carried out jointly by the Turkmenian State University (Ashgabad) and the former IsIAO (Rome). 10.

The site was discovered in 1929 by A. A. Semenov. In his unpublished note Drevnosti Meycheneyskogo rayona - Antiquities of the Meycheney region, the site is mentioned as Kosha-depe (literally, 'double depe'). 12. For Semenov, Ilgynly and the Late Neolithic site of Anau, northern mound (Pumpelly 1908), were coeval. In 1935, A. Maruschenko dated it to the Anau II or Namazga II period (hereafter NMG II). In 1951, the site was visited again by S. A. Erschov and in the following year by B. A. Kuftin, of the XIV Brigade of JuT.A.K.E. In 1953, digs by G. A. Ganjalin (1959) linked Ilgynly-depe with Anau I-II of Pumpelly's original columns, without reaching the virgin soil. Between 1960 and 1980, Ilgynly-depe was explored intensively, but not systematically, and several test trenches were never published. Between 1985 and 1999, the mound was dug by the Kara-Kum Archaeological Expedition of the Institute for the History of Material Culture of Saint-Petersburg (IIMK), headed first by V. M. Masson and then by Yu. Berezkin and N. Solovyova (Berezkin 1989; Masson 1989 and 1992). Many other small trenches were dug on top (see the locations in Salvatori et al. 2009: Fig. 2). According to Masson (1989), the upper layers of excavation 3 contain Geoksyur-type pottery (beginning of the Late Chalcolithic or NMG III), while the lowermost part of the third horizon already contained Jalangach-type sherds and other artefacts of the Middle Chalcolithic (NMG II). The same context is confirmed by excavations 2 and 5. Here, at the north, Early Chalcolithic levels (NMG I) encompass the lower 3.5 m or arbitrary cuts XVI-X (Ganjalin 1959). 13. Five other prehistoric sites were found in the region: Altyn-depe (Masson 1988; Masson and Berezkin eds. 2005; Kircho et al. 2008), about 7 km to the north-west of Ilgynly; the Neolithic, Proto- and Early Chalcolithic site of Mondjukli-depe (Berdyev 1972), about 7.5 km to the north-west; the Middle and Late Neolithic site of Chagylly-depe (Berdyev 1964 and 1966), 3.5 km westwards; and Chakmakli-depe (Berdyev 1968 and 1976) containing Proto- and Early Chalcolithic layers, about 2.8 km to the west south-west. At Gadymi Depe (Lollekova 1982 and 1988), in the valley of the Chaachachay stream, Middle Neolithic layers were found, but the mound could not be excavated down to the virgin soil because of its criti cal location near the Iran-Turkmenistan international border.

Morello). These artefacts, used in the region since the Neolithic, are reported for the first time at Ilgynly-depe. Although we can not exclude that these tokens were used as game-pieces, they might have been used in administration. Similar stone tokens in a late 4th millennium BC grave at Kara-depe (table 1) may suggest that professional administrators or bureaucrats were already active in the Late Chalcolithic period. The materials we present are listed as follows: - a cone-like token in a greyish calcitic rock with white fossil inclusions (fig. 3): IS 1005; height: 2.75 cm; diam. at the base: 1.4 to 1.9 cm; - a cylinder-conical token with concave sides (fig. 4): IS 1047, one half preserved; height: 1.7 cm; diam. at the base: 2.1 cm; - a conical limestone token (fig. 5): IS 1049; height: 3.4 cm; diam. at the base: 1.7-1.8 cm; - another cone-like token, slightly damaged, from the south-eastern slopes of the site (fig. 6): IS 1053, pre served height: 2.5 cm; diam. at the base: 1.4 cm. The peculiar form of IS 1047 is similar to a class of stone artefacts dating back to the 6th - 5th millennia BCE that in other contexts were classified as labrets (see for example Hole et al. 1969: 235-237, 256). The other three objects are probably unfinished or abandoned as defective, as revealed by large abrasion scars and by grinding facets along their contour, sug gesting local manufacturing; - a fragment of a fine stamp seal (fig. 7-8, details in figs. 9-11): IS 1012, which measures 1,8 x 1 x 0,4 cm. Details of the incised pattern, observed at SEM (fig. 9-10), suggest the use of a single copper burin-like tool with a sharp point (the parallel grooves are ca 0.3-0.4 mm wide, and with a smooth, concave section). The hole at the corner seems to have been drilled with a stone tapered drill-head (irregular concentric tracks, later smoothed by the friction of a string in the cen tre: fig. 11). The seal had originally a rhomboid shape. It had slightly concave sides and was pierced in a corner. A symme tric four-armed cross was carved in the centre. Between the arms there were four small incised triangles, three of which accompanied by adjacent triangles, while one is flanked by the passing-by suspension hole. The eccentric hole was broken by the wear of the string. In terms of shape and typology—the material and carving—this seal fits very well with those so far published in Late Chalcolithic sites of Southern Turkmenistan. However, its slightly concave sides are unknown in other Late Chalcolithic sites of Middle Asia. Dated to late NMG II or early NMG III horizons, it is contemporary with a terracotta rectangular seal found in the same site by Ju. Berezkin in exca vation 4 (L. Kircho, personal comm.), with a passing-by hole in the middle of a short side, with two incised lines along the longer sides and a inner crossing diagonal lines. It was recently published by Kircho (2008a: Fig. 4, 26; 2008b) as an "amulet stamp seal", supposedly having no practical, ornamental or magic-religious functions. L. Kircho and other searchers believe that earliest seals of Southern Turkmenistan evolved from amulets or ornaments worn at the neck or at the wrist. Similar stamps would have been more decorative than functional: closely kept as personal posses sions, they originally symbolized individuality and identity, and became tokens of legal property and authority only later. This interpretation actually mirrors the opinions of E. E. Herzfeld, E. A. Speiser and A.J. Tobler on the evolution of Ubaid-Uruk stamp seals in Mesopotamia: the early seals had developed from buttons or pendants that eventually became ownership marks (see discussion and quotations in Khatchadourian 2005: 23). These seals were introduced in Southern Turkmenistan around the mid 4th millennium BCE, when the first stamps came in use in Mehrgarh (Northern Baluchistan), and perhaps a few centu ries before similar objects appeared in the Indus Valley (Jarrige etal. 1995; Durrani 1981; 1988 and 1994-1995; Allchin et al. 1986; Khan et al. 2000; Frenez in press).

The typical irregular grooves left by a chert drill look covered by the wear caused by the friction of the suspension string. Meadow (2001) published a single bone stamp fragment found in the Ravi phase, dated ca 3300 BCE (personal comm.). The rest of the early seals from Harappa is ascribed to the Kot-Dijan or Harappa II period (ca 2800-2600 BCE). The 'amulets-stamps' of Southern Turkmenistan were replaced by improved seals at the end of the 4th millennium BCE only, when also appeared the first cylinders (see a seal ing from Altyn-depe, room 7A of the Altyn 9 level, excava tion 5). Other seals with eccentric suspension holes were found at Kara-depe, Geoksyur 1 and the Geoksyur delta area, and Altyn-depe, all from the Late Chalcolithic or NMG III period. Evidence is summarized in Table 3, where the last entries are the later seals bearing a couple of passing holes in the centre of the artefact, thus resembling buttons. The designs of all these seals are repetitive and stress a codified uniformity, rather than individual traits. The new Ilgynly seal bears a local version of a wide class of simple motifs, which, in Western Asia, was labelled "Cross with chev ron-filled quadrants" (Rempel 2005). Interestingly, J. Rempel links these cross patterns to the "sheep" token (crossed circle) of the Mesopotamian world, and in a wider perspective to a large group of elegant and elaborated designs which appear on the pottery of Susa I and other sites of South-Western Iran. Similarly, as observed by V. M. Masson and L. Kircho, the patterns incised or excised on the earliest Turkmenian stamp seals are structurally (if not graphically) very similar to black dark brown or dark reddish designs on the ceramics of the Kara lb archaeological horizon at Kara-depe and Geoksyur, in the eastern Tedjen delta. They also look quite similar to the slightly later seals of the Quetta valley, in North-Eastern Baluchistan (Masson 1961b: Fig. 12; Frenez in press).

All this might fit well also, although in new forms, the southern Turkmenian evidence. The bone seal from Altyn-depe is the earliest example of this second type. At Altyn-depe (Masson and Berezkin eds. 2005), Altyn 9 is the latest level of the Late Chalcolithic period. A very similar seal was found on the surface at Shahr-i Sokhta in Iranian Sistan (Tusa 1977) and another one, prob ably later, came from Phase 5B levels of the garbage dump in square NXK (Salvatori and Vidale 1997: fig. 254, 4), dated around 2600 BCE. The cross cut in the centre, forming four spaces filled with other incisions, is common in the stamp seals from Tepe Hissar, Period I (end of the 5th - first half of the 4th millennium BCE). However, at Tepe Hissar there are no exam ples of the same button-like types (Schmidt 1933: pl. XCI; see also Bennett 1989). Table 4 summarizes the available information on clay sealings in the prehistory of the piedmont. There are no seal impressions contemporary with the two early seals found at llgynly-depe, as all the finds belong to Late Chalcolithic (NMG III) contexts. The rarity of these finds remains a pend ing question. Seals might have been used to close doors, jars and perhaps cloth bags, but the published documentation is too poor to support the inference. CONCLUSION The archaeological evidence so far published on the Neolithic and Chalcolithic of Southern Turkmenistan is cer tainly affected by the quality of data recovery. Some pub lished digs are quite reliable (for example the work at Jeitun and Altyn-depe by Masson, and later at this latter site by Kircho or at llgynly-depe by N. Solovyova).

Field experience shows that if sealings are not casually fired, or one does not specifically look for them, they may be easily lost or destroyed in the pro cess of digging, washing and later storage. The Chalcolithic layers at Altyn-depe, Ulug-depe and Namazga-depe are cov ered with tons of Bronze Age layers, that prevent large-size exposure. Last but not least, the functional interpretation of tokens is always uncertain, as it may overlap with other and quite different spheres of activity. This probably explains the partial and slight picture we have so far outlined. Tokens may have been used for count ing and recording by hunters and gatherers since the Early Holocene, and there is good evidence, at least at Jeitun, that they were also used by the earliest agriculturalists and herders of the region. Stone tokens, perhaps signalling a superior rank, were soon in use (at the same time, we cannot exclude that such stone items were also used in other ways). Large numbers of these objects are mentioned, but not properly studied, in Early Chalcolithic settlements such as Anau north and Dashlidji depe (see table 1). Here, in the 5th millennium BCE, tokens circulated in about a dozen of basic forms—a variety non com parable with what is recorded in archaic Mesopotamian con texts—including horned specimens perhaps used for counting cattle or goats. New horned tokens were probably invented in the frame of an expanding management of herds and interac tion with nomadic pastoralists. In the Middle Chalcolithic or NMG II period, at Kara depe, few stone specimens appear in a comparatively well to-do grave, possibly signalling the status of a manager or accountant. This evidence might fit with Schmandt-Besserat's remark (1994: 20) that: "[...] the rarity of funerary tokens, their association with luxurious burial deposits, with artifacts symbolizing power and with special architecture, seems to indicate that the counters did not belong to the masses, but were the privilege of an elite". On the other hand, we cannot exclude that tokens were deposited together with wooden, perishable gaming boards, like those found at Shahr-i Sokhta in grave of Period III, ca 2400 BC (Piperno and Salvatori 1982). The production at Ilgynly-depe of stone tokens, together with the long inventory of stone ornaments, tools and symbolic objects listed above, would anyhow confirm that the local elites had a specific concern for these possible accounting tools.

BONORA, M. VIDALE, M. Mariottini and G. Guida Like in more ancient sites, the lack of well preserved and excavated contexts makes impossible to address the question of the functional relationships between tokens and the intro duction of formal sealing practices. However, as stated above, there is no evidence that accounting information was ever transferred to permanent storage on clay tablets or envelopes. Economic interaction, to a large extent, was still performed along personal acquaintance, expedient political alliances and kinship ties, which made unnecessary any advanced technique of external memory storage. When the earliest seals appeared in Southern Turkmenistan, ca 3500-3200 BCE, they were fully evolved, both in form and functions. The traditional label of 'amulet-stamp seal' is dic tated by the dogma that before the 'Urban revolution' of the second half of the 3rd millennium BCE the piedmont societies were clusters of egalitarian tribes. There is no need to hypoth esize a priori that the early stamps had non functional, magical or purely symbolic values. The sealings did imply stamping on clay closures. Unfortunately, the evidence does not enable inferences on the precise function, breakage and storage tech nologies of the sealings. Thus at present, it is impossible to get archaeological sense from a comparison between the Kopet Dagh administrative practices to Mesopotamian standards. The early stamps, like later seals, were worn at the neck or at the wrist on a thread. The marginal hole made the hanging seals very fragile objects; the specimen presented in this paper was broken at the perforated tip. This quite unpractical choice would be explained if seals hanged like pendants, the stamp and its pattern fully visible by onlookers. In contrast, the 3rd millennium BCE stamps (like the so-called button-seals), tied through two central holes, besides being more resistant to wear and mechanical stress, might have been used without necessar ily displaying their incised patterns. What might have changed between 3500 and 3000 BCE is the social context of use. The early seals were subject of a greater general control, as the pat terns had to be always in sight, while later seals might have been used without necessarily being kept in full view (i.e., continuously visible by onlookers). This might imply the transition from administrative func tions in which individuals were not fully familiar with the others, to occasions in which people acted as a homogeneous group, where containers were sealed and opened by persons who knew each other and everybody's role. In this perspective, the change would be from groups or institutions which inter acted with the exterior, to expanded systems whose operative contexts where larger groups collaborating in the same activi ties. However, it is clear that the same change might imply a growth in the hierarchical organization of the administra tive technologies (more people collaborating in the consecu tive stages of the administrative steps, a default control being exerted by the institutional contexts and personal acquain tance) as well as lower degree of hierarchy (decreasing levels of social control). Are we over-interpreting the data? Probably yes, but only new and better excavated contexts might solve this and propose other intriguing questions. Tokens and seals continued to be used across the later Chalcolithic and Bronze age, but if the record of seals is abundant and gets more varied across the 3rd millennium BCE (Masson 1988) tokens become quite elusive, being con fused with other artefacts. Large-scale excavations and better recovery techniques have revealed a general use of unbaked clay tokens and other related finds in other settlements of the 3rd millennium BCE of Middle Asia. For example, at Shahr-i Sokhta, where the dry buried micro-environments are opti mal for the preservation of unbaked clay objects, besides the "Proto-Elamite" tablet of the end of the 4,h millennium BCE (Amiet and Tosi 1978), and the abundant clay sealings impressed with stone and metal seals (Ferioli et al. 1979; Fiandra and Pepe 2000; Tosi 1983), there are several tally disks (Cattini 2000), elongated pellets, perforated and grooved disks, spheres, cones, bi-cones, besides stone 'game pieces' or possibly counters, showing the persistence or the functional specialization of this archaic mode of managing information. In Margiana, clay tokens might have been used until the begin ning of the 2nd millennium BC, as suggested by a hoard of 26 of these objects, perhaps bearing numeral signs, was found by V. Sarianidi in a room near the entrance of the Palace of Gonur North (Sarianidi 1998: Fig. 41). APPENDIX 1: A NUMERICAL OR IMPRESSED TABLET AT ALTYN-DEPE ? While, as stated above, no bulla or similar artefacts have been so far discovered in the 4th millennium sites of Southern Turkmenistan, a possible numerical tablet might have been discovered at Altyn-depe. Published by Kircho (2008b: pi. 94, 2) with the caption "imprint of a seal (?)", it was found in room 18 of excavation 5, level Altyn 11, dated back to the early NMG III period. Although this artefact (fig. 12), being completely isolated, is admittedly very doubtful, it looks formally rather similar to the more refined and clearly nume rical impressed tablets found in contemporary contexts at Uruk, Habuba Kabira and Jebel Aruda. This identification, at present, is doubtful and has been considered with scepticism by the excavator, L. Kircho.

APPENDIX 2: ARCHEOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE BASE MATERIALS OF THE TOKENS AND SEAL Aside the graphic documentation and formal description of the artefacts so far discussed, we enclose an analytical identification of the base materials, aided by XRD analysis and/or thin section exami nation at the mineralogical microscope. This information might be useful, in future, for reconstructing the strategies of exploitation and patterns of distributions of the involved categories of ornamental stones. - Token in greyish calcitic stone, IS 1005, fig. 3. A thin sec tion shows long sheet-like crystals with strong birefringence and irregular contact surfaces. The crystals are often 3-4 mm large. The carbonatic mass has a limited porosity and a dense pigmentation of tiny carbonaceous particles. Fine veins (from 5 to 800 |i) cross orthogonally the crystals. It is a compact calcareous 'rythmite' cut along its natural fibrous structure, abrading the cone along parallel rotation planes which fol lowed its regular veins. - Alabaster' token IS 1047, fig. 4. The material is translucent and fibrous carbonatic rock, with coarse grains of spatic ivory white calcite. The rock has a rhombohedral cleavage. In sec tion we notice columnar structures (&lt; 5 mm) with sheet-like crystals, and equi-inclined twinning along their herringbone like contacts. The groundmass has an abundant, very fine black organic component. The cone was ground along the axis of the rock's fibrous structures. - Limestone token IS 1049, fig. 5. It was obtained from a white, compact crystalline limestone, with inner bands and mot tlings of a pure carbonatic material. The rock has a mosaic like texture with rare sparitic crystals (diameter &lt; = 1.4 mm) and limited cleavage. The turbid groundmass contains anhe dral calcite with twinning due to stretching. A micritic frac tion (maximum 15%) appears on the inner walls of the pores. Sparitic grains (diameter = 800 (X) are euhedral and pseudo rhombic. Dissolution and re-crystallization heavily affected the primary structures of the original rock. - Conical token made of dolomite, IS 1053, fig. 6. Thin sections reveal a dolomitic mosaic with turbid grains of variable size (MGS 700 |i), a xenotypic structure with rhomboid forms and rhombohedric cleavage. The groundmass is opaque due to iron oxides, with limited porosity and pockets of secondary calcite. XRD patterns confirm that calcite is a secondary com ponent (&lt; 10%). It is a fossil coral from a dolomitic formation, probably dating to the lurassic, scarcely affected by tectonic processes with a limited de-dolomitization. A similar token made with a fossil coral was found at Cafer Höyük (Turkey) in a PPNB context (Cauvin 1997: Fig. 43, 5). - The seal fragment IS 1012, Figs. 7 and 8, is made with a red brownish stone (5YR 3/3), compact and homogeneous, with concoidal fractures, soft and easy to work. A thin section of a tiny flake of the seal (ca 3 mm2) shows a compact ferruginous groundmass, with abundant, minute microgranules. However, XRD patterns identify goethite, with a minor component of iron oxide (hematite). There are also traces of earthen min erals, mainly quartz, plagioclase and calcium carbonate, and finally a siallitic component near the detection limit. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are very grateful to E. Loliva for the photographs of the seal and of the stone tokens found on surface at Ilgynly-depe, and to M. Morello for the drawings of Figure 2.
