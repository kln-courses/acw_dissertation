LEVEY2 Department of Zoology, P.O. 118525, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611-8525 SYNOPSIS. Understanding the evolutionary ecology of ethanol production may yield insights into why hu- mans are prone to excessive consumption of ethanol. In particular, Dudley (2000) suggested that human ancestors developed a genetically based attraction to ethanol because they could use its odor plume to locate fruiting trees and because of health benefits from its consumption. If so, ethanol should be common in wild fruits and frugivores should prefer fruits with higher ethanol content. A literature review reveals that ethanol is indeed common in wild fruits but that it typically occurs in very low concentrations. Furthermore, fru- givores strongly prefer ripe over rotting fruits, even though the latter may contain more ethanol. (Data on ethanol content of ripe and rotting wild fruit are lacking.) These results cast doubt on Dudley's hypothesis and raise the question of how humans became exposed to sufficiently high concentrations of ethanol to allow its excessive consumption. Because fermentation is an ancient and widespread practice, I suggest that hu- mans "discovered" ethanol while using fermentation as a food preservation technique. They may have been predisposed to consume ethanol from previous and beneficial exposure to much lower doses or they may have become addieted to it at high concentrations because of fortuitous physiological responses. INTRODUCTION Excessive consumption of alcohol is a major threat to human health in many societies. Research on alco- holism generally focuses on physiological and psycho- logical bases of addiction. This mechanistic approach, which characterizes biomedical research in general, is based on common sense: understanding how the body responds to ethanol consumption allows development of treatments that target key vulnerabilities or that take advantage of existing detoxification mechanisms. Yet despite its success and future potential, this approach is handcuffed. The handcuffs result from a general failure to in- corporate evolutionary theory. Alcoholism did not arise de novo and humans are not unique in their ex- posure to ethanol, the most common type of naturally produced and consumed alcohol. Indeed, an evolution- ary basis for susceptibility to alcoholism is suggested by its heritability and by biogeographic pattems of al- cohol dehydrogenase (ADH) occurrence (Goldman, 1993; Shen et al., 1997). As argued by proponents of Darwinian medicine, consideration of both proximate (mechanistic) and ultimate (evolutionary) factors holds great promise for providing new insights about the or- igins and treatments of human diseases, including al- coholism (Nesse and Williams, 1994; Stearns, 1999). This review addresses a recent evolutionary hypoth- esis for the evolution of alcoholism. Dudley (2000, 2002) posits that the highly frugivorous diet of hom- inids and their closest relatives chronically exposed them to ethanol within fruits. These primates may have keyed into ethanol because its odor plume can be used to find fruiting trees, and because its ingestion pro- vides calories and can stimulate appetite and yield health benefits via hormetic processes. Just as an evo- lutionarily-based attraction to highly caloric foods by our ancestors may have predisposed humans to obesity and Type II diabetes in modern societies with an abun- dance of fat and sugar rich food (Eaton and Eaton, 1999), the susceptibility to alcoholism may be viewed as the result of nutritional excess. A variation of this hypothesis was proposed by (Singh, 1985). I address three issues related to Dudley's hypothesis. First, I describe the evolutionary ecology of ethanol production in wild fruits. In particular: What accounts for the occurrence of ethanol? How common is it? And, what are typical ethanol concentrations encoun- tered by frugivorous vertebrates? Second, I review the scanty literature on whether vertebrate frugivores pre- fer fruits with presumably higher levels of ethanol over conspecific fruits with presumably lower levels of eth- anol. The goal is to evaluate a central prediction of Dudley's hypothesis: ethanol-rich fruits should be pre- ferred over those with little or no ethanol. My third objective is to propose a modification of the hypoth- esis. Specifically, I will argue that frequent consump- tion of ethanol-rich fruits is not a prerequisite for ex- cessive ethanol consumption by humans. ETHANOL PRODUCTION Natural history of fruit rot By far the most common natural source of ethanol is fermentation of fruit sugars by yeasts. Indeed, yeast is typically envisioned as an anaerobic organism and credited for the following reaction, upon which the beer and wine industries are based: C6H1206 -&gt; 2C2H5OH + 2C02 Ecologically, however, yeasts are far more diverse; only a small subset of species specialize on fruits and of those that do, most can ferment carbon-rich sub- strates other than glucose (e.g., polysaccharides and I From the symposium In Vino Veritas: The Comparative Biology of Alcohol Consumption presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, 5-9 January 2004, at New Orleans, Louisiana. 2 E-mail: dlevey@zoo.ufl.edu 284</page><page sequence="2">EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY OF ETHANOL PRODUCTION 285 lipids; Phaff et al., 1966). None is reliant on anaerobic metabolism alone and many can shift between fermen- tative and respiratory (aerobic) pathways, depending on conditions (Cooke, 1979). In aerobic environments, ethanol is oxidized by yeasts or Acetobacter bacteria, often resulting in production of acetic acid (vinegar). Both ethanol and acetic acid can inhibit further growth of yeasts (Skinner et al., 1980). The important point is that ethanol production is self-limiting and occurs only in anaerobic environments. Functionally, this sug- gests that small fruits, which have relatively high sur- face-to-volume ratios, will be less likely to harbor large colonies of ethanol-producing yeasts than large fruits, which have a relatively high proportion of pulp shielded from aerobic conditions. Small fruits are ad- ditionally unlikely to be an important ethanol source because any ethanol they may contain is more prone to evaporative loss than is the case in larger fruits, which have relatively smaller surface areas. In a sim- ilar vein, ethanol content is likely to differ between lipid-rich fruits and sugar-rich fruits, being higher in the latter because simple sugars are more readily fer- mented than lipids. Unfortunately, predictors of etha- nol content in ripe wild fruits remain unexplored. How common are fruit rot fungi? Tang et al. (2003) report a total of 102 taxa on eighteen species of wild fruits in Hong Kong. In less thorough screenings of fungi from surface-sterilized ericaceous and solana- ceous fruits, 14 and 10 taxa, respectively, were isolated from two North American sites (Cipollini and Stiles, 1993; Cipollini and Levey, 1997). Often more than one species or genus of yeast is present on a given fruit and different species may replace each other over time-i.e., there is a succession of species as the fruit ripens or rots (Phaff et al., 1966; Cooke, 1979; Spen- cer and Spencer, 1997). Different species can also typ- ify different types of fruits. For example, Candida is most common on lipid-rich fruits and Saccharomyces on sugar-rich fruits (Skinner et al., 1980). In the con- text of this review, it is noteworthy that Saccharomy- ces species are abundant, widespread, and champion producers of ethanol; not coincidentally, brewer's yeast (S. cerevisiae) belongs to this genus. Not all fungi associated with fruit cause rot. Some species are latent or endophytic, infecting flowers or immature fruits and persisting for long periods in an asymptomatic state (Snowdon, 1990; Johnson et al., 1992). Cipollini and Stiles (1993) hypothesize a mu- tualistic interaction between endophytic fungi and fruiting plants, whereby the fungi benefit from nutri- ents within pulp and the plants benefit from the fungi inhibiting growth of other species that would quickly cause fruit rot or be otherwise pathogenic. Because many species of Saccharomyces are endophytic, their presence in fruits (and the production of ethanol that accompanies it) should not be assumed to be detri- mental to the fruiting plant. Although it is tempting to assume that ethanol is common because yeast spores and fruits are omni- present, it is important to keep in mind that not all yeasts produce ethanol and those that do produce it only under restrictive (anaerobic) conditions. Further- more, fruits in the temperate zone are typically re- moved by frugivorous vertebrates before they become damaged or show signs of rot (Jordano, 2000; Mc- Carty et al., 2002). Of fruits that are not removed, many are impervious to rot because they are protected by secondary compounds, desiccate, or occur when ambient temperatures are too low for microbial growth (Cipollini and Levey, 1997; Jordano, 2000; McCarty et al., 2002). In the tropics, where fruit diversity is higher, fruit abundance typically less seasonal, and abi- otic conditions generally more favorable for microbial growth, ethanol production in fruits may be more com- mon than at higher latitudes. It takes three to tango: evolutionary ecology offruits and their consumers A fundamental difference between plants and ani- mals is that animals are mobile and plants are not. Fruits are an evolutionary response to this lack of mo- bility in plants; they provide a mechanism by which plants disperse seeds to new sites. Frugivorous verte- brates ingest fruits and the seeds within, later defecat- ing the seeds. Frugivores gain nutrients from the fruit pulp, while plants gain various benefits of seed dis- persal. Fitness advantages to both participants have been so strong and ubiquitous that mechanisms of seed dispersal by vertebrates have evolved in almost all ma- jor lineages of extant seed plants and, conversely, re- liance on fruit is evident in all major lineages of ver- tebrates (Herrera, 2002; Labandeira, 2002). Because the interaction between fruiting plants and frugivorous vertebrates described above is so visibly apparent, it has dominated the research agenda of those interested in the chemical composition of fruits. Un- fortunately, it is a narrow and restrictive view of fruit- frugivore interactions. A central theme of this review is that fruit-frugivore interactions should be viewed as a triad between fruiting plants, vertebrate frugivores, and invertebrate/microbial frugivores (Janzen, 1977; Herrera, 1982; Cipollini and Levey, 1997) (Fig. 1). Ironically, the most abundant frugivores, fungi, are those that are most rarely considered in studies of fru- givory. This oversight is especially pertinent, given that fungi are the primary source of ethanol. We have already considered the interaction between fruiting plants and vertebrate frugivores. To place this in the context of ethanol production requires consid- eration of frugivory from a microbial perspective. I now summarize the remaining two sides of the triad: interactions between microbes and fruiting plants and between microbes and vertebrate frugivores. Unlike the mutualistic interaction between fruiting plants and vertebrate frugivores, the interaction be- tween plants and frugivorous microbes is predatory. Not only do microbial frugivores consume fruits and fail to disperse seeds, but they often render fruits un- attractive to vertebrate frugivores that do disperse seeds. Thus, fruiting plants face an evolutionary dilem-</page><page sequence="3">286 DOUGLAS J. LEVEY An Evolutionary Triad Microbes (Fungi) + (Advantages of seed dispersal) Frugivorous Fruits &gt; Vertebrates + (Nutritional rewards) FIG. 1. Production of ethanol by microbes in fruit is best viewed as a component of a three-way interaction between fruiting plants, microbes (yeast and other fungi), and frugivorous vertebrates. Arrows indicate effects of the organism at the arrow's base on the organism at the arrow's tip, and " +" or "-" signs denote positive or negative effects, respectively. Explanations are in parentheses. The interaction between microbes and vertebrate frugivores is poorly known. ma: how to make their fruits simultaneously attractive to vertebrate frugivores and unattractive to microbial frugivores. A hypothesized means of solving this di- lemma is "directed deterrence," whereby plants pro- duce compounds in fruits that negatively affect micro- bial growth and have little effect on vertebrates (Jan- zen, 1977; Herrera, 1982; Cipollini and Levey, 1997). Directed deterrence provides an adaptive explanation for why all wild fruits contain a rich array of second- ary compounds-why they are so much more than packages of calories and proteins for vertebrate dis- persers. Ethanol, however, should not be viewed in this framework because it is not produced by the fruiting plant. The interaction between vertebrate and microbial frugivores (hereafter, fungi) is largely unexplored and more complex than generally appreciated. The two types of frugivores are best viewed as competitors of an ephemeral resource. Vertebrate frugivores consume many fruits and are capable of extracting nutrients from a given fruit in a matter of minutes, whereas fungal frugivores are each restricted to a single fruit and require days or weeks to profit via sporulation. This asymmetry suggests that fruits are a dangerous habitat for fungi; they may be consumed at any mo- ment by a frugivorous vertebrate (Janzen, 1977; Her- rera, 1989). Because the stakes are high for fruit fungi (reproduction vs. death), fungi should defend them- selves and "their" fruit as soon as possible after col- onizing the fruit (Janzen, 1977). The result is fruit rot. Its efficacy as a defensive mechanism for fruit rot fun- gi is as apparent as rotten fruit is repulsive. Three lessons relevant to ethanol production emerge from consideration of the evolutionary triad (Fig. 1). First, if yeast or other frugivorous fungi "win the bat- tle" for fruit pulp, both fruiting plants and frugivorous vertebrates "lose." All else equal, dual selection pres- sure by plants and vertebrates against frugivorous fun- gi and for each other, means that ethanol production and other processes associated with fruit rot should be rare. Second, frugivorous vertebrates are consistently exposed to secondary metabolites from both fruiting plants and frugivorous fungi. Vertebrate frugivores should thus be physiologically adept at detoxifying such compounds, including ethanol. Third, although ethanol is an end product of fermentation, the fungi that produce it are locked in a complex set of inter- actions with fruiting plants, frugivorous vertebrates, and other microbes. Given that ethanol affects both vertebrates and microbes (Janzen, 1977), it is likely to have at least some adaptive basis. In particular, it may be viewed as a defensive agent, used by yeasts to in- hibit growth of competing microbes in much the same</page><page sequence="4">EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY OF ETHANOL PRODUCTION 287 way as penicillin is thought to give Penicillium fungi the upper hand in competition with bacteria. Ethanol concentrations in wild fruits I am aware of only four studies of ethanol content in wild fruits: Eriksson and Nummi (1982), Dudley (2002), Dominy (2004), and Sanchez et al. (2004). These studies provide data from across a fairly wide range of fruit types: 18 species in 11 families. Ethanol concentrations range from 0.04 to 0.72%. One way to view these data is that ethanol is ubiquitous in ripe fruit; frugivorous vertebrates cannot avoid ethanol in- gestion. Another way to view the same data is that ethanol concentrations are extremely low by anthropomorphic standards, 1-2 orders of magnitude below typical con- centrations in beer and wine (3-6% and 8-1 1%, re- spectively). Such comparisons are potentially mislead- ing, though. An animal's physiological exposure to ethanol is not only a function of the ethanol concen- tration of its food, but also of how much it consumes and the dynamics of ethanol absorption and metabo- lism. Frugivorous birds and bats have particularly high rates of fruit consumption, tied to similarly high fluxes of digesta through the gut (Witmer and Van Soest, 1998; Levey and Martinez del Rio, 2001). They pre- sumably absorb more ethanol than do less frugivorous species of the same body size because their net ab- sorption rates are higher. Balancing this, at least in frugivorous birds, are unusually high activities of al- cohol dehydrogenase (Eriksson and Nummi, 1982; Prinzinger and Hakimi, 1996). Species that are more highly frugivorous tend to have higher rates of alcohol metabolism than do less frugivorous species (Eriksson and Nummi, 1982; Prinzinger and Hakimi, 1996). ETHANOL CONSUMPTION We have seen that ethanol is common in ripe fruits and that it is rapidly consumed and metabolized by frugivorous vertebrates. Frequent ingestion of low eth- anol concentrations likely typifies wild frugivores. At the opposite extreme are rare but consistent accounts of birds and mammals consuming fermented fruits and becoming "drunk" (Siegel and Brodie, 1984; Fitzger- ald et al., 1990). Although such accounts still stir de- bate about whether the animals' uncoordinated behav- ior is due to ethanol or to other compound(s) (Prinzin- ger and Hakimi, 1996), it is safe to conclude that fru- givores occasionally consume highly fermented fruits. In the temperate zone, this tends to happen in the win- ter or early spring, when few other resources are avail- able and fruit cells have ruptured due to freeze-thaw cycles, making them susceptible to fungal attack. Of more interest are situations in which frugivores have the opportunity to select among conspecific fruits with varying amounts of ethanol. This situation is undoubt- edly common; probably every fruiting tree presents unripe, ripe, over-ripe, and rotting fruits, which almost certainly differ in ethanol content. In such cases, a key prediction from Dudley's (2000, 2002) hypothesis is that frugivores should prefer fruits with higher ethanol content. Before summarizing the most relevant studies on vertebrate fruit preferences, a disclaimer is necessary. Because no study on fruit selection has considered- let alone measured-ethanol concentration in fruits, one is confronted with the awkward choice of dis- missing the entire literature on fruit selection or mak- ing a key assumption about how ethanol levels change as fruits ripen. For the purposes of this review, I will assume that ethanol concentrations inerease as fruits progress from ripe to over-ripe to rotten. (These stages of maturation are not discrete. Ripe fruits are typically intact, symmetrical, and evenly colored, whereas rotten fruits are characterized by broken skin, asymmetrical shape, and non-uniform coloration. Over-ripe fruits are intermediate.) Although this assumption seems intui- tive-the more time yeast have to colonize and grow in a given fruit, the more ethanol will be produced- it may well be false because it does not consider ca- tabolism of ethanol by bacteria or vaporization of eth- anol. The only data that address the assumption are scant: in two species of fruits from Panama, Dudley (2002) found ethanol concentrations were higher in "very ripe" than "ripe" fruits. When given a choice of conspecific fruits that vary in maturation and presumably ethanol content, what do frugivorous vertebrates prefer? Using artificial in- fructescences of solanaceous fruits placed in a Costa Rican cloud forest, Valburg (1992) found a strong preference for non-rotting over rotting fruits by both birds and bats. Likewise, Levey (1987 and unpub- lished data) monitored removal of Hamelia patens (Rubiaceae) fruits over an annual cycle and found an extremely strong preference for non-rotted fruits: 76% of unrotted ripe fruits were removed by vertebrates, compared to 0% of rotten fruits. The studies by Valburg and Levey are unique in that they recorded preferences of wild frugivores for ripe and rotting fruits. Other studies on fruit choice by wild birds and mammals are less informative with respect to ethanol because they focus on preferences between intact fruits and insect-infested fruits that are not rot- ting in a way suggestive of ethanol production (e.g., Jordano, 1987). Nonetheless, these studies overwhelm- ingly conclude that frugivores prefer ripe, non-rotting fruits over damaged or rotting fruits. Trials with captive frugivores generally mirror re- sults from field studies: frugivores typically reject rot- ting fruit, regardless the degree of rot (Buchholz and Levey, 1990; Valberg, 1992; Cipollini and Stiles, 1993). In a particularly rigorous set of experiments, Cipollini and Stiles (1993) surface sterilized four spe- cies of ericaceous fruits and inoculated them individ- ually with one of ten species of fruit-rot fungi. Rotted fruits were paired with conspecific non-rotted fruits and presented to frugivorous birds. Overall, non-rotted fruits were consumed at rates 2-3 times higher than rotted fruits, regardless of fruit species. Fungal species, however, had a major impaet on the strength of pref-</page><page sequence="5">288 DOUGLAS J. LEVEY erence for non-rotted fruits. Some species were "tox- ic," severely reducing avian consumption of fruits they infected (e.g., Alternaria alternata), whereas oth- ers had relatively little impact on avian fruit preference (e.g., Botrytis cinerea). Of particular interest, Saccha- romyces cerevisia (a major producer of ethanol), clear- ly belonged to the "non-toxic" group, suggesting that fruits most likely to contain ethanol are also the rotting fruits most likely to be consumed by birds. To summarize, rotten fruits are typically discrimi- nated against by frugivores, suggesting that wild fru- givores do not prefer ethanol-rich fruits. The only means of adequately addressing frugivore preference for ethanol, however, is to conduct preference trials with experimentally manipulated concentrations of ethanol. Sanchez et al. (2004) provide the first such test. They found that Egyptian fruit bats using olfac- tory cues selected feeders that contained mango juice over feeders containing dilute solutions of ethanol (0.001% to 1%). A caveat about interpreting preference trials is that a statistically significant preference for fruits with low- er ethanol content does not preclude a biologically sig- nificant effect of ethanol consumption. Given that ver- tebrate frugivores typically have very high ingestion rates (Levey and Martinez del Rio, 2001), that all fru- givores tested thus far will consume at least some rot- ten fruits even when provided with non-rotted fruits (references above), and that ethanol is present in ripe but non-rotting fruits, it seems premature to conclude that a typical frugivore's daily rate of ethanol con- sumption is negligible. Nonetheless, the prediction from Dudley's (2000) hypothesis that frugivores should prefer ethanol-rich fruits is not generally sup- ported if one accepts the assumption that ethanol con- tent increases as fruits ripen, become over-ripe, and rot. Future studies should examine preferences for ripe versus over-ripe (not rotting) fruit and should experi- mentally manipulate ethanol concentrations in the range typical of ripe and over-ripe fruit. HUMANS, ETHANOL, AND ALCOHOLISM On first appearance, the literature reviewed above does not provide strong support Dudley's hypothesis. Ethanol is ubiquitous in fruits but occurs in relatively low concentrations. And, in situations where its con- centrations are presumably the highest (rotting fruits), frugivores strongly prefer other fruits; they do not ap- pear naturally attracted to ethanol (see also Dominy, 2004; Sanchez et al., 2004). Assuming that human an- cestors were similar to extant frugivores in their con- sumption of ethanol, a missing part of the hypothesis becomes apparent: What is a plausible intermediate stage in the evolution of alcoholism? How does one progress from low-level consumption of ethanol in wild fruits to full-fledged alcoholism? Anthropologists have long recognized the impor- tance of fermented foods in human nutrition. Practi- cally every culture has developed unique and often elaborate processes of fermentation (Battcock and Azam-Ali, 1998). For example, in the Andean region of South America chicha is traditionally made from pulverized corn (Steinkraus, 1995). Corn meal is pre- pared by groups of older women, who thoroughly chew it to produce an intermediate product, "muko." Amylase in their saliva converts starch to sugar in muko, greatly increasing yeast activity and ethanol production in the fermentation process that follows. In an anthropological context, fermentation can be viewed as controlled spoilage of food. Anaerobic con- ditions prevent the succession of microbes that would otherwise completely oxidize the foodstuff. The mi- crobes responsible for the later stages of food spoilage generally cannot grow in alcoholic or acidic environ- ments. Thus, by culturing the production of alcohols and in many cases organic acids via limited exposure to oxygen, the food is protected. Long before refrig- eration and synthetic additives, fermentation was one of the most important food preservation technologies (Battcock and Azam-Ali, 1998). Given the ancient and cosmopolitan reliance on fer- mented foods and the cultural inheritance of their use, I suggest that humans may not have developed their current attraction to ethanol via exposure to wild fruits. Rather, they first encountered high concentrations of ethanol through fermentation processes that were ini- tially fostered for the purpose of food preservation. As they discovered the inebriating qualities of some fer- mented foods, they focused attention on those fermen- tative processes, ultimately leading to the beer and wine industries of today. When viewed in this context, the questions that structured much of this review can be seen as largely irrelevant. It does not matter that ethanol concentra- tions in wild fruits are typically very low or that wild frugivores seem to avoid fruits with the highest ethanol content. Neither condition is necessary for exposure of humans to physiologically meaningful amounts of eth- anol. On one hand, Dudley's hypothesis dodges a bul- let-unsupported predictions are not damning. On the other hand, an alternative but less satisfying explana- tion emerges for alcoholism in humans. Addiction to ethanol may be analogous to addiction to caffeine, nic- otine, heroin, or cocaine. All are secondary metabo- lites that humans have learned to concentrate and that provide a desired physiological response. The response is fortuitous, not adaptive. The principal difference be- tween ethanol and most other addictive substances is that ethanol is produced by fungi, not by plants. How- ever, the evolutionary bases are similar-the adaptive function of such compounds is likely rooted in com- petitive interactions with other organisms.
