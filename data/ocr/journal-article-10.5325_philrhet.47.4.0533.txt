      <p>In 1735 Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist, as well as the founder of modern scientific taxonomy, published the first systematic classification of living things: <italic>Systema naturae</italic>. There, for the first time, human beings are classified in the animal kingdom under the order Anthropomorpha (“manlike” animals)—which makes “man” an animal who resembles itself—and the genus <italic>Homo.</italic> Next to this generic name, however, Linnaeus does not record a distinguishing characteristic, as he does for all the other entries, but instead issues an imperative: “Nosce te ipsum” (“Know yourself”). In the tenth edition of <italic>Systema naturae</italic> (1758), the order Anthropomorpha is renamed Primates (“of the first rank”), but it continues to include the genera <italic>Simia</italic> and <italic>Vespertilio</italic> (bats). In place of the imperative “know yourself,” the genus <italic>Homo</italic> is given the species name <italic>sapiens—</italic>knowing, conscious, wise. However, Linnaeus scholar Gunnar Broberg argues that “<italic>sapiens</italic> is, according to the rules of taxonomy, only a specific epithet (trivial name) and not a definition,” nor is it “necessarily descriptive” (1994, 176). <italic>Sapiens</italic> appears in this updated version not as the missing descriptor, Giorgio Agamben concurs, but as a “simplification” of the initial imperative, retaining the generic name's essential emptiness (2004, 25).</p>
      <p>Broberg notes that Linnaeus's decision to corral human beings in with the animals without providing a definitive distinction between <italic>homo</italic> and <italic>bestiae</italic> provoked some static within the scientific and theological communities. Particularly offensive was his insistence that the other animals “cannot be called <italic>irrationalia,</italic>” that animals have a soul and reason to varying degrees. “Theology decrees that man has a soul and that the animals are mere <italic>automata mechanica</italic>,” Linnaeus writes, but “Cartesius certe non vidit simias” (“[René] Descartes certainly had not seen an ape”) (qtd. in Broberg 1994, 166). From the perspective of morality, Linnaeus concedes that there is “a splendidly great difference” between “a man and a <italic>bestia</italic>.” “Man is the animal,” he writes, “which the Creator has seen fit to honor with such a magnificent mind and has condescended to adopt as his favorite and for which he has prepared a nobler life” (qtd. in Broberg 1994, 167). However, from the perspective of natural history, his “workshop,” he insists that human beings are not distinguishable from apes and that the best possible way to articulate a distinction is through the imperative: “Nosce te ipsum” (Broberg 1994, 171). What distinguishes a human being from a <italic>bestia</italic> emerges only in the unique <italic>manner</italic> of existence opened for the being who knows itself. Human beings, precisely in <italic>knowing</italic> who they are, <italic>become</italic> who they are and <italic>demonstrate</italic> their defining characteristic. “Nosce te ipsum” means, for him, something like: become yourself—or remain the ape that you also (zoologically) are.</p>
      <p>So while Linnaeus does claim to embrace human exceptionalism, for him it's not the result of some distinguishing material characteristic but, as Broberg puts it, of “something specifically immaterial” or “invisible in man” from which “our self-knowledge arises” (1994, 163, 170). It's complicated, though, because the “soul and reason” duo, which Broberg says Linnaeus insists “occur[s] throughout the animal kingdom” (166), already implies some level of self-referential consciousness. If “soul and reason” are not specifically human capacities, then their condition of possibility can't be, either. Linnaeus claims that human beings distinguish themselves by knowing themselves and/but simultaneously implies that many or perhaps all animals, according to some differential measure, know themselves. Descartes and Linnaeus both propose that the irruption of the specifically human being takes place in a scene of self-recognition. However, whereas Descartes insists that self-knowledge inscribes an uncrossable abyss between “human” and “animal,” Linnaeus fabulously equivocates.</p>

         <title>BE-DOUBLED: CONJURING THE I</title>
         <p>Unlike taxonomists, philosophers and rhetoricians have been much more inclined to follow Descartes than Linnaeus on this point, embracing and endlessly retracing what they consider—despite everything—to be the single, irrefutable distinction between “the human” and “the animal.”<sup>1</sup> Some of the most (otherwise) nonfoundational thinkers devote themselves to this Cartesian dichotomy, including, as Jacques Derrida demonstrates, Immanuel Kant, Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Lacan. Rhetorical studies has been less committed to spotlighting or inspecting this indivisible line than to presuming it. Rhetorical acts are held to be distinctly human acts inasmuch as they're grounded not so much in the power to speak (certain birds can do that) but in a more originary capability for self-reflexivity. In both philosophy and rhetoric, at least since Descartes, autodeixis, the self-reflexive power of the I—which already means “I am” or “I think”—has been considered the condition for language acquisition, as reason and thought more generally depend on “the ipseity of being <italic>able to be</italic> or <italic>able to do</italic> ‘I,’” as Derrida puts it, “even before any autoreferential utterance in language” (2008, 92). A parrot, a myna, a parakeet may imitate human speech—may even say “I”—but without this self-reflexive capacity it could not have a clue what it's saying. These birds don't <italic>have</italic> language, it is argued, but possess instead an instinctive (and sometimes freakishly convincing) ability to imitate the being who has language.</p>
         <p>Without access to an autoreferential I and so without a representable sense of self, the argument goes, animals are completely determined by and identical to their genetic coding: they are, in the words of George Bataille, “in the world like water in water” (1989, 24).<sup>2</sup> That is to say, “the animal” reacts according to the repetitive mechanicity of its programming, but because it cannot access a necessary self-distance—because it cannot step back from itself into a kind of reflective clearing in order to recognize itself—it cannot know or refer to itself <italic>as</italic> itself. It can never get its head above “the water,” so to speak, and therefore can never authentically respond to a question or a situation. It is precisely “the essence of animality,” as Heidegger will say, to be incapable of response.<sup>3</sup> Animals, like painting and writing in Plato's <italic>Phaedrus</italic>, “stand there as if alive, but if you ask them something, they preserve a quite solemn silence” (2005, 63). And that, according even to Continental thinkers from at least Descartes to at least Lacan, is the essential abyss that separates those who call themselves human from those they call “the animal.” Contemporary rhetorical studies has tended to simply concur without comment.<sup>4</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The putatively solid border between human and animal grounds the history of philosophy, Judeo-Christian religions, Western culture itself; politics, law, and ethics are erected on it, and the very idea of human rights requires it. Yet we now know that certain animals pass the same mirror test used to determine self-recognition in human children; many more use tools, share distinct languages and complex social interactions, have a sense of past and future, pass knowledge from one generation to the next, and indicate varying propensities for laughter, grief, deception, empathy, and shame.<sup>5</sup> It would be difficult to overestimate what's at stake in these discoveries, which contest the opposition by which the figure of the responding and responsible human subject is secured: a <italic>bestia</italic> presumed to be incapable of response. The question now is not whether animals have powers humans have denied them so much as whether <italic>humans</italic> have the power to be or to do <italic>I</italic> in the way that philosophy and rhetorical studies have presumed. For our purposes here, what this research exposes is the practically unfathomable scope and significance of rhetorical operations, which were never simply human. An underivable rhetoricity is the immaterial “something” from which a presumption of “self-knowledge arises,” I'll argue: it's not an innate quality “in man” but the already relational condition for <italic>any</italic> living being who presumes to recognize and refer to him- or herself. The I is generated, each time, in the gap between me and myself, between the one recognizing and the one recognized, where an extrahuman rhetorical relation plays itself out. My aim is to call rhetorical studies “home”—to its unhomey, preontological, ahuman home—by exposing an irreducible rhetoricity as the condition for the presumption of any <italic>I</italic>.</p>

         <title>“I AM” (NOT) AN ANIMAL</title>
         <p>If philosophy takes up the endless task of locating and confirming the existence of an abyss that separates “the human” from “the animal,” that's in part because that abyss is presumed (by almost everyone) to run first of all <italic>through</italic> man and woman, the human-animal, evading efforts to pinpoint its exact location.<sup>6</sup> At the intersection of the I and “the animal” there is, as they say, a great and unleapable chasm that is nonetheless impossible to map with any precision. According to Descartes, the specifically human part of the human animal—the thinking part—is not in <italic>any</italic> sense animal. He concludes in <italic>The Discourse on Method</italic> that “I am” already means “I think” and vice versa; it presumes a private mental life, the self's immediate and knowing relation to itself. The specifically human dimension of the human animal, in other words, is defined not through simple autoaffection or automotricity, the self-relation that would sustain every living thing, but through self-<italic>knowledge</italic>, self-<italic>recognition</italic>, self-<italic>understanding</italic>. Derrida:<disp-quote>
               <p>No one denies the animal auto-affection or auto-motion, hence the self of that relation to the self. But what is in dispute—and it is here that the functioning and the structure of the “I” count so much, even where the word <italic>I</italic> is lacking—is the power to make reference to the self in deictic or autodeictic terms, the capability at least virtually to turn a finger toward oneself in order to say “this is I.” (2008, 94)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>What is supposed to distinguish the human from the merely living being is the capacity for autoreferential self-distancing, which grants self-presence, the absolute proximity of the being to itself.</p>
         <p>The animal side is “generally defined as sensibility, irritability, and <italic>auto-motricity</italic>, a spontaneity that is capable of movement, of organizing itself and affecting itself, marking, tracing, and affecting itself with traces of itself” (Derrida 2008, 49). These are defining characteristics of the life of the living in general, but because “the animal” does not have the power to distance itself from itself and so to grasp and refer to itself, the argument goes, it “will lack any ‘I think,’ as well as understanding and reason, response and responsibility” (94). “The animal” lives and therefore writes itself, leaving its zoographical traces, but it has no autodeictic capacity and so no I; it therefore does not and cannot <italic>refer</italic> to its “own” traces, it cannot give an account of itself (cannot write its <italic>auto</italic>zoography), and so it cannot respond or take responsibility for itself. That's the standard argument.</p>
         <p>According to Descartes, <italic>I</italic> exist(s) only when <italic>I</italic> think(s). All the rest—the “life of the living”—is the “self” leaving the traces, the animal to which the human being alone is supposed to have the power to refer. This merely living being has nothing else to do with the human being that “I am.” Indeed, he insists that when “I am,” the animal has been utterly transcended. It's thanks to the reflexive power of the <italic>autos</italic> that “I am,” that I raise my head above the proverbial water and become capable of genuine response and (so) of responsibility—of politics, of ethics, of justice, of the rhetorical arts. And Derrida notes that despite “immense differences” separating Kant, Heidegger, Levinas, and Lacan, each of their discourses on the subject (conscious or unconscious), “even if it locates difference, inadequation, the dehiscence within autoaffection, and so forth,” remains Cartesian in that it “continues to link subjectivity with man” (1991, 105). Each of these thinkers share with Descartes certain presuppositions about what they all call “the animal,” presuppositions that “come down to the same thing, to this sameness, to the very same fact that I am [<italic>à cela même que je suis</italic>]” (2008, 89–90).<sup>7</sup>
         </p>
         <p>And it's not as if these presuppositions end with Lacan. Alain Badiou, for example, boldly claims that <italic>I</italic> is an <italic>infinite</italic> and <italic>immortal</italic> capacity inherent in “pure” or “generic” humanity. It is thanks to this I that human beings are not reducible to “suffering beast[s]” (2001, 11), that they exist not as finite beings but as “beings-for-the-infinite” (2003, 137). His audacious language is offered in explicit opposition to Heidegger, who proposes that Dasein's existence is finite, so it may be helpful to review Heidegger quickly on this point. For him, finitude is what <italic>distinguishes</italic> human Dasein from “the animal,” which is not a finite being. The animal lives but it doesn't ek-sist and so has no sense of itself <italic>as</italic> itself, of its life or its eventual death; captivated in-itself to the end, it will eventually perish but will never properly die, Heidegger argues. Finitude and mortality are modes of ek-sistence. To exist is to live <italic>outside</italic> oneself, in-the-world, exposed—there is therefore no essence or in-itselfness of finitude: it's always shared (out). There is in finitude an intrinsic infinity, then; the mortal being is infinitely finite. Finitude and mortality don't describe a discrete boundary or some biological overdetermination but instead designate a manner of being that's proper only to those beings capable of autoreferential self-distancing. Human Dasein is the only finite, mortal being, Heidegger insists, and so the only being capable of the sort of finite transcendence (transcendence <italic>in</italic> finitude, not beyond it) that he calls “being-toward-death” (“Sein-zum-Tode”), a mode of being in which Dasein embraces its life while facing its death, and so—in a certain sense, he thinks—prevails over it.</p>
         <p>Badiou, ignoring or missing the nuance of Heidegger's position—it's unclear which—assumes instead that finitude names a physical vulnerability to suffering and death.<sup>8</sup> To say that human being is finite, he writes, is to equate “man with his animal substructure”; it is to reduce “him to the level of a living organism pure and simple” (2001, 11), which is for Badiou an outrage: “This ‘living being’ is in reality contemptible,” he exclaims, “and <italic>he will indeed be held in contempt</italic>” (12).<sup>9</sup> While “humanity is an animal species,” Badiou acknowledges, “mortal and predatory,” those are not the traits that distinguish “humanity within the world of the living” (2). The human being distinguishes itself from “the animal” not through his or her “fragile body” but, even in the most tragic and degrading situations, through a “stubborn determination to remain what he [or she] is—that is to say, precisely something other than a victim, other than a being-for-death, and thus: something other than a mortal being” (11). In Badiou's hands Heidegger's <italic>Sein-zum-Tode</italic> becomes the vulnerability of the contemptible “living being,” but the specifically human side of the human animal, Badiou argues, is a capacity to be <italic>immortal</italic>.</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>Man's identity is immortal at the instant in which he affirms himself as someone who runs counter to the temptation of wanting-to-be-an-animal to which circumstances may expose him. And we know that every human being is <italic>capable</italic> of being immortal— unpredictably, be it in circumstances great or small, for truths important or secondary. In each case, subjectification is immortal and makes Man [or Woman]. Beyond this, there is only a biological species, a “biped without feathers,” whose charms are not obvious. (12)</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>There is for him nothing charming—and nothing human—about the “biological species” we call <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, “the haggard animal” exposed to suffering and death (13). Salvation lies in the fact that “Man <italic>thinks</italic>,” Badiou insists; “Man is a tissue of truths” and so more than his or her “contemptible” zoological life (12).<sup>10</sup>
         </p>
         <p>For Badiou, what separates “human” from “animal” is a generically human capacity to remain faithful to a truth process: to be subjectivized by the truth of an event, to become the subject of that immortal truth, and so to partake of its infinity—which sounds just an awful lot like the finite mode of existence that Heidegger calls “being-toward-death.” Whereas Heidegger demonstrates within finitude an inherent infinity, Badiou champions the infinite <italic>as opposed</italic> to the finite, immortality <italic>as opposed</italic> to mortality. Still, they both draw an indivisible line between “the human” and “the animal,” and they both draw it at the autodeictic (gathering) capacity of the I.</p>

         <title>AUTO-BIO-GRAPHY: “I AM … I SAID”</title>
         <p>Autodeixis is a kind of conjuring power, a seemingly magical (performative) capacity thought to summon a human being from the zoological body of an ape. It names an exceptional sort of autoaffection in which a being refers to itself not <italic>as such</italic> but <italic>as if</italic> in the “living present” of its own self-presence: “I.” When I say “I,” I'm claiming “to point myself out physically, in the present, to introduce myself in the present and in my ‘totally naked truth,’” Derrida writes (2008, 50). However, the gesture involves a temporal split: the one pointing (the I of the “I think”) and the one pointed to (the life of the living) are not simply identical—they are, Alexander Garcia Düttmann writes, “not-one” (2000, 5). Or, as Derrida puts it, “What can look at itself is not one” (1997, 36). But the relation to the self is not simply specular—alterity is primary.<sup>11</sup> There is a “difference within auto-affection,” Derrida notes in his reading of Husserl, that involves the identification of “identity and nonidentity within the ‘sameness’ of the <italic>im selben Augenblick</italic> [at that same moment]” (1973, 68). Hearing or seeing or otherwise experiencing myself <italic>as</italic> myself already involves the mediation/contamination of some outside, so that <italic>within</italic> the putative immediacy of autoaffection, in the between of me and myself, “a pure difference comes to divide self-presence” (1973, 82). Pure autoaffection turns out to be an irreducible hetero-affection in which the “sameness” has already welcomed within itself the trace of an “otherness,” and the <italic>me</italic> to which <italic>I</italic> intend(s) to point has already made tracks. This is not news.</p>
         <p>But it does indicate, Derrida suggests in <italic>The Animal That Therefore I Am</italic>, that “the question of the ‘I,’ of the ‘I am’ or ‘I think,’ would have to be displaced toward the prerequisite question of the other: the other, the other me that I am (following) or that is following me” (2008, 95). <italic>I</italic> can only ever point or refer to an other who is already gone, an other who is ahead of me or behind me or even in me. The curious accomplishment of the I involves something like “the human” pointing to the effaced traces of an animal presumed to be incapable of pointing. The I, which can only be self-reflexive, autobiographical, nonetheless cannot point to its self, no more than “the animal” can—the animal that <italic>therefore</italic> “I am” (following). In French, Derrida notes, “Je suis” means both “I am” and “I follow.” With all due respect to Descartes on the one hand, and to the Elephant Man on the extreme other, <italic>I</italic> am/is indeed an animal—or else its only task is to follow one, to decipher its traces, to give it face and voice, to write its auto-bio-graphy. “What this animal is, what it will have been, what it would, would like to, or could be,” Derrida writes, “is perhaps what <italic>I am</italic> following” (2008, 33).</p>
         <p>Autobiography distinguishes itself from fiction inasmuch as it is supposed to depend on a referent that predates it, in the same way, de Man writes, that “a photograph depends on its subject or a (realistic) picture on its model” (1984, 69). The referent of any autobiography is the living self, the self as a living being, and what de Man calls “the autobiographical moment” takes place wherever an “I” pops up and presumes to be the subject of that living being's understanding (70)—wherever, that is, the allegory of autodeicticity plays itself out. The “I” is a sign of life that “speaks of itself … as living, living in the present, in the living present,” at least in the moment “I” is uttered, and that remains the case, Derrida observes, “even were it to be already a dead thing speaking” (2008, 56).<sup>12</sup> The built-in guarantee of the “auto-bio-graphical” derives from the fact that that “I”—though infinitely reproducible, imitable, citable—presents itself <italic>as</italic> (<italic>if</italic>) a <italic>sign of life</italic>. To pose oneself as an I is already to sign for or sign off on the living self. Autobiography is the inscription of self-reference (“I”), and yet <italic>I</italic> is not and cannot be simply present to itself, identical to itself; it's always “speaking of another, … quoting another” (2008, 57). And the self to which “I” refers, as Derrida puts it in his reading of de Man, “only appears to itself in this bereaved allegory, in this hallucinatory prosopopoeia” (1989, 28).</p>
         <p>A spectral figure is conjured in the gesture of recognition, and through the inscriptive force of allegory, it says “t/here I am.”<sup>13</sup> Allegory—from the Greek “allos” (“other”) plus “agoria” (“speaking”)—names a way of “speaking otherwise.” It's not a trope, according to de Man, because it doesn't involve a substitution in meaning, “the transport,” as Avital Ronell puts it, “of a sense from one signifier to another” (2002, 158). To the extent that it involves no substitution, its operations are not figural but “parafigural” and irreducible to the trope (which it instead <italic>installs</italic>) of intentional consciousness. For de Man, allegory “represents one of language's essential possibilities,” Derrida notes: “the possibility that permits language to say the other and to speak of itself while speaking of something else; the possibility of always saying something other than what it gives to be read.” Allegory is therefore “also what precludes any totalizing summary—the exhaustive narrative or total absorption of a memory” (1989, 11).</p>
         <p>Though it is “associated with the drive to translate and a struggle to establish cognition,” Ronell writes, allegory resists comprehensive appropriation and therefore “involves an experience of loss and mourning,” which is why she counts it among the “debilitators of meaning and being” (2002, 158–59). Tom Cohen, quoting Walter Benjamin, explains that “allegory ‘means precisely the <italic>non-existence</italic> of what it (re)presents’” (1998, 105). While it masquerades as representational, as mere translation or close reading of what already is, passing itself off as a cognitive stabilizer or energizer, allegory is better described as a performative installation with awesome positing power. It is not representational but names “the site of a mnemonic transformation in which anteriority itself stands to be recast, <italic>reinscribed</italic>, and alternate ‘futures’ opened as virtual,” Cohen writes (223). Inscribing the anteriority it claims merely to translate, allegory opens potentialities with no material foundation save the materiality of the inscription itself. “To the extent that it calls for an ever-renewed form of what Freud called ‘reality-testing,’” Ronell explains, “allegory interrogates that which is not present but which tirelessly summons us to seek the materiality that remains out of our grasp” (2002, 107). This is why the effect of the allegorical seems, as Georg Friedrich Creuzer puts it—Benjamin quotes him—“startling and momentary,” like the “sudden appearance of a ghost” (qtd. in Benjamin 2003, 163).</p>
         <p>Autobiography, de Man observes, is inherently allegorical, pointing as it does to the materiality of an inscription: a materiality without matter, without presence. The trope of autobiography is prosopopoeia, he explains, and the trope of prosopopoeia is apostrophe. Prosopopoeia names the “fiction of an apostrophe to an absent, deceased or voiceless entity, which posits the possibility of the latter's reply, and confers upon it the power of speech. Voice assumes mouth, eye, and finally face, a chain that is manifest in the etymology of the trope's name, <italic>prosopon poiein</italic>, to confer a mask or a face (<italic>prosopon</italic>)” (1984, 75–76). Like <italic>ethopoeia</italic>, prosopopoeia is traditionally understood as a synonym for personification: a figure through which an absent or imaginary person is represented as speaking or acting in the present. It derives from the Greek, Cynthia Chase notes, citing the <italic>OED</italic>, “<italic>prosopon</italic>—face, person, and <italic>poiein</italic>—make” (1986, 83). But de Man translates “<italic>prosopon</italic> as ‘face’ or ‘mask,’ and not as ‘person,’” to emphasize that “a face is the condition—not the equivalent—of the existence of a person” (83). For him, prosopopoeia is not synonymous with anthropomorphism, says Chase, since prosopopoeia does not take “the human” as given but instead makes it “dependent upon the giving of a figure, that of ‘face’” (1986, 84). In autobiography, prosopopoeia <italic>bestows</italic> the “face,” the speaking consciousness that is supposed to precede it, conjuring the figure of the self-present and self-referencing self. “I” claims itself, its language, and its life, takes charge of itself; it not only writes itself (zoographically) but <italic>refers</italic> to itself (autobiographically). That's its story.</p>
         <p>However, this allegory is forever bereaved inasmuch as it cannot <italic>not</italic> present the nonbeing of what it re-presents: the “absent, deceased, or voiceless entity” that the conferred face enfaces. “Prosopopoeia,” de Man writes, “is hallucinatory. To make the invisible visible is uncanny.” Like poetry, what autobiography gives us is “not a hallucination but a hallucinatory effect” (1997, 49), a haunting, the presence of an absence. Presenting the nonpresence of its supposed antecedent, this “hallucinatory prosopopoeia”—<italic>I</italic> or “I” (performed or uttered)—installs what Ronell describes as “an acute crisis in the management of anteriority” (2002, 106). Despite the persistent gathering up of its “own” traces, <italic>I</italic> never presents its self, never finally offers itself up in its “totally naked truth.” In the allegory called autobiography, the life you lose—that you gain by losing—will be your “own.” The I, an “auto-hetero-affective” phantom, can guarantee nothing, least of all its self. “I don't know” is “the very modality of the experience of the spectral,” Derrida notes, “and moreover of the surviving trace in general” (2011, 137).</p>
         <p>The autobiographical animal conjures itself but never finally gets to itself or becomes itself, which is maybe why “know yourself” had to be inscribed as an eternal imperative. Autobiography is not a genre, says de Man, but a figure of understanding that involves the stitching together of disparate traces, which not even the most profound narrative power can pull to a close. A gesture of aberrant performative positings, autobiography's task is to make present the self to which the “I” refers, but it can never close the deal. No matter how forcefully <italic>I</italic> insist(s) on it or restate(s) it, the allegory remains bereaved, hallucinatory. Any attempt at reappropriation “produces the opposite of what it apparently aims for,” Derrida writes: “ex-appropriation” (1991, 105). Autobiographical inscription points, at best, to the deserted tracks of the living animal that <italic>therefore</italic> “I am” (following).<sup>14</sup>

            <italic>I</italic> is not who or what or where it says it is. Forever alienated from itself, trailing behind or running ahead of itself, <italic>I</italic> can only pick up traces of the animal that “I am” or that “I follow”—or that is following me (because it's never quite clear who is after whom). <italic>I</italic> points to “a wound that can never be healed,” Cary Wolfe observes, a wound “that is only further deepened by the very iterative technologies (‘thinking,’ ‘writing,’ ‘speech’) that we use to try to suture it” (2008, 29). The I, which is said to be the absolutely distinguishing capacity of the human, can only be other than itself, ahuman, in at least two senses. First, it can only refer to traces of the voiceless animal which it says both that it is (“here I am”) and that it isn't (“I am not an animal”), and second, it can only do so, <italic>I</italic> can only say <italic>anything</italic>, as Wolfe notes, through its “subjection to and constitution in the materiality and technicity of a language that is always on the scene before [it is], as a precondition of [its] subjectivity” (28). The power and the capacity assumed by the I covers over a more fundamental vulnerability and exposedness, a “‘not being able’ that makes [its] very conceptual life possible” (28). There can be no saying “I” or doing <italic>I</italic> that is not already a citation, an imitation.</p>
         <p>One might argue that it is precisely this experience of allegorical bereavement, of an infinite finitude, that does distinguish “the human” from “the animal.” If autodeixis is a specifically human phenomenon, then it is the distinguishing predicament of human being alone to live <italic>as</italic> this bereaved allegory, as its hallucinatory protagonist. Whereas “the animal” is supposed to live immediately and in absolute immanence, human being is destined to transcend itself and its environment through a hallucinatory effect that gives it a sense of self only by foreclosing any achievement of it. What makes a human being human, Judith Butler proposes in <italic>Giving An Account of Oneself</italic> (2005), is not some power—not even the power of reason—but this experience of bereavement and its accompanying acknowledgment of fallibility, fragility, and vulnerability. What is distinctly human from this perspective is the experience of self-loss in the inevitably missed encounter, each time, with the animal that one says one both is and isn't and the experience of powerlessness, an impossible impotence, that comes from never being able to acknowledge or express this trauma without repeating it.</p>
         <p>But on the other hand, perhaps autodeixis is not strictly human. Bottlenose dolphins, elephants, orcas, magpies, and all the great apes respond to their reflections <italic>as if</italic> in the living present of their own self-presence: in addition to picking at the mark placed on them by researchers, they may check their teeth, fluff their fur, explore facial expressions or bodily gestures. Looking at themselves, and so already not-one, these animals embrace <italic>as</italic> themselves the hallucinatory protagonist “recognized” in the mirror, presuming to do the I without saying it, without speaking it. And this is not simply an ocular phenomenon. A recent study conducted by biologists, for example, found that bottlenose dolphins “develop individually distinctive … ‘signature whistles.’” A signature whistle is “a learned, individually distinctive whistle type in a dolphin's repertoire that broadcasts the identity of the whistle owner” (King and Janik 2013, 13216). Researchers found that dolphins only respond to their own whistle calls, and they do so by (re)sounding (countersigning) their whistle in response: “here I am.” “Learned signatures” have also been observed in wild parrots, who use specific contact calls to identify themselves and others (Berg et. al 2012). Such studies suggest, among other things, that alphabetic language may not be the only language for which allegory represents an “essential possibility,” that certain phantasmatic (“as if”) operations may not (cannot) be simply human.</p>
         <p>Many animals do appear to be incapable of what Derrida calls “<italic>literal</italic> auto-reference,” and yet it's not certain, he observes, that “this auto-deicticity doesn't take on highly developed, differentiated, and complex forms in a large number of social phenomena that can be observed in the <italic>animot</italic>.” Consider the “phenomena of narcissistic exhibition in seduction or sexual combat, the ‘follow me who is (following) you’ deployed in colors, music, adornments, parades, or erections of all sorts” that can only “derive from such an auto-deixis” (2008, 95). There is some presumption of I-ness involved in displays that call attention to oneself or that pose oneself in a way that says “here I am” or “I was here,” including the deliberate marking of territory. Indeed, each time “a cat recognizes a cat and begins to know, if not in the end say, that ‘a cat is a cat,’” Derrida writes, or when any “living creature identifies another living creature of its own species as its neighbor [<italic>prochain</italic>] or fellow [<italic>semblable</italic>],” or when certain animals identify their partner, friend, enemy, or themselves “by the sound of their voices or their songs” or communicate with one another “through the play of call and response between voices,” and so on, “one has to register some mirror effect—visual, aural, indeed olfactory—some hetero-narcissistic ‘self-as-other’” (59–60).</p>
         <p>It's not even certain, Derrida continues, “that this auto-deicticity is not at work, in various forms, evidently, in every genetic system in general, where each element of the genetic writing has to identify itself, mark itself according to a certain reflexivity, in order to signify in the genetic chain” (95). There would be no life—no genetic codes, no cellular function—Derrida is suggesting, if a being could not mark itself off, trace and retrace itself on the limit that both shares and divides it.<sup>15</sup> A certain autodeicticity is inherent in the perpetual (re)inscription of this differential relation, in this arche-writing that would be the condition for both life and the letter. Heidegger comes close to this insight in <italic>The Fundamental Concepts</italic> when he describes an animal organism as a “particular and fundamental manner of being” that is characterized by “a proper peculiarity” (<italic>Eigentümlichkeit</italic>), by its way of being proper to itself, of possessing or containing itself (1995, 235). This self-referential manner of being, Heidegger notes, is more original than the organism and so prior to any strictly biological description.</p>
         <p>Nonetheless, Heidegger is emphatic (note the hyperbolic use of italics) that a strict distinction maintains itself between the “proper peculiarity” of an animal organism, which is self-referential “<italic>without</italic> any so-called <italic>self-consciousness</italic> or any <italic>reflection</italic> at all, without any relating back to itself,” and the “proper authenticity” (<italic>Eigentlichkeit</italic>) of Dasein, “the <italic>specifically human particularity</italic>, <italic>its</italic> particular way of being proper to itself,” for which he reserves “the expression ‘self’ and selfhood” (233). The human body, he declares, is from the start “something essentially other than an animal organism” (228). Yet this ostensibly indivisible line separating two ways of being proper to oneself divides itself in ways I won't even pretend to comprehend once a magpie—while maybe singing a round of “I Me Mine” or “I Am the Walrus” or “I'm Every Woman”—presumes to know herself. Especially once we admit that when I say “I” it is as much a citation as it is when she says it.</p>
         <p>The point is not that animals share an autodeictic power presumed to be strictly human but that autodeixis is not a power at all. It's not a power the I has, but that which grants the effect of an I. The “autos” (the identity of the same) names a differential effect with no ontological foundation; it's generated through an originary capacity to be repeated (an iterability) that therefore also “prohibits its stability and autonomy,” like “a circle coming round upon itself without joining up,” Robert Smith writes (1996, 99). “Ex-appropriation is not what is proper to man,” Derrida insists. “One can recognize its differential figures as soon as there is a relation to self in its most elementary forms (but for this very reason there is no such thing as elementary)” (1991, 105).</p>

         <title>SURVIVANCE: ORIGINARY DELAY</title>
         <p>So it is not simply that there is something “immaterial … in man” from which “self-knowledge arises,” as Linnaeus implied, but that this immaterial “something,” this preoriginary rhetoricity, is the very condition for the identity and functioning of <italic>any</italic> living being. To be what it is, a being must mark itself (off from the other) repeatedly in a gesture of self-reference; repeating itself to gather itself, it must both leave and trace traces, address and respond. The trace, Derrida writes, “must be thought before the entity” (1997, 47): a kind of zoography before zoology, rhetoricity before ontology. The trace—the entwinement of the other in the same that makes the “same” possible—is already the heart of any sign; it's the most basic unit of communication, and it's not simply human. What philosophy and rhetorical studies purchase by beginning instead with the letter, word, or signifier—with an anthropological understanding of language—is a metaphysical distinction between “human” and “animal,” linguistic existence and merely living, a distinction that does not dissolve but infinitely divides itself at the level of the trace. The opposition between life and death divides itself here, too, since the trace—every zoographical or autozoographical trace left or traced by every living being—is already a “living-dead machine” that survives its “author” (Derrida 2011, 131). Always available for reanimation, the trace is both the condition for self-reference and what delivers me over “with no possible defense” to the other: to whomever or whatever might “do something with me and my remains, make me into a thing, his or her thing” (126–27).</p>
         <p>Each time we “trace a trace, each time a trace, however singular, is left behind,” Derrida writes, “even before we trace it actively or deliberately, a gestural, verbal, written, or other trace, this machinality virtually entrusts the trace to the sur-vival in which the opposition of the living and the dead loses and must lose all pertinence, all its edge.” This “alliance of the dead and the living,” he observes, is both the “origin of all <italic>tekhnē</italic>” and “the chance and the threat of finitude” (130). Finitude, in this sense, he calls “survivance,” and up against it Badiou's principle of immortality shatters, as does Heidegger's insistence that only human Dasein ek-sists. Survivance, in the middle voice, names a sort of survival that is “neither life nor death pure and simple” but the “groundless ground from which are detached, identified, and opposed what we think we can identify” as life <italic>or</italic> death (131). Everything begins with this survivance; it's at the heart of the heart, precluding any simple distinction between language and life: “survival is an originary concept that constitutes the very structure we call existence, <italic>Dasein</italic>, if you will,” Derrida notes. “We are structurally survivors, marked by this structure of the trace and of the testament” (2007, 50).</p>
         <p>Survivance is “broached from the moment of the first trace,” in which some other “has me at its disposal: that is where any self is defenseless. That is what the self is, that is what I am, what the <italic>I</italic> is, whether I am there or not,” Derrida observes (2011, 131). From the moment I leave a trace of myself, which is right away (it's the <italic>condition</italic> for any “I” or “myself”), I'm at the mercy of the other, some other, maybe me: the animal that <italic>I am</italic> or that <italic>I follow</italic> or that is <italic>following me</italic>. This survivance is at work<disp-quote>
               <p>for everything from which the tissue of living experience is woven, through and through. A weave of survival, like death in life or life in death, a weave that does not come along to clothe a more originary existence, a life or a body or a soul that would be supposed to exist naked under this clothing. For, on the contrary, they are taken, surprised in advance, comprehended, clothed, they live and die, they live to death as the very inextricability of this weave. (132)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>The gap between me and myself is not that which separates nature from culture but that which “separates nature from nature and culture from culture,” Düttmann writes, where (self-) recognition is demanded <italic>because</italic> it is impossible to “distinguish what is original from what is derived” (2000, 12–13).</p>
         <p>From here, language designates the “codes of traces being designed, among all living beings, to construct the unity of the world that is always deconstructable, nowhere given in nature” (Derrida 2011, 8–9). At the level of these (undead) traces, an irreducible but never simply innate rhetoricity is responsible for the perpetual (re)animation of the life of the living, for “my” life, the <italic>experience</italic> of which can only be both spectral and bereaved. This rhetoricity cannot be innate because it cannot <italic>not</italic> be relational: without an other, a trace of differentiation, there is no need or possibility for self-reference. The I, posing itself in its “living presence,” is already an effect of what we might call this rhetoricity of the living, a specter born each time in an underivable and extrahuman rhetorical relation.</p>
