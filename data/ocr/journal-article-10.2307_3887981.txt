Louis Liebenberg's book, as the title suggests, is certainly not a tracker's field manual, though it may well be used in that capacity too. It is instead a wide-rangi penetrating and stimulating coverage of the theme, situated within extensive multi-disciplinary reading. Tracking and its relation to modern science are the main themes of the book, and are presented within a three-part framework. The first covers the evolution of hunter-gatherer subsistence, the second summarizes data on living hunter-gatherers of the Kalahari (which also includes the author's own observations among the !X6), while the third part concerns the fundamentals of tracking. Tracking is placed in a very wide time perspective, starting with early hominids and the evolution of hominid subsistence activities. Liebenberg believes that tracking most likely evolved in conditions where tracking was easiest, i.e. arid and/or cold areas, and speculates that problems regarding tracking in a changing environment may have contributed to the decline of the Neanderthalers. The section on Kalahari hunter-gatherer subsistence contains data on hunting practices, equipment, the learning process, spoor interpretation and interesting bits of detail from the author's own experience with !X6 hunters. Themes such as the age of spoor, distance, direction, and knowledge of animal behaviour are dis- cussed, while examples of creative speculative thinking of !X6 and other trackers are presented. This is followed (Chapter 6) by a discussion of 'non-scientific' aspects such as presentiments (body signs and feelings about things that are going to happen, danger, proximity of the quarry, etc.), divining and hunting magic, myth and religion. The field tracker will find Chapters 9 and 10 particularly useful as they cover the various signs (spoor, scent, urine and faeces, saliva, pellets, feeding signs, auditory signs, shelters, etc.), as well as variation in spoor based on sex, age, size, activities of animals and environ- mental factors. As the title of the book suggests, Liebenberg links tracking to the origin of science. To him, tracking is a science that requires fundamentally the same intellectual abilities as modern science. Animal life is dynamic and involves a variety of changing variables. This presents a stimulus for inductive-deductive as well as more creative hypothetico-deductive reasoning among hunters, the basis of speculative tracking. This creative thinking is embodied in the formulation of working hypotheses, which enable trackers to go beyond mere amassing of knowledge to the actual explanation of observations and to move into the realm of the unseen. It also involves continuous testing and refining of hypotheses over time, adding to a pool of knowledge. Fundamentally, in his view, tracking and modern science involve the same reasoning processes and intellectual abilities. Anthropomorphic projection in scientific knowledge is a feature of hunter-gatherer populations. Liebenberg points out that this is also true of modern science and concludes that a physicist "thinks like a tracker" (p. 153). Though Liebenberg presents his case well, and while I do not doubt that tracking played an important role in human intellectual development, I find his premise, the 'tracking hypothesis', somewhat reductionist, and would rather seek the origin and development of creative intelli- gence and science in a variety of early human creative</page><page sequence="2">138 South African Archaeological Bulletin 45: 138-140, 1990 enterprises. I am also not particularly attracted to some of his conclusions which suggest universality and/or unilinear development in all places at all times. For instance, he concludes that it is unlikely that early hominids developed the art of tracking, as simple tracking was unlikely before hominids adapted to marginal areas, ideal for tracking (p.36). I am not sure at what stage one can actually speak of an 'art' of tracking, but to me it seems plausible that some hominid popula- tions could also have been conscious of spoor and its meaning in areas less ideal for tracking. Likewise, he feels that cooperative hunting probably only developed after more universal methods were well established (p.23). To me, again, group hunting seems to be a plausible technique of early human populations, given technological deficiencies and possible strong group bonding within adverse environmental and other circum- stances. Liebenberg feels that, because scientific creativity is more spectacular in open/free societies than in authoritarian ones, it "may well be because science had its origin in relatively egalitarian hunter-gatherer societies" (p.165). This I also find a somewhat stretched evolutionism. By and large however, and mindful of the fact that he often operates on a speculative level, Liebenberg presents his data in a convincing manner, even though one does not necessarily agree with all this conclusions. In general, Liebenberg's ethnography seems to be solid, though I cannot recall ever having seen a San arrowhead of porcupine quill (p.56). And I would certainly like to know more about the intriguing possibility that Kalahari San trackers may have a highly developed eidetic imagery (p.74). In addition to its academic merits, the book also has a great deal to offer to people interested in nature conservation and wildlife research. Not only is there a wealth of information on tracking and spoor as such, but also on animal and hunter-gatherer behaviour, supplemented with a variety of illustrations, by the author himself, of spoor and animals. Hunter-gatherers normally stress humility and do not kill for pleasure. In contrast, according to Liebenberg, modern "trophy' hunting is primarily based on boastfulness, which he finds morally questionable. Many hunters may not agree, but the brief discussion of the morality of hunting in a book that should be read by conservationists and hunters (or conservationists/hunters) greatly adds to its value. Those of us who enjoy the outdoors and its wildlife can never be reminded enough of our moral responsibilities and the consequences of our actions. Despite an omission and a misprint or two in the list of references, the book is technically neat and well- produced. The art of tracking is somewhat of a multi-disciplinary tour de force. It is original, well-researched, clear on terminology, gives attention to detail, and makes for stimulating and enjoyable reading. This, indeed, is a book for those who want to read into the sand, and deserves (and should undoubtedly get) a wide readership. H. P.
