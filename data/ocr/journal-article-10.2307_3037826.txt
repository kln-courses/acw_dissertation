BIRGE, Arizona State University, Tempe The genetics of bacteria and their viruses have been the cornerstones of molecular biology since its inception. Innumerable key concepts that are now deeply embedded in modern biology have come from the study of bacterial and bacteriophage genetics. The third edition of this widely-used textbook has been extensively revised to reflect current knowledge in areas such as gene cloning and bacterial evolution, while maintaining the book's strengths in phage genetics, plasmids, and bacterial gene regulation. It will be welcomed by students in genetics, molecular biology, microbi- ology and biotechnology.

The interaction between rhizobia and plants is of enormous agricultural significance, and rhizobia are among the best studied of soil bacteria, the techniques for their analysis having been adopted in laboratories throughout the world. Handbook for Rhizobia is a monumental book of practical methods for working with these bacteria and their plant hosts. Topics include the general microbiological properties of rhizobia and their identification, their potential as symbionts, methods for inoculating rhizobia onto plants, and molecular genetics methods for Rhizobium in the laboratory.

MOFFETT FOREWORD BY E. O. WILSON In The High Frontier, MarkW Moffett does for the tropical rainforest canopy what Jacques Cousteau did thirty years ago for undersea life. Donning rock-climbing gear to join researchers working 150 feet and more above the ground, Moffett photographed strangler trees in Bomeo, giant squir- rels in India, and canopy bears in Colombia. He entered the terrifying world of arboreal spiders and ants, photographing them under extreme magnification. His coverage of this new science is unparalleled. Described as a "world-roving zoolo- gist" by Notional Geographic magazine for his work on five continents, Moffett has documented virtually every major active canopy research site. 133 color photographs cloth $39.95 /paper $24.95 The Chosen Primate Human Nature and Cultural Diversity ADAM KUPER Is there a Darwinian explanation for the evolution of human nature? The great debates about human origins, cultural history, and human nature confront us with two opposing-often irreconcilable images of human beings. One view emphasizes biology, the other emphasizes cul- ture as the foundation of human behavior In The Chosen Primote Adam Kuper reframes these debates and recon- siders the most fundamental questions of anthropology. 21 halftones $27.95 cloth Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge HENRY PLOTKIN Bringing together evolu- tionary biology, psychol- ogy and philosophy, Henry Plotkin presents a new science of knowl- edge, one that traces an unbreakable link between instinct and our ability to know. Since our ability to , know our world depends primarily on what we call intelligence, intelligence must be understood as an extension of instinct. Drawing on contemporary evolutionary theory, Plotkin tells us that the capacity for knowledge, which is what makes us human, is deeply rooted in our biology and, in a special sense, is shared by all living things. $24.95 cloth Identification Guide to the Ant Genera of the World BARRY BOLTON This book, by the world's leading ant taxonomist, offers a definitive guide for identifying these ubiquitous insects. Barry Bofton provides identification keys to all the living ant subfamilies and genera, presented in alphabetical order and separated by zoo- geographical region. Designed for profes- sional and amateur myrmecologists alike, this guide is as accessi- ble as it is comprehen- sive, including informa- tion on the function and use of identification keys, instructions for preparing speci- mens for examination, and an illustrated glossary of mor- phological terms. Over 500 scanning electron microscope photographs illustrate the taxonomic keys. An updated and exhaustively expanded revision of the taxonomic keys found in HolIdobler and Wilson's The Ants, Bolton's identification guide takes its place alongside that landmark work as the foundation for the study of ants for many years to come. 531 halftones $65.00 cloth A View of the River LUNA B. LEOPOLD Luna Leopold, widely regarded as the most creative schol- ar in the field of river morphology, presents in this volume a coherent description of the river, its shape, size, organiza- tion, and action, along with a consistent theory that explains much of the observed character of channels. Grounded in hydraulics, geomorphology, and surveying, as well as in extensive fieldwork on rivers in the eastern and Rocky Mountain states, Leopold's view of a river is at once technical and personal, providing both a firm foundation for understanding the behavior of rivers-including instructions for getting started in backyard hydrology- and a wealth of firsthand observations by a thoughtful and experienced scientist. 24 halftones, 103 line illus., 14 tables $39.95 cloth</page><page sequence="6">The Outer Reaches of Life An Introduction to J.

Theoretical papers should include a critical synthesis of the literature bearing on the theory and promote further research. Both invited and unsolicited articles are considered by The Quarterly, and the Editors encourage the submission of unsolicited articles that conform to the objectives of the journal. An article should be written in concise and sufficiently nontechnical language to be intelligible both to specialists in other fields and to general biologists. Interpretive diagrams are desirable. An article must have a brief abstract that summarizes the principal conclusions of the paper. In most matters of style, articles should conform to the recommendations of The Chicago Manual of Style, Thirteenth Edition, published by The University of Chicago Press (5801 S. Ellis Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637 USA); in respect to the form of references cited, however, authors should see a recent issue of the journal, or request from the office of The Quarterly a detailed set of instructions for the preparation of the list of references. Footnotes to textual material are not permitted, but explanatory material of secondary importance may be set off in the text in small print. Recent issues should be used as a model for style with respect to (1) section headings in the text, (2) literature citations in the text (note that the name-and-date citation form is used), and (3) list of references. Reference citations should be limited to those essential for documenting specific statements. The abbreviations ofjournal titles used in the references section should conform to the BIOSIS List of Serials (BioSciences Information Service of Biological Abstracts, 2100 Arch St., Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA). All entries should give the full title and inclusive page numbers of the articles cited. Authors should provide photocopies of all quoted passages, including page numbers. Send glossy prints of illustrations, but do not send original artwork unless requested to do so. Authors who attribute support to a funding agency with a policy of publication support will be expected to meet charges of $30 per journal page for each of the first 20 journal pages, and $60 for each journal page in excess of 20. Authors not supported by funding agencies and authors of invited articles are eligible for 20 free journal pages (approximately 50 double-spaced typewritten manuscript pages or their equivalent in bibliographic or illustrative matter). When such articles are longer than 20 journal pages, authors will be charged $60 for each page above the allotment of 20 free journal pages. These charges will be used for direct support of the issue in which the article appears. An original and two copies of all articles submitted for consideration should be sent to The Editors, The Quarterly Review of Biology, Division of Biological Sciences, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY 11794-5275 USA. Submission of manuscripts on computer disks or via BITNET (see inside front cover for BITNET address) is encouraged. The file must be IBM compatible or transformable into an ASCII file. Inquire for details. NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS AND SOFTWARE New biological books and software for consideration in this section should be sent to The Editors, The Quarterly Review of Biology, Division of Biological Sciences, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY 11794-5275 USA. COPYING BEYOND FAIR USE The code on the first page of an article in this journal indicates the copyright owner's consent that copies of the article may be made beyond those permitted by Sections 107 and 108 of the U.S. Copyright Law provided that copies are made only for personal or internal use, or for the personal or internal use of specific clients and provided that the copier pay the stated per copy fee through the Copyright Clearance Center, Inc., Operations Center, 27 Congress Street, Salem, MA 01970.
