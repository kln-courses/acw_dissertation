Valentine University of Kansas Ethnohistorical Methodology in Acculturation Research A major area of interest in modern anthropology is the process of contact between historically distinct socie- ties. Anthropologists have been particularly interested in studying acculturation as the special kind of culture change which occurs under such conditions of contact. These interests are part of a broader effort to lay bare the dynamics of social and cultural change in general. Systematic efforts to delimit the scope of contact and acculturation studies began more than twenty years ago. Some of the earliest efforts of this sort emphasized the importance of documentary historical data to accul- turation research. Thus in 1937 M. J. Herskovits, an- thropologist, writing on the significance of contact studies in anthropology, observed that, "In studies of accultura- tion ... recourse to history - actual recorded history ... is mandatory."' In another discussion of accultura- tion research some ten years later the same authority makes explicit reference to "a special technique called 1</page><page sequence="2">2 Ethnohistory the ethnohistorical method," which he describes as "a weld- ing of ethnographic and historical materials." 2 By no means all subsequent investigations of accultu- ration have been historically oriented. In those studies which have employed historical materials, however, vary- ing emphases are apparent. The investigation by Oscar Lewis, anthropologist, of the effects of the fur trade on Blackfoot Indian culture illustrates one type of study in which the data available in documentary sources are ana- lyzed in anthropological terms in order to illuminate a particular problem.3 Another kind of work is exemplified in the anthropologist F. M. Keesing's study of Menomini culture change, in which ethnographic and historical data are brought together to portray the contact history and acculturation of a particular people.4 For the historically oriented anthropologist interested in contact and acculturation, ethnohistory has two impor- tant aspects. First, the value of historical documents as a source of data highly relevant to these interests is rec- ognized. The systematic exploitation of this resource, in conjunction with ethnographic investigation and any other forms of field research found useful in dealing with a particular problem, constitutes an ethnohistorical method. Secondly, the use of such an integrating method leads to a culture-historical description which portrays the development of one or more ethnic groups through time. Such a portrayal may be termed an ethnohistory. The student of acculturation may thus attempt both to employ an ethnohistorical methodology and to write ethnohistories. In the field of contact and acculturation, however, the major concern is not with ethnohistory as an autonomous discipline. The principal interest of</page><page sequence="3">Acculturation 3 analysts of contact histories is rather in employing both ethnohistorical techniques and the results produced by these techniques in order to understand more fully the process of acculturation as such. Understanding the mechanisms of change in contact situations will depend on comparative analysis of numerous particular ethnohis- torical sequences. The following discussion includes illustrations from a recent investigation in which both aspects of ethnohistory were employed in such a way as to supply insights into a contact situation which could not have been gained otherwise. Some suggestions are also made as to a conceptual framework which may be useful in making comparisons with other acculturation situations. Most ethnohistorical treatments of acculturation deal with rather long-term sequences extending well beyond the limits of living memory. In such studies there is inevi- tably a certain lack of fit or consistency between the ma- terials taken from historical sources and the information gleaned by ethnographic methods. Under such conditions the two types of data are not readily comparable or easily integrated. A study of this sort tends to read rather like a history followed by an ethnography. Inferences or theoretical statements which connect one division of the work with the other must be rather tentative and general. This is a difficulty which appears to be inherent in inves- tigations of long-range contact sequences. In non-historical analyses of culture contact and associated change, the data employed are frequently much more comparable and more closely controlled. Compare, for example, the recent work on Menomini acculturation by the anthropologists George and Louise Spindler5 with the earlier investigation by Keesing.6 It</page><page sequence="4">4 Ethnohi story need not be concluded, however, that methodological pre- cision must be confined to non-historical approaches in acculturation research. On the contrary, short-term contact sequences within the compass of living memory provide ideal conditions for adequate control of data on the acculturation process as a whole without sacrificing attention to the historical dimension of the problem. In dealing with problems so defined, both ethnographic and historical evidence bearing on all stages of the accultura- tion sequence can be meaningfully integrated. It is in such a context that ethnohistory can make its greatest contribution to the analysis of culture contact and accul- turation. A Recent Example An investigation of this sort has recently been carried out among the Lakalai people of New Britain in the Terri- tory of New Guinea.7 Direct and intensive contact between the Lakalai and Europeans began a little more than half a century ago, so that practically all significant stages in the process are within the experience of the older living members of Lakalai society. Our study of acculturation in this society was not originally designed as an ethnohis- torical investigation. After field research had been ini- tiated, however, both the strengths and weaknesses of our ethnographic data led us to adopt an ethnohistorical method. This approach also led to an expansion of the scope of our study to include investigation of the alien external interests and institutions impinging on Lakalai society during the contact period. ' Observation of the rapidly changing Lakalai way of life led to many historical questions and suggested</page><page sequence="5">Acculturation 5 various historical hypotheses. The testimony of informants was heavily influenced by temporal conceptions which later turned out to constitute a pseudo-history, but which never- theless also led us to view the contemporary situation in terms of historical depth. We attempted to follow up these leads by probing Lakalai memories. This effort produced a large mass of material of an interesting sort. It con- sisted of a veritable wealth of narrative and contextual detail referring to the last fifty years or so of life in the Lakalai area. It proved quite impossible, however, to analyse or evaluate this material satisfactorily in histori- cal terms. Since Lakalai concepts of time are different from these of the Western world, these data were characterized by a distinct lack of the chronological ordering which is the essence of historicity in its Western sense. Further- more, Lakalai memories of the recent past are structured in terms of a modern mythology, the essentials of which are shared by other Melanesian groups. In this mytholo- gical scheme the precontact past is seen as a lost golden age, the contact period as a time of troubles brought on by European influence, and the future as a rnilenium in which the native society will receive all the wealth, power, and privilege presently reserved for Europeans.9 More- over, the Lakalai were ignorant of most important points of reference in their history which lay outside their own territory. The result of all these factors was that data on the past from native informants, while highly significant for understanding Lakalai acculturation, simply could not be given coherence in a historical sense. Dating of events was impossible. The sequence of occurrences was</page><page sequence="6">6 Ethnohistory frequently telescoped, sometimes reversed, often other- wise confused. The behavior of Europeans was frequently misunderstood and hence distorted. The locations and identifications of important points outside the Lakalai homeland were vague in the extreme. The individual identities and organizational affiliations of Europeans and Asians who played important roles in local history were uncertain or incorrect. In short, this rich material both demanded and at the same time defied historical ordering and evaluation. Leaving the field, we then spent a number of months in Australia carrying out historical research in a large number of sources relevant to New Britain and surround- ing regions. The materials examined included, first, the writings of early explorers who had sailed near New Bri- tain or landed on its coasts.10? Secondly, the accounts and personal memoirs of later travelers and residents in the area were found useful."l Missionary writings, including diaries, autobiographies, and periodical reports formed a third indispensable category of sources.12 In the fourth place, all available records of the several governments which have been involved in New Britain affairs at various times were examined.13 Fifthly, military documents and published accounts of the various armed forces which have carried out operations on the island were used ex- tensively.14 Systematic attention was given, in the sixth place, to newspaper files and collections of other non- official periodicals.15 A number of scholarly secondary sources constituted a seventh resource of considerable utility.16 Finally, interviews and correspondence with living Europeans and Asians - including administrators, missionaries, and private settlers - who have played</page><page sequence="7">Acculturation 7 a part themselves in the acculturation of New Britain peoples were also employed as sources of information. On the basis of the materials obtained in these ways, it was possible to draw up both a detailed chronological record17 and an atlas18 of New Britain's contact history as seen from the European point of view. Most significant events, locations, organizations and personalities were identified and placed in their proper contexts as far as the European side of the contact relationship was concerned. In addition, a large amount of material on European and Asian attitudes and behavior in the island situation was collected. Finally, all available statistical records per- taining to New Britain were brought together and collated.19 During the same period much of the material which had been collected in the course of the first field trip was also written up in preliminary form.20 We then returned to New Britain taking the results of both our documentary research and our previous field study with us. Our ethnographic investigation into the Lakalai past now entered a new phase. The chronology and other documentary data were employed as a basis for inquiries and as a framework for checking and organizing informant material forthcoming from both volunteered statements and arranged interviews. It was also found useful to encourage a biographical approach on the part of infor- mants relating narratives of past events. Our detailed knowledge of local history from external sources not only served as an objective check on native testimony, but as people became aware that we had this knowledge their awareness also encouraged many of them to work toward alien standards of historicity in giving material. With selected informants it was even possible to come to a</page><page sequence="8">8 Ethnohistory sort of understanding that we were dealing with two dif- ferent orders of the past, corresponding to a historical reality as opposed to a mythological reality. By these and other methods we succeeded in obtaining from Lakalai sources accounts of practically all important events, personalities and developments recorded by Euro- peans, as well as much related material of which alien recorders were unaware. Full expressions of native atti- tudes toward and interpretations of the developing con- tact situation were also brought out. The filling of gaps, straightening out of confusion, and elimination of distor- tion in Lakalai testimony were not the only results. Many errors in European records, as well as much ignorance, prejudice and misinterpretation of native behavior on the part of European commentators were also corrected. Our growing understanding of Lakalai culture and increasing first-hand acquaintance with alien society in the islands were indispensable background for this process of inte- grating ethnographic and documentary data. Through in- tensive work of this sort ever a period of several months the two sets of data were checked against each other in most respects. The major sources of confusion, igno- rance and distortion from both sides were finally rectified for the most part. The resulting information was of course neither totally exhaustive nor absolutely free from doubt as to its validity. An account based on either type of source alone, however, would have been so incomplete or misleading in important respects as to be of little value. Carefully integrated information from both types of data yielded the materials for a detailed and systema- tic contact history.21</page><page sequence="9">Acculturation 9 Brief Illustrations of Results One or two more concrete examples may make this somewhat abstract presentation more meaningful. Con- sider, for instance, the earliest significant direct con- tacts between the Lakalai people and Europeans. A number of points will make it clear that adequate know- ledge of such events can be obtained only by combining accounts from both parties to these initial confrontations of two societies. First, this meeting of peoples had for each side a distinct historical, cultural and circumstan- tial background. Not only this, but the members of each group were almost totally ignorant of such background factors on the other side. Secondly, and partly because of the conditions stated in the first point, sources of in- formation from each side of the confrontation present quite different kinds of data on these important events. Among the questions about which much could be learned from European sources were the following. When these initial contacts occurred: about 50 years ago. Who the Europeans involved were: German and/or English labor recruiters. What their purpose in the area was: to obtain plantation workers. How they worked: often by force and violence. About native behavior in the situation little: only that the Lakalai fled from the Europeans. What the results for the aliens were: no recruits were obtained at first but knowledge was gained of a comparatively dense population for future exploita- tion.22 These same alien sources, however, could tell us little or nothing with respect to details of or reasons for the native response in the situation, the meaning of the contact in native experience, or the effects on the native society which resulted.</page><page sequence="10">10 Ethnohi story From Lakalai sources, on the other hand, it was possible to gain a large amount of information which ef- fectively complemented that just described. Here we obtained first a complex of data which makes clear the meaning of this contact experience for the Lakalai and their response to it. The central point in this connection turned out to be the Lakalai identification of Europeans as powerful supernatural beings with an unknown but quite possibly malevolent character. The chief cultural factor in this interpretation was a traditional pantheon of simi- lar anthropomorphic supernaturals regularly invoked to explain or make meaningful otherwise unaccountable events. The chief circumstantial factors involved were that the Lakalai had previously observed European ships sailing by in the distance, before there had been any landings on their coast 23 and these apparitions had al- ready been associated with a recent small pox epidemic which was believed to have come from the spirit world. In the second place, interviews with informants, carried out against a background of knowledge of the traditional culture, supplied the necessary information for understanding the effects of this first contact ex- perience on Lakalai society. The immediate effect was the introduction into the Lakalai universe of a new class of beings. This was followed by the development of new ritual procedures to deal with these beings, as well as the founding of a new mythological system to account for their appearance. As for the long-range effects, the central point is that this initial identification of the aliens as denizens of the spirit world with an equivocal nature has conditioned the deeply ambivalent Lakalai view of Europeans to this day. The ambivalence that arose in</page><page sequence="11">Acculturation 11 this context has found its most recent and dramatic ex- pression in the ideology of certain modern religious movements which will be noted again in another connec- tion. A brief consideration of the history of Christianity in the Lakalai area will provide a second illustration of perhaps wider significance. European sources, chiefly mission documents, tell us much about the personnel and organization which brought Christianity to the Lakalai.24 On the basis of these materials we are able to follow missionary activities in some detail from the first arrival of churchmen attached to each of the denominations in- volved. The organizational structure, yearly expansion, methods employed, dogmas preached and attitudes sub- scribed to can be described for each church body. The personalities of several individual missionaries can be differentiated. On the other hand, the picture of the Lakalai response to these influences which emerges from mission records is of very limited usefulness. It consists mainly of a generally misunderstood or unex- plained series of fluctuations in the fortunes of each church organization, together with many uncritical con- structs relating to the nature of native personality and culture. This picture was made far more meaningful by the addition of information of the following sort from Laka- lai sources. Well before 1922 when the first resident European missionaries settled in their area, the Laka- lai people were already in the process of becoming com- mitted to a local form of syncretistic Christianity. This development had taken place chiefly through the diffusion and reinterpretation of Christian elements</page><page sequence="12">12 Ethnohistory from European centers in other parts of the island area. This process of diffusion was largely mediated by inden- tured laborers returning home from already missionized regions after the expiration of their work contracts. When missionary churchmen did come to the Lakalai area, therefore, the native society readily offered allegiance to the alien church as the superior cult of a dominant deity. Christianity thus rapidly came to be regarded as a new and more effective defense against the threats of the traditional Lakalai world. It was in this wise that the new faith became superimposed upon, in fact drew much of its local strength from, the concepts and beliefs of traditional Lakalai supernaturalism. Christianity was thus far from destroying or repla- cing the native religious system. Once incorporated in this manner into Lakalai life, however, the new faith soon came to be valued primarily as a supernatural means to achieving full enjoyment of all the advantages of the European way of life as seen in the islands. To describe simply what was actually a complex development, it may be said that the Lakalai were profoundly disillu- sioned when this seeming promise of Christianity failed to materialize. Again summarizing a complicated pro- cess, we may say that the changing native society next turned to a violent mass movement with both religious and political aims and directed in part against the mis- sions. This was a millenarian movement similar in general pattern to the now famous cargo cults common in other parts of Melanesia as well.25 After the failure of this cult, there was a strong tendency to explain its collapse primarily in terms of its repudiation of Christianity. Subsequently the Lakalai</page><page sequence="13">Acculturation 13 have once more become devoted mission adherents, but their Christianity is still combined in an elaborate and shifting pattern both with remaining traditional beliefs and with a still desperate faith in the cargo millenium. Such in very brief form is the picture to be gained from native informants and from observation of contemporary Lakalai religious behavior. This picture could not be given sequential and chronological coherence and could not be objectively related to the facts of mission practice, however, without the information available only in Euro- pean records.26 Thus only by piecing together an ethno- historical account from sources on both sides of the con- tact relationship can an investigator find meaningful order in a changing situation which is not fully understand- able from either side alone. Considerations of Conceptual Framework Such a synthesizing ethnohistorical approach also has additional potentialities. By providing data on both native and alien groups in the New Britain study, it opened up the possibility of conceptualizing the whole contact situation in terms of a single social system. In New Britain, the social relations of contact are largely structured in terms of a three-caste hierarchy of Euro- pean, Asian, and native Melanesian groups. Such a view of the contract scene enables one to see the whole population of the island, both native and alien, as a single contact society. This unity is characterized by regular and describable patterns of interaction among the groups or castes which make up the over-all social system. Thus, a more inclusive structural order may replace the simpler view of two or more independent</page><page sequence="14">14 Ethnohistory social systems in peripheral contact with each other. This conceptualization would not be possible without adequate data for each of the groups included in the larg- er system. Only through an ethnohistorical methodology can the origin and development of such a contact social system be traced. Through the use of such an approach, however, a dynamic but enduring structural matrix, with- in which the acculturation process takes place, can be recognized and analyzed.27 Another development of conceptual framework which grew out of the detailed tracing of recent Lakalai history was the discernment of repeated cultural crises during the development of contact. One such crisis situation was the disillusionment with Christianity already described. The response to this crisis was, as we have seen, the emergence of a new religious cult which constituted an adaptation to the contact conditions of the time. In the course of the whole contact history, six crises have been identified, characterized in each case by a sharp realization on the part of the people that their way of life was inadequate to satisfy needs which they felt as urgent. In each case, the crisis was followed by a re- solution which took the form of rapid and significant cultural innovation. These innovating resolutions of crises situations, however partial or inadequate from an objective point of view, constituted the major occa- sions for rapid change in the whole acculturation pro- cess. The identification of this series of crises and reso- lutions gives coherence and order to the whole develop- ment of Lakalai acculturation. The organization of Lakalai life at each stage of resolution represents a</page><page sequence="15">Acculturation 15 partially distinct cultural integration. That is to say, the innovations following each crisis established a way of life which embodied both new features and elements of con- tinuity with the past. The distinctive features of Lakalai culture at each stage of reintegration can be portrayed through ethnographic description. Moreover, the his- torical connections between phases can be fully set forth in terms of the intervening events and developments. Thus the whole contact and acculturation process is rendered coherent in terms of both historical and cultural analysis. It is apparent that such a result could not have been achieved without the full resources of data provided by an ethnohistorical method.28 Summary The employment of ethnohistory in a specific accul- turation study has been set in its methodological context and illustrated briefly. While such a study was not originally intended as an ethnohistorical investigation, the nature of the data forthcoming from field research required the examination of historical materials. The systematic integration of evidence produced by both ethnographic and historiographic techniques was made possible by the short-term nature of the developments under study. This integration of materials from diverse sources laid the basis for a description of a whole con- tact history with considerably greater accuracy, coher- ence and comprehensiveness than would have been possible from either anthropological or historical data alone. In the analysis of these acculturation develop- ments, certain elements of conceptual framework were employed which may constitute a step in the direction of</page><page sequence="16">16 Ethnohistory general concepts useful in comparing acculturation se- quences in different parts of the world. These illustra- tions were thus designed to suggest some ways in which anthropologists interested in acculturation processes may work towards a more general understanding of these processes by employing an ethnohistorical method and writing ethnohistories.

Mrs. Valentine and I spent the periods of April through October 1954, and April through November, 1956, in field research in New Britain, chiefly among the La- kalai. During the intervening year and a half we car- ried out historical research mainly in Australia,</page><page sequence="17">Acculturation 17 relating to the same area. Further documentary research was accomplished in Philadelphia and New York in 1957. During the 1954 expedition we were members of a team of anthropologists whose work was sponsored by the Uni- versity Museum and the Department of Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. This portion of the study received financial aid from the American Philosophical Society and the Tri-Institutional Pacific Program. I was a Fulbright scholar at the Australian National University for the first two years of our work. On the second expe- dition when Mrs. Valentine and I returned alone to New Britain, we were again supported by the University of Pennsylvania and the University Museum, and on this oc- casion we received further financial assistance from the Australian National University. We wish to acknowledge gratefully the courtesy, help, and hospitality which were extended to us by the Administration of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and by many residents of the Ter- ritory. Our thanks are also due to the staffs of several libraries and archival institutions in Australia and in this country for research assistance and facilities. I am further grateful for assistance and suggestions from other members of the anthropological team which inves- tigated Lakalai society, particularly W. H. Goodenough and M. A. Chowning. 8. The wider historical and sociocultural context of Lakalai acculturation is described and analysed in Valen- tine, An Introduction to the History of Changing Ways of Life. 9. These beliefs reflect Lakalai participation in a local form of the widespread modern Melanesian reli- gious movements known as cargo cults, the most com- prehensive account of which is to be found in Worsley, The Trumpet Shall Sound. 10. E. g., Belcher, Narrative of a Voyage; Bougain- ville, A Voyage Around the World; Dampier, Voyages and Discoveries; D'Entrecasteaux, Voyages; D'Urville,</page><page sequence="18">18 Ethnohistory Voyage Autour du Monde; Morrell, Narrative of a Voyage; Powell, Wanderings in a Wild Country; von Schleinitz, Begleitworte zur Karte. The sources listed here and in footnotes 11- 16 are offered as a sample of the kind of ma- terial found useful. Examination of these 18th- and 19th- century explorers' accounts established the fact that the Lakalai coast was virtually unknown to Europeans before the opening of the present century. 11. E.g., Cayley-Webster, Through New Guinea; Hochberg, An Eastern Voyage; Lindt, Picturesque New Guinea; Lyng, Our New Possession; Mackellar, Scented Isles; Matches, Savage Paradise; Overell, A Woman's Impressions; Pullen-Bury, In a German Colony; Romilly, From My Verandah. None of these sources contains much information on the Lakalai as such, but all are revealing as to the extent of European expansion and the nature of the contact society of which the Lakalai became a part. 12. E.g., Annals of Our Lady; Bley, Die Herz-Jesu- Mission; Brown, Autobiography; Danks, A Brief History; Deane, In Wild New Britain; Huskes, Pioniere der Sudsee; Lewis, The First Sixty Years; Missionary Review; Methodist Missionary Society of Australasia, Report, Report and Balance Sheet, Annual Report; and unpub- lished mission records. From these sources the history of relevant missionary organizations, both within and beyond the Lakalai area, can be traced in considerable detail. 13. E. g., Germany, Annual Report; Germany, Deutches Kolonialblatt; Australia, Reports to the League of Nations; Australia, Reports to the General Assembly; Territory of New Guinea, Government Gazette; Terri- tory of New Guinea, New Guinea Gazette; unpublished patrol reports, reports of investigations, etc. The im- portance of official documents of course extends far beyond the minority of reports devoted to the Lakalai area, for this category of sources contains voluminous</page><page sequence="19">Acculturation 19 evidence of the changing wider political, legal, and policy contexts within which Lakalai society must confront the modern world. 14. E.g., ANGAU, War Diaries, Reports, etc; ATIS, SWPA, Enemy Publications, Bulletins, Miscellaneous Documents; Feldt, The Coast Watchers; Selby, Hell and High Fever; U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey. Here is provided evidence not only of the nature of military oper- ations in or near the Lakalai area, but also of the larger patterns of the two conflicts which have touched New Bri- tain, without which the effects on Lakalai society cannot be understood. 15. E. g., The Pacific Islands Monthly, The Rabaul Times, and The South Pacific Post, each of which con- tains much material which is revealing as to the non- official European society in the islands with which the Lakalai must deal. 16.

The results of this work, insofar as they pertain to New Britain as a whole rather than to the Lakalai spe- cifically, are contained in Valentine, An Introduction to the History of Changing Ways of Life. The specifically Lakalai material is in process of being written up, with two early results contained in Valentine, The Changing Spirit World of the Lakalai and Valentine, Religion and Culture Change. Other writings which have come out of the Lakalai study are not for the most part ethnohistori- cally oriented. These include Chowning, Lakalai Society; Chowning and Goodenough, Lakalai Political Organization; Goodenough, The Pageant of Death in Nakanai; Valentine, The Traditional Religious System of the Lakalai. 22. This is an instance of the use of indirect evidence from European sources. The picture just summarized had to be pieced together from accounts of the situation in the late 19th century, in New Britain generally, con- tained in Brown, Cayley-Webster, Deane, Powell, Romilly, and several others, plus the situation around the turn of the century as described by Brown, Cox, Danks, German Annual Reports, Lewis, Reche, von Schleinitz, and others. No direct European account of the first arrivals of labor recruiters on the Lakalai coast has been discovered. The chronology and other details inferred from the sources just noted agree with native memory as represented by a number of consistent spontaneous accounts and the results of subsequently questioning informants. 23. Confirmed by the first-hand accounts of voyages along this coast contained in Belcher, Powell, Remilly, and others, as well as the information on shipping set forth in the German Annual Reports. 24. E. g., Annals of Our Lady, Bley, Danks, Deane,</page><page sequence="21">Acculturation 21 Huskes, Lewis, Missionary Review, Reports of the Meth- odist Missionary Society. In this case the evidence is quite direct, consisting of thoroughly circumstantial and fairly detailed accounts of the activities of both the Ger- man Catholic Sacred Heart Mission and the Australian Wesleyan Methodist Mission in the Lakalai area. 25.
