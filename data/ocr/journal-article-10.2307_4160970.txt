<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIRDS AND THEIR WAYS. By Alexander Dawes Du Bois with Charlotte A. Du Bois. T.S. Denison &amp; Co., Minneapolis, Minnesota, 1976. 184 pp., 81 black and white photos. $8.95.-Intended as a companion to the author's earlier work, Glimpses of Bird Life, this book consists of two parts. Part I is an anecdotal and haphazard account of various species encountered during the author's lifelong pursuit of birds (one early account is on a horse drawn mail stage). Birds were observed in many parts of North America, although most observations are from around the author's Minnesota home or near Cornell University. Topics such as nesting, care of young, feeding, song, and sociality are discussed. Part II is a more detailed description of the lives of a dozen favorite species. With the exception of a blurred kingfisher on p. 16, a spotted photo on p. 127, and a repetitive series of woodpecker holes, the photographs are of good quality and add to the text. These pictures, taken from a blind by the author, are illustrative of his devotion to birds and photography. A major criticism is with the constant anthropomorphic interpretation of birds' actions: a bluebird "had sung to instill courage in his two fearful young, to give them promise of safety, and hope of food as a reward." A Red-headed Woodpecker showed so much grief at his wounded mate, "that I shot him also, out of compassion." Some of the wording is awkward: "All these hazards birds have no way of coping with," while other material is stilted: a bathing tanager is likened to "a flame trying to extinguish itself." This book will have a limited appeal since it is neither visually impressive enough for the coffee table trade nor rigorously scientific.-DAVID R. MAURER.</page></plain_text>
