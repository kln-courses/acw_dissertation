<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chronotypic tension in Bulgarian prehistory: 6500-3500 BC Douglass W. Bailey Chronotypes: Models or patterns through which time assumes practical or conceptual significance, they are themselves temporal and plural, constantly being made and remade at multiple individual, social and cultural levels. They interact with one another, sometimes cooperatively, sometimes conflictually. (Bender and Wellbery 1991: 4) From the Neolithic to the early Bronze Age, Bulgarian prehistory is marked by two chronotypes of human behaviour: one cyclical in nature, the other linear. These chronotypes dictated most social action from 6500 to 3500 BC and are well documented by calendars, record keeping, the organization of production and the organization of society, the management of economic resources, the treatment of the deceased and the organization of habitation strategies. For the majority of this period the two opposing chronotypes coexisted co-operatively, each driving different elements in society. During the Chalcolithic Period (4700-3800 BC) a tension arose between the two. The increasing conflict and tension between chronotypes resulted in a shift from the coexistence of two systems to the predominance of one, the linear chronotype. The predominance of the linear chronotype is marked by a major break in cultural and social patterning around 3500 BC, the beginning of the early Bronze Age. The cyclical chronotype Cyclical organization of time and society is a characteristic of European social organization since at least 35,000 BC. Inferences drawn from modern ethnographic work on hunter-gatherers and the interpretation of faunal remains from Upper Palaeolithic sites document strategies of resource management and exploitation founded on repeated cycles of animal and plant availability. Binford, Woodburn and others have built models for complex foraging and hunting groups (applicable to both the Upper Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic) in which the hunter-gatherer groups plan their manipulation of the resources available to them. Thus for Binford, groups occupy different locations (base camps, field camps and cache sites) as the schedule of their needs, as well as the schedule of their prey, dictates (Binford 1980).

Certainly these practices existed in the Upper Palaeolithic, if not in earlier periods (Legge 1972; Jarman 1972; Higgs and Jarman 1969; 1972; Sturdy 1972; Bahn 1977; 1983; 1984; 1990; but see also White 1985; 1989). For Woodburn, and for others such as Testart, complex hunter-gatherer groups plan their activities with special reference to storage and the cyclicity of both their needs and the availability of resources (Woodburn 1980; 1982; Testart 1982). The recent work of Rowley-Conwy on Mesolithic communities in north-western Europe supports a model of hunter-gatherer social complexity which is based on knowledge and ability to predict cyclical patterns of resource exploitation and settlement relocation (Rowley-Conwy 1983; 1986). The ability to predict the availability patterns of a seasonally changing pool of wild resources allowed societies such as the Erteb0lle in Denmark to maintain a comfortable non-agricultural life-style beyond the date of the availability of domesticated plant and animal stocks. Erteb0lle groups moved between permanent base settlements and special purpose camps on a seasonal basis, engaging in economically specialized exploitation of resources (Rowley-Conwy 1986: 25; 1983). Suggestions of seasonal mobility to exploit a particular set of resources have been put forward by Binford for the Eskimo (Binford 1980) and for Europeans by Gamble (Gamble 1978). There have been suggestions that Mesolithic Europeans herded red deer as if they were domesticates (Jarman 1972; Chaplin 1975). While Rowley-Conwy has cautioned against the likelihood of the domestication of red or roe deer (due to the difference in animal behaviour between roe and red deer on the one hand and sheep and cattle on the other (Rowley-Conwy 1986:26)), much of the success of the Mesolithic and Palaeolithic hunter-gathers exploitation of species such as deer was due to the knowledge of seasonal animal movement and breeding behaviour. The Erteb0lle, like other complex hunter-gather groups (Northwest Coast Indians, Bering Straits Eskimo, North Alaska Eskimo and the Japanese Ainu), lived in environments where several species of migratory mammals (especially birds and fish) appeared at different times of the year (Rowley-Conwy 1983: 112). Additional work on the Mesolithic sites of the Danube Gorges of central and eastern Europe (e.g. Lepenski Vir, Vlasac) has documented the existence of pre-agricultural communities which thrived on similarly predictable patterns of locally exploitable resources (river fish, deer, pig, wild ox, wild cat, badger and lynx). These sites were occupied on a semi-permanent annual basis (Kaiser and Voytek 1983) by groups which managed local deer populations and selectively slaughtered pigs (Boroneant 1989: 475). Voytek and Tringham have argued for the storage of resources at sites in the Gorges, especially smoked fish at Vlasac II and III and of other goods at other sites (Voytek and Tringham 1989: 493, 498). With the beginning of the classic European Neolithic, cyclical exploitation of wild (or more accurately 'managed-wild' animal resources) was intensified to include seasonal and annual exploitation of domesticated animals (sheep, goat, pig and cattle) and plants (cereals, pulses and legumes). While evidence for the cyclical planning of resource exploitation and community organization from the Upper Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic is indirect in nature (i.e. they are inferred from the ratios of faunal remains, movement of settlement, location of shell middens, and presence of floral and faunal seasonal identifiers) the evidence for cyclical planning during the Neolithic is more direct.</page><page sequence="3">206 Douglass W. Bailey The Bulgarian evidence documenting successful adherence to cycles of resource management during the Neolithic is especially clear and is of four types: inventories of bone, antler, flint, stone and ceramic tools and the botanical and faunal remains to which these tools were dedicated; treatment of the deceased; settlement practice; and calendars. Neolithic tool inventories reflect the early farming activities of their owners. Antler picks and hoes were used to prepare the soil for planting and to tend the plants while they grew. Flint blades have been identified as sickles (on the basis of silica gloss on their edges) used either on their own or hafted, in a line, on bone or antler, to form a scythe. Flat and cupped stones were used as grinding platforms and mortar and pestles. Ceramic pots and clay silos are frequently found in the houses of the period (Fig. 1). In his analysis of botanical remains from Chavdar and Kazanluk in central Bulgaria, Dennell recovered evidence of a crop rotation system based on cereals and pulses (Dennell 1978: 112). Most houses had ovens; many of the ovens were used for processing grains for storage (sieving and carbonizing (Dennell 1972: 152)), for facilitating winnowing (parching to free kernels from husks (Dennell 1972: 154)), for baking bread, or for all of these activities. Almost every settlement from Neolithic Bulgaria (especially in the south of the country) reveals evidence of the planting, harvesting, processing and storage of cereal grains. Planting, harvesting and storage are factors integrally dependent on accurate prediction of temporal cycles. Planting is successful only if carried out at a specific time of year. Knowledge of cereal growth rates permits successful harvesting. Knowledge and tracking of the shelf-life of stored cereals enables replanting. The life of an agriculturalist can only succeed in association with a knowledge of annual, seasonal and intra-seasonal cycles. Arguing that much temperate European early agricultural life succeeded by taking advantage of the short period of optimum ground water present between winter floods and summer desiccation, Sherratt suggests that crops were grown during the spring (Sherratt 1980). 0 r .... .

Nikolov 1990).</page><page sequence="4">Chronotypic tension in Bulgarian prehistory 207 Like agricultural production, the management of domesticated animal stock for meat and secondary products requires the ability to predict specific cycles of time. Neolithic economies are marked not only by the appearance of domesticated ovicaprid, pig and cattle but by the high percentages of domesticated to wild animals exploited. To have successfully maintained these high domestic to wild ratios Neolithic breeders required precise knowledge of animal mating schedules and gestation periods. Once these breeders began managing their herds for products other than meat (i.e. secondary products (Sherratt 1981)) the knowledge of cyclical schedules increased and dependence on successful tracking of these cycles intensified. While efficient breeding for meat may have required relatively simple management and culling strategies based on sex (retaining more females than males) and age (retaining only breeding stock beyond most efficient weight to feed ratio), breeding for secondary products required comprehension of more complex cycles. Dennell argues for secondary product exploitation at Kazanluk and Chavdar: selective culling of ovicaprid between 3 and 5 years; killing of pigs in their second year; separation of young from old cattle (Dennell 1978). Thus production of dairy products (documented by ceramic dairying sieves) required knowledge of lactation periods. The production of textiles from wool (documented by loom weights, spindle whorls and pattern impressions) required knowledge of wool growth rates and fleecing cycles. Evidence for the cyclical chronotype during the Bulgarian Neolithic is not limited to the economies of the communities but includes the organization of habitation and the treatment of the deceased. Cyclical time is evident in Neolithic settlement practices in two ways. First, settlement tells in the southern central part of the country were occupied on a seasonal basis (e.g. Karanovo, Chavdar, Yunatsite). Traditional interpretations of these settlements hold that occupations of the tells was continuous, sometimes for periods in excess of a thousand years. Recent research by Todorova and others on the specifics of house rebuilding and repair and the use of so-called fortification walls as barriers against seasonal floods (Todorova 1982; Todorova etal. 1983; Bailey 1990) shows that tell occupation was most probably seasonal or annual, with interruptions in habitation by small-scale abandonments to avoid seasonal flooding or to facilitate summer upland grazing strategies (as suggested for summer grazing of sheep and goat (Dennell 1972: 151)). The second evidence of cyclical occupation of settlement is found in north-east Bulgaria. Tell formation characteristic of the Neolithic is only found in the southern regions of the country. To the north settlement was based, as it had been in the Mesolithic, on semi-permanent pit dwellings spread along low river terraces (e.g. at Usoe and Podgoritsa). While the limited information published on settlements of this type constricts our observations, it appears that Neolithic habitation in north-eastern Bulgaria followed the Erteb0lle model of seasonal and intra-seasonal movements and reoccupations in accordance with migratory animal species (I. Angelova, personal communication). In addition to its place in strategies of Neolithic settlement, the cyclic chronotype is also evident in the Neolithic treatment of the dead. Individuals were interred within the domestic space (beneath house floors, in habitation pits) or in clay source pits immediately adjacent to the domestic space. Little if any effort was made to distinguish individuals in burial; few if any grave goods accompanied corpses, and clay figurines, made to represent the deceased, were simply ornamented and were very few in number. The burial of the</page><page sequence="5">208 Douglass W. Bailey deceased in the space of the living suggests that the purpose of burial ritual was to include the dead and inanimate in the space of the living and animate household. In this manner the life cycle revolved around the house. The body interred within it, or near it, began a new life in association with the house and its inhabitants. The placement of the dead within the domestic space was also a characteristic of the Danube Gorge Mesolithic and may have been characteristic of earlier burial ritual, although the identification of relationships between burial and domestic spaces during the Upper Palaeolithic has aroused recent debate (Gargett 1989; Louwe Kooijmans et al. 1989). With the exception of burial ritual, all strategies based on the cyclical chronotype during the Neolithic are intensified during the Chalcolithic. The evidence for agricultural production, processing and storage increases in quantity: large storage vessels abound, grain silos are more evident, almost all houses have grinding stones and at least one oven (Fig. 2). With respect to animal management, the evidence for secondary products exploitation increases in quantity (Vasilev 1985; Todorova 1986; Bailey 1991). Large numbers of loom weights are found at most sites, ceramic sieves increase in appearance, and zoomorphic figurines (e.g. from Ovcharovo and Drama) suggests that cattle were used Figure 2 Late Chalcolithic habitation horizon from Ovcharovo showing ovens, silos and house associations (after Todorova et al. 1983).</page><page sequence="6">Chronotypic tension in Bulgarian prehistory 209 for transportation (see Bailey 1991). Increases in agricultural production may document cattle use to pull ploughs. The discovery of cattle with splayed phalanges at Vadastra in south-western Romania supports the use of cattle for traction by the late Neolithic (Ghetie and Mateescu 1973; Mateescu 1975). While detailed age profiles for cattle are not available from many of the major Bulgarian tells, the evidence from Ovcharovo documents a shift to older animals (four years and older) in the middle and late phases (Karanovo V and Karanovo VI/A) of the site's occupation (Vasilev 1985; Bailey 1991). With respect to habitation, use of Neolithic tells continues in the south and new settlement mounds develop in the north (e.g. Ovcharovo, Polyanitsa, Turgovishte, Podgoritsa). Similar patterns of occupation to those noted in the Neolithic (i.e. marked by short-term abandonment and reoccupation) are documented in the Chalcolithic. Sherratt argues that tells were located on flood plains to take advantage of the optimal levels of water available between winter floods and summer desiccation (Sherratt 1980: 317). The most striking evidence for the cyclical chronotype during the Chalcolithic are the seasonal and annual calendars. Four types of calendars have been recovered: calendar grids; 'altar' decoration; cave painting; and the so-called cult pillars. Only one calendar grid has been recovered from a Chalcolithic settlement in Bulgaria, at the Gradeshnitsa Culture site of Slatino in the western part of the country (Chokhadzhiev 1984; 1986: 190). The grid is inscribed on the bottom of an oven model, of which many were recovered from the site, and is divided into six columns of ten rows each (Fig. 3). The sixty fields of the grid are decorated in three ways (incised vertical lines; incised horizontal and vertical lines or red ochre) or are left blank. Chokhadzhiev argues that the twelve ochre fields represent months. Different combinations of blank and incised fields divide the sequence of twelve months into three groups. The first group of months represents winter, the second group spring and summer and the third autumn (Chokhadzhiev 1984). The calendar also notes the progress of days in a month, the days being divided by phase of the moon represented by incised fields. It is significant in implicating the calendar grid in agricultural production to note that each house at Slatino contained a grinding stone and an oven. Excavation of the site also produced abundant evidence for spinning and weaving. The second category of calendars from Chalcolithic Bulgaria are represented by the three decorated 'altars' from Ovcharovo in the north-eastern part of the country 11111 4 III 11 -ml II III 4I I III __ I I I lll il III ilia i!I II 1111 Ii Figure 3 Calendar grid from Slatino.

(Todorova et al. 1983; Koleva 1986; V. Nikolov 1991). The face of each altar is painted with symbols of the sun, the moon and thunder. A series of lines painted on each edge of these altars mark the daily and monthly passage of time (Koleva 1986) (Fig. 4). Koleva interprets these lines as representing a 365 day year divided into two periods, one 281 days in length consisting of spring, summer and autumn, and a second period 84 days in length representing winter. On the other hand, Vasil Nikolov has argued that the altar calendars represent only the period from the spring equinox until the beginning of July; that is, those periods most important for the development of summer crops (V. Nikolov 1991). While Koleva and Nikolov disagree on the periodization, both agree that the solar and floral imagery on the sides of the altar calendars link the altars to cyclical prediction strategies for agricultural production. The remaining two types of calendars, the cult pillars and the cave art, are less definitely identified as calendars. The identification of the cult pillars (Fig. 5) as calendars rests on an imaginative reconstruction of pillar function in marking the summer solstice on the horizon (V. Nikolov 1991; Nedelchev 1991). Possible solar images on the pillars (circles with jagged edges) are offered to confirm the pillar's use in predicting solar movement and seasonal scheduling. It is equally unclear whether the cave art clearly serves calendric purposes. Stojchev and Stoev have argued that a linear display of images painted on the walls of a cave in northern Bulgaria represent an annual calendar (Stojchev and Stoev 1991). Stojchev and Stoev suggest that the imagery included in the wall painting (e.g. solar and astral imagery) represents different seasons and important phases of the agricultural year and that the sequence of the art on the cave wall is intended to guide the viewer</page><page sequence="8">Chronotypic tension in Bulgarian prehistory 211 /X &lt;- /Figure 5 Cult Pillar from Polyanitsa; f Vj )"y Y^ S/ 10.2 cm x 3.0 cm (after Bonev 1976) Figure 6 Early Neolithic stamps from Slatina: 0 0 ,^^ ~/r \ ~ / ~a) with double parallel zig-zags; and b) double ended with triple parallel zig-zags (after V.

Gerasimova-Tomova has also discussed cave imagery, representing events relating to a solar calendar (e.g. sun, moon and eclipse), which she believes is calendric, although the dating places the images closer to the Iron Age than the Chalcolithic (Gerasimova-Tomova 1991; Gerasimova-Tomova etal. 1991). Without a definite chronology for the cave painting, without evidence that the calendar images were made at the same time and thus were intended to be considered together, and without more critical studies of the cult pillars, it is difficult to place either the cave calendars or the cult pillars in the corpus of Chalcolithic calendars. Regardless of the validity of the last two categories, the recovery of calendar grids and the altar calendars is significant documentation of cyclical time management in the Bulgarian Chalcolithic. Indeed, the complete inventory of evidence (calendars; animal and plant management; short term habitation abandonment and reoccupation; and burial practice) makes it clear that Neolithic and Chalcolithic social strategies were heavily committed to a cyclical chronotype. The linear chronotype While the cyclical organization of social strategies is evident from the Bulgarian Neolithic and Chalcolithic (and possibly also from the Upper Palaeolithic), it is equally clear that a linear chronotype drove other aspects of the same social communities at these times. The evidence for linear organization centres around three fundamental strategies of social behaviour: permanent record keeping; burial ritual (during the Chalcolithic) for the maintenance of social continuity; and the creation and long term maintenance of tell settlements. Record keeping Two forms of record keeping existed in Bulgaria during the Neolithic and the Chalcolithic: stamp seals (often referred to as 'pintaderas') and symbolic inscriptions on pot bases. Stamps appear in the archaeological record from the early Neolithic to the end of the Chalcolithic and the early Bronze Age (e.g. Emen Peshtera near Veliko Turnovo and Manole-Razkopanitsa near Plovdiv). Although stamps are found in each phase of the</page><page sequence="9">212 Douglass W. Bailey B D Figure 7 Symbols from stamp seals: a) concentric circles (Salmanovo; early or middle Chalcolithic; diameter 5.7 cm); b) cruciform (Gradeshnitsa-Malo Pole; early Neolithic); c) spiral (Azmak; early Neolithic); d) rectilinear meander (Pernik; early Neolithic; 5.2 cm x 2.6 cm) (after Makkay 1984). Neolithic and Chalcolithic, almost half of all stamps come from early Neolithic contexts, mostly from sites in the west (Gradeshnitsa-Malo Pole, Slatina, Kovatcheva, Kremenik bei Sapareva Banja, Pernik and Bulgarchevo) and the central and south-central regions (Azmashka Mogila, Chavdar, Karanovo and Kirdzhali). The most common motif is the zig-zag which appears in parallel pairs or in groups of three or more parallel lines (Fig. 6). Also represented are crosses, spirals, concentric circles and rectilinear pattern meanders (Fig. 7). There is considerable debate over the function of the stamps and the meaning of the symbols incised or modelled in relief upon their faces. While some read the symbols as religious ideograms (e.g. Todorova 1978: 84) others are more cautious, only agreeing that the symbols provide a means to access the thought of prehistoric minds (B. Nikolov 1970; 1986). In the wider context of changes in material culture (grain silos, large storage pots) and social strategies (management of land and animals resources) evident during these periods it is more profitable to interpret the stamps as mechanisms of establishing and maintaining ownership. Regardless of the interpretation proffered, it is clear that stamps were used to communicate (in the sealings) a concept. They made permanent, in symbolic form, a relationship between someone or something and a pot or sealing. By making the relationship permanent the stamps bestow a historical identity to the object so stamped. The identity is retained in visible state beyond the temporal limits of the object's production and stamping. The stamping bears the symbol in a permanent non-verbal medium. It functions to keep a record.</page><page sequence="10">Chronotypic tension in Bulgarian prehistory 213 B A B Figure 9 Early Chalcolithic incised signs from ( ) Brenitsa: a) cruciform; b) rectilinear (after B.

A B Figure 10 Early Chalcolithic incised signs from Gradeshnitsa (after B. Nikolov 1986). Like the use of clay stamps, the phenomenon of inscribing the bottoms of pots with symbols also is characteristic of both Neolithic and Chalcolithic Bulgaria. Bogdan Nikolov has recently provided a useful review of pot symbols in the Bulgarian Neolithic and Chalcolithic (B. Nikolov 1986). Nikolov notes that incised symbols on the bases of pots appear rarely in the early Neolithic (Karanovo I-II); as at Azmak in Thrace and Gradeshnitsa-Malo Pole to the west (B. Nikolov 1986: 168; 1975: fig. 15B), the cruciform is a common symbol. Excavation of late Neolithic sites, however, has produced one of the highest concentrations of pots with signs on their bases (Todorova 1978: 84; 1986; B. Nikolov 1986: 169). Many signs representing a variety of styles and combinations of different motifs are found in the north-west at Brenitsa, in the north-east at Kushlata and in the south-west at Bulgarchevo. Most common are the spiral, cross-hatched square and nondescript rectilinear symbols (Fig. 8). The largest number of signs from the Chalcolithic come from the early Chalcolithic Gradeshnitsa culture in the north-west (Brenitsa, Popitsa, Baurene and Gradeshnitsa) (B. Nikolov 1986: 172). At this time signs were also in use at sites in Thrace (Yasatepe, Azmak, Stara Zagora-mineral baths and Karanovo) and in north-eastern Bulgaria (at Balchik, Kodzhadermen, Deneva-Salmanovo, Devebargan, Ovcharovo, Golyamo Del- chevo, Vinitsa and Ruse). Crosses and rectilinear grids are very common (Fig. 9) though more complex combinations also appear (Fig. 10). Less numerous are the signs which appear in the middle Chalcolithic (at Zaminets in the north-west and at Okolglava in the west) although their infrequency results from the rarity of middle Chalcolithic settlement rather than a decrease in the inscription of pots with symbols. While some signs appear</page><page sequence="11">214 Douglass W. Bailey from late Chalcolithic contexts, the phenomenon is most evident during the late Neolithic and the early Chalcolithic. The debate over the meaning of the symbols incised on the pot bottoms resembles that surrounding the function of the ceramic stamps. Some scholars locate the signs' meanings in religious and spiritual thought (e.g. Todorovic 1969: 78), while others suggest that the signs represent an early form of writing. Using Greek archaic vases as a model, Vasic argued that the certain incised signs found on Vin6a pots represent letters of an early European writing (Vasic 1932-6). Forty years later, Georgiev drew the same conclusions about the Gradeshnitsa signs (Georgiev 1970: 7). A number of researchers have suggested that the signs signified property ownership (Winn 1981: 317; Tringham and Krstic 1990; but see Todorovic and Cermanovic 1961: 78). As Tringham has noted, the mechanism of ownership existed at several levels; she suggests that the signs from her Neolithic excavations at Selevac in Yugoslavia were used to identify single integrated households and to differentiate one household or settlement from another (Tringham and Krstic 1990: 609). While the particular function of each sign is unclear (i.e. whether they communicated pot ownership, a potter's workshop or some other pot-linked identity) all commentators agree that, like the stamps, the signs represent an early form of record keeping, a mechanism to extend the visibility and durability of a message through time, from the moment of inscription to an extended future beyond the limits of oral communication. Both the pot-base monograms and the stamps functioned to preserve and display information through time. That they were placed in permanent media ensures their survival along a linear temporal dimension. In this way the symbols recorded information across time; from pot-maker to pot-trader and user; from stamp-user to sealing-viewer. While it remains unclear which specific function the stamps and monograms served, there is no doubt that they were used to communicate information over time along a linear historical dimension. Chalcolithic treatment of the deceased Treatment of the deceased during the Chalcolithic was radically different from the patterns established during the Neolithic and Mesolithic. Where Mesolithic and Neolithic practice repositioned the dead in the sphere of the living and thus recycled the deceased, Chalcolithic practice centred on distancing the body of the deceased away from the space of the living and on identifying the persona of the deceased. The intentions of Chalcolithic burial practice were two fold. A visible identification of the deceased at the time of death was made through the inclusion of specific artefacts, possessions and symbols in the burial (usually personal ornaments). In this way the identity of the deceased was displayed (and most probably manipulated) at the time of burial. The display of these inclusions during inhumation measured (and recorded) the individual's personal, familial and community identity. Corpses of selected individuals were buried in unmarked cemeteries to the west of settlements. After the deceased had been buried in an unmarked grave the image of the deceased, and by association the family or community to which the deceased belonged, was kept alive and visible within the settlement through the display of ceramic figural representations of the individual (Fig. 11). Figurines maintained the visible presence of the</page><page sequence="12">Chronotypic tension in Bulgarian prehistory 215 deceased in the world of the living and thus maintained the social continuity of familial or community lineage beyond the limits of the biological life-cycle. While figurines had been used in the Neolithic to keep the deceased visible, Neolithic figurines are few in number (found at less than 20 per cent of sites) and are simple in decoration. All Chalcolithic settlements contain figurines and the variety of their shape is as great as their decoration is complex. In both the Neolithic and the Chalcolithic figurines were representations of deceased individuals. The use of these representations shifted from the Neolithic (when emphasis was placed on recycling the corpse and its representation in the house) to the Chalcolithic (when emphasis was placed on removing the corpse from the domestic sphere while conspicuously displaying the identity of the deceased). Burial practice and the use of anthropomorphic figurines were the primary mechanisms used to maintain social cohesion over time in Chalcolithic Bulgaria.

Bailey served to maintain and legitimate the continuity of social groups through time along the linear dimension. Long-term settlement continuity Concern for linear continuity of settlement matched Chalcolithic strategies to maintain lineage continuity beyond the limits of human biology. At this time, most habitation was in small aggregations (six to ten buildings) of houses built of clay mixed with chaff on timber frames. Each settlement marked the preferred locus for an individual Neolithic or Chalcolithic community. Through the seasonal abandonment and reoccupation of the settlements, the repair and rebuilding of the clay and timber houses, the settlements grew to substantial multi-layered tells. Some (such as Yunatsite in south-central Bulgaria) reached 9 metres in height and more than 150 metres in diameter. While building and rebuilding houses, the Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlers did not remove from the site the disused rubble of previous generations of houses. On the contrary, they stamped the broken rubble and timber into their foundations and built the new houses on top of them. The consequent growth of tell height satisfied an important need. It made the settlement a visible and identifiable component of the landscape (Sherratt 1983: 192-3). The tell marked each community's preferred settlement locus. Tells appear today, as they did 6,000 years ago, as conspicuous features in the river floodplains. Further evidence for truly monumental habitation structures appears at the end of the Chalcolithic when houses were built with stone foundations (e.g. Durankulak (Todorova 1986: 172)). The creation of a tell settlement, its development over successive seasons and generations of rebuilding, and the gradual introduction of stone building techniques establish visible markers of habitation through time along the linear dimension. The evidence of ceramic stamps, symbols incised on the bases of pots, the treatment of the dead (during the Chalcolithic), the establishment, development and implication of habitations as visible markers of settlement loci, argue forcefully that a linear chronology directed a substantial proportion of social action during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic in Bulgaria. These manifestations of the linear chronotype document the historical consciousness of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic inhabitants of south-eastern Europe. Multiple chronotypes and chronotypic tension During the Neolithic and Chalcolithic two chronotypes drive most social action. For the most part these separate chronotypes existed in different parts of the community's material and social cultures. In some cases one chronotype took over the mechanism of the other. Thus we see a shift in the significance and meaning of burial ritual from the Neolithic, when individual corpses were recycled into the foundations of houses and seldom represented in effigy, to the Chalcolithic when individuals were buried with conspicuous ornament and were kept alive in houses through the use and display of complex anthropomorphic imagery. Just as the meaning of a single action (such as burial ritual) changed over time, so also were both linear and cyclical chronotypes evident in single classes of material culture.</page><page sequence="14">Chronotypic tension in Bulgarian prehistory 217 Calendars and settlements are examples of such chronotypic multiplicity. On the one hand, calendars display information regulating seasonal and annual cycles of agricultural activity. On the other hand, by recording the cyclic information in a permanent medium the calendar participates in the linear record keeping, storing and displaying information for successive seasons, years or generations. The tell settlements are similarly multiple in chronotype. In the seasonal abandonment, reoccupation and rebuilding of tells, habi- tation is guided by a cyclic chronotype. Inhabitants leave in order to graze sheep in the upland during the summer or to avoid seasonal floods; they return to plant and harvest their crops. While the cyclical chronotype drives the abandonment and reoccupation, the linear chronotype drives the longer-term use of the multi-layered tell, conspicuous in the landscape, as a marker of the place which a particular community identifies as home. Chronotypic tension and the end of the Chalcolithic During the Chalcolithic, production of primary and secondary products increased. In turn the importance of adherence to the cyclical chronotype increased. At the same time, however, commitment to a linear, historical perspective intensified as major effort and wealth (gold, copper, shell and bone jewelry in burials) was invested in maintaining social continuity beyond the limits imposed by biology. More important developments affected trading and exchange networks. While trade and alliance networks existed throughout the Neolithic and Chalcolithic (e.g. related to flint, obsidian, Spondylus gaederopus, and probably copper and gold) traffic in trade increased towards the end of the Chalcolithic and dominated the early Bronze Age (especially with respect to the movement of metal ores and bronze tools and ornament). Sherrat characterizes the increase in trade as a shift in perspective, from one of inward-looking and general self sufficiency (characterized by the Neolithic and Chalco- lithic) to one of outward-looking, dependent on new developments to the north, south and west (for the Bronze Age). Those communities (such as the spectacular cemetery at Varna) which were oriented to external contacts were the ones which flourished (Sherratt 1983: 193-5). Inter-regional contacts and alliances gained importance during this period of increased trade. While Bulgaria had been the centre of south-eastern Europe during the Chalcolithic, the region became a crossroads on the periphery of the new systems. A distinctive system of symbols, which could be maintained without respect to limitations of time or space, developed in response to increasing inter-regional contacts. Symbols of power, authority and prestige are evident in the late Chalcolithic (e.g. at the Varna necropolis, axes, chisels). Such symbolic systems define the linear chronotype: time and space are overcome by universal durable symbols of record keeping and stamps (during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic) and by corpuses of selected prestige goods (during the early Bronze Age). Durable records of alliances established one year (or season) removed the need to re-establish the alliance each year or season. Early Bronze Age life was substantially different from that of the Chalcolithic. The appearance of large numbers of rich burials, as at Varna, Devniya and Durankulak, decreased. Burial ritual itself changed from settlement-associated cemeteries of individ- uals (e.g. Ovcharovo, Vinitsa, Golyamo Delchevo) to isolated small groups of mounds</page><page sequence="15">218 Douglass W. Bailey covering single, usually male, bodies (e.g. at Turnava and Knezha near Vratsa, Lovech, Bereket and Obruchiste near Star Zagora, Belogradets near Varna and Plachidol near Dobrich). Much of the symbolic material culture changed; anthropomorphs and tectomorphs are replaced by a more constricted usage of symbolic goods (e.g. axes). Some have sought to explain these changes in terms of invasion, migration and population change (e.g. Gimbutas 1977; 1979). Sherratt's idea of a shift in perspective, from inward-looking and centred to outward-looking and exchange-based, is a truer representation of the social changes documented in the archaeological record (Sherratt 1983: 195). The increase in trading contacts and the wider horizons of interactions and alliances necessary for bronze production combined to reinforce the outward perspective of Bulgarians during the third millennium. The shift in perspective matches an increased dependence on a linear chronotype. Indeed the linear chronotype facilitates and aids the maintenance of alliances and long-range trade networks. The shift in chronotype which marks the changes evident in the archaeological record in the middle of the fourth millennium BC was not sudden, nor was it complete. It is clear that the linear chronotype was one of two major strategies driving social action since the beginning of the Neolithic. The break at 3500 BC therefore is a development of a system documented for more than three millennia. The decline of the importance of the cyclical chronotype around 3500 BC is contemporaneous with the colder climate accompanying the Piora oscillation which produced a landscape more suited to ovicaprid pastoralism and less to agricultural production (Barker 1985: 106). As the predominance of the linear chronotype was not a sudden break, the cyclical chronotype did still exist after the end of the Chalcolithic for the production of agricultural resources and the intensification of sheep pastoralism noted by Dennell and Webley (Dennell and Webley 1975; Dennell 1978). Sherratt's identification of a major increase in the production of secondary products (and the inherent cyclical structure of animal management for secondary products) during the early Bronze Age also implies that the cyclical chronotype still had a significant place in Bulgarian life after the end of the Chalcolithic. Indeed during the early Bronze Age some inhumation burials returned to the domestic locus, although the houses are now more permanent, built on stone foundations and not open to cyclical regeneration. It is most accurate to speak, not of the predominance of one chronotype over another at 3500 BC, but of a shift in the relative importance of the linear and cyclical chronotypes. Conclusions Neolithic and Chalcolithic societies were driven by two chronotypes, one cyclical the other linear. In some instances these chronotypes stood in opposition to each other (e.g. agricultural and animal breeding cycles of reproduction versus linear record keeping) while in others they combined in a single part of the archaeological record (e.g. tell settlements) to drive strategies of both chronotypes at the same time. Some classes of artefact document both chronotypes at different levels: the calendar grids and altar calendars tracked cycles of days, months and seasons in a cyclical manner at the same time</page><page sequence="16">Chronotypic tension in Bulgarian prehistory 219 as they recorded the tracking information along the linear dimension for the benefit of future generations. Prehistoric chronotypes are clearly evident in the archaeological record of the Bulgarian Neolithic and Chalcolithic. The variety and interaction of the chronotypes recovered from this record are proof that chronotypes are plural and manifold. It is no longer acceptable, nor is it accurate, to label prehistoric European society as possessors of single perspectives of time. Clearly reconstructions of prehistoric social organization and social behaviour must address prehistoric perspectives of time which were multiple, interacting and conflicting. 9.ii.93 Centerfor Slavic and East European Studies University of California, Berkeley References Bahn, P. 1977.

Abstract Bailey, Douglass Chronotypic tension in Bulgarian prehistory: 6500-3500 BC Chronotypes are the models through which time takes on practical or conceptual significance. This paper explores the tensions between two different chronotypes in the prehistoric archaeology of Bulgaria, one essentially linear and the other cyclical. Their development is traced in relation to the pattern of settlement, the subsistence economy, social organization, the treatment of the dead and development of calenders and record keeping.</page></plain_text>
