<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RELATIONS BETWEEN RELIGION AND MORALITY AMONG THE EARLY GREEKS AND ROMANS MARTIN R. P. McGUIRE, Ph.D. Instructor in Latin and Greek, Catholic University of America, D. C. THE Greek and Roman religions, until a relatively late stage in their developments, were entirely distinct from each other. It is only from the 6th century B. C. that Greek religion began to influence the religious beliefs of Rome. Accordingly, in the pres- ent sketch of the relations between religion and morality among the early Greeks and Romans, each people will be treated sepa- rately. THE GREEKS Our whole approach to the study of Greek religion must be, obviously, the historical one. The first question then is: What sources are at our disposal? Our sources are literary and archeo- logical remains, fortunately very copious so far as ancient sources go, but not equally abundant for all periods of Greek religion, nor for all centers of Greek civilization in the ancient world.</page><page sequence="2">12 PRIMITIVE MAN The extant Greek literature from Homer to Justinian is pre- meated with religious thought and myth. Among these literary sources, let it suffice to mention Homer, Hesiod, the Lyric Poets, the Dramatists, the historian Herodotus,-who in many ways an- ticipates the modern anthropologist, with his data on the customs and religious practices of the Greeks and foreign peoples,-the philosophers, particularly Plato, and the Attic orators; then later, the grammarians, scholiasts, lexicographers, geographical writers like Strabo and especially Pausanias, the moralist Plutarch, and lastly, the Christian Fathers with their polemical writings against paganism. This literary material, however, forms but a fraction of what once existed. There are serious gaps in our knowledge continually confronting us. As will be noted a little later, we have no literary evidence for Greek religion before Homer save what is actually contained in the Homeric poems. Again, we often meet allusions in some of our latest ancient sources to religious institu- tions or practices which we know must go back to very early times, but which do not happen to be mentioned in our earlier extant sources. Secondly, we have a great wealth of archeological remains and works of art of a religious character. These become really help- ful, however, only from the 8th century B. C. on, when we are assisted in our interpretation of them by a steadily increasing number of non-literary texts, namely, the inscriptions. A large number of the latter are concerned directly or indirectly with re- ligion. It should never be forgotten, as regards archeological remains in general, that unless they are supplemented by texts, literary or non-literary, they are by no means satisfactory sources of information. In an estimate of Greek religion from whatever angle, the in- vestigator is confronted by several other problems, in addition to that of sources, which make the study of Greek religious institu- tions almost unique in its difficulty. When we speak of Greek religion we ordinarily think of it in terms of the Homeric Poems or of its manifestations in Periclean Athens. Thanks to copious literary sources, inscriptions, and monumental remains, we best know Greek religion as practiced at Athens. But in a scientific approach to Greek religion we cannot confine ourselves so nar- rowly. In the scientific sense Greek religion must be understood</page><page sequence="3">PRIMITIVE MAN 13 to designate all the religious beliefs and practices of the Greek race throughout its hundreds of communities in the ancient Mediterran- ean world, i.e. in Greece proper, in the islands of the Aegean Sea, on the coasts of Asia Minor, in Southern Italy and Sicily, in Egypt and Cyrene, and elsewhere from the Black Sea to Gaul and Spain. In these multiple foundations, there existed, down to the time of Alexander at least, the most varied stages of political, social, and religious development. While many of the major Greek cults had numerous points in common wherever they flourished, yet they varied infinitely in detail and importance from city to city and from region to region. Furthermore, many of the Greek cults, even the major cults, were sometimes modified almost beyond rec- ognittion, under the influence of earlier religious beliefs and prac- tices in force at the coming of the Greeks. One need only recall in this connection the worship of Artemis at Ephesus. Again, it should not be forgotten that there was nothing like a general con- formity in doctrine, a system of orthodoxy, in the religion of the Greeks. Hence there was no central body of dogmas, so to speak, holding their religious beliefs in cohesion. The Greek priests, moreover,' never formed a strong caste with great political and social authority and influence, and consequently were never con- servers of orthodoxy in the sense of the Oriental priesthoods. The nearest approach to a system of doctrine which we find among the Greeks is in the several mystery religions with ther fixed rites and beliefs, but the mystery religions appear at a relatively late stage in Greek religious devel6pment. The study of Greek religion as a whole is complicated, also, as we have already said, by the fact that all parts of the Greek world did not progress with equal rapidity toward a higher form of civil- ization. We find, for example, an advanced religious develop- ment in the highly civilized city state of fifth-century Athens, while at this same period in the isolated region of Arcadia, primitive tribal, political, social, and religious conditions still prevailed. Human sacrifice was not abandoned in Arcadia, we know, before the 2nd century, A.D. Let this example suffice to show that to secure a true picture of the practices and influence of Greek religion we must study the latter in intimate connection with the general political and social history of the Greek world. Thanks to our sources, we see the relations between religious and political</page><page sequence="4">14 PRIMITIVE MAN and social development best at Athens. Religion modified pro- foundly the political and social institutions of the Athenian polis, and in turn was modified itself in the subsequent political, social, and intellectual growth of the Athenian state. Lastly, as indicated at least implicitly above, the long period of the existence of Greek religion entails problems in itself. Greek religion covers a period of about two thousand years, from c. 1500 B. C. to 5oo A. D. On account of the nature of our sources it is not always easy or even possible to evaluate many phases of Greek religion at certain times and places in this long development. It is particularly difficult to ascertain in many instances to what extent Greek religion was really a vital force in regulating moral conduct, because we frequently know so little about the ordinary daily life of Greek society. With these general ideas on the problems which Greek religion presents to the investigator clearly in our minds, we are in a better position to take up the question of immediate concern to us: the relations between religion and morality among the early Greeks. Interpreting the term " early " as broadly as we can, we shall treat of Greek religion in the first thousand years of its existence, i.e. from about 1500 to about 500 B. C. When the peoples whom we call the Greeks moved southward into central and southern Greece, and eastward across the islands of the Aegean Sea, in the course of the third and second millenia B. C., they found a higher civilization possessing, apparently, well developed political and social institutions, already long settled in these regions. This earlier civilization, which we call the Minoan- Mycenaean, unquestionably influenced the Greeks in many ways. But our evidence does not enable us to ascertain precisely what was the original religion of the Greek invaders, or just what ele- ments they borrowed from the peoples they found in Greece on their coming. These peoples would seem to have been already influenced to some degree by their contacts with the Semites and Egyptians, a circumstance that complicates the problem further. Our knowledge of Minoan-Mycenaean religion, as well as of Minoan-Mycenaean political and social institutions in general, is still extremely unsatisfactory. We have numerous archeological, remains, but so far we have not succeeded in deciphering the Minoan scripts, and as noted previously, stones without texts to</page><page sequence="5">PRIMITIVE MAN 15 aid in their interpretation are largely silent as to the precise nature of a people's institutions. What little we know of the Minoan- Mycenaean and pre-Homeric Greek religion, we have, therefore, to piece together chiefly from archeological remains, and from the survivals wh ch we can detect in Homer, and later in the various cults of historical Greece. On the basis of our meager evidence for this very early period, the period naturally of the greatest in- terest to anthropologists, it is simply impossible to enter into the question of the relations between religion and morality among the Greeks at this stage of their development. Our earliest literary sources for Greek religion are the Homeric Poems, composed in Asia Minor between 90o-8o00 B. C. Homer's religion is not primitive but is a fully developed anthropomorphic polytheism. The Homeric gods are glorified men enjoying greater than human power and possessing immortality. On the other hand, they need food and sleep and are subject to human passions. Zeus, the King of the gods, is sometimes spoken of as being abso- lutely supreme and again as being subject like all others to a vague power called Fate. Throughout the Homeric Poems, the gods are looked upon as the sources of all blessings and, at the same time, the hostility or anger of the gods is considered the cause of all misfortunes. In times of suffering or disaster, the Homeric warrior immediately tries to discover what deity he has offended. The Homeric gods, while sometimes more immoral in their actions than men them- selves, are, all in all, on the side of justice and mercy. At the beginning of the Odyssey there is a famous passage in which Zeus expresses his righteous attitude thus: " Look you now, how ready mortals are to blame the gods. It is from us, they say, that evils come, but they even of themselves, through their own blind folly, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained ".1 The Homeric gods, particularly Zeus, protect the weak and des- titute. The cult of Zeus as protector of the family and of strang- ers is already in evidence. The vengeance of the gods is solemnly invoked against those who injure suppliants, guests, or even beg- gars. The sanctity of oaths is proclaimed in the name of the dread divinities of the Lower World. The gods punish men es- 1 Odyssey I, 32-34</page><page sequence="6">16 PRIMITIVE MAN pecially for their pride and insolence. Mindful of this, Achilles says very humbly at the death of Hector: " "Lie thou dead; my fate will I accept when so Zeus willest to bring it to pass and the other immortal gods ".2 Sinfulness in Homer is ordinarily associated indeed with acts of human insolence, i.e. man's failure to recognize his own absolute dependence on the gods, and his neglect to offer them proper sacrifice. Homeric sin is related to our concept of sin chiefly in these points: breaking an oath, disrespect to one's father and mother, and ill treatment of the stranger, i.e. one's fellow man. Men are obliged to sacrifice to the gods and by so doing are thought to enter into friendly communion with them. The gods in return for sacrifices are expected to grant favors and protection to their worshippers. Thus the priest Chryses says in his prayer to Apollo: " Hear me, thou of the silver bow, . .. if ever I roofed over a shrine to thy pleasing, or if ever I burned to thee fat thigh- pieces of bulls or goats, fulfill thou for me this prayer." 3 Such a form of worship may give the impression of a contract, but the evidence of the Homeric Poems as a whole would certainly seem to indicate that men do not feel that they can do more than per- suade or win the good will of the divinities by prayers and sacri- fices. There is no; mention of magic in this connection in Homer. Beyond a possible reference to the punishment of the perjured after death by the Erinyes, perhaps the personifications of the power of the curse that followed perjury, we hear of no retribu- tion for ordinary mortals in the next life. On the other hand, Homer holds out little joy to the good in the world to come. A few favored mortals, like Menelaus, go to dwell in the happy Elysian Plain at the end of the world, but the vast majority of mankind must wander as shadowy, almost unreal, forms of their living selves in the gloomy and joyless halls of Hades, king of the Lower World. When Odysseus on his visit to Hades, meets the shade of Achilles and tries to console him in his lot, the latter reflects the Homeric attitude to the life after death in his well known answer: " Nay, seek not to speak soothingly to me of death, glorious Odysseus. I should choose, so I might live on earth, to 2 Iliad 22, 365-366.

The cardinal virtues are bravery, wisdom, love of home, and family, and regard for hospitality." 5 The poet Hesiod, who lived about 700 B. C., our next great literary authority after Homer, puts his main emphasis on justice as the basis of social relations. Justice was the vital need of an age when the peasants of Central Greece were suffering a ruthless social and economic oppression at the hands of a hostile landed nobility. To his fundamental virtue of justice Hesiod assigns a supernatural origin: " Perses, put these words now in thy heart and harken to justice, but forget violence utterly. For this the son of Cronus has established as a rule for men. Fishes and wild beasts, and winged birds he ordained should devour one another, since there is no justice among them; but to man he has given jus- tice which is far the best ".6 In accordance with justice, men must be kind to strangers, suppliants, and orphans, respect their parents, be hospitable to their friends, and refrain from adultery. From justice, the daughter of Zeus, there is no. escape for those who act unjustly. Sooner or later the unjust receive divine punishment. It should be observed that the motives underlying Hesiodic jus- tice are utilitarian, not altruistic. Men sacrifice to the gods and act justly merely to gain material prosperity. Regarding the life after death Hesiod does not advance beyond Homer. In the period from Hesiod to the Persian Wars, we see the relations between religion and morality most clearly revealed in the Greek city states or poleis which constitute the normal form of political and social life in the more progressive sections of the Greek world from the seventh century to the death of Alexander. The Greek polis was based essentially on the extension of the 4 Odyssey II, 488-493 5 Clifford H. Moore, The Religious Thought of the Greeks, Cambridge, Mass., 1916, 20 6 Works and Days 274-279</page><page sequence="8">18 PRIMITIVE MAN idea of the family and the clan to a larger group. The polis, con- sequently, was profoundly influenced from the first by religion. The divinities that presided over the family hearth and guided the relations of the members of the family with one another, and with their neighbors, now came to perform the same functions for the state. In such an identity of the religion of the family with that of the state religious duties became merged with civic duties, a fact which sometimes obscures to; the eyes of the modern investi- gator the religious motivation of almost all the activities of the Greek city states in the days of their greatness, and which goes far to explain their clannish exclusiveness in their relations with one another. Through the transformation of the family religion into a state religion, duties like marrying healthily and early, begetting chil- dren, cherishing and honoring one's parents, and protecting the orphan, thus came to be civic duties, but civic duties inspired and sanctioned by religion as well as, by custom and law. Under such circumstances, as Farnell well puts it, "the state being the family writ large, private and public morality could not clash ".7 Down to the time of the Persian Wars, then, the majority of the Greeks regarded the gods and their concern in the affairs of men much in the way which we have noted in Homer and Hesiod, except that we observe a steadily growing conviction of the idea of divine justice. As regards the future life,--outside of the mystery religions-, we hear little beyond that we have seen in Homer and Hesiod. The mystery religions appear in Greece in the seventh and sixth centuries, B. C., and play a very important part in the subsequent history of Greek religion. But we cannot go into their history and problems here.8 We are primarily concerned with two points only: To what extent, if any, did they promote morality, and on what conditions did they hold out a promise of a future life ? Orphism seems originally to have had no connection whatever with morality but it gradually acquired ethical principles akin to 7L. R. Farnell, art.

Cornford, Mystery Religions and Pre-Socratic Philosophy, in Cambridge Ancient History, vol. iv, New York, 1926, 522-38</page><page sequence="9">PRIMITIVE MAN I9 those which we find in Homeric religion and in the religion of the city state. According to the Orphic teaching the soul is imprisoned in the body through sin and must strive to become free from its prison house. This is accomplished by purification rites, by pecu- liar forms of abstinence, and by further rites, in part magical, whereupon the soul enters into union with the divinity in this life and is promised happiness in the next. After death the soul goes to Hades. Its existence in Hades is one of bliss or punishment according to its life on earth. The good soul enjoys the pleasures of an earthly paradise, while the evil soul suffers terrible tortures in the pits of Tartarus or Hell. After a thousand years, the soul, good or bad, is born again into earthly existence. The evil soul especially is not always reborn into human form, but into various lower animals. The good soul, after a number of such sojourns in Hades and rebirths on earth, would seem ultimately to have been rewarded with an endless life of bliss free from further incarnations. The evil soul is thought to suffer the punishments of Hell after death and to be subject to reincarnation indefinitely. The Eleusinian Mysteries, on the whole, seem to have exerted a good moral influence. Greek writers of the fifth century B. C. tell us that those who had been initiated in these mysteries were inclined to take a more serious view of life and to show a sterner attitude on questions of justice. A vivid hope of future happi- ness was held out to the initiated, but as to the nature of this future happiness beyond the continued existence of the soul, we are not informed. From the evidence at our disposal for the Orphic and Eleusinian Mysteries it is reasonable to believe that salvation depended almost entirely on fulfilling the requirements of a number of rites mostly non-moral in character. It is quite clear also that salvation was held out exclusively to the initiated. THE ROMANS Our approach here must likewise be historical, and hence our first concern is the sources. Our only early sources are archeo- logical remains. They tell us little until the third century B. C. and after, when the inscriptions aid us in interpretation. In the inscriptions, the calendars with their indications of festivals, among other data, are particularly important. We receive no help in the</page><page sequence="10">20 PRIMITIVE MAN study of early Roman religion from mythology. The Romans never had a mythology of their own. The literary sources for Roman religion are all late, very few antedating the first century B. C. The Roman authorities on religious matters-men like Varro (our chief authority), Vergil and Ovid,-write under the influence of Greek learning. They would lead us to believe,rfor example, that the early Roman religion was anthropomorphic, when in reality it was not. These writers, therefore, are invalu- able to us not so much for their own opinions and interpretations, as for the accurate descriptions which they furnish of ritual, cults, and festivals, which frequently bear unmistakable traces of the earlier religious situation. We ordinarily employ the term early Roman religion to desig- nate the period of Roman religious development from the eighth century or earlier to about the end of the sixth century, B. C. As far back as our sources of whatever kind permit us to go, we find the Roman religion a composite one. What elements were original with the Italic peoples when they pushed southward into the Italian peninsula in the course of the third and second millenia B. C., and what elements they borrowed from the earlier inhabitants, we can- not say definitely. The Etruscan influence on Roman religion dates only from the eighth or seventh century B. C., and was actually far less than was once supposed. The Etruscans may have given an impulse to anthropomorphic religion among the Romans and they certainly gave the latter their elaborate system of divination, although divination seems to have been practiced to some extent by the Romans themselves from earliest times. The oldest form of Roman religion that we know is Animism. The early Romans worshipped " spirits ", in their own language, numina, i.e., " beings with will-power ". These spirits were asso- ciated with all manner of visible objects, states, and actions, that came within the sphere of the life of an agricultural people. They are particularly associated, so far as we can judge, with function. The early Romans gave their numina no personal shape, nor did they conceive of them dwelling in temples. They were looked upon rather as the indwelling spirits of the objects or actions with which they were associated. The numina were regarded as hos- tile, or perhaps better, as neutral powers. The Roman attitude toward them is expressed by the word religio, certainly used pri-</page><page sequence="11">PRIMITIVE MAN 21 marily in the sense of a " feeling of fear ", " awe ", or " anxiety . The Romans believed that they could practically control the good will and cooperation of the nuntina by certain set prayers and sacrifices, scrupulously performed. The regulating of the relations between men and the numina passed in the course of time, from the hands of the pater familias, -except in some purely domestic matters,-into the control of the state. The individual Roman came to rely on the state to establish the proper relations between its members and its divini- ties. Under state control, there developed, accordingly, an elabo- rate ius divinum-the source of the later ius civile-which dealt completely with all questions concerning the relations between gods and men. By the fulfillment of all the necessary prayers and sacrifices in the most punctilious ritualistic fashion the pax deorum, i.e., the harmonious agreement between men and the numina, was invariably secured. So far as we can observe, the early Romans had no belief what- ever in a system of rewards and punishments after death. The dead were apparently thought of vaguely as hostile spirits that had to be driven away by certain rites and formulae. Offerings were made to the dead, but the dead were neither invoked nor worshipped. The early Roman religion certainly promoted the sanctity of family life by investing, not merely the great events, but even the ordinary daily affairs of that life with a religious sanction. In the hands of the state it unquestionably promoted a sense of public duty, but at the same time it tended inevitably to become stultified and unreal, and thus to contribute in itself to the marked decay in genuine religious feeling among the Romans which we note from the third century B. C. The moral influence of the early Roman religion-outside the family circle-was not really direct, but largely resulted from the discipline and the sense of duty which it imposed. In the words of Warde Fowler, who has dealt with the problems of the early religious beliefs and practices of the Romans more satisfactorily than most modern scholars, " the one feature of this religion which had a moral value was the constant and indispensable attention to the details of duty; if these were not duties to a deity who is righteous and the source of all righteousness, yet they were duties</page><page sequence="12">22 PRIMITIVE MAN that must be fulfilled; and they constituted a righteous feeling to- wards the divine beings, which created a claim upon them to deal righteously towards the Roman, and to hinder and destroy his enemies, human and material. Beyond this we cannot go, the pietas of the old Roman was a valuable quality in itself but it never led him to base his daily conduct upon higher motives than obedi- ence to the state and to its authorities as mediators between himself and a dangerous spiritual world." 9 9 W.
