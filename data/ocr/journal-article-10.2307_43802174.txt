<plain_text><page sequence="1">"MÁS LEJOS, NEGREABAN LOS PAVOS": IMPLICATIONS OF AN ASPECT OF GABRIEL MIRÓ' S ANIMAL IMAGERY Kevin S. Larsen SUUUUULkSLSUUULSUUUUUUL&amp;SUULSlSUUUUULSUUL&amp;JUL&amp;JLàJUtJt. Students of the fiction of Gabriel Miró often comment on the impor- tance of animal imagery in his novels and stories. The beasts of the field and the fowls of the air animate his fiction, adding dimension and dis- tinction to his prose. Both domestic and wild creatures figure in Miró 's works as counterparts and as counterpoint to the human participants (Ramos 228-50; Larsen, "Mironian Fauna" 415-28; Altisent 215-30). This generally involves the humanization of the animals; as Margarita de Mayo has written, the Alicantine writer is "dotado de una tècnica maravillosa para la transposición de las actitudes humanas a los ani- males, que él observa con pulcritud de miniaturista" (202). However, such anthropomorphism is complemented (and complicated) by the fre- quent animalization of some of the men and women depicted in his liter- ary corpus , individuals who by their deeds or attitudes show themselves to be less than human. There is in Miró 's works an identifiable aesthetic symbiosis in which human beings and other animals play significant parts in each others' stories. Miró 's fiction stands as an ecosystem in which no single life form exists in a vacuum and where all are mutually dependant metaphorically for the meaning that informs their mutual ex- istence. A case in point involves the barnyard fowl represented in several novels. This present essay will focus particularly on one salient aspect of these several scenarios, the turkeys, and what Miró 's descriptions of them reveal concerning his understanding of human, as well as of poul- try behavior. Long before the research of the middle and late twentieth century into animal violence (again extrapolating with regard to its sig-</page><page sequence="2">46 ROMANCE NOTES nificance for the human counterpart), Miró would focus on what has generally come to be called the "pecking order" (Lorenz 40-44 et pas- sim). In Del vivir (1904), he describes the introduction of a new rooster into the corral. It is clear that the turkeys, which Miró humanizes with- out diminishing their essential avian nature and presence, instigate and, more importantly, prolong the trouble about to break out. Behind the scenes with respect to the dominant rooster and his harem, yet always in the aesthetic foreground, "negreaban los pavos." Elaborating on the significance of the blackness of their plumage and, by extention, of their demeanor, Miró observes that, as the other fowls approach the "intruder," "dos desgarbados pavos, hundidas las cabezas en la negra sotana de sus plumas, llegaban cojeando y empujándose." The priestly aura of the image is enhanced as the focus is turned to the "cuellos" of the two turkeys. This word can mean "neck," but in the pre- sent context it would certainly imply the "collar" that, along with the cassock, is an emblem of the curate. As Miró drops these broadly specif- ic hints of humanity, he is nonetheless able to preserve the fowls' pres- ence as turkeys. That is, they are birds, despite the metaphorical impli- cations of their behavior. In typically colorful yet specific language, Miró develops his characterization, illustrating his close observation of the creatures' threatening or aggressive behavior: Los pavos se hinchaban, se erizaban. Dejaron caer las rodelas de sus alas; desplegaron la cola. Las carnosidades de sus cuellos reventaban de sangre; sus fieros ojos tenían cer- cos azules. Aquellas cabezas repulsivas tornábanse amarillas, blancas, bermejas, lívidas, verdosas, cual si un cristal prismático les fuera prestando el iris. ¡Oh! Estaban amenazadores, imponentes, como locomotoras de plumas. Y pasaban y repasaban estruendosos cerca de los adversarios, vomitando las balandronadas de su canto semejante a un ladrido. (Obras completas 47) Miró may humanize these turkeys in certain aspects, though without stripping away their feathers. There is a ferocious fight between the rival roosters. The newcomer is routed and the victor quickly forgets, "generosamente" Miró suggests, his defeated adversary. But the turkeys forget nothing and forgive even less: "los ruines lo echaron de su refugio, lo persiguieron azotándole con sus firmes alas. Tenían en su saña gesto aborrecible." Even the female</page><page sequence="3">"MÁS LEJOS, NEGREABAN LOS PAVOS" 47 turkeys enter the fray: "una pava blanca, alta, enjuta, remilgada, que recordaba la figura de una aya inglesa [a beata in feathers!], lo denunció con frialdad aterradora. Y otra vez los pavos le acometieron con sus picos costrosos de salvado." Finally, things ostensibly calm down, though always the turkeys stand vigilant: "a la entrada del sombrajo se apostaron . . . inmóviles, inexorables, siniestros como enlutados hom- bres y como hombres tenaces en su aborrecer, hasta sacrificar su des- canso por dañar a sus hermanos" ( Obras completas 48; cf. López Bustos 151-53). Ian R. Macdonald has termed this sequence a "fable" which "draws together the portrait of [human] society" that is presented earlier in Del vivir. Macdonald notes the "sinister" behavior of the turkeys, comment- ing how "priest-like," they stand "as ironic guardians at the gates of Par- adise," a paradise which they deny themselves to persecute others more efficiently. For this critic, the animal society is "a human copy" and "men are not only shown ... to be part of their universe, but ... to be- have like animals" (196; cf. Marquez Villanueva 103). Or it may be, rather, that the human society is a replica of the animal, that the "peck- ing order" established in the barnyard is reflected "upward" along the food chain that the Great Chain of Being has become. At any rate, the imagery of the turkey-priests is significant for understanding how Miró views both categories. His apparently negative feelings concerning the clergymen color his representation of the birds, while his equally unflat- tering perspective on turkeys reflects onto his human characterizations. Miró would pursue this telling barnyard imagery in Nuestro Padre San Daniel (1921), the first of the Oleza novels. Here he describes the feeding of various sorts of fowl: along with the aggressive eating pat- terns of other birds, "los codazos de los alones de las pavas no permitían que los palomos comieran" ( Obras completas 861). It is not so much a question of denying oneself in order to prevent others from obtaining something. Here the turkeys are not human; they merely act out the Dar- winian (or Spencerian) routine of self-service and survival of the fittest. Yet under this order of things, the avian society, where all are arrayed against all, recalls aspects of its human counterpart in Oleza. The vi- cious Padre Bellod, as tenacious in his hatred, and doña Elvira Gandía, as dried-up, as prim and proper as the turkeys described above, stand as domineering, grasping sentinels at the gates of "paradise."</page><page sequence="4">48 ROMANCE NOTES In "Agustina y Tabalet," a section of Años y leguas (1928), once more turkeys figure prominently on the field of avian strife; they are no more sympathetic than their counterparts in earlier novels. First the females are depicted: "cargadas de espaldas, largas, lisas, las pavas, con su media cabeza flaccida y cadavérica, acuden y se vuelven pisándose las uñas. Aunque estén bien cebadas de moyuelo, parecen flacas; demacración de malmaridadas." Then there is the male: "Demasiado pavo; demasiado él; tanto, que se basta en sí mismo. Allí está solo, pati- nando con crepitación de rueda y de alas de rodelas negras. Gira y tre- pida grifado, estallándose sus collares de verrugas ensangrentadas y azules, siempre de soslayo para saber si los demás le creen" {Obras completas 1172). The creatures are very much turkeys. The male offers a particularly apt image of strutting yet perpetually insecure dominance. However, in context, their demeanor also recalls certain human partic- ipants in Miró 's works: Padre Bellod and Elvira, among others, immedi- ately come to mind. The reference to the "collares," particularly in light of the other imagery of the turkey, again suggests a possible clerical co- efficient. Finally, there is a key passage in Libro de Sigüenza (1917), where the protagonist speaks to a "capellán de monjas" (whose posturing and relationship to a group of females recalls the male turkeys above). The two men contemplate an ostensibly tranquil barnyard scene, from which the priest, "con mucha complacencia," extrapolates concerning human behavior. Referring to Fray Luis de Granada, he states that "la Creación ... es un libro inmenso y glorioso cuyo lector es el hombre." His rhap- sody is rudely interrupted by "un furioso estruendo entre el averío." All are battling over "un gusanico muerto, caído de una sera de estiércol." Although it is not just the turkeys that fight here, they are a principal force in the combat: "huían las pavas, pisándose el faldellín de sus alas, y en sus ojos, en su cabeza y hasta en sus flaccidos cuellos se hacían li- vores de iracundia." As Sigüenza observes - the humanization of his material is again readily apparent - "apenas descubierto el manjar ... lo codiciaron todos. Y se odiaron." Then the caballero levantino begins to philosophize on his own: He aquí otra página del sabio libro de la Naturaleza. La paz y el amor de estas aladas criaturas han sido destruidos por un gusano muerto. Nosotros, los pobres hombres, somos capaces de las más grandes ternuras y virtudes, somos capaces de . . . querernos mucho hasta que nos inquieta y nos concita . . . una gusanera.</page><page sequence="5">"MÁS LEJOS, NEGREABAN LOS PAVOS" 49 The capellán reprimands Sigüenza for such "filosofías y blasfemias," both of which, depending on one's persuasion, also animate the other de- scriptions of poultry yards. These birds are birds, but they also serve as a vehicle to a larger understanding, concerning human (if not humane) as well as avian behavior {Obras completas 634-35). With the explorations of the New World and its eventual introduc- tion into Europe, there developed about the turkey a certain aura of ex- oticism and ostentation. Rabelais and Shakespeare, among others, would mention the fowl in this regard (Honour 37-38). 1 But because of its rel- atively late arrival on the European scene, there is, especially when com- pared to birds such as the eagle, the dove, the swan, and the vulture, lit- tle folklore or popular symbolism associated with the turkey there (cf. White; Rowland; Clark and McMunn, who make no mention of the turkey at all). Still, Miró 's comparison of the turkeys to priests is partic- ularly appropriate, historically as well as psychologically, since priests, especially the Jesuits, have from the beginning been associated in Eu- rope with the introduction and cultivation of this domestic species. It was, as Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin explains in his famous Physiologie du Goût (1826), the Jesuits who first introduced turkeys into the Old World. As a result of this continued close and metaphorical- ly-rich association, "dans la langage familier, on disait autrefois et on dit encore un jésuite , pour désigner un dindon" (84). So Miró has reestab- lished a traditional connection, humanizing the fowl and enlarging upon the aura of potential association about them and their human counter- parts. In Nuestro Padre San Daniel , don Magín states that "vanidad y odio" are "las dos maldades específicas que más nos diferencian de las bestias" {Obras completas 839). He may or may not be correct, though it seems apparent from his characterization of the turkeys that Miró does not agree. The author humanizes the behavior of the birds, couching his descriptions in unabashedly anthropomorphic language. Yet he also is far more Darwinian than don Magín (who prides himself on the liberal- ism and breadth of his outlook). Miró clearly rejects such trumped-up differences - among many others, including bipedalism, language-use, 1 There is, however, much New World folklore and a fair amount of literature in which turkeys figure prominently. See, for instance: Sax 77; Osborn 145-47, 154; Allen 61.</page><page sequence="6">50 ROMANCE NOTES tool-making, etc. - that at one time or another have been used to sepa- rate men from other animals. Miró 's representations of clerical turkeys, particularly if these priests happen to be Jesuits, seem to indicate additional dimensions of his nega- tive feelings about that order with which at times he had so much to do. This revelation is almost infinitely subtle, in line with Miró 's personal artistic creed, "decir las cosas por insinuación" ("Autobiografía" x). One may recall in this context the descriptions of clerics and their excesses by contemporary writers such as Baroja in El mayorazgo de Labraz (1903) and El cura de Monleón (1936), Blasco Ibáñez in La catedral (1904) and El intruso (1904), and Ramón Pérez de Ayala in A.M.D.G. (1910). These works, all dealing with Roman Catholic priests, and most with Jesuits, in an unfavorable light, while they may be good literature, are hammer blows compared to Miró 's artful, insinuating, and profound- ly effective (and affective) portraits. Quietly and efficiently he achieves his artistic and moral ends. It is not that Miró is virulently anticlerical or implacably anti-Jesuit. Some of his most sympathetic characters are religious, for instance, don Magín of Nuestro Padre San Daniel and El obispo leproso (1926). Some of his least sympathetic characters, however, are clerical. Padre Bellod, also of the Oleza novels, comes to mind here. Miró had been a student at the Jesuit colegio of Santo Domingo in Orihuela as a youth. Edmund L. King affirms that in later years "nunca recordó con gusto sus días es- colares" (44-45; cf. Ruiz-Funes 51). In his introduction to El obispo le- proso, Manuel Ruiz-Funes analyzes various overt references, in that novel and in several others, Miró makes to the Jesuits and their system of education. Always the statements are subtle and even subdued: "nunca aparece el alegato, ni la pintura expresionista perceptible en otros escritores; ni la sátira, ni el sarcasmo. Ninguno de esos proced- imientos son habituales en Miró. A él ... le bastaba 'decir las cosas por insinuación' " (57). In turn, Paciencia Ontañón de Lope has written that Miró is able to condemn clerical abuses and inadequacies other writers have con- demned, "pero haciéndolo siempre desde un punto de vista objetivo, donde no todo tiene que ser necesariamente malo ni reprobable" (56). By the very directness of its indirection, the imagery of the turkeys is perhaps the most insinuatingly effective of all these references. There is in the representations of the pavos an element of satire, even of sarcasm,</page><page sequence="7">"MÁS LEJOS, NEGREABAN LOS PAVOS" 5 1 though always these seem muted - though muted in far from silent or inarticulate Miró 's "insinuación" is always more penetrating and per- vasive (not to mention persuasive) than direct frontal confrontation. So it seems clear, in this imagistic context at least, that Miró does not place "religious conflicts into a new perspective in which they lose all importance." Nor does his literature, "represent the liquidation of the nineteenth-century assaults on the Church" (Dendle 92). Understood correctly, his imagery gives away nothing in the sharpness and focus of its implied criticism. That focus, however, takes shape along different lines and in a different light than one would initially expect. In Miró 's works, the priests are high on the local and national pecking order. It is an "animal farm" in which certain animals are definitely more equal than others. For him, "Oleza teocrática" and even "España levítica" are a function of essentially the same forces that other contemporary writers have assailed. The typical "novela con cura" as Manuel Azaña has char- acterized this literary institution, 2 is refracted in a "novela con pavos," a clever and coherent esperpento 3 that approaches the reality of the human condition and the national situation far more adroitly than foot-stomping, fist-shaking, or the like. Miró 's is an iconoclasm relying on devastatingly subtle and simple imagery. University of Wyoming 2 Márquez Villanueva 22, cites Azaña 's article "Los curas oprimidos," published orig- inally in 1922. Concerning Miró and Roman Catholic priests, cf. Rubio Cremades 94-97, and Larsen, "£7 hijo santo ", 63-83. On the anticlericalism of the other writers, see De- vlin. 3 Ontañón de Lope, Estudios 87-107, discusses what she calls "La España esperpénti- ca" in Miró 's works. She focuses, among other themes, on both "animalización" and "hu- manización." Works Cited Allen, Mary. Animals in American Literature. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1983. Altisent, Marta.
