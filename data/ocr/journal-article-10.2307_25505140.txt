With historical note by F. J. Byrne Plates XVII-LXI [Received, 12 September, 1966. Read, 12 June, 1967. Published, 19 July, 1968.] INTRODUCTION The large tumulus of Knowth1 is one of the three great monuments of the Brugh na B?inne2 passage grave cemetery. This site (and its immediate neighbourhood) has attracted attention throughout many periods. Its initial and primary phase of use was during the Neolithic when its function was sepulchral. During the Early Christian period there was occupation on the site and it gave its name to a dynasty of kings. It was sacked both by natives and foreigners and seemingly fortified by the Normans. It has a place in Irish mythology and has frequently been mentioned in the early Irish literature. In modern times, with the growth of antiquarianism in the 19th century, Knowth received its share of attention and from the middle of the last century it has been briefly described on many occasions by, amongst others, Wakeman (1848, 108), Wilde (1949, 164-65), Borlase, (1897, 370-71), Coffey (1912, 60-61) and ? R?ord?in and Daniel (1964, 72-77). The first attempt at 1 The National Grid reference is N996735 and the coordinates on the O.S. 6* sheet Co. Meath 19 are 68-2 cms from west and 15-5 cms from south. 2 The area is usually considered as the place referred to in the early Irish literature as Brugh na B?inne (cf. Coffey, 1912, 20-28). On account of the fortified nature of the Los Millares township and other such sites in Iberia (Blance, 1961) it may be of interest to note that the name Brugh means *burgh* or town, a fortified town and in a restricted sense a mansion, palace or dwelling place (Borlase, 1897, 346). While definite evidence for the presence of a 'citadel* at Brugh na B?inne is lacking yet within the cemetery bounds there are three structures which call for mention. These are the large circular earthwork near Dowth, a second structure near the Boyne below Newgrange (? R?ord?in and Daniel, 1964, 87) and there is also a large earth work i mile north-east of Knowth (? R?ord?in and Daniel, 1964, PI. 53, site incorrectly given as north of Dowth) and another a short distance to the south-west. The date and purpose of these sites are unknown but their occurrence at Brugh na B?inne and also near Fourknocks (Hartnett, 1957, 265, No. 9) at least suggest that they form part of the complex at both areas. The two circular earthworks in Knowth townland, however, appear to be ringforts. On that account and in view of the numerous references to the area in early Irish literature perhaps one should now at least ask if there is a possibility that the Dowth and Newgrange earthworks could also be associated with Early Christian occupation.

Macalister (1943). He investigated the interior of the tomb of Site 2 and ''beginning at the eastern side and proceeding round the mound right-hand wise'3 traced the kerb of Site 1 for "a little more than half-way uncovering 58 stones" (Macalister, 1943, pp. 136, 134). In addition to the large mound, surface features (already noted by Coffey and supplemented by Macalister's excavations) showed that there were smaller structures close to it and that at least one of these was a passage grave of the undifferentiated type. It was the presence of these structures that encouraged the present campaign of excavation. The work described in this report covers a four-season period extending from 1962 to 1965. The purpose of the excavation is two-fold. Firstly, arising out of the information produced by excavation at Townleyhall (Eogan, 1963), a site that must be considered as an outlier of the main cemetery group, it was then found that information concerning the cultural and chronological context of the un differentiated passage grave in the Boyne valley neighbourhood was inade quate and the more immediate task is, therefore, to pursue this problem. Secondly, it is hoped that the work will help to expand our knowledge of the 'Boyne Culture' and that it will also contribute, even in a limited way, to the wider problems of passage grave studies in general. For the purpose of description the large tumulus has been termed Site 1 and the numeration of the small sites extends from 2 to 5 (Fig. 1 ; PL XVII). Portion of Site 1 was investigated during the 1964 and 1965 seasons. Sites 2, 3 and 6 were excavated in the course of the 1964 season, Site 4 in 1962 and Site 5 in 1963. GENERAL SUMMARY The Knowth group of monuments is situated on a hill-top and it com prises a passage grave cemetery within a cemetery. The principal site (Site 1) consists of a round mound that was constructed in a composite manner by alternating layers of redeposited sod, boulder clay, stone, shale and other materials. The mound is delimited by a kerb, a number of the stones of which are ornamented on the outside. Grouped around the perimeter of the main site and in some instances very close to its edge, are a number of small mega lithic structures. To date, five of these have been excavated (Sites 2 to 6). All had suffered extensive damage ; in some instances this consisted of the almost complete destruction of the covering mound, the tomb and most of the kerb. In addition, the construction of secondary features, such as ditches, drains and hearths caused other mutilations to take place. Despite this damage, however, excavation has established that four of the 'satellite' sites are mega lithic tombs. Although each of these is somewhat different in plan and detail, they can all be classed as undifferentiated passage graves enclosed in round mounds that were delimited by kerbs. In Sites 2-4 a transverse sill stone divided the tomb into passage and chamber and in Site 4 a low cairn was placed over the area immediately surrounding the tomb. Two of the sites</page><page sequence="3">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 301 (3 and 4) produced fairly definite evidence and Site 2 slight evidence for crema tion burial. Site 4 also contained some unburnt remains. At least two persons, an infant and an adult, were buried in Site 4. Apart from three bone pin frag ments there were no grave goods present at Site 4. Site 5 consisted of an incomplete 'kerb* and no evidence for the presence of an internal structure was found. 'Kerb' stone No. 21 was placed over part of a short curved trench in whose fill of dark earth and charcoal there were sherds of Neolithic 'A' pottery and five flint scrapers. Some of the tomb or kerb stones in Sites 2-4 bear megalithic art. A single cist burial with a stone vessel provides the only evidence hitherto for activity on the site during the Bronze Age and it is not until the latter half of the first millennium A.D. that Knowth again comes into prominence in the archaeological record. Finds from secondary burials and some isolated objects hint at ninth or tenth century activity. The place may have been used for occupation at that time and it may be noted that the kings of Northern Brega are sometimes referred to as the kings of Knowth. In the twelfth century there is documentary evidence for the Normans' use of the site as a mote. It is not possible as yet to assign any of the various secondary structures, souterrains, hearths, ditches, etc. to a specific date; but it does appear that the site again rose to be of considerable importance during the latter cen turies of the Early Christian period and the beginning of the medieval period. HISTORICAL SUMMARY (see Professor Byrne's study, infra pp. 383-400) Within the territories of the Northern and Southern Uf N?ill there were several petty kingdoms, one of which was Brega. This kingdom was ruled over by the dynasty of ?ed Sl?ine who, from 598 to 604 a.D., was "High King" of Ireland. But in 688 at the battle of Imlech Pich the dynasty was split and two kingdoms, Northern Brega and Southern Brega, were established On several occasions the kings of Northern Brega are styled kings of Cnogba (Knowth), although it would seem that this title was hardly used much before the year 800. The earliest recorded occurrence seems to have been in 788 when Gormgal, son of ?ladach, king of Knowth died. He was, however, not of the U? N?ill dynasty but apparantly a king of the Gailenga. In 818 the obituary of Cernach mac Congalaig, 'rex CnodbaV, is recorded. Through out the succeeding centuries Knowth and its kings are frequently mentioned and Congalach mac M?elmithig, often referred to as Congalach Cnogba (944-956), made a successful attempt to secure the High Kingship. There is also the often-quoted annalistic entry under the year 863, which records that the three kings of the Dublin Norse, Amlaim, Imar and Auisle, together with Lor can mac Cathail, er? Mide* (of the Clann Cholm?in), ravaged the lands of Flann mac Conaing of the Northern Brega dynasty and plundered, amongst other places, the 'caves' of Knowth and Dowth. The following year Lor can</page><page sequence="4">302 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, was blinded and deposed by the High King ?ed mac N?ill and around the same time there was a shift in alliance; Flann mac Conaing had now joined the Norse against ?ed. However, soon afterwards, when Flann was defeated and slain at the Battle of Cell ua nDaigre in 868, he was referred to as 'ri Breg n-uile* (King of all Brega)? In the tenth century M?elmithig mac Flannac?in, who died in 919, bore the title King of Knowth, During this century Knowth came upon difficult times: in 935 the site, together with Lagore, was attacked by the Vikings; later in the century M?elsechlainn II seems to have attempted the extirpation of the Brega Dynasty and in 991 Donnchad, King of Brega, was slain. The dynasty seems to have withstood this assault and in Northern Brega the hereditary rulers?represented by the families of Ua Cellaig and Ua Conga laig?survived, although these were also 'plebeian5 kings of Bre?a. In 1028 a Flannac?n Ua Cellaig was king of Brega and a Muirchertach Ua Cellaig bore the same title in 1161. Their surnames suggest that these must have belonged to the Northern Brega line. A reference in one of the charters (dated (1129X 1146) in the Book of Kells mentions Cellach Hua Cellaig ri Breg ocus Hua Dondghaile toisech tuaithi Cnogba. Knowth, it appears, passed out of Irish hands around 1175 ; for in that year it was used as a mote by the Normans and about the same time it became part of the grange of the Cistercian Abbey at Mellifont. Part I. The Megalithic Structures SITE 1 (Figs. 1, 6-8; Pis, XVII-XXI). This site is situated on the highest point of a low hill, the summit of which is slightly over 200 feet above sea level. To the south, the site commands an extensive view over the plains of Meath with the Dublin and Wicklow moun tains visible in the distance; but on the north-west and north, Barristown and Slane Hills, Sliabh Breagh, Mount Oriel and the Coll?n hills and the high ground to the north-east restrict the view in those directions. Due to the limited area excavated it is not yet possible to give accurate measurements, but the monument appears to cover a circular area about 90 m in diameter and about 300 m in circumference. The area covered would thus seem to be about 6,300 sq. m and the structure is approximately 11-9 m in height. The surface of the mound is now grass-covered and when viewed from the south it presents a regular hemispherical-shaped outline. However, closer examination shows that in places the surface is quite irregular. For instance, the centre is hollowed and a depression leads up to this from the south-east side. These features may be the result of robbing for road-making and it may be noted that in 1848 Wakeman wrote that 'for many years it had served as a convenient quarry for builders of houses and repairs of roads' (Wakeman, 1848, 108). As a result of the work of Macalister (1943, 134-140) it was clear that the</page><page sequence="5">Eooan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 303 mound was delimited by a kerb and the tips of a number of kerb stones remained visible. As already remarked, Macalister exposed fifty-eight stones and amongst these are kerbs Nos. 18-34 (Macalister Nos. 59-43). On the west and south sides in particular, the edge of the mound did not rise upwards immediately from the tops of the kerbs. On the inside of the kerb stones a flattened area occurs, a feature due to the presence of a secondary ditch (see p. 355). The present excavation exposed a total of thirty-four kerb stones, the material and dimensions of which are as follows3: Type of rock Maximum Dimensions (in cms) Length Width H?ght Green cleaved grit Green cleaved grit Cleaved green slate Limestone Green cleaved grit Limestone Green slate Green slate Limestone Sandy limestone Crinoidal limestone Sandy limestone Limestone Limestone Limestone Limestone Green grit Weathered limestone Weathered limestone Limestone Limestone Cleaved grit Cleaved grit Cleaved grit Slate with sandy lenses Cleaved grit Cleaved grit Grit Cleaved grit Cleaved grit Cleaved grit Cleaved grit Grit Cleaved grit 265 160 191 90 208 131 239 224 170 161 200 146 121 190 154 180 140 190 181 164 180 246 225 216 205 290 265 210 187 176 190 258 210 205 56 39 44 54 25 62 27 48 83 70 49 20 64 42 42 77 53 70 80 86 36 65 57 70 36 59 71 45 51 45 105 91 95 8 AH the geological identifications are by Prof. G.

On the northern side these are small, for instance among kerb stones 1-14 only two are over 100 cms in height (Pis. XXIIIa and XXVIIIb) whereas extending around the western side all examples after No. 22 are over 100 cms in height (PL XXb). On the northern side the stones were placed on the old ground surface and in some instances wedge stones were placed at the base to consolidate them; but on the western side most of the kerb stones were inserted into sockets (some of which reached 30 cms in depth) and they were further secured by the addition of packing-stones. The Mound This was constructed by the depositing of different material in an ordered fashion (PI. XXIa). The construction (as is best shown in Section 15-16, Fig. 8), consists of a basal layer of material that seems to be redeposited sod4. On top of this were layers of loose stones, shale, redeposited boulder clay, * A sample of this material has been analysed by Mr. M. Gardiner, The Agricultural Institute, who reports that "it would appear that the basal layer of the mound is formed from redeposited sod. This is evident from the relatively high carbon content (4-4%) in this sample. This hypothesis is further supported by the material's relatively high nitrogen content ('5%). From aie relatively high phosphate content in the sample analysed it would appear that the area from which the sod was removed was not just waste scrub, as one would not expect such a phosphorus content in that type of areaV</page><page sequence="7">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 305 shale, loose stones, sod, shale, shale and stones, shale, loose stones, shale and boulder clay. There was no evidence for the presence of a natural sod layer, rather the redeposited sod seems to have been laid on the boulder clay. A layer of iron pan now intervenes between both. In the basal layer there are a number of black lenses, which seem to indicate that the sods often con tained a high content of organic material (e.g. grass). Pieces of twigs are also present and this must show that at least some of the sod was collected in an area producing a scrub vegetation. The dark lenses are found at angles to each other; this is probably due to the fact that tip heaps were formed during the construction. In the body of the mound some layers of redeposited boulder clay and shale give a wavy appearance; this may be due to adjust ment caused by the settling of the mound. Another feature of the layering is that at some points the shale and sod layers interlock. A feature of con siderable note is that over the area excavated the layering arrangement is fairly constant and this shows that the mound must have been constructed as part of a single operation. Finds An artifact discovered was a crescent-shaped piece of flint (Fig. 20: 1) worked along the convex edge and most likely part of a large end- or thumb scraper. It was found in the basal redeposited sod layer opposite kerb stone No. 27. Nearby was an irregular piece of flint (Fig. 20: 2). This has a bulbar swelling on one side. Opposite this there is a straight edge that was finely worked, and on the inside of this there is a thin band of lustre. Part of the surface retains cortex. The only other flint that came from the undisturbed mound, and again from the basal sod layer, was a small flake (Fig. 20: 3). This shows slight evidence of use. Two flints were found in a disturbed position: in the fill of Ditch 1, opposite kerb stone No. 23, a flint nodule turned up, which had one bulbous surface and the other, convex with secondary working (Fig. 20: 4). Also, a round scraper (Fig. 20: 5) was found in upcast outside the kerb opposite kerb stone No. 22. It is well made from dark and grey banded flint and has been worked right round the perimeter. On the upper surface a patch of cortex survives.

There were no indications</page><page sequence="8">306 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, of a mound or kerb before excavation, but that a structure did exist on the site was known from at least as long ago as 1912. George CofTey noted the tips of some stones protruding (some orthostats of the tomb) and these were taken by him as forming part of an entrance passage to Site 1 (CofTey, 1912, 61). Subsequently the interior of the chamber and passage was excavated under the direction of Professor Macalister but he did not investigate the surrounding area (Macalister, 1943, 132-134). 0' Fiq. 2?Site 2, ground plan. The Tomb (Figs. 2, 3; PI. XXIIIb) While this structure can be termed an undifferentiated passage grave yet demarcation between passage and chamber is clearly marked. For instance the passage is formed by a number of orthostats while the sides of the chamber are formed by two large blocks. Furthermore, a transverse sill stone adds additional emphasis to the demarcation between passage and chamber. In internal length the grave is 5*40 m. It is aligned NNE/SSW and the entrance is on the SSW side facing to Site 1. The passage, 3-40 m long, was formed by eleven orthostats, six on the eastern side and five on the western, but one of these (No. 5) is missing. Orthostats 1, 7, 10 were simply held in place by packing-stones at the base. Nos. 11 and 14 stood in very shallow sockets, and the remainder were placed in sockets varying in depth from 10 to 20 cms. These stones were also supported at the base by packing-stones. At</page><page sequence="9">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 307 the entrance to the tomb and extending across its width there was a pit 30 cms in maximum depth. The fill consisted of dark earth and charcoal. This pit has not been referred to by Macalister but it may be a primary feature as was, for instance, the pit containing black soil, cremated bone and charcoal that was found at one side of the entrance to the typologically similar tomb at Bargrennan in Galloway (Piggott and Powell, 1948-49, 150). On the inside of the pit seven flat stones formed a paving of sorts over part of the floor of the passage. The plan of construction?sill stone, back stone and the two massive side stones?gives a sort of square or rectangular chamber. The chamber is 1-67 m in internal length by 1*60 m in average internal width. Neither the sill stone nor the back stone was placed in a socket and the back stone has fallen outwards. Both side stones were placed in sockets and consolidated by packing-stones. The socket for No. 6 was 46 cms in depth, and that for No. 8, 22 cms. None of the roofing stones of the tomb survived in position and these were already absent at Macalister's time. However, on the outside of orthostat No. 9 a slipped-oif capstone was found (Sections I-J; Fig. 7). The material and dimensions of the orthostats are as follows : No. Type of rock Maximum Dimensions (in cms) Length Width Height 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Sill Green slate Green slate Green cleaved grit Green cleaved grit Green slate Green cleaved grit Green cleaved grit Green cleaved grit Micaceous sand stone Green cleaved grit Green cleaved grit Green cleaved grit Green cleaved grit Green slate 44 30 50 80 295 173 238 58 65 78 34 28 43 120 20 30 19 22 67 35 82 30 36 26 12 13 32 38 135 135 134 140 178 90 164 140 125 135 125 136 130 64 The Kerb and the Mound (Figs. 2, 6, 7; Pis. XXIIb, XXIIIa) The kerb was incomplete on the northern side and the missing portion may have been destroyed when the secondary structures were being built (see below). Twenty kerb stones survive. With the exception of No. 1, which has slid into the edge of the drain (PL XVII), all are in their original position and the stretch extending from No. 3 to No. 18 is complete. The stones were placed on top of the old surface; there were no sockets but some have packing stones at the base. The kerb enclosed a circular area about 12.50 m in</page><page sequence="10">308 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. diameter. This area was covered by a mound made from redeposited boulder clay, but only the lower layers, rising to a maximum height of 60 cms, survived (PL XXIVa). On the eastern side of the passage a fire had been lit on the old ground surface (Fireplace I)5 and to the north of the tomb there was a pit 48 cms in depth (Pit I)6. The fill contained a considerable amount of charcoal. Both pit and fill are primary features: they were sealed by the undisturbed mound.

Weekes (Trinity College, Dublin) found too fragmented even to say if they are human bones, were found on the old ground surface at the southern end of orthostat 6. It may be remarked that the tomb had previously been cleared out down to the un disturbed subsoil, but Macalister did not record any finds. Two flint scrapers were found. One example discovered on top of the old surface under the mound and 50 cms to the north-east of Pit 1, is a well formed thumb-shaped scraper (Fig. 20: 6) that was fashioned from a grey coloured flint flake. The artifact expands outwards from the bulbar end to 5 Miss M.

The passage, 3 m long, is constructed of a total of eleven orthostats?six on the western side and five on the eastern, but of these only five (Nos. 1,2, 18, 19 and 20) remain undamaged. The upper portions of Nos. 3, 4 and 5 have been broken off. Three capstones survive. Two of these are over orthostats 1 and 20, and 2 and 19; the third lies in an almost vertical position between kerb stone No. 16 and orthostats 1 and 20 (PL XXVIa). The chamber is 2*50 m in internal length. It was formed by four orthostats on each side and a back stone, but none of these now survive. All the orthostats of the tomb and the sill stone were placed in sockets (c. 20 cms in depth) and held in place by packing-stones at their bases. The material and dimensions of the orthostats are as follows: No. Type of rock Maximum Dimensions (in cms) Length Width Height 1 2 3 4 5 18 19 20 Sill Slate Dolomitic limestone Green grit Calcareous sandstone Calcareous sandstone Cleaved grit Limestone Fine-grained grit Limestone 46 50 54 35 46 60 48 53 8 20 22 23 31 44 22 34 36 10 93 129 124 128 110 53 The Mound and Kerb (Figs. 4, 6, 7; Pis. XXIVb, XXVa) On the northern side the kerb is incomplete, due to secondary dis turbance. The surviving portion encloses an irregularly-shaped area slightly over 11 m in maximum width. With the exception of the orthostats missing from sockets 30 and 32 the stretch of kerb from Nos. 2 to 33 is complete. No. 1 may be a kerb stone thrown off from its original position as may also be the three stones on the northern side. With the exception of Nos. 18 to 23 all the other kerb stones were placed in shallow sockets and some were further consolidated by basal packing-stones. Nos. 18 to 23 are much smaller than the other kerb stones and in order to bring these up to the same height as the others they were placed on top of a construction of small stones (cf.

The tops of Nos. 6 and 7 also showed up as did that of the orthostat that stood in tomb-socket 4. Thanks largely to the existence of the kerb stones, the edge of a mound could be traced along the northern side; but on the other sides the surface was quite flat and merged into the adjoining land, the present surface of which is considerably higher than the old ground level.

The Tomb and Cairn (Figs. 9, 10; PL XXX) The tomb, which was in a ruined condition, was aligned N-S with the entrance on the southern side. It was constructed of at least fifteen ortho stats, seven on each side and one at the back; but, due to the destruction, only the back stone and two of the side stones remained, and of these only one (No. 4) was in its original position and survived intact. No. 4 is a micaceous grit block, 1-14 m in maximum height. The inner face is flat; but it widens outwards irregularly at the back to reach a maximum width of 55 cms at about midpoint. The orthostat, also a micaceous grit, that stood in socket No. 5, had been pushed forward to the side of the socket, and its upper portion broken off. The large back stone was prostrate. This is a sandstone, 1-27 m in maximum height, and at the base it is 1 m in width by 36 cms in thickness. The reason for considering this block as the back stone is due to the fact that it has a thick and wide butt that would allow it to stand upright and balance easily in position in the shadow socket discovered at the back. When this stone was found its narrow and thinner end was towards the socket. However, due to the weight of its broad end it would have been most difficult to erect with its narrow end downwards, and then on account of its top heaviness it would have been an almost impossible task to keep it standing. It would, therefore, appear that this stone must first have been knocked backwards and then shoved forward in an attempt to remove it from the site. The face of the stone that was uppermost when discovered is slightly concave and pecked over most of this surface (PL Llllb). An exception was a band 20 cms</page><page sequence="20">318 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. wide running parallel to the broad edge; it may be suggested that this band was covered as a result of insertion into the socket or of packing around the base. It would seem that the pecking was done to create a reasonably smooth surface; there was no ornamental scheme. If the stone had been erected on its broad end it must have been intended to have the pecked face, rather than the other uneven surface, facing into the tomb. In general, the sockets for the orthostats averaged 15 cms in depth, al though in some cases, such as Nos. 4 and 10, the uprights were mainly held in place by wedge stones. With the exception of the back stone (No. 8) all the orthostats were well secured by packing-stones. In plan the tomb might be described as trapezoidal. It widened from 45 cms at the entrance to 130 cms between the two innermost sockets. While there is no structural distinction between passage and chamber a division is, Fio. 9?Site 4, ground plan of megalithic tomb.</page><page sequence="21">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 319 nevertheless, emphasised by the presence of a sill stone which was placed in a transverse position. Only a small portion of the sill survived but its socket, 1*14 m long, emerged clearly. Of the surviving part of the sill (45 cms in height) 25 cms had been placed in the socket. The tomb as revealed is 6-75 m in length, but it cannot be established if this was its total original length as the cutting of a later ditch (see below) destroyed part of the mound along its southern side. However, it may be that the structure is complete because if it extended at the entrance for even another socket on each side, and assuming that it continued to narrow at the same rate, it would have been impossible to enter the tomb at all unless a short portion were left unroofed. The tomb was enclosed within a cairn somewhat oval in shape. On the western side it was quite irregular, but on the north and east the edge was delimited by stones regularly placed and larger than those used in the body of the cairn. The gap in the cairn kerb on the eastern side is due to the insertion of a later hearth (Hearth 4, see below). The Mound and Kerb (Figs. 9, 12, 13; Pis. XXXIa, b) Excavation established that an earthen mound of only 75 cms in maximum height survived; but this must be the result of considerable denudation. Practically none of the original mound remained over the cairn and consider able interference had also taken place at other points (see sections, Figs. 12, 13). Except for a small stony area along the north-east side the surviving part of the mound was largely composed of dark shaly material, although at some points, especially on the west side, the basal 20 cms or so were sticky and tended to be greyish in colour suggesting that sods may have been used. If this is so there was no clear demarcation between the two materials. Under most of the mound the original surface consisting of a sod layer could be clearly distinguished and over large areas of its surface a layer of iron pan, about 1 cm in thickness, occurred. A total of seven kerb stones survived and of these six (Nos. 1-6) were in their original positions. As none was inserted into a socket but simply held in place by packing-stones where needed, it cannot be established if originally the kerb was continuous although the presence of four examples (Nos. 1-4) placed end-to-end is suggestive and the occurrence of some small stones that look like wedge-stones between kerbs Nos. 5 and 6 (PL XXXIa) may indicate that another kerb stone stood there. From the curvature of the positioned kerb stones found in situ (Nos. 1-6) it would seem that the kerb enclosed an area of about 15 m in diameter. Kerb stones Nos. 1-4 (PL XXXIb) are substantial blocks that average 1-40 m in length by 87 cms high. No. 1 is an agglomerate, No. 2 a limestone, No. 3 a dolomitic limestone and No. 4 dolerite. No. 5, a dolomitic limestone, is 1-50 m in length by 75 cms high. Kerb stone No. 6 is an irregularly-shaped sandstone that weathers easily. It is 55 cms long by 71 cms high. This stone had partially fallen outwards (Fig. 12, Section A-B) and when raised the outer face was found to possess some decoration (see p. 351).</page><page sequence="22">320 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.

Further flakes of cremated bone, obviously thrown out, were scattered nearby.

Tip of a polished bone pin (Fig. 20: 23), 17-5mm long, of D-shaped cross section and 4 mm in width at the fracture, was found in the chamber (under neath fallen orthostat) with cremated bone.

In the sod and throughout the surviving part of the mound a total of thirty-nine flints was discovered but of these only one, a barbed-and-tanged arrowhead, is a definite implement. Of the remainder, nineteen show some evidence of manufacture but in most instances this is exceedingly slight. The best examples are described and illustrated (Fig. 20). No. 1 Barbed-and-tanged flint arrowhead of honey-coloured flint (Fig. 20: 8a). The tang has been broken off and one barb is slightly longer than the other. Except for a patch of cortex on one face the surface has been well worked over. On the other side the working is chiefly along the edges. Found in the stony fill of the large pit (Fig. 13, Section I-J). No. 2 Thumb scraper (Fig. 20: 14). This exceedingly crude artifact was made from pebble flint and a considerable portion of cortex remains on one surface. The bulb of percussion is prominent. The scraping edge is fairly steep. It was found on the surface of the undisturbed material on the southern edge of Hearth 2 (Fig. 11 ) but shows no evidence of burning. The following six pieces, all found in undisturbed parts of the mound, are the more distinctive of the flints that showed signs of use : No. 3 (Fig. 20: 15). Made from a thin piece of flint. The working is confined to one edge. The object has been burnt. No. 4 (Fig. 20: 16). Made from portion of blade. At one end there is a bulb of percussion and the platform is inclined at an angle to the long edges. Along one of the latter there is slight evidence of working. Burnt. No. 5 (Fig. 20: 17). There is working all around the edge of this object, but each long edge and the top is worked from a different side. No. 6 (Fig. 20: 18). This object, which is more or less crescentic in shape, has slight working along the convex face. The fragment may be part of a thumb-scraper. No. 7 (Fig. 20: 19). Rough piece of flint with bulb of percussion at one end and cortex adhering to part of one surface. Along one side there is clear evidence of use. No. 8 (Fig. 20: 20). An outer flake. The cortex is fairly fresh. The broader end has been slightly worked.

SITE 5 Site 5 lies to the S.W. of Site 4 and only a distance of 1 m intervenes between both. Structure Visible Before Excavation (PL XXIXb) The area was quite flat, the only evidence for structure occurred on the north side where the tops of kerb stones Nos. 2, 3 and 4 protruded slightly. At this point the ground outside the kerb was slighdy lower than on the inside of it. The top of kerb No. 1 was also just visible. The Curved Trench ("Neolithic trench" on Fig. 15) This was 4?60 m long and was aligned N-S with a slight curvature. It reached a maximum depth of 37 cms. The trench was narrower and shallower at the ends than in the middle and a short distance in from each end there was a low transverse ridge. On the southern side of the ridge on the northern end the trench narrowed to 27 cms for a distance of 30 cms.

At the top of the fill there was a thick layer of charcoal and this extended outside the edge of the trench for a short distance. This charcoal layer was denser around the middle where it was 5 cms in maximum thickness. The fill underneath this was dark soil that contained a fair mixture of charcoal.

Scraper. The working is confined to one edge. This object, which has been subjected to heat, is made from a rough blade. At one point there is cortex surviving. This object was found beside the trench. In the fill of the trench four waste chips of flint and three fragments of unworked quartzite were also found. Pottery (Fig. 21) Twenty-one sherds of pottery over thumb-nail size were recovered from the trench. In addition, there were at least six other sherds that, owing to their exceedingly fragmentary condition, could not be removed intact. But all of these, as far as could be determined, were featureless body sherds. All the sherds can be assigned to the 'Western' Neolithic. No. 1 (Fig. 21: 6). Sherd consisting of part of rim and wall averaging 6 mm in thickness. The ware is fairly compact but it contains some pits and cavities. The rim turns outward at an angle. No. 2 (Fig. 21: 7). Rim sherd of ware containing some grits. It is a litde coarser than No. 1. The rim is everted and the top is slightly convex. On the outside there is a shallow groove underneath the lip. The wall is 10 mm thick. No. 3 (Fig. 21: 8). Rim fragment. The rim curves gently outward and it is slightly bulbous. The ware is of poor quality and there are some small pits and cavities present. No. 4 (Fig. 21: 9). Part of rounded outturned rim that is in form and texture somewhat similar to sherd No. 1. There are a number of cavities in the ware. No. 5 (Fig. 21: 10). Shoulder sherd that has a moderate rebate. The wall averages 8 mm in thickness. The outer surface is smooth but the inner is pitted all over. No. 6 (Fig. 21: 11). Shoulder sherd of the medium angle variety. The ware has some grits but the outer surface has been well smoothed down. The wall averages 11 mm in thickness. No. 7 (Fig. 21: 12). Shoulder sherd somewhat similar to No. 6 but the shoulder angle is slightly more pronounced. The ware contains a number of small cavities but both outer and inner surfaces have been well smoothed. No. 8 (Fig. 21: 13). Small fragments consisting of a shoulder sherd which could have come from a pot or pots similar to Nos. 6 and 7. Of the featureless body sherds two examples are illustrated. The ware of sherd No. 9 (Fig. 21: 14) has a number of tiny grits; it averages 9 mm in thickness. The outer surface is fairly smooth and the inner is carbonised.

The Megalithic Structure (Fig. 14; PL XXXIVb) This consisted of a circular area about 11*50 m in diameter enclosed by a kerb about half of which remained. A total of 21 kerb stones survived and these are matched evenly in height and in length, averaging 95 cms long by 65 cms in height. Nos. 1 to 15 and No. 21 were in their original positions but Nos. 16 to 20 had been disturbed. Nos. 16 and 17 were moved outwards slightly and No. 17 lay over the legs of Burial 5 (see below). No. 18 was close to the edge of ditch 2 (p. 355) while No. 19 lay on the inner lip of the ditch. No. 20 had been thrown into the ditch and rested in the fill (Section G-H). Nos. 2 to 15 were placed on the old ground level, in no instance was a socket dug to receive them but a number (and also No. 16) had small wedge stones inserted at the base to keep them steady. On the other hand Nos. 1 and 21 were erected a small distance above the old surface (Figs. 16, 17). No. 1 (Section K-L) was simply sitting in earth but No. 21 (Section G-H) was well supported by small stones. Three of these were thrown into the fill of the curved trench in order to act as a consolidated foundation and above them other stones were placed.

A stone was removed from the space between kerb stones Nos. 7 and 8 as a disturbed area in the section shows (Fig. 16, Section C-D). The only structure found within the circle was a pit and this is probably the result of secondary interference (p. 363). Over most of the site the subsoil consisted of boulder clay, brownish in colour; but in places the underlying shale protruded. It could not be definitely established if a mound was placed within the kerb. Most of the fill consists of dark earth which was similar to the fill in ditch 2 (pp. 355-56). But in some places, especially on the northern half, a layer of brown soil about 30 cms in thickness occurs and at the inside of kerb stone No. 12 there was a deposit of shale that ran inwards in a wedge shape and extended up over the brown soil (Section O-P, see Fig. 17). These layers, having being deposited in an orderly fashion, suggest original work. Finds Flint A total of eighteen flint chips was found but only one of these (Fig. 21: 16) shows definite evidence of working: a burnt piece of flint which was</page><page sequence="32">S30 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.

The worked edge is concave. Of the unworked pieces only one can be described as a blade and this is not a particularly good specimen. All the others are waste pieces. Discussion The purpose for which this megalithic structure was erected or the curved trench dug cannot be satisfactorily explained. Fires had been lit in the trench and it may be that it was just a fire pit, although its extent and shape make this explanation difficult to accept. Stratigraphical evidence shows that this trench is earlier than kerb stone No. 21 as this lay over part of it. It may, of course, be that the trench is con temporary with the construction of part of the kerb. Certainly, very little time can have elapsed between the period when the trench was last in use and the erection of kerb stone No. 21 as immediately under this stone three smallish stones were thrown into the fill, obviously in order to act as a founda tion for the kerb stone. If the trench long antedated the kerb the use of these stones would hardly have been necessary, as surely the area of the trench would have hardened up and would not be at all noticeable.</page><page sequence="33">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 331 With regard to the use of the megalithic structure, this is likely a passage grave, the tomb of which was either completely destroyed or never constructed. Date As it seems reasonable to assume that both trench and kerb were con temporary, a Neolithic date is indicated. SITE 6 This site is situated on the western side of Site 1 and 120 m away from it.

The only surface indications visible before excavation were the tips of kerb stones Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and very slight traces of a mound.

Only four definite sockets came to light (Nos. 1, 10, 11 and 12) but eight other holes, some of which may have served as sockets, were discovered. But there must have been other sockets, and some of those on the plan (e.g. No. 7) hardly held orthostats. However, the tomb appears to have been an un differentiated passage grave, 5-40 m in internal length and aligned roughly east-west with the entrance on the east. Its internal width at the entrance was about 60 cms and at the back about 1-20 m. The sockets averaged 12 cms in depth.</page><page sequence="35">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co.

Originally the mound would have been around 10 m in diameter. On the north-east and south-east sides the mound survived to approximately its original extent but on the western side a considerable portion was missing. This can be attributed to the fact that the land slopes away on the west side and it was easier to remove the mound on that side.</page><page sequence="36">334 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.

Finds* The sole primary find on Site 6 was a flint double hollow-scraper (Fig. 20: 21). This was discovered in the material of the mound. The hollow at the end opposite the bulb is deep and crescentic. The hollow on the side is shallower. Along one edge there is slight evidence of use. ART The structural stones of four of the sites investigated were decorated. In nearly all instances the art is found on the outside of the kerb stones and on the inside of the tomb stones. The exceptions to this rule are orthostat 8 of Site 2, which is decorated on the inside and outside; kerb stone*No. 4 of Site 2, which has decoration on one end ; kerb stone No. 24 of Site 3, which is decorated on the top only, and kerb stones Nos. 26 and 27 of Site 1 and No. 15 of Site 3 which have ornament on the top as well as the outer face. There are no indications that the surfaces were previously prepared. Incised orna ment is found on six stones only, kerb stones Nos. 1 and 5 (in combination with pecking) of Site 1, orthostats 4, 8 (both in combination with pecking) and 10 of the tomb of Site 2 and orthostat 3 of Site 3. In all other instances the designs have been pecked and in some instances, orthostat 8 of Site 2 for example, the pecked areas were subsequently smoothed down. Grits, usually the green, cleaved variety, are those most frequently ornamented. Of the thirty-two decorated stones described twenty-three are grits. The other nine stones are divided between slates (3), sandstones (4) and limestones (2). In the following description and accompanying Table the designs are listed, as far as is practicable, after Piggott's classification (Piggott, 1954, pp. 211-213, Fig. 33). The principal motifs are shown in Fig. 22 and in the Table, where distribution of the designs and the number of times that they occur are shown. SITE 1?The Kerb Stone 1 (Fig. 23; PL XXXVIa). At the centre there is a well-formed 'net' pattern and to its left one similar, but incomplete, is found. These patterns are formed by lightly incised lines. Stone 2 (Fig. 23; PL XXXVIb). This stone has a single design that con sists of two concentric semi-circles. Above this on the right some pecking occurs. Stone 3 (Fig. 23; PL XXXVIIa). The central portion is occupied by a rounded, zigzag motif. In the centre of the body two bulges occur and these give the effect of a sort of 'hour glass' junction. Above there is some slight pecking.</page><page sequence="39">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co.

Meath, 1962-65. 339 Stone 5 (Fig. 23; PI. XXXVIIb). On the upper part of this stone (from left to right) there is a gapped circle, a small circle with a pecked line on each side and two double concentric circles. The outer member of one of the latter is incomplete but this can be attributed to a fault in the stone. Outside the other double concentric circle there are parts of what may have been or intended to have been a third member. The four patterns on the lower part of the stone are all formed from incised lines. Three of these are 'net5 patterns and the other is a triple arc with horizontal line at the right bottom. The hollows on the surface of the stone are natural features. Stone 8 (Fig. 24; PL XXXVIIIa). The design consists of a short, rounded zigzag with a single circle above the right hand side. Stone 23 (Fig. 24; PI. XXXVII lb). The single design on this stone can best be described as a multiple arc consisting of nine members. Some of the members narrow into a point in the centre and this results in a sort of?cocked hat5 shape. Stone 24 (Fig. 24; PI. XXXIXa). Single design consisting of an arc of six members. On the left side the four interior members pair off as each pair is almost joined together at the end. Stone 26 (Fig. 25; PI. XXXIXb, XLa). Decorated on both the top and the outer face. On the top there is a poorly executed spiral of two and a half turns, a concentric circle, a semi-circle and an oval. A lateral pecked area is attached to the circle and oval, and between them there is a semi-circle with some pecking above it. The design on the outer face consists of a multiple arc of ten members. Stone 27 (Fig. 25; PI. XLb, XLIa). Also decorated on both top and outer face. The single design on the top consists of a short zigzag with 'head'. Most of the outer face of the stone is covered with a series of seven gapped circles and one double concentric circle. The central part of the stone has three multiple gapped circles. That on the left, the largest, has an oval in the centre and this is enclosed by three rings and part of a fourth. The middle design has four members and that on the right three. On each side at the bottom of the middle circle there are two small gapped circles of two members each. In contrast to the other examples on the same stone, these have the gap at the lower side. The two gapped circles above the main designs are incom plete. Nearby there is some pecking. On the back (left top corner as shown in PI. XLb) there is a hint at spiral ornament but from examination this appears to be a natural feature. Stone 28 (Fig. 26 ; PL XLIb). The principal design consists of a rectangular zigzag of eighteen curves. This is, so to speak, partly sitting on top of a hori zontal line the ends of which turn upwards at an angle. Above the zigzag there is a row of nine arcs. The three left examples and that on the extreme right of the stone are open to the left, the remainder open to the right.

On the upper part of the stone there is a spiral with outer attachment, a double and a triple concentric circle and some pecking. Stone 29 (Fig. 26; PL XLIIa). The single motif consists of a double gapped circle; the outer member is less complete than the inner. Stone 30 (Fig. 26; PL XLIIb). A distinctive rounded zigzag of seventeen curves extends across the upper part of the stone. Stone 31 (Fig. 27; PL XLIIIa). The single design consists of eight gapped concentric arcs of circles. As part of the upper portion of the stone has flaked away some of the design may have been destroyed. Stone 32 (Fig. 27; PL XLIIIb). Most of the outer face of this stone is decorated. The design consists of a series of gapped and concentric circles. There are two single concentric circles, three multiple concentric circles and five gapped multiple circles. The central member of one of the latter designs consists of a circle and in another instance the position of the gap in the inner member does not correspond to the gap in the outer members. The two middle members of this motif coalesce. Stone 33 (Fig. 27; PL XLIVa). On the left hand side there is a design consisting of four curved lines with the two lowermost examples joined at one end. To the right of this there is a further line in the form of an arc. Stone 34 (Fig. 28: 1 ; PL XLIVb). Some rough pecking is found in lines at the top left-hand corner. A design is not apparent but at one point a small arc occurs. Stone over passage of Souterrain 1 (Fig. 28: 2; PL XL Va). This stone has seven motifs, two are true circles, four approximately circles and the seventh is D-shaped in outline. All are lightly pecked. Stone (Fig. 28: 3). This consists of two fragments of a larger stone, bearing a spiral design. Discovered by Macalister (1943, No. 39, Fig. 10: 36) on the outside of the kerb of Site 1 and seemingly fairly close to kerb stone No. 34 (Macalister No. 43) from which, in his opinion, they had become detached, they were placed by him in the tomb of Site 2. Here they were found, in 1964, where he had concealed them. Of the three fragments published by Macalister only two have been discovered by the writer. These have now been placed for safety underneath the partially-fallen orthostat 7 (the back stone) of the tomb of Site 2. SITE 2.?The Tomb Orthostat 4 (Fig. 28: 4; PL XLVb). This stone has a spiral of four and two-thirds turns and to the left there is a lobe-like design. Below it a pecked area occurs.

At one point this forms a sort of irregular net pattern. Lower down the stone there are two cup-and-circle designs although in one of these the cup may be joined to the circle. Between these there is a faint design that re sembles a spiral with a single turn. Orthostat 7 (Fig. 28: 5). Some pecking is noticeable on the inner surface of this stone but this is very faint and the designs are almost obliterated. How ever, two single gapped circles and an arc can be detected as well as some other slight pecking that does not form a design. Macalister (1943, 134, Fig. 3: 3) considered that the stone was more highly ornamented and his illustration of it shows ten single circles as well as zigzags. Orthostat 8. The inner face of this stone was exposed by Macalister and he has described it as the "most elaborately decorated stone of its size yet found in Ireland" (Macalister, 1943, 133, Fig. 2, PL XI: 2) but he did not know that the outer face was also equally elaborately decorated. The inner face (Fig. 29; PL XLVI). Due to the danger of the stone's col lapsing it has not been possible to expose the bottom part and some motifs may have escaped recording. Most of the surface bears ornament. The principal motifs are as follows:? 1. This motif suggests a schematised human face and body (PL XL Villa). This figure, which is placed face downwards, occupies the top right-hand central area. The face (shown in profile) is pointed, the eye is present and what may be an ear is outlined. The body takes the form of con centric circles and the male genital organ is portrayed. 2. Circles. (a) Single circles. (b) Multiple circles. (c) Gapped or incomplete circles. One design (at the bottom left) consists of a cup mark flanked on one side by six semi-circles. 3. Hurdle-patterns. (a) Vertebrates. (b) Comb-shaped. 4. Zigzags. (a) Angular zigzag or chevron-like pattern. (b) Linear rounded zigzags or serpent motifs. (c) Linear zigzags with flat bottoms and tops to the curves. (d) Meander. 5.

The spiral at the top left hand corner is superimposed on part of the "fir tree" pattern and on a triangle. Orthostat 10 (Fig. 28: 6). Macalister recorded a zigzag on this stone (Macalister 1943, 133, Fig. 3 beneath No. 2). It is rather weathered and it is hard to state if this is megalithic art. The same applies to the horizontal groove on orthostat 13 and the "abrasion" on 14. SITE 2?The Kerb Stone 4 (Fig. 31: 1 ; PL XLIXa). On the southern end there is a zigzag with rounded curves. One end terminates in a swelling. Below to the left there is a small pecked area. Stone 5. A tiny arc or gapped circle, 6*5 cms in height and 4 cms in width occurs on the back of this stone. This may be due to weathering rather than to design. Stone 6 (Fig. 31: 2; PL XLIXb). Two spirals. That on the left has two and a half turns and there is an arc attached to it laterally. The other spiral is unfinished but apparently it was intended to produce a spiral of four turns. Between the two spirals some pecking is found. SITE 3?The Tomb Stone 3 (Fig. 31: 3; PL La). This stone has a number of fine incised lines, not arranged in a pattern. A small pecked area also occurs. SITE 3?The Kerb Stone 15 (Fig. 31: 4; PL Lb). Both the top and the outer face bear ornament. The upper surface has a spiral of three turns but this is slightly damaged due to shattering in the texture of the stone. There are two designs on the outer face. To the left there is a small gapped circle, surrounded by an oval and with another gapped oval outside this. The other design consists of three concentric gapped circles. Stone 16 (Fig. 31: 5 ; PL Lia). Due to the weathered nature of this stone (a sandstone) the true form of the design cannot be ascertained but tentatively a spiral within a spiral is suggested. To the left of this there are the remains of a design that may have consisted of three gapped circles. Stone 17 (Fig. 31: 6; PL Lib). There is some pecking in the top right hand corner. Stone 24, (Fig. 31: 7; PL Lila). The ornament?a single design?is found on the upper face of this stone. It consists of a zigzag with rounded curves, or serpent motif, with "head" at one end. Stone (Fig. 31: 8; PL Lllb). This stone was discovered standing up on one end and forming the side to the drain on the eastern side of the tomb (PL XXVIb).

Table I?The occurrence of art motifs at Knowth (see Fig. 22, p. 335).</page><page sequence="53">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 351 SITE 4 Kerb stone 6 (PL Lilla). This stone was leaning outwards ; had it remained upright all the decoration would probably have weathered away due to the softness of the rock. The ornament, which was applied by the pecking tech nique, principally consists of two groups of circles. The smaller group, which is 14 cms in diameter, has a cup mark in the centre. This was surrounded by three circles, but part of the outer one is missing owing to a flake becoming detached. Running out from the cup mark there is a groove. This is shallower than those of the circles and because of the softness of the stone it could be the result of weathering. The larger group of circles, which is about 19 cms in diameter, consists of four circles, but the outer "circle" is quite irregular. Between those two groups and on the outside of the larger group there is evidence of further pecking but, owing either to weathering or incompleteness, the designs are not clear. Most of the interior surface of the back stone of the chamber (No. 8) is pecked (PL LUIb). Discussion Practically all the art motifs found at Knowth have parallels amongst the repertoire of Irish passage grave art with its ancestry in Brittany and further south, on the schist plaques, stone or bone "idols" and symbol-ornamented pottery of the Iberian peninsula. In Brittany Gavrinis (P?quart and le Rouzic, 1927, Pis. 99-133) provides excellent parallels for a number of the motifs?zigzags with rounded curves, arcs (including the multiple plain variety, multiple with horizontal line at the bottom, multiple with the ends of some of the members closed, and multiple with some of the members tending to be pointed in the centre like the motif on Site 1, kerb stone No. 23), fir tree pattern and concentric circles. Indeed, the arrangement of circles or arcs on Site 1, kerb stone No. 32, is reminiscent of the fondness of the Gavrinis artist for covering the whole face of the stone with ornament. The grouping of circles on Site 1, kerb stone No. 27 (the larger ones occupying the central position), is reminiscent of the practice of the Breton artists, who arranged the motifs in compartments. Apart from Gavrinis other Breton sites offer further parallels for the Knowth motifs. The decorated menhir at Manio has zigzags with rounded curves and "head" (P?quart and le Rouzic, 1927, Pis. 3-5) and zigzags with straight top and bottom to the curves are found on Dolmen de Kermaillard (P?quart and le Rouzic, 1927, PL 14). Gup marks and cup-and-circle motifs are found on Table des Marchands while Petit Mont presents good parallels for the chevrons and meander zigzags and also for the arcs and rounded zigzags (P?quart and le Rouzic, 1927, Pis. 40, 69, 71). The vertebrate hurdle pattern is found (within a "shield") at Les Pierres Plates and what seems to be the comb-shaped variety occurs at Man? Lud (P?quart and le Rouzic, 1927, Pis. 91, 44). The recurved line on Site 1, kerb stone No. 33, seems fairly</page><page sequence="54">352 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. close to the design found on the top right hand corner of orthostat 1 at Man? K?rioned (P?quart and le Rouzic, 1927, PL 31). GENERAL DISCUSSION The Knowth group of monuments is dominated by the large tumulus (Site 1) with a number of lesser structures nearby. Small tombs placed close to a larger site are common in Irish passage grave cemeteries. At Brugh na B?inne, in addition to Knowth, there are the remains of two small sites to the south-west of Newgrange. At Sliabh na Caillighe (Loughcrew) a similar grouping is also found (Goffey, 1912, 78-97, Figs. 79-80) and it is of interest to note that here also the entrance to some of the small tombs face the large cairn. The grouping at Bremore, Co. Dublin, can also be cited as a parallel (Rynne, 1960). Sites 2, 3, 4 and seemingly also 6 are good examples of the undifferentiated passage grave. Like the classic passage grave (i.e. a passage leading into a well-defined chamber) undifferentiated passage graves (using the term in its loosest sense) also occur in the Iberian peninsula (Leisner, 1943, text, 355-56; 1956, 68-9) and in Brittany (Giot, 1960, 93-4; l'Helgouach, 1965, 159-164). A number of well-known examples are found in the Scilly Isles off Land's End (cf. Daniel, 1950) and in the Tramore area of Go. Waterford (Powell, 1941). The type has also been recorded in Scotland (Piggott and Powell, 1948-9, 144-153) and in Denmark (Brondsted, 1938, Fig. 201). The Iberian peninsula seems to be the homeland of the undifferentiated passage grave. In that region a number of forms are found, but in most of these a differentiation of sorts exists between tomb and chamber?a transverse sill or porthole slab divides the chamber from the pasasge. In general terms the Leisners (1943, text p. 359) assign those tombs with transverse sill to the period that extends from the full flowering of the Los Millares culture to the beginning of the El Argar culture. But the type must have been developing at an earlier date in the Los Millares culture at a time when influences from the Almerian culture still survived as Los Millares 8, for instance, with its trapezoidal flint arrowhead and flat idol shows (Leisner, 1943, text, 52 and 359, Taf. 24:3, 1 and 13). In western Iberia undifferentiated passage graves are not common, but are found principally in Portugal (Leisner, 1956, 68-9, Taf. 72). That region, however, provides a good parallel for Knowth 4 in particular: a site at Anta das Gabecas, Arrailos, in the district of Evora, Portugal, excavated by the Leisners in 1945 (Leisner, 1956, 69, Taf. 27, Bild Tafel 61: 1 and 1959, pp. 137-8, Tafel 37: 28, Bild Tafel 71). A transverse slab marks off the chamber and alongside this, on the entrance side, there is a pillar. A straighten ing-out of one side wall towards the opening and the insertion of a trans verse block emphasises a short entrance passage on the east side. The finds, which came from the forechamber, consisted of a schist plaque, amongst other things.</page><page sequence="55">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 353 None of the Breton undifferentiated passage graves has been excavated in recent years so precise dating is not available. However, Man? K?rioned bears megalithic art (P?quart and le Rouzic, 1927, p. 104, Pis. 31-37) and even in Gavrinis itself the distinction between chamber and passage is not pronounced (P?quart and le Rouzic, 1927, p. 280 with plan opposite). In Scotland the meagre dating evidence provided by the pottery sherds from Bargrennan suggests affinities with pottery from Loughcrew (Piggott and Powell, 1948-49, 150) but the Scilly-Tramore group is usually dated as late as the Middle Bronze Age (cf. Piggott, 1954, 265-67). This group may, however, represent the final movement of passage grave builders, and if undifferentiated passage graves occur at the end of the series they also occur at the beginning. As we have seen, such tombs were in use in the Iberian peninsula from an early date in the Los Millares culture, and in Brittany, to judge from the art styles, which show no evidence of degeneration. Undifferentiated passage graves seem to be contemporary with orthodox passage graves. The con clusion that thus emerges is that in the passage grave cultures of western Europe tombs that differed in plan were in simultaneous use. It appears likely, therefore, that passage graves of the undifferentiated type were also spreading northwards and westwards as part of the primary dissemination of passage graves from Iberia. On external evidence undifferentiated passage graves could then be amongst the earliest passage graves in Ireland. Despite the scarcity of finds at Knowth the presence of the art, the bone pin fragments from the chamber of Site 4 and the grouping of the tombs indicates that Sites 2-4 and 6 can be assigned to a date within the Irish passage grave culture and this date is supported by the Townleyhall evidence (Eogan, 1963). Unfortunately, this evidence is not sufficient to provide a precise date, but there is no need to assume that the tombs listed must be the latest in the series. So the position seems to be that in the Brugh na B?inne cemetery (as in Iberia and Brittany) tombs of differing plan?undifferentiated as well as cruciform?were in contemporaneous use. Site 5, due to its position, must also be a monument of the same culture. The presence of Neolithic 'A5 pottery as opposed to Garrowkeel ware need not be taken as evidence for excluding it. The flint barbed-and-tanged arrowheads from Sites 2 were found in an unstratified position and as such cannot be used for dating purposes. Such arrowheads are normally considered as part of the beaker complex but recent work is beginning to show that barbed-and-tanged arrowheads may have been coming into use at an earlier date. Some examples have been found apparently in a primary position in passage graves; there is an example from Slieve Gullionand the Loughcrew Cairns U and R2 each produced a specimen (Collins and Wilson, 1963, 38, with references). At Sites 2, 3 and 4 the evidence indicates that the burials were cremations; at Site 4 both cremation and inhumation occurred. Because of the extension of the kerb across the entrances of Sites 2 and 3 it would be difficult to re-enter</page><page sequence="56">354 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. the tomb after placing the capstone in position. It may be that at least in those two tombs the rite was that of single collective burial. As yet chronological relationship between the 'satellite5 sites and the large tumulus is not clear. At first hand it might be thought that the earliest site constructed at Knowth was the large tumulus and afterwards the smaller sites were erected around its perimeter with their entrances facing it. Due to the irregularity in the plan of the kerb of Site 3 it could be argued that it was constructed after Sites 1 and 2, shoved into a small area between both sites and, in order to make it fit, the area enclosed had of necessity to be irregular. But such a sequence of construction cannot be accepted as readily as all that. On the plan (Pis. XVII, XXVIIIa) it can be seen that a slight kink occurs in the kerb of Site 1 when it approaches Site 3, suggesting that an attempt was made to avoid a pre-existing structure. Furthermore, it must also be recalled that the portion of the kerb of Site 3 closest to Site 1 is composed of small boulders set on top of a loose construction of small stones (PL XXIXa). This might indicate that part of the kerb of Site 3 was destroyed during the construction of Site 1 and that what now exists (Kerbs 18-24) is the result of an attempt at reconstruction. All this could mean that Site 1 may be a composite structure and its present extent could be the result of enlarge ment at a date after the construction of some of the small sites. Of course, due to the limited extent of the excavation so far carried out none of these problems can be solved, in fact it only indicates their existence. That the passage grave builders formed an ordered society is clear from the cemetery plan and grouping, from the intelligence shown in their art and from their constructional and architectural achievements as are dis played by the vastness of a number of the individual structures at Brugh na B?inne. But the excavations at Site 1 further emphasise their constructional abilities. There the strata were laid down in a regular manner and this must indicate that the tumulus was built as part of a single operation and not carried out in a casual or haphazard manner over a long period. This evidence points to the existence of a large population that was capable of producing surplus food and thus making possible the carrying out of large scale non-productive enterprises. Certainly, these people who built the tombs and buried their dead at Brugh na B?inne were not just small, disorganised material culture groups; on the contrary, the evidence points to the existence of centres of sedentary occupation. In any event, taking the constructional features of Knowth in conjunction with the cemetery in general, one may conclude that the passage grave builders represented a distinctive social system with a back ground that was urban or at least town-dwelling and metal-using (cf. Blance, 1961). Part H. The Secondary Features The second phase of activity at Knowth started during the 1st millennium A.D. at a time not yet precisely established but possibly not earlier than its second half. For the history of the site during the intervening millennia</page><page sequence="57">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 355 archaeology has not yet provided any clues. Early or Middle Bronze Age man may have come to Knowth, but the only evidence for this is provided by the discovery in 1714 of a stone vessel. This was found "in a mound at Knowth . . . enclosed in a square box about 5 ft (152-5 cms) long and 4 ft (122 cms) broad, made of four rude large flagstones set together edgeways". Obviously this structure was a cist and within the vessel were found "loose fragments of burnt bones'5 (Molyneux, 1726, p. 200). Ditches No. 1 (Pis. XVIII, XXIb). On the inside of the kerb of Site 1 and placed concentrically with it a deep ditch occurs. This has been dug into the subsoil (and in places penetrates the shale) for a maximum depth of 2*30 m. It averages 3 m in width at the top and 50-60 cms at the bottom. The sides slope inwards towards the base. On the whole the ditch has been dug in a uniform manner although in one or two instances (e.g. opposite kerb stones 3-5 and 27) there are irregularities both in the sides and in the base. It is clear that the ditch is secondary8. This is shown by strata of a similar kind occurring on the outside as well as on the inside of the ditch; at the back of the kerb stones a layer of cairn resting on a layer of redeposited sod corresponds to the lowermost layers of the mound on the inside of the ditch (e.g. Sections 15-16, Fig. 8; Strata 3 and 5). Again, on the inside of the ditch the strata of the mound have a fairly straight outer edge. If the ditch were an original feature the outer edge of the layers should appear quite irregular as the newly-built unconsolidated mound would weather rapidly. Therefore it would seem that the mound had consolidated before the ditch was cut. Furthermore, if the ditch were primary, and therefore a delimiting feature, it would be expected that the strata should thin at the edge of the ditch and not terminate abruptly. Indeed, the ditch appears to have been dug at some time long subsequent to the construction of the tumulus and the stony material now found outside the kerb may be upcast from the ditch when it was being constructed.9 Some of the fill of the ditch can be attributed to slip from the tumulus and in parts of the fill lumps of sod are found. These must have broken off from the edge of the mound under somewhat similar circumstances to those observed at the experimental earthwork at Overton Down, Wiltshire (Dimbleby, 1965, 134). No. 2 (Fig. 16; PL XVII). This ditch occurs between Sites 4 and 5 and Site 1 ; it runs in a south-west/north-east direction. It was dug into the sub soil for a maximum depth of 1-15 m and is over 3 m in width at the mouth. The fill consisted of dark earth with very few stones. The excavation was not carried sufficiently far inwards or outwards from Site 1 conclusively to 8 During the course of the excavation Prof. M. J. O'Kelly pointed out that the structure suggested to him the ditch of an Anglo-Norman mote. 9 There must also have been considerable primary slip immediately after construction but stratigraphically it has not been possible to identify it from the upcast.</page><page sequence="58">356 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. establish the absence of a bank but there are no surface indications. The purpose of this ditch and its date remain unknown. A surface depression indicates that it continues north-eastwards towards the road and on the south western side of Site 5 a low bank joins it at right angles (PL XIX).10 Drains (PL XVII) In the area excavated five drains were discovered. These average about 1'50 cms in maximum width and were dug into the subsoil for a depth of around 40 cms. All tend to run in a south to north direction. Drains 1 and 2 (running across Sites 2 and 3) started in Site 1 as they are found in the upcast (Section 1-2, Fig. 6) and, in addition, Drain 2 was carried over ?he tomb of Site 3 in the form of a stone-lined channel (Sections Figs. 6: 11-12, 7: C-D; Pis. XXVb, XXVIb). Drain 5 ran from the edge of Ditch 2. The purpose of these drains has not been established, but it may be suggested that some (e.g. 1 and 2) were dug to carry off water that could have been accumulating in the then near silted-up Ditch 1. The fact that portions of Drains 1 and 2 run through the upcast and that Drain 2 also runs across the tomb of Site 3 clearly establishes that they are not primary features. Similarly, the mound of Site 5 must have been lowered to the height it had immediately prior to archaeological excavation before Drain 5 had been dug, as upcast Fig. 32?Souterrain 1, plan and sections. 10The aerial photograph (PL XIX) also shows the existence of a secondary earthwork between Site 1 and the road. This area has not yet been investigated.</page><page sequence="59">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 357 from the drain was thrown up over portion of the surviving part of the mound. The problem of the chronological position between Drain 1 and Souterrain 2 is difficult. It would appear that the souterrain is the later of the two, as part of its chamber is in the line of the drain. If the drain were a later construction one might have expected that it would veer off to one side so as to avoid the souterrain or either that its builders would have removed the ob structing part of the chamber. Souterrains No. 1 (Fig. 32; PL LIVa). This is situated on the north-western side of Site 1. Before excavation there were no surface features visible. The structure is well-built and well preserved. In plan it consists of a passage, and an oval chamber. Both passage and chamber are formed by drystone walling. The stones used are quite small, only averaging about 20 cms in length by 10 cms in height. Apart from a slight bulge on the south-west side at the centre, the passage walls are almost parallel-sided while in section they are vertical. The passage is roofed by five capstones (including the kerb stones of Site 1 ) and where these do not touch or overlap the intervening area is bridged by small stones. In ground plan the chamber measures 2-00 m by 1-70 m internally. The beehive shaped corbelled roof rises to a height of 1 *50 m and is finished off on the top by a large capstone. The souterrain is aligned north-west/south-east and the entrance is on the north-western side. Kerb stone No. 32 of Site 1 forms the lintel stone of the entrance and the souterrain itself is built within the kerb. The entrance consists of a pit that was dug into the subsoil to a sufficient depth to allow passage under the kerb stone without undue hindrance. The approach to the entrance pit is at right angles to the entrance itself. On the other sides, on the old ground surface, there is a setting of stones around the cage of the pit. If the material on the outside of the kerb is upcast from the ditch (p. 355) then a pit must also have been dug through this to allow access to the entrance. The pit noted during the excavation (Fig. 32) is hardly original, but one dug by Macalister to expose the face of kerb No. 32. From the entrance the floor of the souterrain slopes downwards gradually to the back of the chamber. Over the floor there was a thin layer of sticky, silt-like material. No finds came to light. As the chamber and most of the passage is constructed in Ditch 1 (see p. 355 above) it is clear that not only was the souterrain built after the digging of the ditch, but after the ditch had filled up. No. 2 (Fig. 33; PL LIVb). This occurs at the north-eastern side of Site 2 and, like Souterrain No. 1, there were no surface indications visible before excavation ; the structure came to light during the excavation of the megalith. The souterrain, which was well made, remained in a good state of preservation, and in plan it is similar to No. 1. Its long axis runs approximately east/west</page><page sequence="60">358 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. with the chamber at the eastern end. The passage is straight; it is 3-20 m long and averages 65 cms in width. Structurally it consists of a cutting in the subsoil, the edges of which were lined with dry-stone walling. The southern wall is straight but the northern wall has a central inward bulge. The sides are vertical and are about 60 to 70 cms in height. The roofing of the passage consists of five lintels ; intervening spaces between these are filled with smaller, irregularly-shaped stones. From the entrance the floor of the passage deepens and slopes downwards to the chamber. The chamber is circular; its average measurements are 1*80 m in diameter and about 1 -30 m in height, and it is constructed of dry-stone walling. The stones of the bottom layer are the largest. Placed upright in an almost vertical position they average 40 cms in height. Above these the courses project inwards to form a corbelled roof that is finished off at the top by two capstones. At the entrance, and for a short distance in from it, the passage was filled to the top ; the remainder of the passage and the chamber were filled to about three-quarters of their height. The fill was uniform and consisted of dark soft earth with a mixture of stones. Some charcoal which was found was identified by Miss Scannell as Alnus (alder) and Quercus (oak). Finds A number of animal bones were found in the fill of the passage and chamber. Amongst these Miss G. Roche (National Museum of Ireland) has</page><page sequence="61">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 35? identified the remains of ox, sheep, rabbit, cats and an unborn calf. Three of the bones show evidence of use. These are somewhat similar in shape and each has a central longitudinal perforation. No. 1 (Fig. 38: 1) made from the proximal end of the metacarpal of a horse, is the best preserved. No. 2 (Fig. 38: 2) is made from a similar bone, but it is now in a damaged state. No. 3 (Fig. 38: 3), also incomplete, is probably the radius of an ox or horse. A flatfish circular stone object with hollow on one side (Fig. 38: 4) was found at the entrance just below the top of the fill. This object resembles a lamp (cf. that discovered in Newgrange td. J.R.S.A.I., 94 (1964), 97, Fig. 3), but no traces of burning now remain. In plan both Souterrains 1 and 2 resemble a souterrain discovered during Professor Macalister's excavations (Roe in Macalister, 1943, 141-49, Fig. 14) but the chamber of the latter structure is larger. Hearths No. 1 (PL XVIII). This hearth, which was situated on the northern edge of Site 1, consisted of an area of 60 cms in length by 30 cms in maximum width. It was bounded on three sides by small stones set on edge; the fourth side (the south-eastern) was open. Outside the hearth, on the south-western side, a few loose stones lay. The hearth was 90 cms below the present surface and 1 m above the outer edge of Ditch 1, and is therefore of later date than the ditch. Indeed the ditch must have filled up considerably before the hearth was constructed, but the layers of ash extending inwards from it (Fig. 6; Section 11-12) show that a dip existed. In fact, this dip was used as a habita tion site. This is shown not only by the presence of the hearth itself and its adjoining ash layers, but also by the presence of occupation refuse in the form of dark earth that had a mixture of ash, charcoal and scraps of bone. Evidence for occupation extended along the ditch for about 4 m to the east of the hearth and 1 m to the west of it. The hearth was placed on the outer edge of the habitation area which extended inwards from it for a distance of about 3 m. Finds All the following objects were associated, as far as it was possible to determine, with the occupation material. Buckle (Fig. 34: 1 ;PL LX). This object has been examined by Dr. Fran?oise Henry, who reports that it "is made from bronze, probably gilt. Very fine casting. On one side there are the remains of the two loops of a hinge which held the tongue. On the opposite side a flattened and enlarged part of the ring provided a resting surface for the tongue. The analogy in shape is fairly close with the working part of the enamelled buckle from Lough Gara in the National Museum of Ireland (J.R.SA.L, 90 (1960), 37-38) and the fact that the hinge-loops are flat on the decorated side of the buckle may indicate that the tongue had, like that of the Lough Gara buckle, a flat decorated plaque covering the hinge and resting on it.</page><page sequence="62">360 Proceedings of the koyal Irish Academy. 2 CM.

Meath, 1962-65. 361 The decoration is very worn, but it is possible to see that it included two opposed bird heads (perhaps indeed four) and two sunken panels decorated with interlacings. The general disposition of the decoration with two opposed bird heads is similar to that of the buckle of the Moylough belt, though in this last case the buckle is an imitation with no practical purpose. Oblong rings with two opposed animal heads are also found on several objects in the National Museum of Ireland (See C.A.A.I., Vol. I, PL 50; 3, 6), though none of them could have been buckles, but are simply attachment plaques of a hinge. From these comparisons, a date in the late seventh to eighth century is likely". Pin (Fig. 34: 4). Bronze. Head is dome-shaped. It is corroded but appears to be divided into four quadrants by grooves. On the under side of the head there is a series of dots. Extending down the shank for a distance of 12 mm there are three longitudinal rows of punched dots. A lightly incised line is discernible between each of these. Pins of this type appear to have had a long life, extending from the Early Christian period into the medieval period. Iron knife (Fig. 34: 2). This is one-edged and tanged. The back is slightly convex. In places the surface has been corroded. Also, part of the blade of an iron knife (Fig. 34: 3). This is much corroded but it appears to have been part of a knife similar to that just described. (The use of knives of this type in Ireland extended from the Iron Age to medieval times.) Iron pin (Fig. 34: 5). This has a slightly expanded head (now damaged) and bent shank. Bone pin (Fig. 34: 6) made from the tine of a red deer. The surface has been well polished. Four bone objects (Fig. 34: 7-10). The surface of these has been smoothed and all taper towards a tip. Only one example is complete (No. 7) and this has a well-fashioned point. This object is made from a splinter of the right ulna of an ox. No. 8 is a splint bone of a horse, No. 9 is the proximal end of the right ulna of a calf and No. 10 comes from the right ulna of a sheep. Flint scraper (Fig. 34: 11) made from honey-coloured flint. It has a distinctive medial ridge and some secondary working around the edge. Short thumb-shaped flint scraper (Fig. 34: 12) made of the snapped-off end of a blade. The nose is fairly steep. Hearth 1 was the focal point of a small occupation area, but in the absence of any evidence for houses the occupation may have been seasonal. The following four hearths are situated in Site 4: No. 2 (Fig. 11 ; PL XXXIIa). This was a depression 2-90 m long by 1 -50 m wide. The sides and the bottom were very red and indicated that a fire, or fires, had been kept burning for a very long time. At the western end a slight ridge ran transversely across the hearth and the portion to the west of this ridge was the deepest. Over most of the bottom of the pit there was a crust of hard material, perhaps the mound material altered by the intense heat. The fill</page><page sequence="64">362 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. consisted of dark, loose earth and stones, some of which showed evidence of having been in contact with heat. At the bottom there was a layer of ash that varied in thickness from 2*5 cms to 5 cms. No. 3 (Fig. 11; PL XXXIIb). This showed up as a depression 1-90 m long and 1 m wide. It was shallower than Hearth 2 and the fires lighted in it were much less intense than those that burned in Hearth 2. Nearby there was a scatter of burnt earth which could have been thrown out from the hearth. Neither of the hearths produced charcoal. (Fig. 11; PL XXXII). Hearths 2 and 3 were linked to each other by means of a double stone setting formed by stones that averaged 40 cms in height. This was semi-circular in shape and the distance between the rows remained constant throughout. The shorter (southern) setting consisted of six stones and the larger setting of eight stones, but at about mid-point of this there is a considerable gap. At the western end the settings ran along the edge of Hearth 2 for a short distance but the end stones show no evidence of having been in contact with heat. No. 4 (Fig. 11; PL XXXIIIb). This hearth, lying on the surface of the subsoil, was almost entirely surrounded by a stone setting. There was evidence of slight burning, and around it there was a considerable scatter of char coal. Miss Scannell reports that this consisted of Quercus (oak), Cory lus (hazel) and Salix-Populus (willow-poplar). No. 5 (Fig. 11 ; PL XXXI Va) consisted of a pit 43 cms in maximum depth and roughly circular at the top, where it was about 1 m in diameter. The base showed considerable burning. Hearths 4 and 5 were connected to each other by means of a shallow channel. At a couple of points the channel had stones delimiting its edges. Fires do not appear to have been lighted in the channel but there was a scatter of charcoal. It can be shown that Hearths 2 and 3 and the double stone setting are secondary, because parts of the setting and Hearth 3 extended over the cairn with about 12 cms of earth intervening between the top of the cairn and the base of the setting (PL XXXIIIa). In other words the setting and hearths were placed high up in the mound. Furthermore, at other points it was clear that the setting had been inserted into the mound (Figs. 12-13; Sections E-F, and M-N). It is also clear that Hearth 4 is secondary, as its construction caused the destruction of part of the cairn that surrounded the tomb. Precisely when Hearths 2-5 were constructed has not been established; but if the burnt earth is material that was thrown out from Hearth 3 then the construction of that hearth, at least, must have taken place at a time subse quent to the destruction of the tomb. As this material was found above sockets 6-7 it could only have been deposited there after the removal or destruction of the orthostats that stood in these sockets. Apart from Hearth 1 which, as has been shown, was associated with occupation, it is not clear what function the other hearths served. They may,</page><page sequence="65">Bogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 363 however, have served a purpose other than domestic. Indeed, in structure Hearths 4-5 resemble the corn-drying oven, seemingly of Roman date, dis covered by Rahtz at Bokerly Dyke, Dorset (Rahtz, 1961, p. 84, Fig. 8). Fireplaces This name is being applied to any place where a fire had been kept burning for some time but where there are no structural features such as a stone setting. No. 1 (Fig. 2). This was a primary feature and it has been already described (p. 308). No. 2 (PL XVIII). This was on the old surface outside kerb stone No. 26 of Site 1. It covered an area 1 m by 75 cms and, from the amount of charcoal and evidence for burning, a fire or fires must have been kept burning on the place for a considerable time. There were also animal bones present and amongst these Miss Roche has identified ox, pig and sheep. The fragments of the bone comb described on p. 375 were found amongst the debris. Nos. 3-5 (Fig. 15). On Site 5 three places where fires were kept burning were discovered but in each instance the fire or fires had not been of great intensity. The precise date of these three fireplaces has not been established. Pits No. 1 (Fig. 2). This pit, a primary feature at Site 2, has already been described (p. 308). No. 2 (Fig. 11). This was dug at the back of kerb stone No. 1 of Site 4 and it pierced the sub-soil to a depth of 70 cms. At one point it extended to the double stone setting. It is conceivable that the gap in the setting may be due to the activities of those who dug the pit. The fill consisted mainly of loose stones, some of which were shattered and angular. Somewhat similar stones were scattered over the area between Sites 4 and 5. No. 3 (Fig. 15). This was found in the centre of Site 5. It has rounded ends and was 1 -86 m in maximum length by 92 cms in maximum width. It was dug into the subsoil to a maximum depth of 40 cms. The fill consisted of dark earth and this produced some animal bones amongst which ox and horse (identification by Miss Roche) are represented ; but as a result of their general appearance, their lack of bleaching and other features, Dr. Jackson (National Museum of Ireland) in a personal communication has stated his belief that they are of fairly recent date. If this is so the pit must be a secondary feature. No. 4 (Fig. 15). Along the south-west side of Site 5 part of a pit and a stone, 40 cms in height, turned up. PROG. R.I.A., VOL. 66, SECT. C.

Meath, 1962-65. 365 "Gobbled" Layer (PL XVII) This occurs on Site 2 on the north-eastern side of Drain 1. Stones giving a sort of cobbled effect were placed on top of the old ground surface. Their purpose is not clear, but they may be secondary. Burials The areas investigated produced five secondary burials. These were inhumations. Burials 1 and 2 were those of children, 3-5, adults. In no instance were the burials protected in any way. Grave-goods accompanied Burials 1-3. No. 1 (Fig. 35; PI LVa). This burial was discovered at a depth of 60 cms below the present surface. The remains were placed in a pit dug into the mound of Site 3.11. The burial contained the grave of a complete human skeleton in a relatively good state of preservation and placed in a north-west/south-east position with the skull on the north-west. The body was flexed. The trunk and pelvis lay to the east of the skull almost horizontal in both planes but with a slight inclination to the right side. The skull and neck were contorted, producing a chin-on-chest attitude due to full forward flexion of the cervical vertebrae ; the skull was also turned 50 ? to the right of the midline so that the point of the chin lay over the middle one-third of the right clavicle. The left upper limb was placed so that the left forearm lay across the chest. No remains of the left hand were found during excavation although those of the right hand were perfectly preserved. (The distal ends of the left radius and ulna were too poorly preserved to establish how the hand came to be missing.) The right upper arm was so placed that the hand occupied a position on a level with the skull and a few centimetres to the right of it. This attitude was achieved by slight abduction of the arm, almost full flexion of the elbow joint9 supination of the forearm and partial flexion of the wrist. Both thighs were drawn up to make a right angle with the trunk and the knees were displaced about 25 cms to the right of the midline. The knee joints were both flexed, placing the feet to the left of the mid-fine on a level with the pelvis. The positions of the legs and arms were obviously intentional but the unusual position of the skull may have resulted from subsidence of the remains within the pit. All the joint surfaces were in articulation indicating that the burial was that of an entire body and not just a haphazard deposit of bones. Dr. Blanche Weekes reports that these "are the bones of a child of about six years; there are unerupted milk teeth in the upper and lower jaws while the first permanent molar appears to have erupted in the lower jaw. The sex is probably female because the upper part of the sciatic foramen appears to have a female curvature". 11 For assistance with the secondary burials in the field I am especially grateful to Mr. John Bradshaw.</page><page sequence="68">366 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.

The skeleton was accompanied by three objects: Tip of horn (Fig. 37: la; PL LVIIb). This object, which was/ound at the right elbow, tapers to a point from a diameter of 20 mm at the other end. Approximately the upper half is hollow to form a socket; the remainder is solid. Portion of the wall has been broken away around the mouth and on one side the remains of a perforation, 8*5 mm in diameter, survives. Three bands of ornament encircle the wider end of the object and each of these bands is bounded by an incised transverse line. In the upper and middle band the ornamental scheme consists of zig-zag lines. Each alternative triangle has slight pecking over its surface. In the band of ornament nearest the tip, the basic element is again the zig-zag. As in the other bands, alternate triangles are pecked and these are outlined by two, or in some cases three lines. The purpose of this object is unknown. Due to the size of the socket it is unlikely that it served as a handle for, say, a knife as at Lagore (Hencken, 1950, Fig. 44b) or a punch as from Grave 1153 at Birka, Sweden (Arbman, 1943, p. 477, Taf. 154: 1). The perforation may indicate that it was a pendant of some sort. Two conical stone objects (Fig. 37: Ib-c; PL L VII la). These were found between the upper part of the body and the right arm of the skeleton. No. lb is 26 mm in diameter at the base and it is 38 mm in height. The extreme tip has been broken off. The entire surface has been well smoothed down. The object has been examined by Dr. Jackson and he thinks that it was fashioned from a fine-grained chloritic volcanic ash. No. lc is made from shale but part of it has split. The object is now 30 mm in diameter at the base and 47 mm in height. These objects may have been used as gaming pieces.

The remains are not well preserved but Dr. Weekes has identified them as "the bones of a child, probably of the same age as Burial 1, that is about 6 years. The sex is the same as that of Burial 1, therefore probably female." The following is a key to the numbering on Fig. 35 : 1. Left femur. 7. Right hum?rus. 2. Right femur. 8. Left hand. 3. Right tibia. 9. Left hum?rus. 4. Left tibia 10. Right ulna. 5. Right fibula. 11. Right radius. 6. Left fibula. 12. Pelvis. Burial 2 was accompanied by two groups of grave goods; one group probably represents a necklace, the other a bracelet or armlet. The Necklace (PL LIX). A total of 285 beads was recovered. Of this number 283 are small but in this category two main sizes occur. With one exception, beads of the larger size are made from blue glass; they are tubular in shape and average 2 mm in width. There are 126 tiny beads and these average 1 mm in length by 2 mm in diameter. Ninety-nine examples are blue glass; the remaining twenty-seven are amber-coloured. All the small beads were found around the breast of the skeleton. There are two large beads. The larger came from the front of the body and might have been a spacer bead occupying a central position in the neck lace. This bead, 13 mm long, is made from bone. It has rounded ends, an off-centre perforation and a deep groove around the body. The nearest parallels to this bead seem to be the dumb-bell beads that are known from Early Christian sites like Lagore (Hencken, 1950, 141). There is also a super ficial resemblance between the Knowth bead and segmented beads which also occur in Early Christian contexts in Ireland and in Viking sites in Scandi navia (for instance, as part of the necklace from Grave 854 in Birka mentioned below, p. 368). There is, of course, a considerable difference between the Knowth and the segmented beads, for the former is perforated transversely, the latter longitudinally. The second large Knowth bead, which is smaller, is about 6 mm in diameter, is spherical and made from greyish glass. The perforation is centrally placed. This bead was found at the back of the neck and it may have been associated with the joint or clasp of the necklace at that point. Beads and Rings (Fig. 37: 2; PL LIX). This was found at the left hand of the skeleton and it consists of five beads and five rings. None of the rings was found on any finger; but the hand was in a very fragmented state. It may be that with the addition of now decayed organic material the beads and rings combined to form a bracelet,</page><page sequence="70">368 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. The beads are made from organic material, most likely of bone, as Dr. Jackson points out. They have a smooth, glossy surface and in places have been stained greenish in colour through contact with the metal rings. They are spherical in shape, with the largest example 10 mm in maximum diameter. From that dimension the other examples grade downwards in size to a maxi mum diameter of 7-5 mm. Each bead is perforated and this dips downwards in the centre. These beads are similar to those from Burial 3. The five rings are made from bronze or copper. They are penannular and in all cases the ends are closely set to each other. All have a green patina tion. Three of the rings are segmented. No. 2a is 18 mm in diameter and 2-5 mm thick; No. 2b is 16*5 mm in diameter and 2 mm thick; No. 2c is 14-5 mm in diameter and 2 mm thick. The larger of the plain rings (No. 2d) is 16 mm in diameter, the smaller (No. 2e) 15 mm. Both are 1*5 mm thick. These bronze rings have counterparts in the silver rings (some of which formed part of a necklace) that accompanied an inhumation burial in Grave 854 in the Viking cemetery at Birka, Sweden (Arbman, 1943, 326, Abb. 275: 2 o ; Taf. 112: 7 : also Taf. 118). It may also be recalled that milling sometimes occurs on the rings of ring-headed pins such as those found, for instance, at Lagore (Hencken, 1950, p. 72, Fig. 14; 216, 635). No. 3 (Fig. 35: PL LVIa). This crouched burial was discovered at the northern side of Site 3 at a depth of 60 cms below the present surface. It was placed in a small, shallow, circular pit. The remains were in an exceedingly poor state of preservation and those bones that were not already shattered broke on the slightest touch, thus rendering their intact removal impossible. In addition, portion of the skeleton below the thoracic region had decayed and the sternum, clavicle and one scapula were absent. The skull was com pletely shattered but the upper and lower parts of the jaw remained in situ The hands were incomplete. The skeleton had apparently been placed on its right side with the head placed on the side. The forearms were bent backwards with the left hand under the side of the head while the remains of the right hand were found in position about 5 cms in front of the face. Of the right arm the hum?rus was complete and the olecranon fossa was clearly defined ; the radius and ulna were incomplete. The remains of a few phalanges were found pointing towards the left hand. None of the bones of the left arm was complete, part of the hum?rus and portions of two bones that lay underneath were all that remained. The olecranon fossa was partly destroyed. The ends of the left radius and ulna were separated from the hum?rus and were lying with their broken ends resting on the right hum?rus. The right hum?rus was in contact with its radius and ulna. Bones of the left hand remained, but whether these were carp?is or metacarpals was not clear. Parts of the clavicle, scapula and spinal column were found. Only the stumps of four ribs on the left side remained, on the right side the badly broken remains of six ribs survived,</page><page sequence="71">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 369 Reporting on the bones Dr. Weekes states that "they are very fragmented, the fragment containing the midline portion of upper and lower jaws appears to be that of an adult". The following is a key to the numbering on Fig. 35 : 1. Right ulna. 7. Clavicle. 2. Right radius. 8. Left hum?rus. 3. Left ulna. 9. Right fingers. 4. Left radius 10. Left fingers. 5. Right hum?rus. II. Jaws. 6. Scapula. 12. Right ribs. 13. Left ribs. Six bone beads (Fig. 37; PL LVIIIb) accompanied the skeleton and as these were found around the neck they must have formed part of a necklace. Four of these (A-D) are approximately similar both in size (10*5 mm in width) and in shape. In shape they are somewhat spheroid, but there is at one point a slight projection of the otherwise regular plane and through this area a perforation in the centre is found. e is smaller than the previous examples (7-5 mm in diameter) and the perforation penetrates the body of the bead nearer towards the centre, f, which is the smallest bead of the group, and is 5 mm long by 6 mm in width, has a perforation through the centre. The closest parallels for these beads are provided by five bone beads from Burial 2 and both groups of beads can themselves be paralleled in the four bone beads which were found together with a bone ring in a grave at Newgrange (Flanagan, 1960). Unfortunately, this does not provide any additional evidence for dating; but the Newgrange grave must, like those at Knowth, be secondary. The bone ring might correspond to the bronze rings from Burial 2. In their publication of material from the Viking cemetery at Islandbridge, Dublin, Coffey and Armstrong (1910, p. 120) record that "a number of small wooden beads covered with glass, joined together in straight length of four and five" were found. No. 4 (Fig. 36; PL LVIb). This burial was found at a depth of 50 cms below the surface between Sites 4 and 5. The remains, which lay on a scatter of broken stones, consisted of bones from both lower and upper limbs, the pelvis, part of three vertebrae, two unidentified bones (possibly ribs), and part of a scapula which was found between two of the kerb stones. Thirty teeth were also found. These were scattered over an area centred on a point 30 cms to the south-west of the skeleton. From the surviving remains it appears that the body was buried in a crouched position, placed on its left side, with both knees sharply flexed and drawn up. The right knee was drawn higher than the left and it lay over the left forearm. From the position of the scapula and teeth it is evident that the upper part of the trunk and head were buried parallel to the</page><page sequence="72">370 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. setting of kerb stones while the rest of the trunk and pelvis lay at right angles to that setting. No traces of hands, feet, kneecaps, thorax or vertebrae were found. The greater portion of the rib cage was also missing. The absence of these bones, as well as other evidence, would seem to indicate that considerable disturbance of the remains took place subsequent to burial. However, the presence of the teeth and scapula and also some minute fragments of bone from near to where the skull would have been placed, seems to establish beyond reasonable doubt that when originally buried the body was entire. Dr. Weekes reports that the "bones appear to be those of a male, judging by the shape of the upper part of the great sciatic notch. The teeth are in much better condition than those of Burial 5 and, therefore, perhaps he was younger than the woman of Burial 5." Key to bones shown on plan (Fig. 36) : 1. Right tibia. 8. Pelvis. 2. Right fibula. 9. Vertebrae. 3. Left femur. 10. Right radius and ulna. 4. Left tibia. 11. Unidentified. 5. Left ulna. 12. Right hum?rus. 6. Left hum?rus. 13. Probably a right ulna below the upper end. 7. Right femur. 14. Ribs. 15. Teeth. Also found, but not shown on plan, were left fibula (under left tibia), left radius (beneath left ulna) and scapula (between kerb stones 9 and 10). No. 5 (Fig. 36; PL LVIIa). The remains, which were found about 1 m below the surface, were those of a nearly complete skeleton of a person about 1-57 m (5 ft 2 in) in height. The body was placed on its back in an almost fully extended position and in a south-west/north-east line. The skull was turned sharply to the right. The forearm portion was turned up wards and backwards towards the head. The left arm was extended by the side. All the vertebrae appeared to have been present but they were in a very decayed state. The right femur was inserted into the right acetabulum where it was flexed so that its distal end lay over the distal end of the left femur. The left femur was inserted into the left acetabulum and it was in a straight extended position. The right leg bones were poorly preserved and the distal ends had decayed. The left tibia and fibula were present but damaged, as were also the feet. Dr. Weekes thinks that the bones may be "those of a female, small in stature, and of about middle age. The part of the great sciatic notch in the pelvis which is present appears to be the width that would be expected from a female subject. The jaw is that of an adult, but not an old person. The teeth are decayed and worn; to what extent this is due to diet is uncertain?"</page><page sequence="73">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co.

Discussion The presence of objects accompanying Burials 1-3 should indicate that these are the remains of pagan rather than of Christian persons. For compara tive purposes the best evidence is provided by the "gaming" pieces from Burial 1 and the bronze rings from Burial 2 as the closest external parallels for these in combination seem to come from Viking burials at Birka. The Birka burials, of course, contain objects that have originated in a wide area of Europe and even if the comparisons are valid this does not necessarily indicate a Viking</page><page sequence="74">s* &amp;X3 o ve S &gt; s 2 Vi</page><page sequence="75">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 373 origin for the Knowth pieces. However, the analogies show that objects closely resembling the Knowth rings and "gaming pieces" were being deposited in graves in Sweden during the 9th or 10th centuries A.D. As the bone beads from Burial 3 (and also from the Newgrange grave) are similar to those associated with the bronze rings in Burial 2, Burial 3 must also be contemporary. Perhaps it may yet be shown conclusively that these three burials should be added to the other Viking graves already known from Ireland (Shetelig, 1945, 1 ff.). Because of the absence of grave goods it is not possible to establish if Burials 4 and 5 are contemporary with Burials 1-3. It can only definitely be stated that these burials also post-date the megalithic structures. Burial 4 was placed on stones that were thrown down haphazardly between Sites 4 and 5 and as Burial 5 rested on the lip of Ditch 2 it must be later than the construc tion of that feature. Miscellaneous Finds Tip of the shank of bronze pin (Fig. 38: 5). It is 72 mm long and circular in cross-section, and tapers to the point from a diameter of 3*5 mm at the fracture. Found on Site 1 in the fill of Ditch 1, 3 m on the inside of kerb stone No. 27 at a depth of 1*75 m below the surface. Iron ring-headed pin (Fig. 38: 6). Damaged due to corrosion, but as far as can be determined the head is not folded over but has been perforated to take the ring. The stem is 67 mm long. The ring, 10 mm in diameter, is penannular; originally the ends were most likely set close to each other as is the case in other examples of pins of this type. Found at a depth of 35 cms in soft dark earth, 2-50 m to west of kerb stone 29 of Site 3. Ring pins in both bronze and iron are frequently found on occupation sites of the Early Christian period in Ireland such as Carrig Aille, Co. Limerick (? R?ord?in, 1949, 74), or Garryduff, Co. Cork (O'Kelly, 1962, 50). Iron knife (Fig. 38: 7). This is one-edged and is 94 mm in length. It is cor roded by rust and the tip is missing. The tang, 26 mm long, projects out of the butt at about midpoint. Found in disturbed material at the base of the humus just west of orthostat 5 of the tomb of Site 1. Part of mouthpiece from iron horse-bit (Fig. 38: 8). The head is crooked and touches the shank. The head is rectangular in cross-section but the body tends to be oval. The other end is bent. Discovered in upcast on the outside of kerb stone No. 30 of Site 1. Iron object (Fig. 38: 9). Poorly preserved and the surface much corroded. Originally the object had four "arms" but one of these has been broken off and the end of another is missing. Each complete arm ends in a knob. Bone Combs.

Meat h, 1962-65. 375 No. 1 (Fig. 38: 11). Part of a one-sided comb made in the usual manner from a bone plaque into which the teeth are cut. Along the body of the plaque there are two horizontal plates of D-shaped cross-section. These are held in place by an iron and a bone rivet. Each plate is decorated with a herring-bone pattern flanked at each end by transverse grooves. On the inside of the iron rivet there is a dot-and-circle motif. Nicks at the edges of the plates show that they were in position before the teeth were cut, a normal feature on combs of the Early Christian period in Ireland. No. 2 (Fig. 38: 10). Also part of a one-sided comb. Only a small end portion of the body survives ; but as this has different features, such as more pronounced bevelling along the outside edge, it does not appear to have been the other end of No. 1. One iron rivet survives. No. 3 (Fig. 38: 10). This is a small fragment of a body plate but as this piece has ornament in the form of a dot and circle it hardly belongs to No. 1. If No. 2 represents a separate comb then it may have been part of the body plate of that comb and occupied a position approximate to that shown in the illustration (Fig. 38: 10). Dot-and-circle ornament is frequently found on Early Christian combs such as those from Ballinderry No. 2 (Hencken, 1942, 53). All the foregoing pieces were discovered together in dark earth just above the stone layer (5) on the inside of kerb No. 28 of Site 1. No. 4 (Fig. 38: 12). Fragments of the horizontal body plate. The decora tion consists of a series of double transverse lines and double oblique lines that leave the reserve areas in the shape of lozenges. Nicks in one fragment show that the plates were in position before the teeth were cut. Found at the base of Fireplace No. 2. The simple geometric ornament has a good parallel in the decoration found on the binding plates of a two-sided comb from Ballinderry No. 1, Co. Westmeath (Hencken, 1936, 163-4, No. 1, Fig. 30D). Bone Object (Fig. 38: 13). Polished with a crude point at one end. Made from the shaft of a right tibia of a sheep. Found in dark fill at a depth of 40 cms 1 m to east of kerb stone No. 20 of Site 2. Pottery Sherd (Fig. 38: 14). This has been identified by Dr. George Boon, National Museum of Wales, as a sherd of a Terra Sigillata bowl, Form 37 in the Dragendorff classification (Dragendorff, 1895-96; see also Oswald and Pryce, 1920, 95 ff.). The bowl is of Central Gaulish manufacture and of Antonine date (cf. Stanfield and Simpson, 1958, PL 168: 18). Found on the old surface at the base of the upcast on the outside of the kerb of Site 1, 2-10 m out from kerb stone No. 22. Glass Beads No. 1 (Melon Bead) (Fig. 38: 15). Made from bluish glass; its surface is now slightly corroded. Found in stony disturbed material on the west side of socket 5 of the tomb of Site 2.</page><page sequence="78">376 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. A number of melon beads are already known from Ireland. These have turned up on occupation sites of the Early Christian period such as Garranes, Ballinderry No. 2 and Lagore (? R?ord?in, 1942, 116; Hencken, 1942, 51 and 1950, 136). As Hencken has already stated, melon beads have had a long life and a wide distribution in Europe. They were already known during pre-Roman times, and were in use during the Roman period; but they re mained in vogue long after the fall of the Empire, especially in western and north-western Europe amongst the Germanic peoples. Later they are found in Viking contexts as for instance, at Birka in Sweden where in Grave 854 such a bead formed part of a necklace (Arbman, 1943, 327 with Abb. 275 andTaf. 118). Melon beads may have originated in the East Mediterannean area. In Egypt and Palestine melon beads were current from at least as early as the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. (cf. Tufnell, Inge and Harding, Lachish II {Tell ed Duweir): The Fosse Temple (Oxford, 1940), PL XXXV: 50, 54, 55; Beck, Archaeologia, 77 (1927), 10, Fig, 11). No. 2 (Fig. 38: 16). Made from dark glass. It is 10*5 mm in diameter. As wear is confined to one side of the perforation only, the object must have formed part of a necklace. An accurate date for it cannot be given. Found on the old ground surface near the centre of Site 5. No. 3 (Fig. 38: 17). Only half of this bead survives: it has a central perforation and was circular in shape. The material is blue glass. Found on the outside of kerb stone No. 5 of Site 6 at a depth of 25 cms. Medieval Pottery (Fig. 39: 1-10) All sherds were found in, or a short distance below, the sod. They have been examined by Mr. D. M. Waterman (Archaeological Survey of N. Ireland) who has shown that three types of vessel are represented. Jugs Three rim sherds (two illustrated Fig. 39: 1, 2); two parts of four strap handles (Fig. 39: 3, 4); one neck sherd (Fig. 39: 5); body sherds (cf. Fig. 39: 6); part of a foot ring (Fig. 39: 7). Skillets Three rim sherds (one illustrated, Fig. 39: 8) and a handle that has a characteristic curved end (Fig. 39: 9). Cooking pot One rim sherd (Fig. 39: 10). Mr. Waterman would date the group to the second half of the thirteenth century or the early fourteenth century. Rotary Quern. (PL XLI) Examined by Mr. S?amus Caulfield (Rathcoffey, Co. Kildare) who reports?"Lower stone only with approximately a quarter of edge absent due to breakage. The diameter is 56 cms. The thickness varies from 4 cms at the outer edge to 6-5 cms at the centre. Spindle hole is a com plete perforation varying from 3-5 cms on the upper (grinding) surface to 6*5 cms on the under surface. It is not exactly in the centre of the stone. The grinding surface is concave. This stone with its completely perforated spindle hole and concave grinding surface is typical of the majority of lower stones which show little</page><page sequence="79">?ogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co.

Contrary to what Curwen (Antiquity XI (1937), 144) suggests the complete perforation of the stone has no chronological or functional significance. The Knowth stone, with a diameter of 56 cms, is one of the largest in the Irish quern series. In general, large querns date to the second rather than to the first millennium A.D. However, quern stones exceeding 50 cms in diameter have been found in Early Christian contexts as the occurrence of examples in the crannog sites at Ballinderry No. 2 (Hencken, P.R.I.A., 47 C (1942), 32-33, PL XI, Fig. 2) and Lagore (Hencken, P.R.I.A., 53 C (1950), 173-75, quern recorded but not described in detail) show." Found on Site 1, 4 m on the inside of kerb stone No. 25 in the upper fill of Ditch 1 at a depth of 80 cms.</page><page sequence="80">378 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. GENERAL DISCUSSION As yet it is not possible to date any of the secondary features accurately and pending further investigation their chronological position and use can only be reviewed in a speculative manner. No firm conclusions can be reached ; but at least a clearer picture of the nature of the problems awaiting solution has emerged as has the trend that future research should take. No doubt this will modify, consolidate or cause the rejection of dates and theories now put forward. The cist burial hints at activity during the Early or Middle Bronze Age but it was not until the Early Christian period that the site again came into prominence. The single sherd of Terra Sigillata could have been dropped on the site as early as the second century B.C. but this in itself does not provide evidence of occupation. For some of the structures a certain relative chronology can be established. If the material on the outside of the kerb is upcast from Ditch 1 then Fireplace 2 (with its associated fragments of a bone comb of Early Christian date) which was sealed beneath it must have been in use before the portion of the ditch opposite it was dug. It has also been shown that Souterrain 1 is later than Ditch 1. The bulk of the secondary finds, including those from the burials, can be paralleled in Irish Early Christian or equivalent contexts and although it is difficult to be more specific, the evidence at our disposal points to the later phases of that period. If the buckle is not just a stray intrusive find deposited at a date much later than the period of its manufacture, then Hearth 1 and its associated occupation should date to the seventh or eight century A.D. The position of the occupation (Fig. 6, sections 11-12) indicates that this is stratigraphically later than the digging of Ditch 1, but in the absence of corroborating evidence the question regarding the precise time when Ditch 1 was dug must be left open. Some help may be derived from historical sources, but again it has not been established that the place referred to in the Annals and other sources is in fact the tumulus; there are other earthworks in Knowth townland. As Professor Byrne shows, the kings of Northern Brega are often styled kings of Cnodba (Knowth) but it appears that this title only came into use shortly before 800 A.D. The title was seemingly used down to the twelfth century, as during the first half of that century Hua Dondghaile is referred to as toiseach tuaithi Cnogba. It does seem that the terms King of Northern Brega and King of Knowth were interchangeable (as was the case with Southern Brega and Lagore) and the most likely explanation for this is that the kings of Northern Brega lived at Knowth. If Burials 1-3 are Viking it is difficult to explain their occurrence on the site of what may have been an Irish royal residence. Formal burial even hints at occupation and furthermore two of the burials are those of children. Professor Byrne has found no evidence that would indicate that Knowth was at any time in Viking hands and the often quoted entry in the Annals that</page><page sequence="81">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 379 Knowth was plundered around 863 should probably be seen in a new light. True, Knowth was then attacked by the Vikings who did so in their capacity as allies of Lorc?n mac Cathail, King of Meath. Indeed, the pace setter may well have been Lorc?n and his designs were probably political. Knowth may well, indeed, have been sacked and looted for the reason that it was the centre of the North Brega dynasty and hardly solely because the Vikings thought that the passage graves contained treasures. If Knowth was then a royal residence some refurbishing of the site could have taken place and this might have led to the discovery of the chamber or chambers which, together with some souterrains, might have been used as store places by the occupants at that time. But perhaps Burials 1-3 are Irish, although this is hard to accept because of the associated grave goods, unless these can be dated back to the Iron Age. Could it be that the North Brega dynasty was susceptible to foreign influence? There is evidence for this not only in their Norse alliances (which, of course, was by no means an exclusive North Brega peculiarity); but, as Professor Byrne points out, in the tendency to alliteration found in their pedigrees. If future research conclusively establishes that Knowth was used as a place of residence during the Early Christian period then native occupation may have gone on unbroken from at least as early as the eighth century down to the twelfth century, ceasing only when the site was taken over by the Normans for use as a mote in the year 1175. What subsequently happened at Knowth is not clear; but if not during Norman occupation, at least soon after, for the second time in history Knowth declined in importance, although the sherds of medieval pottery hint at some activity on the site as late as the end of the thirteenth or the beginning of the fourteenth century. Thereafter it became a ghost site and when again, in the nineteenth century, interest in Knowth was revived it was from the antiquarian and archaeological points of view.

Meath, 1962-65. 383 APPENDIX HISTORICAL NOTE ON CNOGBA (KNOWTH) by F. J. Byrne University College, Dublin From the beginning of the ninth century the kings of Brega?the northern branch of the U? N?ill dynasty known as the Sil n?edo Sl?ine?seem to have resided at or near the prehistoric mound of Knowth. Two of them are specifi cally titled kings of Cnogba in the Annals of Ulster: Cernach mac Congalaig s.a. 818, and M?elmithig mac Flannac?in s.a. 918, while the latter's son, who briefly restored the high-kingship to the dynasty in the mid-tenth century, is commonly referred to as Congalach Cnogba. Similarly, their cousins the kings of South Brega (Deiscert Breg) are frequently styled kings of Lagore (Loch Gabor) between the years 786 and 969. A poem commonly ascribed to Flann Mainistrech (-f 1056), fer l?igind of Monasterboice and direct descen dant of several kings of Fir Arda Ciannachta in south Louth, also associates many of the kings of Brega with Knowth.1 Thus Dungal (*j-759) is called (not strictly accurately, as we shall see) D?ngal Cnogba co cliaraib, and Domnall mac Congalaig (f976) cul?n c?em Chnogba, 'the comely cub of Knowth' ;2 and we are told that Cernach hua Congalaig (presumably \mac Congalaig, f818) was slain by Cin?ed i taig Cnogba, 'in the house of Knowth'. It is a well-known feature of the later medieval bardic poetry that topo graphical epithets are used with extreme looseness. It was a routine clich? for the poet to affect to regard his patron as rightful ruler of Ireland?in other words 'king of Tara'. As Tara lay in Brega, the latter term was frequently employed as a useful synonym. This of course was at variance with the historical facts, since the high-kingship of Tara was by no means the undisputed pre rogative of the local ruler of Brega and after the early eighth century was never (with a sole exception provided by Congalach mac M?elmithig) held by him. The name of Knowth (Cnogba) was in turn pressed into the bardic service as a further equivalent. Thus in a poem to Uilliam ? Ceallaigh composed in 1351 Gofraidh Fionn ? D?laigh styles the Gonnacht prince sgath Breagh, 'scion of Brega', and ban gCnodhbha* 'chief of Knowth'. With even less justifi cation does Tadhg Dali ? hUiginn call one of the Burkes 'a prince from the plain of Knowth' (d'ua na flatha ? chl?r Chnodhbha), and another of the same family 'a charmed diadem from the fairy mound of Knowth' (a mhionn s?anta a Siodh Chnodhbha).* Notable here is the identification of Knowth with a sid 1 LL 185b; Rawl.

Meath, 1962-65. 385 necropolis as a whole. Examples of the use of Knowth as an epitheton ornans could be multiplied almost indefinitely from the corpus of bardic verse.6 An early bardic poem from the twelfth century addressed to Ragnall king of Man has an interesting conceit treating Knowth as an entrance to the Otherworld. The poet identifies the Isle of Man with the Otherworld paradise of Emain Ablach ('Emain of the Apple-trees', the Arthurian Avalon), and declares that he has no need of a ship in order to travel to Ragnall's court, for 'many are the doorways of thy land, brighter are they than blue skins: among them, O branch of the haven of Eamhain, are the cave of Fern and the fair cave of Cnoghdha' : Doirsi t'fherainn as imdha, soillsi in?it sreabhainn ghorma, is dib, a chraebh chuain Emna, uaim Ferna, uaim chaem Cnoghdha.7 Here is apparently an echo of the triad : tri dorcha H?renn : ?am Chnogba, ?am Sl?ngae, dercc Ferna, 'the three dark places (or mysteries) of Ireland : the cave of Knowth, the cave of Sl?nga, the cave of Fern'.8 On a lighter, though still supernatural, note, we read in the thirteenth century burlesque tale Tromd?mh Guaire that the cave of Knowth was the dwelling of Irus?n mac Arus?n, king of the cats, satirised with nearly dis astrous consequences by Sench?n Toirp?ist. The tale locates the uaim Cnogda somewhat imprecisely as 'east of Clonmacnoise'.0 The Dindshenchas poem on Cam Chonaill ascribed to Mac Liac (f 1016) lists the chief strongholds of Brega granted in prehistoric times by Gairpre Nia Fer to the sons of ?m?r when they migrated from Scotland.10 They include Knowth (Cnogba Breg), R?th Cennaig (Rathkenny, between Slane and Nobber), R?th Chommair, Brug mn? Elcmair (probably Newgrange: Boann, the goddess of the Boyne, was wife of Elcmar,11 original owner of Brug na B?inne, and mother by the Dagda of ?engus Mac ind ?c), ?enach Tailten (Teltown), Tlachtga (the Hill of Ward), and other sites. Dissatisfied with the conditions of tax and tribute imposed on them by Gairpre the sons of ?m?r moved to Connacht where Ailill and Medb granted them lands in Clare and Galway. ?engus son of ?m?r gave his name to D?n ?engussa in Aran: he and his brothers were a remnant of the Fir Bolg.12 6 See, for instance, Leabhar Branach, ed.

The Dindshenchas of Knowth itself associates the mound with Englec, daughter of Elcmar and the beloved of ?engus Mac ind ?c and of Mider.13 The etymology of the name (from cn?-guba, 'nut-wailing' ), though not to be taken seriously, at least establishes that the correct Old Irish form was Cnogba. The common variant spelling Cnodba may be due to the analogy of Odba, another prominent site in Brega which O'Donovan would identify with a mound near Navan. The Dindshenchas however says that the original name of Cnogba was Cnocc Bui, and that it was the burial mound of Bua, daughter of Ruadr? Ruad and wife of Lug mac C?in. It must be stressed that most of the material found in the Dindshenchas collections consists of artificial learning rather than genuine traditional myth ology : very often one suspects ad hoc invention of a myth by the senchaid in order to explain an obscure name (and such suspicions are confirmed by the story of how Mong?n mac Fiachnai exposed the ignorance of the poets in these matters) .13a Nevertheless, it is probably significant that Bua should be connected with Cnogba, for that was a name of the Caillech B?rre, the hag associated with so many megalithic monuments in the folk tradition (the cemetery at Loughcrew is still known as Sliabh na Caillighe). That she should here be connected with the more civilised figure of the Celtic god Lug mac C?in means no more than that she was the mother-goddess of the local peoples : as the introductory note to the famous eighth-century poem says, 'her grand children and great-grandchildren were peoples and races' (comtar t?atha -] chen?la a hu? -\ a iarmui).u By process of rationalisation therefore the Dind shenchas has Carried' her to Lug, a god particularly associated with the Louth area, and almost certainly identical with Tadg mac C?in, ancestor of the Ciannachta of Ferrard and Duleek baronies as well as of the Gailenga and related tribes throughout Meath.15 The author of the dindshenchas poem gives his name as Flann and is identi fied by the scribes with the early tenth-century poet Flann mac Lon?in (falsely, according to Thurneysen, who regards the poem as a good deal later).16 He appears to give a variant origin story in the last portion of the poem : Senchas aile-so, is ?ol dam, a chnuic ?t ata oc Dubthach : dor?nad, cid mor in mod, lasin mBresal mb?-d?bod. This is translated by Gwynn as follows : 'There is another tale?'tis known to me? of that hill, which Dubthach possesses : it was made, though great the exploit, by Bresal B?d?bad.'17 13 MD hi. 40. 13* See ?riu, viii (1916), 155-60. i* R.I.A.

Heldensage, p.603. 17 MD iii. 43 j this quatrain is only found in two of the four MS$,</page><page sequence="89">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 387 Bressal B?d?bad figures in the prehistoric lists of the kings of Ireland, and as son of Rudraige as king of Emain Macha in the thoroughly artificial Senchas Sit /r.18 He is said to have been slain and succeeded as king of Ireland by Lugaid Luaigne (another alias for Lug, here seen as ancestor of the Luaigne). The Dindshenchas legend is clearly based on biblical motifs but may be not without interest to archaeologists. Bressal wished to emulate Nimrod by building a tower that would reach to heaven, and his sister stood (apparently on a nearby hill) to work a druidic spell so that the sun might not set until the tower was completed. But Bressal committed incest with her at Ferta Cuile: the sun set, and 'from that day forth the hill remains without addition to its height'. Now the Dubthach mentioned here, apparently as owner of Knowth, is otherwise unknown : he cannot be identified with any of the recorded princes of Brega. Moreover, the prose Dindshenchas has precisely the same legend in relation, not to Knowth, but to Dowth.19 Here the aetiological element is clearer, for it is stated that the men of Ireland had only contracted to put in one day's work on the building, and that when night fell as a consequence of Bressal's interruption of his sister's magic, they returned home each to his place. ' "Dubad (darkness) shall be the name of this place for ever", said the maiden.' It is obvious therefore that the second half of Flann's poem refers to Dowth (Dubad), and that the second line of the quatrain quoted above should read : an chnuic ?t ata oc Dubad 'of that hill which is at Dowth', which incidentally gives correct rhyme with dam in the preceding line, as Dubthach does not. The references to Dowth in the annals show that the name Dubad referred to the place rather than to the mound itself (called Cnoc Dubadha in the Dindshenchas). Thus the well-known entry at AU 863, AFM 861?to be discussed in more detail below?says that the mound was 'above Dubad', and we hear too of a church at the site: AU 1012 records the slaying of ?engus, airchinnech of Sl?ine (Slane) by the airchinnech of Dubad, and AFM lists the church among those burnt in 1170 by Diarmait Mac Murchada. Knowth is referred to as Cnogba na rrtg, 'of the kings', in the twelfth century recension of the Tain Bo Cuailnge in the Book of Leinster.20 In the same text, when the charioteer Ibar takes the boy Cu Chulainn on his first expedition, he points out to him the d?niai ocus dindgnai, 'the buildings and high places (or monuments) ' of Mag Breg : Tara and Tailtiu, Cleittech (the royal residence on the Boyne where both Cormac mac Airt and Muirchertach Mac Erca were said to have met their deaths?in both cases by maleficent magic), and Cnogba and Brug Meic inn ??c (Newgrange) and Dun mac Nechtain Scene (unidentified). Two poems in the Book of Leinster in praise of Cerball mac Muirec?in, king of Leinster (885-909), are ascribed to his court poet Dalian mac More. Both credit Cerball with prodigious victories which, it must be said, are but 18 O'Brien, Corpus Genealogiarum Hiberniae, i. 120, 275f. i?

The first poem may be earlier in date than the second (which has achieved some celebrity as the 'Song of Carroll's sword' through Meyer's translation in Ancient Irish poetry), but is hardly con temporary: the final verses give some regnal synchronisms purporting to date its composition which contain several anachronisms. It begins: Cerball Currig c?emLife cl?d catha for Cond : ra fhaicsin a ?ebdreche arbath Cnogba corr. (LL 47a) This is echoed in the fifteenth quatrain of the Sword poem : Is romut ro thraiged tess i cath B?inne na mborbchless, dar thuit Cnogba cleth inn ?ig immut fh?gad ar th'orgr?in. (LL 47b 28)21 In both cases Meyer has translated as though Cnogba were a personal name (and indeed it is possible that the author of the second poem may himself have been misled by the bold metaphor of the first) : 'Cerball of the Curragh of lovely LiiFey, overthrower of battles on Conn's Half?when he beheld his beautiful countenance Cnogba Corr fell dead.'22 (Read : 'at the sight of his glorious countenance peaked Knowth [or perhaps 'the peak of Knowth'] collapsed.') 'Before thee they ebbed southwards in the battle of the Boyne of the rough feats, When Cnogva fell, the lance of valour [read: 'the support of valour'], at seeing thee, for dread of thee.'23 The 'Annals of Tigernach' and the Four Masters state that in 1039 Mac Gilla P?traic, king of Ossory and Leinster, burnt Mide as far as Knowth and Drochat ?tha. Here Mide is used in its later sense for the whole of the Southern U? N?ill over-kingdom: earlier usage confined it to Westmeath and parts of Longford and Offaly, thus distinguishing it from Brega. Drochat ?tha, it should be noted, is not the modern Drogheda, but in the pre-Norman annals always means Oldbridge: Mellifont is referred to in the Irish annals as the monastery of Drochat Atha. 21 The preceding quatrain asserts that Gerbairs sword slew Cellach mac Flannac?in in battle at Tara. According to the annals, however, Cellach, Hgdomna of all Brega, was slain treacherously in 895 by Fogartach mac Tolairg who later became king of south Brega. 22 Revue Celtique, xxix. 210. 23 Ancient Irish poetry, p.73,</page><page sequence="91">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 389 The best-known annalistic record of Knowth is of course that which tells of the plundering of the Boyne tumuli by the Vikings in 863. AU have the following entry: Uamh Achaidh Alddai -j Cnodhbai -] Uam Fheirt Boadan ?s Dubadh 1 Uam Mn? an Gobann roscr?idiset Gaill, quod antea non perfectum est .i. a fecht roslatsat .iii. r?gh Gall ferann Flaind meic Conaing .i. Amhlaim -| Imhar -| Auisle -j Lorc?n mac Cathail leo occa, ri Mide. This was in the year following the death of the great high-king M?elsechnaill mac M?elruanaid, who seems to have been the first to make the U? N?ill claim to suzerainty over all Ireland a political reality. In the process he was faced with the enmity of the Sil nAedo Sl?ine of Brega (he himself repre senting the rival Mide dynasty of Clann Cholm?in)?and in particular of the northern branch of that dynasty who had their centre at Knowth and claimed to be overlords of all Brega. The Sil n?edo Sl?ine had been excluded for a century and a half from the U? N?ill high-kingship of Tara and the Knowth kings had on occasion allied themselves with the newly established Norse kingdom of Dublin. In 851 the king of Brega, Cin?ed mac Conaing was captured and drowned by M?elsechnaill and by Cin?ed 's cousin and rival, Tigernach king of Lagore, dif?esmaib degdoine n?renn*] Comarbbai P?traic specialiter (AU), 'in spite of the guarantees of the nobles of Ireland and of the coarb of Patrick in particular' (not, as Hennessy translates, 'with the approval of5).24 In the closing years of M?elsechnailPs reign Cin?ed 's brother Flann is found allied with ?ed Findliath of the Northern U? N?ill,25 and with Olaf of Dublin in rebellion against the high-king. When ?ed himself became high-king it is not surprising that Lorc?n, the new king of Mide, should have joined Olaf, Ivar and Auisle in ravaging Flann's territory. In 864 ?ed had Lorc?n blinded and deposed, but Flann ungratefully enough reversed his alliance, called in the Norse, and was slain by ?ed at the battle of Cell ua nDaigre in 868. As the Norse were accustomed in their own homelands to royal burial mounds enclosing treasure, it was natural for them to make quite a habit of exploring such 'caves' in Ireland. An expedition for this purpose in Kerry led by the Dublin king Barid is recorded in the Annals of Inisfallen at 873.25a As for the plundering of the Boyne tumuli, the Four Masters have some interesting 24 See the R.I.A. Dictionary of the Irish language, fasciculus iii, col. 15, s.v.f?essam. 26 The Three fragments of annals edited by O'Donovan assert that Flann was Aed's nephew (p. 176) and also that Olaf of Dublin was Aed's son-in law (p. 150). 25a Captain Kevin Danaher has drawn my attention to a passage from the Icelandic Landn?mab?k, I, 3. ?4: ". . . Leif went on cruising in the West. He harried in Ireland, and found a great earth house (jardh?s) there, and went in there, and it was dark inside till light shone from a weapon which a man was holding. This man Leif slew, and took the sword and much other riches. After this he was called - Sword-Leif (Hjorleifr). Hjorleif harried far and wide in Ireland and got great booty there." The Irish word uam may mean a natural cave, a passage-grave, or a souterrain. Most probably it was souterrains that were plundered in Kerry. In view of the presence of souterrains on the Knowth site, we cannot be certain that the Vikings actually entered the passage-grave as they did at Maes Howe in the Orkneys.</page><page sequence="92">390 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. additional details in their entry, s.a. 861. They say that Uam Achaid Alddai28 was hi Mughdhornaibh Maighen. The Mugdornai were a tribe of the Airgialla who seem to have been of considerable importance in the early period. The Mugdornai Maigen gave their name to the barony of Cremorne in Monaghan (Grich Mugdorn), but at this date probably inhabited Farney as well. They had another branch, the Mugdorna Breg, who must have extended well into northern Meath, though their precise boundaries are most uncertain, and O'Donovan suggested that the reading of the Four Masters was a mere slip and should refer to them. Uam Fheirt Boadan, 'the cave of the grave-mound of Boadu', is glossed .i. buachaill Elcmaire?Boadu or Boadan being identified as Elcmar's herdsman. Boadan is mentioned by Cin?ed ua hArtac?in (1*975) in his poem on the dindshenchas of Brug na B?inne.27 'The cave of the smith's wife' is located eg Droichead ?tha, and so is probably not New grange (which one would expect to be called Brug Maic ind ?c). It could be Coffey's Tumulus B, which is nearest to the river, or Tumulus J, which is closest to Oidbridge. If the reference to the Mugdorna (Breg rather than Maigen) is correct, we should look for Uam Achaid Alddai somewhat to the north of the same general area.28 Although the annalistic references to Knowth itself are not so frequent as those to Lagore, it is clear that both sites were, at least in the ninth and tenth centuries, the residences of the kings of north and south Brega respec tively and were used as their official titles. As we shall see, however, the northern sub-division of the dynasty was the more successful?after 724 they seem to monopolise the title ri Breg or ri Breg n-uile, 'king of all Brega'. Of the Lagore dynasty only Tigernach mac F?cartai (f865) attains even the status of leth-ri Breg, 'joint king of Brega', and that almost certainly due to his alliance with the high-king M?elsechnaill. Furthermore, Lagore never had the magical aura of legend surrounding Knowth, and never found its way into the bardic repertoire of royal epithets. The association of royal sites of the historic and proto-historic period with megalithic monuments of the very distant past is a most remarkable feature of Irish history. We now know that Tara itself is such a site. It is difficult not to agree with the concluding sentences of ? R?ord?in and Daniel in their book on New Grange that this continuity of tradition bespeaks a strong ethnic survival?and, one might add, is a most impressive body of evidence which has been strangely ignored in learned discussion of the Celtic invasions. 26 According to Flann Mainistrech (LL 11a 21) Edleo mac Aldui was the first of the Tuatha D? Danann to die in Ireland. LL 10 a/b says that most of the Tuatha Do Danann were descended from Aldae's father Tat mac Tabuirn (the name Tat is probably the Welsh tadf 'father'). 27 MD ii. 12. This poem is addressed to Gongalach mac M?elmithig (f956). 28 The poems on Brug na B?inne by Cin?ed ua hArtac?in and Macnia mac ?engussa (MD ii. 10-25), together with Cin?ed's other poem on ?engus's taking of the Brug (LL 208b = ?riu, vii. 210)?actually a twelfth-century composition according to Murphy, ?riu, xvi. 156? need further study. Cin?ed's references to Fiacc and the pool of Fiac west of Brug na B?inne suggest a relationship with the Ferti virorum F?ec (Ferta Fer F?ic) near Slane mentioned by Muirchu and the Vita Tripartita.</page><page sequence="93">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co. Meath, 1962-65. 391 The annals supply us with abundant material concerning the Sil n?edo Sl?ine and the Brega region in general. The detailed references to churches such as Duiane, Trevet, Lusk, Kildalkey and others provide a useful corrective to the picture of the early Irish church which is normally drawn from hagio graphical sources. It is evident that one of the chronicles which was used by the compilers of our early annalistic corpus?if not the actual compilation itself, or some stage of it redaction?must have been written in a Brega monas tery. It is most probable, for instance, that the Liber Cuanach cited so frequently as a source for variant dates in the Annals of Ulster up to 629, was a chronicle written by or in the possession of Cuanu nepos Bess?in, scriba of Trevet, whose death is recorded AU 739. Trevet, it is clear, was the principal church of the Lagore kings. We also learn from AU 800 that these kings of south Brega held an ?enach at the church of Mac Cuiiinn of Lusk, for in that year Ailill mac Fergusa was thrown from his horse at the 'fair' (in circio ferie filii Cuiiinn Luscan) and killed. Pending a full study of the kingdom of Brega and its sub-kingdoms, which I hope to publish at a future date, I include here a genealogical table which adds some further details to those already provided by MacNeill and the late Dr. Liam Price.29 Unless otherwise stated, all dates are from AU, suitably corrected by the addition of a year to the printed date up to 1013.30 Wherever a personage has been given a title in AU this has been inserted in the table : such titles from other sources have been ignored. For convenience, kings who are reckoned as high-kings of Ireland in the conventional lists have been numbered with Roman numerals in accordance with Fr. John Ryan's R?im Rioghraidhe na h?ireann (Three Candles, 1940). Arabic numerals have been used to denote the kings of Brega as enumerated in the poem Sil ?edaSl?ne na sieg published by MacNeill under the nameof Flann Mainistrech.31 This poem contains several errors: for instance, it omits Conaing mac Flainn (f849) and his son Dunchad (f831), who are both recorded as kings in the annals. More serious is the total disarray in the chronology of the regnal years assigned to each king. MacNeill took note of the discrepancies, stating: 'In [poem] VIL, which deals with the dynasty of Brega, Flann is in his own district, and does not depend on our chronicle,32 indeed is often remarkably at variance with it. No doubt the manuscripts of Monasterboice afforded plenty of data, authentic and otherwise, about the kings of Brega.'33 This attempt at an explanation is unsatisfactory, for the annals, as we have seen, appear to derive from a Brega chronicle and their general accuracy seems unimpeachable. Furthermore, the poem ends with Muirchertach ua 29 Archivium Hibernicum', ii (1913), opposite p.46; R.I.A. Proc, liii C 32, opposite p.22. 30 This is not to imply the absolute accuracy of these dates: external checks show the chronology of AU to be incorrect by a year or two at several points in the sixth and seventh centuries. 31 Arch.

(LL 186a 9). 'Search for what there is besides, bard Fintan, thou learned man, since there is no longer here the age of ?ed Sl?ne's race.'34 The reference to 'bard Fintan', which puzzled MacNeill, is probably to be understood in the light of the Middle Irish text 'The settling of the manor of Tara', published by Best in ?riu, iv (1910) 121-72, in which the antediluvian Fintan mac B?chra relates the pre-history of Ireland and the correct division of the provinces to an assembly of the U? N?ill at Tara. Less probably, it may refer to the author of the poem. It is reasonably certain that the ascription to Flann Mainistrech is a libel on that scholar's learning. It is true, as MacNeill remarks, that M?el sechnaill, like his predecessors of the Clann Cholm?in, waged a bitter feud against the Sil n?edo Sl?ine, and that in the eleventh century the kingship of Brega often passed out of their hands, but it is not correct to imply that the dynasty had died out in Flann's own lifetime. It was represented by the families of Ua Cellaig and Ua Congalaig, several of whom are accorded the title of king of Brega in the annals down to the Norman invasion.36 SU ?eda Sl?ne na sieg is the last of a group of seven poems in the Book of Leinster. The first five deal with Ailech and the princes of Cen?l nE?gain. MacNeill has shown that poems I, II, IV and V are in effect a single composition by Flann Mainis trech. Poem III is intrusive and may not be by Flann.36 Poems VI and VII, unlike the others, are also found in Rawlinson B 502. Poem VI, Mide magen clainne Cuind, deals with the Clann Cholm?in; a scribal ascription to Flann Mainistrech has been erased in LL.37 Poem VII bears no ascription, and neither poem seems earlier than the Rawlinson manuscript itself, which was written in the first half of the twelfth century.38 There is therefore no reason to saddle Flann Mainistrech with responsibility for its blunders. The first annalistic notice of a king of Knowth, however, does not refer to one of the Sil n?edo Sl?ine nor to any of the U? N?ill.

The Gailenga Mora were to the north of the Boyne and Blackwater and gave their name to the barony of Morgallion (Machaire Gaileng). Genealogically, the Gailenga were closely connected with the Saitne of north county Dublin and with the Luigne, whose name survives in the barony of Lune, although it is clear that they were not confined to that area, which at least until 837 was in the hands of the U? N?ill dynasty of Cen?l nArdgail.40 All three tribes claimed descent from Gormac Gaileng son of Tadg mac C?in. Tadg was the ancestor too of the Ciannachta, whose territory (allegedly won by Tadg from the Ulaid as ally of Cormac mac Airt in the battle of Crinna) stretched on both sides of the lower Boyne in the baronies of Duleek and Ferrard and part of Ardee. Together these peoples represented the main substratum of population under the U? N?ill dynasts of Brega. An ancient common tribal name for the whole group may be preserved by the archaic place-name in campo Taidcni recorded by T?rech?n.41 Hogan would connect this with the site of the synod of 1158, Bri mace Thaidg,42 which Paul Walsh in turn identified with Bree mount, south of Trim (Bray Hill, Stokes town, parish of Laracor).43 The Gailenga and Luigne are also found in close proximity in northern Connacht (baronies of Gallen and Leyney), while the Ciannachta had a northern branch among the Cen?l nE?gain (barony of Keenaght, county Derry). O'Rahilly challenged MacNeill's interpretation of this geographical distribution as representing a deliberate colonisation of the midlands with their vassals by the Connacht ancestors of the U? N?ill ;u but it must be said that he was himself biassed by his own notion that the Connachta and U? N?ill represented a Q,-Celtic invasion of Ireland from the Meath coast?a theory which is supported by no evidence whatever, and indeed is contradicted by the observable growth of U? N?ill territory within the historical period. O'Rahilly dismisses too the tribal connection between Luigne and Gailenga and seeks to identify the latter with the G?ili?in (an archaic name for the Laigin). He further regards the form Luigne as the Goidelic version of P-Celtic Luaigne. He is correct in stressing that the Luaigne are only referred to in pre-historic traditions (which associate them with Tara), but the precise relationship?if any?between them and the historic Luigne remains obscure, since O'Rahilly's hypotheses, even when plausible, are incapable of proof.46 3?

The genealogical tradition which brought these peoples from Munster and connected them with the Eile, and more distantly with the D?l Cais and Delbna (who were scattered across Connacht and Mide),46 bears all the marks of artificiality. But it may enshrine a genuine belief that they were ?rainn, and this might account perhaps for the tradition that Knowth was connected with the Caillech B?rre : her closest ties were with the ?rainn tribes of Corcu Duibne and Muscraige. Among the other tributary peoples of Brega were the D?isi Breg or D?isi Temro (literally, 'the vassal peoples of Tara'). It is doubtful whether there was any real connection between these and the D?isi Muman. The story of the 'Expulsion of the D?isi' was probably invented to give the latter an an cestry befitting their political status, just as was done in the case of the Airgialla and U? Maine. In the process they were accorded a pedigree which linked them with the ancestors of the U? N?ill. Presumably the D?isi Breg were the original occupiers of the site of Lagore, which lies in the barony of Ratoath beside the baronies of Deece. It is significant that the use of the title r? Locha Gabor by princes of the Sil n?edo Sl?ine dates from 786 : the D?isi Breg dis appear as a political entity from the Annals of Ulster after 777, to re-emerge in the eleventh century at a period when the Gailenga and Saitne under Ua Leoch?in and Ua Gathussaig were claiming the title of king of Brega once monopolised by their U? N?ill overlords. Brega also contained two intrusive Airgialla tribes?the U? Mac Uais Breg and the Mugdornai Breg. By the eighth century at any rate they were part of the Brega over-kingdom and not politically affiliated to the Airgialla.47 It is extremely difficult to draw exact tribal boundaries valid for any one century of early Irish history : all we can say for certain is that these two tribes shared north Meath with the Gailenga Mora.48 Into the same area north of the Blackwater we must also fit a branch of the dominant Sil n?edo Sl?ine? the Fir G?l Breg. Their royal residence was at Oristown?R?th Airthir, 'the eastern fort'?so we may assume that they stretched westwards from there. Although the name Fir C?l remained, the dynasty seems to have declined and perhaps died out altogether in the course of the ninth century, when the territory fell under the control of the Gailenga and Luigne. It is against this background that we must view the disturbance of the ?enach 46 The fourteenth-century Aided Muirchertaig Meic Erca (ed. Nie. Dhonnchadha), p.lOf., groups the Dealbna with the two Gailenga, two Luigne, Saitne, Ciannachta and U? Aeda Odba. 47 The same phenomenon may be observed of the northern U? Mac Uais of Derry and Tyrone, who were early drawn into the Cen?l nE?gain ambit and separated from Airgialla proper. 48 If north Meath seems overcrowded, the baronies of Moyfenrath are practically a blank on the political map: doubtless they were largely waste. O'Donovan had placed the U? Mac Uais Breg here, which might help to explain the old verse which assigns to the Airgialla territory stretching from Loch Febail (Lough Foyle) to Buaigne (see ?riu, xvi. 182, q.27). Buaigne, Buaidgein, or Buaignech seems to have been the name of an area which included Galtrim (bar. Lower Deece) and Dunboyne (D?n Buaignige, not 'Dun B?inne'). The Book of Lecan, 298 also asserts that Airgialla extended from Tara to Tonn Tuaige (the mouth of the Bann). However, Paul Walsh's arguments {Place-names of Wesimeath, p.298) in favour of placing the U? Mac Uais near Kilshine are supported by the annalistic references.</page><page sequence="97">Eogan?Excavations at Knowth, Co.

That the Gailenga also extended into County Cavan is shown by the destruc tion of a pirate base of the Gailenga and Luigne on Loch Ramor by the high king M?elsechlainn in 847. In the twelfth century, when Ua Ruairc of Br?ifne advanced into Mide, we find his sub-king Ua Ragallaig assuming the title of ri Machaire Gailengy and the new kingdom of Br?ifne reaching as far south as Droichet ?tha. Parallel and contemporaneous with this development was the conquest of all county Louth by Ua Cerbaill of Airgialla entailing the disappearance of Conaille Muirthemne and Fir Arda Ciannachta.49 The southern U? N?ill who ruled in the midlands were divided into at least eight different dynasties, all claiming descent from Niall;50 but the two who became dominant?the Clann Cholm?in of Mide and the Sil n?edo Sl?ine of Brega?were both sprung from a great-grandson of Mall's, Diarmait mac Cerbaill (f565), whom Adomn?n in the late seventh century styled ruler of all Ireland.51 Adomn?n also refers to the internecine feuds which were to weaken the Brega dynasty when he represents Columba as warning ?ed Sl?ine son of Diarmait ne tibi a Deo totius Everniae regni praerogativam mon archiae praedestinatam parricidali faciente peccato amittas.52 In the event, within a generation of Adomn?n's death, the Sil n?edo Sl?ine ceased to be the chief among the southern U? N?ill septs. Up to the reign of Cin?ed mac ?rgalaig (f728) several members of the dynasty had claimed the high-kingship of Tara, and (as indicated in the appended table) were later reckoned among the 'High-Kings of Ireland'. The earliest extant list of the high-kings of Tara is the Baile Chuind,5Z composed in the reign of Finsnechta Fledach (1*695), and it does not confirm all these claims.54 It admits Diarmait mac Cerbaill and his grandsons Diarmait (auae alaili, i.e., 'the grandson of the other Diarmait') and Blathmac, as well as Finsnechta 49 The Conaille Muirtheimne, who first appear as a kingdom in 688 in the annals (Muirch?, who also mentions them, was writing about this date), were a sub-kingdom of Ulaid. Between them and the Fir Arda lay the Fir Rois, a sub-kingdom of Airgialla?see Fr. Diarmuid Mac ?omhair, 'The boundaries of Fir Rois', in Louth Arch. Soc. JnLs xv (1962), 144-79. 60 Professor Kelleher has recently expressed the opinion that 'the U? N?ill were a federation of eight tribes, some of which were themselves multiple, boasting an impossible descent from a single ancestor in the early fifth century.' (North Munster Studies, ed. Rynne [1967], p.233). It is difficult to see why descent from Niall Noigiallach should be dismissed so summarily, though admittedly the official pedigree of Diarmait mac Gerbaill does arouse some suspicion, and the earlier sixth-century king Muirchertach Mac Erce may be a conflation of two distinct personages. But as the U? N?ill spent much of their energy fighting one another one would think that they had more reason to disclaim common ancestry than to fabricate it: there does not seem to be sufficient motive for such a forgery at this stage. I think that Kelleher is here misusing the word 'tribe'?at best an unsatisfactory and ambiguous term. The U? N?ill were a dynasty, not a tribe or tribal federation. There is no example of the use of moccu with any of the dynastic eponyms enshrined in the U?, Cen?l or SU formulas. I would venture tentatively to suggest that the emergence of the U? N?ill was part of an evolution from 'tribalism' to a polity of dynastic territorial kingdoms?and in the same article Professor Kelleher does imply that such an evolution was taking place. 51 Vita Columbae, i. 36. 52 Ibid., i. 14. 03 Ed. Murphy, ?riu, xvi (1952), 146f. 64 It shows that the high-kingship of Tara was a prize to be won rather than a normal tribal or dynastic kingship that was succeeded to on the death of the previous holder. It also confirms one's suspicions as to the alleged tenure of that office by certain ephemeral U? N?ill kings in the sixth century?see, e.g., my remarks in Historical Studies V, p.45.</page><page sequence="98">396 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. himself, but it omits ?ed Sl?ine and Blathmac's sons Sechnussach and Cend f?elad. Interestingly, it does admit Coirpre, traditionally the eldest son of Niall and founder of dynasties centred at Drumcliff, county Sligo, Granard, county Longford, and Carbury, county Kildare. Coirpre's name has been expunged from all the later regnal lists, and the failure of his once powerful house is reflected in the hagiography as early as the seventh century. T?rech?n and the Vita Tripartita bring Patrick face to face with the hostile Coirpre at the ?enach Tailten and then relate his meeting with Conall, grandfather of Diarmait mac Cerbaill, at ecclesia Patricii magna (Domnach Mor P?traic?it is uncertain whether this is Donaghmore or Donaghpatrick). The saint promises Conall that semen fratrum tuorum tuo semini serviet in aeternum.55 It seems clear that the Sil n?edo Sl?ine ruled not merely over tribes such as the Gailenga, Luigne, Saitne and Ciannachta, as well as the U? Mace Uais ?reg and the Mugdornai Breg, but also exercised suzerainty over the U? N?ill septs of L?egaire and Ardgal. A late Middle Irish poem in the genealogies on the sons of ?ed Sl?ine asserts that they were all buried at Imlech Becc?n (Emlagh).56 This contra dicts the Dindshenchas poem on Cerna, which lists many of the descendants of ?ed Sl?ine as having been buried in that ancient pagan cemetery.57 Cerna is apparently to be identified with Carnes in the barony of Duleek (and there fore would have been in Ciannachta territory prior to 688). Possibly the name may originally have been of rather wider application : if it had included the whole of the high ground between Duleek and Naul, the cemetery of Cerna might be Fourknocks, about four miles south-east of Carnes. Clonalvy, just beside Fourknocks, seems a most likely location for the famous Lia Ailbe, the standing stone described in the Annals of Ulster as 'the chief monument of Brega' (primh-dindgnai Maighi Bregh) in 999, when it fell and was made into four mill-stones by M?elsechlainn the high-king (almost certainly in pur suance of his vendetta against the Sil n?edo Sl?ine) ,58 This is not the place in which to examine in detail the history of the Brega kingdom or the internal feuds of the Sil n?edo Sl?ine and the repeated attempts made to suppress them by the Clann Cholm?in from the reign of Donnchad Mide (770-797) onwards. It is a remarkable testimony to their vigour that despite their own rivalries, they were able in the seventh and eighth centuries to expand their territory at the expense of their neighbours. The final split within the dynasty occurred in 688 at the battle of Imlech Pich, where Niall mac Cernaig Sotail (1*701) defeated his cousin Congalach mac Conaing (f696).59 Slain on the losing side was the sub-king of Cian nachta, and according to the Three Fragments : in hoc bello alienam pattens domina ??

Meath, 1962-65. 397 Honem Ciannachtea gens privata est regno. At any rate, Congalach's family, the northern branch of the dynasty, seem to have consoled themselves for their defeat by taking over most of the territory of their allies the Ciannachta. Congalach's descendants retrieved their position somewhat by setting up the very successful kingdom of North Brega, which from about the year 800 had its royal centre at Knowth. When they are not actually kings of all Brega they are usually styled in the annals 'kings of Ciannachta'. Thus they took over the tribal name of their newly acquired lands : the first king to be so styled is Conaing mac Amalgado (f 742). Such a geographical application of a population name, and in particular its usurpation by outsiders, would scarcely have been possible in the earlier, more purely tribal, stage of Irish society, and it is significant that the moccu formula, denoting tribal origin^ did not survive into the eighth century. The true Ciannachta continued their independent existence as a kingdom north of the Boyne under the name Fir Ardda Ciannachta: an attempt by Cummuscach mac Congalaig (*f839) to intrude his son Cin?ed (|828) there too was unsuccessful. It will be seen that the establishment of the Knowth and Lagore dynasties was roughly contemporaneous. The first occurrence of the former title applied to a prince of the Sil nAedo Sl?ine is in 818: previously the site was apparently in the hands of the Gailenga. Lagore is first mentioned as a royal site in 786, although the Annals of Ulster record a defeat of the Laigin by Finsnechta Fledach in 676 in loco proximo Locha Gabhra. The kings of Lagore were constantly at enmity with their Knowth cousins, but they never attained the position of kings of all Brega, although they may on occasion have pre vented the Knowth kings from doing so. In 935 the Dublin king Olaf grandson of Ivar destroyed both Lagore and the 'cave' of Knowth within a week of one another.60 In view of the rather sweeping inferences which have sometimes been made from the tenth-century saga about M?elodr?n, it is as well to stress that there is no historical evidence that Lagore was the residence of Diarmait and Blathmac nor of any of the high-kings of the race of ?ed Sl?ine.61 We have seen that in the ninth century the Sil nAedo Sl?ine were quite willing to make alliances with the Norse either against each other or against the Clann Cholm?in. Similar susceptibility to foreign influences is suggested by the peculiar phenomenon that the Knowth dynasty from the very beginning of its separate existence in the seventh century exhibited a marked tendency to alliteration (on the letter C) in its pedigrees : names such as Congal, Conaing, Congalach, Cin?ed, Cernach, Cummuscach, Cellach, occur in every genera tion from 634 to 851. This feature is a characteristic of Germanic royal pedigrees, including those of the Anglo-Saxons, but is not usual in Ireland. The name Conaing itself, which first appears in this very pedigree (Conaing mac Congaile, 1*662), is a borrowing from the Anglo-Saxon cyning 'king'. 60 A.U. 935 : Inis Locha Gabhar do thoghail la hAmlalbh hua n?mair. Huam Cnoghbhai do thoghail do isint sechtmain c?dnai. 61 The historical unreliability of the saga has already been pointed out by Greene, Fingal Ron?in, (1955), pp.45f.</page><page sequence="100">398 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. A well-known event in Irish history, recorded both by Bede and the Irish annals, is the raid on Brega by Ecgfrith of Northumbria in 684. The motiva tion is obscure, and it represents the only known clash between the Anglo Saxons and the Irish (excluding the Scots of D?l Riata). We may note, however, that Coim?n R?mid of the northern U? N?ili dynasty of Cen?l nE?gain is said to have been the grandfather of Aldfrith, Ecgfrith's half brother and successor. Coim?n R?mid (f604) was regarded by the official senchas as having shared the High-Kingship of Ireland with ?ed Sl?ine. His brother M?el Umai (*f610) fought in ?ed?n mac Gabr?n's army against the Northumbrians at Degsastan.62 The raid of 684 seems to be referred to both in Crith Gablach and Baile Chuind. But as it turned out, the Britons were to prove more of a nuisance than the Saxons. After the destruction of the north British kingdom of Rheged, we find the expelled princes raiding in the Irish Sea. They were apparently based on the Isle of Man, whence they finally established a dynasty in North Wales under Mervyn Vrych in the early ninth century. In 702 they slew Conaing's son Irgalach, king of Brega, on Ireland's Eye. More friendly relations are evidenced by the retirement to 'Britannia' of Fogartach ua Cernaig of South Brega in 714, whence he returned to reclaim his kingdom in 716. A.U. 836 has a reference to a church in Deiscert Breg known as Dermag Britonum, and the abbot of Slane who died in 751 was called Coim?n na mBretan. In the eleventh century the kingdom of Brega became more of a geo graphical expression than a title of real political significance. It was often borne by rulers of the Gailenga and Luigne and Saitne, and there even seems (although this is not quite certain) to have been an intrusion of north Leinster princes, Ua Duinn and Ua Riac?in.63 The name Mide was extended to the whole of the southern U? N?ill territories under the rule of the Clann Cholm?in 'king of Tara'?a title which no longer implied a claim to the high-kingship of all Ireland. Ironically, the Ua M?elsechlainn family, which had so firmly established the Clann Cholm?in supremacy, itself fell into decline, and after the death of Conchobar Ua M?elsechlainn in 1074 (two years after his defeat of the powerful Leinster king and claimant to the high kingship, Diarmait mac M?el-na-mB?, at Odba), the midland kingdom became the prey of its ambitious neighbours. In 1146 Cellach Ua Cellaig, king of Brega, who belonged to the old Knowth dynasty, was slain by Flaithbertach Ua Cathassaig, of Saitne, repre sentative of a family which had on several occasions in the previous century usurped the kingship of Brega. In a charter originally written into the Book of Kells and dated c. 1129 x 1146, Cellach Hua Cellaig ri Breg appears as a guarantor together with a certain Hua Dondgaiie toisech tuaithi Cnogba.u Ua Dondgaile's affinities are not known: it is possible that the family was a 63 See Historical Studies V, p.46 and note 71. 63 Cf.

Meath, 1962-65. 399 collateral of Ua L?och?in, king of Gailenga.65 In his topographical poem written in the fourteenth century, Ua Dubhag?in lists Ua Dub?in as lord of Knowth.66 The O'Clery genealogies67 give the pedigree of Muintir Duaine ? Mainistir Buite (the Duanes of Monasterboice), the early portion of which agrees with the Ciannachta pedigree given in Rawlinson B 502, 145c 14, but the eponymous ancestor is very late?perhaps fifteenth-century. The name Dub?n does occur in the early part of the Ciannachta genealogies in Rawlinson B 502, 154a 24: among his descendants are Ind?irge mac Maile Temin (|909) and Iffern?n mac Canac?in.68 By the twelfth century Ua Ruairc of Br?ifne and his sub-king Ua Ragallaig had extended their territory to include Machaire Gaileng as far as Drochat Atha, and it may have been Tigern?n Ua Ruairc who granted Mellifont the grange of Knowth in 1157. It is first recorded as Mellifont porperty in the charter granted by John as Lord of Ireland in 1185-6, the first portion of which confirms grants made by Henry II in 1177-8.69 It is not unlikely that Henry too was simply confirming previous grants by Irish kings. It would have been tempting for Tigern?n to grant the former royal site to the Cistercians in order to deprive the original dynasty of any prestige they may have derived from its possession, just as Muirchertach Ua Briain sought to diminish the glory of the E?ganacht Caisil by giving Cashel to the Church. It is notable that at the consecration of Mellifont in 1157 both Ua Ruairc and Ua Cerbaill by their patronage may be said to have been seeking ecclesiastical approval of their relatively recent conquests. Significantly, the unfortunate representative of the once great southern U? N?ill, Donnchad Ua M?elsech lainn, was excommunicated by the same assembly. Whether or not Knowth was granted to Mellifont before the Norman invasion, the hill was to see one further adventure before settling down to a quiet existence as a Cistercian grange. In 1175 it was used as a mote during the Norman conquest of Meath.70 It may have been destroyed or abandoned during the successful Irish attack on Richard Fleming's castle at Slane in 1176?indeed the late Dr. Liam Price in some unpublished notes now in the possession of the Ordnance Survey Office, conjectures that Knowth itself may have been the site ofthat castle.71 At any rate, its impermanence suggests fl6 See Rawlinson B 502, 145b 50-c2; perhaps also A.F.M. 1032?Dondgal mac Duindcathaig of Gailenga slain (but A.U. have 'Domnall'). 66 Topographical Poems, (ed.

We know in fact that the compiler used such sources (see the editor's remarks, p.x, on the entries 1165, ?5 and 1167, ?8). The same annals, s.a. 1176, ?17 (? 1176, A.U., etc.) record the destruction by the Irish of Richard Fleming's cast?e at Dumhach Slaine'. The question is whether this is to be identified PROG.

(Creewood, three miles north-west of Slane) granted by Robert Flandrensis to Mellifont according to the charters of Henry II and John (see Fr. Golmcille, The story of Mellifont, pp. 38f.). Dr. Price, however, draws attention to the name 'Graud' which appears on the Ordnance Survey map between Knowth and Dowth, and wonders whether it is an old name. Could it possibly be a by-form of Knowth, showing the common substitution of cr for en? One would not, however, expect to find this sound-change represented as early as the date of the 'Song of Dermot\ (I owe the following note to Dr. Michael Herity: When the Ordnance Survey visited County Meath in 1837, John O'Donovan recorded in the Namebook for Monknewtown Parish that Cnoghbha was vulgarly pronounced Cru in the locality. Crewbane townland nearby would appear to enshrine this pronunciation. Could Crandone be equated with this form?)</page><page sequence="103">2. CONALL t612 FLANN t'714 S?L m 1. XIV. . 3.
