<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> History of Religions 185 do; and the purpose of announcing retributions in the afterlife is presumably at least  partly to serve as a deterrent in the present. davis’s downplaying of the ritual and supernatural dimensions of hindu law is in  keeping with his goal, described above, to humanize that tradition. granted, this also  reflects a tendency of some, especially later dharmaśāstra texts to focus on more  this-worldly topics (such as the Daṇḍaviveka, discussed at 136), as compared with  the Laws of Manu, for example, which reflects a greater concern with Brahmani- cal ritual and the topic of karma (as noted at 135 n. 19). it would be fascinating to  have an account of the opposed tendencies by different exponents of hindu law to  either “sacralize” or “secularize” that tradition. however, this question is largely  foreclosed by davis’s prior decision to focus on the secular or rather everyday  dimensions of hindu law. davis’s determination to translate dharma as “law” (rather than “religion”; 22),  and to focus on those aspects of the dharmaśāstra tradition that most resemble what  we recognize as law, raises a set of questions about the relations between the two  categories of “law” and “religion” that are not satisfactorily addressed in the volume  itself. The definition of law in general, and not merely hindu law, as the “theology  of ordinary life” (1) uses the term “theology” in the broad sense of “ideology,” in a  manner that obscures rather than illuminates the specific differences of hindu law,  which davis also refers to as “religious law” (10), to distinguish it from legal sys- tems such as our own. (The too-brief discussion of secularization [2], which deploys  a further contrast between “secular” and “transcendental theology,” does not help  much.) The phrase “theology of ordinary life” itself appears to be somewhat of an  oxymoron, as it combines the speculations of elites with the mundane practices of  the masses, and also elides the distinction between traditions focused on doxa and  those focused on praxis. davis is aware of this tension, and seeks to address it, for  example, by emphasizing (in chap. 7) the importance of local customs or ācāra as  opposed to the theological tradition of dharmaśāstra. yet the tension remains. The ways in which the laws of purity and pollution, and hindu law more gener- ally, articulate with the caste system are acknowledged (106, 173) but not made  a focus of the book. All in all, davis has given us a readable, reliable, and highly  sophisticated account of the principles of hindu law that will be of interest to all  scholars of hinduism and of comparative law. roberT a. yelle University of Memphis The Goddess and the Nation. By sumathi ramaswamy. durham, nC, and london:  duke University Press, 2010. Pp. xv+369, 150 plates, $27.95 (paper). The visual image of the hindu goddess Bharat mata (mother india) superimposed  upon a map of india has become nearly ubiquitous in the modern period as a symbol  of the nation, of the sacrality of the hindu goddess, and of a patriotic vision of the  bounty of india. But how did the cartographic image and the image of the goddess  come to be juxtaposed? What is the relationship between the scientific cartographic  </page> <page sequence="2"> 186 Book Reviews image and the religious iconography of the hindu goddess, Bharat mata? And how  did this visual iconography come to be so prevalent and compelling for the national- ist project? sumathi ramaswamy’s recent work The Goddess and the  Nation serves  as an elegant and insightful docent to the visual imagery of Bharat mata in the late  colonial and postcolonial periods. ramaswamy presents readers not only with a  nuanced interpretation of how these two images came to inhabit a singular space,  but also with a broader argument for the vitality of pictorial history as an effective  methodology. she demonstrates this by placing visual representations at the center  of her analysis, even while assenting that we must be by necessity “shuttling back  and forth to and from the world of words” (288). ramaswamy demonstrates what  she advocates by maintaining a delicate balance between art history, gender studies,  and postcolonial theory and by using contemporary visual images as much as textual  analyses to make a careful theoretical argument concerning the juxtaposition of  the scientific-cartographic (the map of india) and the anthropomorphic-sacred (the  goddess image of Bharat mata). she presents an effective and persuasive demon- stration of a visual-textual methodology that if taken seriously may have significant  effects on the way academics study contemporary cultures in modernity, in which  visual forms have certainly assumed equal footing with, if not wholly surpassed,  the textual. in chapters 1–4, ramaswamy eruditely demonstrates how the map and the god- dess historically interlaced into the quintessential symbol of the sacrality of the   nation that aimed to incite patriotic sentiment (and succeeded). she begins her   inquiry with the recent controversies surrounding maqbool fida husain’s depictions  of Bharat mata in the nude in 2004, which incited furor among contemporary hindu  nationalist groups in india who attacked the artist for daring to “disrobe our Beloved  Bharat mata” (5). After capturing her audience with this anecdote, she then provides  readers with a detailed pictorial history of Bharat mata as an iconographic visual  and emotive image, one that inspired and oriented many nationalist movements in  the late colonial period and into the twentieth century. in chapter 2, she argues that  the understanding of janmabhumi as motherland and the metaphorical conception  of india as the hindu goddess, Bharat mata, are novel and innovative outcomes of  territorialized nationalism—specifically, that the contemporary imagery of Bharat  mata should be viewed neither as an assumed conception nor as a natural progres- sion. in chapter 3, ramaswamy provides us with a valuable pictorial supplement  to the nineteenth century nationalist hymn, Vande Mataram, made so famous in  Bankim Chatterjee’s Anandamath. for those concerned with the late nineteenth- and  early twentieth-century history of hindu nationalism, her pictorial contribution and  textual analysis is invaluable. in chapter 4, ramaswamy traces moments in which  the scientific-geographic cartography of india alone was positioned as an object of  veneration. she effectively demonstrates the ultimate failure of this sterile visual  presentation by arguing that although the cartographic image made inroads into  elementary school classrooms, it only entered into indians’ hearts when combined  with the maternal image of Bharat mata. having established the historical lineage of Bharat mata, in the remaining chap- ters, ramaswamy draws our attention to key nationalist figures and the manner in  which their experiences were brought into relief with the image of Bharat mata.  </page> <page sequence="3"> History of Religions 187 Chapter 5 addresses the salient question of why Bharat mata is envisioned as an  essential supplement to the scientific-geographic cartography of the nation. ramas- wamy invokes eve sedgwick’s notion of male homosociality, the idea that women  (and the images of women) serve as conduits to solidify and buttress relationships  between men. ramaswamy argues that in the late colonial period, “barefoot cartog- raphers” (by which she means indian artisans) envisioned the nation as a place in  which “male citizens jostle for power and privilege but also work out their mutual  fascinations, anxieties, and hostilities through and around the exceptional carto- graphed figure of Bharat mata” (180). in chapter 6, ramaswamy narrates the re- lationship between early female nationalists and Bharat mata, tracing the lives of  seldom recognized, but important figures including sarala devi, Chaudhurani née  ghosal, sister nivedita, Bhikhaiji Cama, sarojini naidu, Bina das, kalpana datta,  and Pritilata Waddedar. she closes with an analysis of the pictorial depictions of  the martyrdom of indira gandhi and the challenge that her death issued to Bharat  mata and the territory she represents. The epilogue begins with a pointed analysis  of the historical role of peasants, villagers, and the poor of india as a barometer for  the success or failure of the nationalist project. in sum, ramaswamy’s most recent work is a valuable addition to the grow- ing corpus of scholarship that engages hindu nationalism in late colonial moder- nity and in the contemporary period. it also provides an important socio-political   narrative for scholars who examine art, media, and visual culture in india in the  modern period. The text dialogues with postcolonial theorists and could be used  quite  effectively in advanced undergraduate and graduate seminar courses on mod- ern india, contemporary hinduism, and postcolonial theory to articulate the under- acknowledged importance of visual media in the construction of late colonial and  postcolonial modernities. ramaswamy’s term “barefoot cartographers” merits further consideration. she  uses this term to refer to indian visual artists who propagate the anthropomorphic- sacred form of Bharat mata as a supplement (in the derridean sense that what sup- plements also supplants) to the scientific cartography of the colonial government.  Colonial administrators used the map as a regulative implement “in order to make  land visually legible for rule and resource management and for determining sover- eignty and policing borders” (35). in contrast, ramaswamy’s “barefoot cartogra- phers” superimposed the maternal anthropomorphic-sacred image of the goddess  Bharat mata upon the sterile scientific-geographic image of the map of india (and  even at times replaced the map with Bharat mata) as a means to personalize territory  as a “mother and motherland” worth living, and worth dying for (176). Certainly, ramaswamy is correct in positing the importance of cartography and  the geographic sciences for the colonial enterprise of accruing both knowledge and  power in the service of domination and governance. however, in contrasting this  with “barefoot cartography” (the pictorial products of “barefoot cartographers”),  this term (unwittingly) reifies and reinforces the orientalist mythos of the dichotomy  between barefoot (religious/superstitious) natives and booted (scientific) colonial  powers. in the postcolonial period, in particular, certainly those politicized visual  artists who generate the images of Bharat mata for nationalistic purposes are neither  barefoot nor unaware of the sciences. moreover, this rendering obscures a more  </page> <page sequence="4"> 188 Book Reviews  intriguing question: why does Bharat mata continue to be so culturally important— in the presence of both science and shoes? This terminology seems even more misplaced because it appears to work against  ramaswamy’s larger argument which renders these artisans as sophisticated and  clever subversives, reconfiguring visually what was initially an implement of domi- nation. As she explains, “undoubtedly the barefoot is in contested intimacy with  command cartography, as it dislodges the state’s highly invested map form from  official contexts of production and use and then reembeds it—sometimes to the  point of only faint resemblance—in its own pictorial productions . . . after the fash- ion of so much else in colonial india where the artifacts of empire and science  were simultaneously disavowed and desired, patriotic popular mapmaking takes  on the cartographed form of the nation but also pushes it in directions not intended  for it by either science or state” (35). Thus, might we not conceive of the indian  anthropomorphic-sacred supplement to the attempted colonial commandeering of  the  cartography of india as a brilliant and complex act of resistance to colonial  domination? in a sense, indian artisans acknowledge the colonial interpretation of the car- tography of india in sterile straight lines and grids but refuse to accept it as con- veying the entirety of the nation. instead, like many aspects of hindu religiosity  throughout history, they respond to challenging (and even aggressive) extra-hindu  ideas by appropriating and incorporating them, even substantively altering them to  accommodate them within a hindu worldview. These nationalistic artisans trans- form the sterile product of enlightenment rationality and geographical science (the  cartographic map) into a wholly indian (and predominantly Hindu—another point  that might warrant a more aggressive analysis in the text) symbol of loyalty and  patriotism emboldened by the “feminine” characteristics of love, self-sacrifice, and  service. Perhaps “barefoot” is not the best term to describe those who would ad- ministrate such a careful, clever, political, and above all calculated move with such  extensive historical precedent. amaNda huffer Austin College The Ten Lost Tribes: A World History.
