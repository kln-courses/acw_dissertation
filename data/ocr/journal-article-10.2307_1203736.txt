<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCHARLEMANN, ROBERT P., and OGUTO, GILBERT E. M., eds. God in Language. New York: Paragon House, 1987. xi+224 pp. In 1984, a conference sponsored by the New Ecumenical Research Association was held in Seoul, Korea. The authors of the thirteen essays, most of which were presented at this conference, are from six countries: Israel, the United States, United Kingdom, India, Kenya, and France. The question addressed by each essay is that "of the effect that language as a medium has upon the knowledge of God" (p. viii). The volume is not immune to difficulties endemic to such a collection. In spite of its title, the book is not best read as a sampler of current issues on the issue of God and language: there is no mention of what some today take to be the most important problem in language about God, namely, the gender issue. One might wish also that the editors had exercised leadership regarding inclusive language in general: only five of the thirteen essays indicate sensitivity to this problem. Unevenness in the quality of the essays also detracts from the book's usefulness. Some of the essays explicitly address the question: Asa Kasher's "What Effect Does Language as a Medium Have on Knowledge of God? In a sense none," for example. Kasher linguistically analyzes both methods of justification and refer- ence to argue that something other than language itself justifies our knowledge of God. He concludes by applying the analysis to his own preference for a via negativa in theology. In "Language, Knowledge, and God," Frank R. Harrison III distinguishes dif- ferences in the Eastern and Western "stances" regarding concepts religion, mean- ing, truth, knowledge, and language. He argues that to hold that talk about God is relative to the language "in which such activities are embedded" (p. 29) is not to commit oneself to either Cultural Relativism or Cultural Tyrannicalism. Frederick Ferr6 makes a persuasive case for anthropomorphic discourse-"It is only by affirming anthropomorphic discourse, under constraints, that spirituality can in the end be focused and forwarded by the mind" (p. 185)-in his essay, "In Praise of Anthropomorphism." 134</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Several of the essays approach the question through an analysis of particular texts: Martin Jaffee on the Rabbinic Oral Torah, Francis D'Sa on Saint John's gospel, Robert Scharlemann on Martin Buber's I and Thou, Nona Bolin on Jacques Derrida's use of Martin Heidegger, Michael J. Coughlan on Ludwig Wittgenstein, Charles Courtney on Henry Dumery, Gilbert E. M. Ogutu on the language of the Luo people of Uganda. Two essayists address the question thematically: Frederick Sontag in "Words of Silence: the Context for God" and Shlomo Biderman in "God and Authority." The two responses included in the book offer a taste of what it might mean to surpass the limitations of discrete treatises by sustained dialogue: Lonnie Kliever's critique of Gabriel Vahanian's "God and the Utopianism of Language" and Vahanian's brief rejoinder to Kliever. Kliever foregrounds Vahanian's latest work on the necessary utopianism of God-language for representing human real- ity and faith and asks for more rigorous reflection on the "formal requirements" for speaking about God "in a technological universe of discourse" (p. 211).
