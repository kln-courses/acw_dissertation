Copyright 1 997 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT With the increasing number of air bags being used in vehicles there has been a corresponding increase in the number of occupants injured or even killed due to air bag deployment, particularly under out-of-position conditions. Current publications addressing the dangers of air bag deployment has led to worldwide public uncertainty on the safe use of these passive restraint components. A main goal of the air bag module development must be to balance the out-of-position risks with the overall occupant protection performance to reach the highest biomechanical quality. Further considerations must be given to the development and production costs, quality and styling of the air bag module and steering wheel. Design, function, cost and styling have competing impact during the product development phase. Economic and efficiency factors require new production and manufacturing of systems that use pre-assembled components as assembly groups, such as the so called "high level assemblies." Cooperation of system and module design, testing and numerical simulation experts is required to successfully address these concerns. An existing study of an air bag integrated steering wheel as a component of the entire restraint system shows that a strong integration of the CAD, CAE and testing disciplines is the most methodical and effective procedure for restraint system development. The goal of the study is to show and discuss modern, and above all, effective methods for increasing occupant protection. The emphasis lies on the out-of-position occupants. This study shows the methodology of a development and assessment of a concept for an out-of-position optimized air bag integrated steering wheel. Furthermore, solutions are shown to reduce the out-of- position risks for an air bag integrated steering wheel. The developed solutions are built as functional prototypes. Static deployment tests with a 5th %ile HYBRID III Dummy are performed to analyze and evaluate the effects of the new technology. INTRODUCTION Today the driver air bag is standard equipment for a passenger vehicle in the US. In contrast to Europe, the air bag in the US was introduced as a passive restraint system which had and still has to protect the occupant according to the FMVSS 208 along with the kneebolster and the seat design. At this time, however, the study was conducted with an unbelted occupant. The reason for such a decision from NHTSA was a low belt rate of 20% for occupants. Today the safety potential of an air bag is not in question, with studies showing that 1500 occupants have been saved by the air bag in the last years. Another study of frontal crashes showed an 18% reduction of fatalities due to the air bag and other NHTSA studies showed a reduction of severe injuries to the head, thorax and abdomen [12]. The optimal use of air bags for the ride down of the occupant is only guaranteed if they are fully inflated before contact with the occupant occurs. If the occupant is in contact with the air bag during the unfolding process injuries can occur. These injuries are abrasions, fractures, head injuries and injuries of the inner organs. The situation where the occupant is close to the air bag - or even the worse case - has direct contact with the 1314</page><page sequence="2">module is referred to as out-of-position condition. The possibility of negative side effects from the air bag system in some accident conditions has been known since its introduction to the market. With the rapidly rising number of air bag equipped vehicles, the incidence of accidents with air bag related injuries or fatalities is increasing. Due to the physics, especially small and incorrectly belted occupants have shown the highest risk of severe injuries caused by the interaction with the air bag during its deployment and unfolding process. Press-reports of such accidents, particularly low speed impacts, are the focus today for public discussion of the out-of-position topic. As a consequence, the following demands for the air bag are in discussion: • "depowered air bags" Reduction of the energy of driver - and passenger air bags • "smart air bag technology" An air bag system which is adjusted to the crash severity and occupant position The simple change toward "depowered bags" reduces the safety potential for the in-position occupant with no guarantee for an increased safety potential for out-of-position occupants [1]. The "smart air bag technology" necessitates the development of new sensor technology with reliable detection and decision algorithm. The implementation into the vehicle is time consuming and costly. This demands system knowledge and high innovative technology from the safety system supplier. The aim is to reduce the development time and costs and to be flexible for shifting demands. The development of new solutions should not be a coincidence-product. To reach this goal means to effectively use the available technical and research tools and methods of the system development combined with the product development of the components. The ideal goal must be to develop optimal solutions for a component or the system with no increased cost. That means the supplier has to identify the areas of cost savings and effectiveness of the system in the vehicle. An essential requirement for this isthat the supplier is already included as a development partner during the concept phase. METHODOLOGY Three fundamental departments of the supplier add up to an engineering team for system development: • Concept design (CAD) • Occupant crash simulation (CAE) • Crash testing (crash facility, dummy-, measurement- and film technology, component facility) The CAD department is the link to the product development, however, they have enough capacity to develop product innovations out of ongoing research and development activities. The CAD engineers provide vehicle interior geometry and component design for numerical models to be used by the occupant crash simulation. Furthermore, they provide concepts for test rigs and modifications of serial components of occupant protection systems. The occupant crash simulation develops a parameter matrix of the restraint system components. This allows for a first adjustment of the restraint system to be tested using a sled test facility with high speed measurement, film and video technology. The occupant crash simulation and the crash test department are connected by a close development loop as shown in Figure 1 . Both development tools are well coordinated to efficiently develop the restraint system and to minimize the risks during the development. SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT METHODS - CAD, CAE and crash testing are connected by a close development loop as shown in Figure 1 .

The goal of the occupant crash simulation is to evaluate interesting parameter variations before extensive testing is done. The main focus of the development results from the examined accident type and determined injury mechanism. 1315</page><page sequence="3">The restraint system of the driver side in frontal impacts includes the following components and subsystems. • crossmember with interface to body structure • mounting bracket of steering column • steering column • IP and kneebolster • steering wheel • driver air bag module • floor and toe panel, pedals • seat system (incl. mounting brackets / rails) • seat belt system • A-pillar and roof liners • door panel Independent of the development of the entire restraint system the optimization of one component must always take into account the entire vehicle system. This method of the scientific and systematic overall view of occupant safety is necessary to effectively develop function and cost optimized products. The following describes the principle steps of the development of an air bag integrated steering wheel as a restraint system component beyond the first prototype. 1 . Automotive safety analyses 1 .1 Accident analyses Correlation between injury mechanism and the effect of vehicle subsystems or single restraint system components are the result of the evaluation of accident statistics and test results. 1 .2 Basic requirements All geometry data and characteristic values of the restraint system are determined. This includes all characteristic values of the restraint system which can not be altered, such as dependent geometry data and characteristic values of existing components. 2. Concept fixation First the occupant load limits are determined. This presupposes an extensive, realistic assessment with practicable development solutions based on the scientific expertise of the engineering team. Derived from the first step, the first design concepts are developed. 3. Development The three main departments, occupant crash simulation, CAD and crash testing, develop the component using the development loop shown in Figure 1. The development starts with the occupant crash simulation and design of the first functional samples. 4. Prototyping As a result of the development .prototypes are built which meet or exceed the performance criteria. 5. Product development The performance criteria as well as design hardpoints for the air bag integrated steering wheel are handed over to the product development. The product development uses the numerical models and the test rigs from the concept phase for further refinement. The main task during this phase is the fine tuning of the component as well as the final design for a fully mechanized assembly line. The final prove out and validation of the developed air bag integrated steering wheel takes place in a full scale crash test. OOP - PROBLEMATIC NATURE During a vehicle collision, air bag modules have the task to fully inflate an energy absorbing cushion as quickly as possible before the occupant's forward excursion and subsequently support the occupant. The necessary restraint load is transferred on the occupant using the large area of the air bag. Compared to the seat belt, the restraint load application is essentially reduced. This fact is shown in accident analyses. In the aggregate, the share of head and cervical spine injuries adds up to no more than 10%, and the statistically relevant AIS ratings of these injuries range between 1 and 2, while the proportion of chest injuries among belted occupants varies between 25 and 30%, at AIS ratings between 1 and 3 [10]. This accident analyses confirms known test results. At identical dummy load levels, belt related loads carry a greater injury risk than air bag related loads. [9]. The main task of occupant safety is the minimization of occupant loads during most accident types and to control the localization, the direction and the application area of the restraint load on the occupant to guarantee a high biomechanical quality and to prevent unnecessary injuries caused by the restraint system [3]. The air bag as a component of the restraint system has the potential, in cooperation with the seat belt, to fulfill this task. The problematic nature has to be analyzed and evaluated before the requirements can be defined. How can the out-of-position (OOP) or Inflation Induced Injury (I3) be defined? OOP describes a situation where the occupant is positioned in the deployment space of the air bag and therefore an uncommon interaction between the head, neck and thorax region and the air bag cushion and module cover can be seen. The direct contact between 1316</page><page sequence="4">the occupant and the module cover is referred to as the worst case scenario. Severe injuries or even fatalities can be the consequence of this interaction. OOP situations in real world accidents can have following causes: • delayed ignition of the air bag during the vehicle collision • close by seating position • forward movement of the occupant due to pre- impact braking What type of loading mechanism can be seen in OOP situations? Loading mechanism during the contact phase under OOP conditions have been broken down by Horsch et al. into "punchouť and "membrane loading" phenomena [4]. Punchout occurs in an early phase of the inflation, when the module swells because of the deploying bag until only a small portion of the bag has escaped from the module. Membrane loading denotes the phase when the fabric wraps around a body region as the bag becomes full, thereby exerting a relatively distributed force on the occupant. A third mechanism related with OOP injuries, the so called "bag slap" [11,13] occurs when the occupant is struck by a small but rapidly moving portion of the bag. Even if this effect does not result in critical injuries it can cause skin abrasions or eye injuries. The following injury criteria are selected and further evaluated: • Viscous Criterion (VC, thorax) • Neck Extension Moment • HIC OUT -OF-POSITION (OOP) ANALYSIS PRELIMINARY STUDY - A preliminary study was conducted by Malczyk and Adomeit [5]. This study analyzed the air bag folding pattern as a means for injury reduction for OOP occupants. Static OOP tests were carried out with driver air bag modules mounted to a rigid test rig and folded either according to the PF- or LF-pattern. A Hybrid III small female was placed on a seat in front of the module with two main test configurations: "chest centered on module" and "forehead centered on module" with varying separations from the module ranging from 0 to 100 mm. The test setup for the configuration "chest centered on module" is shown in Figure 2; Figure 3 shows the test setup for the configuration "forehead centered on module". Figure 2 : Test setup for configuration "chest centered on module" Figure 3: Test setup for configuration "forehead centered on module" The following main conclusions have been drawn from this study. For the configuration "chest centered on module" values of all relevant injury criteria for the chest and the neck were significantly lower with the PF- pattern. For the configuration "forehead centered on module" neck loadings were lower with the PF-pattern In almost all cases except for neck tension and extension moment at separations of 0 mm and 20 mm. The geometry of the module cover tear seam was found to have negative influence here. Cosmetic markings applied to the dummy's face left far less smeared remains on the P-folded bag In comparison to the conventional folding. This indicates a reduced relative motion between the bag fabric and the skin during inflation. Tests conducted until now concentrated on extreme OOP configurations, with direct contact of parts of the body with the module cover. These configurations are based on the assumption of an unbelted occupant. It is certainly feasible, however, to imagine OOP scenarios with restrained occupants, although reliable information is not available with case figures or the distances between vehicle occupants and the air bag module [4,6]. In this sense, the possible configurations of occupant - module studied in OOP tests should include not only the "worst case position" aspect, but also greater separations between dummy and module. The tables 1 and 2 provide details on the measured biomechanical loads (VC, neck extension moment, HIC, bold values indicate exceeding of injury threshold). For evaluation of occupant loading the scaled lARVs (Injury Assessment Reference Value) for the small female 1317</page><page sequence="5">Hybrid III given in [6] and [7] were applied. Calculation of the Viscous Criterion (VC) took place in accordance with the scaling formula presented by Mertz [8].

Regarding the measured injury criteria, the following conclusions for future developments can be drawn to furthermore reduce OOP occupant loads: • Air bag module design concept to be adjusted to OOP condition (priority folding pattern). • Distribute OOP loads to sufficient occupant body parts and mass. • A "minimum distance" between occupant and air bag module of 30 to 40 mm must be provided. SOLUTION APPROACHES - In order to reach optimal occupant protection the component function has to be developed from the entire restraint system point of view. To reach this goal the performance of the restraint system must not be lowered for the majority of cases to gain performance for the minority. Taking that into account, the following fundamental solution approaches are possible: 1 . Energy reduction of the air bag or "depowered air bags" Requirement: - reduction only in case of OOP configuration (advanced sensor system) Examples: - dual stage inflator - sensor system to detect accident severity - sensor system to detect occupant position 2. Optimized occupant load and load distribution on the occupant The ideal solution is an adjustable restraint system which can be controlled during the collision. Technically such a restraint system necessitates an inflator with an adjustable mass flow during the gas generation and a corresponding sensor system. On the assumption that the injury risk for the occupant is a result of partial overload, the demand for the solution approach is specified as follows: =&gt; Reduction of occupant loads during air bag inflation and OOP conditions without lowering the occupant protection during in-position conditions using today's technology. That means that the air bag performance and function is unchanged during all possible accident types. All requirements regarding the restraint system such as air bag inflation time, air bag volume and energy absorbing characteristics of the air bag are adjusted to optimize the restraint system for in-position conditions. Derived from the OOP analysis and the solution approach analysis the following requirement for the air bag performance is specified: =&gt; Realization of a "minimum distance" between occupant and air bag module in all accident types through the retraction of the air bag module. DEVELOPMENT OF A RETRACTING MODULE The preceding analyses admit the conclusion that optimized design solutions can essentially contribute to reduce OOP risks. In order to retract an air bag module it must be accelerated quickly over the necessary distance. 1318</page><page sequence="6">The following options are possible: 1 . Passive retracting module - passive PRM The module is retracted by the reaction forces during the cover opening and deployment of the air bag in a direction toward the steering column axis. 2. Active retracting module - active PRM The retraction of the module is completed before the cover opening. To retract the module, the energy from the inflator gas escaping or a separate energy source is used. A separate energy source must be adjusted to the inflator ignition and the complexity increases as the reliability decreases. Therefore the goal must be to use the available energy of the inflator. Before the product development can begin the realization of the selected concepts must be proven. TEST REQUIREMENTS - During the development of an air bag integrated steering wheel, numerous requirements of components of the restraint system as well as the entire restraint system must be taken into account, especially the peculiarities of the air bag integration and the retracting module. The main requirements to be addressed are listed in the following: 1 . Restraint System and Components • FMVSS201 (ECE-R21) • FMVSS 203 (ECE-R12) • FMVSS 208 (ECE-R94) 2. Design • Environmental tests (includes the steering wheel) • DOT, BAM (air bag and inflator) 3. Retracting Module • Guaranteed fixation of the module in the initial and retracted position against head impact, reaction forces and misuse. • OOP optimized module concept (PF-pattern, design of module regarding optimized deployment trajectory of air bag) 4. Generic requirements • Availability of developed solution (long / short term) • Low cost (development and product) • Flexible design VALIDATION - Before the product development begins, the realization of the retracting module concept regarding the function must be proven. In the first step prototypes are developed which represent the demanded function and can be used in static OOP tests as described in [5]. To compare the test results the same components are used as in the earlier study and the same test setup. TESTS CONDUCTED - The first test series is used to verify the possible occupant load reduction under OOP conditions using a passive retracting module. The following tests were selected to be conducted with the retracting module. 1 . Configuration "chest centered on module" Separation 0 mm and 50 mm 2. Configuration "forehead centered on module" Separation 0 mm Each test is conducted twice. The idea is to use the reaction forces during the cover opening and deployment of the air bag acting in the direction of the steering column axis, as an energy source to retract the module. The usable force is only available during the cover opening phase because it is the sum of inertia forces from the generated gas mass, the cover and the air bag fabric. The measurable reaction forces are in direct context with the characteristics of the inflator mass flow. The available air bag steering wheel is modified to allow an unrestrained deformation of the module mounting. In order to hold the module in its initial position, two deformable brackets represent the mounting of the module to the steering wheel. The necessary energy absorption behavior of the deformable brackets was determined through an analyses of measured steering wheel reaction forces during a static air bag deployment test. In accordance with this analysis, simple deformable brackets have been developed and integrated in the air bag steering wheel. The deformable bracket is shown in Figure 4. Steel with a thickness of 1 mm was used to built the brackets. The maximum possible deformation of the brackets is 45 mm. The measured deformation force of one deformable bracket during a static compression test is shown in Figure 5. The possible energy absorption is approx. 36 Nm with two deformable brackets used as the module mounting. Figure 6 shows the mounted air bag module used for the configuration "chest centered on module". The same setup was used for the configuration "forehead centered on module". 1319</page><page sequence="7">Figure 4: Deformable brackets to mount air bag module on steering wheel r cum • .sa- - .... ; ; j • . • • e j . •,4m- &gt; . . . &gt;••••• •:• • • •,••- ļ - . :• - •: : :• - •: :• - * - - ♦ ■.a«- &gt;••••&amp; : ; . š . . ý . . 9.X9-1 - : - ; : » - * j m ' ai.» ' li.a 4.« C Cm] Figure 5: Deformation force of one deformable bracket during static compression test Figure 6: Test setup "chest centered on module" with deformable module mounting brackets TEST RESULTS - "Chest centered on module" - During the tests with 0 mm separation between occupant and module the top bracket deformation starts directly after the cover opening at approx. 5 ms after air bag ignition. The deformation is finished after 3 ms. The bottom bracket deformation starts at approx. 10 ms after air bag ignition. The end of the deformation can not be seen due to the air bag coverage of this area. The entire deformation distance was used in both tests. The air bag uses the available area caused by the module retraction and the region behind the upper steering wheel rim for deployment. During the tests with 50 mm separation between occupant and module the top bracket deformation starts shortly after the cover opening at approx. 7 ms after air bag ignition. The deformation is finished after 4 ms. The bottom bracket deformation starts at approx. 16 ms after air bag ignition. The end of the deformation can not be seen due to the air bag coverage of this area. The deformation of the top bracket was 35 mm and the deformation of the bottom bracket was 15 mm. Both brackets have not used the entire available deformation distance. The air bag uses the available area caused by the deformation of the top bracket and the region behind the upper steering wheel rim for deployment. Table 3 and Figure 7 show the results for the VC and neck extension moment (bold values indicate exceeding of injury threshold) compared between the L-folding pattern (LF), the P-folding pattern (PF), and the P- folding pattern with the retracting module (PF / PRM).

TEST RESULT SUMMARY - "Chest centered on module" - The test configuration "chest centered on module" with the PF-pattern and the retracting module showed a significant reduction of the viscous criterion VC compared to the LF-pattern and the PF-pattern without the retracting module. With 0 mm separation the reduction was 26% and with 50 mm separation the reduction was 20%. With 0 mm separation all air bag module configurations exceeded the IARV, however, both tests with the retracting module resulted in VC values slightly above and under the IARV. The test results with the LF-pattern far exceeded the IARV for the neck extension moment in all tests. The test results with PF-pattern remained far under the IARV for the neck extension moment in all tests. This benefit could not be increased with the retracting module. The neck extension moment in these tests increased slightly, however, they remained far under the IARV of 31 Nm. "Forehead centered on module" - The test configuration "forehead centered on module" with the PF-pattern and the retracting module showed a significant reduction of the neck extension moment and HIC values compared to the PF-pattern without the retracting module. However, the neck extension moment with the retracting module is slightly higher than with the LF-pattern but remains 30% under the IARV. The increase in neck extension moment for the PF- pattern compared to the LF-pattern can be traced to the interaction of the folding scheme with the tear-open mechanism of the module cover. Analysis of the high- speed films reveals that the torn-open cover becomes wedged in between the deploying air bag and the dummy head situated in front of the module. When this cover finally slides away from the dummy chin and then flips downward, the potential energy of the bag portion located beneath the cover is suddenly transferred to the underside of the chin. As a result of the different bag folding scheme, this wedging of the module door was not so pronounced with the LF-pattern and the rearward rotation of the dummy head was likewise gentler [5]. This phenomenon was mitigated when using the retracting module and the PF-pattern. The neck extension moment with the PF-pattern and the retracting module was decreased by 25% compared to the tests without the retracting module and the PF-pattern. Furthermore, tear seam design may reduce the neck extension moment. All tests showed HIC values far below the IARV, however, the test with the PF-pattern and the retracting module showed a 20% reduction of the HIC value compared to the test with the PF-pattern and without the retracting module. 1323</page><page sequence="11">Figure 1 1 : Comparison of air bag deployment and occupant kinematics for PF-pattern with and without PRM, "forehead centered on module", 0 mm separation 1324</page><page sequence="12">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION The effective usage of available scientific and systematic tools in the restraint system development requires methodical procedures. This study describes the methodical procedure to develop an air bag integrated steering wheel in order to optimize occupant protection balanced against OOP risks. The close cooperation between the concept design, occupant crash simulation, crash testing and product development is emphasized. This guarantees the development of a restraint system component from the system point of view. The evaluation of the OOP topic, analysis of preliminary OOP studies and a methodical solution approach lead to the development of a new component for an air bag integrated steering wheel. The development of a passive retracting air bag module - PRM - was achieved during the methodical procedure and performance of OOP tests. Compared to OOP tests in [5] the usage of the retracting module - PRM showed a significant reduction for the configuration "chest centered on module" for the viscous criterion VC. The value for the neck extension moment was slightly increased, however, it remained far below the IARV. For the configuration "forehead centered on module" HIC value was reduced by 20% with the usage of the retracting module - PRM. The neck extension moment was reduced by 25%, however, the value was slightly higher compared to the LF-pattern. It remains to be noticed that the energy absorption of the deformable module brackets was on a very low level. Increasing that level and producing a more even deformation for the module shows another safety potential of the passive retracting module for OOP conditions. An additional advantage of the retracting module is the use of the mechanism to satisfy the head impact standard (FMVSS 201, ECE-R21). The mechanism is then functioning as a crash can implemented in the steering wheel. These features included in an air bag integrated steering wheel in addition to the P-foid allow a seamless design of the steering wheel and a smaller package to gain more available distance for the retracting module. In the future, the active retracting module may furthermore result in reduced occupant loads compared to the passive retracting module due to a mitigated punchout effect. The retraction of the module before the swelling and opening of the module cover may result in reduced punchout loads on the occupant. Due to an optimized function for all occupant positions, the retracting module concept guarantees a safety potential increase for OOP occupants and no reduction for in-position occupants. In summary, the test results showed the effectiveness of the retracting module concept - PRM and the analyses admit the conclusion that optimized design solutions can essentially contribute to reduce OOP risks. The present study suggests that the use of the retracting module - PRM - leads to load reductions for OOP occupants. For the foreseeable future further developments regarding air bag module design, sensor systems and inflator technology show an increase for the safety potential of restraint systems ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank H.-D.
