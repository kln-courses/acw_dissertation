<plain_text><page sequence="1">Traditional and Personal Elements in Aristotle's Religion* W. J. VERDENIUS THERE is a special reason why Aristotle deserves a place on the pro- gramme of this congress. Our general theme, "Tradition and Personal Achievement," may be interpreted in two different ways. We may try to determine the proportion of these two factors in the works of the ancients. This proportion shows a large scale of variations, from the predominance of the traditional element to the predominance of the personal element. But there is also another scale of variations, which extends from unconscious adoption of traditional views to con- scious criticism. It is from this point of view that I will discuss some ideas of Aristotle. Criticism of traditional views is to be found in the works of most of the Greek thinkers, including the work of Aristotle. But what distinguishes his attitude towards tradition from that of his predecessors is the fact that he seems to be the first to take up a definite position with regard to tradition as a whole.' Other thinkers had confined their atten- tion to special elements of tradition, such as some theory or some popular belief which conflicted with their own view, but they did not reflect on the value of tradition as such. It was Aristotle who discovered tradition, i.e. who realized that tradition as such, irrespective of its special con- tents, confronts us with a problem. This problem is, whether tradition has a value simply because it is tradition. Aristotle attached a value to tradition as such, because in his opinion tradition embodies a real experience.2 He argues that we must consider a problem not only from a scientific point of view but also in the light of current opinions: "for with a true view all the data harmonize. "3 With- out any comment he replaces the expression 'ra'. ey0'Levm by rak irmp- xov'r, and he could do so, because he seriously believed that current opinion always expresses some real fact. "It is impossible," he writes, "that the views held by many nmen and men of old should be entirely mistaken."' Aristotle does not put the question why the current view is likely to be right. An indirect answer to this question may be deduced from the combination of three other passages: "Men have a sufficient na- tural instinct for what is true, and usually do arrive at the truth," "Every man has some contribution to make to the truth," "There is this to be said for the Many. Each of them by himself may not be of a good * A paper read before the Third International Congress of Classical Studies in London in September z9gs.

This is the reason why the Many are also better judges of music and the writings of poets: some appreciate one part, some another, and all together appreciate all."5 We may add the conclusion that a common opinion, wherein a great number of such indi- vidual approaches to the truth is seen to concur, is likely to be right, because in such a case man's natural aptitude for attaining the truth has found a mutual confirmation. The reliability of such a current view becomes still greater, if it is also a tradition, i.e. if it reaches back to ancient times. In the passage just quoted the expressions "many men" and "men of old" are used in one breath. Aristotle sometimes stresses the antiquity of a traditional view to such a degree that he makes the impression of regarding this an- tiquity as a value in itself.6 The question why the antiquity of a view should be a guarantee of its truth, is not answered by him, but in this case, too, we may deduce the answer from another passage. "What is long established seems akin to what exists by nature".7 Accordingly, the antiquity of a tradition is a justification of its existence and thus a guarantee of its truth. In addition to its antiquity and the large number of its adherents there is a third factor which establishes the value of tradition. "We are bound to pay some regard to the long past," writes Aristotle, "for almost everything has been discovered already."8 This means that the value of tradition lies in the fact that it cannot be surpassed. There is no real progress in the history of thought, but, as Aristotle puts it, "the same ideas recur in men's minds not once or twice but again and again. " The question why there is such an eternal return in human thought is not answered by Aristotle except in an indirect way. Speaking about poli- tical institutions he writes: "The same institutions have been invented in the course of the years on a number of different occasions - indeed an indefinite number. Necessity itself, we may reasonably suppose, will steadily be the mother of indispensable inventions."10 If there is an analogy between the recurrence of these indispensable inventions and the recurrence of fundamental ideas, there must be a kind of necessity behind the latter, too. This force which causes the same ideas to appear again and again would probably have been called "Nature" by Aristotle.'" If this assumption is correct, the value of tradition is based on Nature in three respects: tradition starts from a natural instinct for what is true, its antiquity shows that it exists by nature, and its recurrent cha- racter is determined by nature. S7</page><page sequence="3">This natural authority of tradition does not imply that Aristotle feels committed to it in every respect. After saying that "almost everything has been discovered already," he continues, "though some of the things discovered have not been co-ordinated, and some, though known, are not put into practice. "12 Accordingly, the only thing Aristotle holds himself entitled to add to the views handed down by tradition is some co-ordination. This co-ordination should not be regarded as something entirely new but rather as the clarification of a meaning already inherent in tradition itself. The procedure of co-ordination and clarification is described by Aristotle as follows: "From statements that are true but not clearly expressed, as we advance, clearness will also be attained, if at every stage we adopt more scientific positions in exchange for the customary confused statements.13 This exchange does not imply an essential transformation of the traditional views but only a supplement, as appears from another passage: "We ought to take over and use what has already been adequately expressed before us, and confine ourselves to attempting to discover what has hitherto been omitted."'4 Aristotle even deems it his duty to establish the traditional views by solving their apparent contradictions, so that their claims to the truth may become manifest: "We must, as in all other cases, set the observed facts before us and, after first discussing the difficulties, go on to prove, if possible, the truth of all the common opinions .., or, failing this, of the greater number and the most authoritative; for if we both remove the diffic- ulties and leave the common opinions standing, we shall have proved the case sufficiently. "15 The difficulties are removed by Aristotle by pointing out the relative limits of the conflicting views: "If what is said is true in one sense but not true in another, both the contradictory views stand good. "16 It is well-known that this method of co-ordination, clarification, and reconciliation has led Aristotle both to admirable and to deplorable results. On the one hand, he is never tired of penetrating into the real meaning of even the most obscure and strange ideas, always viewing them as serious attempts to arrive at the truth,7 on the other hand, he does not shrink from the boldest distortions and the grossest misrepresentations 18 This deformation of history often seems to contradict his intellectual honesty'9 but it should rather be explained as the inevitable consequence of a tragic conflict, a conflict between Aristotle's belief in Nature and his belief in himself. If, as we have seen, tradition is a special manifesta- tion of Nature and if Nature is always looking for the best,20 tradition has to be proved right anyway. If, on the other hand, any belief, tinme-</page><page sequence="4">honoured though it may be, has to vindicate itself before the tribunal of reason, Aristotle had to maintain his own position. The result was a constant wavering between his respect for Nature and his respect for his own reason. When it came to the point, however, Reason triumphed over Nature, and the traditional views were either rejected or adapted or simply ignored. But in none of these cases does Aristotle plead guilty of being disloyal to Nature. So he does not seem te be conscious of the conflict at all. It is therefore that I spoke of "a tragic conflict." The three possibilities which I have mentioned, rejection, adaptation, and ignoring, not only determine Aristotle's attitude towards traditional views in the field of philosophy but also in the field of religion. An example of outright rejection is the following criticism: "The school of Hesiod and all the theologians thought only of what was plausible to themselves, and had no regard to us. For, asserting the first principles to be gods and born of gods, they say that the beings which did not taste of nectar and ambrosia became mortal; and clearly they are using words which are familiar to themselves, yet what they have said about the very application of these causes is above our comprehension. For if the gods taste of nectar and ambrosia for their pleasure, these are in no wise the causes of their existence; and if they taste them to maintain their exist- ence, how can gods who need food be eternal? But into the subtleties of the mythologists it is not worth our while to inquire seriously. "21 In other cases, however, Aristotle took the trouble to bring mythology into harmony with his own doctrine. He even interprets Zeus as a symbol of the unmoved mover: quoting the passage from the Iliad in which Zeus defies the other gods to fasten a golden rope to the heavens and to pull him down, he remarks: "Homer's words would seem appro- priate... for that which is entirely unmovable cannot be moved by anything."22 The fact that Zeus sometimes moves from Olympus to Mount Ida is simply ignored by Aristotle. But he does not ignore every religious tradition that is inconsistent with his own doctrine. It was easier to suppress Nature in philosophy than in religion. Greek religion seems to have had such an impact on Aris- totle's mind that even into his ideal state he admits such elements as did not conform to his own moral standards. He writes: "We must also prevent the exhibition of indecent pictures and the performance of indecent plays. It should therefore be the duty of the governmenit to prohibit all statuary and painting which portrays any sort of indecent action. An exception may, however, be made for the festivals of deities where even the use of scurrility is licensed by the law. "23 This quotation shows that</page><page sequence="5">Aristotle adopts a much more liberal attitude towards Greek religious tradition than Plato.24 Strictly speaking, however, it was not a question of liberality, but, as I have already suggested, of an unconscious conflict. Aristotle takes it to be self-evident that the traditional gods should be worshipped,28 al- though the common representations of these gods flatly contradicted his most fundamental convictions. The Aristotelian god has no need of action, since he is his own end.28 AII ordinaryactions are unworthy of him, so that the only activity allowed to him is self-contemplation.27 But the traditional gods constantly direct their activities to other things than themselves. Nevertheless Aristotle does not call into question these activities. He accepts, for instance, divine providence without any dis- cussion: "He who exercises his reason and cultivates it seems to be both in the best state of mind and most dear to the gods. For if the gods have any care for human affairs, as they are thought to have, it will be rea- sonable both that they should delight in that which is best and most akin to them (i.e. reason) and that they should reward those who love and honour this most, as caring for the things that are dear to them and acting both rightly and nobly. And that all these attributes belong most of all to the philosopher is manifest. He, therefore, is the dearest to the gods. "28 It has been supposed that Aristotle here simply reports a traditional belief, viz. the belief that the gods reward the man who honours them, without committing himself to it.29 But the fact that he connects this tradition with his own conception of human reason as the element of man which is most akin to God, shows that he attached a real value to it.30 On the other hand, there is some uncertainty in his words, for the providence of the gods is posited in a hypothetical and impersonal form: "If the gods have any care for human affairs as they are thought to have (Wcmep 8oxeZ)." The same uncertainty appears in another passage: "If there is any gift of the gods to men, it is reasonable that happiness should be god-given, and most surely god-given of all human things inasmuch as it is the best. But this question would perhaps be more ap- propriate to another inquiry; happiness seems, however, even if it is not god-sent but comes as a result of virtue and some process of learning or training, to be among the most godlike things. "31 This is perhaps the most significant passage in Aristotle's theology. For the other inquiry to which he refers does not exist, and I doubt whether he ever seriously intended to devote himself to such an inquiry. On the one hand, his conviction of the natural character of tradition prevented him from 6o</page><page sequence="6">dismissing the common belief in divine providence; on the other hand, he intuitively felt that it was incompatible with his own idea of god in its strictest form. I have added the words "in its strictest form", because Aristotle did not always stick to his most rigorous definitions. In such moments he may have vaguely thought of a kind of reconciliation between his god and the traditional gods. In his strictest form the Aristotelian god is the final cause of the world, resting in his own sphere and acting on the world as a model of perfection. But the final cause sometimes develops an efficient aspect, e.g. in the following passage: "We must consider also in which of two ways the nature of the universe possesses the good and the highest good, whether as something separate and by itself, or as the order of the parts. Probably in both ways, as an army does; for its good is found both in its order and in its leader, and more in the latter; for he does not depend on the order but it depends on him. "132 The image of the leader shows that the principle of order not only transcends the world as a model of perfection, but also pervades the world as a force exercised by the supreme power.33 Consequently, the Aristotelian god, who is the ultimate source of the good, brings about the order of the world, primarily as the object of the world's desire, but secondarily as a regulative force.34 If this assumption is correct, we can also explain the fact that Aristotle sometimes equates "Nature" and "God", e.g. in the utterance "God and Nature create nothing that has not its use."35 Nature as the immanent force which underlies the order of the world is divine,36 and may be called God in so far as it is the efficient aspect of God. This efficient aspect, however, is not the essential nature of God, but a secondary aspect which connects him with the world. From this point of view Nature has a mediating function, transmitting the perfection of God to the world.37 Now the Greeks called a divine being which has an inter- mediate character a 84Lpwv.38 Aristotle adopted this term when he wrote: "Dreams are not sent by God... but they are 8mqL6vLa, for Nature is A0L,uoVLx, but not ltoc. "13 He uses the same term when ascribing inspiration to "something 8aL,u6vtov. "40 It is true that Aristotle tries to explain dreams and inspiration from natural causes,41 but this does not imply that he did not take their divine character seriously.42 For natural causes are at the same time divine causes,43 even if they pertain to normal phenomena. Speaking about the question whether we can become good "by nature" Aristotle remarks: "That which be- longs to Nature evidently does not depend on us, but as a result of some 6I</page><page sequence="7">divine causes is present in those who are truly fortunate."4" From a modem point of view inspiration may be called a supernatural pheno- menon. But in Aristotle's view it is natural as well as divine. Accord- ingly, when he says that "poetry is inspired by God" (9v&amp;eoq) or that some utterances of the ancients are "divinely said" (4sL&amp;c),4" we have no reason to doubt that he is speaking from his own conviction. In all these cases God makes his influence felt in the natural world. We may now venture to ask whether Aristotle may not have inter- preted the traditional gods as operating through Nature in a way ana- logous to that of his own god. There is an interesting passage in which he praises the ancients for regarding the primary substances which act as the unmoved movers of the planets, as gods, and only criticizes the fact that they imagined these gods in the form of men.4" This seems to show that Aristotle took the traditional gods to be imperfect representations of the urunmoved movers of the planets. These unmoved movers are divine beings of the highest order, they lie beyond the outermost motion of the heavens and live the best and most self-sufficient of lives.47 So they belong to the same sphere of being as the supreme unnmoved mover. Aristotle does not define their mutual relations, but he probably ima- gined sonme kind of subordination of the unmoved movers as the minor gods to the one unmoved mover as the highest god.48 The planets themn- selves are also divine beings, partaking of life and action.49 The last fact, their action, distinguishes them from their unmoved movers and con- nects them with the sphere of Nature. Now the unmoved movers are primarily final causes, but just as the supreme god, they may have an efficient aspect. In that case the planets are the visible manifestations of the gods and it is through the mnovements of the planets that the gods are operating in this world.50 We are now treading on dangerous ground. It has been rightly remark- ed that "Aristotle does not even say, as he might easily have done, that these visible beings serve as mediators between the highest God and man."'51 There is no trace of astrological speculation in his work. On the other hand, Aristotle lived in a time when astral religion was getting a stronger hold in Greece. Plato took the movements of the heavenly bodies to be the most obvious proof of the existence of the gods.52 The author of the Epinomis argued that the heavenly bodies are either gods or images of gods fashioned by these gods themselves, that they should be worshipped with higher honours than all others, and that these other gods may be put anywhere provided they conform to the system of astronomy.53 Aristotle himself explained the origin of religion from two 62</page><page sequence="8">sources, the prophetic power of the soul in dreams and the contemplation of the movements of the heavenly bodies.54 He even derives the word to6 from &amp;6w , "to run, " "to move. "55 It maybe concluded that in Aristotle's eyes the heavenly bodies are the most divine beings of which man has some experience. The question remains why he attached, as we have seen, such a special importance to the planets. An indirect answer to this question may be found in a passage in which the complex movements of the planets are illustrated by the complex movements of the living beings on earth.56 Aristotle may have attached a deeper meaning to this analogy and have regarded the movements of the planets as the most impressive manifestation of a divine life pervading our world and some- how connected with our life. It should once more be emphasized that if Aristotle had any idea of possible connections between traditional religion and his own theology, it must have been a very vague idea. Why did he not make any stronger attempts at reconciliation, or if he realized that this would be impossible, why did he not reject the traditional gods altogether? 7 I have explained his respect for tradition from his respect for Nature. But from what source came this respect for Nature? It has often been suggested that the contradictions in Aristotle's system ultimately derive from the conflict between two forces in his mind, Platonism and empiricism.58 But his respect for Nature is something more than empiricism: it is not only a belief in the observation of nature, but also, and in the first place, a belief in Nature itself. This belief in Nature was an inheritance from Plato, and the main conflict was not between Platonism and something else, but between the different aspects of Platonism as they were devel- oped by Aristotle.59 Plato firmly believed in the unity of Nature,60 but this did not compel him to accept anything that presented itself as natural. What saved him from becoming a mere naturalist was his idea of a hier- archical structure of reality, everything striving after some model of perfection of which it is an image, an approximative imitation.61 Accord- ingly, Plato could do justice to tradition and current opinion by giving them their proper place on the scale of being, and this usually was such a low position that they were practically rejected. Aristotle adopted the idea of the unity of Nature, but he interpreted this unity in such a radical way that he could not accept the idea of hierarchical imitation.62Tra- dition and current opinion now had to be admitted to the full status of naturalness and as such could not easily be rejected. On the other hand, Aristotle stood by the Platonic principle that only the reasonable can be fully true and real. The result was, as we have seen, a constant struggle between the claims of Nature and the claims of Reason. 63</page><page sequence="9">A further result of Aristotle's rejection of imitation as a principle of differentiation was the complete separation of God and the world. The Platonic god is a self-sufficient and transcendent being, but the idea of imitation enabled Plato to translate the perfection of the highest god into the providence of the lower gods.63 In Aristotle's system, as we have seen, there is no -eal synthesis of divine transcendence and divine providence. We should not blame Aristotle for this failure, for it may be doubted whether such a synthesis is possible at all. At any rate, Plato's solution, especially his introduction of the Demiurge, makes a somewhat artificial impression. In this respect Aristotle's inconsistency is more realistic and more human.

His conclusion from antiquity to naturalness seems to be a special application of the belief that "Nature does nothing in vain". What exists for a long time, does not exist in vain, so it exists by nature. 64</page><page sequence="10">8 Pol. 1 264 a2 Xp?i 7pottv -rT 7?o)Xi, Xp6v ... - &amp;vrm yap aXc&amp;v dSp7ML. 9 Cael. 270 b g9 ov yr&amp;p &amp;nroc, ou8 8 &amp;?W X &amp; p7rCLP&amp;XK 8SCL VO[L(tCLV 'r&amp;i mc&amp;r&amp; &amp;(LKVteCLOxL c6Zx; P_E;a&amp;c.

It will be clear that I cannot agree with J. B. McDiarmid, Harr. Stud. 6i (19S3), p. 86, who maintains that 'Aristotle is not interested in historical facts as such at all. He is constructing his own system of philosophy, and his predecessors are of interest to him only insofar as they furnish material to this end". Cherniss' con- clusion which this quotation claims to summarize, is much more qualified (cf.

But "to have a ct)Xoq" presupposes a permanent need; this is absent from the act of qcthtv, which has a more incidental character. Similarly, man and God cannot "be cpLoL", because their disparity is too great (E.N. ii8 b32). But this does not imply that incidental (PLIE should be impossible. Aristotle expressly admits the possibility of y)da between God and man (E.E. 1238 bi8), and only adds (b27): 2 Ycotov y&amp;p et T'L kyxoo (-I 'r&amp; 4E 6'rL ouX 61xoEwo &amp;VT-Lq0Xz r LptXe!t-tc.

But Aristotle does not exclude &amp;VLtcpLXelv but only 6 ?oEwo &amp;.vrTLpetv (cf. E.N. 1i 63 b 1 -S). The only remarkable thing is that Aristotle mentions the fact that God is too perfect to think of anything else beside himself as showing that the self-sufficient man cannot be completely like God (E.E. 124S bi6), but not as proving that God cannot 97eplv. so This seems to be recognized by Dirlmeier himself, pp. s98-9: "So hat hier die populare Formulierung des 'do ut des' eine einzigartige Sublimierung erfahren.

But this can hardly be the meaning of 8Lta oi3-rov, which shows that order is effected by the leader. D. J. Allan, The Philosophy of Aristotle (Oxford, I952), p. i 19, remarks: 'it is not God but the good which thus pervades all being." But Aristotle speaks of "the good and the highest good"; the latter cannot be immanent in the universe, so that the term IXCL (all) should not be taken in the strict sense of "contains'. Cf. a8-9 (6 &amp;v0pc7rLvoq vo5q) IX..... Tr6 &amp;pLOtov, 6v &amp;o 'ri, which clearly shows that God is the source of the good. al The assumption of an efficient aspect of a secondary character in the Aristotelian god has also been made by the later Peripatetic school. Theophrastus (Met. 6 ai) speaks of the unmoved mover as 7rckvrc v&amp; &amp;pLac otaPouMtvov. In an Arabic excerpt of the pseudo- Aristotelian treatise On the Virtues of the Soul published by S. Pines, Arch. d'hist. doctr. et litt. du moyen age 23 (I956), pp. 5-43, it is argued that God's care of the world is subor- dinate to his care of his own perfection, and Alexander of Aphrodisias (Apor. II 21, p. 66, 17 Br.) seems to have interpreted the providence of God in the same way (cf. Pines, pp. 25-27). 'These views are probably coloured by Platonic and Stoic ideas, but they may have been *</page><page sequence="13">partly suggested by some indications in the works of Aristotle himself. That he did not conceive of the unmoved mover as a purely final cause also appears from the fact that he assumes the unmoved mover to be in contact with the world (Phys. 267 b8, Gen. corr. 322 b2 I). Met. 1074 b3 the divine is said to enclose (rcpt&amp;Xetv) the whole world, which seems to be impossible for a strictly transcendent being. Cf. Gen. corr. 3 36 b3 1 uveUV)dP(acs 'r6 8ov 6 ft6q. Met. 983 ag Aristotle assigns aop?m to God, i.e. knowledge of the causes of existing things (whereas I o74 b iS ff. it is argued that God's thought cannot have any object but himself). It seems to me that this idea must have meant something more to Aristotle than a popular phrase (as is assumed by Ross, ad loc.).

But on the one hand, the idea of God as a self-centred being acting on the world as its final cause already appears in an early work such as the E.E., cf. 1245 b 18 (#c6;) PkXtTLOV e ?kre &amp;XXo 'rL voetv 7ocp' OtCr6&lt; ocsrr6v, 1249 bi4 ou yap &amp;7rxtxxrtLXr &amp;pXwv 6 ?r5 &amp;dcX' o5 hexo ^ 9pp6vraLt; 7w rrcLkdTt. On the other hand, the providence of the gods is mentioned in a passage of the N.E. (quoted supra, n. 28) which is com- monly taken to be much later than the E.E. See further the review of Nolte's book by A. Mansion, Tijdschr. v. Philos. 7 (1945), pp. 127-140. This does not imply that we should exclude the possibility of any development in Aristotle's religious thought. But our data are too scanty to trace such a development. W. Lameere, Ant.Cl. I8 (1949), 279-324, tries to show that Aristotle orginally accepted, but later abandoned, the idea of a genius accompanying man during his life. But the evidence he adduces is not sufficient to draw such a conclusion: fr. 193 is suspect, Gen.an. 76I b8-23 refers to animals, and An. 41 I a7-I does not exclude the existence of demons, who would rather consist of 7rvci3i? or ether than of fire or air. 68 Cf. e.g. I. During, Arctos I (I9S4), p. 76: "In Aristotle's writings, we can always expect to meet side by side the two dominant trends: Platonic abstraction and biological empiricism." b W. K. C. Guthrie, C]. Quart. 2 8 (I 934) ,p.98, rightly suggests "that Aristotle's system, instead of showing a development altogether away from Platonism, might rather be described as in some respects the furnishing of logical grounds for preserving what he regarded as the essential parts of Platonism intact," and points out how the theory of the 69</page><page sequence="15">unmoved mover and that of the plurality of unmoved movers may be explained as developments of different aspects of Plato's cosmology: 'The attainment of the one unmoved mover as the culmination of his theories of motion had restored to Aristotle one fundamental dogma of Platonism, that the first principle must at least be incorporeal. But in the Laws, his last work, Plato supposed for his theory not only a soul for the first heaven, but also a separate one for each of the planets, the sun and the moon... in Aristotle not only the first heaven but also the planets are to have external movers... Does it not look as if the discussions with Callippus the astronomer had had an ulterior purpose in view, that Aristotle had seen in astronomy the possibility of restoring another little bit of Platonic belief to the realm of true, because demonstrable, phi- losophy?" Cf. 1. During, Eran. j4 (1956), p. I 12: "Aristotle was struggling to become a Platonist and to reconcile his empirical and common sense approach to nature with Plato's idealism." 60 Cf. e.g. Meno 8 I cg '6i cpaecos &amp;7rac', auyyevois o5S".
