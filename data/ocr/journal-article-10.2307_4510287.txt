<plain_text><page sequence="1">VolXXII Recent Literature [181 Banding Activities on the Arctic Slope of Alaska.-Bird-banding activity at the Arctic Research Laboratory, Alaska, in the summer of 1951, has resulted, up to August 15th, in the banding of 632 birds. Population studies of the Snow Bunting, Plectrophenax nivalis (Linnaeus), and Lapland Longsplir, Calcarius lapponicus (Linnaeus), were initiated, and the numbers banded were 310 bunt- ings and 220 longspurs. About 25 per cent of these were also color-banded. As plans are under way to continue these studies in 1952, we would like to obtain some winter-range returns for both species and hope that banders and observers in southern Canada and the northern United States will be on the lookout for banded individuals. Other species banded are as follows: Baird Sandpiper, Pisobia bairdi (Coues) 35 Red-backed Sandpiper, Pelidna alpina sakhalina (Viellot) 23 Arctic Tern, Sterna paradisaea Brunnich 21 Red Phalarope, Phalaropus fulicarius (Linnaeus) 8 Semipalmated Sandpiper, Ereunetes pusillus (Linnaeus) 8 Golden Plover, Pluvialis dominica (Muller) 5 Ruddy Turnstone, Arenaria interpres morinella (Linnaeus) 1 Old-squaw, Clangula hyemalis (Linnaeus) 1 These studies are being conducted under a contract between the Office of Naval Research and the University of California.

Bird Ringing at Night. W. J. Eggeling. 1951. The Bokmakierie, 3(2): 29. South Africa's most active bander expla.ns his technique of capturing shore- birds at night. The requirements include a completely moonless night, the mask- ing noise of waves on the beach, and soft-soled shoes. Dr, Eggelingf shines a five- cell flashlight on the resting bird, approaches it stealthily, and drops over it a 13-inch diameter trout landing net having "a piece of light fish-netting stretched miiore or less tightly over the frame." In 1950 Dr. Eggeling captured several hun- dred birds in this manner, on one occasion 19 in a three-hour period.-H. H. Poor. 2. Banding Mourning Doves in Eastern Nebraska. Wilhelmina and LeRoy Gulotta. 1947. The Nebraska Bird Review, 15(2): 12-16. The dates of banding 508 nestling Mourning Doves, Zenaidura macroura (Linnaeus), in the vicinity of Lincoln, Nebraska, from 1940 to 1947, are presented. Over the eight seasons 14 were banded in May, 119 in June, 214 in July, 99 in August, and 62 in September, Nestling doves were banded in May during four of the eight years (1943-46), and in the other months from June to September in all eight years. Forty-nine of the 62 September bandings occurred from 1943 to 1945. An open hunting season on Mourning Doves in Nebraska during September of 1947 appears to have been responsible for the deaths of some September nestlings. Data indi- cate that some Mourning Doves have young in the nest into early October in south- eastern Nebraska.-L. R. Mewaldt. MIGRATION (See also Numbers 21, 23, 35, and 46.) 3. The Question of Inherited Migratory Routes. (Zur Frage der ange- borenen Zugwege.) Ernst Schuz. 1950. Die Vogelwarte, 15(4): 219-226. The auithor has considered recent experimental and field data in an admirable effort to rationalize the available information into some consistent pattern. It is pro- posed that migratory birds inherit the mechanisms for a definite migratory direction which in some cases is aston.shingly constant whereas in other species it is more variable. This fundamental direction may be varied in two general ways. There may be variations resulting from the general disposition to follow</page><page sequence="2">Bird-Banding 182] Recent Literature October an "ecologic compulsion" associated with food requirements, type of flight, etc. These variations from the fundamental direction are transitory. A second general type of deviation is that resulting from response to a series of landmarks or types of landscape. The particular response may be characteristic of only a certain population within a species. This second type of variation of direction, which may occur in series, is characteristic of all "narrow-front migrants" and certain of the "broad-front migrants." Bearing in mind the innate hazards of generaliza- tions involving more than a single species, the system herein proposed appears fundamentally logical.--D. S. Farner. 4. The Nature and Causes of the "Coastal Hiatus." George G, Williams. 1950. The Wilson Bulletin, 62(4): 175-182. During the spring migration there is an area along the northern shore of the Gulf of Mexico extending several hun- dred miles inland within which transient birds are highly intermittent in occur- rence, rare, or absent during many consecutive years. This recognized phenom- enon is commonly referred to as the "coastal hiatus." The author states in his summary (p. 182) that the "'coastal hiatus' of our Gulf States appears to be a lacuna south of and between two great spring migration triangles, one extending north and northeast from southern Texas, the other extending northwest, north, and northeast from Florida. In this lacuna few transient species occur during fair, warm weather. Periodic cold fronts, with northerly winds, striking the north- ern sides of these migration triangles, push migrants down against the coast, where they are often seen in great numbers immediately after the passage of a cold front. Sometimes the cold fronts push birds out over the Gulf itself, where they have been mistaken for trans-Gulf migrants." Although this hypothesis sounds reasonable and may correctly explain, at least in part, the "coastal hiatus," the author has failed to adequately demonstrate that cold fronts with northerly winds actually force migrants down against the coast from the north or northwest. Procedures used in making telescopic observations of night migrants are not men- tioned, nor are the results from these observations adequately presented. The other data are suggestive, but subject to more than one interpretation. It is ap- parent that a fresh approach to the entire subject of migration in the region of the Gulf of Mexico, including the "coastal hiatus," would be desirable.-L. R. Mewaldt. 5. Barometric Pressure-Patterns and Spring Bird Migration. A. M. Bagg, W. W. H. Gunn, D. S. Miller, J. T. Nichols, Winnifred Smith, and F. P. Wolfarth. 1950. The Wilson Bulletin, 62(1): 5-19. This paper presents a study of barometric pressure-pattern factors as they may be correlated with spring migra- tion in North America east of 100°W and south of 50°N. Several hypotheses are presented which state in part that northward movement of migrants in late winter and spring normally begins under conditions of a barometric gradient falling from east to west, and that a pronounced movement will take place into or through a given region during the interval between the passage of a warm front through that region and the subsequent arrival of a cold front. With the arrival of a cold front, usually accompanied by cloudiness and rain, an onrushing wave of migrants is arrested. The period of 17 to 22 April 1948 was selected as typical and briefly analyzed meteorologically and ornithologically. This description of those meteorological factors which apparently have an important modifying effect upon the more basic migratory patterns of many avian species, makes apparent the necessity for widespread coordination of effort to successfully study these phenomena. It is unfortunate that even in their review of "European References," the authors overlooked, or considered outside the "immediate scope" of their paper, several important European papers including contributions by H. Ahlquist, Giran Bergman, W. Hagen, O. Leivo, and Pontus Palmgren (1939). The methods em- ployed, and the conclusions reached by these and other European workers might have proved useful to the authors of this paper.-L. R. Mewaldt. 6. Oriented Migratory Activity of Caged Song Birds. (Orientierte Zugaktivitit gekiifigter Singvogel.) Gustav Kramer. 1950. Die Naturwissen- schaften, 37(8): 188. In the fall of 1949 recordings were made of the orientation of migrating passerine birds placed in cages. A Blackcap, Sylvia atricapilla (Lin- naeus), showed a distinct orientation between ESE and WSW when placed in a</page><page sequence="3">Vol. XXII Recent Literature [183 cage in a quiet field, At a location from which the reflection of the lights of the city could be seen orientation was toward the city (NE) but only when the observation place was established after the fall of darkness. If established during twilight or earlier, orientation was toward the S or SE. Similar results were ob- tained with three White Throats, Sylvia communis Latham.-D. S. Farner. 7. Further Analysis of the Factors which Orient the Migratory Activity of Caged Birds. (Weitere Analyse der Faktoren, welche die Zugaktivitat des gekafigten Vogels orientieren.) Gustav Kramer. 1950. Die Naturwissenschaften, 37(16): 377-378. Experiments in a radially symmetrical cage which allowed the experimental Starlings, Sturnus vulgaris Linnaeus, to see only limited sections of the sky, demonstrate clearly that orientation is not dependent on landmarks but rather, in some manner, on sunlight. This is confirmed by experiments with mirrors. Orientation becomes less definite, or disappears entirely, with cloudiness. -D. S. Farner. 8. William Dreuth's Study of Bird Migration in Lincoln Park, Chicago. Charles TJ Clark and Margaret M. Nice. 1950. The Chicago Academy of Sciences Special Publication No. 8. 43 pp. The authors have compiled the data from Dreuth's notebooks for the years 1926-1943 into useful tables which constitute a remarkably important set of data on migratioin. The list contains 256 species. For each is given the earliest date of arrival, average date of arrival, average date last seen, last date seen, number of days seen, and number of years seen; data are given for spring and fall migration.-D.

(Ankunft der Zugvogel und Sangesbeginn in Nord-und Westdeutschland 1948 und im Vergleich zu friiheren Jahren.) H. Bruns. 1949. Orn'thologische Abhand- lungen, 2:1-20. This is a useful and interesting compilation, mostly tabular, of more than 1600 arrival dates for 35 species. There are comparisons both with respect to species and locality. The data show a considerable influence of meteor- ologic conditions on arrival dates, Particularly influential are periods of low temperature which have a retarding effect.-D. S. Farner. 10. The Snowy Owl Migration of 1946-47. L. L. Snyder. 1949. The Wilson Bulletin, 61(2): 99-102. This is the third report of the Snowy Owl Com- mittee which collects and evaluates data pertaining to southward migrations of the Snowy Owl, Nyctea scandiaca (Linnaeus), into southern Canada and the United States. In eastern North America the 1946-47 flight was a "mere echo" of the very heavy 1945-46 flight. In western North America the 1946-47 flight was again fully as heavy as it had been the previous winter. The committee report suggests that, in general, influxes into extreme eastern North America have their origin in the eastern Arctic (east and northeast of Hudson Bay). Influxes of Snowy Owls into the mid-continent area and western North America originate primarily in the western Arctic (west and northwest of Hudson Bay). L. R. Mewaldt. 11. Mortality of Birds at the Ceilometer of the Nashville Airport. Walter R. Spofford. 1949. The Wilson Bulletin, 61(2): 86-90. During the pre- dawn hours of 10 September 1948, approximately 300 migrating birds were killed or injured at the ceilometer of the Nashville Airport at Nashville, Tennessee. The ceilometer sends a vertical beam of blueish light from a mercury-vapor lamp of great intensity into the sky and is effective in recording cloud levels up to 15,000 feet, During the predawn hours of 10 September, the ceiling varied from 5,000 feet to 9,700 feet. Weather conditions were seemingly favorable for migra- tion. Apparently those birds intercepting the beam of light became in some manner incapacitated, fell to the ground, and were killed or seriously injured upon impact with the ground. Birds were seen to fall down the shaft of light, and most fell within 50 to 100 feet of the ceilometer. A total of 248 birds of 34 species were recorded including six Pied-billed Grebes, Podilymbus podiceps Linnaeus; one American Bittern, Botaurus lentiginosus (Montagu); two Sora Rails, Porzana carolina (Linnaeus); and 31 species of passerine birds. The</page><page sequence="4">Bird-Banding 184] Recent Literature October author points out that the Nashville Airport ceilometer had been in use for years without a similar incident, and that such instruments are in common use on other airports. The actual combination of factors responsible for the incident remains obscure.-L. R. Mewaldt. 12. Homing Ability of Italian and German Homing Pigeons. (Heim- kehrleistungen italienischer und deutscher Reisetauben.) Lore Dinnendahl and Guistav Kramer. 1950. Die Vogelwarte, 15(4): 237-242. The rate of homing of German homing pigeons appears to be an inverse linear function of the distance of the flight. The performances of the Italian birds seem to indicate that there is an optimuim distance (200-400 kilometers) at which the greatest rate of hom- ing occurs. This is explained by the more favorable atmospheric conditions of the Mediterranean stummers.-D. S. Farner. FOOD AND FOOD HABITS (See also Numbers 34 and 35.) 13. Production and Utilization of Waterfowl Food Plants on the East Texas Gulf Coast. J. R. Singleton. 1951. Journal of Wildlife Management, 15(1): 46-56. The community productivity approach in this paper is fundamental to wildlife management. Fifty-five meter plots were established to obtain produc- tion from 14 important food plants. For beak rtush and wild millet it was shown that competition from plants of other species reduced production of seed. Burn- ing of leafy three-square and smartweed apparently had little effect upon seed production or vegetative yield. The air-dry yield of seed was 3,693 pounds per acre for all plants. Stems and leaves yielded 9,968 pounds (air dry) per acre. Corms of leafy three-square produced 9,580 pounds (air dry) per acre. An analysis of 410 duck stomachs collected in marshes along the Gulf Coast showed that of the plants studied spikerush, widgeon grass, smartweed, and pondweed were of great importance. Bulrush and sawgrass were of secondary importance. Rice formed the greatest portion of the diet (40 percent) and occurred 159 times in 410 stomachs. Despite sufficient available knowledge, the coastal marshes are improperly managed. Such practices as controlled burning, regulated livestock grazing, and regulated muiskrat trapping to prevent "eat-outs," are not widely applied, Expanded agricuiltuiral developments, drainage, industrialization, and oil exploration are eliminating some of the most important winter range for waterfowl on the continent.-Helmut K. Buechner. PHYSIOLOGY (See also Numbers 6, 7, and 33.) 14. Wisconsin Pheasant Reproduction Studies Based on Ovulated Fol- licle Technique. Irven 0. Buss, Roland K. Meyer and Cyril Kabat. 1951. Journal of Wildlife Management, 15(1): 32-46. This is the third and last article in a series of three by the same authors dealing with an ovulated-follicle technique used to determine reproductive performance of Ring-necked Pheasant. The first two are primarily concerned with development of the technique; the last provides additional data on pen studies that reveal egg-laying behavior, and reports an application to wild populations. Studies on reproduction in game-farm hens showed that: (1) Most hens started to lay by mid-April; (2) first-laying dates varied up to 30 days; (3) the average laying rate for 1,790 eggs was 1.3 days per egg; (4) an average of 34 eggs per hen was laid by 11 hens; (5) of these eggs, 12.5 were laid at random, 11.5 (Table 2 erroneously indicates 5.8) were laid in nests but not incubated, and 10 eggs were incubated in nests; (6) only 36 percent of the clutches were incubated; and (7) the initiation of egg laying is not directly related to the phenomena causing incubation. A resume of 5,611 nests studied in various parts of the United States showed that only 34 percent were successful, indicating that laying eggs at random and deserting one or two nests may represent typical behavior whether the birds are in natural habitat or in pens. Studies of wild pheasants on two areas near Madison, Wisconsin, showed: (1) The rate of involution (resorption) of ovulated follicles is almost identical with</page><page sequence="5">Vol. XXII Recent Literature [185 1951 rates measured in game-farm birds, (2) wild and propagated pheasants respond alike to the phenomena initiating egg laying, (3) first-egg dates are similar to those of penned birds, (4) wild pheasants may lay up to 50 eggs, and (5) repro- ductive performance may vary with range conditions. In comparing the Univer- sity Arboretum area (advanced succession) with the University Bay area (early succession) it was found that on the latter pheasants began laying earlier (April 20 compared with April 25), they laid fewer eggs (16 compared with 31), the average hatching date was earlier, the average brood size was larger, the number of broodless hens was fewer, and the number of young per adult was greater. Despite lower egg production, the population on the Bay area was more produc- tive. High egg production seems to be correlated with relatively low reproduc- tion.-Helmut K. Buechner. 15. The Effect of Age on Laying Dates, Size of Eggs, and Size of Clutch in the Yellow-eyed Penguin. L. E. Richdale. 1949. The Wilson Bulletin, 61(2): 91-98. From August 1936 to May 1948, the author carried out an intensive and significant study of the Yellow-eyed Penguin, Megadyptes antipodes (Hombron and Jaquinot), on the Otago Peninsula of New Zealand. The birds were banded to permit identification of individuals. This paper contains an analysis of data pertaining to egg-laying dates, egg size, and clutch size as they may be related to the age of the female. The age of the female apparently has no effect on the date of laying. Older females produce heavier and wider eggs than younger females. Among younger penguins, age, rather than laying history, seems the more important factor in the determination of egg size. Egg lengths show con- siderable variation in all age groups, The normal clutch size is two eggs. Fortv two-year-old females averaged 1.68 eggs per clutch, whereas 39 four-year-old females averaged 2.00 eggs per clutch. It is significant to note that of 31 three- year-olds which did not lay as two-year-olds, only one did not produce the normal complement of two eggs to the clutch. Sixty-three females seven to fourteen years old averaged 1.95 eggs per clujtch, which does not indicate a significant (Irop in egg producing capacity for this age group.-L. R. Mewaldt. 16. A Review of Experimental Investigations on Seasonal Reproduction in Birds. J. Wendell Burger. 1949. The Wilson Bulletin, 61(4): 211-230. This paper serves to emphasize the need for carefully planned investigations per- taining to the seasonal reproduction of birds. The author points out in speaking of reproductive cycles (p. 227) that all "truly wild species of birds tested have been influenced to some degree by photoperiodic manipulations," and that "photo- periodic changes are the only widely spread factor capable of modifying repro- ductive rhythmicity which is moderately wvell-known through experimental test- ing." Most experimental work has been done upon birds native to the northern hemisphere and which are either non-migratory, or do not migrate to the equa- torial regions or beyond, That psychic factors and other environmental factors in addition to light are important in bringing about reproduction in birds is indi- cated, but evaluation of these factors has been more difficult. lt is probable that genetic variability plays an important role in the differing responses of popula- tions even within a given species. The importance of the refractory period, dur- ing which a bird does not respond reproductively to increased photoperiod is discussed.-L. R. Mewaldt. 17. A Study of Absorption and Retention of Lead in Wild Waterfowl in Relation to Clinical Evidence of Lead Poisoning. Don R. Coburn, David W. Metzler, and Ray Treichler. 1951. Journal of Wildlife Management, 15(2): 186-192. Fourteen adult mallard ducks, which had been captured in the wild, were subjected to dosage levels of 3, 6, 8, and 12 milligrams of lead (aqueous solution of lead nitrate) per kilogram of body weight. Daily ingestion of 6 mg/kg. produced no toxic symptoms in two birds over a period of 137 days. When the dose was increased to 12 mg./kg., death resulted in 14 days for one bird and 22 days for the other. The critical intake level appeared to be between 6 and 8 mg./kg. Six ducks receiving the latter amount died following an average sur- vival period of about 28 days. The average amount of lead ingested was 158 mg., or approximately the weight of one No. 5 shot. Birds receiving 12 mg./kg. sur- vived an average of 3.5 days less than those receiving 8 mg./kg., but there was</page><page sequence="6">Bird-Banding 186] Recent Literature October no significant difference in the deposition of lead in the tissues of the two groups. Anemia and emaciation; atrophy of the liver, in part caused by necrosis; atrophy of the gizzard muscles and heart; and an above-normal production of bright- green bile were characteristic symptoms of the lead poisoning. Body weight, erythrocyte count, and hemoglobin content dropped sharply when poisoning be- came acute. Anisocytosis and poikilocytosis appeared soon after the birds were poisoned, and showers of poikilocytes occurred regularly as the rate of mature- red-cell destruction increased, The most significant increases in lead content were noted in the livers, the average value for poisoned birds being, 40 times that for the normal controls. In pathological birds the lead content of the skeletons was seven times higher than in the controls. Chemical analysis of liver or skele- ton is suggested as a diagnostic tool for the determination of plumbism in the wild.-Helmuit K. Buechner.

A reference chart is presented for datingf the events associated with nesting in Ruffed Grouse Bonasa umbellus (Linnaeus). Using this chart, hatchingf dates were computed for 69 broods from each of which one specimen was collected during the summer of 1949. Forty-two (61 percent) hatched durinn0 the two-week period, May 27-June 9. The sharp peak of hatching and the short nesting season indicated high success of first nests and little renesting.-Helmut K. Buechner. 19. Notes on the Artificial Propagation of Wood Duck. Harold C. Hanson. 1951. Journal of Wildlife Management, 15(1): 68-72. To test the homing instincts of pen-reared Wood Ducks, Aix sponsa (Linnaeus), at,empts were made by the Illinois Natural History Survey to propagate the bird artifi- cially. Of 467 eggs brought to the hatchery in 1944, 297 (64 percent) hatched successfully. Out of 297 ducklings taken from the incubator, 242 (81 percent) were successfully reared to 5-6 weeks. At this age they were transported to points in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Illinois for an additional 1-3 weeks of captivitv prior to release in the wild. Ducklings were reared on turkey starter mash in small pellet form. Light bulbs were used to attract insects, and it is believed that the large number of insects eaten contributed greatly to the physical condition and health of the birds. The principal known cause of fatalities in 1944 and in two previous rearing experiments was the paratyphoid bacter-ium, Salmonella. Ap- parently the disease is transmitted in the wild through infected eggs. Success in artificial propagation of the Wood Duck depends primarily on control of para- typhoid disease. The results of the release of pen-reared Wood Ducks made in Wisconsin by the Natural History Survey were reported in 1947 by Robert A. McCabe in the Wilson Bulletin, 59(2): 104-109.-Helmut K.

Several thousand hours were involved in this intensive study of the Cedar Waxwing, Bombycilla cedrorum Vieillot, during six summers between 1939 and 1946 on South Bass Island in Lake Erie north of Sandusky, Ohio. Birds were color banded to facilitate identification of individuals. Only two of 54 banded adults returned a following year and none of 174 banded as nestlings were again recovered. From eight to fifteen pairs nested simultane- ously during any one year in the study area, The subjects treated include forma- tion of pairs, territory, courtship, voice, nest and eggs, the role of the sexes during incubation, attentiveness during incubation, incubation period, care of young, development of young, renesting, social behavior, and nesting success. Incuba- tion was performed entirely by the female who was fed on the nest by the male. During 402 hours of daylight observation during incubation, 236 periods of atten- tion by the female averaged 44.8 minutes. Frequently, daylight periods of atten- tiveness longer than 120 minutes were observed. Of some interest is the observa- tion that males start bringing insects instead of fruit to the nest at hatching and for about the next three days, after which time fruit is again the principal food carried to the nest.

A colony of Agelaius phoe- niceus (Linnaeus) in a 2.4-acre marsh on Lake Wingra, Madison, Wisconsin, was studied by means of banded individuals. Spring migration began with the arrival of vagrants which were followed by resident adult males, resident first-year males, resident adult females, migrant first-year males, and finally migrant females. Red-winged Blackbirds are highly territorial; evidence is presented that first-year males may locate although not defend territories. Once established there is a pronounced tendency for males to return to the same territory year after year. At least six basic display patterns are recognizable. Of 118 nests observed started, 101 were completed; 321 eggs were laid in 91 nests; 258 eggs hatched in 78 nests and 170 young were fledged from 57 nests.-D. S. Farner.

A study based on field observa- tions in Northern Rhodesia providing detailed specific compositioins of 276 bird parties. After discussing the instances where two or more different species of the same family were found in the same party, the author uses statistical methods to measure the degree of association between species, and concludes that the figures "lend little support to the hypothesis that closely related species cannot exist together in the same environment unless their feeding habits differ."- Hustace H. Poor. 23. Role of the Family in the Formation of Goose Flocks. William H. Elder and Nina L. Elder. 1949. The Wilson Bulletin, 61(3): 132-140. An analysis of counts upon 4,598 small flocks (20 or fewer birds) of Canada Geese, Branta canadensis (Linnaeus), while in migration in the United States is pre- sented. These data indicate that in the fall of the year, before the hunting sea- son, the most common flock size is six. Additional increases in the frequency of flock sizes occurred at ten and fifteen birds. Available evidence indicates that Canada Geese tend to remain in family groups for nearly a year, with two or more family groups frequently banding together at least part of the time. A compari- son o0 small flock sizes before and after a hunting season revealed that post-season flocks tended to be smaller than pre-season flocks. The authors suggest that a count of several hundred small flocks arriving at a refuge in the fall might provide a good index of the success of that year's hatch.-L, R. Mewaldt. 24. Territory and Song in the Least Flycatcher. Peggy Muirhead Mac- Queen. 1950. The Wilson Bulletin, 62(4): 194-205. Territory and song of the Least Flycatcher, Empidonax minimus (Baird and Baird), were studied during the summers of 1942, 1944, and 1946 in the vicinity of Douglas Lake, Cheboygan County, Michigan. Three nesting females were banded to facilitate identification of individuals. The territories of 44 pairs studied were of two types: one in which a pair mated, nested, and fed throughout the "reproductive cycle"; and the other in which the pair mated and nested, but fed in a neutral feedingf area nearby. Thirty-three measured territories varied in size from 0.03 acres to 0.5 acres (aver- age 0.18 acres). Territories were defended principally by the males, with females participating less frequently. At least from e-g-laying to scattering of the young, the males devoted a definite part of each morning to their morning song which began before dawn and ended about sunrise.-L. R. Mewaldt. 25. Cowbird Behavior. Amelia R. Laskey. 1950. The Wilson Bulletin, 62 (4)-: 157-174. The mating habits and territorial behavior of the Cowbird, Molothrus ater (Boddaert), were studied during the breeding seasons of 1944, 1945, and 1946 at Nashville, Tennessee. Most of the observations were of 29 color-banded individuals (18 males and 11 females) which were attracted to a feeding area at the author's home. The author's observations indicate that the</page><page sequence="8">188] Recent Literaiture October Cowbird is monogamouis rather than polygamous or promiscuous. During 1944 one male proved to be dominant over all other nmales and one female was likewise dominant over all other females on the feeding area and in the immediate vicinity. These two birds showed behavior indicating they were a pair including the fact that they were observed to copulate three times in the vicinity of the feeding area. No other birds exhibited such behavior on the study area. No evidence of true territorial behavior was found. The author suggests that this area, designated as the domain, may be all that is left of "territory," with intimidation bows and guarding of mates all that is left of mate protection and isolation in this social species whose breeding has become parasitic.-L.

During the summers of 1944, 1946, and 1947 approximately 600 hours were spent observing the breeding behavior of the Ameri- can Goldfinch, Spinus tristis (Linnaeus), on 24 acres of park and marsh-land in Madison, Wisconsin, Of 230 nests, 68 percent were placed in elderberry, Sam- buscus canadensis Linnaeus, the most abundant shrub. The study placed empha- sis upon pair formation, establishment of territory, and breeding success. Pair formation took place in May or earlier while the birds were still in flocks even though nesting (lid not occur until July. Territories in the most densely populated part of the study area averaged about 95 feet in diameter and did not necessarily include food, water, or nest material. Both sexes defended the nest territory against other goldfinches, especially during the early part of the nesting cycle. During the three years, 239 nests containing 696 eggs resuilted in a fledging suc- cess of 49 percent. Approximately 15 percent started a second brood between 5 August and 1 September. The males first began to show post-nuiptial molt dturing the first week in September.-L. R. Mewaldt.

(Die Vogelwelt des feuchten Eichen-Hainbuchen-Waldes.) Otto Niebuhr. 1948. Ornithologische Abhandlungen, 1. 28 pp. The author has studied the breeding- bird popuilations, primarily by means of censuses of singing males, in seven plots (2.CO-8.35 hectares) in Hanover. The habitats are classified as follows: A,, 200- year-old oak forest with underbrush near village; A2, 200-year-old oak forest with underbrush; B1, oak forest with trunks 50-65 centimeters in diameter and under- brush 2-4 meters high; B2, same with underbrush up to 2 meters; B3, same with underbrtish having been removed the previous winter; Cl, oak forest with trunks 30-40 centimeters in diameter (60-70 years) with underbrush 1.5-2.0 meters high; C2, same without underbrush; Di, young pole wood (planted), oak or oak-alder with largest trunks 20 centimeters in diameter, trees 6-7 meters high; E, natural replacement or nursery. Thirty-eight breeding species were involved. The num- bers of species according to habitat were as follows: A1 13.64; A2 7.24; B1 3.08; B3 2.77; C 2.45; D 1.48; E 4.10. Densities per hectare were: A, 23.86; A2 11.38; B1 9.26; B2 5.90; B3 3.60; C 3.15; D 1.95; E 7.80. In general the utilization of forests by man prevents maximal densities of birds. "The avifauna attains its optimal density in forests of the most natural type. In a primitive mesophytic oak-hornbeam forest it may attain a density of 900-1,000 pairs per square kilo- meter."

Journal of Wildlife Management, 15(1): 20-27. To determine the effects of DDT spraying on bird life at Princeton, New Jersey, a sprayed study area within the city was compared with an unsprayed check area in the rural outskirts of the town. Following spraying 26 birds were found dead or dying, indicating a negligible effect on the total population. On a 20-acre census plot approximately one bird per two acres was found dead, including six nestlings, four immature birds, and one adult. Information from residents inter- ested in birds indicated a decline in population over the three-year period, 1947-</page><page sequence="9">Vol XXII Recent Literature 1189 1949, but the decrease probably resulted from reductions in numbers of insects and were independent of direct mortality caused by DDT spraying. Among the birds common to both plots, an increase of 6 percent occurred on the unsprayed area and a decrease of 22 percent occurred on the sprayed area immediately fol- lowing spraying. Those that decreased on the study area were Song Sparrow, Catbird, House Wren, Cardinal, and Crested Flycatcher. Canopy feeders such as orioles, warblers, chickadees, nuthatches, pewees, and vireos, were notably absent on the treated plot. Previous spraying may have eliminated or discouraged these species from using the area. Throughout the post-spraying period the numbers of Robins and Wood Thrushes on the study area remained high and none of these birds were found dead. They outnumbered all other species, except grackles, and fed constantly under sprayed elms. In the period during or immediately following spraying six nests containing 18 young were under observation. Only eight (44 percent) were brought to a successful fledging. Of nine nests and 21 young observed in the check area, 15 (71 percent) fledged. It is recommended that spraying be completed by April 15 to prevent direct mortality.-Helmut K. Buechner. 29. Effects of Five-Year DDT Application on Breeding Bird Popula- tion. Chandler S. Robbins, Paul F. Springer, and Clark G. Webster. 1951. Journal of Wildlife Management, 15(2): 213-216. A 117-acre tract of bottomland forest on the Patuxent Research Refuge at Laurel, Maryland, received aerial appli- cations of DDT in oil at the rate of two pounds per acre each spring from 1945 through 1949. Birds were counted on a 31-acre plot at the center of the treated area and on a 32-acre, unsprayed check area. The three commonest breeding species, Red-eyed Vireo, Vireo olivaceus (Linnaeus) ; Parula Warbler, Parula americana (Linnaeus); and American Redstart, Setophaga ruticilla (Linnaeus), showed decreases of 44, 4.0, and 28 percent, respectively, over the four-year period. All three are insectivorous, tree-top feeders. Of the total decrease, 72 percent was attributed to these three birds; no significant decrease was observed for other species. The treated area showed a decline of 26 percent over the entire period, compared to an increase of 1.6 percent in the control area.-Helmut K. Buechner.

Censuses made in June and July, 1948, along Teslin River, near Johnson's Crossing, Yukon Territory, indicated in terms of numbers of bird indi- viduals per hundred acres, a variation between 1.3 and 13.0, average 5.2 for lodge- pole pine habitat (9 samples); and between 3.4 and 9.3, average 5.6, for spruce habitat (3 samples).-W.

Journal of Wildlife Manage- ment, 15(1): 13-19, Presented in this paper are the Clopper and Pearson graphs showing confidence limits at the 95 percent and 99 percent levels for the relation- ship between total population and sample ratio (marked to unmarked animals). These graphs should be extremely useful for rapid determination of the range within which a population determined by the Lincoln index may lie. It is shown that confidence limits obtained by the graphic method compared closely with those obtained by mathematical computations, but that for small samples and samples that approach ratios of 0.0 and 1.0 (extremes) the graphs are more accurate. For large samples the graphs provide limits that are too broad. Since the graphs are difficult to read for small ratios (less than 0.05), graphs of the confidence limits for the Poisson distribution are provided for more accurate reading. It is sug- gested that the graphs may be used for sex ratios, age ratios, size ratios, hunter and fisherman success ratios, and many other types of ratio data. The paper pro. vides a working tool for the determination of limits for population indexes.- Helmut K.

A Classification of Recent Birds. Ernst Mayr and Dean Amadon. 1951. American Museum Novitates, 1496. 42 pp. Using as a basis the weI- estab'ished sequence of Wetmore, which is used also in the Peters Check-list, the authors have incorporated such changes which, in their opinion, are clearly indi- cated by recent evidence. The older ordinal names of Stresemann are used. The bulk of the paper consists of discussions, by systematic groups, of problems on which recent evidence has shed additional light. This is followed by the revised "Systematic List" (pp. 32-38), annotated with numbers referringf to the discus- sions of the preceding pages. Among the interesting changes are the elevation of the flamingoes to ordinal status, the placement of the Cuculi (Cuculiformes) near the galliform birds primarily because of the similarity of the turacos and galli- form birds, reduction of several shore-bird families to subfamilies, and rather extensive revision of the families of passerine birds and their sequence including the placement of the crows and "Australian crow-like" families at the end of the list. Numerous interesting comments are made on controversial relationships which are not changed in the list. It should be emphasized that this is a paper which can be studied with great profit and interest by many ornithologists other than those primarily interested in taxonomy and systematics. The previous num- ber of species oompiled by Mayr is revised downward from 8616 to 8590.- D. S. Farner. EVOLUTION (See Numbers 32, 34, and 40.) BOOKS AND MONOGRAPHS 33. Sexual Behavior in Penguins. L. E. Richdale. 1951. Universitv or Kansas Press. Lawrence. Kansas. xiii + 316 pp.. 22 photographs, $5. This book summarizes, in part, one of the most remarkable series of investigations in the history of ornithology. For more than ten years Mr. Richdale has studied closely a colony of Yellow-eyed Penguins, Megadvptes antipodes (Hombron and Jacquinot). on the Otago Peninsula, New Zealand. By means of foot-marking and banding it has been possible for him to know individually a very substantial portion of the individuals in the colony. His voluminous and painstakingly de- tailed notes have allowed the development of an understanding of the behavior of these birds to a degree scarcely realized for any other species. This treatise is confined to those aspects of behavior observed ashore which involve birds of the same or opposite sexes and which may be "aggressive" or of a "love-habit n,ature." To attempt to summarize in any way the enormous quantity of informa- tion in this attractive book is patently impossible. Few books in the field of orni- thology contain as much new information and as many new ideas. The author has refreshingly avoided anthropomorphic interpretations and conclusions although the terms employed, e. g. "divorce," "unemployed," etc., may have connotations in this respect unless the reader makes careful note that the author's definitions carefully divorce any connotations of anthropomorphism. There are chapters dealing successively with the scope of the study, an analysis of types of behavior, pair formation, sex differences, sexual behavior in winter, pre-egg stage, unem- ployed birds, incubation, chick stage, and molt. Several appendices give some of the detailed data. There are indices to subjects, authors, and bands, The photo- graphs are excellent and form an integral part of the presentation. The text is replete with comparisons with other species; particularly important are the com- parisons with other oceanic birds such as petrels, prions, and albatrosses which the author knows well from his other investigations. Perhaps the only shortcom- ing might be the failure to draw extensive comparative information from con- tinental Europe; this is to be explained primarily by the inaccessability of certain journals to the author.</page></plain_text>
