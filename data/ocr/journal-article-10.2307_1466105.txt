<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of the American Academy of Religion LXIV/2 AAR Scriptural Adaptation in the Adi Granth Pashaura Singh I IN HIS PERCEPTIVE work What Is Scripture? Wilfred Cantwell Smith raises an important issue of how one religious movement explicitly incor- porates the scripture of another as such within its own, "adding things new but making the old part and parcel--even though in ways to this day never fully clarified: a somewhat subordinate part and parcel, heavily re-interpreted" (54-55). Although the author claims that the Christian scripture provides the "only instance in world history," he cites the exam- ple of Sikh scripture, the Adi Granth, emulating the idea in a minor fash- ion. The Adi Granth (or Sri Guru Granth Sahib), Smith argues, includes primarily the hymns and sayings of the Sikh Gurus, but also a relatively small percentage of passages by the "Bhagats" (Panjabi; cf. Sanskrit bhakta) of a slightly earlier time or not formally members of what has subsequently coalesced into the Sikh community. The purpose of this paper is to examine the place of the hymns of non-Sikh Bhagats in the Sikh scriptural tradition.'

Karine Schomer, for instance, maintains that some selection of Kabir's sayings must have been made by the compilers of the Adi Granth on the basis of conformity to the "moods and motiva- tions" of the Sikh community (77). To a point it is true that the hymns of the Bhagats are included in the Adi Granth because of a basic agreement with the beliefs of the Gurus. It is also true that the fifth Guru, Arjan (1563-1606 CE), edited the Bhagat material before incorporating it in the scripture and seemingly chose only those aspects of the bhagat bani that were in basic agreement with Sikh teachings. But these assertions may not tell the whole story. They tend to underscore the traditional view of absolute identity between the teachings of the Bhagats and the Sikh Gurus. This is too simplistic a view of what may have been a complex phenomenon. There are, for instance, some verses of the Bhagats included in the Adi Granth which are juxtaposed with the comments made on them by the Gurus: Particularly, the verses of Kabir, Shaikh Farid, Sur Das, and Dhanna have received direct comments from the Gurus. These com- ments are not always made because of agreement between the Gurus and the Bhagats but are sometimes made to register clear disagreements with the views of the Bhagats. In both instances, that is, the instances of agree- ment and disagreement, the comments of the Gurus serve to define their own understanding of the developing Sikh community at that particular stage of its history. In an earlier study I have examined in more detail the concerns behind the Gurus' comments on the verses of the poet-saints. These comments serve to do three things. First, they highlight the Gurus' self-understanding of particular themes contained in the verses of the Bhagats and promote thereby a process of self-definition for the Sikh community. For instance, the Gurus provide the ideals of moderate living and disciplined worldliness for the Sikh community in their comments on the verses of Shaikh Farid which emphasize the ideals of self-torture and asceticism. Second, the Gurus' comments provide more clarity and understand- ing to the obscure texts of the Bhagats so that they become intelligible. The aim here is to render the whole of the bhagat bani coherent and its message meaningful to the Gurus' contemporary audience. Third, these comments voice emphatically the Gurus' differences from the vision of the Bhagats on certain important issues (Pashaura Singh 1987:13-15, 110-116). For instance, the Gurus differ from both Kabir and Shaikh Farid on the issue of the primacy of divine grace over personal effort in spiritual progress. The Sikh view of divine grace requires that one must have the belief that the whole of one's spiritual progress is a matter of</page><page sequence="3">Singh: Scriptural Adaptation in the Adi Granth 339 divine grace, not of one's efforts alone. Thus, in their comments on the verses of the poet-saints the Gurus emphasize that God's gifts are not ulti- mately dependent upon the merit of the individual. Ultimately divine grace is fundamental and is a mystery. In the light of these observations it may be stated that the selection of the bhagat bani was not made exclu- sively on the basis of identity with the teachings of the Gurus. There is difference as well as identity. Thus it is important to note that the Gurus were deeply concerned to cultivate a particular Sikh view of true teach- ing, practice, and community by way of editing and commenting on the received tradition of the bhagat bani. This paper deals more specifically with the doctrinal issues arising from the inclusion of the bhagat bani in the Sikh scriptural tradition. It is based on the actual examination of a number of manuscripts of the Adi Granth, including the original Kartarpur bir ("recension"), so-called because it resides at Kartarpur in Jalandhar District of the Punjab, in the possession of the Sodhi descendants of Dhir Mal. The Kartarpur manu- script was completed on August 1, 1604 CE (sambat 1661 miti bhadaun vadi ekam 1) under the direct supervision of Guru Arjan and recorded by his amanuensis, Bhai Gurdas. There are certain instances in this manu- script where certain hymns of the Bhagats are either obliterated with the use of hartal, a "yellow-greenish paste" used for deletion, or simply crossed out with a pen. These deletions clearly illustrate Guru Arjan's readiness to exercise editorial discretion. The examination of old manu- scripts indicates that the hartal was normally used by the scribes during the process of writing (when they were so directed to obliterate a particu- lar verse or hymn), whereas the "crossings" with a pen reflected a later decision of the editor to exclude a particular composition from the scrip- ture. The latter was sometimes accompanied by a marginal note. Before proceeding to examine the issue of deletions, however, we must deter- mine who was responsible for collecting the hymns of the Bhagats in the first place and making them part of the Sikh scriptural tradition. II It is commonly assumed that the founder of Sikh faith, Guru Nanak (1469-1539 CE), must have collected the Bhagat material during his extensive travels. Sahib Singh, for instance, discusses this issue at length and asserts that a comparative analysis of some of Guru Nanak's works and those of Kabir clearly indicates thematic as well as verbal similarities which can be explained by the assumption that Guru Nanak had access to at least some of Kabir's works (26-43). However, WH. McLeod chal- lenges this assumption by arguing that many of the resemblances that Sahib Singh perceives are too vague to warrant consideration as they con- cern common themes rather than actual correspondence (1966:89-90).</page><page sequence="4">340 Journal of the American Academy of Religion He then quotes five brief passages of less than two lines each which possess verbal correspondence and asserts that they may simply be pro- verbial expressions that may have come from the religious language of everyday life of North India. The following examples from the hymns of Beni, Kabir, and Guru Nanak will illustrate the point: 1. Says Beni: the Guru-directed thus meditates; Without the True Guru, one does not find the way (Beni, Prabhati 1, AG:1351) 2. Without the True Guru, one does not find the way. Explaining the mystery, so says Kabir. (Kabir, Basant 3, AG: 1194) 3. Says Nanak: with trusting faith one meditates; Without the True Guru, one does not find the way. (Ml, Sahasakriti 1, AG: 1353) The original Punjabi expression binu satgur bat na pavai ("without the True Guru, one does not find the way") is common to the hymns of Beni and Guru Nanak. Although. it differs slightly in the case of Kabir's hymn (binu satgur bat na pai), the sense is retained. McLeod maintains that such examples are a type of epigram which could easily have gained common currency within the circle of the Sants. He concludes that "in all likeli- hood Guru Nanak and Kabir neither met nor knew each other's works" (McLeod 1966:92; 1968:86, n. 2). There are two significant points that need to be made in the context of present discussion. In the first place, Guru Nanak does not mention Kabir or any other Bhagat in his own works. Secondly, he does not comment on any verse of Kabir or any other Sant poet, as he does in the case of Shaikh Farid (Pashaura Singh 1987:37-46). He was certainly familiar with the hymns of the Sufi poet, and nine of Guru Nanak's hymns are composed in the language characteristic of Farid-bani (Shackle 1989:26, n. 27). Shaikh Farid's mystical songs in old Punjabi were intended to be recited or sung as a part of religious music in the Sufi worship. They influenced the entire population of the Punjab, particularly women, who used to sing these simple verses while doing their daily work (Schimmel: 348). These Sufi songs certainly attracted the special attention of Guru Nanak for comment about what constitutes true religious belief and practice. There is, however, no documentary evidence to support the contention that Guru Nanak was primarily responsible for collecting the hymns of the Sufi poet and other Bhagats and for making them part and parcel of Sikh scriptural tradition. It was the third Guru, Amar Das (1479-1574 CE), who mentioned the names of Kabir and Namdev for the first time in his hymns. He also inserted a number of Kabir's shaloks in his own vars ("ballads") and responded to them in his commentary verses for the sake of defining true teaching, practice, and community from the viewpoint of Sikh doctrine</page><page sequence="5">Singh: Scriptural Adaptation in the Adi Granth 341 (Pashaura Singh 1987:84-91). Moreover, Guru Amar Das provides the reasons underlying the inclusion of the bhagat bani in the Sikh scriptural tradition in a particularly interesting verse: Nama (Namdev) the Chhimba and Kabir the Julaha obtained their spiritual status from the Perfect Guru. In divine knowledge, recognizing the Word (sabad), they spurned all self-centeredness (haumai) and caste. Even gods and men sing their bani and none can wipe it away, my brother. (3) (M3, Siri Ragu 22, AG: 67) Here Guru Amar Das acknowledges that Namdev and Kabir had the ex- perience of the divine Truth which they proclaimed in verbal form (sabad) in their compositions. Thus, their inclusion in the Sikh scriptural tradition follows naturally from the doctrine of the universal bani, which appears perpetually in all ages in the works of the Bhagats. What cannot be effaced deserved to be preserved and thus collected alongside the works of the Gurus. The presence of the bhagat bani in the two available Goindval volumes (pothis) provides the documentary evidence that Guru Amar Das was responsible for introducing the compositions of the medieval saints into the early Sikh scriptural tradition. It should, however, be emphasized that the hymns of the Bhagats were circulating in the Punjab through travel- ling professional singers who used them in kirtan ("devotional singing") sessions (Callewaert:29-35). That is why they were taken as a starting point during the selection process, subject to confirmation after Guru Amar Das had carefully gone through them. This process began with a sifting of the writings of those Bhagats who shared the Sikh theological vision, a vision that involved a belief in One God (Akal Purakh, "the Timeless Being") beyond all form and sectarian garb, the basic equality of human beings, the doctrine of Word, the spiritual discipline of nam- simaran ("meditation on the divine Name"), the doctrine of God as True Guru immanent in human soul, the company of the saintly people, the emphasis upon true inner religiosity, and so on. Those hymns that did not conform to these ideals were rejected in preliminary scrutiny. In the Goindval volumes the clusters of hymns by Kabir and Namdev are entitled bhairon kamiru nama bhagat babe de, "the hymns in bhairon mode by Kamiru and Nama, the devotees of Guru Baba [Nanak]" (Gurdit Singh:3-4, 555). Two explanations may be offered for this striking title concerning the status of the Sant poets in the Sikh tradition. First, Kabir and Namdev were generally scorned by the learned and high-born, and their compositions were ignored as being of no significance. Comment- ing on the low-bomrn Sants including Kabir and Namdev, for instance,</page><page sequence="6">342 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Vaudeville writes: "They are generally ignorant, if not always illiterate, workshop prophets and village saints whom the learned and high-born despise and ignore" (1974:99). This kind of attitude towards the Sants was the result of their vigorous attack on the smarta tradition, that is, the social and religious order taught in the Dharmashastras and the Pura- nas and based on the Vedas. Tulsi Das, for instance, referred to the Sant poetry in the Dohavali (Doha 554) as follows: "In this dark age with sa- khis, shabads and dohas, with tales and stories, these devotees expound devotion, while scorning the Veda and Puranas" (Allchin:49). He consid- ered all of the Sants as a serious threat to conventional Hindu tradition and accused them as follows: "They leave the path of devotion to Hari and dream many new paths" (Doha 555, Allchin: 49). In the wake of such criticism it may have been necessary for Guru Amar Das to own Kabir and Namdev as devotees of Guru Nanak so that he might establish them in the early Sikh scriptural tradition. Second, the title in the Goindval pothis may reflect an editorial device that simultaneously incorporates and supersedes the Sant tradition. To use Wilfred Cantwell Smith's phrase, it may also imply that the bhagat bani was held as "a somewhat subordinate part and parcel" of the early Sikh scriptural tradition. By treating Kabir and Namdev as "devotees of Guru Nanak," the third Guru was, in fact, extending an open invitation to their followers to join the Sikh Panth in the second half of the six- teenth century. He was certainly responsible for the institutional expan- sion that included the establishment of the city of Goindval, the biannual festivals of Divali and Baisakhi providing an opportunity for the growing community to gather and meet the Guru, and a missionary system (man- jis) for attracting new converts. It should, however, be emphasized here that the title in the Goindval pothis reflects the contemporary Sikh under- standing of the status of Kabir and Namdev as devotees of Guru Nanak. This understanding may also be seen in the panegyrics by bards in praise of Guru Nanak (Kal, Savayye 8, AG:1390). It was part of the ancient tri- umphant (digvijaya) tradition. Guru Arjan extended the precedent of Guru Amar Das when he com- piled the "final" text of the Adi Granth. He made further selection and dropped several hymns of Kabir and Namdev available in the Goindval volumes. In the case of the bani of Namdev, he seems to have done recast- ing of certain hymns to fit them in the context of the teachings of the Gurus and to simplify the language of others originally composed in the Marathi dialect (Nirbhai Singh: 190-191). He arranged the works of the Bhagats under the common title as follows: ragu asa bani bhagatan ki: Kabirjiu Namdeujiu Ravidasjiu, "the bani of the Bhagats [such as] Kabir, Namdev and Ravidas in Asa mode" (AG:475). This new title indicates that the Bhagats were duly acknowledged as part and parcel of the Sikh tradition when their compositions were included in the final text of the Adi Granth. It also suggests that they all shared a common status, be-</page><page sequence="7">Singh: Scriptural Adaptation in the Adi Granth 343 cause they were all judged to have spoken the divine Word confirmed as such by the Sikh Gurus. The most striking example in this context is Guru Arjan's Basant Astapadi in which he illuminates the spiritual attain- ment of all Sant poets (AG: 1192). It is quite possible that by his time the followers of the Bhagats had become an integral part of the Sikh Panth. Moreover, in contrast with Guru Nanak's comments on Shaikh Farid and Guru Amar Das's reflections on both Kabir and Farid, Guru Arjan's verses of commentary bear the "signatures" of the Bhagats who are being commented upon. This new convention shows a more intimate relation- ship with the bhagat bani. In these instances Guru Arjan is actually ad- dressing the followers of Kabir and Farid directly, as the case may be, while commenting on a particular composition of the Sant or Sufi poet (AG: 1375-76, 1381-84). Through these comments he is, in fact, address- ing the issues being debated between the Sikh community and the fol- lowers of the Bhagats. The most striking example of it is the use of Kabir's signatures in the Bhairau hymn, where Guru Arjan makes a direct asser- tion of independent Sikh identity; "We are neither Hindu nor Musalaman" (AG:1136). Although this hymn has a parallel in the Kabir-granthavali (pad 338), the last two verses, including the line quoted above, are not to be found there (Dvivedi:158). Guru Arjan seems to have adapted certain lines of Kabir in the first three verses, and for this reason he employed his "signatures" in his hymn. But the last two verses are definitely Guru Arjan's own composition. In fact, here the Guru had in his mind a par- ticular hymn of Kabir (Bhairau 7, AG:1158-9) on the same theme and in the same musical mode when he composed his own hymn. To understand the technique of textual commentary more fully, let us examine Kabir's theme of self-withdrawal from active life. His autobio- graphical hymns in the Adi Granth clearly state that "Kabir does not care for his profession," and "he has ruined the whole business" (Bilavalu 4, AG: 856). His wife complains that "our daughter and sons have nothing to eat," and "he no longer speaks of his beam and shuttle" (Gond 6, AG: 871). There is a sense in which passivity is raised to the level of norma- tive behavior for the mystic: Kabir, whatever I propose, God disposes; so why propose and scheme? For, what God proposes, He does; and does He what one cannot even dream? (Kabir, Salok 219, AG:1376) Rather than accepting the divine will with a positive attitude, Kabir here seems to want to escape from life, giving.up all proposing and scheming for the sake of living. This escapist attitude is directly opposed to the Sikh vision of action- oriented life in the world and a joyous acceptance of the divine will in</page><page sequence="8">344 Journal of the American Academy of Religion every situation whether favorable or not. For the Gurus, creative activity in the world is the yardstick of one's progress in the life of spirituality. Guru Amar Das responds to Kabir's view as follows: He himself puts care (chinta) in us, He himself makes us carefree (achintu): Nanak, give praise to that One who takes care of all. (M3, Salok 220, AG:1376) The word chinta in the present context means "care and anxiety" that one experiences in one's life while participating in worldly affairs. Guru Amar Das asserts that one should put one's faith exclusively in the indwelling God who looks after everyone in his/her mundane concerns. Thus by submitting to the divine will cheerfully one can become carefree (achintu) and gain confidence to cope with any situation of anguish and despair, because every happening is then seen to be coming from God. Here the Guru clearly provides a corrective to Kabir's view of self-withdrawal by stressing the need to confront life with a positive attitude. However, in order to guard against the excessive indulgence or over- confidence in the things of the world, Guru Arjan adds a further com- ment as follows: Kabir! man meditated not on Ram, he wandered, following his desires. Whilst given to sin, he died: in one moment, his life span was over. (M5, Salok 221, AG:1376) Here, Guru Arjan employs the signatures of "Kabir" and describes the nature of unregenerate man who is so attached to his passions for worldly pleasures that he forgets God and wastes his entire life in sin. The remark is clearly intended to create a harmonized "balance" between the extremes of withdrawal and excessive indulgence in the things of the world. Thus the Gurus' comments serve to highlight the distinctive Sikh way of life for the benefit of the Sikh community. Finally, it is important to note that a clear distinction is always main- tained between gurbani ("utterances of the Gurus") and the bhagat bani in the very structure of the Sikh scripture. The writings of the Bhagats are kept separate from those of the Gurus and are placed at the end of each raga section. In other words, the primacy of the writings of the Gurus is always maintained, even though the hymns of the Bhagats are held in great esteem. Nevertheless, the issue of the status of the bhagat bani has been surfacing in Sikh literature from time to time, revealing an ambiguity in the historical experience of the Sikh community. It will receive an ex-</page><page sequence="9">Singh: Scriptural Adaptation in the Adi Granth 345 tensive treatment in a separate article. Here, I will rather focus on the process that went into the selection of the writings of the Bhagats permit- ted into the Sikh scripture. III Now let us turn to the issue of deletions of certain hymns of the bhagat bani from the Sikh scripture. These hymns must have had considerable a priori status to get so far as being included in the final Kartarpur manu- script. Their subsequent deletion, however, raises the following important questions: why were these hymns included in the Sikh scripture in the first place, and why were they excluded later on? Could the later deletions reflect a tension between the followers of the Bhagats and the Sikhs at that particular time? In order to find answers to these questions, let us begin with the examination of the issues arising from the deletion of certain hymns of Kabir who is otherwise prominently represented in the Adi Granth. There are four instances in the Kartarpur manuscript where Kabir's verses are either crossed out with a pen or obliterated with the use of hartal. We will discuss this issue in detail in order to find out Guru Arjan's editorial concerns leading to the exclusion of these verses. 1. Deletion of Kabir Material from the Adi Granth 1.1 Kabir's Gauri Salok: A shalok was incorporated in a different hand on the right hand cor- ner just below the invocation of Kabir's work entitled Var Sat ("Seven Days") in the Gauri mode, but later on it was obliterated with the use of hartal. This shalok can still be read under the deletion paste. It reads: Salok. There is a pivotal axis (belari, "circular rod") between the lower region and the sky, where there is a crimson fragrant flower. You have not learned those [potent] syllables (akhar) and yet you expect that your fast (roza, "the Muslim fast of Ramzan") will be approved [by the Lord]. (Kartarpur MS, f. 275/1) Here the belari refers to the spinal chord, the main axis of the human body, which is called in yogic terminology meru-danda from the analogy of Mount Meru or Sumeru, believed to be the pivot of the universe (Vaud- ville 1974:130). There is series of chakras or "discs" along the spinal chord in the shape of lotuses (padmas). The "lower region" (dhari) refers to the muladhara-chakra, whereas the "sky" (ambar) refers to the "thousand- petalled lotus" (sahasrara-chakra).</page><page sequence="10">346 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Evidently the shalok reflects the mystical state achieved through the successful performance of the hatha-yoga technique. It seems to be addressed to a Muslim, who may have been observing his fast of Ramzan without any idea of yogic knowledge and practices. Its theme does not fit in the context of Kabir's composition entitled Var Sat. Further, Guru Arjan would never approve this couplet because of its emphasis on the discipline of hatha-yoga. Although it was originally recorded in the Kar- tarpur volume, it was subsequently deemed unworthy of inclusion and was deleted with the use of hartal. 1.2. Kabir's Asa hymn: There is a hymn of Kabir in the Asa raga, which is crossed out with a pen. It is quite certain that C.H. Loehlin was referring to the verses of this hymn when he took notes on the Kartarpur manuscript on 7 July 1946: "Several verses by Kabir in Rag Asa have been obliterated by someone" (94). This hymn reads: Asa Kabir. Look O people! the betrothal of the Lord. Mother has wed her son and she goes with her husband. I am the father and Ram is my son. I am his sister's husband (bahinoi) and Ram is my brother-in-law (sala). Why should I say "Ram" now! Ram is my father-in-law (sasur) and I am Ram's son-in-law (javayyia). Says Kabir: Listen O son! Those people who repeat Ram are the real appraisers (kuta). (3.2.35) (Kartarpur MS, f. 374/2) Clearly, this is one of Kabir's paradoxical (ultabamsi) sayings. Linda Hess maintains that the meaning of ulta is more like "reversed" rather than "upside-down". Typical ultabamsi expressions are based on reversals of roles, personalities, laws of nature: a rabbit eats a lion, a quail conquers a hawk, an arrow strikes the hunter, fire burns in water, and rain falls from earth to sky (Hess and Singh: 145). In the present case mother weds her son, Kabir is the father, and Ram is his son. Or Kabir is Ram's sister's hus- band (bahinoi) and Ram is his brother-in-law (sala). Kabir seems to have inherited this language of paradoxes and enigmas from the Sahajiyas and Naths, and adapted it to his own purpose (Vaudville 1993:109-130). These paradoxical statements of Kabir may have been designed to stir up his audience with surprises (acharaj) so that he can play with his hear- ers/readers and create in them the sense of immediacy of experience. The reason for the obliteration of this hymn in the Kartarpur volume does not appear to be linked with its paradoxical nature. There are a number of such hymns to be found in the Adi Granth (Kabir, Basant 3 &amp; Gauri 14, AG: 1194 &amp; 326). Rather, the issue in the present case appears to be the use of such strong words as sala ("brother-in-law") and sasur</page><page sequence="11">Singh: Scriptural Adaptation in the Adi Granth 347 ("father-in-law") for "Ram," which form part of abusive language in Pun- jabi culture. This is hardly the language of self-abasement or the poetics of humility or even respect, which is characteristic of the Adi Granth. Kabir, who had to face the daily scorn of the pandits of Banaras because of his low caste, developed a caustic and blunt style (Hess and Singh:10-11; Hess: 112-165). He frequently becomes offensive to his audience, which might go well with a solitary spiritual seeker. It is, however, certainly not the style of the Sikh Gurus, who had a deep sense of social mission and the idea of an organized religious community. Whatever the original context2 of this hymn might have been, Guru Arjan, it seems, decided to exclude it because it did not match the spiritual tone and meaning of the Adi Granth. 1.3. Kabir's Sorathi hymn: There are only two lines of Kabir's hymn in Sorathi raga that were recorded in the Adi Granth and were then crossed out with a pen. These two lines appear in the Kartarpur volume as follows: O Audhu! That Yogi is my Guru, Who clarifies the meaning of this word (pad) to me. (1). Refrain. Clearly, this verse is addressed to an audhu (or avadhuta), "one who has shaken off [the ties of samsara]" (Vaudville 1974:125). Here Kabir offers to become the disciple of a yogi who might reveal the esoteric meaning of a particular hymn (pad) to him. To entertain such an idea of accepting a yogi as Guru would amount to exposing the community of householders to the Nath tradition. This seems to be the main reason why this particu- lar verse was crossed out with a pen in the text of the Kartarpur manu- script and why the remainder of the hymn was not recorded. Some of the manuscripts of the Adi Granth do not contain even these two lines.3 It is important to note that the above verse of Kabir is a part of a hymn, the complete version of which is to be found in some later manu- scripts of the Banno recension of the Adi Granth. The reading of the com- plete hymn is as follows: Sorathi. O Audhu! That Yogi is my Guru, Who clarifies the meaning of this word (pad) to me. (1). Refrain. 2One can argue that this hymn may have originated in response to a Vaishnava's suggestion to repeat the name of "Ram," the incarnation of Vishnu. Kabir may have replied: "Why on earth shall I say "Ram" now when he is my brother-in-law (sala) or father-in-law (sasur)?" In his compositions, Kabir explicitly repudiates this anthropomorphic "Ram." For him, "Ram" is primarily a sound, a mantra consisting of the long and short syllable "Ra-ma" (Hess and Singh:4). 3 For instance, see Punjabi University Museum, MS # 6, f. 298b. In the Una Sahib MS # 2 (pre- served at Una Sahib, HP, in the possession of the Bedi family), the verse is written in the margin of folio 253a in a different hand as a later thought.</page><page sequence="12">348 Journal of the American Academy of Religion There is a tree standing without roots, which bears fruit without flowering. There are no branches or leaves of that [tree], still [a flower of] eight lotuses blooms. (1). There are two birds sitting at a pool, one of them guru and the other disciple. The disciple has picked and eaten [the fruit of] the whole world; the guru has enjoyed the sport within. (2). In the cave of the sky there is an inverted well, which is the abode of the nectar. The intelligent one drinks the nectar to the fill, while the one who lacks a guru (nigura) remains thirsty. (3). After reflection Kabir says: The sport of the bird is just like the way of a fish. I have seen a unique form (murati) within the external appearance (surat), for which I sacrifice myself to the True Guru. (4.9) (John Rylands Library, Panj. MS # 5, f. 216b)4 Evidently, the whole hymn is full of Tantric language and concepts. The eight lotuses (ast-kanwal) refer to the highest of the astral nerve centers (chakras) through which the kundalini power rises. The references to the "cave in the sky" (gagan gupha) and the "inverted well" (uradh mukh kua) of nectar point towards the state of supra-consciousness to which the yogis aspire (Schomer:82-83). Further, there are some paradoxical statements (ultabamsi) too: the tree standing without roots and bearing fruit without flowering, and a bird following the way of a fish. Obviously these state- ments are intended to convey an experience which defies logic. These eso- teric teachings of Tantric Yoga would scarcely be acceptable to Guru Arjan. 1.4. Kabir's Salok: Although an extra shalok was incorporated in the Kartarpur volume at the end of Kabir's shaloks in a different hand, it was crossed out with a pen. An editorial comment explains that "this shalok is just an ordinary one" (ih salok aime hai). Obviously it was not approved by Guru Arjan. The shalok reads: What can one take in return, Kabir, for revealing the mystery (ram nam ke patantarai) of the divine Name? What [gift of mine] could please the Guru who provides contentment? I am just surrendering [my self] within. (Kartarpur MS, f. 943/2) 4The whole hymn is obliterated with the use of hartal, but it could still be read with some help from the following manuscripts: Guru Granth Sahib Trust, Coventry, U.K., MS # 504, f. 319a and Tarlok Singh Choudary's Private Collection, Harrow, U.K., MS # 3, f. 277a.</page><page sequence="13">Singh: Scriptural Adaptation in the Adi Granth 349 The word patantara stands for the "contents of an official document" which are confidential in nature (Shackle 1981:179). In the present con- text Kabir employs it in connection with the mystery of the divine Name, which refers to the contemporary esoteric practice of giving nam ("Name") to the disciples who belonged to the inner Sant circles. He further pro- claims that the divine Name is itself a priceless gift and that no present could repay it. He may also be referring to the Indian tradition of guru- daksina, according to which it is customary for the disciple to make an offering to his teacher once he has received the Name in the form of a sacred mantra (Vaudeville 1974:151, n. 2). There are at least two possible reasons why Guru Arjan disapproved of this couplet. First, the theme of the shalok is linked with the esoteric practice of giving the nam secretly, which had no place in the contempo- rary Sikh practice. The Gurus freely "distributed" (vartae) the gift of the nam in holy congregation (M1, Maru 8, AG:991; M3, Var Vadahans, 2:18, AG:593; and M5, Gauri Guareri 100, AG: 185-6. Also see Hans:68). Guru Nanak's observation is particularly significant in this context: "A curse on the life of those who write the nam [as an incantation on a piece of paper] and sell it [for profit]" (M1, Var Sarang 1:20, AG:1245). Secondly, it did not fit well into the total context of Kabir's shaloks in the Adi Granth. Its later addition at the end and subsequent deletion may suggest that it did not appeal to Guru Arjan who considered it less perceptive and thereby took the decision to exclude it. 2. The Mira Bai Hymn Mira Bai's hymn is another textual problem in the Adi Granth which has drawn a great deal of scholarly attention in the Kartarpur-Banno debate, a debate that started with G.B. Singh's work Sri Guru Granth Sahib dian Prachin Biran (1944). The author challenged the authenticity of the Kartarpur bir without examining the manuscript itself and sug- gested that the Banno recension represents the original text (McLeod 1975:59-82). Although Mira Bai's hymn is written in the Kartarpur vol- ume in a different hand, it has been obliterated with a pen. Obviously the hymn was originally there, but was subsequently deemed unworthy of inclusion, and hence it was crossed out. It is not to be found in the earli- est extant copy of the Kartarpur manuscript, which was apparently pre- pared during Guru Arjan's period (Pashaura Singh 1991:35-38). This indicates that the decision to exclude Mira Bai's hymn must have been made by Guru Arjan himself. Also, there is a very significant marginal note in Ram Rai's bir (written in 1659 CE), which belongs to the Kartar- pur tradition, mentioning specifically that "Mira Bai's hymn is not to be found in the Granth of the fifth Guru" (G.B. Singh: 169). The manuscripts of both the Lahore and Kartarpur traditions of the Adi Granth do not contain the hymn of Mira Bai at all.</page><page sequence="14">350 Journal of the American Academy of Religion All copies of the Banno version of the Adi Granth include the Mira Bai hymn. It appears in the Kartarpur manuscript on folio 811/1 as fol- lows: Mira Bai. The Lotus-Eyed Lord [with his attributes] has entwined my man (heart- mind-soul), O mother. (1) Refrain. The sharp arrow [of his love] has pierced my body through, O mother. I did not know when it struck me; now it cannot be endured, O mother. (1) Though I use charms, incantations, and medicines the pain will not depart. Is there anyone who will treat me? Intense is the agony, O mother. (2) You are near to me, you are not distant; come quickly to meet me. Mira's Lord, the Mountain Lifter, who has quenched the fire of my body, O mother. The Lotus-eyed Lord has entwined [my man with the twine of his] attributes, O mother. (3) (Translation adapted from Macauliffe:356) It is important to note that this is the oldest record of Mira's poem to be found in the early seventeenth-century manuscript (Hawley and Juergen- smeyer:202-203, n. 9). The phrase apne gun ("with his attributes") is not to be found in the Kartarpur manuscript, although it appears in the later manuscripts of the Banno text. Evidently, the central theme of this hymn is Krishna bhakti. The Lotus-Eyed Lord (kaval nainu), an epithet of Krishna, was apparently the object of Mira Bai's special worship. She fur- ther employs an expanded version of her signatures--"Mira's Lord the Mountain Lifter" (mira giradhar suami)--which clearly indicates that the image of Krishna as the Mountain Lifter is the one she holds most dear (Hawley and Juergensmeyer: 131). The main focus of the hymn is on the theme of the pangs of separation from the divine beloved, Krishna. The intensity of this anguish reaches its climax in the symbolism of sharp arrows causing wounds in the body. The phrase tan ki tapati bujhai ("quenched the fire of my body") points towards the erotic nature of Mira's love for Krishna. Elsewhere, an echo of this theme is found in Mira's verses as follows: "I am playing hide and seek with Him, robed in this smock of five colors. Disguised as I was, He caught me, and beholding His beauty I made myself over to Him, body and soul" (Alston:42). It is important to note that the erotic symbolism in the compositions of the Gurus is toned down from the romantic love expressed by Mira Bai in her poetry (Khalsa:72). This may be one of the reasons why Guru Arjan excluded her hymn from the Sikh scripture. The second reason seems to be Mira Bai's emphasis on Krishna bhakti, which is contrary to the Sikh devotional approach towards the non-incarnated Akal Purakh (McLeod 1968:214). A third reason may be linked with</page><page sequence="15">Singh: Scriptural Adaptation in the Adi Granth 351 Guru Arjan's editorial policy to keep the Sikh tradition removed from the Vaishnava influence. 3. The Sur Das Hymn The third major issue in the Kartarpur-Banno debate is linked with the incomplete nature of Sur Das's hymn, the first line of which is recorded in the Kartarpur manuscript in the sarang mode, followed by Guru Arjan's comment on Sur Das. It created a great deal of confusion for later scribes who struggled with this textual problem and offered varying solutions to it. First, most of the scribes of the Lahore tradition did not record even the single line in their copies of the Adi Granth.5 Second, some scribes recorded the single line unconventionally after Guru Arjan's comment on Sur Das.6 Third, some scribes omitted the single line of Sur Das, but they attributed Guru Arjan's hymn to Sur Das instead.7 Fourth, later scribes of the Banno text recorded Sur Das's complete hymn in their copies of the Adi Granth.8 All of these scribes failed to understand Guru Arjan's editorial policy. The single line of Sur Das's hymn is to be found in the Kartarpur manuscript on folio 885/2, followed by a blank space. It is worth noting that early manuscripts of the Banno recension also contain only the single line.9 Its reading is as follows: Soul (man), turn your back on those who shun the Lord. The opening line of Sur Das's hymn stresses the urgent need to com- pletely cut oneself off from the company of those people who have shunned the Lord. This line inspired a response from Guru Arjan, and this is the main reason why he retained it in the Adi Granth while he excluded the remaining lines of the hymn. This unique instance illumi- nates two different aspects of Guru Arjan's editorial policy, namely the exclusive and inclusive attitudes towards the compositions of the Bhagats. 5Guru Nanak Dev University Library, MS # 1084 (1666 CE), f. 351b (or 337a, second numbering); Punjabi University Museum, Jograj MS (1667 CE), PUM # 2, f. 583b; British Library, MSS OR. 2159 (1745 CE), f. 721a (or 718a). 6Una Sahib MS # 2 (seventeenth century), f. 493b; Punjabi University Museum, MS # 6 (1692 CE), f. 525b; British Library, MSS OR. 2748 (early nineteenth century), f. 690b (or 680b). 7 Guru Nanak Dev University Library, MS # 1084, f. 398b (or 384a); British Library, MSS ADD. 25,680 (early nineteenth century), f. 688a (721a). 8 Kanpur MS (1642 CE), f. 414a (originally there was only the single line, but some other hand completed the hymn much later); India Office Library, MSS Panj.

It reads as fol- lows: Soul (man), turn your back on those who shun the lord. Tell me, what good is there in giving cobras milk? Serpents can never surrender their venom. (1) Refrain. Why waste camphor by feeding it to crows or squander the water of the Ganges on dogs? Why array an ass in an aromatic scent? Why bejewel a monkey? (1) Do you really think an arrow can pierce a fallen stone, even if you empty your quiver of them all? Says Sur Das: "Once you've dyed a blanket black, there's no point hoping for a different hue." (2). (Sri Guru Granth Sahib Trust, Coventry, MS # 506, f. 740b. Translation of this hymn is adapted from Hawley: 135)10 Clearly, Sur Das, like Kabir, describes the obstinacy and heedlessness of sinners in the formulaic expressions: "You can't pierce a stone with an arrow," and "If you dye a blanket black, the color will never change" (Hawley: 135). Here Sur Das appears to be strongly opposed to any kind of association with sinners. For him, sinners are totally lost, and for them the doors of liberation are closed. Sur Das's view is directly opposed to the optimistic Sikh view that it is never too late to turn towards Akal Purakh and that every sinner is a potential sant. This seems to be the reason why Guru Arjan accepted only the first line of Sur Das's hymn and edited out the rest of the hymn. How- ever, he offered his response to the issue raised in Sur Das's hymn. His comment reads: Sarang Mahala 5 Sur Das. By the grace of the Eternal One, the True Guru. The devotees of the Lord (har lok) abide with Him (alone). They dedicate their mind, body, and everything else to Him and remain joyously intoxicated by the divine music of the Word (dhuni, "mel- ody"). (1). Refrain. They are relieved of all evil at the [mere] sight of the Lord; [from Him] they receive all that they need. They have nothing to do with anything else except for the sight of [His] beautiful form. (1) Those who, discarding the Beauteous Lord (siam sundar), seek anything else are like leeches sucking leper's blood. 10 Hawley's translation is based on a hymn of Sur Das (written in Devanagri), the first line of which begins tajau man hari-bimukhan kau sang. The Adi Granth version has the Punjabi synonym chhadi for the word tajau. This hymn is to be found in the early manuscripts on Sur Das as follows: B3, U1, J2, J4, Al and Sabha 332. For details, see Hawley:196.</page><page sequence="17">Singh: Scriptural Adaptation in the Adi Granth 353 O Sur Das! the Lord has grasped my man (heart-mind-soul) in His hand, and has granted me [the everlasting joy of] the spiritual world (parlok). (2.1.8.). (M5, Sarang Sur Das, AG: 1253) Here, by employing the phrase siam sundar ("Beauteous Lord"), an epi- thet of Krishna, Guru Arjan is addressing Sur Das in his own terms. But Giani Gurdit Singh wrongly attributes this hymn to Sur Das Madan Mohan, a different poet from Sur Das. There is no thematic or verbal cor- respondence (except the rhyme-scheme) between this hymn and Sur Das Madan Mohan's hymn which he quotes from the Har Sahai pothi (Gurdit Singh:584-5). This hymn is clearly Guru Arjan's comment on Sur Das. Guru Arjan stresses the point that saintly people (har lok) always abide in the company of Akal Purakh who is mystically present in holy fellowship. In contrast with Sur Das, Guru Arjan's emphasis falls upon highlighting the goodness of the saintly people rather than upon the wickedness of sinners. He does employ the highly figurative expression of "leeches sucking leper's blood" (kusti tanijok) to describe the pathetic condition of those who shun the "Beauteous Lord" (siam sundar). In the final analysis, however, he provides them with the hope to come out of their present predicament, and he invites them to become part of the Sikh sangat ("congregation") and to enjoy the state of blissful sahaj ("spontaneous" or "natural," the ultimate condition of mystical union with the divine, achieved when the spirit ascends to sach khand or the "realm of truth") through devotional singing. IV This analysis has demonstrated that it was Guru Amar Das who was primarily responsible for the introduction of the bhagat bani in the Sikh scriptural tradition. He seems to have done this to enlarge the base of the early Sikh community by stressing social equality Guru Arjan made fur- ther selection of the bhagat bani when he prepared the "final" text of the Adi Granth. Indeed, some of the Bhagat material was "edited out" through the process of selection and "deletion" at that time. Evidently Guru Arjan was concerned with identifying the circles from which a particular compo- sition emanated as well as with its message. In other words, he was not only concerned with "who" said it, but also with "what" was being said in a particular composition. Indeed the hymns of the Bhagats from the saguna ("with attributes") school, which places emphasis upon worship through image and myth, were least acceptable to Guru Arjan. Thus the hymns of Mira Bai and Sur Das (except the opening line) were excluded mainly because they were both worshippers of the amorous and anthropo-</page><page sequence="18">354 Journal of the American Academy of Religion morphic Krishna. He even rejected those hymns of the Sants of nirguna ("without attributes") school that were colored with Vaishnava or Tantric ideals. It is important to note that these Sants are otherwise included in the Sikh scripture. This process of the selection of the bhagat bani highlights both exclusive and inclusive aspects of Guru Arjan's editorial policy. In other words, the selection logic favors those poems of the medieval Bha- gats that stress nirguna ("formless divinity") religiosity and social equality, and are in general conformity with the Sikh Gurus' line of thinking. The inclusion of the bhagat bani in the Adi Granth further illuminates the doctrinal concerns of the Sikh Gurus. Evidently, the process of its integration in the Sikh scripture was based upon the recognition of two major points. First, there was its harmony with the Gurus' thought in broad outlines. Second, its differences with the Gurus' thought at essen- tial points were highlighted to demonstrate the distinctive Sikh view- points. These additional reflections of the Gurus were crucial for shaping the emerging Sikh identity. They play an important role in defining what it means to be a Sikh in relation to the commonly held Sant, Sufi, and Bhagat ideals. These points become obvious from the Gurus' comments on the verses of Kabir, Shaikh Farid, Sur Das, and Dhanna. It should be emphasized here that the net effect of the Gurus' comments on the Bha- gats is to cement firmly the bhagat bani in the Sikh scriptural tradition. Although a clear distinction is maintained between the writings of the Bhagats and those of the Gurus, the bhagat bani has always been part of Sikh worship in the congregational setting. In sum, the Sikh scriptures are among the most recent to emerge within the world's religious traditions, and the pattern of assimilation, redaction, and canonization are remarkably similar to scriptural histories of Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, and other religious communities. Under- standing how the Sikh scriptures emerged therefore tells us much about the process of canonization in general. REFERENCES Allchin, R. Kitavali. London: Allen and Unwin. 1964 Alston, A.J.
