<plain_text><page sequence="1">Technology and Postmodernism: Cybernetic Fiction* DAVID PORUSH I. Between Men and Their Machines: The Fourth Discontinuity "Man is on the threshold of breaking past the discontinuity between himself and machines. In one part this is because man can now perceive his own evolution as inextricably interwoven with his use and development of tools, of which the modern machine is only the furthest extrapolation." In this quote, Bruce Mazlish, an historian of science at M.I.T., identifies what he calls the Fourth Discontinuity, a gap between what is perceived as human and what is perceived as mechanical in the self, a gap which he predicts is about to be effaced or bridged. The three other discontinuities in Mazlish's scheme are those between man and the natural universe (bridged by the' Copernican revolution); between man and the beasts (bridged by the Darwinian revolution); and between man and his unconscious self (bridged by the Freudian revolution). The anxiety that technology poses a specific threat to or competes with something human has been articulated by artists and critics again and again since the Industrial Revolution: the English Lake poets, the French Symbolists, D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, Matthew Arnold, G. K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc, and Lewis Mumford are just a few who have historically taken a firm stand against technological encroachment. More recently, Jacques Ellul, Hannah Arendt, and Marshall McLuhan, as well as innumerable authors of humanistic science fiction, have offered us a vision of a more or less apocalyptic world in which homo faber is converted into homo machina and subjugated by his own fabrications. That science fiction and McLuhan and Kenner (in The Counterfeiters) betray a perverse fascination for and celebration of machines at the same time that they warn against its assaults on expression and freedom points to one of the paradoxes of technology: gazing into the hitherto ineffaceable and unfathomable distance between man and his creations, those writers discover an ambivalence toward man's technological success, a power- ful vertigo produced by this disposition, at once fascinated and revolted. *This paper was originally delivered to the MLA section on Postmodernism and Fiction, December 29, 1978 in New York City. Sub-Stance N' 27, 1980 92</page><page sequence="2">Cybernetic Fiction 93 Postmodernist fiction occupies a similarly paradoxical point between fascination and revulsion. This fiction, devoted in part to an examination of how it came to be (self-reflection), is forced to address the notion that not only man, but the literature he produces and the language he uses, may be nothing more than a machine. II. Cybernetic Fiction Defined and Some Examples It is not surprising, then, that in examining the work of artists who are identifiably postmodern-Barth, Barthelme, Beckett, Coover, and Pynchon- one discovers the obsessive return to stories of men who behave like, think like, are defeated by, fatefully linked to, derived from or turning into machines. These stories share a theme which has long been the province of science fiction: the theme of the Mechanized Man. Postmodernist fiction (which does not exclude science fiction by any means) returns to the theme by rendering it in texts which themselves imitate machines, purport to be machines or "gen- erated" by machines, or are structured like highly polished and integrated mechanical devices. I call this sub-genre of postmodernist fiction "cybernetic fiction." Barth's fiction has been exemplary of this sub-genre. A cybernetic reading of Barth's Giles Goat-Boy reveals that the text is structured in two symmetrical volumes made up of three reels each, those reels indicating computer printout tapes, themselves made up of seven sections each. Similarly, the plot is a symmetrical repetition of a series of seven feats performed by the hero according to instructions given him by the computer, WESCAC, which might also be his progenitor. The instructions involve the hero in a series of tests and dramas, which Barth modeled on Joseph Campbell's blueprint for a hero- machine: if, according to Campbell and Barth, a character were to perform those acts prescribed by the blueprint, he would be a programmed, official mythological hero. In the case of Giles Goat-Boy, the heroic activity is aimed at de-fusing (demystifying, unriddling, interpreting, correlating, resolving the paradoxes of) WESCAC's capacity to bring the University (universe) to an apocalyptic end. Barth's penchant for devising self-reflexive, postmodernist, "machine- generated" texts is further expressed in Lost in the Funhouse and his most recent Letters. Texts like "Autobiography: A Self-recorded Fiction" and "Lost in the Funhouse" make it clear that Barth envisions himself as a sort of homespun tinkerer-mechanic, inventor of word-contraptions, which like the funhouse that gives its name to the collection, are combination Babbage calculator and labyrinthine gimmicks. "Autobiography" tells us that it has been created by the illicit intercourse of voice and machine and, unhappy bastard device, pleads with us to "turn it off." Barth, in an introduction to his own reading of Letters in 1977, commented that his son's work in artificial intelligence at M.I.T. had influenced his own interest in computer texts. Letters was originally designed as an epistolary computer-generated, self-pro-</page><page sequence="3">94 David Porush grammed fiction. The author or human narrator in "Autobiography" and Letters disappears, to be replaced by an eminently clever thinking machine, or cybernaut. This is an act of technological self-effacement like that of the anonymous crafters of Swiss watches with transparent faces and backs. They expose the mechanisms behind the message to show that the mechanism is the message; Barth calls attention to the perfection of his contrivance away from the humanness of his characters, ideas and art. Barth is not alone in his postmodern penchant for cybernetic fiction. Thomas Pynchon applies scientific theory itself-an imitation of true tech- nologists who apply physics to hardware-in deriving a structure for his "entropic" works like V, The Crying of Lot 49, Gravity's Rainbow, and "Entropy." These texts are "entropic" because they are structured according to the principles suggested by dual (analogous) formulas for entropy in thermo- dynamics and information theory. Simply stated, entropy is a concept employed by Pynchon because of the attractiveness of all three of its possible definitions: as a measure of the energy which leaks out of a closed system; as a measure of the uncertainty and competing messages carried by any one symbol in a system of signs; and as a description of the final state of the universe-the degradation of matter and energy to the zero point of form- lessness, patternlessness, and undifferentiation. Pynchon projects these three definitions into his more literary purposes, constructing texts which, respec- tively, run down or wind to an end without winding up or resolving its conflicts; texts which are highly polysemous in all their aspects and therefore are made inaccessible by the number of conflicting interpretations carried by each message; and, finally, texts which are apocalyptic, which suggest a world doomed to End at a final zero-point of culture and man. "Entropy," an early short story by Pynchon, is structured like the classic description of the Maxwell ]Demon experiment. Two closed systems or rooms-one with a wild party and another with a solitary hero watching his bird die-slowly leak energy into one another in a way which is controlled and selected by the author who, in this analogy, plays the role of Maxwell's Demon. The party, like most parties, winds down to a state of utter exhaustion and enervation as the last remaining souls lie about and babble at each other. The bird dies. Simultaneously, the text itself becomes more and more incomprehensible (in imitation of the second understanding of entropy: confused and parallel messages borne by a single set of symbols). The other three Pynchon texts, V, The Crying of Lot 49, and Gravity's Rainbow, are structured as multi-layered searches. V is the search for the incarnation of the iconic V in a woman, a robot, a type of rocket, "Vheissu," (human, cybernaut, machine, apocalypse). The Crying of Lot 49 is a search for the secret postal system--message carriers--which seems to have influenced the course of history since the Renaissance; evidence of the system is discovered everywhere, but the system nowhere. Gravity's Rainbow narrates the search for the system of systems, the military-industrial-war machine which, allied with extrasensory perception, tarot, black magic, and wealth, forces men to act like, serve, and become transcendentally linked to machines (as in the case of rocket bombs falling on the sites of Slothrop's copulations).</page><page sequence="4">Cybernetic Fiction 95 All three novels are highly complex, polysemous, and suggestive of apoca- lypse. In each, the hero or heroine is caught in a universe so richly plotted, inhabiting texts of such systematic design and cross-referential structure, that their discoveries make them acquire a special sort of madness: what they once believed, naively, was a random and free universe, becomes a system so ornate, immense and determined that it becomes an unmappable machine, an unchartable machina incognita. Pynchon's fictions echo Jacques Ellul's pro- phecy for the dark triumph of technological order: "True technique will know how to maintain the illusion of liberty, choice and individuality, but these will be carefully calculated so that they will be integrated into the mathematical reality merely as appearances." Pynchon, therefore, is also a technologist of texts, having mastered the technique of constructing fictional texts that are machines. A third text that begs for cybernetical analysis is Beckett's The Lost Ones. Only fifty-six very dilute pages long, it is the product of four years of intense writing by Beckett. The Lost Ones is a crystalline machine of a fiction, told from a weird, dehumanized point-of-view, the third-person absent omni- scient (e.g., the first sentence: "Abode where lost bodies roam each searching for its lost one.") A good portion of the text is devoted to a series of blueprint instructions describing the contained environment in which the lost ones roam: "a flattened cylinder fifty metres round and eighteen high for the sake of symmetry" containing two hundred bodies, grouped into four categories; temperature and light inside the cylinder oscillate in uncoordinated but regular intervals as the creatures grope through alternate gloom and blinding light, freezing cold and uncomfortable heat. In other words, the cylinder is a huge machine. Beckett details in clinical language the effect of the oscillations in heat and light on the bodies of the lost ones and emphasizes the systematic way the four groups of bodies are organized so that "in the cylinder alone are certitudes to be found and without nothing but mysteries." The beings themselves are enslaved to the mechanical, determined world in which they are trapped, and have become extensions of it; their every sensation and act is subject to the laws of the machine. The only reference to any subject or notion recognizably human and external to the system of the lost ones is to Dante. Like Dante in his portrait of hell, Beckett has created a closed system of some ultimate human fate, some eternal structure of doom. Except that Beckett's hell, unlike Dante's, is entropic, leaking energy into the world at the same infinitesimal rate that a sand dune,, protected from the winds, is diminished: "lessened by three grains every other year and every following increased by two," until "the last of all if a man ... after a pause impossible to time finds at last his place and pose whereupon dark descends and at the same instant temperature comes to rest not far from the freezing point. Hushed in the same breath the faint stridulence mentioned above [the humming of the machine?]... So much roughly speaking for the last state of the cylinder and of this little people of searchers ... ." The Lost Ones is an exemplary cybernetic fiction, using mechanical diction to catalogue a set of dehumanizing data about a large machine and its machine-like occupants. Robert Coover stumbles into cybernetic territory in his short story,</page><page sequence="5">96 David Porush "Morris in Chains." In it, Coover contrasts the highly stylized ruminations of a randy satyr, roaming on the plastic, steel and concrete hull of a pre-fabricated city-park, to the official report, written in bureaucratese by technicians who track, capture and neutralize Morris because of the threat he poses to their ultimately ordered society. "Only rarely did Morris escape our network of observers now, and then but briefly. His least event was recorded on notepad, punchcard, film, tape. Observers reported his noises, odors, motions, choices, acquisitions, excretions, emissions, irritations, dreams." Joseph McElroy in Plus invents a dehumanized point-of-view, which in turn engenders a highly idiosyncratic and reflexive style similar to Beckett's in The Lost Ones. One could call McElroy's position first-person absent as he tells the story of a brain, excised from its human body and launched into orbit around Earth on a computerized platform. The brain, Imp Plus, transmits data back to Earth as it culls information from its electrical inputs. However, as it floats in its glucose bath, it slowly re-invents its human past, rejects its cybernetic role, and, miraculously, grows an array of tentacles, organs, sprouts and stalks which obtain sensuous information for the brain. Imp Plus, in a manner of speaking, grows back into humanness. As a final act of affirmation it terminates its life against the protest of Cap Com (Earth command station) by decaying the orbit of its platform into Earth's atmos- phere and burning up. McElroy's text is weird and highly technologized, filled with data readouts and an imitation computer vocabulary. Barthelme's fiction has continually shown its author's tinkerer's delight in re-assembling the contextless details of a mechanized culture in devices which become strange and ironic montages. One critic calls Barthelme's fictions "verbal machines with all their gears exposed." Barthelme constructs cyber- netic fictions in several instances. One of the most striking is "Paraguay." Like The Lost Ones and Giles Goat-Boy, "Paraguay" is an entire country or world, "not the Paraguay on your maps," but a Paraguay of some future imaginative projection, a utopia of "gleaming surfaces." This Paraguay is described in a parody of an atlas, with headings for "Temperature," "Error," "Rationaliza- tion," "Microminiaturization," and "Silence," among others. In Paraguay, "A government error resulting in the death of a statistically insignificant portion of the population.., .has made people uneasy; Art has been 'rationalized,' and each artist's product is translated into a statement in symbolic logic." Barthelme explains the process: Rationalization produces simpler circuits and, therefore, a saving in hard- ware.... The statement is then "minimized" by various clever techniques. The simpler statement is then translated back into the design of a simpler circuit.... Flip-flop switches control further development. Finally, as in The Lost Ones, "temperature controls activity to a remarkable degree." The story is short and haunting, especially in its self-reflexive image of the fate of art in a technologized society.</page><page sequence="6">Cybernetic Fiction 97 III. On Cybernetics, Black Boxes, and Barthelme's "The Explanation" I've been slinging the term "cybernetic" around in this paper, relying on the general notion we have of its meaning. Cybernetics is popularly under- stood to have something to do with wonderful computers and robots, fascinating cybernauts which (or who) incarnate human mentality and abilities in machine form. If you take a dimmer view of the matter, cybernetics represents technology's final encroachment on human freedom. The term, however, bears closer definition. Cybernetics is technically a very precise endeavor. It is the science that compares complex computers to the neurophysiology of the human brain in an attempt to advance the study of both. In other words, it is the science of analogies between what is human and what is machine; however, in its application, it is the technology which endeavors to bridge the Fourth Discon- tinuity between the two by realizing that analogy, or incarnating it, in terms of "hardware." It builds brains. There are two fronts on which this problem is assaulted. First, through the extension of the deterministic explanation for the physiological working of the brain (both in its transmission of messages and its grosser control of human behavior) more than the mechanics of perception and response have been explained. More "human" territories of the brain have been mapped: those controlling speech, ideation, hallucination, dream and creation. (In fact, one of the more recent textbooks on the subject is entitled The Enlightened Machine.) On the second front, technologists in artificial intelligence have designed and programmed computers capable of simulating speech, per- forming mathematics operations in n dimensions (n &gt; 3), playing chess better than masters, and, what is more to our purpose, "reading and writing" literary texts. These latter experiments in computer reading and composition of literary texts have in part been made possible by a cousin science, not normally considered a branch of cybernetics: structuralism. Though structuralism has had important effects on anthropology, comparative mythology, literary criticism and the like, its primary assumption remains that language is a machine. The structuralist critic extends the argument to assume that the grandest product of this grand machine is another machine, the literary text, one more highly specialized and idiosyncratic. It is from this cybernetic assumption that the researchers of the interface between computers and literature proceed in their investigations. It is also from a similar assumption that Gilles Deleuze deduces that Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu "is not only a instrument but a machine." Deleuze echoing and extending Proust's self-reflexive discussion of The Search, declares that "it is a sonata, a cathedral, a gown, ... a cryptogram which decodes and encodes all our social, diplomatic and strategic, erotic and aesthetic languages. [It is] a western, a wacky comedy, ... anything we like as long as we make the whole thing work." That is, Deleuze seems to say, the machine in literature is not the mechanical operation of author on text, nor the autonomous text itself</page><page sequence="7">98 David Porush as it exists in and of its own structure, but the operation of the reader on the text. It is "we" who make "the whole thing work." We make it work by making it over in our own image, or at least, in the image of our own scrutiny. Interpretation transforms the postmodernist text-which invites such inter- pretation-into an overdetermined grid of intersecting, competing and parallel systems of meaning which arise from and mirror the expectations of the reader. In this understanding of cybernetic fiction, the reader is again placed astride the Fourth Discontinuity. This time, however, it is not by the subject of the text (robots, etc.), nor so much by its inherent structure (Barth's computer reels), but by the reader's interpretation itself. The attempt to make a text work makes it into a phenomenological machine. "The modern work of art," Deleuze writes, "is anything it seems to be; it is even its very property of being whatever we like, of having the overdeter- mination of whatever we like. The modern work of art is a machine and functions as such." Postmodernism goes one step further. Postmodernist authors are concerned with the mechanics of their fiction in recognition of this notion. They taunt their readers with the impossibility of ever really being sure that their interpretation is single by making fictions which are disguised as machines but are loaded with hidden systems, paradoxes, ambiguities, non- sequiturs, and tautologies. Trying to interpret all the allegorical and allusive properties of The Lost Ones is an essay in madness. Barth is well known for his love of analogical games, paradoxical structures. The cybernetics of post- modernist fiction is a playful treachery; it may look like a machine, it may talk about its own mechanics or about Mechanized Man himself, but it functions as something more than a machine, something inexplicable. It works, but the reader doesn't know how. There is a name for this sort of machine, one which works to invite interpretation but which is itself too elusive to be interpreted singly and unambiguously, too ornate to be wholly described, too minute and numerous in its particulars to be measured or mapped. This mysterious machine is, in engineering jargon, the black box. When engineers draw a diagram of a complicated machine, they use a symbol to indicate those junctures where none of the details are rendered because they are too complex for the scale of the drawing; they draw a black box to stand for the operation of the machine and then label it with that operation. The black box, then, indicates what is supposed to occur in the final product, not how or why. The next engineer down the line would read the label, translate it into a diagram that would "make it work." The ideal reader. However, black boxes are not just shorthand for highly complex machines too detailed to diagram. They also signify, to scientists and analysts, the point at which a deterministic or technical explanation breaks down. They stand for the statement: "We know it works but we don't know how." It is this sort of black box which postmodernist fiction imitates. If these analogies and conjurations and borrowings from technology seem contrived, then consider for a moment Barthelme's story with the suggestive</page><page sequence="8">Cybernetic Fiction 99 title, "The Explanation." It is placed in a particularly elusive collection of short stories, City Life, perhaps Barthelme's best, certainly his most experi- mental in terms of formal devices and brave games with inaccessibility and nonsense. In it, a large black box is reproduced on several pages surrounded by written text. The writing is a parody of the interview form, perhaps the most mechanical form of that most mechanical novelistic device, the dialogue. The interviewer and interviewee are identified only by the anonymous "Q" and "A" in place of names. Q seems to be interviewing A on his response to the black box, which appears above them on the page. They refer to it as a "machine": Q. Do you believe that this machine could be helpful in changing the government? A. I don't know what it does, what does it do? Q. Well, look at it. A. It offers no clues. Q. It has a certain reticence. A. I don't know what it does. Q. A lack of confidence in the machine? Is Barthelme addressing the "reticence" of his own texts to yield to interpretation? It would seem so. The exchange between Q and A is filled with non-sequiturs, broken answers and nonsensical repetitions, but they always return to a discussion of the machine. A. begins to see in it a woman slowly undressing, a striptease image for the enticement of the reader by the text and the pleasures promised him or her; but is also an image for the hallucination of the reader. A. sees a woman removing her bra, but the box remains black. "Q It has beauties. / A The machine." At the center of the fiction, Q draws attention to the "explanation" behind "The Explanation." This explanation draws explicit connections between the black box, cybernetics, and the fiction itself. Q states: "I have a number of error messages I'd like to introduce here and I'd like you to study them carefully.., .they're numbered. I'll go over them with you." He then lists a series of coded instructions borrowed from a computer programming man- ual. These instructions, or "error messages," are used by the programmer at that most meaningful point in the drama between man and machine: when the machine corrects the fallible man. Error messages are the responses by a computer to nonsensical or uninterpretable programming instructions. Bar- thelme tips his hand to the reader by choosing those messages which are double entendres for literary terms and could be applied to the way an author "programs" his fiction: "improper sequence of operators ... missing operator ... mixed mode, that one's particularly grave.., .improper characters in constant ... invalid character transmitted in a sub-program stateme. .. that's a bitch . . . no END statement." The words "character," "operator," "END statement," and "mixed mode" hint at the self-reflexiveness of Barthelme's project. But there is nothing ambiguous in Barthelme's message about the interpretation of his own text: his fiction is a mysteriously working machine, a black box which the answerer, the reader, explains.</page><page sequence="9">100 David Porush Where, then, in Barthelme's scheme of machines and black boxes and the like, is there room for the human? Is his explanation the same as Coover's and Barth's and Beckett's and the other cybernetic postmodernist fiction writers, that humanity has been taken away from men and women and placed in the hands of the machines that imitate them? When Q states, "The face... the machine has a face," the reader is prompted to look, even though the machine is only a black box. Q, the defender of the machines, seems to address this displacement of the human by the technological in literature: "I don't like to use anthropomorphic language in talking about these machines, but there is one quality... ." "What is it?" A asks: "Q It's brave. / A Machines are braver than art." Even A is reluctant but finally admits the attraction of machines over art for citizens like A, who give their assent to them. Yet, A saw something quite un-machinelike in the black box: a striptease by a beautiful woman, a face, bravery. IV. A Rhetorical Epilogue on Cybernetic Fiction as Inoculation There is something about these highly specialized postmodernist black box fiction machines which is brave. They are more daring than other fictions, perhaps; they court nonsense, chaos, paradox, entropy, silence and oblivion. They ask to be misunderstood, misinterpreted-though creatively. And though they are quite vociferous about the mechanics and "advanced technology" (or technique) of their own design, this is no more than an invitation to the reader to enter into a relationship with the text which will return the reader to his or her ,own humanness. The reader, like Barthelme's somewhat befuddled A, projects, hallucinates or interprets the impenetrable and unyielding obscurity of the black box to mean something human; the reader sees in it not only a face (perhaps or perhaps not the face of the reader) or a striptease or bravery, but the enduring assurance that as long as there are black boxes there will always be something the mechanics and technicians and determinists can't explain. Cybernetic fiction, by anticipating the effacement of the discontinuity between man and machine, inoculates against the post- modern disease of technological determinism.</page></plain_text>
