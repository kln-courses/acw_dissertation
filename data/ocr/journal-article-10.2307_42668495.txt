<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Development of Iron Age Coinage in Belgie Gaul COLIN HASELGROVE [plates 17-19] INTRODUCTION In a companion article which appeared in the Chronicle a few years ago, I referred to a number of recent Iron Age coin finds on the continent which had a significant bearing on our understanding of developments in Britain.1 Over two decades have elapsed since Simone Scheers compiled her corpus of the coinages issued by the peoples of Belgie Gaul before and after their conquest by Julius Caesar's armies in 57-51 bc, during which time an enormous amount of new material has come to light within the areas of northern France, Germany and the Low Countries included in her survey.2 As in Britain, the two main factors responsible for this upsurge have been large-scale archaeological excavations at Iron Age settlements and especially religious sites,3 and widespread use of metal detectors. Finds include a substantial number of hitherto unknown types or varieties, providing important new insights into the nature of monetary developments in different areas, while many minor Belgie series are now much better defined than previously.4 At the same time, the recovery of numerous coins in well-defined archaeological contexts has finally enabled many issues to be independently dated, indicating that they are often significantly earlier than had appeared the case when Scheers was writing during the 1970s.5 Scheers, like other continental scholars, relied heavily on the absolute chronology for Gaulish coinages elaborated by the late J.-B. Colbert de 1 C. Haselgrove, 'The development of British Iron Age coinage', NC 153 (1993), pp. 31-64. 2 S. Scheers, Traité de numismatique celtique II: la Gaule Belgique (Paris, 1977).

Widespread minting, he argued, post-dated the Roman defeat of the Arverni of central Gaul in 121 bc. Until this point, the economic dominance of this people enabled them to maintain a near monopoly over monetary developments in Gaul and it was the chaos following their defeat which allowed other groups to start minting their own coinages.7 A central tenet of Colbert de Beaulieu's scheme was his proposition that base metal coinage, including the prolific cast bronze issues known as potin on account of their high tin content, did not appear before the Gallic war,8 while the striking of gold coinage was held to have ceased everywhere following the Roman conquest. Within this framework, dating individual series depended very largely on linking particular sites, hoards or coin types with known individuals or historical events, or by showing that typological borrowing from Roman issues had occurred.9 The best known 'fixed point' for Gaulish coinage, provided by over 600 Gaulish and Roman coins found in the 1862-65 excavations initiated by Napoléon III at the site of Alésia where Caesar finally defeated Vercingetorix and his Gaulish army in 52 bc,10 is however of limited relevance for Belgie Gaul. Less than 3 % of the Alésia finds come from this region, too low a proportion for any chronological significance to be attached to the absence of other Belgie types.11 Issues which can be 6 Scheers, Traité , pp. 17-18. The fullest exposition of Colbert de Beaulieu's thesis is contained in his Traité de numismatique celtique I: Méthodologie des ensembles (Paris, 1973); for a summary, 'Umlauf und Chronologie der gallo-keltischen Münzen', JNG 16 (1966), pp. 45-62. 7 For a critical review, see D. Nash, 'The chronology of Celtic Coinage in Gaul; the Arvernian "Hegemony" reconsidered', NC 135 (1975), pp. 204-18. 8 Colbert de Beaulieu's dating never found favour with the late Derek Allen, who argued that Gaulish potin developed in the second century bc; see 'British potin coins; a review', in D. Hill and M. Jesson (eds), The Iron Age and its hillforts (Southampton, 1971), pp. 127-54, and Colbert de Beaulieu's reply, 'Chronologie des bronzes Gaulois et British potin coins' RBN 119 (1973), pp. 5-41. 9 S.

Scheers, 'La numismatique d'Alésia: quelques précisions', Mélanges Colbert de Beaulieu , pp. 743-51. Most of the Alésia coins were found in the lower of two ditch systems (the fossé inférieur) forming part of the Roman siegeworks at the foot of Mont Rèa, a few coming from locations elsewhere on the circuit. Although the link with the events of 52 bc seems established beyond doubt, it does not follow that all the coins and the weapons found with them were immediately buried in the ditches; some might well be later battlefield offerings. 11 Only 7 Belgie coins came from the ditch deposits: 1 silver (Scheers 55), 4 bronze (Scheers 146 (2), 155, 163); and 2 potin (Scheers 185, 186). The finds also included 6 LT 7388-7405 potins; although omitted from Scheers's corpus, site finds show that this series circulated extensively in southern Belgie Gaul, although its home may be slightly further south. Apart from</page><page sequence="3">IRON AGE COINAGE 113 securely linked with leaders cited in Caesar's commentaries are similarly confined to Celtic Gaul, no Belgie coinages being unambiguously identifiable with the individuals to whom he refers.12 In the post-Conquest period, a few Belgie issues do carry the name of Roman generals like Aulus Hirtius, but precise dating is still elusive.13 Even dating issues which imitate Roman coinage is not straightforward; at best, copying provides only a terminus post quem and there is no way of knowing how much time elapsed before this occurred; in many cases, more than one prototype is plausible, or the dating of the Roman issue is itself open to question.14 Furthermore, archaeological evidence has shown that various supposed instances of borrowing from Roman coins - which seemed quite plausible under Colbert de Beaulieu's chronology - must now be dismissed.15 With very few exceptions, undisputed imitation of Roman types is confined to inscribed silver and bronze issues belonging to the latter stages of Belgie coinage16 and the few hoards mixing Belgie and Roman issues are similarly late in date. For dating the gold, Scheers relied heavily on the apparent pivot provided by the Gallic war, arguing that underlying similarities between many of the later series reflected an attempt at monetary harmonisation on the part of the Belgie peoples opposed to the Roman invasion. From there, she went on to equate particular coinage episodes with the sequence of events recorded by Caesar.17 While the sheer size of some of the Scheers 163 bronze, which came from the upper ditch (fossé supérieur), the coins were presumably all from the fossé inférieur, although only the Scheers 186 and LT 7388-7405 potins are specifically mentioned in the notes made by de Saulcy as successive consignments of finds reached the Cabinet des Médailles. A third Scheers 146 bronze was found separately on the slopes of Mont Rèa. J.-B. Colbert de Beaulieu, 4 Les monnaies gauloises au nom des chefs mentionnés dans les commentaires de César', Latomus 58 (1962), pp. 419-46. Colbert de Beaulieu accepted the identification of two Belgie silver units inscribed Commios (Scheers 45, 47) with the individual made king of the Atrebates by Caesar (BG IV, 21 etc). The coins occur in the right general area, but the identification was rejected by Allen, who considered that the coins were too late for this Commios; see D. Allen, The Coins of the Ancient Celts (Edinburgh, 1980), p. 98. 13 e.g. Scheers 153 and 162. For further discussion of their date, see n. 186 below. As with the Caesarian elephant denarius, which E. A. Sydenham ( The Coinage of the Roman Republic , London, 1952, No. 1006) dated between 54-51 bc and Crawford (RRC, 443/1) between 49-48 bc. 15 Scheers derived the quadrupeds depicted on Scheers 191 and 195 from the elephant on Crawford 443/1, but stratified finds show that both potin types are much too early for such copying to have occurred; see e.g. C. Haselgrove, 4 Les potins "au personnage courant'", Gallia 52 (1995), pp. 51-9. 16 cf. Scheers, Traité , p. 118, Fig. 17. Additions to her list are the bronze 'ä l'astre' inscribed C.

Some 20 Belgie issues have clearly recognisable Roman prototypes: 3 of silver and 17 of bronze, of which 15 are inscribed. 17 Scheers, Traité , pp. 60-83; idem.

By the same token, Colbert de Beaulieu's premise that gold was not struck in Gaul after the Roman conquest also requires re- examination. AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH Given these uncertainties and in order to produce a chronological framework for Iron Age coinage in Belgie Gaul which is consistent with the available evidence, there is much to be said for adopting an approach similar to the one which I have already used for Britain, whereby developments are considered in terms of broad periods, rather than precise dates. As far as possible, this periodisation should not be built around dates derived from historical events such as the Gallic war, both to avoid prejudging issues of interpretation and to avoid the spurious accuracy which the use of precise dates invariably suggests.20 On the other hand, we cannot expect Iron Age monetary developments to conform neatly to archaeological phases adduced from quite different categories of material evidence. It is highly unlikely that changes in coin types kept perfectly in step with other modifications in material culture, while it is also well established that site finds do not reflect all aspects of coin production and circulation equally well.21 Early Belgie gold types, for example, are very rarely found on excavated sites, and even in the first century bc, stratified gold coins are far from abundant. Any such periodisation must therefore work both from the coins themselves and from their wider archaeological associations. The value of archaeological evidence lies in providing a secure terminus ante quern for the issue of coin types which occur consistently in stratified 18 Haselgrove, 'Development', pp. 36-9; A.

Archaeological evidence is not, however, without problems of its own, which must not be overlooked. First of all, the presence of a coin in an archaeological deposit cannot tell us how much time elapsed between the minting of the coin and when it was lost - which might be considerable. Moreover, as Pion has stressed, the only terminus ante quern we can safely apply is the latest possible calendar date for the end of the relevant cultural phase; although the individual deposit might well be earlier.22 Second, and no less important is the phenomenon of residuality. Very few coins can be definitely shown to be at their original point of deposition. Instead, most come from secondary contexts, like pits and ditches, having originally been lost or discarded elsewhere at an earlier date.23 This is a major problem on religious sites just as much as settlements, and is particularly relevant in Belgie Gaul, given the upsurge of new building on existing sites of all kinds in the reign of Augustus, which resulted in widespread disturbance of earlier deposits. In this respect, coins deliberately included in burials as grave goods have a particular chronological value, although they too can be old when buried and the burials are subject to the same rules with respect to terminus ante quern as any other archaeological deposit.24 The principal effect of these factors is to create a potential time lag between the date at which a new coin type was introduced and dating based on the earliest stratified deposits in which examples occur. The discrepancy is likely to be most acute for coinages first put into circulation near the end of one cultural phase and more likely therefore to be found in archaeological contexts dating to the following cultural phase. Conversely, where a coin type is plentiful in deposits of a given date, we can be confident that the series was in widespread circulation well before the end of that phase and - if the phase is short -might even have been introduced in the previous one. Nevertheless, we should always beware of special pleading with regard to 22 P. Pion, ' Les caractères généraux et l'évolution de la circulation monétaire en Gaule nord- orientale aux IIer et Ier siècles avant J.-C. in J. Metzler and D. Wigg (eds), Die Kelten und Rom : neue numismatische Forschungen, Studien zu Fundmünzen der Antike (Berlin, forthcoming). 23 Haselgrove, Iron Age Coinage , pp. 38-9; 71-2. There is still a regrettable tendency on the part of numismatists dealing with Iron Age coinage to ignore the phenomenon of residuality, accepting coins found in late deposits at face value as evidence of continued use. Establishing whether this is likely requires careful analysis of the full range of archaeological contexts in which the coin type occurs. In the case of Scheers 191 potins, for example, the relative lack of coins in later first century bc contexts implies that finds from later contexts are residual; Haselgrove, 'Les potins au personnage courant', p. 58, fig. 19. For an inventory of older finds, see H.Polenz, 'Münzen in latènezeitlichen Gräbern Mitteleuropas aus der Zeit zwischen 300 und 50 vor Christi Geburt', Bayerische Vorge- schichtsblätter 47 (1982), pp. 28-222. There have been important new finds, at Acy-Romance, and the Lamadeleine cemetery outside the Titelberg (Luxembourg).</page><page sequence="6">116 COLIN HASELGROVE particular issues, or avoid placing undue weight on individual finds. There is always a danger of a single coin being intrusive in an earlier deposit; or of the context itself being incorrectly dated.25 It is therefore vital that chronological arguments are based around those coinages for which there is enough archaeological evidence to make the possibility of such biases remote, as is already the case with certain Belgie series and should in the fullness of time become true of others. In recent years, later Iron Age chronology in Belgie Gaul has been the subject of several major studies,26 all of which are in close agreement. The framework now in use divides the closing centuries of the Iron Age into seven principal cultural phases, and for its absolute dating has the support of several tree-ring dates, as well as linking in with the chronologies used in central and southern France, where Italian imports are plentiful. Allowing a degree of uncertainty of at least 10 years either way, the likely dates for the start and end of each major horizon are as follows: La Tène Cl, c.275-200bc; La Tène C2, c.200-150bc; La Tène Dia, c.150-120bc, La Tène Dib, c. 120-90 bc; La Tène D2a c.90-60 bc; La Tène D2b, c.40-30 bc; earliest Gallo-Roman, c.30-1 bc.27 Even if the absolute dates have to be adjusted in the future, as they probably will, the successive cultural phases provide a sound basis for establishing the relative order of different coin types. It should however be stressed that not all of the phases are equally well represented throughout Belgie Gaul, and that the dates at which each particular transition occurred will have varied somewhat in different parts of the region. Discussion must perforce rely heavily on those areas where the archaeological sequence is most complete. Some of the best evidence for dating Iron Age coinage comes from the valley of the river Aisne on the border between Champagne and Picardy, in northern France (Fig. 1). Here a series of short-lived sites provide successive 'snapshots' of the coin types in circulation at different stages of the later 2nd 25 These hazards apply equally with burial evidence. Many older discoveries are only partially documented and the integrity of some of the assemblages is open to debate. 26 B. Lambot and M.

It should, however, be noted that this phasing is not always applied consistently by archaeologists working in different areas, particularly with regards the recognition of a discrete La Tène Dia phase distinct from La Tène C2.</page><page sequence="7">IRON AGE COINAGE 117 &lt;D tí o N (U W) cd tí 8 T3 § C/3 ü 'S S a -a tí ì 43 W5 3 cd O u PQ 2 Pu</page><page sequence="8">118 COLIN HASELGROVE and 1st centuries bc.28 These sites include the large valley-bottom oppida at Condé-sur-Suippe (La Tène Dib) and Villeneuve-St-Germain (primarily La Tène D2a);29 and the celebrated promontory fort at Pommiers. Colbert de Beaulieu regarded the Pommiers coins as an archetypal Gallic War assemblage, but it is now clear that the site was densely occupied in the later first century bc (La Tène D2b-earliest Gallo-Roman).30 Further upstream, the large rural settlement at Acy-Romance (Ardennes) has yielded numerous coin finds in both domestic and funerary contexts dating from La Tène C2 onward.31 In the coastal regions of Picardy, however, particularly around the northern and southern fringes of the Somme basin, the vast majority of Iron Age coin finds come from religious sanctuaries and temples.32 Compared to the short-lived Aisne valley settlements, accurate dating of these finds is fraught with difficulty; deposits were subject to a high degree of later disturbance and the types employed as offerings were in any case not always current. A second area of particular significance for archaeological dating is Luxembourg and the Moselle valley, where several fortified sites, sanctuaries and cemeteries have been excavated in recent years. These include the Titelberg oppidum near Luxembourg, occupied continuously from La Tène Dia, and the important La Tène D2 sanctuaries at Wallendorf and the Martberg-bei-Pommern, over the border in Germany.33 Traditionally, Belgie coinages have been discussed in terms of the groups 28 Cf. V. Guichard, P. Pion et alii, 'A propos de la circulation monétaire en Gaule chevelue au Ile et 1er siècles av. J-C' Rev. Archéol. du Centre de la France 32 (1993), pp. 26-55, where the coin finds from the Aisne Valley sites and short-lived sites in central France are used to provide a overview of the later stages of monetary development in the two regions. 29 Although Jean Debord, one of Villeneuve's excavators, continues to argue a later first century bc date for the site, detailed analysis by Pion, Les habitats Laténiens , vol. I, suggests that the site was established at the end of La Tène Dib and that the principal occupation dates to La Tène D2a; limited activity, however, continued into La Tène D2b. For a recent restatement of Debord's arguments, see 'Le faciès monétaire de Villeneuve-Saint-German et ses éléments de datation', Gallia 52 (1995), pp. 61-78. 30 J.-B.

For many years, Pommiers was thought to be the Noviodunum of the Suessiones beseiged by Caesar in 57 bc (BG II, 12) and was assumed to have been abandoned after the Gallic war. Recent excavations have confirmed that this was not so, while Villeneuve-St-Germain has emerged as an alternative contender for identification as Caesar's Noviodunum.

However, even in these 30 years, important changes had already occurred, and there is no way of knowing to what extent the territorial groupings adopted by the Roman authorities existed as coherent entities prior to the mid first century bc. Particularly for the earlier coinages, attributing individual issues to specific peoples is liable to be at best anachronistic, while relying on the coins themselves to define territorial entities is to engage in a largely circular exercise. Caesar's own testimony implies that Belgie Gaul was culturally and politically unstable,34 and many of the earlier coin types exhibit diffuse, overlapping distributions which bear little resemblance to the Augustan civitas territories. As in Britain, it therefore seems preferable to adopt a neutral nomenclature for discussing the different coin series, while accepting that by the mid to late first century bc a certain number of issues can be fairly securely linked with peoples mentioned in the Roman sources.35 Within Belgie Gaul, four broad coinage zones are distinguishable, although their boundaries are not always clear-cut, and were subject to some degree of change through time. What I shall call the Western zone comprises upper Normandy, Picardy, and Artois. This region equates broadly with the smaller area of territory to which Caesar refers several times as Belgium.26 Many of the successive gold types found here also circulated in quantity in south-east England, indicating close links between the two regions throughout the later Iron Age.37 The second, or Southern zone, covers northern Champagne and the eastern Paris basin; in the mid first century bc, its leading peoples were the Suessiones and the Remi.38 The third or Central zone is in many respects a continuation of the Southern zone, extending northwards from the upper reaches of the river Oise into modern Belgium, and then east to the German border. The Nervii and the other groups to 34 e.g. BG II, 3-4; see also C. Haselgrove, 'The Romanization of Belgie Gaul: some archaeological perspectives', in T. F. C. Blagg and M. J. Millett (eds), The Early Roman Empire in the West (Oxford, 1990), pp. 47-52, 58-62. 5 The only peoples whose names appear on some issues were the Mediomatrici (Scheers 138) ; the Remi (Scheers 146, 147) and the Veliocasses (Scheers 164). 36 e.g. BG V, 12; 24. Groups whom Caesar places in this area include the Ambiani; the Atrebates; the Bellovaci; and the Veliocasses. Delestrée, Monnayages , illustrates many of the new types and varieties which have been found at the Picardv sanctuaries since Scheers' cornus. 37 Scheers Nos 1-5, 8-10; 13; 24, known in Britain as Gallo-Belgic XA and A-E. As Burnett, '"Gallo- Belgie" coins', pp. 9-10, reminds us, we might in certain cases be dealing with British issues exported to the continent and used there, rather than vice versa. Quite apart from what seem to be specifically insular types, a number of Gallo-Belgic types are actually more common in Britain than on the continent (cf. Haselgrove, Iron Age Coinage , p. 69, fig. 5.3), although differential recording may have contributed. The matter cannot at present be resolved, but does not affect the arguments set out here. 38 Pion, Les habitats Laténiens , vol. III, discusses the principal Southern coinages in detail; see also Delestrée, Monnayages , pp. 127-39.</page><page sequence="10">120 COLIN HASELGROVE whom he collectively refers as Germani Cisrhenani were the principal inhabitants of the area in Caesar's day.39 The fourth or Eastern zone runs from the middle Meuse to the Rhine, although some Eastern coinages seem to have circulated east of the Rhine as well. The major groups living here in the mid first century bc were the Treveri, the Mediomatrici, and probably the Leuci.40 The peoples inhabiting the coastal areas in the far north of Belgie Gaul seem to have produced no Iron Age coinages of their own, with the arguable exception of a handful of silver issues found in the Rhine-Meuse delta and ultimately derived from the southern German 'rainbow cup' (Regenbogenschüsselchen) tradition via the Rhineland.41 A NEW PERIODISATION FOR IRON AGE COINAGE IN BELGIC GAUL Drawing on the numismatic and archaeological evidence now available, five main phases of minting and circulation in Belgie Gaul can be recognised, some of which should eventually prove capable of sub-division. Together, these cover the period from the third century bc to the early first century ad (Table 1). Once again, I should stress that not all regional developments conform neatly to the proposed periodisation, which is inevitably more soundly based for the later silver and bronze issues which form the bulk of the site finds than it is for the gold. Inevitably, some coin series span more than one phase, or appear not to be restricted to one specific zone, while even widespread changes may have taken place locally at different times. I shall now review the evidence for each of the stages in more detail. Stage 1 (third century bc) On current evidence, Belgie Gaul lies outside the area of Gaul where the very earliest striking of gold coinages occurred, and when coin production did start, it seems to have been essentially confined to those parts of the Eastern and Western zones bordering the rivers Meuse and Somme respectively. Universally accepted as the earliest indigenous Gaulish coinages are various series of gold staters, and more rarely corresponding half- or quarter-staters, which closely imitate the so-called Philippus coinage with the head of Apollo on the obverse and a two-horse chariot on the reverse struck 39 For a detailed reassessment of the principal coinages found in modern Belgium, see S. Scheers, 4 Frappe et circulation monétaire sur le territoire de la future Civitas Tungrorum ' RBN 142 (1996), pp. 5-51. 40 None of these peoples is listed by Caesar as Belgie (possibly because all three were marginal to the events of 57 bc), although they were included in the Augustan province. For a new study of the coinages attributed to the Treveri, see Loscheider, 'Münzwesen des Trevererlandes'. 41 N. Roymans, and W. Van der Sanden, 'Celtic coins from the Netherlands and their archaeological context', Berichten van de Rijksdienst voor het Oudheidkundig Bodemonderzoek 30 (1980), pp. 173-254, although the attribution is open to doubt; cf. Scheers, 'Frappe et circulation', p. 29.</page><page sequence="11">IRON AGE COINAGE 121 by Philip II of Macedón and his successors in Greece and the Near East from C.340 BC onward, even faithfully reproducing specific symbols used by the individual mints.42 Seven main groups of primary copies can be identified, widely dispersed over an area extending from south-west Germany through northern Switzerland and eastern and central France and as far as the Atlantic coast. These first-generation imitations generally weigh over 8-1 g, only a little less than the Greek originals (c.8-6 g), and were probably fairly long-lived.43 Although examples of both the Greek prototypes and their primary copies have occasionally been found in Belgie Gaul,44 there was nothing until relatively recently to suggest that any of these first-generation Philippus imitations were actually minted in the region. Weiller has, however, drawn attention to a group of heavy staters found in or near the Moselle valley, which he suggests are local to the region.45 The coins in question are copied from the staters minted for Philip III at Lampsacus between c.323-315 bc. Their claim to be local is strengthened by the existence of a group of related half-staters, known as the series 'à la fleur' (Scheers 6), found in the areas bordering the river Meuse, where the Eastern and Central zones meet. What both the engraving style and the weight (equivalent to a stater of over 8-2 g) indicate are the earliest coins (Class I), have a number of features indicating that the half-staters are copied from the Moselle valley staters. The crucial link is provided by the presence of a globule under the horses, identical to that found on the staters.46 This feature, derived from the human head used as a mint mark on the Lampsacus coins later developed into the flower shaped ornament which gives the coinage its name. Altogether, Scheers has recognised six stages of typological degradation, suggesting that the series was struck over a considerable period of time. Also likely to belong to a relatively early stage of coinage in the Eastern zone are two series of heavy quarter-staters; the first of these, with a rosette under the single horse 42 S.

Staters imitating coins from the Pella mint are recorded from Boppard (Germany), and Soy (Belgium) respectively. A Philippus stater minted at Lampsacus was found at Milton, Kent. 45 R. Weiller, 'Zum Beginn des Münzumlaufs im Gebiet der Treverer', Trierer Zeitschrift 49 (1986), pp. 209-21.

Another lighter and more devolved stater belonging to the same series was found at Roedgen (Luxembourg). 46 cf. Scheers, 'Frappe et circulation', fig. 9, 2-3; the second horse is represented only by its head and rear legs.</page><page sequence="12">122 COLIN HASELGROVE (Scheers 7), is assumed to belong to the same general area as the half-staters, although no provenances are recorded; while the second series, where the horse has acquired wings (Scheers 36), has a distribution suggesting an origin between the Meuse and the Rhine.47 The earliest coinage in the Western zone consists of a group of similarly heavy gold half- and quarter-stater types found in the Somme area of Picardy, in the heart of the region which Caesar later called Belgium (Scheers 1-5).48 Such coins also occur occasionally in south-east England, all but two of the known finds coming from east Kent.49 As with the half-staters ' à la fleur', the multiplicity of different types suggests a series of some duration, as well as the possibility of minting by more than one polity. Unusually, this series was partly inspired by the coinage of Tarentum in southern Italy. The presumed earliest half-stater type (Scheers 1-1) is directly copied from a Tarentine coin dating between c.334-302bc, while later varieties possess traits which probably derive from other Tarentine issues dating to the late fourth or early third centuries bc (e.g. Scheers 2-1; Pl. 17, l).50 From an early point in the series, however, the simulated legends (and arguably the two-horse chariot) on the reverse of many of the types bear witness to the probable influence of first- generation Philippus copies, showing that the Picardy coinage is secondary to the earliest imitations of the Macedonian stater. In the absence of direct evidence, the exact dating of Stage 1 remains uncertain, but three main factors suggest that it is broadly equivalent to La Tène Cl, although the primary Philippus copies found in the Moselle valley may be yet earlier.51 First, the hoard evidence from southern Italy and Sicily implies that relatively little Macedonian gold ever travelled to the West, and those coins which did, had disappeared from circulation before the second 47 The winged horse on Scheers 36 bears little resemblance to the Pegasus depicted on the coinage of Corinth or Syracuse. If a Greek model other than the Philippus is involved, a possible source is the fifth century bc Syracusan silver on which Nike is shown flying above the horses, crowning them, or, less likely, the gold staters of Hiketas (287-278 bc) and other third century types showing Nike driving the chariot. For other potential copying of Syracusan issues, see D. Nash, 'Syracusan influence upon the earliest gold coinage of western Gaul', Mélanges Colbert de Beaulieu , pp. 657-83. 48 From their weight (c.2-8 g), the Scheers 5 coins were probably intended as third-staters. 49 Seven of these half- and quarter-staters have been found in Britain, demonstrating the close ties which existed between Kent and the Somme region even at this early date. One of these coins (a Scheers 2 half-stater) comes from Milton, where a Lampsacus Philippus is also recorded (n. 44 above). Two other coins were part of a hoard of mainly first century AD coins found at Waltham St Lawrence, Berkshire; A. Burnett, 'Celtic coinage in Britain III', BN J 60 (1990), p. 21. 50 Scheers, Traité , pp. 27-32; idem, 'The origins and evolution of coinage in Belgie Gaul', in B. W. Cunliffe (ed.), Coinage and Society in Britain and Gaul , CBA Res. Rep. 38 (London, 1981), pp. 18-23. 51 Also probably of Stage 1, but not certainly from Belgie Gaul, is a rare stater whose obverse type directly copies the head of Parthenope on didrachms struck at Naples between c. 300-240 bc; the reverse is a normal Philippus type; see Scheers op. cit. in n. 50, p. 18 and fig. 6, nos. 15-16. Examples of this type are recorded from near Nancy, in the Eastern zone.</page><page sequence="13">IRON AGE COINAGE 123 quarter of the third century bc.52 Assuming that the western Greek cities were the source of most of the Philippi imitated in Gaul - a view supported by the occasional use of other south Italian and Sicilian prototypes - the coins in question are unlikely to have travelled north much after the early third century bc. The Tarentine gold types imitated in Picardy also seem not to have circulated for very long or in very large quantities.53 Although by no means decisive, this does nothing to weaken the view that Gaulish imitations began at a date fairly close to the prototypes. Second, two imitations of the Alexander III Nike stater found in a tumulus burial at Dobian in Germany, if reliable, demonstrate that copying of Macedonian gold was underway in central Europe by the La Tène B2-C1 transition at latest (i.e. c.275 bc).54 Third, but not least, an implicit terminus ante quem for Stage 1 is provided by a series of archaeological finds which show that evolved Philippus coinages were already widespread in Europe by the end of La Tène Cl or very early in La Tène C2. Although typological developments undoubtedly did not occur at a uniform rate over the whole of Europe, it is notable that the relevant Philippus finds are all lighter and further removed from their Greek prototypes than the earliest Belgie types. They include two quarter-staters of the Swiss Unterentfelden series from La Tène C2 burials at Horgen and Langdorf,55 while a quarter-stater of related type, bearing a double-sun symbol, was found in a third La Tène C2 burial at Trier-Euren.56 Another quarter-stater of the same type, and one bearing a triskeles mark, were found adhering to a La Tène C2 sword scabbard which formed part of the offerings deposited at the eponymous site of La Tène.57 Further to the south, a quarter-stater belonging to the second-generation of central Gaulish copies has been found in a ditch dated to the end of La Tène Cl at the settlement 52 A. Burnett and J. Williams, 'Alexander the Great and the coinages of western Greece', in R. Ashton and S. Hurter (eds), Studies in Greek Numismatics in Memory of Martin Jessop Price (London, 1998), pp. 381-3. Ibid., p. 391. As Jonathan Williams has pointed out to me, this apparent scarcity of Macedonian gold in the western Mediterranean, as well as in Gaul itself, makes the imitation of Tarentine types easier to comprehend. 54 H. Polenz, 'Münzen in Gräbern', pp. 57-8. This find is not particularly well recorded by modern standards and the integrity of the group is open to some degree of doubt. 55 H. Polenz, 'Münzen in Gräbern', pp. 69-72 (Horgen) and 74-5 (Langdorf). The Horgen burial, in particular, shows features consistent with the La Tène C1-C2 transition, suggesting a date close to 200 bc. 56 Ibid., p. 86. On metrological grounds, Allen suggested that the Unterentfelden quarters were secondary to the earliest Swiss second-generation copies, while the double-sun coins were slightly later still; see D. F. Allen, 'The Philippus in Switzerland and the Rhinelanď, SNR 53 (1974), pp. 47-8. 57 J. M. de Navarro, The Finds from the Site of La Tène . Vol. I: Scabbards and the Swords Found in Them , pp. 430-1. The quarter-staters may simply have been thrown into the water separately and come to rest on the scabbard. Coins do however sometimes seem to have been among the objects mounted for display at Iron Age cult sites, as at Harlow temple (Essex), so we should not rule out the possibility of their having been deliberately attached.</page><page sequence="14">124 COLIN HASELGROVE of Aulnat, La Grande Borne.58 Finally, there is the Gaulish stater identified as a Class 3 Tayac type recorded from another Iron Age burial at Hostomice, in the Czech Republic, some 1200 km away from its normal area of circulation. Although this find has to be treated with some caution, a date within La Tène Cl is entirely plausible.59 Delestrée has recently countered with the argument that the earliest Picardy coins must be later because otherwise stratified examples would have turned up in the many Picardy sanctuary excavations, which I would challenge.60 In the earliest phases of coin use, gold was probably only deposited in exceptional circumstances, and then generally away from sites of any kind. The relatively common broad-flan coins (Scheers 8), which succeeded the earliest Picardy types, are themselves represented by a mere two finds from the main Picardy sanctuaries.61 Far more significant in my view, is the recent discovery at Ribemont-sur-Ancre (Somme) of two half- staters belonging to a group with an anthropomorphic sword depicted on the reverse, in a context which may well date to La Tène Cl.62 This 'sword' 58 Guichard, Pion et al., 'Circulation monétaire', p. 34. The coin belongs to a defaced series which Nash regards as directly descended from the earliest Philippus copies in the region; see D. Nash, Settlement and Coinage in Central Gaul c. 200-50 bc, BAR S-39 (Oxford, 1978), pp. 87-90. For the burial, see Polenz, 'Münzen in Gräbern', pp. 73-5, who proposes an early La Tene Cl date, and V. Kruta, 'Archéologie et Numismatique; la phase initiale du monnayage Celtique', Études Celtiques 1982, pp. 73-8, who suggests a still earlier date. As Kruta notes, however, one of the two types of bronze armring found in the burial can occur in later graves, making a date up the end of La Tène Cl possible. The finds were not recorded at the time, but were offered for sale by a jeweller a decade later. While the description of the grave sounds authentic, the integrity of the group cannot be taken for granted. For the identification of the coin, see R. Boudet, 'A propos du dépôt d'or celtique de Tayac (Gironde)', Mélanges Colbert de Beaulieu , p. 109, Class III, and Fig. 3, 16. Delestrée, Monnayages , p. 116. Two Scheers 1 quarter-staters were in fact found at Ribemont-sur-Ancre in early Roman contexts (ibid., pp. 83-6), while a Scheers 5 half-stater was excavated at Epiais-Rhus with material dating between the third century bc and the early first century ad; J.-M. Lardy et al., 'Monnaies celtiques en situation de fouille sur le site d'Epiais- Rhus (Val d'Oise)', in Brunaux and Gruel, Monnaies en fouilles , pp. 152-210. As I have noted, later disturbances and the probable use of old coins as offerings pose particular problems at these sanctuary sites. The only Scheers 1-5 coins with an archaeological context from Britain were part of the later hoard from Waltham St. Lawrence, also a religious site (n. 49 above). 61 Ibid., pp. 48-9 (Vendeuil-Caply), and p. 77 (Fesques). Neither is from a useful context. 62 J.-L. Brunaux and L.-P. Delestrée, ' Un hémistatère trouvé en situ dans le sanctuaire de Ribemont-sur-Ancre (Somme)', Cah. Num. 32 (1995), pp. 9-12. The half-stater which gave rise to their article was found in a layer containing human bone and mid-La Tène Cl weaponry. These are interpreted as the fallen remains of trophies displayed in Phase 1 of the sanctuary. From the next phase of cult activity, which dates to La Tène C2, it is inferred that this happened at the end of the third century bc. In their conviction that the coin must be later than the deposit in which it was found, the authors concluded that the deposit had been disturbed; the grounds for this appear to be that the coin was found where the (missing) hand of a human arm lying next to it should have been. A few clearly intrusive items (amphora fragments and a La Tène Dib brooch) were recovered in the same deposits, leading them to suggest that the coin was deposited at the same time. The second half-stater, which comes from earlier excavations, was found around 10 m away from the first. Although less well documented, it apparently came from the same horizon of deposits. To sustain the case for a later date, this coin too would have to be intrusive, a point which the article does not address. Without clear-cut evidence of</page><page sequence="15">IRON AGE COINAGE 125 group has its home in Normandy west of the Seine, where it seems to represent a stage of development slightly later than the earliest Belgie half- stater series.63 If reliable, the presence of such coins in a late third century bc context at Ribemont not only confirms de Jersey's dating for the series, but must push the origin of coinage in northern Gaul back towards the start of the century. On balance then, a starting date in La Tène Cl - or even in the latter part of La Tène B2 - seems very probable for the very earliest Belgie coinages. Equally, although the coinages were probably of some duration, to judge from the number of typological varieties which exist, there is no compelling reason to suggest that they outlasted the end of La Tène Cl. From the rarity of die links noted by Scheers among the surviving specimens, many Stage 1 coinages were probably also originally more abundant than appears the case today. Stage 2 (c. 200-125 bc) The main developments during Stage 2 were the striking of gold coinage over a much larger area than previously and the introduction of cast potin coinage in the Southern and Eastern zones. The gold staters belonging to this stage weigh between 8 0 and 7 0 g and generally have much broader flans (c.23-27 mm) than the earlier Philippus imitations; they also survive in far greater numbers than any of the Stage 1 series. In archaeological terms, this phase coincides with La Tène C2 and La Tène Dia. Within this period, coins start to occur on settlements, while gold was now occasionally hoarded, allowing different series to be related to one another. In Picardy, the earliest gold coinage was in due course succeeded by one consisting of broad-flan staters and divisions (Scheers 8, known in Britain as Gallo-Belgic A; Pl. 17, 2). This has a markedly wider and denser distribution on both sides of the Channel than its predecessor. The complexity of the series suggests a long-lived coinage, but precise dating is elusive. Both typology and fineness suggest that the staters with the head and horse facing right (Classes I-V, averaging 76-77% gold) partly predate the left-facing varieties (Classes VI-VIII, which average only 71-73 % gold).64 This point is supported by the apparent association of coins belonging to the later right- facing types with a smaller number of left-facing coins in the important disturbance, I see no reason to doubt the association of both coins with the La Tène Cl metalwork with which they were found. The final publication is awaited with interest. 63 The Normandy sword types have recently been discussed by P. de Jersey, Coinage in Iron Age Armorica , OUCA Monograph 39 (1994), pp. 42-7. One of the Ribemont coins is an example of de Jersey's double sword type (so named because the charioteer holds a second sword), while the other is a new variant, on which the charioteer holds a tore. Many of the sword coins weigh the equivalent of a stater of over 8 g, although others - including the two Ribemont coins - are lighter and some are heavily debased. Typologically, they belong to a generation of Philippus derivatives which are further removed from the prototypes than the earliest Belgie coinages. 64 Haselgrove, 'Development', pp. 35-6.</page><page sequence="16">126 COLIN HASELGROVE votive hoard found at Tayac (Gironde) in 1893.65 Just under half the coins in this find were local issues (the so-called Tayac type), the rest coming from further afield; apart from the Gallo-Belgic coins, the contents included Beaune-type staters from central or eastern Gaul, and plain staters, whose affinities may lie still further east. There was also a twisted gold tore broken into three pieces and divided between the two pots which contained the coins. From their weight, all four stater types seem likely to be broadly contemporary, while various factors suggest that the hoard as a whole is much earlier than the late second or first century bc date which it has hitherto been accorded, largely on unsupported historical grounds. Firstly, as mentioned above, a Class 3 Tayac type stater was apparently present in the Hostomice burial, which if reliable suggests that this series originated in the third century bc, although it could have continued into the second century bc. Secondly, the Beaune staters from the Tayac hoard are likely to be of similar or only slightly later date, since the so-called Chenôves type - which is directly derived from the Beaune type - was itself in existence by the mid second century bc.66 Thirdly, although gold tores are in general no easier to date than coins, the twisted tore found at Tayac closely resembles the example depicted on the sculpture known as 'the dying Gaul'.67 This sculpture originally formed part of the monument erected by Attālus I at Pergamon after 228 bc to celebrate his victory over the Celts of Asia Minor and should be a reliable representation of their material culture at this period. A date for the Tayac tore contemporary with the Tayac and Beaune stater types is therefore entirely plausible. In effect, such independent dating 65 The exact composition of the Tayac hoard is uncertain; according to the earliest mentions, it contained 398 coins. Forrer, who acquired part of it, estimated that about one-sixth of these were Gallo-Belgic issues, but only 7 can now be definitely traced; 6 right-facing staters (3 Cl. IV ; 3 Cl. V) and 1 left-facing (Cl. VI); H.- J. Kellner, 'Der Fund von Tayac, ein Zeugnis des Cimbernzuges?', JNG 20 (1970), pp. 20-47. The former Coppens collection (which contained other ex-Tayac coins) included 4 right-facing (2 Cl. IV, 2 Cl. V) and 2 left-facing (Cl. VII) staters, which might be from the hoard; while Forrer lists a further 11 coins, all right-facing types (for this reason, I am inclined to reject Castelin's attribution to the hoard of a left-facing ex-Forrer coin (Scheers 8-VIII) now in Zurich Museum). In sum, if the known hoard coins are a reliable guide, right-facing staters greatly outnumbered left-facing types, while Classes IV, V, VI and perhaps VII were all represented. 66 Nash, Settlement and Coinage , pp. 67-73 ; a Chenôves stater was found in a pit belonging to the earliest occupation at Feurs. The coin came from the lower fill of the pit, which belongs to Phase 1 (dated c. 160-140 bc). Even if the coin were intrusive from the upper fill of the pit, Phase 2 dates no later than c. 130-120 bc; see M. Vaginay and V. Guichard, L'habitat gaulois de Feurs , Documents d'Archéologie Française 14 (Paris, 1988), p. 189. Beaune staters formed about one-sixth of the coins in the Tayac hoard. 67 R. Boudet, L'Age du fer récent dans la partie méridionale de ť Estuaire Girondin (Périgueux, 1987), p. 158. The marble statue which survives in the Capitoline Museum is now thought to be part of the original victory monument rather than being a later, Roman copy, as was long supposed; see M. Mattei, 'The Dying Gaul', in V. Kruta, O.-H. Frey, B. Raftery, M. Szabo (eds), The Celts (London, 1991), pp. 70-1. The balustrade frieze of the sanctuary of Athena at Pergamon (which dates to the early second century bc) depicts several middle La Tène style shield bosses and an ' Italo-Celtic ' helmet.</page><page sequence="17">IRON AGE COINAGE 127 evidence as exists, points to the later third or earlier second century bc, while there is nothing at all to suggest that the undated coin types in the hoard are any later than the others.68 In the circumstances, it would clearly be perverse to date the Tayac hoard after the mid second century bc, while an earlier date is not improbable. In turn, since the earliest varieties of Scheers 8 (Classes I- II) seem to have been absent from the hoard, a date nearer to the La Tène C1-C2 transition is likely for the inception of the series. In this context, we might note that the Swiss Unterentfelden series, which certainly existed early in La Tène C2, is on a similar weight standard to the earliest broad flan coins; a comparable date for Scheers 8 would reinforce the case which has already been made for dating Stage 1 entirely within the third century bc. On the other hand, the existence of other later broad flan varieties, including Class VIII and quite possibly the right-facing Class III, not represented in the Tayac hoard, implies that the series continued into the second half of Stage 2. A terminus ante quem of sorts is provided by the smaller, biface stater (Scheers 9, Gallo- Belgic C), which eventually replaced the broad-flan type as the principal gold coinage of western Belgie Gaul. Although the production of the biface series belongs mainly to Stage 3, the initial change in type may well have taken place in Stage 2; the earliest biface staters (Scheers 9-1) weigh the same as the latest broad-flan coins (c. 7*2-7-3 g), and closely resemble them in type.69 Other Stage 2 coinages in western Belgie Gaul include the staters and quarter-staters 'aux lignes entremêlées', with their defaced obverse dies 68 The plain staters from Tayac are without direct parallel. The 73 examples in the hoard were mostly melted down and only 3 can now be traced (Kellner, 'Tayac', nos. 5-7). One more is in Munich museum; idem. Die Münzfunde von Manching und die keltischen Fundmünzen aus Südbayern , Die Ausgrabungen in Manching 12 (Stuttgart, 1990), no. 2255. The coins, which have slight markings on the obverse and a hollow area occupying half the reverse, bear some resemblance to a group in the St-Louis hoard from Switzerland; see A. Furger-Gunti, 'Der "Goldfund von St-Louis" bei Basel und ähnliche keltische Schatzfunde', Zeitschrift für Schweiz. Archäologie und Kunstgeschichte 39 (1982), pp. 12-18, nos 66-71, while in general terms there are affinities with the plain 'rainbow' and Mussels stater traditions of southern Germany and Bohemia. As yet, there are no analyses of the Tayac series, to indicate whether they share the very pure composition of the St-Louis and Mussels staters, or are alloyed like the German series. The St-Louis hoard contained other types which are most likely to date to La Tène Dl, but the Tayac coins are noticeably heavier than the St. Louis series (c.7-6 g against c.7-3 g), while the 1972 Manching purse find shows that plain 'rainbow' types were in circulation in the earlier second century bc; Kellner, Manching , nos 56-61. There is therefore no reason to suppose the Tayac group to be any later in date. 4 or 5 other staters from Tayac, described as ready for striking, could conceivably have been plain 'rainbow' staters. The only other types recorded from the hoard are an Armorican stater and an early Philippus copy (Kellner, Tayac , nos. 409, 412), although doubt has been expressed over the provenance of the Armorican coin; Boudet, V Age du Fer , p. 154. Whether or not this stater came from Tayac in fact makes little difference to the date, since it belongs to the second stage of Armorican coinage, which ought to be broadly contemporary with Scheers 8; de Jersey, Coinage in Armorica , pp. 64-7, his Type 4. It ought perhaps to be noted that the only left-facing Scheers 8 coin accepted by Kellner (n. 65 above) as certainly from the Tayac hoard was acquired from the same source as the Armorican coin. 69 There are grounds for believing that Scheers 8 continued to circulate in south-east England for some while after it was replaced in Picardy; cf. Delestrée, Monnayages , p. 117.</page><page sequence="18">128 COLIN HASELGROVE (Scheers 10; Gallo-Belgic B), and the series 'au croissant' (Scheers 1 1). Some Scheers 10 coins were apparently struck from obverse dies originally cut for broad flan coins and then altered (Pl. 17, 3).70 Like Scheers 8, they are widespread in south-east England and some varieties are probably of insular manufacture.71 Two staters 'au croissant' were associated with a Scheers 8- II stater in a small hoard found at Hägen (Luxembourg), while the Beringen (Belgium) hoard apparently included three coins of this type, together with 22 plain 'rainbow' staters dating to the mid second century bc, and two gold tores.72 Eastern Belgie Gaul has several gold coinages which either belong in their entirety to Stage 2, or at least originated during this period, although independent dating evidence is scarce. Potentially among the earliest of these coinages is the quarter-stater type with a winged Pegasus on the reverse (Scheers 23), which occurs frequently on both banks of the middle Rhine (Pl. 17, 4). The series is struck in good quality alloy (averaging 79 % gold) at a similar weight to the Unterentfelden series, and the locks of hair hanging behind the head on the Pegasus coins are closely comparable to the locks on the Swiss quarter-staters. There may also be some influence from the earlier Pegasus type (Scheers 36) from further south.73 The absence of significant typological development suggests that, although extensive, this coinage was not particularly long-lived.74 The other Eastern gold coinages mostly consisted of staters and divisions, often struck on thin, broad flans reminiscent of Scheers 8. The three commonest series are one with a janiform head on the obverse and a devolved Philippus style horse on the reverse (Scheers 34) ;75 a second series characterised by a backward-looking horse on the reverse (Scheers 32-33); and lastly a group of inter-related types, some of which depict a human- headed horse of the kind more usually found in Armorican Gaul (Scheers 16-20). The first two groups have overlapping distributions in the southern part of the zone, between the upper reaches of the Marne and the Moselle, the janiform type being the more easterly of the two, whereas the third group is focused north of the German border, along the Saar and the lower Moselle. 70 A.

It is hoped that the die studies now in progress by John Sills will help resolve these issues. 72 Scheers Hoard 39 (Hägen); and L. Van Impe, G. Creemers, S.

Some of the quarter-staters in this series retain a Philippus style head on the obverse (Scheers 34-1 V). The weight implies that they are broadly contemporary with the earliest janiform issues (Scheers 34-1).</page><page sequence="19">IRON AGE COINAGE 129 A number of rarer varieties also occur, such as the Haltine type (Scheers 21) from the Luxembourg area to the north-west of Scheers 16-20, and a stater with a large bird above the horse, which is similar in style to the janiform coins and comes from the same region (Scheers 35). The beardless janiform head on the obverse of Scheers 34 (Pl. 17, 5) is probably derived from Roman gold or silver issues minted between c.225-212 BC.76 We know that the Roman coins were copied in transalpine Europe soon after they began to be minted, since a similar janiform head occurs on a series of minute gold coins with a galloping horse on the reverse, found in Switzerland and southern Germany. Two examples of this latter type have been found in La Tène Cl burials at Biel and Giengen,77 while a third example comes from a context belonging to the early phase of occupation at the Bavarian oppidum of Manching (i.e. La Tène C1-C2).78 These tiny coins were probably intended as 1 /24 of a stater and appear very slightly to precede the earliest 'rainbow' staters in southern Germany. Whatever their precise starting date, the Belgie janiform coins were evidently minted over a period of some duration, shown both by the deterioration in style and the progressive reduction in weight from c. 7*5 g to just under 7-0 g, and the latest staters carry what appears to be the Greek legend ©IOAE above the horse (Scheers 34-IIIc). The janiform coinage must have overlapped with the backward-looking horse type (PL 17, 6) in date as well as geographically, the principal difference being that - with the exception of the earliest issues (Scheers 32-1), which were struck to a reasonably high weight of c. 7*65 g - all of the Scheers 32-33 coins were minted at the lower standard (just under 7-0 g), as well as being in very base metal, or even occasionally bronze.79 The derivation of the principal Stage 2 coinages from the Trier area has been discussed by Allen.80 As noted above, the human-headed horse depicted on three of the series (Scheers 16-18) is a feature more usually associated with north-west Gaul, while other elements of the designs, especially on the obverse, have clear stylistic affinities with early Swiss series like the Unterentfelden type and other eastern Gaulish types.

The quarter-staters with a star (Scheers 19) seem to be the earliest variety; they are the heaviest of the five series, equivalent to a stater of c.7-6 g, and display the closest affinities to the early Swiss coins. They were apparently followed by the winged-manikin type (Scheers 16), on which the human- headed horse first appeared (PL 17, 7). This type had a longer currency than the others; it began with coins of good style and fineness, averaging c.7-4 g, but the later staters are of coarser style and were struck from very debased alloy (or occasionally plated).81 Initially, these later issues were evidently intended to weigh c.7-2-6-8 g, but as many as a third of the surviving coins weigh no more than 4-8-5-8 g. Various features of the otherwise similar lyre type (Scheers 18) show that it is secondary to the winged-manikin series; it, too, was struck in poor quality alloy (c.50-70% silver), although the weight was more tightly controlled and is only just less than the early Scheers 16 coins (the average is c.7-3 g). A quarter-stater with a horned head (Scheers 17) possibly belongs with the later winged-manikin staters, while a stater with a normal horse on the reverse, driven by a winged charioteer (Scheers 20), completes the group. Given the marked differences in weight and fineness between coins belonging to the same series, we should be cautious in applying chronological rules derived from other parts of Gaul to any of these eastern Belgie coinages. Understandably, the poor weight and alloy of the latest coins has usually led to their being dated close to the Roman conquest, an impression perhaps reinforced by the Greek legend on the latest janiform staters (Scheers 34- IIIc).82 That this may not be the case is apparent from the discovery of a bronze stater of the devolved Morville type (Scheers 37) in an early La Tène Dib burial at Wederath (Germany), providing a late second century bc terminus ante quern for the series.83 There is no reason to suppose that Scheers 37, which occurs on the eastern fringes of the same general area, is any earlier 81 For metal analyses, see Loscheider, 'Münzwesen des Treverer landes', p. 202. Three of the four quarter-staters analysed have an average gold content of 71%; the fourth is heavily debased (c.35%). All four staters examined were effectively silver coins, with an average gold content of only 19 %. It is possible that the winged-manikin type originated outside Belgie Gaul and was copied there. As Allen notes, the design apparently influenced a quite separate series, traditionally attributed to the Aulerci Cenomani, in western Normandy; see de Jersey, Coinage in Armorica , pp. 59-63. The findspots for winged-manikin staters in good style offer little help, examples coming from Wyl (Switzerland), Nijmegen (Netherlands) and Jersey. 82 Another 'inscribed' type which might belong to the Eastern zone is Scheers 22. The stater bears the retrograde legend EX0EX beneath the horse and is struck in good gold (c.83 %), on a weight standard analogous to many of the Eastern series discussed here (equivalent to a stater of c. 7-2-7-4 g). Only 2 findspots are known, one at Trier, the other in Baden-Württemburg. The presence of the Latin legend EIQITIAICO on an early Philippus type (e.g. Fischer, 'Premières imitations', pp. 149-52), cautions against reading too much into the isolated occurrence of early legends on other Gaulish series. 83 Polenz, 'Münzen in Gräbern', pp. 91-3.</page><page sequence="21">IRON AGE COINAGE 131 than the later classes of Scheers 32-34, and it could well be later.84 It therefore seems likely that, in common with much of eastern and central France, the minting of gold coinage had all but ceased in this part of the Eastern zone by the end of Stage 2, its place being taken by silver and potin (Stage 3, below).85 Further north, a terminus ante quem for the 'Armorican style' series is provided by the minting of new gold types (Scheers 30-IV) in the Trier area during La Tène D2a, although here too, the earlier series may well have ceased at an earlier date.86 If we accept that weight and purity of alloy do not have the same significance for dating in eastern Belgie Gaul as, for example, in Picardy,87 the style of the Eastern Stage 2 coinages argues for a starting date not far removed from that of the Western broad-flan series (Scheers 8, 1 1).88 Among the different types, the Pegasus quarter-staters (Scheers 23) stand out as probably the earliest; in the absence of discernible typological development, a date wholly within La Tène C2 is entirely plausible. On the other hand, by analogy with the broad-flan coinage attributed to the Parisii, which is derived from Scheers 8 via the so-called Sarcelles types,89 some or all of the Eastern broad-flan coinages could well have begun a little later than those in the 84 Most of the known specimens are bronze, with a weight between 6*1-6-6 g. The affinities of the type appear to lie with other eastern Gaulish gold coinages from outside the region; Allen, 'The Philippus', p. 56. The supposed 'hoard' of 7 Scheers 32-33 staters found with potm and bronze coins and 38 bronze 'rouelles' (wheels) at Boviolles in 1867 (Scheers Hoard 16) has the look of mixed temple offerings. While the potins (7 Scheers 186, 2 Scheers 195, 1 LT 8329) date to Stage 3, or even in some cases to Stage 2, the inscribed bronze (Scheers 137) is a Stage 4 type. An unidentified bronze and a small electrum coin (Scheers 152?) were also found. 86 Wigg has drawn attention to the discovery of a Scheers 18 quarter-stater with two early Stage 3 silver types (Scheers 54, 56) at Groß-Gerau; see Wigg and Riederer, 'Chronologie', p. 668. Assuming the implied association is valid (the coins were found individually, within 100 m of each other), this could reflect contemporary minting or merely continued circulation. 87 The analysis of the 'Baiocasses' staters in the Ringwood (Hampshire) hoard implies that in some contexts, the alloy was relatively unimportant; see B. W. Cunliffe and P. de Jersey, Armorica and Britain , Studies in Celtic Coinage 3 (Oxford, 1997), pp. 75-6. As de Jersey notes, despite coming from a single pair of dies, the 'lyre' type coins in the hoard had a gold content varying from 25-6 % to 34-4 % and equally variable silver and copper contents, suggesting that several batches of alloy were used. On the other hand, the 'boar' type coins from the same find, which from relative wear appear to be the later type, had a markedly finer and more consistent composition (all but one falling between 36-7 and 40*6 % gold). In this respect, it may not be coincidence that the so-called Armorican style types show the greatest variations in composition of any of the Eastern Stage 2 series. 88 Setting aside silver and plated coins, the latest Eastern issues appear to conform to standards within 5 % of the average weight (7-2 g) of the lightest Gallo-Belgic A staters (CI. VIII). 89 S. Scheers, 'Le trésor de Sarcelles', RBN 124 (1978), pp. 53-6. The 'Parisii' gold coinage is currently being studied by John Sills, who regards the two Sarcelles hoard types as standing at the head of the series (John Sills pers. comm.). At c.1-6 g, the Sarcelles staters and divisions are slightly lighter than the earliest Scheers 8 coins, on much the same standard as the Eastern series. In its later stages, the 'Parisii' series underwent a debasement comparable to the Eastern types and the latest types are on a similar weight standard; see J.-B. Colbert de Beaulieu, Les monnaies des Parisii (Paris, 1970).</page><page sequence="22">132 COLIN HASELGROVE Western zone; for them, a date in the later part of La Tène C2, continuing through most or all of La Tène Dia, is perhaps more likely. The only gold apparently in circulation in the Southern zone during Stage 2 was the so-called 4 globule-à-la-croix ' series (Scheers 15; PL 17, 8). This series has a dispersed distribution and its territory of origin may be slightly to the south of Belgie Gaul. Excavated finds are known from Damary (Aisne) in a possible La Tène Dia context;90 from Acy-Romance in a La Tène DIB pit;91 and at St-Denis-les-Sens (Yonne), where a pot containing 242 globules- à-la croix was found buried in the post-hole of a building dating to the La Tène Dlb/D2a transition.92 Detailed examination of the St-Denis coins has shown that Scheers 15 can be sub-divided morphologically into three classes, each of different purity: flat (78% gold); hemispherical (72% gold); and spherical (72-67% gold).93 For what it is worth, the weight and fineness of the first two classes is similar to Scheers 8 and the first biface types (Scheers 9-1); whereas the spherical coins, although of better weight, employ alloys more comparable to later biface coins (Classes III-V). The fact that the coin from the earliest excavated context, at Damary, belongs to the middle class of Scheers 15, implies that the series originated well before 120 bc. How long it lasted is more open to doubt, a possible terminus ante quem being provided by the minting of the Southern 'eye' staters (Scheers 30-1) in the same region before the end of La Tène Dib (see below).94 The major monetary development in southern Belgie Gaul during Stage 2 was the adoption of potin coinage ultimately derived from Massaliote struck bronze issues of late third or early second century bc date. For a long time the dating of potin was controversial,95 but the archaeological evidence from sites like Acy-Romance, Damary and Bisseul (Marne) leaves very little doubt that potins were widespread in northern Champagne by La Tène Dia.96 Pion 90 Excavations by the author. 91 B.

The majority of specimens recorded by Scheers fall in the range 7-15-7-45 g. 94 The series has often been dated relatively late due to the association of 200 globules-à-la- croix with 200 uniface staters (Scheers 24-1) in the hoard found between Châlons and Reims in 1905 (Scheers Hoard 68). Dhénin and Fischer, op. cit in n. 93, mention a second hoard of uniface staters and globules-à-la-croix found recently in Côte-d'Or. Another hoard from Puteaux contained one Scheers 15 coin and 120 'Parisii' Class V staters (Scheers Hoard 67); the Class V coins belong to the later stages of the Parisii series, placing them in the later part of Stage 2 or early in Stage 3.

The pattern of discoveries from the excavated sites mentioned above and from slightly later settlements such as Reims, rue d'Anjou (Marne); La Cheppe, Camp de Mourmelon (Marne); and Condé-sur-Suippe,99 implies that LT 7388-7405 and Scheers 203 were the earliest types, making their debut during La Tène C2, whereas the boar-standard and torc-bearer types have yet to be found in contexts predating La Tène Dia.100 Both Scheers 186 and 191 circulated in enormous quantities in southern and eastern Belgie Gaul - where they were evidently the principal potin types in use during the last quarter of the second century bc - as well as further afield. To the extent that a core area of circulation can be recognised for either coin type, the boar-standard series is particularly abundant in southern Champagne and Lorraine, taking in the southern part of the Eastern zone as defined above, while the torc-bearer type has a complementary distribution, covering virtually the entire Southern zone. Scheers 191 coins also occur in far from negligible quantities at many of the important sanctuaries in the Western zone, which had virtually no potin types of its own.101 Scheers 186 and 191 were widely used outside their primary area of circulation, often being copied locally by the technique known as surmoulage , whereby coins were themselves used to make new casting moulds.

Lambot's analysis is confined to Acy-Romance, whereas Pion's periodisation is based on a seriation of assemblages from several sites along the Aisne valley and should therefore be reliable for the region as a whole. 98 Like the globules-à-la-croix (Scheers 15), Lt 7388-7405 has close connections with the southern Paris basin and may well have originated there, raising the possibility that the presence of both types in northern Champagne has a common explanation. 99 For Reims, Delestrée, Monnayages , p. 138; for La Cheppe, Chossenot, Recherches , pp. 53-9; for Condé-sur-Suippe, P.

It is possible that the torc-bearer image was inspired by the running figure on the reverse of Scheers 193; an example of this relatively rare potin type was found in a La Tène C2 context at Acy-Romance; see Pion, 'Caractères généraux' (n. 22 above). As well as settlement finds, Scheers 186 potins have been found in burials at San Bernardo, Ornavasso (Italy), Grave 49, probably of La Tène Dia date; and at Uffhofen (Switzerland), and Wederath (Germany), both La Tène Dib. 101 Delestrée, Monnayages , pp. 32-96.</page><page sequence="24">134 COLIN HASELGROVE of such copying is documented in the low weight and poor quality of many of the tore-bearer coins from St Maur and the other Picardy sanctuaries.102 Scheers 186 exists in numerous variants, many of which probably have geographical and chronological significance.103 The variety most often found in northern Champagne (Scheers 186-Ia) is generally thought to be the earliest type, which might suggest that the series originated in the Southern zone, before being adopted by the eastern Belgie peoples as their principal potin type. Relatively few excavated Iron Age sites have, however, been published in this part of Belgie Gaul and the picture may well alter when more data become available. Another significant early Belgie potin coinage comprises close copies of the Massalia prototype (LT 5284) found in the Vexin region on the borders of upper Normandy. At the Epiais-Rhus sanctuary complex, four examples were apparently found in association with the earliest wheel-thrown pottery produced in the region,104 suggesting a date for their introduction around the mid second century bc. The closely-related potin series found in south-east England is probably equally early.105 Stage 3 (c. 125-60 bc) Archaeologically, this phase runs from the end of La Tène Dia until the start of La Tène D2b. The number and diversity of coin types greatly increased, with all four zones now producing distinctive regional series of their own, necessitating a more selective treatment of the material. During this period coins began to be employed regularly as offerings at important religious sites, as well as becoming markedly more common in settlement deposits. Most Stage 3 gold coinages weighed nearer 6-0 g than 7-0 g, and were struck on smaller flans (c. 16-1 8 mm diameter) than in Stage 2, while the potin types introduced in Stage 3 were generally of far higher quality than their predecessors. By the early first century bc, locally minted potins were in common use everywhere except the Western zone, which produced struck bronze instead. Silver was also minted for the first time in certain areas, but inscriptions were still virtually non-existent until the very end of the period. In western Belgie Gaul, the broad-flan type was replaced by the more abstract biface series (Scheers 9, Gallo-Belgic C). The latter series is 102 L.-P. Delestrée, 4 Les monnaies Gauloises ďEstrées-St-Denis (Oise)', Rev. Archéol. de Picardie 1/2 (1993), p. 51. 103 Scheers defines 19 variants of her type 186.

Haselgrove, 'Potin coinage in Iron Age Britain, archaeology and chronology', Gallia 52 (1995), pp. 1 17-27. Although the Thurrock type is clearly the earliest British potin series, the early dating of the outlined head type (LT 7388) might well support Colbert de Beaulieu's idea that this Gaulish series also had a role in the evolution of the later Kentish flat-linear series, 'Chronologie des bronzes Gaulois', pp. 31-2.</page><page sequence="25">IRON AGE COINAGE 135 characterised by its smaller, thicker flans and while Class I weighs virtually the same as the later broad flan coins (c.7-25 g), the subsequent Classes II-V are appreciably lighter (c.6*3-6-9 g). The initial change in coin type probably belongs to the closing stages of Stage 2, but the earliest archaeological evidence relates to Class III coins (Pl. 17, 13). What seems to be a plated copy of a Class III biface stater is known from an early La Tène D2a cremation burial at Acy-Romance,106 while at Niederzier (Germany), 20 biface staters belonging to a variant of Class III were found in a pot with 26 'rainbow' staters, an armring and 2 gold tores, which had been buried in the interior of a late Iron Age enclosed settlement next to what is interpreted as a possible cult post.107 None of the four 'rainbow' stater types found at Niederzier is likely to be later than La Tène Dl, as demonstrated by the presence of one of the later varieties in a well furnished burial at Nierstein, which Polenz dates to the start of La Tène Dib.108 The occupation of the Niederzier settlement is more difficult to date, but probably spans most of La Tène Dl, and certainly does not continue beyond La Tène D2a.109 Assuming the hoard is contemporary with the site - as seems likely - rather than a later votive offering, the strict terminus ante quem for deposition is c. 60 bc, but an earlier date is likely. Another three Scheers 9 staters of the same variety as Niederzier have been found in the Central zone, which is presumably their home.110 They may be compared to other localised copies of Scheers 9 found in western Belgie Gaul and in south-east England,111 distinct from the cruder regional derivatives (British A-K) to which the biface type also gave rise across the Channel. The other dating evidence for Scheers 9 is essentially indirect, but accords with the Acy-Romance and Niederzier discoveries in suggesting that the biface type was current in the late second century bc. As well as strongly influencing developments in Britain, Scheers 9 served as a general model for 106 M.

Why peoples on both sides of the Channel were so attracted to this one prototype remains a matter for speculation, but may be connected in some way to the prestige of its issuers. As I have argued elsewhere, these secondary Belgie coinages have a complex typological relationship with one another.112 In effect two principal families existed; one comprising types derived directly from the original biface stater; and a second group, for which the 'eye' stater type (Scheers 30-1 ; Pl. 17, 14) is the paramount influence. This latter series was formerly attributed in its entirety to the Treveri, but can now be divided into two separate coinages on distributional grounds: Class I- III 'eye' staters belong to the Southern zone,113 whereas for Classes IV-VI the original attribution to the Eastern zone holds good. Both typology and weight indicate that the Scheers 30-IV staters which head the second 'eye' series are derived from the Scheers 30-1 coins. In addition to the two 'eye' coinages, this second grouping includes the Triquetra series from the north of the Eastern Zone (Scheers 31), which takes its obverse from 'rainbow' staters of the Bochum type and the reverse from the Class IV 'eye' staters; and arguably the series 'à l'astre' (Scheers 25) from the southern part of the Western zone,114 which also appears to be significantly influenced by the 'eye' staters. The typological grouping headed directly by Scheers 9 includes the uniface series which follows on from the biface type in western Belgie Gaul (Scheers 24, Gallo-Belgic E; Pl. 17, 15); the 'epsilon' series of the Central zone (Scheers 29 ; PI. 17, 16), which has a distribution which substantially overlaps that of the uniface staters; and the triple-tailed horse series of the Southern zone (Scheers 26, Gallo-Belgic F ; Pl. 17, 17). The uniface series appears to have given rise to two more subsidiary coinages of the same type in the Artois region, as well as one in Britain.115 The triple-tailed group had an even 112 C. C.

Delestrée and C. Delplace, 'La série trimetallique à l'astre: témoin du monnayage bellovaque', Melanges Colbert de Beaulieu , pp. 253-74. While the authors were right to question the previous attribution of Scheers 25 to the Veliocasses, their alternative (the Bellovaci) is no more satisfactory, as Delestrée concedes ('Monnayages en or', pp. 102-3); the gold in particular is confined to a small area of the Normandy-Picardy border where three later civitates met (the Ambiani are the third), and where the otherwise unknown Pagus Catuslogi is attested (at Bois l'Abbé). This underlines the difficulties of making secure tribal attributions at this date. 115 Classes I-III are a direct continuation of the biface type (as the die links between Scheers 9 and Scheers 24-1 indicate), but Scheers, 'Saint Quentin', pp. 346-9, has now sub-divided her Class IV into four separate groups; the ' Pierregot ' type, with Class V completes the core series; the ' St-Quentin ' type with Class VI forms a second strand; while the 'Lumbres' type with Class VII form a third, both lighter than the mainstream types. The fourth group is, she suggests, of insular origin. These series presumably developed in parallel with one another. E. Huysecom, 'Le dépôt de statères celtiques unifaces - type Scheers 24 -du "Mont d'Or" (Leuze-en- Hainault)', Archaeologia Belgica 3 (1987), pp. 101-16, suggests that Classes II-III form a single</page><page sequence="27">IRON AGE COINAGE 137 greater influence on British developments, and also has significant links with the Class I 'eye' staters, to which I shall return. My previous suggestion that 'British Qa' coins struck in yellow gold to a weight of 5-9 g actually formed part of the French parent series,116 has been strengthened by the recent discovery of two major hoards in northern France, one near Vernon (Eure), the other at Nanteuil-le-Haudouin (Oise), each comprising about one-third Scheers 26 staters and two-thirds 'British QA' I shall follow Delestrée in referring to the latter as the 'anchor' type (PL 17, 18). 117 Recent finds imply that the developments represented by these gold coinages occupied a much longer period of time than Scheers believed when she first set out the relationships between the different series. On current evidence, the Southern 'eye' coinage was probably the earliest of these types, as the typological model which I proposed in 1984 in fact predicted. A Class I stater has been found in a La Tène Dib pit at Condé-sur-Suippe, which implies that Scheers 30-1 was in circulation by the first decade of the first century bc.118 While this might seem early, it is consistent with the dating suggested above for the globule-à-la-croix series (Scheers 15), which precedes the 'eye' staters on sites in the same area. Be that as it may, the Southern 'eye' staters were certainly current well before the end of La Tène D2a. Several Scheers 30-1 coins have been found at the fortified site of St Thomas (Aisne), which was abandoned around the La Tène D2a/D2b transition,119 while silver coins with an obverse which is clearly copied from series, geographically distinct from Scheers 24-1, although the frequent association of Classes I, II and III in the same hoards, not least in Britain, perhaps militates against this view. 116 Haselgrove, Iron Age Coinage , p. 87; Delestrée, Monnayages , p. 42. 117 For the hoards, see Delestrée, 'Monnayages en or', pp. 104-5. The type takes its name from the horizontal anchor which, together with a third lock of hair, replaces the 'eye' on the obverse of Scheers 26-11 and III coins. The reverse type is identical. To all intents and purposes, the anchor coins weigh the same as Class III (5*96 g), although this might alter when the hoard coins are published. As I noted previously ( Iron Age coinage , p. 243), the obverse of the 'anchor' type is closer to Class I or even to Scheers 9. As with the uniface coins, it seems likely that the later stages of the triple-tailed horse series consisted of at least three parallel groups ; Class III being one, the 'anchor' type, the second; and Class IV-V, the third; the latter, which have the horse on the reverse to the right, subsequently gave rise to the inscribed Criciru series (Scheers 27). All four groups were struck at the same weight. 118 The coin was found during excavations by J.-L. Massy in the early 1980s. Patrick Pion (pers. comm.) has examined the other material from this pit and concluded that it is contemporary with the principal occupation; however, without precise details of where the coin was found, it is best to keep an open mind, in case the coin is intrusive or was an offering made after the site was abandoned. B. Lambot and P. Casagrande, 'Une monnaie d'Ebusus sur l'oppidum de " Vieux-Laon" à St-Thomas (Aisne)', Bull. Soc. Archéol. Champenoise 90 (1997), pp. 16-29. From its location, 8 km from Caesar's fortified campaign camp of 57 bc at Mauchamp (Aisne), St Thomas is very likely to be the oppidum of the Remi called Bibrax ( BG II, 6). Caesar sent a force of auxiliaries including Balearic slingers to relieve the garrison, which makes the discovery at St Thomas of a first century bc Balearic bronze coin - the only such find in northern France - of some interest. The numismatic importance of St. Thomas lies in the absence of definite Stage 4 types - including the common Scheers 146 bronze dated to 52 bc or earlier - from a collection of over 220 Gaulish</page><page sequence="28">138 COLIN HASELGROVE the staters (Scheers 30/1) have themselves been found in La Tène D2a contexts at Villeneuve-St-Germain.120 It is worth recalling that Scheers recognised at least five separate varieties of the Class I staters (variants a-e), which might imply a coinage of some duration.121 Although lighter and more heavily alloyed than Scheers 9, there is no a priori reason why Scheers 30-1 should not have overlapped in date with the biface type which supposedly inspired it. The complementary distributions of the two series would certainly permit this. There are also grounds for supposing that the triple-tailed horse types (Scheers 26) began at a date not far removed from Scheers 30-1. Scheers 26-1 conform to the same weight standard as the earliest 'eye' staters, which I would see as the model for a similar eye which appears on the obverse of Scheers 26 from Class II onward.122 Archaeological dating evidence for the triple- tailed series is limited to the discovery of an 'anchor' type stater in the upper fills of the central ditches at Villeneuve-St-Germain, belonging to the abandonment phase of the site (La Tène D2b), consistent nevertheless with a Stage 3 date for the inception of the series.123 Villeneuve also yielded a brass copy of a late uniface stater (Scheers 24- V), this time from a context dating to the main occupation. If reliable, this would place the main development of this series within Stage 3, 124 a view which coins. For the use of St Thomas as a benchmark for types in circulation in Stage 3, cf. also Delestrée, Monnayages , pp. 132-9. 120 Pion, Les habitats Laténiens , vol. III. 121 Scheers herself ( Traité , p. 405) was cautious on this point, noting merely that the details did not allow an order to be determined, if indeed there was one. There is however a slight difference in weight between types a and e, the two most common variants; over 50% of type a coins weigh over 6-2 g, as against only 20 % of the type e. 122 Scheers ( Traité , p. 78) saw the influence going in the other direction, which if correct would make Scheers 26 older than Scheers 30. However, the horse on the reverse of Scheers 30 makes a clean break with the biface series and I see no reason why the issuers of the eye staters should not have devised this emblem independently. Either way, given their similarities, it seems likely that the two series are close to one another in date. The distribution of Scheers 26 is complementary to Scheers 24 and 30 (and indeed Scheers 25), but overlaps more noticeably with the biface type, which might be seen as reinforcing the idea that the main development of Scheers 26 came after Scheers 9. 123 As Pion has shown, limited activity continued at Villeneuve after the main occupation came to a close around the La Tène D2a/D2b transition, cf. n. 29 above. However, as at St Thomas, definite Stage 4 issues are absent from Villeneuve, contrasting markedly with nearby Pommiers, where such coins abound. 124 For the archaeological context, see Pion, Les Habitats Laténiens , vol. I. Although the pottery from the large pit in which this coin was found dates to the La Tène Dlb/D2a transition in Pion's seriation, the pit also yielded 2 of only 16 La Tène D2a arched brooches from the site, one of the latest types in an assemblage of over 400 brooches. This could suggest that there was more than one phase of pit filling, or an intrusion not detected at the time. Coincidentally, another Scheers 24-V stater (this time plated) was found in a gravel pit at Condé-sur-Suippe, occupied in La Tène Dib; there is nothing however to suggest that the coin came from an archaeological feature or even that it was found within the fortifications. Were an earlier dating</page><page sequence="29">IRON AGE COINAGE 139 gains further support from the association of uniface staters and globules-à- la-croix in the Reims-Châlons and Burgundy hoards.125 Also relevant is the representation of Scheers 9 and 24 at different excavated sanctuaries in Picardy. Although the coins themselves are either from later contexts or completely unstratified, there is a tendency for biface staters to occur at sanctuaries which were active during La Tène Dl, and for the uniface types to come from temples dating from La Tène D2 onward.126 This suggests to me that the biface coins had been largely or wholly supplanted by the uniface type when offerings started at these later sanctuaries. The Martberg evidence leads similarly to the conclusion that the Eastern 'eye' staters (Class IV) were already in circulation by La Tène D2a.127 Additional support for this chronology comes from two groups of quarter- staters which occur during Stage 3. The better dated of these is the complex series 'aux segments de cercles' (Scheers 152), which circulated in both the Southern and Central zones.128 Although coins in better quality gold do occur, most examples are in base gold or plated, or made of silver or bronze. Stratified finds come from contexts dating to La Tène Dib at Condé-sur- Suippe and La Cheppe, Camp de Mourmelon; and to La Tène D2a at Villeneuve-St-Germain,129 and Acy-Romance, the latter from a cremation to be upheld, the chronology suggested here would need to be extended by about a generation, placing the starting date for the biface type nearer the mid second century bc - by no means impossible given the apparent date of the Tayac hoard. For another instance of the use of brass in coinage of the mid first century bc, itself potentially an argument for the status quo , see J.-B. Colbert de Beaulieu, 'Les monnaies de bronze de Vercingetorix, faits et critique', Cah. Num. 12 (1975), pp. 358-72. For the coin itself, see J. Debord and E. Huysecom, 'Une contrefaçon en laiton de statère Ambien uniface', Cah. Num. 18 (1981), pp. 54-5. See n. 94 above. The surviving uniface staters from the Reims-Chalons hoard are all of the earliest variety (Scheers 24-1) ; the Côte d'Or find is not fully published. Uniface staters were also occasionally hoarded with Scheers 26, notably at St Quentin (Aisne) and Whaddon Chase (Bucks.), which had one of each; the Bracknall (Berks.) hoard contained 33 Scheers 24-IV staters and 25 triple-tailed 'anchor' types (British QA to QB), all struck from the same obverse die in varying stages of wear (J. H. C. Williams, pers. comm.) 126 Delestrée, Monnayages , pp. 32-96. Three sanctuaries active in La Tène Dl have yielded finds of Scheers 9: Chilly (plated), Digeon (4 coins, plus 1 variant), and St. Maur (1 plated); but only one starting in La Tène D2: Bois L'Abbé (1 coin, plus 1 variant). By contrast, most of the sites yielding Scheers 24 were not founded until La Tène D2: Bois L'Abbé (c.l5 coins, also 2 'anchor' staters), Camp Rouge (1 coin), Dompierre-sur-Authie (1 coin, in bronze). Digeon (6 examples) is the only earlier sanctuary where uniface coins have been found. Another site with Scheers 24 is Vendeuil-Caply, which the excavator dates from the start of La Tène D2; there are however older brooches and potins among the finds, suggesting that there were earlier offerings. For the dating of the sanctuaries, see S. Fichtl, Les Gaulois du Nord de la Gaule (Paris, 1994), p. 25. 127 Wigg, 'Martberg' (forthcoming). 128 J.-M. Doyen, 'Les subdivisions "aux segments de cercles" du type BN 8030: état de la question', in Mélanges Colbert de Beaulieu , pp. 315-30. 129 Scheers 152 were present in several contexts relating to the main occupation, as well as some from the late phase (La Tène D2b); Pion, Les Habitats Laténiens, vol. III.</page><page sequence="30">140 COLIN HASELGROVE dating to the start of this phase.130 The coins are also found in fair numbers at sites like Pommiers and Château Porcien, which were occupied during La Tène D2b, albeit in smaller relative proportions than previously.1" From this, we can infer that Scheers 152 first appeared during La Tène Dib, had its floruit during La Tène D2a, and was still current at the start of La Tène D2b. This is important, as a few coins bear legends, implying that they served as divisions for inscribed staters circulating in the region in Stage 4, which follow on directly from earlier uninscribed issues of the same type. The legend LVC(OTIVS) on Doyen Class II quarter-staters recurs in full on staters of the Southern 'eye' group (Scheers 30-III), while Doyen Class I coins bear the legend VIROS, linking them with the later 'epsilon' staters of the Central zone (Scheers 29-IV).132 While it does not follow that particular classes of uninscribed quarter-staters were divisions for the earlier classes of Scheers 29 and 30, there must be a reasonable chance that they were. This being so, their presence on settlements in the Southern zone at exactly the same date as I have proposed for the introduction of the Class I 'eye' staters is highly relevant. Unfortunately, the converse does not hold: even if we could be certain that the inscribed quarter-staters are the latest in the series, we cannot use the apparent obsolescence of Scheers 1 52 early in La Tène D2b as a terminus ante quem for the corresponding staters; both Doyen Class I and II are extremely rare and could therefore be an isolated striking at any time during Stage 4. 133 A second group of quarter-staters known as the series ' au bateau' (Scheers 13, Gallo-Belgic D; PL 17, 19), occurs fairly widely in the Western zone, as well as in south-east England.134 This series is likely to overlap the uniface staters in date; the two types are frequently hoarded together, display similar patterns of debasement, and in some cases bear the A symbol; many examples of Scheers 13 are in fact uniface. There are, however, indications that the quarter-staters were introduced while the biface staters were still current; the French distribution of Scheers 13, which stops on the southern 130 Friboulet, Les Cimitières , vol. I. Another plated coin of this type was found in the post hole of a building in a part of the settlement apparently unoccupied after La Tène Dia. Over 20 coins were found in post holes in this area, suggesting that many of them were deliberately placed there when the buildings were abandoned, or soon afterwards. The other coins are all potins, none of them types current after La Tène Dib; see Lambot and Méniel, Acy- Romance /, pp. 128-31. Delestrée, Monnayages , pp. 133-7. 132 Doyen, 'Les subdivisions', pp. 315-16, 319. 133 Doyen catalogues a mere 5 inscribed coins belonging to Class I and II, as well as 3 with undecipherable legends (Cl. III-IV), compared to nearly 120 uninscribed examples. 134 The series has recently been re-examined by Delestrée, who identifies a new variety with what he calls a pseudo-helmet on the reverse in place of the usual 'tree' motif; on metrological and typological grounds, he suggests that his 'helmet' type is older than the 'tree' series; see L.-P. Delestrée, 4 L'ensemble des quarts de statères dits " au bateau" en Gaule Belgique', RN 151 (1996), pp. 29-50.</page><page sequence="31">IRON AGE COINAGE 141 fringes of the Somme basin, is if anything closer to Scheers 9 than to Scheers 24, 135 while the quarter-staters are found at as many sanctuaries where there was activity before La Tène D2, as at later ones - although none are usefully stratified.136 We should also note British finds like Carn Brea and Snettisham, which combine 'au bateau' quarter-staters with biface staters,137 while a burial in the Westhampnett (Sussex) cemetery, which was in use during the earlier first century bc, yielded a second-generation insular derivative.138 Taken together, this evidence suggests a starting date for Scheers 13 before the middle of Stage 3. This is as far as the archaeological and numismatic evidence can take us at present with dating the Stage 3 gold. The biface type (Scheers 9) was current in the earlier part of the period, but by the middle of Stage 3, significant changes had occurred, reflected in the minting of the 'eye' and triple-tailed staters (Scheers 26, 30-1), and the two quarter-stater types (Scheers 13, 152). Quite when the uniface coins (Scheers 24) replaced Scheers 9 is more difficult to assess, as it partly depends on the significance attached to the relative weights of issues in the different zones;139 but nothing suggests that this was far removed in time from the appearance of the other types.140 When the peoples of central and eastern Belgie Gaul joined in and introduced related gold coinages of their own - principally the 'epsilon' staters of the Central zone (Scheers 29-1) and the Eastern 'eye' staters (Scheers 30-IV)- is again open to question, but was certainly well before the end of Stage 3. 141 135 Paradoxically, Digeon, which has produced more finds of Scheers 13 (128 coins) than any other site is located right on the southern edge of the distribution. 136 Scheers 13 and related quarter-staters have been found at: Digeon (128 examples); Estrées-St-Denis (1 coin) and Fesques (1 coin), all of which start before La Tène D2; as well as Bois L'Abbé (3 coins) and Dompierre-sur-Authie (1 bronze). The Digeon finds included a hoard of 28 quarter-staters, 26 of them uniface types in fresh condition, and 1 uniface stater (Scheers 24- V) showing traces of wear, which Delestrée interprets as evidence of a post-Conquest date for the quarter-staters. 137 The biface coin from Carn Brea is British A. At Snettisham, a quarter-stater of insular origin was associated with 4 Scheers 9-III staters in Hoard B. Another from Hoard D is one of a group of (presumably) insular coins of good alloy (70 %) which resembles Scheers 13-1, but are smaller and lighter (average 1*45 g); other examples come from Essendon, Shoreham and Selsey. 138 A. P. Fitzpatrick, Archaeological excavations on the route of the A27 Westhampnett Bypass , West Sussex: Volume 2: the cemeteries , Wessex Archaeological Report 12 (Salisbury, 1997), pp. 87-8. The latest biface staters (Scheers 9-1 V, V) and earliest uniface types (Scheers 24-1) weigh marginally more (c.6-3 g) than either of the principal Southern series, both of which began at the same standard as Scheers 24-11, III (c.6-2 g). 140 A study of the wear on Scheers 24 might help in estimating the duration of the series. In his study of the Leuze-en-Hainault find, Huysecom, 'Mont d'Or', p. 106, noted that, while predominantly little worn, the Class II coins showed greater signs of wear than Class III. A quick examination of British finds of Scheers 24 similarly suggests that the earliest classes are slightly less fresh than the rest, although not to a degree which would necessarily rule out the quality of the die engraving as a contributory factor. 141 The Thuin hoard (n. 19 above) contained five distinct varieties ( a-e ) of early epsilon staters (Scheers 29-1), which from their style, weight and relative wear, imply that this class encompassed a period of some duration, potentially decades.</page><page sequence="32">142 COLIN HASELGROVE The subsequent transition to Stage 4 involved further changes, notably the addition of well-formed, meaningful legends to both new and existing types. Beyond these broad brush generalisations, seeking further chronological precision by attempting to synchronise metrological developments over larger areas is not, in my view, valid, given the earlier history of gold coinage in Belgie Gaul.142 It seems to me very likely that the weights employed in Stages 3 and 4 had geographical as well as chronological significance. The principal Southern types, for example, are invariably heavier than those of the Eastern zone, an area with a history of lighter and debased coinages. Although derived from Scheers 30-1, the lighter Class IV 'eye' stater may not be very different in date from its prototype, nor was there necessarily any significant lapse of time between it and the much lighter Scheers 31 coins, as the association of the latter with early types of Scheers 29 in the Fraire-II hoard shows.143 Weight does perhaps offer more guidance to relative date within a single series, but caution is still required given the evidence that some coinages were struck by more than one group, or by the inhabitants of more than one zone (e.g. Scheers 24, 152). Stage 3 saw the introduction of silver in several areas of Belgie Gaul. Amongst the earliest silver issues are the thin, light-weight coinages of the Western zone with an obverse design ultimately derived from a Greek original depicting the head of Athena wearing a long-visored helmet (Scheers 51-52; PL 17, 20), 144 and related types on which the head is replaced by affronted animals (Scheers 53). Stratified finds are known from La Tène Dib contexts at Condé-sur-Suippe and Beauvais, Les Aulnes du Canada (Oise), while Villeneuve-St-Germain produced two examples of Scheers 53. 145 142 Pion, 'L'or des Rèmes ' (forthcoming), suggests that three phases in the evolution of what he terms the " système Belge" can be recognised, based on the weights of successive issues. Phase 1 consists of series with an average weight of 6-2 g (Scheers 24 Cl. II-III; 26 Cl. I-II; 30 Cl. I). In Phase 2, the later issues of these series were joined by other series (Scheers 25 ; 27 ; 29 Cl. I- II; 30 Cl. IV) with weights in the range 5*9-6 0 g. Phase 3 coins have weights below 5-8 g; as well as the latest coins in the existing series, this phase includes Scheers 31. 143 Doyen, 'Les subdivisions', p. 319; the hoard contained 4 Scheers 31 staters, together with 87 staters of the two earlier (I-II) classes of Scheers 29, as well as 4 'rainbow' staters and 10 Scheers 152 bronze quarter-staters. The gold triquetra 'rainbow' staters which inspired the obverse of Scheers 31 were already current in La Tène Dib, as shown by finds from the Heidetränk and Donnersberg oppida , and their presence in the Mardorf hoard (Scheers hoard 56 bis); the Dünsberg, which was occupied from the La Tène D1/D2 transition, has produced gold, silver and bronze triquetra staters; Wigg and Riederer, 'Chronologie', pp. 665-6. 144 For a recent discussion, see Williams, ' Delete-Undelete', pp. 57-8 ; current opinion derives the Picardy helmeted-head tradition from earlier central Gaulish silver types, themselves copied from Greek coins of Emporion. We should not, however, overlook the unique gold quarter- stater depicting the helmeted-head of the Athena (Scheers 8a) found at the Seine-Marne confluence, which Scheers now places with her Sarcelles types; Scheers, 'Sarcelles', pp. 55-6. 145 G.-P. Woimant, 'Beauvais, Les Aulnes du Canada: Viereckschanze ou enceinte quadrangulaire', Rev. Archéol. de Picardie 3-4 (1990), pp. 27-95 ; the coin is a variant of Scheers 51, which Delestrée has christened the St. Maur type; for Condé, see Pion, 'L'oppidum du Vieux Reims', p. 286; this coin is Scheers 53.</page><page sequence="33">IRON AGE COINAGE 143 Related thin silver types also occur at several Picardy sanctuaries, but as with gold, these sites provide only indirect support for the dating.146 From the settlement finds, it is clear that the main Western thin silver types were current by the middle of Stage 3, but precisely when this series started and finished is open to question. The Athena-head tradition also served as an inspiration for various silver issues in both Britain and Armorica.147 The adoption of lightweight silver coinages in the Athena-head tradition, and of struck bronze coinage in preference to potin, sets western Belgie Gaul apart from the Southern and Eastern zones, which instead came under the influence of the so-called quinarius-standard coinages which developed in Celtic Gaul soon after the mid-second century bc and - like the Belgie torc- bearer or boar-standard potins - were widely used outside their primary area of circulation.148 Among the most prominent of these silver coinages was the long-lived east Gaulish Kaletedou series (LT 8291 etc), which occurs fairly frequently on La Tène Dib sites in eastern Belgie Gaul and the Rhineland.149 For a while the imported silver seems to have circulated on its own, but in due course the peoples living on both banks of the middle Rhine began to produce quinarius-style coinages of their own, in contrast to groups in the south of the region, closer to the sources, who continued to rely on 146 Delestrée, Monnayages ; four of the sanctuaries with thin silver finds were already frequented in La Tène Dl (Digeon, Fesques; Ribemont-sur- Ancre ; St-Maur) ; compared to only two with La Tène D2 origins (Bois-L'Abbé; Dompierre-sur-Authie), which accords well with the stratified settlement finds. As many as 13 hoards containing silver were recognised during the Bois L'Abbé excavations (ibid. pp. 36-8) ; although all these hoards are considered to have been deposited in early Gallo-Roman times, it is noteworthy that the four with thin silver coins appear to be archaeologically distinct from the other nine, which are dominated by types characteristic of Stage 4, often from outside the region (including Massaliote obols and, in one case, Roman issues). One of the four hoards contained thin silver only; the other three also included local uninscribed silver types affiliated to the 'à l'astre' series, and in one case a Scheers 25-IIb silver coin. One therefore wonders whether some or all of the latter hoards might not have deposited during Stage 3. 147 Williams, 'Delete-Undelete', pp. 58-9. 148 The normal weight of Gaulish quinarius coinages (c. 1*7- 1-95 g) is a little over double that of the Athena-head issues (c.O- 7-0*9 g). 149 The Kaletedou type is partly copied from the denarius of P. Cornelius Sulla (Crawford 205/1, dated c.151 bc) and probably originated in the third quarter of the second century bc, although for many years it was given a much later dating. At La Tène - where deposition ceased around the La Tène Dla/Dlb transition - the early and middle stages of the series are well represented, but only one later variety was found, while the Lauterach (Austria) hoard - which is unlikely to be later than the penultimate decade of the second century bc - contained an example from the middle of the series, together with 2 south German Kreuzmünzen (dated by their presence in La Tène Dia graves at Dühren and Neckarsulm); 2 La Tène Dib silver brooches; and 24 Roman denarii to c.117bc. From a comparison with Italian hoards of c. 118-1 12 bc, the denarii appear to be representative of the coins in circulation in Italy at the time, and probably represent a single withdrawal from that coinage pool (Kris Lockyear, pers. comm.). It would be surprising if the Kaletedou coin was the only later item in an otherwise contemporary collection. On settlements, the Kaletedou series is frequently associated with the boar-standard potin type. Sites with both coin types in La Tène Dib contexts include Etival- Clairefontaine (Vosges) and Manching.</page><page sequence="34">144 COLIN HASELGROVE imported silver. On the left bank of the Rhine, the earliest local silver coinage was the head/horse series (Scheers 54; PL 17, 21), followed by the sitting person series (Scheers 55 ; PL 18, 22). The order of the two types is confirmed both by archaeological and numismatic data. Scheers 54 is present at the Donnersburg, which was not occupied beyond the La Tène Dlb/D2a transition, while Scheers 55 occurs in La Tène D2a contexts at the Martberg and the Titelberg.150 There are in fact two varieties of Scheers 55, one with the same reverse as Scheers 54, the other with a circle beneath the horse. Not only is the average weight and fineness of Scheers 55 without the circle intermediate between Scheers 54 and Scheers 55 with the circle, but it is also more common in the earliest excavated features at the Martberg than the coins with a circle, a tendency reversed in later contexts.131 Developments on the right bank of the Rhine followed a broadly parallel course. From its presence at the Heidetränk oppidum, where activity ceased about the same time as the Donnersberg, Scheers 56 - the so-called Nauheim type (PL 18, 23) - is likely to be broadly contemporary with Scheers 54. 152 In contrast to the indigenous designs on the two left-bank series, the Nauheim type very obviously borrows from a Roman denarius, that of M. Serveilius, seemingly narrowing down the probable date of introduction to the very start of the first century bc.153 It was followed by the appreciably lighter, ' dancing man ' series (Scheers 57 ; PL 18, 24), which is widespread on La Tène D2 sites. Although both the 'Nauheim' and 'dancing man' series are classified by Scheers as Belgie, their home evidently lay on the far bank of the Rhine. Silver coinages struck on the quinarius standard also made a fleeting appearance in the Southern zone, where the evidence is essentially limited to one site, Villeneuve-St-Germain. Here, four different types were minted (Debord Classes I-IV), often by over-striking inscribed central or eastern Gaulish types including Q. DOCI, KAAETEAOY, and SEQVANOIOTVOS.154 The stratification and associations of the coins demonstrate that all four Villeneuve series were minted during the main occupation of the site (La Tène D2a), rather than being an emergency wartime issue as Fichtl 150 See Wigg, * Martberg' (forthcoming); for the earliest finds from the Titelberg, see R. Rowlett, H. Thomas, and E.-J. Rowlett, 4 Stratified Iron Age house floors on the Titelberg, Luxembourg', J. Field Archaeol. 9 (1982), p. 309. 151 Data in Wigg, 'Martberg' (forthcoming). Interestingly, the example of Scheers 55 from Alésia belongs to the later of the two varieties, in good accord with the dating proposed here. 152 Wigg and Riederer, 'Chronologie', p. 668. 153 The reverse legend ERVEILLI on Scheers 56a is copied directly from the denarius (Crawford, RRC 327/1), which Crawford dates to c.100 bc. Debord, 'Une production tardive', pp. 238-9. 23 of the 57 Villeneuve coins are overstrikes; the identifiable understrikes are 3 Kaletedou silver; 2 of LT 5138, which is similar to Kaletedou but uninscribed; 1 each of Q. Doci and Sequanoiotuos; and 1 uninscribed central Gaulish silver issue (LT 4097).</page><page sequence="35">IRON AGE COINAGE 145 suggested.155 The date of the undertypes also supports this view.156 Debord- I (Scheers 50) was apparently the earliest of the four Villeneuve types - two examples coming from a context which Pion dates to the La Tène Dlb/D2a transition157 - while Debord-IV (Scheers 30/1) seems to be the latest; as I noted above, the obverse of this type appears to be derived from the Class I 'eye' staters. Many Debord-II coins are inscribed DISILLA on either the obverse or reverse -or in one case [DJRim/DISILLA; a few others possess pseudo-legends.158 The boar-standard and torc-bearer potins (Scheers 186, 191) which first made their appearance towards the end of Stage 2, continued to form the main base metal types in circulation in Belgie Gaul for the rest of the second century bc. By the middle of Stage 3, however, potin production had spread from its original core in the south of the region to encompass all the main coin-using areas except the Western zone. These later potin issues were of much better quality and also marginally heavier than their predecessors, and display more regionalised distributions. We can be reasonably sure that certain types were minted at particular sites; Scheers 185-III, 196-11 (PI. 18, 25) and 197 (Pl. 18, 26) appear to belong to Villeneuve St Germain, while Scheers 199, 200 and 201 are all potentially Titelberg issues.159 In northern Champagne, the torc-bearer series was followed by types depicting a sitting 155 S. Fichtl, 'Les fortifications de la Gaule Belgique à La Tène finale: une approche des entités régionales', RAP 3/4 (1996), pp. 223-32. Clientage relations between the peoples of Belgie and Celtic Gaul (BG II, 14) provide one possible explanation for the earlier presence of these overstruck eastern and central types. 156 The Q. Doci type appears to follow on from the Kaletedou series, while the Sequanoiotuos coins (often double-struck or overstrikes themselves) seem to be broadly contemporary; see D. F. Allen, Catalogue of the Celtic coins in the British Museum II (London, 1990), pp. 41-3. On the other hand, the common east Gaulish silver type inscribed TOGIRIX (LT 5550), which follows on from Q. Doci, was not among the identifiable undertypes employed by the Villeneuve moneyers. This type reached neighbouring Pommiers in much greater numbers than any of the Villeneuve undertypes and was certainly current in the mid first century bc; it was by far the commonest silver type at Alésia (72 Togirix were found, compared to 18 Q. Doci and 16 Sequanoiotuos, and a mere 2 Kaletedou), and was later continued by similar but cruder coins (absent from Alésia) bearing the legend Q. IVLIVS/TOGIRIX. The two uninscribed Villeneuve undertypes are represented at Alésia by a single example of LT 4078. Pion, Les Habitats Laténiens , vol. III; see also n. 124 above. The presence of Class I coins in a context dating to the start of the occupation accords well with the order suggested by Debord; the first three varieties are all typologically linked, but due to its greater dispersion, he placed Class I first, while Class III he suggested came last, due to its being the rarest. The links between the first three classes are affirmed by their shared undertypes; either LT 5138 (used once each on Debord-I and -II) or Kaletedou (used on Debord-II (twice) and -III). Neither of these series occurs with Debord-IV, which instead employed one each of LT 4078, Q. Doci, and Sequanoiotuos. Two of these latter types are certainly later than Kaletedou, suggesting that Debord-IV is itself the latest of the four Villeneuve types. Debord, 'Une production tardive', p. 237. 159 For the Villeneuve issues, see Debord, 'Le faciès monétaire', pp. 62-6; for Scheers 199-201, see Loscheider, 'Münzwesen des Trevererlandes', pp. 100-8. Scheers 196-197 were probably already current when Villeneuve was founded, as several examples were found in a context dating close to the start of the occupation.</page><page sequence="36">146 COLIN HASELGROVE man and a bucranium respectively (Scheers 194, 195; PL 18, 27, 28). Absent from the La Tène Dlb oppidum at Condé-sur-Suippe (where the torc-bearer type accounts for 90% of all the potins), both types slightly outnumber Scheers 191 at the nearby oppidum of St-Thomas, where the occupation seems to follow on chronologically.160 The Central zone was home to the long-lived 'au rameau' series (Scheers 190), which probably originated before the middle of Stage 3 (Classes III-IV; PI. 18, 29); this series was continued in Stage 4 by inscribed coins of similar type, which are struck rather than cast (Classes I-II).161 The first struck bronzes to circulate in Belgie Gaul belong to precisely those parts of the Western zone where potin coinage is either scarce or altogether absent. The earliest securely dated Belgie bronze is an uninscribed issue from south-west Picardy (Scheers 120-1; PL 18, 30) found in a La Tène Dlb cremation at Acy- Romance. 162 A similar date is indicated for the earliest bronzes of the prolific 'running/squatting figure' series (Scheers 163-Ia),163 two of which were found in the final infill of the sanctuary enclosure at Gournay-sur-Aronde (Oise). According to the exacavator's recent reassess- ment, this dates to La Tène Dlb.164 A later bronze of the same series (Scheers 163-IIIc) was found in the lower fill of the pit below the later temple, together with a counter-marked Roman quinarius of 99 bc, and pottery of slightly later character; in the layers above were seven torc-bearer potins. The ' running/squatting person ' series is densely distributed in south-west Picardy and lower Normandy and evidently had a long history, extending into Stage 4; another class (Scheers 163-IIb; Pl. 18, 31) was among the Alésia ditch finds, whilst at least three varieties are inscribed (e.g. Scheers 163-Ig, inscribed DVMNACOS). Several other uninscribed western Belgie bronzes are likely to have originated during Stage 3, but firm evidence is so far lacking. Scheers 106 bronzes, for example, have very similar types to the Scheers 196-1 potins, and could well be contemporary. Another prime candidate is Scheers 121, which is linked stylistically to Scheers 120-11 (which has the same obverse type as 160 Lambot and Casagrande, 'Une monniae d'Ebusus', p. 19; Scheers 195 (32 coins) is commonest, followed by Scheers 194 (27 coins) and Scheers 191 (26 coins); 9 Scheers 196 from the neighbouring region have also been found. The earliest stratified Scheers 190 are from Villeneuve; however an unstratified Class IV potin was found at Les Aulnes du Canada, where activity does not continue beyond La Tène Dlb (see n. 145). Beauvais also produced an unstratified potin of Scheers 197, which was certainly extant by the La Tène Dlb/D2a transition. Arguably, the direct association of Scheers 190 potins with Scheers 29 staters in the Peissant hoard (Scheers Hoard 61) adds to the grounds for dating these staters to Stage 3. Lambot and Friboulet, 'Essai de chronologie', p. 131.

The end of Stage 3 saw a number of significant changes in the Southern zone, which in effect herald the transition to Stage 4. These included the introduction of struck bronze; the appearance of crude legends on some series; and the striking of silver types on a heavier weight standard (c. 2*3-2*4 g) thought to derive from the light drachms of Massalia.165 Three of the new series are typologically related to one another, implying that these developments may in some way be connected. These issues comprise the silver coinage inscribed NIDE/AABPAIIOC (Scheers 48 ; PL 18, 32) ; the heavy bronze inscribed AEIYIYIIAYOC (Scheers 155-1), which is linked to Scheers 48 by its obverse and comes from the same region166 - and the smaller KAAOY bronze (Scheers 151 ; PL 18, 33) - which imitates the placing of the NIDE legend on the silver coins, but originated further east, in the middle Aisne Valley. All three series possess barely decipherable legends formed mainly of Greek letters, a trait which marks them out as amongst the earliest Belgie inscribed coinages. An example of Scheers 155-1 was found in the Alésia ditches showing that this series was in circulation by 52 bc, while Scheers 151 is the commonest single type (36 %) among the St Thomas finds, implying that it too existed by the beginning of La Tène D2b. Villeneuve yielded two examples of Scheers 48, placing it in the same period as the two bronze types. However, none of these types have so far been excavated from a context which can definitely be dated to La Tène D2a, so that their introduction at the end of Stage 3 cannot yet be regarded as established, while the two bronze series at least both continued into Stage 4. 167 So far, the equally crude Disilla silver from Villeneuve remains the only inscribed Belgie issue which we can securely assign to Stage 3, 168 and in the present state of knowledge, we can fairly safely assume that coinages with properly formed legends did not appear in Belgie Gaul before the mid first century bc. 165 The rare silver coins inscribed ITENNOVINAOC (Scheers 48) found in the Paris Basin are heavier still (2-7-2-8 g). 166 The name could refer to the former ruler of the Suessiones mentioned by Caesar ( BG II, 4). The type occurs in the right part of southern Picardy for the identification to be plausible, but he may be too early and the name is a relatively common one. Another, later contender is Caesar's ally, Diviciacius of the Aedui, whose people had links with the Bellovaci. 167 In contrast to the almost pseudo-legend on Scheers 155-1, the lighter and relatively well- formed Class II coins of the same series bear dual Greek and (mostly) Latin legends, suggesting a marginally later date and incidentally confirming the correct reading of the name. The potins inscribed ATHA (Scheers 185-1) are another contender. None of these potins have so far been found in a La Tène D2a contexts, but the nineteenth century finds from St- Pierre-en-Chastres (n. 170 below) included 3 examples, while uninscribed potins of the same type (Scheers 185-III) were minted at Villeneuve during Stage 3; another of the uninscribed varieties (Scheers 185-11) was found in the Alésia ditches. A few coins of the Eastern series (Scheers 199) are inscribed KAO.</page><page sequence="38">148 COLIN HASELGROVE One other early Southern bronze which deserves brief mention is the prolific uninscribed type with a Roman-style janiform head on the obverse and a lion on the reverse (Scheers 154). The stance of the animal on the Class II coins (Pl. 18, 34) - which is apparently the earlier of the two classes169 - closely resembles the animal depicted on the earliest silver minted at Villeneuve-St-Germain (Debord Class I; Scheers 50), dating to the middle of Stage 3. As yet, no examples of Scheers 154-11 have been found in La Tène D2a contexts, but their presence in the abandonment deposits at Villeneuve, and at St Pierre-en-Chastres, which ceased to be inhabited about the same time, is consistent with - although not proof of - a starting date at the end of Stage 3. 170 The home of the janiform series seems to be Pommiers, where they are the second commonest type, accounting for one in five of the identifiable Gaulish coins found there (20-7 %). Unfortunately, the date at which Pommiers was first occupied is still unclear due to the limited nature of the modern excavations.171 All that can be safely said at present is that Scheers 154-11 was current during the first of the two principal periods of activity recognised behind the rampart, which dates to La Tène D2b. Six janiform bronzes were found in these earlier deposits, as well as one Villeneuve potin (Scheers 197); three uninscribed bronzes from Celtic Gaul (two of them types present at Alésia); and a late second century bc Roman denarius.172 A Kalou bronze (Scheers 151) was found at the base of the largely sterile deposits which sealed the first period of activity. This sample of coins shows clearly that by the time this Period I occupation ended - whenever that was - the character of coin loss at Pommiers had changed very considerably from earlier sites in the same region such as Villeneuve-St-Germain or St Thomas, shown both 169 The well-formed Scheers 154-1 coins are absent from Villeneuve and Pommiers Period I, whereas 2 examples (but no 154-11) were present in the group of 273 coins excavated at Pommiers in 1883-4, which dates to Period II. Since 154-11 outnumbers 154-1 by c. 5 to 1 among the modern surface finds in the interior, its absence from this group is likely to be significant. In addition, the lion on 154-1 is similar to the one depicted on Scheers 28-IV bronzes, which date to Stage 4. 170 The oppidum at St-Pierre-en-Chastres was excavated in 1867 as part of the research programme instigated by Napoleon III. The excavated coins comprised 26 potins (6 Scheers 186; 6 Scheers 191 ; 6 Scheers 196; and 8 Scheers 198), 3 bronzes (1 Scheers 154; 2 Scheers 163) and 1 quarter-stater (Scheers 152), giving an overall composition very close to Villeneuve. A limited sondage in 1972 yielded La Tène D2a pottery, but does not seem to have resulted in further coin finds. 171 Apart from a section through the rampart, the 1987-88 excavations were confined to two small trenches behind the defences, totalling c. 150 m2 for a site of approximately 40 ha. 172 For the coins see, P. Brun and J. Debord, 'Monnaies trouvées en fouilles sur l'oppidum de Pommiers (Aisne)', RN 33 (1991), pp. 43-59. The Period I deposits were sealed by clean sand and gravel, thought to derive either from the destruction of the rampart, or from a period of abandonment, when the defences ceased to be maintained. A second phase of intensive occupation followed (Period II), which seems to have ended in the penultimate decade bc.</page><page sequence="39">IRON AGE COINAGE 149 by the dominance of struck bronze (83 %), and by the high proportion of coin types from outside Belgie Gaul (33%). 173 Stage 4 (c. 60-20 bc) Archaeologically, Stage 4 covers the end of La Tène D2 and the start of the Roman period, up until the establishment of the Augustan military bases on the Rhine. This stage is marked by the rapid proliferation of struck bronze at the expense of potin, which it abruptly supplanted throughout Belgie Gaul; the amount of non-Belgic coinage in circulation also increased, as Pommiers shows. Contrary to received opinion, however, Belgie silver and gold coinage did not simply disappear at the Roman conquest but was still sometimes minted after the mid first century bc. Legends quickly became widespread, some series bearing dual inscriptions in Greek and Latin characters, although most employed Roman lettering only. Most coin types, however, were still essentially indigenous in character, and comparatively few series are heavily Romanized. Equally, while certain Stage 4 coinages circulated fairly widely, many others were evidently localised issues, only rarely found beyond the confines of the particular district where they were produced. Although the Roman conquest undoubtedly played a significant role in these changes, it is virtually impossible to distinguish monetary developments which occurred during the Gallic war from those which took place in its wake. Only six Belgie types were present in the one deposit which is fairly securely dated to the period: the Camp D ditches at Alésia. Four were series which were in circulation well before the end of Stage 3, while a fifth (Scheers 155) may have been current before Caesar's invasion.174 This leaves just a single bronze type (Scheers 146, inscribed REMO/REMO), which is more likely to have come into existence at the time of the Gallic war.175 With its well-formed legend and Roman-style Victory driving a chariot (PL 18, 35), this type is very different in nature from the earlier bronze and potin found 173 A sample of 22 coins from the latest features at Villeneuve consisted of 64% potin and only 14% struck bronze (another 2 coins were bronze Scheers 152 quarter-staters); non-Belgic coins from a mere 9 % of the assemblage. 174 For the Belgie types found at Alésia, see n. 1 1 above. Many of the other Gaulish coins in the Camp D ditches can similarly be shown to have been in circulation well before 52 bc. A similar pattern is evident with the weaponry, much of which dates from La Tène D2a, although elements more characteristic of La Tène D2b, such as spiked shield bosses and hinged brooches, were also represented; see T. Lejars, 'L'armement des Celtes en Gaule du Nord à la fin de l'époque gauloise', RAP 3/4 (1996), p. 98. 175 The dating of Scheers 146 to the 50s bc rests on its absence from the La Tène D2a site at St. Thomas and the presence of 3 examples (2 of them stratified) at Alésia. Another Scheers 146 bronze was found in an undated well at Caesar's probable campaign camp at Mauchamp, where it is the only Iron Age coin recorded. Its existence by 57 bc is difficult - but not impossible - to reconcile with its absence from St Thomas, the prime contender to be Bibrax , the oppidum defended by the Remi in the same campaign (n. 119 above).</page><page sequence="40">150 COLIN HASELGROVE in the same area, suggesting that, in the Southern zone at least, changes may have been extremely rapid. Without comparable evidence, the dating of any other Belgie coin types to the 50s bc is essentially conjecture; in numismatic terms the mid to later 1st century bc is best treated as a single stage.176 Several of the gold coinages introduced in Stage 3 continued on into Stage 4. These include the Southern 'eye' series, now inscribed VOCARA1MT or LVCOTIOS (Scheers 30-11, III; PL 18, 36) in well-formed Roman letters, and the Eastern 'eye' staters with the legend POTTINA (Scheers 30-V ; PL 18, 37). The number of dies implies that all three types were minted in some quantity.177 Their gold content, however, was significantly reduced compared to Stage 3, either by using poorer alloys (Classes II-III), or by a sharp drop in weight (Class V).178 In the Central zone, the latest 'epsilon' staters were inscribed VIROS (Scheers 29-IV ; Pl. 18, 38), and are lighter and richer in copper (c.30%) than the earlier stater types. As we have seen, the legends LVC(OTIOS) and VIROS are also found on debased quarter-staters of the series 'aux segments de cercles' (Scheers 152; Doyen-I, II), demonstrating that these too continued into Stage 4. Similar trends are apparent in the Western zone: the latest 'uniface' coins bear a A monogram (Scheers 24- VI, VII; Pl. 18, 39) on the obverse, and are lighter and baser than previous classes, Class VI being rich in copper (c.28 %), while Class VII is actually bronze. Related quarter-staters again exist, this time belonging to the series 'au bateau' (Scheers 13-VI; PL 18, 40). The British derivatives of the Scheers 26 'anchor' type underwent a similar switch to copper-rich alloys and then acquired legends, initially in the name of COMMIOS.179 Although some of these developments may well have been precipitated by the Roman conquest, nothing links them specifically to the events of 57-51 bc. As we have seen, equally pronounced falls in weight and fineness had occurred in earlier periods, well before the Roman intervention in Belgie Gaul. The hoard evidence is also subject to ambiguities of interpretation. 176 Pion, Les habitats Laténiens, vol. III, suggests that Scheers 146, with its three heads on the obverse, and the janiform-head series (Scheers 154) from the Soissons area, should be seen as counterparts, dating both series after Caesar's arrival. However, I would see the inception of Scheers 154 as contemporary with the slightly earlier Kalou bronzes (Scheers 151). 77 Scheers records just over 30 reverse dies each for 30-11 and 30-III, compared to 109 for 30- I. The number of recorded dies for the Eastern series Scheers 30-V (83) is actually double that for 30-1 V (42). This disparity is reflected in the site finds from the Titelberg and the Martberg, where Pottina staters outnumber uninscribed staters by 13 to 1; Loscheider, 4 Münzwesen des Trevererlandes', p. 151. 178 The average gold content of Scheers 30-III is 42-5% compared to 60% for Scheers 30-1; the mean weight of Classes II-III (c.6-0 g) is also lower than for Class I (c.6-2 g). The average weight of the Pottina coins (c.5-45 g) is 0-5 g less than Scheers 30-IV (c.5-95 g); see Loscheider, 'Münzwesen des Trevererlandes', p. 203. Bronze coins with types analogous to the 'eye' staters occur occasionally in central Belgie Gaul and elsewhere (Scheers 30/2-30/4). 179 These include uniface coins (British QB), weighing c.5-8 g, with copper contents varying between 14% and 36%; late British QA coins weighing c. 5-4 g, with a copper content c.36%; the Commios staters have a copper content of 31 % and weigh c.5-4 g; see M. R. Cowell, 4 An analytical survey of the British gold coinage', in M. Mays, Celtic Coinage in Britain , p. 217.</page><page sequence="41">IRON AGE COINAGE 151 'Eye' staters are very rarely found in hoards, whereas the uniface and 'epsilon' staters were deposited in enormous numbers : at least 23 substantial hoards containing one or other, or occasionally both, types are recorded in Belgie Gaul, as well as numerous multiple finds of less certain status. At first glance, it is tempting to relate this hoarding pattern to the political stance of the different Belgie peoples. The Belgie confederacy and the Nervii both opposed the Roman invasion in 57 bc and there was further bitter fighting in these areas up until 51 bc, whereas the Remi and - at least until 54-53 bc -the Treveri welcomed the Romans. However, the hoards could span a much longer period of time. Examining the 13 major finds with some record of the constituent classes, we find that three close with the earliest classes of Scheers 24 and 29 - which would allow them to predate the Roman invasion by some decades180 - while Kwaremont, one of four deposits terminating with the latest types, contained Roman coins up to the early first century ad.181 A further six hoards end with issues belonging to one of the two main intermediate stages.182 In addition, several hoards come from locations with a possible religious significance, such as bogs or springs. Although this need not preclude the coins having been hidden in periods of unrest, it does raise other possibilities. The remaining Stage 4 gold coinages were noticeably more localised, and were accompanied by closely-linked silver and bronze issues. These trimetallic currencies include the western Belgie series 'à l'astre' (Scheers 25) ;183 the Southern issues inscribed CRICIRV and ROVECA (Scheers 27, 28); and the Eastern series inscribed ARDA (Scheers 30a). Apart from Scheers 25, which may have started during Stage 3, none of these coinages seem to predate the mid first century bc and many of the relevant issues are probably still later. In Arda's case, this is shown by the copying of Roman and Numidian prototypes dating to the 40s bc (Pl. 18, 41), 184 and by the excavated evidence from the Titelberg, where the relative proportions of bronze types in 180 Châlons-Reims; Largny (both Scheers 24-1); and Thuin (Scheers 29-1). Frasnes-lez-Buissenal; Ledringhem; Kwaremont (all Scheers 29-1 V) and Longueil-Ste- Marie (Scheers 24- VI). 182 Aubigny; Fraire-II (both Scheers 29-11); and Mont d'Or (Scheers 24-III); followed by Pierregot; St. Quentin (both Scheers 24-IV); and Stritjem (Scheers 29-III). The pattern of Scheers 24 hoarding in Britain is quite different. 10 finds terminate with Scheers 24-II/III, but only 2 with Scheers 24-IV (Fring, Norfolk, which has only 1 Scheers 24-IV coin compared to 146 of Classes I-III ; and Bracknall) ; and none with Scheers 24-1, although Classes I and IV are both reasonably common in Britain. No British hoards containing the rarer Classes V-VII are known. 183 L.-P. Delestrée and C. Delplace, 'La série trimetallique à l'astre témoin du monnayage bellovaque', Mélanges Colbert de Beaulieu , pp. 253-74. 184 Loscheider, 'Münzwesen des Trevererlandes', pp. 173-5. The obverse of the earliest Arda silver issues (Silver-I) is hubbed from a quinarius of Juba I of Mauretania, dated 48-46 bc, while the obverse of one of the bronzes (Scheers 30a II) is copied from the denarius of Terentius Varro ( RRC 447/ la, dated c.49 bc). Several other Arda issues show the influence of Roman denarii (although the precise prototypes are uncertain), or share types with Belgie bronzes in other zones.</page><page sequence="42">152 COLIN HASELGROVE successive deposits suggests that most or all of the Arda bronze (Scheers 30a- II, III, V) postdates the series inscribed A. HIRTIVS (Scheers 162-1; Pl. 18, 42). 185 This latter coinage, which copies the elephant denarius of Julius Caesar, itself dates no earlier than the late 50s or 40s bc.186 Unless the Arda bronzes are of quite different date to the precious metal issues - which seems unlikely - this indicates that the minting of gold did not cease abruptly at the Conquest. Both gold and silver were struck at weights little different from the preceding precious metal types (Scheers 30-V ; Scheers 55) found in the same area, although the gold is appreciably baser.187 As Creighton has argued, the iconography employed on some of Arda's coins closely recalls the imagery exploited by Octavian' s party during the struggle for power which ended in the defeat of Anthony in 31 bc.188 Arda's first silver issue bears on one side a picture of Victory and on the reverse, a rider carrying a spear on a rearing horse, copied directly from the earlier denarius of P. Crepusius (Scheers 30a-II).189 Both images are potent symbols of Octavian's growing ascendancy, the latter a direct allusion to the gilded equestrian statue which he was granted in 43 bc. A different equestrian statue, where the horse is stepping, appears on the reverse of one of Arda's bronzes (Scheers 30a-II), this time paired with a bust of Jupiter on the obverse. After Gaul fell under Octavian's control in 40 bc, it is highly likely that in keeping with existing Roman practice in dealing with strategically important peoples on the fringes of the empire, he installed a number of his own clients - members of the Gaulish elite whose patron he had become after 185 Metzler, Titelberg , p. 145. Additional evidence indicating that the Arda series might be later in its entirety than the Hirtius bronzes comes from the Martberg, where David Wigg (pers. comm.) has noted that there appear to be two separate areas of deposition, one associating Hirtius coins with Stage 3 silver and potin issues; the other consisting of Arda and Roman issues. 186 Hirtius was in Gaul between 54-50 bc and again in 45-44 bc, when he held the title imperator. This enables the separate western Belgie series inscribed A. HIR. IMP (Scheers 153) to be securely dated to the mid 40s bc (Hirtius was killed in 43 bc). I doubt however the validity of the argument (. RPC 1, p. 148) that Scheers 162-1 ought therefore to date to 51-50 bc, and that Sydenham's dating (54-51 bc) of the elephant denarius should consequently be preferred to Crawford's (49-48 bc). While both types might indeed be earlier, the omission of any reference to Hirtius' title on Scheers 162 is not decisive one way or the other; Belgie coins do not follow conventions in the same way as Roman coinage, and the two Hirtius series were minted by different Belgie peoples. 8 Arda's silver averages c.1-6 g (Cl. I is heavier than Cl. II) against a peak weight of 1-75-1-79 g for Scheers 55; the gold (c.5-4 g) is slightly below the peak weight for Pottina (c. 5*45-5*49 g). The difference in gold content is at least 7%. See Loscheider, 'Münzwesen des Trevererlandes', pp. 203-210. 188 J. Creighton, 'Links between the classical imagery in post-Caesarian Belgica and the rest of the Roman world', in J. Metzler and D. Wigg (eds), Die Kelten und Rom: neue numismatische Forschungen, Studien zu Fundmünzen der Antike (Berlin, forthcoming). As Creighton notes, the use of conservative designs for Arda's gold coins as opposed to the more Romanised silver and bronze types, need not indicate an earlier date; a similar phenomenon recurs in the coinage of British rulers like Tincomaros or Tasciovanus. 189 RRC 361/lc, dated c.82 bc.</page><page sequence="43">IRON AGE COINAGE 153 Caesar's death -as rulers in these territories. Creighton has recently suggested that such individuals may have acquired a familiarity with the visual language employed by Octavian's faction through being taken to Rome as hostages by Caesar when they were young; auxiliary service with the Roman army during and after the civil war is another possibility.190 The imagery used by Arda, combined with the presence of all five bronze types in La Tène D2b contexts at the Titelberg, suggests a date range centring on the 30s bc.191 A similar date can be proposed for three other Belgie series with equestrian types. The first of these, the bronze inscribed ANDOBRV/ GARMANOS (Scheers 46; PI. 19, 43), comes from the Arras area, in the far north of the Western zone. It has a native-style helmeted head on one side, but the horse and rider on the reverse are almost identical to the Arda bronze (Scheers 30a-II). The legend links Scheers 46 to two silver issues on the quinarius-standard from the same area, one inscribed GARMANOS/ COMMIOS (Scheers 45; PL 19, 44), the other CARSICIOS/COMMIOS (Scheers 47). Scheers 45 features a helmeted head not dissimilar to Scheers 46, with a riderless horse on the reverse, while Scheers 47 copies the denarius of M. Lepidus, which has a diademed female head on one side and yet another equestrian statue on the reverse.192 Although both silver issues are usually assumed to refer to the Commios whom Caesar made king of the Atrebates in 57 bc, an alternative and possibly more plausible explanation is that the other individuals named on the coins, Garmanos and Carsicios, are younger members of the same dynasty.193 The third issue featuring an equestrian type, albeit of less Roman character, is the bronze inscribed 190 Creighton, 'Classical imagery' (forthcoming). For the suggestion that the choice of Civil War types of Arda's coinage came about as a result of members of the Gaulish elite having served as auxiliary cavalry in the 40s bc, see Loscheider, 'Münzwesen des Trevererlandes', pp. 173-83. 191 Although the layers in question are often treated as having a precise TAQ from tree-ring dating, this is not so. Two oak beams, with a felling date of 31 bc, were found in the ditch bordering the principal street; they came from a fairly sterile layer sandwiched between two deposits which were rich in occupation debris. The lower of these layers (Schicht a) produced only La Tène D2b finds, whereas the upper layer (Schicht c) has early Roman material. Although the wood provides a TPQ for Schicht c, the converse does not apply to Schicht a, since we do not know when the wood was actually discarded; a terminal date into the 20s bc is therefore possible. The other main La Tène D2b deposit (Schicht 1) seems to close somewhat earlier than Schicht a, but a precise date cannot be determined; see Metzler, Titelberg , pp. 138-9. 192 RRC 419/1, dated c. 61 bc. Creighton, 'Classical imagery' (forthcoming); see also n. 12 above. Although Commios joined the revolt of 52 bc, he eventually came to terms with Anthony and gave hostages as a guarantee that he would live where bidden provided he never had to come face to face with a Roman ( BG VIII, 23). Creighton plausibly argues that Commius was therefore sent to Britain where he was possibly made ruler of the British Atrebates (shown by the commencement of gold coins bearing his name) ; Hirtius' version is to be preferred to the story of Commios' flight to Britain recounted by Frontinus nearly 150 years later. Commios' pact with Anthony means that it is entirely plausible to envisage other members of the same dynasty exercising authority in northern Belgie Gaul a decade or two after the Conquest - particularly if they were among the hostages given to Anthony.</page><page sequence="44">154 COLIN HASELGROVE VIROS (Scheers 29a; Pl. 19, 45) which circulated in the adjacent part of the Central zone. Viros could be the same individual whose name appears on the latest 'epsilon' staters (Scheers 29-IV), or a descendant.194 The trimetallic Southern coinages inscribed CRICIRV and ROVECA (Scheers 27-28) are closely related to one another and probably overlapped in date, although the coinage of Roveca, who has more silver and bronze types, may have lasted longer. In both cases, the silver issues follow the weight standard of the earlier NIDE/AABPAIIOC coins from the same region (Scheers 48), 195 while the gold is descended from the triple-tailed horse series.196 Both series share imagery with coins from outside the region; the head on the obverse of Criciru's silver is inspired by the head of Artemis on Massaliote drachms, possibly via earlier southern Gaulish imitations,197 while the head of Venus on one of Roveca's bronzes (Scheers 28-V) is copied from a Roman denarius.198 The lion on a second Roveca bronze issue (Scheers 28-IV ; Pl. 19, 46) closely resembles ones depicted on various other Belgie bronzes including the later janiform issues (Scheers 154-1), while the helmeted head on the obverse of the same Roveca type is almost identical to the one on Cricirv's sole bronze issue (Scheers 27; PI. 19, 47). 199 The reverse of one of Roveca's silver types (Scheers 28-1) has a mounted Gaulish warrior reminiscent of the one portrayed on Viros' bronzes. One difference between the coinages of Cricirv and Roveca is that Scheers 27 employs Latin lettering only, whereas Scheers 28 has dual legends in Greek and Latin. It shares this feature with the stylistically similar bronzes inscribed EPENOS (Scheers 143; PI. 19, 48), which are found in the same area and presumably came from the same mint. Their joint territory of origin lies a little to the south of the Criciru coinage, which was evidently minted at Pommiers, where 194 Although the Viros staters employ traditional designs, this is no reason why they should not be contemporary with the bronzes (cf. n. 188 above); equally, a relatively late date is quite possible, given their apparent association in the Kwaremont hoard with Roman denarii up to the reign of Tiberius. 195 Criciru silver coins generally weigh 2*1-2-3 g, while Roveca's silver peaks at 2-3 g; the peak weight of Scheers 48 is 2-4 g. 196 The Criciru staters are derived directly from Scheers 26- V and initially inherited the same weight standard (c.5-9 g), whereas Roveca's gold is more distantly related to the triple- tailed horse series and is also lighter (c.5-8 g). Neither gold coinage was on a large scale to judge from the number of dies identified by Scheers. 197 LT 2657, attributed to the Volcae Arecomici; Scheers, Traité , p. 377. 198 Either the denarius of C. Egnatius (RRC 391/1), dated c. 75 bc, or one of Caesar (RRC 468/1), dated c.46-45 bc. 199 Other bronzes depicting lions include the western Belgie series inscribed SVTICOS (Scheers 163-11); and the heavily Romanized Pixtilos bronzes (LT 7105, Cl. IX), which come from the area between the Loire and the Seine but are also common in Belgie Gaul. The helmeted head on the obverse of the same Pixtilos bronze imitates the denarius of C. Vibius Varus ( RRC 494/38), dated c.42 bc. Other Pixtilos types which copy Roman denarii include Class I (TPQ cAl~46 bc); Class V (c.43 bc; c. 39 bc?); and Class VIII (c.55 bc), suggesting a date for the series in the late 40s and 30s bc; see S. Scheers, Un monnayage post-Césarien des années 40-30 av. J.-C. : les monnaies à la légende Pixtilos, RN 21 (1979), pp. 57-83. The later Pixtilos classes are on the same weight standard as the Roveca and Epenos bronzes.</page><page sequence="45">IRON AGE COINAGE 155 it accounts for almost precisely half the 2000 identified Gaulish coins from the site.200 The much discussed brooch depicted on the Criciru gold staters (PI. 19, 19), usually assumed to be a collared or disc-threaded type, offers little help with the dating.201 Although both brooch types are most often found in early Roman deposits, collared brooches do sometimes occur in La Tène D2b contexts (as at Besançon, the Titelberg, and in Goeblange-Nospelt grave D); moreover, the brooch illustrated on the coins could easily have been a precious metal type, in which case, we would hardly ever expect to find examples in archaeological deposits.202 As Allen noted, the Criciru staters with a wing on the obverse (Scheers 27-1) were struck, often inaccurately, from a limited number of dies and are virtually unworn, whereas the staters on which a five-petalled flower takes the place of the wing (Scheers 27-11) have fewer die-links, implying that we have only a small sample of a larger coinage.203 Neither the Criciru nor the Roveca issues are easy to date. Two Scheers 28- III bronzes and one Scheers 28-Ia were found in the latest La Tène D2b deposits at the Titelberg, showing that this series existed by the 30s bc,204 although its absence from the slightly earlier Schicht 1 might be significant. Scheers 27, on the other hand, is entirely absent from the equivalent deposits, and both at the Titelberg and in the 1988 excavations at Pommiers, occurs only in the earliest Gallo-Roman contexts, leading Pion to date the Criciru series to the period after 30 bc.205 There is, however, some uncertainty over when the Period II occupation at Pommiers began;206 and while most 200 The distribution of Scheers 27 is very similar to the janiform bronzes (SI 54) minted earlier at the same site. Some of the Scheers 27 bronzes are inscribed CRICIRONIS instead of CRJCIRV, but it is not yet clear whether this distinction has chronological significance. D. F. Allen, 'The fibula of Cricirv', Germania 50 (1972), pp. 122-32. 202 W. Krämer, 'Silberne Fibelpaare aus dem letzten vorchristlichen Jahrhundert', Germania 49 (1971), p. 131, Tafel 28-29, illustrates two arched brooches with discs moulded on to the bow, one of gold, the other of silver; both are believed to come from Italy and have similar profiles to the type depicted on the staters. Precious metal brooches like these could well have provided the prototypes not only for the coins, but also for the collared and disc-threaded types. For collared brooches in La Tène D2b contexts, see Metzler, Titeiber z , pp. 202-9. 203 Allen, 'Cricirv', p. 127, argued that the wing-marked coins were the later of the two classes, representing a resumption of gold coinage in an emergency issue after an interval; however, both weight and typology imply that they preceded the flower-marked coins; cf. Scheers, Traité , p. 70. R. Weiller, 'Die Münzfunde aus der Grabung vom Titelberg', Publications de la Section Historique de r Institut Grand-Duché de Luxembourg 91 (1977), p. 126. 2 examples of the helmeted head type (Scheers 28-IV) were found at the Villeneuve-au-Châtelot temple in contexts which need not be any later; see J. Piette, 'Le site des "Grèves" à La Villeneuve-au-Châtelot (Aube)', in Brunaux and Gruel, Monnaies en fouilles , pp. 211-35. 205 Pion, Les habitats Laténiens , vol. III. 206 Apart from the difficulties created by the limited extent of the 1988 excavations at Pommiers, there is still some doubt over when the Romanized artefact types characteristic of the Period II occupation first appeared in the region. As Pion notes, this could turn out to be closer to 40 bc than 30 bc, which would raise the starting date for the Period II occupation accordingly.</page><page sequence="46">156 COLIN HASELGROVE stratified finds from elsewhere seem to be Augustan or later, a few might be earlier.207 It therefore seems premature to rule out a starting date for the Criciru series in (or even before) the 30s bc.208 The western Belgie series 'à l'astre' (Scheers 25; Pl. 19, 50) presents even greater chronological uncertainties. Unlike the other trimetallic sets, this coinage is normally uninscribed and there are both staters and divisions. Both the gold and silver have close links with the earliest bronze types belonging to the 'running/squatting person' series (Scheers 163-Ia), which were current in the same general area from around the middle of Stage 3 ;209 while the weight range of the gold mirrors that of the triple tailed horse (and Criciru) group, which has a complementary distribution to the east.210 On the other hand, in addition to forming a trimetallic set, the 'à l'astre' types display certain other characteristics more at home in Stage 4; Class II staters are sometimes struck in bronze, while the smaller bronzes begin with the same types as the quarter-staters.211 A number of derivatives series also occur, both in silver and in bronze, including an unusually heavy bronze coin (c.10-5 g) bearing a Romanized name; this combines an obverse which recalls the bronze staters, with an elephant copied from the denarius of Julius Caesar on the reverse.212 Whether or not the 'à l'astre' series started during The contrast between Pommiers, which has hardly any later first century bc Roman issues, and the Titelberg, where they are relatively abundant, should also be noted. 207 These include 2 Scheers 27 bronzes from the foundations of the later first century bc temple at Gournay-sur-Aronde, which Brunaux dates to the pre- Augustan period ; and a Scheers 27 bronze from a cremation burial at Epiais-Rhus associated with 2 La Tène D2b brooches and pottery which the excavator dates c. 20 bc-ad 20, but does not illustrate. 3 more Scheers 27 bronzes were found at Epiais-Rhus in less well-defined contexts, one of them apparently containing only La Tène D2 pottery, the others more mixed; see Brunaux and Gruel, Monnaies en fouilles , pp. 20-31; 156-66. 208 Another possible indication of an earlier starting date is the Ambleny hoard (Scheers Hoard 2), which contained 98 Criciru staters (2 of them Scheers 27-1) and 53 uninscribed triple- tailed horse staters (including 4 Scheers 26-1 V). Also relevant are the Vendrest hoard (Scheers Hoard 88), which contained 5 Criciru bronzes together with 7 Roveca silver (CI. Ha) and 3 Roveca bronze (1 CI. Ilia; 2 Cl. IV); and Bois L'Abbé, Hoard 1976-1-244, which contained 23 Gaulish silver, comprising 7 Belgie issues of Stage 4 (1 Scheers 25, 1 Scheers 27, 1 Scheers 41, 4 Scheers 45); 1 of Stage 3-4 (Scheers 57), and 15 other Gaulish issues - 10 of them types present at Alésia (including 7 Togirix); together with 1 British silver coin (Mack 376; BM 2950) and 4 Roman issues down to RRC 529/4, dated to c.39 bc. 209 See n. 163 above. The horse on Scheers 25-IIb silver is very similar to that on Scheers 163- Ia bronzes (Scheers, Traité , p. 669), while the stars above and below the horse on the reverse of the gold staters are paralleled in the running person series both on the earliest type (Scheers 163- Ia) and other, potentially later varieties (e.g. Scheers 163-Ik; Ilia); cf Delestrée, Monnayages , p. 26. 210 The weight of Scheers 25 quarter-staters peaks c. 1*45-1 -5 g, equivalent to the biface 'au bateau' types (Scheers 13-III). Delestrée and Delplace, ' La série trimetallique', p. 260-1. Bronze Scheers 26-III staters do also occasionally occur. 212 Delestrée, Monnayages , p. 111. Q. Iulius Telidhi was presumably one of many Gaulish leaders awarded Roman citizenship at some point -not necessarily immediately - after the Roman conquest; see J. F. Drinkwater, Roman Gaul (London, 1983), pp. 19-20. As Allen noted</page><page sequence="47">IRON AGE COINAGE 157 Stage 3, some coins in this tradition must belong to Stage 4. The silver issues are struck on the quinarius standard and represent a clear break with the lighter Athena-head types previously found in the area; for what it is worth, their peak weight (1-75-1-8 g) is only marginally less than the silver coins minted at Villeneuve-St-Germain during the latter part of Stage 3 by overstriking imported central or eastern Gaulish types.213 Apart from the coins which form sets with other gold and bronze issues, only a few silver types were minted in Belgie Gaul during Stage 4. By far the most important of these was the quinarius series inscribed ATEVLA/VLATOS (Scheers 41; PI. 19, 51), which is found throughout northern and eastern France. Confirmation of its Belgie origin is provided by a stylistically-related series with the legend SENODON/CALEDV (Scheers 42, Pl. 19, 52), which was probably struck by the same mint; this type has a much more restricted distribution - albeit somewhat dispersed - implying an origin in the far west of Belgie Gaul, where Ateula/Vlatos is also common.214 The latter series seems not to have been in existence by 52 bc, as it is sufficiently common in eastern France for its absence at Alésia to be significant. It must however have been introduced fairly shortly thereafter, since both it and Scheers 42 are present in several large western and central Gaulish silver hoards dating to the late 40s or early 30s bc.215 The only other Stage 4 silver of any consequence is a lightweight quinarius type inscribed ANNAROVECI (Scheers 58) from eastern fringes of the Central zone bordering the river Meuse.216 On major settlements at least, if not necessarily in the countryside, struck bronze rapidly replaced potin throughout the zone where cast bronze had previously flourished.217 The majority of Southern sites first occupied during La Tène D2b yield virtually no potins. At Reims, later first century bc deposits in the rue du General Sarrail produced 18 struck bronzes against {Coins of the Ancient Celts , p. 81), the name Criciru on Scheers 27 might well be connected with Q. Tullius Cicero, who served in Belgie Gaul as one of Caesar's commanders between 54-52 bc. Possibly a leading pro-Roman Gaul adopted his name, although if so, this offers no more than a TPQ for the coinage. 213 All but a few of the Villeneuve coins weigh over 1-8 g. For a hoard from Bois L'Abbé (1971-1-33), containing one Scheers 25-IIb coin in association with other early western Belgie uninscribed silver issues, see Delestrée, Monnayages , p. 36 and n. 146 above. The Senodun/Caletedu coins seem to be marginally heavier than the Ateula/Vlatos types, implying they may be the earlier; at least one-third of Scheers 42 coins weigh over 1-9 g, compared to only a handful of Scheers 41-1, which are mostly in the range 1-6-1-9 g; Scheers 41- II is lighter still, most coins weighing between 1-5-1-8 g. Several of the hoards with Scheers 41 also contained Roman coins, notably Vernon ( TPQ of 45 bc); Compreignac (43 bc); Rozel (39 bc); Arbanats (38 bc); and Chantenay-St-Imbert (31 bc). 216 Scheers, 'Frappe et circulation', pp. 14-16. The silver triquetra staters found in the lower Rhine area and their bronze derivatives were both in use during Stage 4, but probably begin earlier; Wigg and Riederer, 'Chronologie', p. 669. 217 Guichard, Pion et al., 'Circulation monétaire', pp. 47-8.</page><page sequence="48">158 COLIN HASELGROVE only one potin, while at Château-Porcien (Ardennes) and Pommiers, potins form a mere 7% of the total finds.218 The three principal bronzes found on La Tène D2b sites in the territory of the Remi were the Kalou (Scheers 151) and Remo/Remo (Scheers 146) issues which first appeared late in Stage 3 and early in Stage 4 respectively, and the heavier series inscribed ATISIOS REMOS (Scheers 147; PL 19, 53).219 Like many other Stage 4 coinages, this latter type depicts a lion on the reverse, in this case coupled to a native-style head on the obverse. It is generally assumed that Scheers 146 and 147 were issued by separate mints, although they may simply be different denomi- nations. Where they do however differ is in their distributions; like the earlier Kalou bronzes, Scheers 147 is essentially confined to the Southern zone, whereas Scheers 146 is found over a much wider area. One puzzling question is the complete absence of Scheers 146 from the prolific site of Pommiers. Geographical factors seem unlikely to be responsible, since Scheers 146 occurs on other local sites, including Ambleny (only 5 km to the west) and Condé-sur-Aisne (where 73 were found). In contrast, Scheers 147, although rare at these other two sites, is reasonably abundant at Pommiers.220 It is tempting therefore to suggest that Scheers 146 - already current in 52 bc - achieved its maximum circulation between the two periods of occupation at Pommiers. But caution is needed, since the Titelberg evidence implies that Scheers 146 in fact continued in use rather later than Scheers 147.221 Although this might be a question of residuality,222 this view receives some support from the temple at Villeneuve-au-Châtelot (Aube), where there are potentially relevant variations in the composition of the finds from different areas; the purely Gaulish offerings at the north-east corner of the enclosure included 21 Scheers 147 (but no Scheers 146), whereas there were 18 Scheers 146, and only 7 Scheers 147, among the offerings at the eastern entrance which continued down to the Augustan period.223 This apparent contradiction cannot be resolved without new evidence, the one 218 Delestrée, Monnayages, pp. 133-8. The stratified bronzes from the rue du General Sarrail site comprised 10 Scheers 151,7 Scheers 146 and 1 Scheers 147. At Pommiers, there were 9 struck bronzes and 1 potin in the Period I deposits (n. 172 above), while potins account for only 1 % of the substantial Period II assemblage excavated in 1883-4 by Vauvillé. 219 Scheers 147 has a peak weight of 5-5-5-75 g, compared to c. 20-2-6 g for Scheers 146 and 1*6-1-8 g for Scheers 151. 220 Pommiers yielded 20 Scheers 147, 5 of them (25%) coming from the Penod II group excavated by Vauvillé in 1883-4; the type is absent at Ambleny and only one example was found among the offerings at Condé-sur-Aisne. The earlier Scheers 151 bronzes are even better represented at Pommiers, 63 having been found at the site; as might be expected, the proportion of these from the 1883-4 group is lower (8 %). One example was found at Amblény and the type is absent from Condé-sur-Aisne. 221 There were 4 coins of each type in the La Tène D2b layers, whereas in the earliest Gallo- Roman deposits (Schicht c), Scheers 146 outnumbers Scheers 147 by 7 to 1. 222 Scheers 146 outnumbers Scheers 147 by 5 to 2 m the overall site assemblage, while the early Scheers 151 bronzes, although absent from the stratified sequence, are well represented among the unstratified finds from the same area. See Brunaux and Gruel, Monnaies en fouilles , pp. 211-35.</page><page sequence="49">IRON AGE COINAGE 159 point of reasonable certainty being that both Scheers 146 and Scheers 147 were current during La Tène D2b. The replacement of potin by struck bronze seems to have been as rapid in the Central and Eastern zones. In the former area, potin is invariably a fairly minor component of Iron Age coin assemblages (c.5-20%) at sites which were founded in the later first century bc such as Blicquy, Braives, Fontaine- Valmont, Kruishoutem and Liberchies.224 Apart from the Viros bronzes (Scheers 29a), the two principal Stage 4 bronze coinages found in the region are the inscribed 'au rameau' types (Scheers 190-1, II), some of which bear the legend VARTIŒO (Scheers 190-IIa; PL 19, 54) ;225 and heavier issues inscribed VERCIO (Scheers 145; PL 19, 55). The latter type is related stylistically to the Viros coins, although the lion depicted on the obverse is not without affinities to the Atisios Remos coins (Scheers 147). A similar pattern is apparent in the Eastern zone. Even at the Titelberg, where the incidence of residuality is likely to be high due to continuous occupation from La Tène Dl, the incidence of potin in the earlier La Tène D2b deposits is only 23%, falling to 8% in Schicht c.226 Apart from the A. Hirtius and Arda bronzes, the three most important Eastern bronze coinages were the series inscribed MEDIOMA (Scheers 138) and ARC AMBACTI (Scheers 139-11) which come from the area along the Franco-German border, and the helmeted-head types inscribed MATUGENOS (Scheers 137) found along the river Meuse. Much of the imagery employed recalls other Stage 4 bronzes; Scheers 139-II, for example, depicts a lion on the reverse, while the helmeted head on Scheers 138 (Pl. 19, 56) resembles the Garmanos coins (Scheers 45-46) ; its reverse types depict a mounted warrior (Class I), and a winged horse (Class II), the latter engraved in a style similar to the winged lion on certain Roveca bronzes (Scheers 28-I).227 Many of these types have peak weights c.2-75-3 0 g, suggesting that they were struck to a common standard.228 An example of Scheers 139-11 was found in Schicht a at the Titelberg, implying that this type, at least, was current by the late 30s bc. On other coins belonging to the same series (Scheers 139-1; Pl. 19, 57), the native portrait is replaced by an unwreathed head imitating that of Octavian (36-29 bc) or Augustus (27-20 bc), perhaps implying that this type was minted after 224 Scheers, 'Frappe et circulation', p. 46. 225 Colbert de Beaulieu, 'Chefs mentionnés', pp. 419-46, suggests that Vartice might be the Nervian leader, Vertico, who defected to the Romans in 54 bc (BG V, 45). 226 Metzler, Titelberg , p. 142. 227 Another link between the two series is the presence of the title ARCANTODAN, abbreviated on Ambactus' issues but inscribed in full on the Roveca bronze (Scheers 28- la). 228 These include Scheers 137-8; the two Hirtius types (Scheers 153; Scheers 162-1); and Scheers 154. Scheers 27-28 and Scheers 143 are all only marginally, if at all, heavier. The Arda bronzes display a rather greater range, which might indicate the existence of more than one denomination: Scheers 30a I-II weigh just over 3 0 g, while Scheers 30a III-IV are c.2-5-3 0 g; Scheers 30- V, however, is lighter, at 1-3-1-9 g.</page><page sequence="50">160 COLIN HASELGROVE Augustus' reorganisation of the Gaulish provinces. Another Ambactus bronze has a bucranium on the obverse (Scheers 140), probably imitated from the sestertius of C. Antius Restio,229 and an eagle on the reverse inside a wreath; such features could well indicate an early Augustan date for this type too.230 Another late Eastern type bearing the retrograde legend CARINA (Scheers 162-11) is dated by the reference to C. Carinas, who was governor of Belgie Gaul in 31-30 bc; like the earlier A. Hirtius coins in the same series (Scheers 162-1), this type was probably minted at the Titelberg. At major oppida like the Titelberg and Pommiers, the transition to struck bronze was accompanied by an augmentation in the number of coin types from outside the region. This influx included silver and bronze coinage from all over eastern and central Gaul, as well as some types from further south, including Massaliote issues. Pommiers, for example, has produced 27 Togirix silver (LT 5550) and 20 bronzes attributed to the Carnutes (LT 6088 etc.) - both series which had started to penetrate the region in small numbers before the end of Stage 3, as the Villeneuve-St-Germain finds show - as well as 23 Massalia obols and 18 of the later Pixtilos bronzes (LT 7078 etc). Many of these types recur on other sites in the region. Roman coins, however, are notably rare. There were none among the group of 273 coins excavated at Pommiers in 1883-4 and only one from the 1987-8 excavations.231 More tellingly, there are no stratified Roman coins among a group of 39 excavated at the entrance to the western Belgie oppidum at La Chaussée-Tirancourt (Somme), despite the coins being associated with small finds which imply a Roman military presence at this very site.232 Owing to its longer tradition of struck bronze coinage, developments in the Western zone generally appear less abrupt than elsewhere in Belgie Gaul and are also more difficult to follow due to the acute lack of settlement assemblages dating to this period, the majority of finds coming from religious sites. A number of series which began in the earlier first century bc such as the 'running/squatting person' coinage (Scheers 163) evidently carried on into Stage 4, marked only by the acquisition of legends, while the period is 229 RRC 455/4, dated cAl bc. 230 Scheers, Traité , p. 165. 231 Roman Republican and Augustan issues account for 1 % of the total Pommiers finds. This figure excludes the poorly recorded hoard of c.100 Roman and Gaulish silver found under a stone slab in 1875, which included 2 coins of Togirix (LT 5550); 7 of Dubnocov/Dubnoreix (LT 5026); and 5 of Anorbo/Dubno (LT 4972); there were at least 5 Roman denarii down to L. Cassius Longinus (?) (RRC 413/1), dated c.6 3 bc. All three Gaulish silver types were in existence by 52 bc, implying that the hoard is contemporary with the Period I occupation. 232 L.-P. Delestrée, ' Le numéraire gaulois, témoin d'une présence militaire sur le site fortifié de la Chaussée-Tirancourt', Cah. Num. 34 (1997), pp. 5-13. The high proportion of silver coins (61 %) suggests the presence of a scattered hoard or votive offerings rather than normal losses from circulation. Even so, the dominance of non-Belgic types (69%), which include 5 Togirix silver and 14 Massalia obols, is probably genuine. A mere 20 % of the coins were local issues, a further 1 1 % coming from other parts of Belgie Gaul.

The situation is especially complex in the Somme basin, where there is a plethora of different bronze types, generally with animal designs on one side if not both, many of them inter- related.233 Inscriptions are rare and most of the relevant types are devoid of Roman influence; it would be surprising if some of them did not go back to Stage 3. Similar coins are frequently found in Kent, introducing an additional layer of uncertainty as to which issues are Belgie and which British. The exceptions to the rule include the horse-horse and boar- horseman bronzes inscribed VOCII-CA (Scheers 80b) and VOCI ACA (Scheers 80e; Pl. 19, 58) ;234 a head-horse type (Scheers 59; PL 19, 59), on which the head is copied from the denarius of C. Calpurnius Piso; and two types derived from an inscribed Iberian silver issue of the second to early first century bc.235 The first of these, from Digeon, is a direct copy of the prototype;236 on the other, the head is replaced by a volute design, while the original legend is rendered IMONIO (Scheers 104). Among the western Belgie bronze coinages which can be definitely attributed to Stage 4 is the head-horse series inscribed VIRICIVS (Scheers 109; Pl. 19, 60), which probably originated in the coastal area around Bois L'Abbé, where it is the dominant type, and the SVTICOS /RATVMACOS series (Scheers 164), which shows a significant degree of Roman influence. Three classes copy denarii, including an issue of Julius Caesar, dated c. 46 bc (Scheers 164-IV),237 while the reverse of Scheers 164-1, with a bull and boar underneath, is almost identical to one of the Arda types (Scheers 30a- V). There are also several typological links to the well-dated Pixtilos bronzes,238 suggesting that like them, Scheers 164 belongs to the 40s and 30s bc. A similar date is indicated for the ECCAIOS series (Scheers 176; PI. 19, 61); the obverse of Scheers 176-1 copying the same denarius of Caesar as Scheers 164- IV, while Scheers 176-11 has a rearing equestrian type reminiscent of the Arda silver (Scheers 30a-II). The relatively rare lion type with the legend SOLLOS (Scheers 170), which occurs in the same area as the Eccaios bronzes - although its home was possibly on the borders of the Central and Southern zones -also seems to belong to this period, as an example was found in Schicht a at the Titelberg.239 233 Delestrée (. Monnayages , pp. 26-8, 100-2) uses the term 'fonds commun des Ambiani' to group the different series, which encompass at least 27 separate types. 234 An example of this type was found in Schicht 1 at the Titelberg, together with one of Scheers 80d; a third bronze in the series (Scheers 80c) was found in the Schicht a, providing confirmation of a La Tène D2b (or earlier) date for the series. 235 The type is attributed to the Bascunes of Tarragona; it has a bearded head on the obverse and a mounted warrior on reverse, beneath is the legend IMONES. 236 Delestrée, Monnayages , p. 24. 237 RRC 458/1 ; the legend VELIOCAOI on the reverse of the same bronze type suggests a link to the people of the same name, which the distribution would endorse. The obverse of Scheers</page><page sequence="52">162 COLIN HASELGROVE From the foregoing, it will be apparent that no Stage 4 bronzes can be positively demonstrated to post-date the Augustan reorganisation of Belgie Gaul, although some might well do so (such as Scheers 139-1), and it is quite possible that other established series continued to be struck during the 20s BC. The impression that the bulk of coin production in Stage 4 was concentrated in La Tène D2b is reinforced by the absence of new types from the earliest Gallo-Roman groups (e.g. Pommiers and the Titelberg) - the Criricu series (Scheers 27) providing the one significant, albeit rather implausible, exception.240 Another index of change in the early Augustan period is supplied by the hoard record in Celtic Gaul: whereas silver hoards with Roman coins up to the 30s bc are fairly common, those with Roman types after this date are essentially of bronze.241 Stage 5 (c. 20 bc until the early 1st century ad) During the Augustan period, particularly from 15 bc onwards when Roman troops were first stationed permanently on the Rhine and following the opening of the mints at Nîmes and Lyons, the quantity of Roman coinage in circulation in Belgie Gaul began to increase rapidly. Three examples will suffice, two from relatively close to the frontier, the third from further west. At the Titelberg, Roman issues account for less than 5 % of the coins in La Tène D2b layers, even though Roman troops were probably garrisoned on the site at some stage; on the other hand, in Schicht c, dated c.25/20-5 bc, they comprise 53% of the coins.242 A similar pattern is apparent at the Martberg; here Roman coins are altogether absent from the lower levels of 164- VII copies the denarius of Ti. Claudius (RRC 381/1), dated c. 79 bc, while the obverse of Scheers 164-1 - which is also found on Pixtilos bronzes (Cl. VII, LT 7081) -probably derives from the denarius of M. Plaetorius ( RRC 409/1), dated c.67 bc. Scheers, Traité , pp. 155-6. 239 The sanctuary at Vermand (Aisne) is the only site with a significant number of finds. 240 The 1883-4 finds from Pommiers included 2 examples each of the helmeted head-bull type inscribed EIVICIAC (Scheers 157) and the janiform-head-lion type inscribed CAITIO/AMANDI (Scheers 158). Neither of these seem likely to be significantly later than the other minority types present in the group, which included one A. Hirtius Imp. coin (Scheers 153-1). The remainder are either broadly contemporary (Scheers 28, 147, 154-1) or earlier still (Scheers 24, 151, 155). In addition to 2 Criciru coins, the Period II deposits excavated in 1988 yielded one Scheers 59 bronze and a LT 7988 bronze (which is present at Alésia). 241 Allen, Coins of the Ancient Celts , p. 94. 242 Weiller, 'Münzfun de', pp. 124-5. 85 of the Augustan coins from these deposits are Nemausus asses (c.20-10 bc), compared to 3 asses from the Lugdunum- Altar first series (c.7-3 bc) and 2 quadrantes (c. 15-10 bc); for chronological shifts in the pattern of supply to successive Roman forts in Germany, see D. Wigg, 'Coin supply and the Roman army', in Roman Frontier Studies 1995 (ed. W.

Two important series can nevertheless be dated with a fair degree of confidence after c. 15 bc, one heavily Romanized, the other still essentially in the native tradition. The first of these coinages, inscribed GERMANVS INDVTILL1 L (Scheers 216; PL 19, 62), appears to be modelled on the relatively rare quadrans struck at Lyons c. 15-10 bc, and like it, was made of brass rather than bronze. The type is a common find in late Augustan and Tiberian contexts throughout Belgie Gaul and was still plentiful in Claudian times.245 The second series is more complex, apparently starting with coins bearing the legend AVAVCIA (Scheers 217-Ia), which were then followed by other issues which were all uninscribed (Classes Ib-III; Pl. 19, 63). There is a cluster of finds in the Central zone which may well betray the area of origin, but the main feature of the distribution is the very close association with Roman military sites on both banks of the lower and middle Rhine. Both Scheers 216 and 217 are very similar in weight to Augustan quadrantes (c.3-0 g), and were perhaps used as their equivalent.246 The two series were certainly in existence by 8 bc, when the early Roman fortress at Oberaden was abandoned, while the presence of over 850 Scheers 217 bronzes at the later site of Haltern - occupied c.8/5 bc-ad 9 - has led Wigg to date the latter series primarily to the last decade bc.247 Scheers, however, suggests an earlier date, based on the close resemblance between the Class I Avaucia coins and the Annaroveci silver issues (Scheers 58), which cluster in the same area west of the Meuse as the non-military finds of Scheers 217.248 One possibility is that there was a gap in time between the inscribed bronzes and the more numerous uninscribed issues - both varieties have the 244 E. Huysecom, 'Contribution à l'étude des monnaies Celtiques II', RBN 128 (1982), pp. 27-38. 245 Haselgrove, 'Les potins "au personnage courant'", p. 54-6. 2 6 As Wigg notes, in the case of Scheers 217, any correspondence with the quadrans was probably coincidental; the Belgie coins are marginally heavier, with a peak weight of 3*25-3*50 g, compared to 3*0-3*25 g for the Roman type. Availability was presumably a major factor in their use at the Roman forts, see D. Wigg, 'The function of the last Celtic coinages in northern Gaul', in C. E. King and D. Wigg (eds), Coin Finds and Coin Use in the Roman World , Studien zu Fundmünzen er Antike 10, (Berlin, 1996), pp. 415-24. The intentions of the makers of Scheers 216 is more open to question, given its similarity to the model and the choice of brass in preference to bronze; however, the weight (2*75-3*0 g) is not only slightly below the quadrans , but identical to many Belgie bronzes dating to Stage 4 (and even Stage 3), suggesting that the makers deliberately adopted a well-established indigenous standard. ibid., p. 420. Oberaden yielded a mere 3 examples. 248 Scheers, 'Frappe et circulation', pp. 11-23.</page><page sequence="54">164 COLIN HASELGROVE same amount of copper (average 93 %), but differ in their minor constituents ; Class la contains silver and antimony, whereas Class II has lead, and either arsenic or tin.249 The sheer quantity of finds from the Augustan military sites certainly argues a date for the bulk of the series not far removed in time from the forts themselves. A third group of bronzes found in the territory of the Bellovaci is probably later still, since one variety depicts an altar on the reverse taken from the Lugdunum- Altar first series, dating between c.7-3 bc (Scheers 214-1; PL 19, 64). This, however, is the exception. By the first century ad, indigenous minting had effectively come to an end, although the more gradual rate at which Roman coinage penetrated areas away from the major centres ensured that Gaulish bronzes continued in use well into the century. When local minting did eventually resume in some parts of Belgie Gaul in the Claudian period, it was to produce imitations of Roman coin types, whether to meet a shortage caused by failures in the supply of official issues, or to satisfy an increased demand for low-value coinage as this came to be used in an ever wider range of transactions.250 Such developments, however, lie beyond the scope of this paper. Table 1 Chronological development of Iron Age coinage in Belgie Gaul Phase Duration Comment Stage 1 3rd century bc Half-stater gold coinages inspired by Greek models Stage 2 c.200-125 bc Broad flan gold coinages and introduction of potin coinage in southern Belgie Gaul Stage 3 c. 125-60 bc More regionalised gold and potin coinages; introduction of silver; struck bronze coinage in western Belgie Gaul; occasional use of inscriptions Stage 4 c. 60-20 bc Debased gold coinages; tri-metallic sets; replacement of potin by struck bronze; use of legends becomes general Stage 5 C.20 bc - early 1st Last indigenous coinages; rapid increase in Roman century ad coinage in circulation POSTSCRIPT In conclusion, I will briefly set out the implications for British developments of the proposed chronological framework. British finds of Stage 1 coins are essentially confined to east Kent and comprise a small number of Picardy half- and quarter-staters, and a few Philippus staters of diverse origin. With one exception, the Belgie imports come from later stages of the Picardy series (Scheers 3-4), which implies that it was not until later in Stage 1 that gold started systematically to reach south-east England. As the 249 Roymans and Van der Sanden, 'Celtic coins from the Netherlands', XIV, nos 38, 13-14. Wigg, 'Function', pp. 431-4.</page><page sequence="55">IRON AGE COINAGE 165 two Normandy half-staters found at Ribemont-sur-Ancre demonstrate, Stage 1 coins could travel outside their area of origin, and there is thus no reason why the British finds should not be third century bc imports. The next generation of gold coinages circulated over a much larger area of south-east England (Gallo-Belgic A-B). An earlier dating for the Tayac hoard would allow the broad-flan series - and by implication the defaced types - to have come into use in Britain in the earlier second century bc, up to half a century earlier than hitherto considered likely. An equivalent revision of the starting date for British potin may well prove necessary, now that there is convincing evidence for Belgie production before the mid second century bc, particularly as the earliest insular potin are far closer to the Massaliote prototype than most Belgie series. It would be surprising, too, if some varieties of Gallo-Belgic A and B do not turn out to be British, while nothing has emerged to alter my view that Gallo-Belgic A continued to circulate in south-east England for some time after it was replaced by Gallo- Belgic C on the continent. A late second century bc date for the start of Stage 3 opens up similar possibilities for insular varieties of Gallo-Belgic C, and the first generation of British derivatives (British A1-A2, etc). From hoard associations, the earliest geometric quarter-staters (Gallo-Belgic D-British O) are unlikely to be significantly later, whichever side of the Channel this series originated. The existence of early Athena-head silver types and of the first struck bronze types in the coastal region of Belgie Gaul before the middle of Stage 3 means that we should also be prepared to envisage an earlier starting date for related series in Britain such as the Hampshire thin silver types and the cock bronzes from the Chichester area. The spread of gold to the rest of southern and eastern England probably unfolded broadly in parallel to the development of regional coinages modelled on the biface type in Belgie Gaul, although the insular coinages (British B-H) are generally cruder, and of poorer weight and alloy, than their continental counterparts. The date at which the uniface Gallo-Belgic E staters were imported to Britain remains an open question; the continental evidence would permit a starting date for the type well before the mid first century bc, but the hoard evidence from Britain can be read as suggesting that most of the uniface coins were imported over a relatively short period. One variant of Scheers 24-IV was probably minted in Britain, but apart from contributing to the genesis of other British uniface series (British L, Q) and some borrowing apparent in the later biface series (British I-J), the series had only limited influence in Britain. Most of the changes associated with Stage 4 in Belgie Gaul soon manifested themselves in Britain. These included the switch to copper-rich alloys in the British continuation of the anchor series (British QA) and other contemporary coinages (e.g. British L); the adoption of legends, seen first on</page><page sequence="56">166 COLIN HASELGROVE the Commios staters; and the obsolescence of the Kentish flat linear potin series. Peoples on either side of the Thames began to strike bronze coinages on a much larger scale than before, many of them closely related to those of western Belgie Gaul, while the use of silver became general, although the weight standard appears to be unrelated to the Gaulish quinarius.251 The coinages minted by Commios' descendants in southern England and their contemporaries north of the Thames, have much in common with those of individuals like Arda and Roveca in Belgie Gaul. Both Tincomaros and Tasciovanus started by minting coins in traditional style, but as their reigns progressed, they made increasing use of Roman imagery, including equestrian types. Although I have previously argued that this trend had its origins in alliances forged by Augustus with various British rulers after c. 20 BC in the build-up to the Roman campaigns in Germany, Creighton's work raises the possibility that these developments started in the 30s bc or 20s bc.252 At this point, however, British and continental developments diverge. Where the imitation of Augustan types is commonplace in south-east England, in Gaul such borrowing is rare. The Belgie peoples had by then become habituated to Roman coinage, and the opening of the Augustan mints at Nemausus and Lugdunum removed any residual need to produce coinage locally, unless in exceptional circumstances. British client kings, on the other hand, continued to mint their own coinage, albeit influenced by contemporary monetary developments across the Channel, as is evident from the direct copying of Lugdunum issues by Tasciovanus and his successors ; by their occasional experimentation with new denominations and metals like brass; and by the increasingly sophisticated manipulation of coin types for self-promotion, notably through the use of Victory types and the title Rex.
