[" The evolution of science in the last century may be regarded as a continuous process of disintegration of the Kantian synthetic a priori." First, the concept of probability.was shown to be logically prior to that of causality. The principle of induction, however, remained an unsolved problem. Wittgenstein and Carnap attacked the problem of meaning, defining logic as " the totality of tautologies ", and a tautology as " a combination of elementary propositions which remains true for all possible truth- values of the elementary propositions ". Every kind of metaphysics thus becomes 'meaningless'. Further, it appeared that meaning is no real entity but reducible to a relation between physical objects. So " logistic positivism became logistic materialisit ". However, " the pre- dictive character of science " could not be justified in this way. So Reichenbach appeals to his theory of probability, according to which no proposition about the future claims to be certainly true and the truth- values " are replaced by a continuous scale of probability ". This leads to an answer also to the problem of induction: we get no demonstration indeed that induction must lead to success, but it is our best chance.] xxxiii., 7. C. J. Herrick. 'Is Truth a Value ? ' [Attacks M. H. Moore's argument in xxxii., 20., that truth cannot be a value if it is defined as a function of interest, because the truth of a proposition is independent of our interest in its truth. This is " to cut ourselves off from any hope of an effective articulation of propositions of either truth or value into the vital problems with which both science and philosophy are properly con- cerned ". It would " devitalize science and sterilize philosophy ", and if Aristotelian logic sanctions such procedures, the sooner it is supplanted by another the better.] R. Rothman.

[Holds that " all natural events should be treated in terms both of causality and contingency " and that so " we are not inevitably headed towards glory or ruin or any other predestined fate. What will come will be in large part a function of our courage and our understanding."] R. Kroner. 'Philosophy of Life and Philosophy of History.'

[Taking the variable-given as including the hypothetical, the inferred, and even the fictional and the non-existent, we must agree how the various givens are to be inferred from one another. The variable-given seems to be implied in all science, which "never attempts to set up the limits of the knowable ". It has also the advant- ages that it lumps together all suppositional entities into a single class, brings out the relativity of the distinction between invention and</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 545 discovery, and shows the difference between rationalism and empiricism to be only one of degree.] C. J. Ducasse. 'Verification, Verifiability, and Meaningfulness.' [An assertion being something which answers or forestalls a question, and a question being about something not itself in question but given, its 'truth' is tested by a specified verificatory procedure. But this may not be actually carried out, though it seems possible theoretically. How then shall we be sure that it is even theoret- ically possible ? The answer suggested is that the theoretic procedure must be sufficiently like, and relevant to, procedures already recognised.] E. W. Hall. ' Of what use is Metaphysics ? ' [After rejecting the views of G. E. Moore, Wittgenstein and S. C. Pepper, the author declares that metaphysics " does deal with the class of all existents ", attempting to abstract " the general form of existence which constitutes the uniqueness of any given qua existent ".] xxxiii., 10. J. Dewey. ' Characteristics and Characters: Kinds and Classes.' [" If propositions about singulars, characteristics and kinds, and propositions about universals, characters and classes bear a necessary logical relationship to each other, then logical theory must recognize both types of propositions, and is under obligation to frame a coherent theory of their relation. The confusion of the two types, exemplified in constant use, in current texts, of generic and uni- versal' propositions as being of the same form, both begs the question at issue and obscures what is probably the most fundamental problem of logical theory."] H. G. Alexander. ' Linguistic Morphology in Re- lation to Thinking.' [Illustrates the differences in the morphology of languages from the various ways in which time-relations are expressed in a number of American Indian languages, and so suggests what would probably be a very fruitful inquiry into the development of ' categories'.] P. A. Bertocci. 'The Authority of Ethical Ideals.' [" At any moment in the development of ideals, whatever ideal is considered the best by the critical intellect evokes that ultimate desire-transcending experience which we designate by 'ought'. "] xxxiii., 11. J. Dewey. 'What Are Universals ? ' [Discusses the question in the traditional way, in terms of realism, nominalism and conceptualism, but adds that " every universal is a formulation of an operation to be performed ", and that " a physical or existential law " can never become more than probable because its proof always involves an affirmation of the consequent. Holds further (1) that by taking the relation of universals to individuals as logical rather than ontological the old Platonic difficulty of participation may be avoided; (2) that since " the universal is determined with reference to powsible applicability", it does not dwell in a separate realm " independent of any and all application "; (3) that the universal is ideal in the sense of being notrmative or prescriptive; (4) that it is subject to revision. ". The idea that the universals are already, in and of themselves, Eternal Objects, Essences, etc., and that by trial and error we finally hit upon the par- ticular one which is applicable to particular cases is gratuitous." In short, Dewey seems to think that more is to be gained by patching up the Platonic theory of universals than the Aristotelian.] T. A. Goundge.

[A highly amusing article, arguing that " psychology, in the modern world, is the result of an impossible effort to be, at one and the same time, Aristotelian and Cartesian ". Were it faithful to Cartesian dualism, it would not attempt to correlate ' matter-events ' with ' soul- events'. Hence " psychophysical parallelism, interactionism, double- aspect theories-all of these are disguises for a surreptitious theology ", needed because " psychologists without laboratories are dreadfully un- happy, and without theology they cannot ask administrative heads for rooms and gadgets with which to amuse themsel,ves. . . They affirmed that if they could only be given some pickled brains and some electrical machinery, they could tell what goes on in the soul, because what goes on there has an accompanying going-on somewhere else. . . . A simple faith in the competence of rational theology have these psychologists. And they did get their laboratories, together with monkeys and white rats."] Abstracts of Papers read at the 37th Annual Meeting of the Western Division of the American Philosophical Association, State Uni- versity of Iowa, April, 1936. xxxiii. 14. W. Jewell=Lapan. 'Per- ception and Reality.' [Thinks that " the difficulties of the realist have arisen from not distinguishing between perception and knowledge ". It .is ' meaningless' to assert that we perceive the world as it really is, and false that perception is knowledge. If sensations and perceptions are taken as processes and not existences, it is irrelevant to ask whether they are ' subjective' or 'objective '.] C. Barrett. 'In what Sense are, Values Objective ?' [" In the sense that such things as life are objective." As leading up to this answer it is argued (1) that a valuing organism could not evolve ' naturally' in a valueless universe, (2) that a world-order devoid of value could not either stimulate or satisfy the universal human demand for vobjectification of values, (3) that on no naturalistic theory are the permanence, contrasts, imperatives, and communicability of value-experi- ences explicable.] M. W Hess. ' A Note on Criteria.' [Comment on E. Vivas, xxxiii., 3.] REVUE DE METAPHYSIQUE ET DE MORALE. 42e Annee. No. 1. January, 1935. L. BRIUNSCHVICG, Religion et Philosophie. [Address de- livered before the 8th Congress of Philosophy at Prague. Begins by dis- tinguishing two philosophical attitudes towards religion, viz., the " idealist ", which accepts religion as the revelation of a supernatural reality, escaping ordinary methods of verification, and the " positivist ", which treats religion as a " human function ", like science and morals, subject to the same standards of judgment, a chapter in the "natural history " of the human mind. Philosophy appeals to " reason ": what can reason do with religion ? There is the way of dogmatism, which erects a system on arbitrary premises. But the recognition of the arbitrariness of alternative premises leads to scepticism. Both dogmatism and scepticism have been exploited in the interests of religion. But when religion has been defended</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 547 in terms of a particular philosophical system, itself religiously neutral, or "profane ", religion has become exposed to the attacks to which the system itself has been open. On the other hand, when defenders of religion have sought to argue that, because different dogmatic systems cancel each other out, therefore religion can stand without philosophical support, they invite the retort that, similarly, the differences between religions lead to religious scepticism. By contrast, Brunschvicg advocates a third way in which reason can deal with religion, viz., by re-interpreting it so as to give it a rational content; " rational ", in the same sense in which science is rational. There can be but a single truth, and religious truth is simply truth. Reason ("'the Word ", Logos) is God. What we need is a transformation " of religion of Nature sublimated into religion of Nature surmounted ". Theism, in its historic forms, has been merely religion of Nature sublimated into an anthropomorphic God with an anthropocentric interest. Religion of Nature surmounted cultivates a disinterested objectivity of outlook, re- nouncing all privileged position for man on earth. This objectivity has its scientific form in the search for factual truth, and its moral form in emanci- pation from exclusive individual or national interests and in the service of a universal altruism. Thus science and morality, no longer antagonistic, lead on to the reign of reason both in theory and In practice, which will be the true reign of God. Brunschvicg concludes with a plea for international peace and co-operation in the name of the one true religion of reason, under- lying the many diverse historic faiths. This will be Christianity perfected: " it is one and the same thing to learn to think and to learn to love ".] L. Dugas. La Theorie de la Memoire affective chez Maine de Biran. [The problem is: can we at will recall feelings, emotions, the sentimental colour- ing of past events, as distinct from recalling these events themselves ? This question becomes partly: How to distinguish a feeling recalled from a feeling imagined or even a feeling re-felt (i.e. the present experience of a feeling more or less of the same sort as the feeling experienced in the past) ? Partly, again, the question is: What means, i.e., what " signs ", have we by which to effect the recall of a feeling ? Can words play that part ? The language of feelings is other than the language of " ideas ", and the best language for the former is music, thus showing that ideas and feelings are, in principle, separate and distinct. Signs may represent; they may evoke; they may excite. The signs for feelings tend to excite, rather than to represent or evoke, thus substituting imagination or fresh present feeling for genuine recall. Yet, as the example of Proust's works shows, the skilful use of ideas and images may evoke feelings experienced in the past.and thus mediate that memory of feelings, the nature and conditions of which Maine de Biran was trying to analyse.] J. Devolve. R61e estheltique de la ReBcurrence (premier article). [I find the word recurrence, as used by the author, untranslatable by any single English word. It means at once emancipation from the utilitarian, practical, interested attitude in the apprehension of an object, and the achievement of a disinterested attitude in which the percipient experiences a sense of the fundamental unity of Reality, conveyed to him by the universal significance which the object, eesthetically apprehended, reveals to him. The word " recurrence " is used because the author regards the enjoyment of this unity of Reality as characteristic of the fundamental immediacy of experience which is broken up by the analysing and relating work of thought, largely under the pressure of practical urgencies, and to which, in oesthetic experience, we return or recur. One of the author's examples may serve to illustrate what he means by r&amp;currence. Baudelaire's poem, La Charoyne, has for its subject a re- pulsive putrefying carcass, which in practical lIfe evokes only an emotion of</page><page sequence="5">548 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. aversion and a reaction of avoidance, but which for the poet's vision retains " la forme et l'essence divine "' of the loves it had experienced, thus being a symbol at once of death as the destiny of all living things and of love as the glory of all life. The first stage of recurrence is this emotional purifica- tion and the recovery of naive, child-like sympathy of apprehension; the second, " creative imagination ", is the elaboration in appropriate imagery of the universals which have thus become visible in the particular, and of the emotional mood appropriate to them. At this stage the work of art is bom. The essential function of recurrence is " to open or re-establish the communication between the obscure unity of Reality and the rational clarity of consciousness ". Hence, re'currence is a form of rational activity, being thus the highest manifestation (because on the plane of rational mind) of an asthetic activity which runs through all Nature and which can be traced through all the levels of evolution, from the unconscious physical plane upwards.] Etudes Critiques. L. Weber, La Pens4e et le Mouve- ment, par Henri Beryson. [A critical review of Bergson's articles collected under this title. More valuable than most of these reviews, in that, after a careful summary of Bergson's views, it formulates some seven points of criticism of which the most important are: a challenge to Bergson's view that the " intellect " models itself upon " matter " which is its proper object; that the practice of intuition, as the only proper method of philo- sophy, can be learnt by everyone and that its results are the same for dif- ferent practitioners; that recent developments in physical and biological theory, in so far as they have been reached by the ordinary methods of science and not by intuition, can be adduced by Bergson as confirmations of his own conclusions, etc. The review concludes with some interesting ob- servations on Bergson's recent arguments for individual survival of death, and the affinity of his speculations in this connection with Spiritualism and Theosophy.] M. Gueroult. L'Odyssee de la Conscience dans la derniPre Philosophie de Schelling, d'apres M. Jankelevitch. [Challenges, as arbitrary and far-fetched, Jankelevitch's attempt to establish a close affinity be- tween the thought of Bergson and that of Schelling in his last phase, and counters by exhibiting in detail the affiliation of Schelling's thought with the movements of thought in his own time. The final verdict is crushing: Jankelevitch's study of Schelling differs from a serious contribution to the History of Philosophy as much as a novelist's romance of the life of some famous person differs from a scientific biography.] Questions Pratiques. A. Ouy. Le Scandale et la Faute. [Defines " scandal " as an action which evokes indignation and surprise by being a spectacular breach of standards or conventions binding on a class or group, by a member of such class or group who had been trusted to uphold and respect them. Such a breach reflects on the whole class: the failure of one member argues the potential liability to failure of all. The act of one lowers the prestige of all: it brings shame and dishonour on the whole group. Hence, a defence reaction on the part of the group: an attempt at all costs (even at the price of letting the offender escape punishment) to avoid publicity, to hush up the scandal, to preserve the good name of the group. But no class has a prerogative of virtue or moral infallibility. Far better to acknowledge and punish a misdeed, even at the expense of a scandal, than shelter a moral lapse behind hypocrisy. The more highly-placed the miscreant, the severer ought to be the punishment. In a democracy, above all, no ill-deeds of high officials should be covered up.] Vari4tes. D. Parodi.

New Books, French and Foreign. Periodicals. No. 2. April, 1935. Ed. Le Roy. Ce que la Microphysique apporte ou suggere a la Philosophie (premier article). [Modern Physics has com- pelled the physicist to re-examine his concepts which is a task essenti- ally philosophical, whilst philosophers cannot avoid scrutinising their own synoptic conclusions in the light of the contemporary evolution in physical theories. This interaction of Physics and Philosophy ap- pears mainly in respect of four problems, the first two of which are dealt with in the present instalment. (1) Physics, thanks to modern astrono- mical researches into far-distant stars, on the one hand, and, on the other, to the exploration of the constitution of the atom, has really become a science on three planes or levels: the " middle " level on which it deals mainly with the physical objects presented to ordinary perception on the surface of the earth; the level on which it deals with the infinitely large and infinitely distant; and the level of the infinitely small. These three planes of physical science reflect a corresponding stratification of the universe, and when we reflect on the widely different techniques of observa- tion and measurement on these three planes, we become aware of a " pluralism " which compels us to ask, at once, whether the concepts de- veloped on the middle plane remain adequate when transferred to one of the other planes; and how the unity of science, corresponding to the unity of the universe, can be re-established. Perhaps each plane requires its " autonomous " concepts, and, if so, the task suggests itself of devising some inclusive concept which will stand to the several concepts of the three planes in the same relation as a variable to three distinct values. (2) The second section of this first instalment of the article pursues this line of thought into detail by showing how the concepts of time, of three-dimen- sional space, and, in general, the apparatus of Newtonian Physics, all of which were developed on the " middle " plane of Physics, break down, or become inadequate, when used on the planes of the very large or the very small. We must, therefore, recognise the limited validity of the concepts of classical Physics. This section contains an exceedingly inter- esting discussion of how the concept of three-dimensional space is developed from our visual and tactual space-perception and our practical behaviour in response to visual and tactual stimuli.] R,. Berthelot L'Astrobiologie et la Pensee de l'Asie: essai sur les origines des sciences et des theories morales (suite). [The sixth instalment of a series of articles begun in 1932. The sub-title of this instalment is: La troisieme Asie: Le monothe'isme islamique et Judaique dans ses rapports avec l'Astrobiologie. Its general thesis is that monotheism, like astrobiology, is an intermediate stage in the development from savage beliefs to modern science. But Islamic monotheism follows a divergent path. Astrobiology and it are " like hostile brothers ", opposed, yet complementary: astrobiology emphasising necessary laws; Islamic monotheism, the incalculable will and power of God, and actually adopting atomism for the purpose of its polemic against necessary law.] J. Devolve. R61e esthgtique de la Recurrence (suite et fin). [Continues the article begun in the previous number by applying the concept of recurrence, as there de- veloped, to a number of standing problems of aesthetic theory, such as the relation of inborn artistic endowment to cultural influences; the nature of the tnsthetic " transposition ", i.e., the imagery used by the artist to express his sesthetic vision; the question of progress in Art; the motif; the</page><page sequence="7">550 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. artistic model and schools of Art (like realism, symbolism, etc.). The article concludes with two final illustrations of the concept of recurrence, viz., Moussorgsky's Boris Goudounow, and Racine's Phedre. Beauty is said to be " the explosion in a particular form of universal being ". Recurrence is described as " that highest activity of the Spirit by which it links the effects of its work of representation with the Eternal Being ". In detail: Every young human being is a poet-not yet divorced from the direct apprehension, and participation in the joy of sheer being, of Nature, by the pressure of economic needs and the sophistication of intellectual analysis. The young human enjoys life as a bird enjoys itself in song, both joys being utterances of the joy in its own being which characterises Reality as such, and which it is the function of " recurrence " to re-capture on the level of consciousness. The artist keeps and expresses this child-like power to enjoy the world, where others lose it and can only find it again through his interpretation of it in his works of art. Again, there can be no " progress " in the essence of this -esthetic enjoyment, which is perfect in all its mani- festations. But there is " progress " in that this -esthetic enjoyment is easier to cultivate in simple cultures, and that it is harder to recapture and communicate it against the adverse pull, and yet also by means of the greater richness, of the resources of an advanced civilisation.] Notes. B. Croce. Action, Succes et Jugement dans le' Vom Kriege ' de Clausewitz. [This famous treatise on the Art of War raises many points of general philosophical interest, e.g., on the relation of theory to practice; on rules and genius (" rules are not opposed to genius . . . the true rule is precisely the way in which the genius acts "); on the historical judgments on the errors of great commanders: can the critic ever put himself adequately at the point of view of the criticised, so as to see the situation with his eyes ? The whole article is a tribute to the philosophical quality of Clausewitz's mind.] E9tudes Critiques. H. Dreyfus=Le Foyer. " Le Parallelisme logico-grammatical ", par Ch. Serrus. [Good analysis and criticism of Serrus' book. An incidental remark, attributed to Duhem, is interesting, viz., that French physicists " seek order through abstraction ", whereas English physicists " are indifferent to the logical development of theories, and incapable of understanding without mechanical models and concrete representations ".] Questions Pratiques. G. Poyer. Population et Pro- gres. [Valuable criticism of Landry's book on La Re'volution de'mographique, in which he calculates that, at the present rate of the restriction of births, the population of Europe will soon diminish and in five generations shrink to so low a level, that the very survival of Western civilisation will be in danger from lack of human beings to sustain it. Poyer argues forcibly against Landry's view that birth-control is simply due to the influence of " rationalisation " and a desire for material " progress " in individual minds. He holds, on the contrary, that large-scale phenomena, like the rapid increase of population in industrialised countries during the nineteenth century, and again the present tendency to birth-restriction in these same countries, must be understood, not solely through their presumed psycho- logical causes operating in the minds of countless individuals taken singly, but through historic and economic causes affecting whole groups and not appreciated in their true character by the mass of individuals at all. E.g., if in the eighteenth century the population of the British Isles increased very slowly, whereas it quadrupled during the nineteenth century in spite of heavy emigration, can we plausibly infer that the nineteenth century British were less rational or less desirous of progress than their eighteenth century ancestors?] Supple'ment.
