<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS ENVIRONMENT, AGRICULTURE AND CONSERVATION Advances in resource management: tributes to W.R. Derrick Sewell. Edited by HAROLD D. FOSTER. London: Belhaven Press, 1993, 336 pp. ?39.50. ISBN 1 85293 292 9 This book is dedicated to the memory of Professor W.R. Derrick Sewell, a leading light in the field of environmental resource management and one of Canada's best known geographers. It takes the form of a collection of 13 papers, contributed by his friends, colleagues and associates. There are really three books rolled into one here. Firstly, it constitutes a moving and impressive tribute to Professor Sewell, charting his prolific and valuable contributions to environmental resource manage- ment. Secondly, it represents an assemblage of the views and recent research of various leading authori- ties in the field. Thirdly, and perhaps most impor- tantly, it is an assessment of the current state, achievements and challenges of a wide variety of environmental resource management issues. A major theme in at least four of the chapters is the water resource, but other contributions focus on recreation, health, forests, meteorological services and the role of geographic information systems. Theory and practice issues are examined via discus- sions of appropriate research methods, data collec- tion problems and public policy debates. The regional spread of the contributions partly fol- lows that of Derrick Sewell's own work, and includes Canada, Australia, the Middle East and Thailand. Inevitably, as with any collection of diverse papers, the treatment of topics is very variable in both breadth and depth. Such heterogeneity can be seen as both a strength and a weakness. This is perhaps not a book for the specialist in a particular field of environmental management. The strength of this volume is that it brings together recent research and achievements in selected areas of environmental resource manage- ment and provides a much needed insight into the opinions and attitudes of leading authorities. According to the Prologue, this book is intended to repay some of the intellectual debt that so many of its authors owe Professor Sewell. It surely succeeds. LOUISE CHITTOCK Economic values and the natural world. By DAVID PEARCE. London: Earthscan, 1993, 129 pp. ?10.95. ISBN 1 85383 152 2 This book continues and amplifies themes developed by Pearce in the two Blueprintsfor a Green Economy. It comprises four principal chapters and a conclusion, together with two substantial appendices, one on environmental policy as a constraint on economic growth, the other on monetary valuation techniques. As such, it is a useful and accessible account of some of the things that environmental economists do. The book is essentially an apologia for an econom- ics of the environment. Pearce recognizes that many environmentalists have fundamental reservations about environmental economics and that some have made little effort to understand how economics may be applied to environmental problems. He argues that economists do not value the environment but rather they value the preferences people have for it. Environmental economics is unashamedly anthro- pocentric (although on page 13 it is described as anthropomorphic) but Pearce claims that this does not prejudice any intrinsic non-monetary value the environment has. This reviewer doubts if Pearce will convince scep- tical environmentalists. The gist of his argument is that economics is morally, ethically and politically neutral. In practice, by using monetary values which have apparent precision and familiarity, economics presents the environment as having solely monetary value. In modem society the idea that economic val- ues are the only values is rife. Part of the crisis of modernism is this very colonisation by economics of the lifeworld and of the natural world. It is revealing that the title of the book uses the term 'natural world' but throughout the book, the less emotive term 'environment' appears. At the heart of the modem project is the domination of nature by the application of science and economics. For many environmentalists, the crisis in relations between humanity and the natural world is that of science and economics. Solutions to it involving yet more of the same fail to address the fundamental problem. So books such as this will never convince deep ecolo- gists. JOHN BRADBEER Conservation in Progress. Edited by F.B. GOLDSMITH and A. WARREN. Chichester: John Wiley and Sons, 1993, 364 pp. ?19.95. ISBN 0 471 93641 3 This is the third book stemming from the work of the Ecology and Conservation Unit at University College London, and edited by Barrie Goldsmith and Andrew Warren. The previous volumes appeared in 1974 and 1983, so nine years seems to be the statutory span for these collections. Does this book match up to the previous ones, which achieved considerable success?
