Bloomington: Indiana Uni- versity Press, 1991. 192 pp. Reading Pictures, Viewing Texts, Professor Gandelman's latest collection of essays on art and literature, is about the "relationship between the visual and the textual and sometimes about the equivalence of the visual and the verbal." It is a difficult book to summarize, being exceedingly dense, given both the variety of topics discussed and their elucidation in terms of diverse critical theories. The pivot of the book is revealed in the optic/haptic dichotomy central to the thought of the nineteenth-century art historian Alois Riegl. Consequently, the essential quality of these essays, one which informs both the subject mat- ter-painting and literature, but also posters and film, caricatures and broad- sheets, maps and the stick figures that have been used to illustrate verbal texts-and the theoretical framework, is visuality. Stemming perhaps from the author's stated intention to avoid ideology and theorizing, the concepts are expressed as iconic signs, thus signaling their optical content. The image connoted both relays and supports the theory to which it is related, while the argument, initially encapsulated in the chapter titles, then amplified in the introduction and retraced through illustrations and diagrams, becomes more clearly visible as each new idea is introduced into the text. While the individual chapters focus on selected aspects of the reader/spec- tator's relationship to specific verbal and visual texts, the book as a whole might be said to reflect what the author terms "the innate structure of vision, the inner body vision we have in our cortex, which directs our gaze when we look at things" (p. xi). The figural support structure underlying this represen- tation covers a time from the period of ancient Egypt through the twentieth century. The approach, however, is synchronic rather than diachronic, with the historical being overlayed by thematic unity, although, as the author points out, historical considerations must inevitably play some part in the ordering of chapters. The value of this kind of approach is that it allows concepts to con- front each other instead of the period with which they are associated, thereby creating conditions in which a metatheoretical dialogue can take place. The subject is introduced by way of the Egyptian, then of the emblem- atic, "hieroglyph," in which the two elements of what will eventually crys-</page><page sequence="2">388 Poetics Today 13:2 tallize into a dichotomy have not yet become polarized and are therefore regarded as coexisting, in conceptual terms, within a single image. In the next chapter, the first unit is abstracted, to be articulated in the gesture of dem- onstration described by the pointing hand, an iconographic device initially encountered in a number of quattrocento paintings, but then recast in later art-historical periods. Ostentation as a sign is seen to parallel the Austinian speech-act model, with constative and performative elements corresponding, respectively, to relationships within and without the picture frame. The ges- ture of demonstration, or rather its verbal equivalent, also serves as a literary strategy, with prime examples being the works of Denis Diderot and Laurence Sterne, where the "pointing" functions in a like manner. Similarly, the concept of liminality, "the aura of the sacred," in W.J.T. Mitchell's terms (see, e.g., The Language of Images, p. 8), is also expressed as a plastic image, or as the space bounded by a series of images, and viewed in relation to a corpus of European paintings produced between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries. In all of these works, liminality is mediated by the door sign, which defines the threshold it outlines and is doubled by the picture frame, thus creating an additional threshold, this time between the spectator and the object of his gaze. Projected onto A.J. Greimas's semiotic square, the logical relations between the various "passage modalities" are then explored in depth. From this process emerge alternative scenarios deriving from a single pictorial narrative, with these relayed as specific qualities, such as obedience, independence, and the like. Conversely, the separation of the verbal from the visual enables the sign to be bracketed with others (such as windows) having a similar semantic content and appearing in literary as well as pictorial contexts. The analysis of Las Meninas occupies a pivotal position in the treatment of doors in painting since this work is seen both to project the sign of liminality, be it the door or mirror, and furthermore, to be a model of "the liminal situation represented by the concept of posing for a painter" (p. 51). Thus, in a sense, Las Meninas is presented as a paradigm of the process of signification. It is at this point that the emphasis of the book shifts from the optic to the haptic and, in effect, from the objective to the subjective. Two key images dominate this second part: one is the cortical homunculus, the other the myth of the flaying of Marysas, both of which are linked in their physiological as- pects to the second term of the dichotomy. Since they provide models "for thinking about all sorts of images-mental, verbal, pictorial, and perceptual," as Mitchell puts it (Iconology, p. 6), these images may be said to function in relation to the total corpus as hypericons. It is these signs which are consid- ered in subsequent chapters, dealing first with visual and verbal maps, whose development is retraced from "anthropomorphic landscapes" to "symbolic cartography," while the following section focuses on the various manifesta- tions of the encorche, conceived essentially as a metaphor for the terribilita of vision. The circuit is completed in the closing chapter with the birth of sight, or at least of its iconic representation, terminating in the death of sight, that is, with its reification and ultimate destruction.
