<plain_text><page sequence="1">Zambian rock paintings D. W. Phillipson The presence of rock paintings in southern Africa has been known to the outside world for three centuries (Ogilby I670: 58I). While the art of the territories south of the Zam- bezi has received considerable attention (Lee and Woodhouse 1970; Willcox 1963 and references), that of Zambia has been less well served: the only major account being that of Clark (I959a). General accounts of African rock paintings (e.g. Cooke 1969) have tended to dismiss the Zambian material in a few derogatory sentences, pointing out its artistic inferiority to that in other areas. The present paper is an attempt to evaluate the Zambian rock paintings not only as art but also as historical evidence, to consider them in the light of current archaeological opinion, and to emphasize the many discoveries which have been made since the publication of Clark's 1959 synthesis. The archaeological background Understanding and evaluation of the Zambian rock paintings can only be attempted against the background of the archaeological sequence. The earliest period to which any of the paintings may reasonably be attributed is the Late Stone Age which began, at least in central and northern Zambia, rather more than 15,ooo years ago (Clark 1970: 174). It is at this time that we first find indications of frequent human settlement of the plateaux, where caves and rock shelters show signs of prolonged occupation, although river- valley and lakeside open sites were also favoured, especially in the south. Zambian Late Stone Age aggregates are predominantly microlithic, lack all traces of pottery and metallurgy, and indicate a hunting-gathering economy in which the tech- niques of food production were unknown. Variations in stone tool typology enable at least three regional groupings to be recognized. Those generally known as the Zambian Wilton and the Nachikufan, found respectively in the Southern Province and on the Central- Northern Province plateau, have been known for some years (Clark I95oa: I07-2I), while a third variant, named after the Makwe rockshelter, has recently been recognized in the east. In each zone a typologically based succession of local developmental stages can be demonstrated. It is at present impossible to say whether the boundaries of these regional types and their sequential stages are definable within close geographical or temporal limits, or whether they are merely the best known modes in a relatively con- tinuous range of variation. It is likewise an open question whether this variation was dependent on the territorial boundaries of socio-political population units or on economic or behavioural factors subject to the local environment.</page><page sequence="2">314 D. W. Phillipson Human skeletal remains recovered from Late Stone Age sites are for the most part of predominantly Khoi-San physical type (Gabel I963). It is against the background of a widespread Late Stone Age population that we must view the appearance of the Zambian Early Iron Age people. Their way of life provides a complete contrast with that of the Late Stone Age; methods of food production, both agriculture and animal domestication, were introduced, as were the techniques of metal- lurgy, pottery and the construction of pole and daga houses. Settled life in established villages thus made its first appearance on the Zambian scene at this time. Although it is not known whether the introductions of these new techniques were precisely concurrent, it is clear that their arrival was intimately connected with major population movements and coincided with the arrival of negroid people who probably spoke Bantu languages. At least seven regional groups may now be recognized within the Zambian Early Iron Age. They appear to have entered the country at roughly the same time from a primary or, more probably, secondary centre of dispersal somewhere in what is now the Zaire Republic, and to have been discrete cultural entities prior to their establishment in Zambia. These events took place around the second or third centuries A.D. (Phillipson 1968, i969a). The Early Iron Age populations of the Kalambo group in northern Zambia and of the Kamnama group in the east both appear to have been sparse, and the majority of the people in these areas probably retained their Late Stone Age way of life well into the present millennium. The Copperbelt, on the other hand, was much more densely popu- lated by the farming peoples of the Chondwe group and exploitation of the copper de- posits dates from about the middle of the first millennium A.D. The Kapwirimbwe group settlers of the Lusaka region were firmly established at an early date, but it is only in the Southern Province that the Early Iron Age population of the Kalundu and Dambwa groups appears to have been dense enough largely to displace the Late Stone Age hunters, who survived in other areas until a very few centuries ago. People of San physical type, who have incompletely adopted an Iron Age way of life, still survive in the extreme south-west of Zambia (Clark 195I). At about the beginning of the second millennium A.D., the first settlements appeared of the later Iron Age people who seem, archaeologically speaking, to be directly ancestral to many sections of the present Zambian population. On the Copperbelt and around Lusaka, the later Iron Age was established by the twelfth century, and a similar date seems probable over most of the eastern half of Zambia (Phillipson 1970). It was among these people that immigrant groups later established the states and kingdoms whose history is preserved in the traditions of many Zambian peoples. Little archaeological research has been done on this period, and the later Iron Age, beyond the range of oral tradition, is at present less well understood than the Early Iron Age (Phillipson 1972a). In the Southern Province, the Early Iron Age was displaced somewhat earlier than was the case further north, and the 'Kalomo culture', whose relationship with other archaeological communities is so far imperfectly understood, was established by the eighth century. Here again, a population ancestral to the modern inhabitants of the area was present by early in the present millennium but remained largely distinct, in material culture and in political development, from contemporary societies north of the Kafue (Fagan and Phillipson 1964; Vogel 1971).</page><page sequence="3">Zambian rock paintings 315 The later Iron Age archaeology of western Zambia remains almost completely un- known, but there are indications of greater cultural continuity from the Early Iron Age into more recent times than is the case elsewhere (Phillipson 1971). It will be clear from the foregoing summary that recent Zambian prehistory has seen three major cultural episodes between which there has been considerable chronological overlap. In many areas of the country, Late Stone Age communities appear to have preserved their traditional way of life with minimal contact with Early Iron Age people, until after the replacement of the latter by later Iron Age societies. It is against the back- cloth of this heterogenous population that we must view the rock paintings. The paintings The rock paintings of Central Africa may be divided into two basic stylistic categories: naturalistic representations and schematic designs (Clark I959a: I70). As far as Zambia is concerned, the most frequent naturalistic motifs are simple monochrome paintings of antelope, other animals and human figures being comparatively rare. Linear motifs, including grids and ladder designs, and patterns of finger-dots are common in the sche- matic group. Comparable schematic paintings also occur in Tanzania (Fosbrooke i950: passim), Malawi (Clark I959a: 202-7) and in parts of Mo9ambique (dos Santos 1955). They are likewise found widely distributed in Rhodesia (Cooke I959: 133; I969: 40-2) and in parts of South Africa (Clark I958a; Rudner and Rudner I968), but there the frequency of fine naturalistic paintings has tended to draw the attention of archaeologists away from the schematic designs which consequently remain little known (e.g. Willcox I963; Lee and Woodhouse 1970). In Zambia, Clark (I959a: 207-8) has noted the tendency, where a sequence can be established, for the naturalistic paintings to predate the schematic. Few sites contain sufficient paintings to enable local stylistic sequences to be built up on the basis of super- impositions. The majority occur under small overhangs or in shelters where there are few motifs and no superimpositions. For this reason, conclusions as to the sequence and authorship of the paintings are necessarily tentative. Northern region It is in the north that the greatest concentration of paintings has come to light, and, as it was here that a stylistic sequence was first elucidated, the area forms a convenient starting point for this survey. The earliest paintings appear to be naturalistic representations of animals or, less frequently, human figures. Both occur at Nachikufu Cave (fig. 24), in Mpika District, the type-site of the Nachikufan variant of the Late Stone Age (Clark I95ob; I959a: I72-9I). The black monochrome naturalistic paintings include two elephant, a tiny and comparatively well executed figure of an antelope, and a series of stylized human figures, some of which are armed with bows and one, apparently, with a spear. Although there are no direct superimpositions, the low position of the naturalistic paintings, together with their weathered condition despite their sheltered situation, renders it probable that they are the earliest paintings at the site.</page><page sequence="4">Mwela tSomena Co r . i ) I 100 200 300 L???- I?? a^KM KM Figure 24 Map of Zambia showing location of rock painting sites mentioned in the text</page><page sequence="5">Zambian rock paintings 3I7 The next style at Nachikufu appears to be a red schematic series, best represented by an elaborate grid-like motif in a small rockshelter above the main cave, and by a series of small rectangular grids with vertical subdivisions, one of which is overlain by a large oval splotch of orange paint. Still more recent is a group of designs in thick greasy white paint. The clearest figures are two crudely-drawn elongated quadrupeds, which may be either mammalian or reptilian, and two representations of metal tools. An Iron Age date for this series is thus indicated, whether or not it is the work of Iron Age people. Confirmation and elaboration of the Nachikufu sequence comes from sites in Serenje District, further to the south (Phillipson I969b). At Nakapapula rockshelter, naturalistic art is represented by a reddish-purple animal figure in the so-called 'Nachitalo style', where the body is represented by a crescentic block of paint, the limbs, tail and head being only cursorily indicated. This is overpainted by red schematic motifs in which, as at Nachikufu, grid designs are overlain by bold dots and oval splotches. Nakapapula also provides evidence for the absolute age of the schematic paintings. Part of the rock face is obscured by a stack of fallen rocks, around which schematic paintings extend almost to floor level. It is clear that the schematic paintings were executed after the rock-fall which took place during the second half of the first millennium A.D. (GX-767) when both Late Stone Age (Nachikufan) and Early Iron Age (Kalambo group) peoples were present in the area (Phillipson I969b: I95). Not far to the north of Nakapapula is the large cave of Nsalu, which contains the richest concentration of schematic paintings so far discovered in Zambia (Clark I959a: I79-85). The earliest designs are a series of fine scribblings done by using a piece of dry yellow-brown pigment as a crayon. Contemporary, or later, are a large number of yellow schematic paintings which occur above and below a broad yellow band which runs hori- zontally around the wall at a height of about four metres. These include grids, parallel lines, ladders, concentric circles and elongated loops. The next oldest series, overlying the yellow, is in red and is characterized by finger drawings of parallel lines, several forms of grid, and two large, parallel loops forming a 'bridge' motif. Overlying the red paintings are bichrome designs in red and white, including white concentric circles with internal radiating lines, their interstices filled in with red. The latest paintings in the cave, in a thick grey/white pigment, include sun motifs and anthropomorphic designs. Nsalu thus provides a detailed local subdivision of the schematic art series, and confirms that the greasy white designs represent the final stage in the rock painting sequence. Rock paintings are widely scattered over much of the Northern Province, but by far the richest concentration is in the area of the Mwela Rocks, east of Kasama. The presence of rock paintings at Mwela has been known for the past twenty years (Clark 1959a: I78), but it is only recently that Miss Elizabeth Hodgkin and the pupils of Kasama Girls' Secondary School have been able to demonstrate the full richness of the area. In less than Ioo square kilometres, about zoo rock painting sites are now known and many more probably remain to be discovered. The Mwela Rocks comprise a region of huge boulders and fragmented rocky outcrops which afford innumerable small overhangs protecting surfaces ideal for painting, although large rockshelters suitable for prolonged human occupation are rare. The scarcity of large painting surfaces means that many sites have only single motifs. Superimpositions are therefore few, and the establishment of a</page><page sequence="6">3 8 D. W. Phillipson stylistic sequence is correspondingly difficult. As recording of the Mwela paintings is far from complete, the following account must be regarded as preliminary. The Mwela Rocks area is remarkable for the number and variety of its naturalistic paintings. With few exceptions they are done in flat monochrome in various shades from red to purple. 'Nachitalo style' animal figures are frequent. Other paintings are more delicate and well proportioned, and it is possible to suggest that these small figures include representations of antelope and of a jackal, or dog, although rarely are diagnostic characteristics sufficiently clear for certainty. An exception is a small, lively figure of a warthog, with its erect tufted tail clearly shown. Noteworthy also is a panel showing five animals with either long horns or large, erect ears. Heads, tails and legs are represented at an appropriate scale but with no effort to achieve individuality. On this panel the animal paintings are overlain by schematic designs of finger dots. In other instances, rows of dots have been painted around animal figures and, although the relative fading of the two motifs generally indicates that the dots are later, the association appears inten- tional. Stylized human figures are also found. Two groups of naturalistic paintings call for special comment, as they are the only compositions showing the clear interaction of several naturalistic figures which have so far been discovered in the Zambian rock art series. The first of these represents a hunting scene centred on a faded red quadruped of 'Nachitalo' type, whose head and limbs are grossly under-emphasized. Encircling the animal is a line of fifty-six small, stylized, reddish-purple human figures, three of which, depicted upside-down below the hind legs of the animal, may perhaps be interpreted as fatalities of the hunt. A very faint pale-yellow saurian figure, also enclosed by the line of hunters, probably predates the main composition. The second group composition, from the nearby Somena Rocks, is executed in an unusually powerful manner, somewhat simple and stylized. It depicts a lioness standing over a supine bovid, while a human figure stands nearby levelling a long object, perhaps a spear, at the head of the lioness (plate 32). The bovid is incompletely represented, only one limb being shown: its stance and the fact that it is depicted upside-down probably indicate that it is dead. The shape of its horns, portrayed in twisted perspective, suggests that it may be a domestic ox. It is interesting to note that here, too, the human figure is much more highly stylized than are the animals. Most of the paintings at Mwela Rocks are schematic and include a wide variety of styles and motifs. Some designs are clearly representational, but it is doubtful whether there are sufficient grounds for separating them from the main schematic group. Note- worthy among these is a small grid design which extends upwards from the stylized figure of a bird and which Walton (1958) has suggested may represent a bird caught in a trap. Other motifs which may be representational are rare anthropomorphic figures and rectangular blocks with projections at the corners, resembling hides stretched out to dry. Of the fully schematic motifs the great majority are in red paint: the others are in a yellow-orange. The latter are exclusively linear, and concentric circles predominate. There appear to be no finger dot designs in yellow, although these are the commonest of the red schematic motifs. The yellow paintings are generally faint and, although this may be due to a more fugitive nature of the pigment, it is tempting to suggest, in the absence</page><page sequence="7">Zambian rock paintings 319 of superimpositions, that the yellow schematics may antedate the red ones, as is the case at Nsalu. The schematic paintings at Mwela have such variety that it is difficult to present an adequate description without resorting to a catalogue. Probably the most frequent designs are those consisting of finger dots, and the number of superimposed examples in differing degrees of fading suggests that these continued to be executed over a long period. Finger dots usually occur evenly spaced in lines, often composed of two or three parallel rows of dots. In several cases the dots were clearly applied with three fingers held in a fixed position, the resultant designs bearing a strong resemblance to cat spoor. Designs of fine dots, presumably made with a stick or brush, are also found. Ladder designs, ranging from small neat examples to roughly executed motifs crossing a whole rock face, occur in great variety. Grids of other types are comparatively uncommon but include some large complex examples with both horizontal and vertical subdivisions. Concentric circles also occur and may occupy an early position in the sequence, for they are generally badly faded. More unusual motifs include large panels of swirling and looped lines and a many-branched leaf-like design in the execution of which the artist has made remarkable use of the natural configuration of the rock, the painted surface being divided into two parts by a deep horizontal crack, while the design on the lower half is an almost exact mirror image of that on the upper. White designs are virtually absent from Mwela Rocks. Copperbelt region The rock paintings of the Copperbelt share many features with those of the northern area. They are sparsely distributed in the area stretching south from the eastern end of the Zaire pedicle as far south as Kapiri Mposhi and Fiwila. The paintings at several sites around Nachitalo Hill, in the extreme west of Mkushi District, are the most varied, and include the only naturalistic paintings known from this area (Clark I959a: I72-88). There are traces of at least twelve purple quadrupeds with crescentic bodies and with the limbs, head and tail under-emphasized. At least four of the animals are overlain by lines and dots in red paint, clearly belonging to the schematic art group which here, as elsewhere, post-dates the naturalistic figures. The earliest schematic paintings at Nachitalo are in faded yellow-orange. The motifs comprise groups of parallel lines, often associated with dots, as well as simple large grids, and are overlain by schematic designs in red. The motifs in the latter series are similar but include smaller, neater and more complex grids. The latest paintings are in deep red- dish-purple, and include bold designs of lines and dots as well as a large comet-like motif with a long horizontal tail. It is to the red schematic group that the other rock paintings in the Copperbelt area all belong. Almost all consist of isolated motifs, mostly large open grids, boldly but apparently carelessly executed (Phillipson x97zb). Superimpositions are lacking, and in the absence of further evidence it must be assumed that the sequence demonstrated for Nachitalo is characteristic. FA</page><page sequence="8">320 D. W. Phillipson Southern region In the Southern Province paintable rock surfaces are almost unknown and the only painted site so far discovered is at Sikaunda Hill, near Kalomo. Here are poorly- preserved red schematic designs comprising a ladder motif, traces of circles and linear patterns of alternating dots and short dashes. Eastern region Discussion of the rock painting sequence in eastern Zambia has been left until last, both because it shows significant differences from that described for the rest of the country, and because it appears that here the rock painting tradition has continued into more recent times than was the case elsewhere. Sites are concentrated in the plateau country of Chipata, Chadiza and Katete Districts, and are thus separated from the regions described above by the Luangwa valley and its formidable escarpments. Zambia's borders enclose but a small part of this art zone, which extends into Malawi and Mo9ambique. In the east there are only two sites known with naturalistic paintings. These are Zawi Hill and Katolola, both in Chipata District. At the former site are faded red naturalistic paintings, including a small neat antelope, probably an eland, delicately and accurately outlined and filled in with a mass of lines so dense in the forepart as to give the initial impression of a solid block of colour. The head, horns and tail are neatly indicated but the legs are somewhat under-emphasized. This painting exhibits a greater degree of natural- ism than any so far discovered west of the Luangwa. Nearby is a series of well-preserved red schematic paintings which appear more recent. These include several small neat grids with vertical subdivisions, as well as loops and isolated lines. Overlying the red paintings are delicate designs in white, including rows of fine parallel lines, neat chequer- board grids and patterns of fine dots (Clark, i959a: I7i). At Katolola are two separate painted sites. One bears a large figure of an eland sketched in thin purple lines. Although rougher and coarser, the style is clearly related to that at Zawi. The dewlap and mane are clearly indicated, but the legs are disproportionately small. Of particular interest is the fact that the eland has been painted over a large schematic grid (Clark I959a: 170). Katolola is thus the first site to be discovered in Zambia where there is clear superimposition of a naturalistic painting over a schematic one. The implications of this are discussed below. On a nearby rock face are elaborate red schematic motifs, including large and carefully- executed groups of concentric circles and grids. From one grid emerge two horizontal ladder motifs below which are dots of red paint forming a design resembling rain falling from a cloud (fig. 25). The whole rock face is pitted with scars, caused by stones being thrown at the paintings. Patination shows that the scars are ancient. Cooke (I964) has described a site near Gwanda, in Rhodesia, where the throwing of stones at rock paint- ings forms a part of traditional rain-making ceremonies, and, in view of the design at Katolola, this may be the explanation of the stone-throwing at that site also. The red schematic grids of the type overlain by the Katolola eland have a wide distribution in the Eastern Province, but are a less predominant part of the total range of local rock art styles than are their counterparts in other parts of the country. That such</page><page sequence="9">Zambian rock paintings 321 I METRE IV Figure 25 Red schematic paintings at Katolola grids continued to be painted for some time is, however, shown at Makwe, near Katete, where several superimposed grids occur in differing states of preservation. Also at Makwe is a group of red, vaguely anthropomorphic paintings which are closely comparable to those from Mwela Rocks. The widest range of schematic paintings occurs at Sakwe, near Chadiza, where the oldest grids are overlain by zoomorphic motifs in red outline, which are in turn covered by further grids, some of which are unusually complex and angular. The contemporaneity of grids and outline zoomorphic figures is confirmed at Chafisi and at sites near Rukuzye Dam, Chipata (Phillipson i966: 73). Several sites in this region display large series of white paintings which can once more be shown to occupy the most recent position in the sequence. At Chaingo, north-east of Katete, an elaborate and badly-faded red grid is overlain by a large zoomorphic figure of which the white outline has been filled with finger dots in the same white paint, producing a design resembling a leopard skin. This figure is clearly derived from the red outline zoomorphs of Sakwe, Chafisi and Rukuzye. Representations of hoes and axes, done in the same paint and presumably contemporary with the main zoomorphic figure, further fcf^ 1 I~~lo same paint and presumably contemporary with the main zoomorphic figure, further</page><page sequence="10">322 D. W. Phillipson demonstrate the late Iron Age date of the white paintings at Chaingo (Chaplin I962: 8). Just as the red and white bichrome series of paintings at Nsalu indicates a transitional stage and some degree of continuity between the red schematics and the late white style, so in the east a similar link can be demonstrated, on somewhat stronger evidence. Here, there is continuity in subject matter as well as in colour, pigment type and technique. The presence of schematic grids in thick white paint has already been noted at Zawi: other examples occur at Simbo Hill, Petauke, where there are also paintings of metal tools which local inhabitants say were painted by their own ancestors at the time of the Ngoni wars in the nineteenth century (Clark 1959: i98; Phillipson i966: 79). A con- nection between the red outline zoomorphs such as those at Sakwe, and the white 'leo- pard' at Chaingo has already been suggested, and confirmation is available in the form of paintings typologically intermediate. At Thandwe and Manje, in Chipata, and at Kavumo in Chadiza, are bichrome zoomorphic designs, each comprising a red outline almost identical to the examples at Sakwe which is only two kilometres from Kavumo. The outlines are filled with thick, greasy buff-white paint, and over-painting of red on buff and buff on red on different parts of the same figure at Thandwe shows that the painting was originally executed as a bichrome, and was not produced by the buff infilling of an earlier red outline. A rectangle filled with finger dots, both done in red paint but using the same techniques as were employed for the 'leopard' at Chaingo, is found at Rukuzye (Phillipson I966: 76). Bichrome grids and other schematic designs, done in dark purple and white paint, occur at Mkoma, east of Katete (Chaplin I962: io). Mkoma also con- tains an extensive series of white paintings, including anthropomorphic and zoomorphic designs and representations of metal tools. The transition from the red schematics to the late white paintings may thus be seen as a gradual process which took place over a wide area of the Eastern Province. The late white paintings occur in great variety and many of the most striking and impressive paintings belong to this style. At Kalemba, in Chadiza District, is a frieze of white paintings over twelve metres in length, beneath which are faint traces of red schematics. The white motifs are predominantly anthropomorphic, but stylized figures of quadrupeds, some probably representing long-horned cattle, and schematic motifs also occur. The bichrome zoomorphic paintings at Thandwe have already been described. They are overlain by a series of white paintings, including representations of hoes and what appear to be pictures of grain bins. On a second rock face in the same rockshelter is a large series of white paintings. The earliest is a large, slightly faded 'leopard' motif which is remarkably similar to that from Chaingo but without the outline. This is over- lain by a series of designs in a brighter white paint, including a much cruder version of the same 'leopard' motif, and three elaborate circular designs (plate 33). Local people state that these designs have a sexual significance and that they were painted in con- nection with the puberty ceremonies of Nsenga girls. Very similar designs are still made on the ground, usually with mealie meal, at such ceremonies, and have been described by Apthorpe (I962). The very recent date of these white paintings at Thandwe is con- firmed by the presence, overlying the earlier 'leopard', of a representation of a motor car, associated with a crude anthropomorphic figure. There can thus be no doubt that, at this site at least, the rock art tradition has continued into the present century.</page><page sequence="11">Zambian rock paintings 323 The date and significance of the rock paintings The correlation has often been made between the distribution of the largely schematic Zambian rock paintings and that of the Nachikufan Late Stone Age industries (e.g. Clark I959a: 210-11). Such a theory is no longer tenable for several reasons. Firstly, schematic paintings are very common east of the Luangwa River where the Late Stone Age, as recovered at Kalemba and Makwe which themselves contain schematic paintings, is not of Nachikufan type (Phillipson forthcoming). Secondly, schematic paintings also occur at Sikaunda Hill in the Southern Province, an area where the Late Stone Age is of 'Wilton' type. The industries of the Copperbelt, where schematic paintings are also found, are almost certainly much more closely related to the 'Wilton' than they are to the Nachikufan (Gabel 1967; Phillipson and Phillipson I970: 54), although the small assemblage from the Chifubwa Stream rockshelter, 200 kilometres west of the Copper- belt, has been described as comparable to Nachikufan (Clark I958b). Furthermore, this theory does not provide an adequate explanation for the clear division of the paintings into naturalistic and schematic classes, both of which are very widely distributed throughout the Nachikufan area. Within this area the schematic paintings can be divided into several regional styles, some of which extend into 'Wilton' areas. There is thus little reason to attribute the schematic art to any particular Late Stone Age group. A number of excavations in northern and eastern Zambia show that these regions were inhabited for most of the first millennium A.D., and often later both by Early Iron Age and by Late Stone Age groups. A similar situation must have prevailed in parts of Rhodesia, where Cooke (I963) has convincingly argued that the great majority of the naturalistic art is the work of Late Stone Age peoples who sometimes, in the later stages of the painting sequence, depicted their Iron Age neighbours. A similar Late Stone Age attribution of the Zambian naturalistic paintings is in keeping with the available evidence. Different naturalistic styles occur on the eastern and western sides of the Luangwa valley, and the Late Stone Age industries of these areas have also been shown to be typologically distinct. Two basic interpretations have been placed on the naturalistic rock art of eastern and southern Africa. The first holds that the frequent representation of game animals and hunting scenes is connected with a concept of sympathetic magic, where it is believed that the representation of an animal will give the hunter/artist power over that animal, or that the portrayal of a gravid beast will increase the fecundity of the herds (Clark I959b: 268). Such a belief, which one can imagine would be accompanied by restrictions or taboos regarding the painting of humans, would help to explain the rarity of human beings in the subject matter of the art and the fact that people, when included, are much more stylized than the associated animal figures. A second view holds that the natural- istic paintings are predominantly art for art's sake, executed mainly for the pleasure brought to artist and viewer (Cooke I969: 1I48). It is true that a higher proportion of the naturalistic paintings than of the schematics seems to be done on the walls of the larger, more habitable, rockshelters; but there remains a substantial minority painted in in- accessible places. The Zambian evidence is insufficient to enable us to reach a preference between these two viewpoints, but it should be noted that the theories are not necessarily so mutually exclusive as their proponents suggest.</page><page sequence="12">324 D. W. Phillipson There is a clear stylistic break between the naturalistic art and the schematic, yet the chronological distinction between them is less well defined. At the majority of sites throughout Zambia, where the two styles occur together, the naturalistic paintings are demonstrably earlier. That this was not invariably the case is shown by the super- imposition of a naturalistic painting over a schematic grid at Katolola. Other possible examples of naturalistic paintings post-dating schematics are known from Mwela Rocks. If the naturalistic art, like its counterparts in Rhodesia and elsewhere, is to be attributed to Late Stone Age people, then the apparent contemporaneity of the two distinct painting traditions is explained as the work of Late Stone Age and Iron Age people living synchronously in the same area. The schematic art is more enigmatic. Its quantity and the evidence for a similar sequence over a wide area suggests that it continued to be executed for a substantial period. Both east and west of the Luangwa, there can be distinguished a grading or gradual transition from the initially red schematic art to the late white group. In both areas the late white paintings include representations of metal tools. In the east, it has been demonstrated that the tradition of the white paintings continued into the present century, and that it is sometimes linked with initiation ceremonies practised by the present inhabitants of the area. The latest paintings must therefore be the work of Iron Age peoples. The apparent continuity of this painting tradition with the schematic art may be taken as suggesting that the latter is also of Iron Age origin. The evidence of a date within the last i,0o0-I,200 years for the schematic paintings at Nakapapula, the only site which has so far produced archaeological evidence for the date of the schematic art, is in keeping with this hypothesis. It should be noted that all the painted rockshelters so far excavated in Zambia have yielded Early Iron Age pottery in association with the stone industry. Early Iron Age sites are known from all areas where schematic rock paintings occur, and the regional variants in the art show some correlation with those observed in the Early Iron Age industries. For example, the schematic paintings of the Copperbelt area, formerly in- habited by Early Iron Age peoples of the Chondwe group, are done on a large scale and incorporate boldly-drawn intersecting lines with little apparent standardization of motif. To the north-east, the paintings tend to be smaller and neater, including many simple grid designs and, centred around Kasama, arrangements of finger-dots. The Early Iron Age industries of this region are distinct from those of the Copperbelt, and have been informally referred to as the Kalambo group (Phillipson I968: 197). There are indications of yet another Early Iron Age variant in the Eastern Province, and here again the sche- matic paintings are of distinct type, characterized by large and complex grid designs and an absence of finger-dot motifs. The distribution of these art variants correlates much more closely with that of the Early Iron Age industries than with those of the Late Stone Age. Despite the regular occurrence of Iron Age artefacts, particularly pottery, in the higher levels of the rockshelter deposits, these are almost invariably intimately associated with Late Stone Age material, and it does not appear that Iron Age people have ever inhabited rockshelters except for limited periods when they were used as refuges in time of war. It is in such circumstances that the white paintings at Simbo Hill are said to have been executed. Rockshelters are, however, known to be used temporarily by Iron Age peoples</page><page sequence="13">Zambian rock paintings 325 for initiation and other ceremonies. There is a considerable volume of evidence to associate many of the late white paintings of the Eastern Province with such ceremonies. The sexual significance of the circular designs at Thandwe has already been mentioned. The various zoomorphic designs of the white painting group and the earlier bichromatic series also have close parallels in the traditional ceremonies of the present population. Chaplin and Apthorpe (1962) have drawn attention to the close similarity between spotted figures of the genet, made and used in girls' puberty ceremonies by the Nsenga of the Petauke area, and the spotted 'leopard' painting at Chaingo. There are also many other parallels between the zoomorphic paintings and the inyago (male initiation) figures of the Malawian Yao (Stannus I922; Stannus and Davey 19I3). In view of the continuous development which can be demonstrated between the red schematic art and the late white paintings, it seems reasonable to suppose that the former may also be connected in some way with the religious and social practices of the earlier Iron Age populations. Such a suggestion is in keeping with the occurrence of much of this art under small inaccessible overhangs where little shelter, much less room for regular settlement, is available. A tentative connection between the Katolola schematic paintings and rain-making ceremonies has been suggested above. Although modern villagers almost invariably express ignorance of the authorship or meaning of the red paintings, there is evidence that their original significance is remembered in some areas. Chaplin records how one of the zoomorphic outline figures at Sakwe had been filled with clay shortly before his visit in I958. Other Sakwe paintings have recently been badly scratched, and it is said that this was done by people in search of medicine. Schematic paintings occur in the Northern Province in rockshelters which are still held sacred. Evidence in a similar vein has been recorded in East Africa (e.g. Culwick 193 I). Whether the schematic art is a development or modification of the naturalistic, or whether it has an independent origin, is not yet clear. However, the evidence at present available does suggest that the naturalistic and schematic traditions in Zambian rock paintings may best be considered as belonging to two distinct socio-economic groups; the generally earlier naturalistic representations being the work of Late Stone Age hunter- gatherers, while the art of their food-producing Iron Age contemporaries and successors took the form of a schematic tradition which has continued, in modified form, into very recent times. 27.vii.I971 Zambia National Monuments Commission, Livingstone, Zambia References Apthorpe, R.

Abstract Phillipson, D. W. Zambian rock paintings Zambian rock painting sites are described and evaluated, emphasis being placed on recently discovered material and on evidence for the establishment of regional stylistic sequences. Rare naturalistic paintings, which are concentrated in the northern region, are attributed, like their counterparts elsewhere in southern and central Africa, to the Late Stone Age. The later sequence of schematic styles, between which and the naturalistic paintings some chronological overlap can be demonstrated, is attributed to the Iron Age, and evidence is quoted to link many examples with religious and social ceremonies. The schematic art developed, particularly in the east, into a group of crude white paintings whose execution has continued into recent times.</page></plain_text>
