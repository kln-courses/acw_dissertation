Annie Proulx, traces the life of and routes travelled by a green diatonic button accordion: its birth in Sicily in the  workshop of “Th e Accordion Maker,” its numerous changes of ownership in the  Americas during encounters between various immigrant communities, and its  death when it fi nally falls into disrepair in the town of Old Glory, Minnesota.  Th ere are other accordions in the book, and many temporary human owners,  but it is one particular green accordion that is the book’s protagonist. We meet  and experience other characters largely through their interactions with the green  accordion, a character whose voice, we learn, “sounded hoarse and crying, re- minding listeners of the brutalities of love, of various hungers” (Proulx 1996:22).  Th is green accordion is not only central to human social networks, but is also  itself an actor with agency. Seeing the extent to which Proulx’s human characters  succumb to ill fate (while the accordion lives on), it would not be a stretch to  suggest that the green accordion was one of the only characters with agency.  A similar plot surrounds the protagonist of François Girard’s movie Th e  Red Violin (1998). In this story, the violin-maker Nicolò is about to varnish a  violin he considers to be his best yet, when he learns that his wife Anna has died  while giving birth to what would have been their fi rst child. He mixes Anna’s  blood in with the varnish, donates the instrument to an orphanage, and never  makes another violin again. Th e red violin, a fi ctional instrument inspired by  Stradivari’s 1721 “Red Mendelssohn,” travels to Vienna, England, China and  fi nally Canada, cultivating fatal host-parasitic relations with each violinist that  it possesses, while motivating other individuals to steal it, sell it, or otherwise  turn to morally evil behavior.  Th e Red Violin was not the fi rst fi ctional account of a Stradivari violin  capable of travel and the occult; J. Meade Falkner’s novel Th e Lost Stradivarius  (1895) features a fi ne Stradivarius which calls up the ghost of its original owner  as it travels from England to Italy.

In the penultimate scene, the possession  complete, our protagonist recounts: As I opened my bedroom door the violin ceased suddenly in the middle of a bar.  Its last sound was not a musical note, but rather a horrible scream, such as I pray I  may never hear again. It was a sound such as a wounded beast might utter. (Falkner  1895:chapter 15).  I draw on these literary and fi ctional examples from North American  and Western European literature to demonstrate the ease with which we can  conceive of musical instruments as not only having some degree of agency, but  even as protagonists of stories—as actors who facilitate, prevent, or mediate  social interaction among other characters.1 In none of these stories is the violin  or accordion symbolic, nor is the instrument unambiguously a metaphor or  parable for obsession, evil, jealousy, or other problematic moral-emotional  states. Let us not overlook the fact that the accordion and the two Stradi- vari stumble into social worlds that are preconstituted as sites of confl ict and  moral corruption. Furthermore, the instrument-maker, in these three stories,  is not an evil magician who uses the instrument to manipulate other humans.  Th e instrument is not the maker’s doppelgänger, but instead more akin to the  maker’s golem, albeit a golem that works not through direct violence but rather  by creating desire and aff ect through soundings.2 Yet, only some instruments  seem to possess a golem-like autonomy. Guitars seem to have a propensity to  teach their owners how to play them,3 gods live in or are channeled through  certain instruments, and other instruments such as the Anatolian saz (which  I will explore, along with Central Asian long-necked lutes, later in this essay)  mediate interpersonal disputes in communities. Still other instruments seem  (at least as far as we know) to have little agency.  In this article, I argue for taking objects, and particularly musical instru- ments, seriously—but not simply as things that humans use or make or exchange,  or as passive artifacts from which sound emanates. Much of the power, mystique,  and allure of musical instruments, I argue, is inextricable from the myriad situ- ations where instruments are entangled in webs of complex relationships—be- tween humans and objects, between humans and humans, and between objects  and other objects. Even the same instrument, in diff erent sociohistorical contexts,  may be implicated in categorically diff erent kinds of relations. I thus am arguing  for the study of the social life of musical instruments. ETM 56_3 text.indd   364 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> Bates: Social Life of Musical Instruments   Organology  Mention organology to an ethnomusicology student, and what probably  fi rst comes to mind are museums, the Hornbostel-Sachs classifi cation system,  and perhaps (depending on the university program) a seemingly outdated class  on measuring and documenting physical objects. Th is is not surprising: such  legacies abound in many organology courses, scholarly articles, and institu- tions such as the Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) in Phoenix, Arizona.  Instrument museums are mausoleums, places for the display of the musically  dead, with organologists acting as morticians, preparing dead instrument  bodies for preservation and display. Visitors to MIM walk by a glass display  case containing a Turkish saz and hear a commercially available recording of  saz music through their FM-equipped headsets. Yet, the display (like many  displays in the museum) reads simply “Saz. Turkey. Long-necked lute,” bereft   of stories about the particular instrument, how it came to be in the museum,  or its pre-death life in the hands of living players.4 Instruments may be central  to curatorial work, but it is a diff erent sort of organology that I have in mind.  Th e lengthiest chapter of Th e Ethnomusicologist suggests a symbolic clas- sifi cation for musical instruments. Ki Mantle Hood was attracted to the Horn- bostel-Sachs system (1961) and preceding Mahillon system (1880) that was itself  derived from the Natyasastra Sanskrit treatise, but found many of these systems’  particular subdivisional choices to be arbitrary or inconsistent. He also believed  that a classifi cation system needed to take account of details such as the musical  soundings and social function of the instrument, and developed the organogram  as an experimental symbolic representation. To get a sense of Hood’s ambitions,  let’s consider one of the few organograms that he details in full. Th e notation indicates that the atumpan has the external and internal shape of a  bowl opening into a cylinder made of (5) wood, has a single head fastened by a  H(oop) R(ing) and is played with two crooked sticks, is used in pairs (the pair is  called atumpan), is tuned by W(etting) the heads and by means of tuning pegs,  supporting V lacing, to a R(elative) pitch of H(igh) and L(ow). Th e drums are held  in a slanting position by a stand. Th e pair has the following Hardness Scale ratings:  Loudness, 8; Pitch, 3; Quality, 4; Density, 7–9; Technique, 4; Finish, 1; Motif, 4. Th ey  are associated with a G(roup) of H(igh) social status that values them at 10, they  S(ymbolize) the soul of ancestor drummers and a tree, are honored with L(ibations),  have magic P(ower), and R(itual) is involved in their manufacture and when they  are played. S(ociety) values them at 10, the P(layer) values them at 10, the M(aker)  of the drums is accorded a special S(tatus), their M(onetary) value is 8, they are  indispensable in the life C(ycle) of man. (Hood 1982:155–6)  In addition to construction details and considerations of the interface (how  performers play, tune, or otherwise modify the drum’s soundings), Hood’s or- ETM 56_3 text.indd   365 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="4">   Ethnomusicology, Fall 2012 Figure 1. Mantle Hood’s  organogram for Ghanean  atumpan drums. ganograms show concern for ornamentational details (fi nish or motif), instru- mental soundings (loudness, pitch, and quality), and basic aspects of the instru- ment’s relationships to individuals and to society. While richer than preceding  classifi catory systems, Hood’s organograms don’t convey the dynamic and vari- able nature of personal and societal relations with instruments, and the incon- sistent depth of his accompanying narratives ultimately results in a somewhat  incoherent concept of the instrument-object (following on Ian Woodward’s  insistence that “it is stories and narratives that hold an object together, giving  it cultural meaning” [2009:60]). Organograms may have been relegated to the  dustbin of ethnomusicological history, but I do wish to underscore that at the  very least the creation of an organogram required contextual information that  could only come via ethnography.5  Outside of organology journals,6 perhaps the last signifi cant plea for a  broader study of instruments surfaced in the 1990 issue of UCLA’s Selected  Reports in Ethnomusicology, edited by Sue DeVale. For DeVale, organology’s  ultimate purpose was “to help explain society and culture” (1990:22), and in- struments might even contain the “essence of society and culture” (ibid.). She  surveys the scope of prior work and suggests classifi catory, analytic, and ap- plied approaches to organology, and zones of crossover between those three  approaches. Yet, none of the other articles in the special issue come as close  as DeVale to suggesting a mandate for thinking through instruments. Buried  in the article, DeVale recalls two examples from her own research, including  a theory of instrument-spirits as participants in rituals (DeVale 1988) and the  life story of the gamelan brought to Chicago’s Columbian Exposition in 1893.  Th e former example focuses our attention on diff erent possible subject/object  ETM 56_3 text.indd   366 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="5"> Bates: Social Life of Musical Instruments   relations between the scholar, instrument, performers, and society. Th e latter  calls to mind the narrative of Accordion Crimes and reiterates the potential  specifi city of organological study: sometimes one specifi c instrument is em- broiled in unique stories, trajectories, and sets of social relations.  Many of DeVale’s organological mandates were prefi gured by fi ve decades in  Robert Van Gulik’s Th e Lore of the Chinese Lute, a work that was infl uential on  Chinese music scholarship but less so on organology.7 Van Gulik concludes that  the ch’in (qin) works as a “symbol of literary life” ([1940] 1969:17) through its  aesthetics (having elegant physical features), its resistance to becoming popular  (from theoretical and practical factors), its expense and rarity, and in how the  elegant taste required to appreciate ch’in music hints at the unusual sociability  of the instrument. Th e ch’in’s ontology as a musical instrument distinguishes it  from other antique objects, as the ch’in alone is capable of giving “an impression  of meeting with the ancients in person” (ibid.:18).  Th e numerous ch’in-pu (qinpu), handbooks for lutenists, comprise a pri- mary source type for Van Gulik. Th ey contain striking details about instru- ment and string construction, playing techniques, the “discipline of the lute  player” (ibid.:32), and the “ideology of the lute” (ibid.:33). Concerning lute  ideology, Van Gulik writes: “it is suited for harmonizing the human mind,  and may move man to the improvement of his heart” (ibid.:72). In addition  to discussing musical techniques and the eff ects of lute playing on the literati  and society, several handbooks included detailed descriptions of how the lute  should be accompanied by other objects and in which acoustic environments  lutes should reside. One handbook stipulated: “Th ere should be a fl ywhisk, a  sonorous stone, brushes and ink to keep the lute company and there should  be lustrous fl owers and cranes to be its friends. All these things belong to the  domain of the lute” (ibid.:69–70). Another noted the need for a special room  in the lutenist’s house for playing, and described the material construction and  acoustic qualities of such a room (ibid.:67). Beyond human-object sociability,  several stories discussed the eff ect of ch’in playing on birds (cranes in particu- lar), and one recounted how a crane taught a master ch’in player a song that,  subsequently performed for a duke, led to an awe-inspiring sequence of events  including the summoning of a storm and an ensuing drought that lasted for  three years (ibid.:143–44).  While instruments appear to be in the margins of ethnomusicological in- quiry in the early twenty-fi rst century,8 several notable works have emerged since  2000.9 Regula Qureshi and Kevin Dawe provide cogent arguments for studying  the embodied aff ect and symbolic and aff ective meanings of musical instru- ments. In an article on Indian sarangis and sarangi players, Qureshi explores the  interrelations between audible aesthetics, instrumental symbolisms, and debates  about the appropriateness of certain performance contexts for sarangi playing.  ETM 56_3 text.indd   367 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="6">   Ethnomusicology, Fall 2012 She notes the absence of a political dimension in scholarship on emotion and  embodiment in music: To insert music into [the anthropological debate on the politics of emotion] requires  a more broadly based and widely referenced notion of music and its production. It  calls for a willingness to expand music studies from their cocoon of conventionalized  aesthetic and sonic jouissance in order to allow political and historical implications  to surface and thus to hear when music (and its instruments) speak to social struggle  and to the politics of dominance and exclusion. (2000:808) Qureshi’s work was the fi rst to connect anthropological studies of the body and  embodiment to the domain of musical instruments and instrumental sound- ings. However, one conclusion that could be drawn from her article is that con- tested meanings of the sarangi are a direct result of the web of associations and  meanings in which sarangis are encountered in Indian society—“an unequal,  exploitative feudal and increasingly capitalized class structure” (ibid.:830). Th is  is a minor distinction, perhaps, but I will return later to the diff erence between  casting an instrument as the subject or as the object of the research.  Kevin Dawe, whose fi eld research in Crete focused on a small indigenous  fi ddle called the lyra, extends a common ethnomusicological proverb in urging  us to conceive of musical instruments as culture: Th ey exist in webs of culture, entangled in a range of discourses and political in- trigues, and they occupy engendered and status-defi ning positions. Musical instru- ments are seen as material and social constructions. (2007:114) His work is strikingly heterogeneous in the scope of its ethnographic observa- tions: festivals, lyra-makers, lyra amplifi cation, the visibility of lyras in contem- porary Crete, and even villagers who play “air lyra.” In addition to his discussion  of lyra meanings, Dawe writes about instrument pedagogies and the bodies of  lyra performers. He suggests that “musical instruments can transform minds  and bodies, aff ecting states of mind as much as joints, tendons and synapses,  ergonomics and social interaction—the joy of playing musical instruments is  a joy that comes from exhilaration felt at physical, emotional and social levels”  (Dawe 2005:60). Th is assertion is one of the few in music scholarship, following  DeVale, where instruments are regarded as potential subjects (rather than ob- jects) of research, a tantalizing suggestion that there might be a broader valence  to the sorts of fi ctional accounts of instruments I began with in this article, or a  value in what might be called “thinking through instruments.”  Yet, while the lyra “and its repertoire have evolved with, and are inextri- cably linked to, the intricate rituals, spectacle, and display of the celebration”  (Dawe 2007:115), Dawe’s work stops short of maintaining a sustained analysis  of the lyra as an active participant in those rituals, spectacles, and celebrations.  He hints of the transformative power of instruments, and writes elsewhere of  instruments as “active in the shaping of social and cultural life” (2001:220), but  ETM 56_3 text.indd   368 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="7"> Bates: Social Life of Musical Instruments   most of his analysis is of the “polyvalent and polysemic” (ibid.:222) meanings of  lyra in contemporary Cretan society. Th e lyra and the lyra-maker’s shop become  sites where broader social processes (technological modernization, globaliza- tion, gender politics) can be witnessed; the subject of the article shift s to Cretan  society, the lyra becoming a prosthesis of politics (specifi cally, the body politic)  rather than the central actor.10 Dawe writes of the considerable economic value  of the lyras made by Dimitris Agrimakis, one of the last great makers, and about  changes to the pegs and headstock of the instrument. But rather than analyzing  Dimitris’s relation with lyra materialities during the construction stage, Dawe  treats the passive, inert lyras adorning the shop window as a metaphor for social  change. I, too, fi nd it productive to investigate how instruments become such  contested sites of meaning, and how instrumental sound can come to profoundly  aff ect and transform people. However, I assert, many valences of instruments  go beyond meaning, symbol, and metaphor.11 Central Asian Long-Necked Lutes  Ever since Mark Slobin’s studies of music in the social life of Kyrgyzstan  (1969) and Northern Afghanistan (1976), long-necked lutes have had a signifi - cant place in scholarship on Central Asian music. Slobin devotes several pages  to the construction, playing technique, and ethnic variations (Uzbek and Turk- men) of the dutār, and documents changes to the instrument when it moved  from being a rural instrument to one played in towns and cities. Building on  this work, John Baily wrote extensively about the dutār in the city of Herat,  discussing innovations in instrument construction, instrumental kinesthetics,  and the “complex and dynamic sociomusical situation which involves changes  in music structure and changes in the social position of music and musicians”  (1976:53–54).  Baily was one of the fi rst ethnomusicologists to conduct a lengthy study of  the kinesthetics of playing in relation to the morphology of the instrument.12 He  documents the shift  from a left -hand technique initially learned through visual  information to a later kinesthesis honed through increased “auditory control  of the performance” (1977:309). For Baily, the relation between kinesthesis and  morphology directly infl uences the nature of musical genre: “While classical  music may be highly compatible with the spatial layout of the rebab, traditional  Herati music is not. Th is shows how closely these two kinds of music are adapted  to the instruments on which they are habitually played and suggests that in both  instances the instrument has to some degree shaped the music” (ibid.:323). Baily  argues that physical changes in the dutār “have a signifi cance that extends far  beyond their interest from the point of view of material culture. Th ey express in  a concrete manner the essence of a complex and dynamic sociomusical situation  which involves changes in music structure and changes in the social position  ETM 56_3 text.indd   369 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="8">   Ethnomusicology, Fall 2012 of music and musicians” (1976:53–54). In a later work, he asserts the represen- tational power of the dutār as the “voice” of Herat, contributing to Herat’s role  “as an integral part of Afghanistan” (1988:158).  Two scholars have written about the Ahl-i Haqq tanbūr, an instrument at  the center of sacred and secular music practices of the Gorani Kurds of Western  Iran. Partow Hooshmandrad advocates for a lived organology (2004:42) based  on stories, historical meanings, and analysis of the function of musical instru- ments in human-divine relations. She writes this about the “sanctity and sacred  function of the tanbūr”: Tanbūr is an embodiment of various aspects of the Ahl-i Haqq religion. It secretly  holds the divine message of the presence of the divine; it is the instrument with  which the sacred musical repertoire of the Ahl-i Haqq is performed and the sacred  texts are sung. It may be used in the sacred ritual of Jam where, even when it is not  sounded, it is considered as a Jam'Nishīn and receives a portion (bash) of the sacred  blessed food. It is greeted by kissing in the Jam and when approached in general.  It heals illnesses, and is hung in the best part of an Ahl-i Haqq’s home as a sacred  icon with a constant purifying eff ect. Most importantly, tanbūr is a manifestation  of one of the Haft an. (Hooshmandrad 2004:25)  One of the most striking moments in Hooshmandrad’s dissertation is her  analysis of the enormous production output of the living master of tanbūr-making,  Ustād Asad Allāh. Even though the Ahl-i Haqq community in Gahwārah num- bered fewer than 15,000, Ustād Asad Allāh had produced perhaps upwards of  fi ve thousand instruments, and demand appeared to be steadily increasing. Th e  tanbūr, which had always been important in Ahl-i Haqq households, proliferated  in the aft ermath of the Islamic revolution. Many instruments ended up inhabiting  museums and Sunni and Shi ͑a households; fi ft y instruments had even travelled to  private homes in the U.S. Yet, unlike other Iranian stringed instruments, the price  of the tanbūr was stable, largely since the pīr (religious/community leader) strove  to avoid the commoditization of the instrument (ibid.:45–48) or a situation where  an Ahl-i Haqq could not aff ord to own the instrument. Th e tanbūr in this account  is a central actor—in the continuation of a minority religious practice in the face  of changing national religious politics; in a form of commerce that resists supply  and demand economic logics; in the social relations between the community  leader, instrument makers, and the local and regional Ahl-i Haqq communities;  and as a mediator in relations between the Ahl-i Haqq and outsiders.  Navid Fozi (2007) extends Hooshmandrad’s work, providing a detailed  ethnography of tanbūr-making techniques focused on the bodily and knowl- edge practices of Ustād Asad Allāh (written as Ostád Asadulláh Farmáni).  Fozi’s theoretical framework attempts to reconcile a Maussian approach to the  body as a “natural instrument” and “technical object” with Barth’s approach to  studying distributed knowledge. A key point for Fozi is the delineation between  processes where makers verbally articulate why they use particular tools or  ETM 56_3 text.indd   370 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="9"> Bates: Social Life of Musical Instruments   techniques, and conventions of the craft  that seem to defy utilitarian explana- tions. His account of bodily techniques and knowledge practices gets to the  heart of the complexity of tanbūr-making and the transmission of knowledge  between generations of makers. It also suggests the need for an embodiment  paradigm attentive to bodily capabilities and instrumental techniques, rather  than a Qureshi-style paradigm where bodies constitute a site for class struggle.  However, I feel that Fozi’s framework is less conducive to exploring certain  liminal moments. Fozi observed that makers don’t measure the dimension  of a bowl that they are carving, instead determining its dimensions “through  intuition,” and that they routinely add little pinholes in the side of the tanbūr  that have no clear audible eff ect or symbolic function. It is precisely these  moments that show the limits of an exclusive focus on body techniques and  articulated knowledge, and the perils of focusing exclusively on the human  side of human-instrument interactions. In neighboring Turkey, ‘ûd makers talk  of letting the wood “tell them what to do,” a phrase I have heard articulated  by wood turners in the San Francisco Bay Area. Perhaps a similar attention  to wood, to the proto-tanbūr, is at work in Iran, too.  Th e instrument narratives of Van Gulik, Qureshi, Dawe, Baily, and Fozi  in sum, hint at other possible valences of Hooshmandrad’s “lived organology.”  I think this can be pushed further, particularly if the subject is shift ed to the  tanbūr—not such a stretch if we recall that organology is nominally the study of  instruments. Th e tanbūrs of Hooshmandrad and Fozi mobilize publics around  them. Th ey mediate relations between pir, makers, and consumers, yet do so  without constructing a market based on supply and demand. Tanbūrs only come  into being if there are makers willing to undergo physiological and psychological  pedagogies, makers who cultivate particular bodily skills and knowledge sets  yet never attain a complete knowledge about tanbūrs (while being willing to  adorn the instrument in ways that have no pragmatic purpose nor result from  any known symbology). Th e tanbūr used the Iranian Revolution of 1979 as an  opportunity to further its own proliferation: post-Pahlavi tanbūrs serve myriad  symbolic-ornamental functions, adorning the walls of Ahl-i Haqq homes and  those of non-musician consumers alike, and populating museums around the  world. And we haven’t even touched upon tanbūr soundings, tanbūr players, or  the tanbūr’s role in healing the Ahl-i Haqq. Th e Social Life of Objects  In short, I am arguing for a paradigm that encompasses the full range of  possible human-object-divine relations, as seen in instrument making, per- formance, musical healing, and numerous other domains. Earlier I used the  phrase the “social life of musical instruments,” which we should revisit in light  of the intriguing possibilities opened up by tanbūrs, dutārs, and ch’ins. But  ETM 56_3 text.indd   371 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="10">   Ethnomusicology, Fall 2012 fi rst, a clarifi cation: in referencing the “social life of objects” or “political life  of objects,” I am not suggesting a utilitarian/semiotic approach such as that of  Stephen Riggins, where “the social life of objects is a response to complexity in  the social life of persons” (1994:20), or something akin to Arjun Appadurai’s  “perspective on the circulation of commodities in social life” where “what creates  the link between exchange and value is politics” (1986:3). In neither approach is  the material object the object of study; rather, the object world is simply another  instantiation of a preconstituted humanistic theoretical terrain or economic  system, the objects rendered immaterial.13 Th ere is a diff erence between musical  instruments being incidental to, or constitutive of, social interaction.  Th e loose assemblage of approaches that I fi nd to be most useful originates  in Science &amp; Technology Studies (STS) and in recent anthropological and  political science work on material culture.14 STS, which like ethnomusicology  is a fi eldwork-based ethnographic discipline, has produced much work on  invention and technological adoption (e.g., Bijker 1995) and the practices of  laboratory work (e.g., Latour and Woolgar 1979). Several STS works have ex- plored musical technologies, including failed innovations in European classical  instrument design (Bijsterveld and Schulp 2004), the shift s in manufacturing  of audio recording technologies (Th éberge 1997), and the invention of the  Moog synthesizer (Pinch and Trocco 2002; Pinch 2008). In contrast, much of  the new materialism literature examines visual art (Gell 1998, and numerous  articles inspired by Gell’s approach) and material artifacts in everyday life  (Miller 1998; Vannini 2009). What ties together these approaches is a shared  concern with examining “the performative and integrative capacity of ‘things’  to help make what we call society” (Pels, Hetherington, and Vandenberghe  2002:2), and theorizing the social to include people, animals, material objects,  spaces, and ideas/concepts.  Th ese divergent approaches all depend upon an analytical “naivitae” when  analyzing the relations between humans and nonhuman objects, and all tend  to trifurcate complex entities into constituent parts (also called actors, actants,  agents, objects, or vital matter), assemblages (also called networks, webs, ecolo- gies, or societies), and relationality (also called sociality and semiotics). Th e  most oft -used approach, Actor-Network Th eory (ANT), loosely defi nes an  actor as neither a subject nor object, but as a source of action, “something that  acts or to which activity is granted by others. It implies no special motivation  of human individual actors, nor of humans in general” (Latour 1996).15 Net- works are simply ad-hoc groupings of heterogeneous objects, and relationality  examines how these ad-hoc groups cohere. In conducting an ethnography of  actor-networks, the key methodological challenge is in fi guring out which  objects are signifi cant (and therefore part of an actor-network or material as- semblage) and how they relate. ETM 56_3 text.indd   372 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="11"> Bates: Social Life of Musical Instruments    Simply casting the net wider and including more objects in networks is, by  itself, an unremarkable proposition. However, these approaches all share a theory  of agency and power which has signifi cant implications for humanistic scholar- ship: agency becomes not an inherent capacity held only by humans, but rather  something “seen as diff erentially distributed across a wider range of ontological  types” (Bennett 2010:9). In short, any material object, within any assemblage,  has the same capacity for action. Political scientist Jane Bennett has written  most extensively about this material agency, which she terms thing-power, “the  curious ability of inanimate things to animate, to act, to produce eff ects dramatic  and subtle” (ibid.:6). Bennett argues that we must “readjust the status of human  actants: not by denying humanity’s awesome, awful powers, but by presenting  these powers as evidence of our own constitution as vital materiality. In other  words, human power is itself a kind of thing-power” (ibid.:10).  One of long-standing critique of ANT and related approaches is that it  ascribes intentionality to inert matter, but this is a misreading of the theory of  agency as it confl ates intention with eff ect. Lambros Malafouris, in a thought- provoking study of potters, clay, and potting wheels, argues that we must distin- guish between a sense of agency and material agency, between prior intention  (the potter planning to throw clay in a certain way) and intention in action (an  ongoing feedback systems where potters respond by feel to clay). For Mala- fouris, “agency is about causal events in the physical world rather than about  representational events in our mental world” (2008:30). Returning to Bennett: Human intentions [are] always in competition and confederation with many other  strivings, for an intention is like a pebble thrown into a pond, or an electrical current  sent through a wire or neural network: it vibrates and merges with other currents,  to aff ect and be aff ected. Th is understanding of agency does not deny the existence  of that thrust called intentionality, but it does see it as less defi nitive of outcomes.”  (Ibid.:32)  An ANT or vibrant matter approach also raises important issues about  how to analyze the temporality of networks, and more broadly how to theo- rize culture, context or community. ANT scholars write of the durability of  networks—the tendency for some networks to stay similar in form over long  periods of time, and durability is a key issue in the analysis of musical instru- ments that seemingly have produced similar eff ects for hundreds of years. Yet,  we must always be attentive to diff erently structured networks around the same  instrument type, and the multiplicity of networks that may include even one  particular instrument. Allowing agency to material objects, and thinking of  assemblages as ad-hoc groupings of heterogeneous objects, moves beyond a  culture-context divide, as both culture and context are formed simultaneously  with the ad hoc assemblages. ANT-informed scholarship could be viewed as  being wholly about the formation of culture and context, or alternately as a  ETM 56_3 text.indd   373 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="12">   Ethnomusicology, Fall 2012 mode where culture and context cease to be productive analytics. Th e networks  of ANT can do analytical work similar to Will Straw’s “scenes” (1991), but do  so with a much greater degree of specifi city with regard to the constitutive ac- tors and actants. Musical instruments constitute a fruitful site for ANT-style  approaches, as they are intertwined in myriad forms of social relations, and  instrumentalists and audiences oft en have distinctively intimate aff ective rela- tions with them. Encounters with Instruments  It is not an exaggeration to state that instruments introduced me to ethno- musicology and created the initial framework for my study. I never consciously  set out to theorize instruments, though I have been deeply involved in oud/ ͑ûd  study and performance ever since a chance encounter in 1992 with Scott Mar- cus and one of his ouds lured me into the UCSB Middle Eastern Ensemble.16  Spending time in Turkey with oud performers, teachers, students, and makers  provided an obvious variety of oud-specifi c observations, including divergent  beliefs about what ouds were, what ouds evoked or invoked when played, or  what potentially permanent physiological and moral eff ects oud playing might  have on me or other players. For this article, though, I decided against an auto- ethnographic approach, with the oud as the focus of study, since my own trajec- tory as an oudist has been somewhat unconventional. More importantly, I feel  too close to the oud to tease apart what is interesting or noteworthy about my  relationship with it.17  For the remainder of this article, as an exemplar for my approach, I will at- tempt the beginnings of an analysis of the social life of the saz, today an ubiqui- tous instrument among Anatolian, South Caucasian, and Southeastern European  ethnicities including Turkish-, Kurmancı-, Zazaki- and Azeri-speaking Sunni  Muslims and Alevi-Bektaşis.18 Th at the saz (also known as bağlama) is oft en  called the “national” instrument of Turkey (Markoff  1993:96) attests to a certain  kind of widely perceived importance, although as I will suggest, simply being a  potential (albeit unoffi  cial) national instrument doesn’t immediately mean that  the saz is symbolic of the nation, constitutes or embodies the nation, or even  has a clearly conceived function in relation to society, regardless of how national  borders might be drawn.  My own encounters with the saz span nearly twenty years, beginning in  1993 with my fi rst ethnomusicological fi eldnote, where I wrote in surprise about  the thousands of sazes I saw being carried up and down İstiklal Caddesi (a busy  pedestrian street in the Taksim neighborhood of Istanbul). My oud teacher  Necati Çelik is also an excellent saz artist who plays in the style of Haci Taşan,  and in lessons he would oft en demonstrate the intricacies of makams (melodic  modes) shared between rural and urban art musics by playing Central Anato- ETM 56_3 text.indd   374 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="13"> Bates: Social Life of Musical Instruments   lian folk music on the saz. However, it was when I started researching Istanbul’s  recording studios and arrangement practices that I personally experienced the  inextricability of the saz from modern Turkish society. Although professional  studio musicians specialize in one of over forty diff erent Anatolian folk instru- ments (see Bates forthcoming), the saz is the only such instrument to be found  on nearly every contemporary recording of arranged folk, arabesk, Turkish pop,  and Kurdish popular music. I recorded numerous saz artists, ranging from ris- ing stars (Özlem Taner, Engin Arslan, Erol Mutlu, Ali Rıza Albayrak) to estab- lished professionals (Erkan Oğur, Çetin Akdeniz, Neşet Ertaş). Conversations  with these and other artists revealed oft en contradictory attitudes towards a  multitude of issues aff ecting music and instruments in contemporary society,  including changes in saz making, pedagogies, playing techniques, and musical  meanings and contexts. I pursued these contradictions through subsequent  ethnographic observations of saz makers, performances (sacred and secular;  in concerts, houses, bars and universities), pedagogy in private lesson houses,  and in discussions of saz on Turkish social media websites.  In the subsequent tangle of anecdotes and observations, my goal is not to  provide a comprehensive overview or theory of the saz, an instrument that (like  most instruments) is grossly undertheorized.19 Rather, in order to explain the  immense thing-power of the saz, I chose examples that demonstrate the hetero- geneity of networks in which sazes have agency, and the multitude of attitudes  towards and engagements with the saz. I hope to show how an approach that  entails the study of heterogeneous networks including instruments, performers,  makers, listeners, and other material objects directly addresses many key ques- tions at the core of ethnomusicology, while extending the analytical models and  methodological paradigms that we have available. I also hope that this article will  encourage others to publish their own saz stories, to expand our understanding  of the social life of the saz. Saz and Song “Ben Ağlarım Saz Ağlar” (As I cry, the saz cries)  Şevki Bey  “Ben ağlarım saz ağlar” begins the song, which is not an unauthored türkü,  but a newly composed şarkı by Istanbul-based composer and pedagogue Şevki  Bey (1860–91). Th e phrase as it stands is ambiguous due to a missing preposi- tion or converbial suffi  x. It might be interpreted as having a sequential causative  relation, such as “when/if/every time I cry, the saz cries,” or “when/if/every time  the saz cries, I cry.” However, with syllables missing, the phrase would most likely  connote a simultaneity of singer and saz crying, folding subject (the singer) and  object (the saz) into a unity that cries together. ETM 56_3 text.indd   375 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="14">   Ethnomusicology, Fall 2012  In the lyrics to many türkü (metered and unmetered Turkish-language  folksongs of unknown authorship) and pedagogical şarkı (authored urban art  music songs) such as “Ben Ağlarım Saz Ağlar,” one fi nds copious mentions of  sazes, saz strings (tel), broken sazes, saz frets (perde), saz tunings (düzen), and  saz picks (mızrap or tezene). Sazes cry (ağlamak) and laugh (gülmek), although  based on these words’ sheer frequency alone, they seem to cry quite a bit more  oft en than they laugh, and oft en, just like their owners, feel troubled (dertli). Th e  listener in many songs is ordered to come to the saz or to the sound of the saz,  but rarely to the saz player. When the aşık dies,20 the saz might be instructed to  sing by the aşık’s gravestone. Quite evocatively, when aşık Deli Hazım wants us to  get to know the poet Karacaoğlan, he begins by proclaiming that the saz’s strings  act as an interpreter for us—perhaps not so surprising when we consider that  many aşık songs correlate the eff ects of the saz with the words sung by the aşık  (saz ve söz). Aşık Ali İzzet Özkan asks you to wish upon a saz string (teller de  muradın alsın), but probably not the strings of the broken saz that Aşık Reyhani  hung from the ceiling (kırılmış sazımı astım tavana). But the saz loses control  and is anthropomorphized when Dursun Ali Akınet’s saz becomes “unfaithful,”  the frets “oppressive and cruel”; the saz-pick “pulls the trigger” and the string  whacks him (saz vefasız oldu perdeler zalim, mızrap tetik çekti tel vurdu beni).21  Th e saz alone appears in Turkish lyrics with such a strongly articulated agentive  force and position. Even though the sound of the kemençe or tulum allegedly  makes girls uncontrollably begin dancing, the kemençeci or tulumci (kemençe  or tulum player) is assumed to be in control of the process.22  Yet I will return to the crying. One performer’s saz seemingly makes audi- ences cry more oft en than others—the saz of Neşet Ertaş (b. 1938 or 1943).23  Neşet is a folk musician who performs the traditional repertoires of the Kırşehir  region of Central Anatolia (particularly the unmetered bozlak form), and also an  ozan (poet) who authored many notable new songs, and aft er his father Muhar- rem Ertaş (d. 1984) is considered the authoritative interpreter of bozlak.24 My  colleague Mustafa Avcı recounted numerous stories where he was moved to tears  from simply listening to the sound of Neşet’s saz, in concerts and even when  listening on headphones while riding in a dolmuş (personal communication,  March 2011). On the popular social dictionary site Ekşi Sözlük, over ten authors  wrote entries about crying while listening to Neşet Ertaş, some attributing the  causality to Neşet’s saz, others attributing it to Neşet himself.25 However, Neşet  and/or his saz have a particular relation to performed repertoire. Respected saz  artist and scholar Bayram Bilge Tokel famously said: Neşet Ertaş, herkes gibi çalıp söyleyen sıradan bir sanatçı değil. Türküyü bağlamaya,  bağlamayı türküye bu kadar yakınlaştıran ve yakıştıran. (Neşet Ertaş is not like others  in the lineage of singers who play [the saz]. Th e türkü is brought closer to the bağlama,  the bağlama to the türkü and each make each other look so good). (Tokel 2007) ETM 56_3 text.indd   376 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="15"> Bates: Social Life of Musical Instruments    Th at the saz performer mediates between instrument and repertoire (türkü)  is notable, especially in light of the lingering question of performer or instru- mental agency. It leaves open the possibility, although one I must stress has not  to the best of my knowledge been explicitly articulated, that an “unmediated”  performance of türkü requires only saz and song, not the performer. Crying  sazes and repertoire mediations, in actor-network terms, point to the need to be  open to complex and potentially shift ing agentive relations between performer,  instrument, repertoire, and audience.  However, crying is not the only aff ective response to saz. Within Alevi  communities, the saz has an essential position in the primary institutions of  sacred and secular music-making: cem and muhabbet.26 In Cem TV’s satellite  broadcasts of public cem religious ceremonies, Alevi festivals, and semah dances,  the saz has a strong visibility. However, the saz’s importance doesn’t solely come  from its visual traces in transnational broadcasts. Within a lesser-known form  of cem called görgü cemi, a ceremony used to mediate disputes within a com- munity, saz ve söz is considered to be a key enabler of reconciliation, much  as the tanbūr in neighboring Iran functions as a mediator between the Ahl-i  Haqq and outsiders.27 Muhabbet is a less formal (but equally important) music  performance context that transpires in Alevi homes. Muhabbet literally means  “conversation,” and Alevi muhabbets oft en unfold as a “dialogue” between par- ticipants—not a speech-based dialogue, but rather a combination of secular  songs (deyiş, nefes) interspersed with instrumental performance. Again, the saz  is essential to muhabbet, a key actor in the dialogue, and an enabler of a social  atmosphere of equality and togetherness (personal communication, Sabahhat  Akkiraz, 19 May 2007). Saz and Nation  Th e saz has been called the national instrument of Turkey.28 A competing  cultural identity claim affi  liates the saz with Alevi sacred/secular practices and  thereby Alevism as an ethnicity and Alevi-Bektaşism as a religion. In many claims,  justifi cation originates in the instrument’s alleged Central Asian origins in a long- necked lute called the kopuz, although it is equally plausible that sazes (or perhaps  both the saz and the kopuz) derive from long-necked lutes that are known to have  existed in nearby Mesopotamia since at least the Akkadian Era (c. 2350 to 2170  BCE; see Turnbull 1972). Whether one history is more accurate, or whether both  are wrong and some other origin of the saz is speculated, is of little importance  for our purposes. Instrumental here is that in each version the saz is described in  terms that would typically be used to historicize an entire nation—it has a history  and a prehistory, a stake to a territorial claim, and a social identity. Th e codifi ed  tavır system of regional performance practices (see Markoff  1986a and Bates 2011)  and repertoire of theorized saz ornaments now used in Turkish conservatories  ETM 56_3 text.indd   377 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="16">   Ethnomusicology, Fall 2012 and private lesson-houses even suggests, if somewhat obliquely, that the saz has  its own language distinct from the languages of other instruments.29  We can perhaps best relate the Turkish-national nature of the saz to the  eff orts of Ankara Radio (later, Turkish Radio and Television) in conducting  folklore expeditions, bringing aşık poets to the studio, arranging collected folk  songs for ensembles, and subsequently broadcasting arranged folkloric perfor- mances on national radio and TV. It was through programs such as Yurttan Sesler  (Sounds of the Homeland), fi rst broadcast in the 1940s, that the nation as a whole  became aware of the music of localities and regions other than those in which  they lived, and the saz was the core instrument in the Yurttan Sesler ensemble  and subsequent national and regional governmental folk music ensembles. While  most rural Anatolian music had been traditionally performed solo or with two-  to three-instrument ensembles, Turkish governmental ensembles from Yurttan  Sesler onwards featured four or more diff erent-sized members of what became  known as the saz family of instruments.30  One of the most cogent examples of sazes mobilizing a public was an event  fi rst staged in Köln, Germany in 2000 (later in Istanbul) called “Bin Yılın Türküsü”  (one thousand years of Turkish ballads), where 1246 sazes, 674 semah dancers,  and the Köln Symphony Orchestra took the stage. Th e event was sponsored by the  German Alevi Federation of Associations, and transpired fi rst as a performance  by and for the Alevi-Turkish diaspora living in Germany. While the event’s name  underscores the historicity of Turkish-language folk ballads and hints at a Turkish  national claim, much stronger is an Alevi national claim, as semah sacred/secular  dancing and much of the performed repertoire, notably songs such as “Ötme  Bülbül Ötme,” are specifi cally meaningful to Alevis. Yet, the event transpired “in  the diaspora,” in a country where Turkish nationals comprise the overwhelming  majority of guestworkers, suggesting a reading of the event as an instantiation of  an Alevi and/or Turkish nation within Germany. Further complicating things,  some accounts of the event positively emphasized the participation of twelve  African and fi ve Greek performers, suggesting that brotherhood in an interna- tional sense was one possible message of the event. Getting 1246 sazes and 1246  saz players on one stage (and in tune) was a massive undertaking, yet even such  a clear instantiation of an instrumentally mobilized public had an ambiguously  symbolic, or perhaps polysemic, valence. Still, no other instrument would have  had such a powerful mobilizing force in that context. Th e Material Saz  Th e Hornbostel-Sachs classifi cation of the saz is either 321.321–5–6: “Necked  bowl lutes, carved, sounded with the bare fi ngers or sounded by plectrum,” or  321.322–5–6: “Necked bowl lutes or necked guitars, whose body is built up in the  ETM 56_3 text.indd   378 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="17"> Bates: Social Life of Musical Instruments   shape of a bowl, sounded with the bare fi ngers or sounded by plectrum” (Horn- bostel and Sachs 1961:23). Th ese classifi cations defi ne the saz as functionally/ structurally identical to instruments as diverse as the guitar, mandolin, theorbo,  Ottoman or Uzbek tanbur, Herati dutār, Okinawan sanshin, and American or  West African banjo. Th e Hornbostel-Sachs system was not intended to classify the  specifi city of unique instruments, but rather to highlight commonalities across  the world of instruments. Th is system focuses the museum curator’s attention on  aspects of the instrument perceived to be essential for the production of musical  sound, which hints at certain kinds of codifi ed relations that curators or collectors  might have with instruments.31 Th is mode of organological thought downplays  the ornamental conventions of instruments; that a tassel oft en hangs from a  saz’s pegblock, or that saz makers carve their insignia in the rosette covering the  instrument’s sole soundhole becomes immaterial.  However, I mentioned two possible classifi cations, diff ering only with regard  to bowl construction technique. Oddly, it is not clear in what way building up  material into the shape of a bowl, versus carving a bowl out of a single piece of  wood, necessarily results in a diff erent sound. Th is distinction could be viewed as  simply ornamental, but we’ll take advantage of this possible slippage in classical  organological taxonomy to explore a distinction that has profound implications  in the world of saz-making, aft er a detour into saz workshops and factories.  According to saz-maker Özbek Uçar and many others, the traditional means  for making a saz entailed carving out a bowl from a single piece of wood—a  reductive process of removing material to leave form.32 A newer staved-bowl  technique entails carefully bending thin strips of wood around a bending iron  and then gluing them together to form a bowl-like form, a process of adding  material to fabricate form. Additive or reductive processes, with hand tools ver- sus electric ones, imply diff erent relations between saz-maker, tool, wood, and  the semi-fi nished proto-saz object. Th e staved bowl technique was cultivated in  the craft  guilds that specialized in oud- and tanbur-making, notably the multi- generation workshops of the Manol and Karibyen families, but became a mode of  saz construction only in the mid to late 1900s. For that matter, sazes weren’t made  en masse in workshops until well aft er the founding of the Turkish Republic.  Historically, saz players themselves mades sazes, parts sourced from local trees.  Two famous saz players, Pir Sultan Abdal (see the next section) and Aşık  Veysel (1894–1973), both played sazes carved out of chestnut or mulberry wood  (Figure 2). Today, the carved mulberry/chestnut saz is the iconic saz for Alevis,  and handcarved sazes command a premium over staved ones. In part, prices  derive from the limited availability of chestnut and mulberry wood, as it is illegal  to cut chestnut and mulberry trees in Turkey and makers are dependent upon  infrequent occasions when municipalities cut or prune trees and make wood  available to luthiers.33 Also, handcarving a bowl from mulberry is laborious and  ETM 56_3 text.indd   379 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="18">   Ethnomusicology, Fall 2012 Figure 2.

Despite the  price premium, and a potentially negligible diff erence in sound quality, Özbek  Uçar’s workshop still fi lls many orders for carved sazes. Özbek’s atölye is similar  to the tanbūr workshop of Ustād Asad Allāh described by Hooshmandrad and  Fozi; both provide instruments for a steadily increasing worldwide market for  sacred instruments, and both continue to use traditional tools and woods.  Th ere is more than one way to make a saz, however. In Özbek’s atölye (work- shop), he and two other master craft smen, İlyas Demir and İsmail Akpınar,  produce a small number of instruments per month, utilizing many traditional  handtools (planes, scrapers, chisels, gouges) and some newer electric machines  (band and circular saws, bench grinders). Each of them works on each stage of  the construction process. In contrast, in Saz Müzik Aletleri, a saz fabrika (fac- tory) owned by Hasan Sarıkaya, construction is done in more of an assembly-line  manner, although nearly all of the work is still done by master craft smen (and  with handtools).34 Many of Hasan’s employees developed their knowledge and  skills in atölye-like environments before becoming fabrika employees, but at the  fabrika specialize in one stage of the process: cutting and bending wood staves,  planing and truing the saz neck, drilling holes in the pegblock and fi tting tuning  ETM 56_3 text.indd   380 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="19"> Bates: Social Life of Musical Instruments   Figure 3.

In each  of these stages, the relationship between maker, saz, and tool changes. When us- ing a bandsaw, the maker moves the wood while the tool remains fi xed in place  (the bandsaw blade has just enough fl ex to enable the cutting of curves, but not  too much to hinder the cutting of straight lines); when using a handplane, the  maker manipulates the tool directly over or through the proto-instrument while  it is held fi rm to the workbench with clamps. At various stages the wood must  rest and endure changes in temperature and humidity, otherwise the instrument  will continue fl exing aft er it has been assembled. Th is was most visible at Hasan’s  fabrika, where the second and third story rooms were fi lled with upwards of ten  thousand sazes in various states of completion (Figure 5). In the tool-centric  stages of the process humans appeared to have some degree of control over the  wood (although recalling Malafouris’s accounts of pottery making, the control  ETM 56_3 text.indd   381 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="20"> Figure 4.

Some half-fi nished sazes warp too  much and will not become instruments; others need to have their necks replaned  and retrued.  Whereas each instrument from Özbek’s atölye results from a unique dia- logue between Özbek and the customer, Hasan’s shop produces many instru- ments with the same combination of woods and a standardized playability. For  Özbek, construction is a process that is individually negotiated and transpires in  relation to his perceived understanding of how the particular instrument may  be used by the saz-playing end-user—whether it will be picked, strummed, or  played şelpe-style,35 and for what kinds of music it will be used. For Hasan, his  standardized instrument models are informed by knowledge of thousands of  prior maker-customer negotiations and are designed to address the most com- mon concerns. One of Hasan’s primary markets is Germany, where there is a  large demand for sazes among guestworkers and second-generation Turkish- Germans. Expanding on his international ambitions, Hasan hopes to implement  a web-based ordering system, where prospective customers choose neck length,  tekne (bowl) length, and woods from drag-down menus, designing their own  custom instruments without necessitating any face-to-face interaction.  Th is brings up the issue of the variable mobility of saz instruments, histori- cally and in the present. Aşıks such as Dadaloğlu were “wandering minstrels”  who travelled Anatolia and Central Asia performing folksongs, popular tales,  and oral epics such as the Book of Dede Korkut or Epic of Köroğlu. Th e aşık pro- fession has existed in name since the fi ft eenth century (Başgöz 1952), and aşıks  nearly always travelled with their sazes, bringing with them music, news from  other villages, and of course the crying and troubles of the instrument.36 Modern  aşıks travel even farther, touring European and North American festival circuits  by plane and train. However, not all sazes in historical Anatolia travelled. I have  previously mentioned saz-making saz players and their use of local woods. One  of their sazes might have experienced its birth, troubles, crying, and eventual  death all within a one-mile radius of that fi rst felled tree.  But it is not just the instruments themselves that traverse transnational mar- kets. Many sazes today, including those made in an atölye or fabrika, use exotic  woods that would have once been unimaginable. African wenge and zebrawood,  Brazilian rosewood, Sri Lankan ebony, and American curly maple oft en replace  the traditional mulberry and chestnut carved bowl, and these exotic materials  are sometimes stained in wild colors, such as orange, purple, or green. Th is is  partly due to changing aesthetics, but perhaps more signifi cant is the absence of  a suffi  cient sustainable forestry initiative within Turkey coupled with the ready  availability of exotic foreign woods (no matter how rare). Yet, these particular  woods gained much value and notoriety, as well as a transoceanic distribution  ETM 56_3 text.indd   383 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="22">   Ethnomusicology, Fall 2012 network, during the peak of the European colonization of Africa, Oceania, and  Central-South America.37 In Turkey today, critiques of colonialism, imperialism  and transnational capitalism are quite vehement and public,38 yet knowledge of  the kinds of exploitative labor practices and slash-and-burn decimation of the  world’s forests that produce the raw materials for new sazes is non-existent. Is  the modern saz a key cultural actor whose very existence is made possible by  colonial exploitation, cargo ships, and environmental destruction? I’ll leave that  question unanswered for now. Saz, Image, and Body  Like some other stringed instruments, the saz is itself described in human- anatomical terms. It has a body (gövde), neck/arm (kol), breast (göğüş), cheek  (yanak), and seven ears (kulak), though it is not clear how long this terminology  has been used to refer to saz anatomy. But within Alevi history, the saz’s anatomy  has consistently been related to religious imagery, as the body represents ‘Alī, the  neck represents ‘Alī’s sword, and “the 12 strings of the large saz symbolize the 12  imams” (Markoff  1986b:48). In Alevi cem (sacred ceremonies), saz bodies and  human bodies come together ritualistically when the dede (religious leader) kisses  the saz and touches it to his head before commencing playing (Özdemir 2008).39  Th e most oft -duplicated historical image involving the saz is that of Pir  Sultan Abdal (d. 1560), a rural Anatolian martyr who fought against Ottoman  authoritarianism and was ultimately hung for his resistance. His poetry lives  on as a cornerstone of Anatolian folk literature, and continues to be set to mu- sic to this day, particularly in Alevi sacred and secular music practices and by  Anatolian rock groups.40 However, here we are interested in Pir Sultan’s carved  kestane (chestnut) saz, which he holds above his head with both hands as if it  were a rifl e or sword (Figure 6). We have already touched on the endurance  of carved bowl designs, but let us now consider the iconography of Pir Sultan  in relation to his legendary life and what it might mean to brandish a saz as a  weapon. In the hands of Pir Sultan, the saz becomes a weapon against injustice  and imperial oppression; he does not even need to play it for its eff ect to be felt.  Perhaps, to invoke a familiar adage, Pir Sultan Abdal implores us to believe that  “the saz is mightier than the sword.”  Not only Pir Sultan holds the saz in a manner that suggests nonnormative  playing techniques. Th e Turkish-born, Germany-based duo Derdiyoklar, who  inaugurated the diskofolk movement of psychedelic-rock- and disco-inspired  interpretation of Anatolian folk songs and Alevi secular music, used elektrocura  (a small elektrosaz) as part of their own unique form of musical theatre.41 Derdiy- oklar performed regularly for wedding receptions for German Turks, where their  performances included dramatic theatrical suites that moved between heavy  ETM 56_3 text.indd   384 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="23"> Bates: Social Life of Musical Instruments   Figure 6.

For example, in their 1984–85 performances of  Dadaloğlu’s “Kalktı göç eyledi avşar elleri (yollar bizimdir),” Ali Ekber Aydoğan  interrupted the song lyrics “Belimizde kılıcımız kirmani” (In our mountain pass  our swords are broken) with “rifl e fi re” that he produced sonically, by playing  with heavily strumming stopped strings and gesturally mimicking the motions  of rifl e use with his electrocura.42  One night in Ankara, in a restaurant that hosts regular performances of East- ern Anatolian folk music, I sat with several folklore students and the restaurant’s  proprietor. Th e subject of why I was interested in Turkish folk music came up,  and the proprietor (who remains nameless per his request) started grilling me  on why I didn’t play music from my own memleket (ancestral homeland), why  I played music that wasn’t in my own kan (blood). Upon learning that I sang  ETM 56_3 text.indd   385 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="24">   Ethnomusicology, Fall 2012 türkü and played the oud, an instrument most commonly encountered by Turks  today in Ottoman art music ensembles and Kurdish arabesk arrangements and  likewise associated with Arabness or multiculturalism but never Turkishness,  the proprietor was even more confused. Why didn’t I play the saz? Aft er all, if I  really wanted to get closer to Turkish music and Turkish people, the saz was the  instrument I needed to play. Th e conversation moved into a general discussion  of what would need to happen for me to “become more Turkish” (Türkleşmek). It  was agreed that simply by holding, playing, and interacting with a saz I would be- come more Turkish (although other things might be additionally necessary, such  as taking a Turkish surname and converting to Islam). Note that the potential of  causation went one way. If I played a saz I wouldn’t run the risk of rendering it  less Turkish; the saz itself contained an exclusive potentiality to impact change.  I encountered similar convictions on numerous occasions—that a repetitive  physical practice involving certain musical instruments would unequivocally  change me as a person.43  Th e function of saz pedagogy in contemporary Turkish society warrants  further attention. Of all the instruments in Turkey, the saz has accumulated  the greatest range of pedagogical theories, method books, instructional videos,  and private school franchises. As part of the national project, the saz became  the key instrument in Turkey, even though it didn’t have truly national distri- bution before the establishment of the Peoples Houses in 1932 and folk music  conservatories some years later. Saz pedagogy did not just make foreigners more  Turkish, but made modern Turkish citizens more Turkish. Part of the Atatürk- ian project for national development was the division of rural Anatolia into  administrative regions, and we can observe the eff ects of this in the codifi cation  of tavır—regionally defi ned saz performance practice systems. By learning a set  of picking patterns and some standardized repertoire, one “learned” the music of  an unfamiliar region. To underscore, it was not conceptual or abstract learning  that inculcated a richer sense of Turkishness or regional/national awareness, but  rather a kinesthesis, a set of repetitive practices on the saz. Kevin Dawe suggested  something similar in describing the lyra as part of the Cretan “body politic”  (2007:111) and as “conventionalized by the in-corporation of social meanings  where the body becomes imbued with social meanings, norms, values and be- liefs” (ibid.:128; emphasis in original). Conclusion: Questioning Instruments  I fi nd fascinating the extent to which agentive sazes are implicated in numer- ous facets of life in contemporary Turkish society, from the ongoing legacies of  a Turkish national project to the politicization of minority religious practices to  the transformations of craft  guilds and transnational lumber industries. Sazes in  ETM 56_3 text.indd   386 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="25"> Bates: Social Life of Musical Instruments   the twentieth and twenty-fi rst centuries are a constituent force in pedagogical  projects as much as aesthetic or political ones. Despite the presence of numerous  other instruments, the saz continues to wield an immense amount of thing- power, and saz education at private lesson-houses, public educational institutions  and conservatories continues to transform the bodies and sensoriums of much  of the country’s population, perhaps to an even greater extent than compulsory  military service and other rituals of the state.44 Th e saz enables Alevi muhabbet  and cem ceremonies, and to this day still communicates its troubles to listeners.  My own grappling with the specifi city of the social life of the saz, and with  questions such as defi ning what precisely is “national” about “national instru- ments,” led me to a number of rhetorical and practical questions—questions  which I hope will contribute to a lived organology that is attentive not just to  the vibrancy of living musical styles and musicians, but also to the vibrant life  of the material world. Most of these questions could be asked about any specifi c  instrument, and, furthermore, most could be asked about instruments within  any heterogeneous network, whether that network operates within a locality,  region, nation, diaspora, virtual space, or still-undefi ned cultural geography.  Some questions I have posed, such as “does the performer perform the instru- ment or the other way around?” may border on the absurd. Yet, the inability to  fi nd a consensus regarding this seemingly pedantic question (let us not forget  the red violin, green accordion, or the lyrics of numerous türküs) suggests a  lingering discomfort and inadequacy with human-centered conceptualizations  of “performance” and “agency.” • Why do some musical instruments (but not others) possess the performing musi- cian and/or the audience, and how do such possessions happen? • Does the performer perform the instrument or the other way around? • Why are some musical instruments caught in an allegorical web overfl owing with  symbolism and symbolic associations, while others comparatively seem to lack  symbolic references? • Why are some (but not all) instruments anthropomorphized; for example, being  regarded as capable of crying or feeling sorrow? • Why do some instruments have an instrumental role in moral pedagogy, meaning  that simply from the act of repetitively playing them the player becomes a better  or worse human being or a subject of the nation? • In what ways can we understand the eff ects of “national” instruments not in  symbolic or metaphoric terms but as an actual mobilization of a nation? • Why do some instruments necessitate a “poor” ergonomic position for the per- forming musician, an ergonomics oft en leading to permanent injury? • Why is there a resistance to the adoption of ergonomically “improved” versions  of some instruments, and what does that resistance tell us about instrument- performer relations? • What sensoriums and kinesthetics are necessary for performers to interact with  instruments? What happens in that interaction, and how do certain modes of  ETM 56_3 text.indd   387 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="26">   Ethnomusicology, Fall 2012 interaction necessitate the cultivation of a specifi c bodily or sensory pedagogy  on the part of the performer? • Why do some instruments become the site of legal struggles (being banned or  restricted in their performance or construction) or even the targets of attack dur- ing civil war (as was the case with instrument makers in Iraq in the mid-2000s),  while others seem exempt from litigation or confl ict? • Where is the power of sacred instruments located, and how does that sacredness  relate (or not relate) to the practices, beliefs and sensoriums of religious experience? • How do instrument makers relate to the instruments they make at diff erent stages  in the making process, and how do those relations themselves relate to the myriad  ways in which instrumentalists relate to instruments? Alternately, how does the  proto-instrument mediate between instrument maker and user? • How do makers adapt/respond to changes in the available raw materials, construc- tion tools, and instrumental forms/designs available to them and subsequently  alter the way in which instruments are made? How far is too far, or in other words,  how much can construction techniques, materials, or formal aspects change with- out resulting in a new instrument?  Furthermore, I assert that one of the aspects that makes ethnomusicology  distinct from other humanistic social sciences is the unique powers and roles  of instruments within the lives and studies of both the ethnomusicologists and  their interlocutors. For many ethnomusicologists (myself included), instruments  alone enable long-term participant observation of a sort and intensity that would  be inconceivable in any other social milieu. What might begin as a topical cu- riosity quickly becomes a vital research implement that (oft en inadvertently or  subconsciously) structures the entire research methodology many of us adopt  while in the fi eld. Instrumentality is oft en implicated in the ethnomusicologist’s  ability to “understand” a music culture, yet there is rarely any sustained account  of how this transference comes to take place.45  As I argue for a consideration of musical objects, I also warn against a  wholesale march toward a new fetishized “object” (more accurately, topic) of  study. One assertion I make in this article is that “the social” has not been ad- equately studied and theorized because of a paucity of attention given to how  social relations are mobilized around material objects and the thing-power  that they possess. Likewise, our understanding of “music” can be greatly en- riched through an increased understanding of the means of sound production,  similarly requiring an attention to objects and instrumentality. Th us, many of  the key concerns in ethnomusicology as well as in musicology and numerous  branches of anthropology—of the study of music in/as culture—intersect in  vital ways with the world of objects.

Th e idea for this paper emerged during weekly gatherings for Cornell’s Society  for the Humanities, and I wish to thank its director Timothy Murray, and Society Fellows Michael  Jonik, Jolene Rickard, and Lawrence Chua for their provocative questions and encouragement. I  thank Larry Witzleben, Andy McGraw, Adam Smith (Cornell), Mustafa Avcı, and Ladi Dell’aira  for invaluable feedback on earlier draft s of this article.

Finally, I thank Scott Marcus for facilitating my fi rst encounter with an  oud and for continued mentorship. Notes  1. I also fi nd it interesting that despite Proulx’s novel being a bestselling work of “historical  fi ction,” written with a great attention to locality and period-specifi c dialogue and detail, I could  fi nd no published review of the work that lambasted Proulx for allowing so many characters to be  possessed by a musical instrument. Such criticisms weren’t levied against Th e Red Violin, either.  2. Th e golem, in Jewish mythology, was an anthropomorphic being created out of clay and  other inanimate objects. In many accounts, a rabbi (and later, in popular fantasy novels, a wizard)  creates a golem for a particular purpose, oft en to protect Jewish society (or the wizard’s lab), but  loses control of the golem, and the golem subsequently sets on a path of mindless destruction.  Golems, unlike other monsters, lack evil intent or the power to possess humans. Th e golem simply  didn’t know any better, and its creator didn’t understand the nature of what s/he was creating. On  the golem and science, see Pinch (2000).  3. In Herman Melville’s Pierre: “Th e guitar was human; the guitar taught me the secret of the  guitar; the guitar learned me to play on the guitar. No music-master have I ever had but the guitar  . . . it knows all my past history . . . Bring me the guitar” (1992:125). A similar premise is found in  Robert Cezar’s novel La Guitarra. I thank Michael Jonik and one anonymous reviewer for these  references.  4. I don’t intend this primarily as a critique of museum curatorial work. One of the aff ective  powers of instruments is their ability to continue to enchant subsequent generations, even when  instruments no longer sound and are contained within protective cases. In a similar vein, Jude Hill  writes of how “magic haunts modernity” (2007:72) in relation to British amulets and charms that  continue to enchant aft er being removed from their original context and deposited in museums.  5. Th e passage on organology in Ethnomusicology: An Introduction expands on Hood’s inqui- ries, suggesting questions collectors could use when collecting a particular instrument (Dournon  1992:290–94). Dournon’s list is similar to folksong-collecting questionnaires, and follows a similar  functionalist paradigm.  6. Specifi cally, the Galpin Society Journal, Journal of the American Musical Instrument Society,  and the shorter-lived Archiv für Musikorganologie.  7. Ethnomusicologists today refer to the qin as a zither, not a lute, but following Van Gulik I  retain his terminological choices in this discussion.  8. For example, despite the broad applicability of DeVale’s article, it has yet to be cited in any  North American publications or the major European ethnomusicology journals. Also, instruments  do continue to be a topic of several national schools; in China and Turkey, many articles, books and  musicology dissertations focus on the history and construction of a particular instrument (e.g.,  Çolakoğlu 2008, Soydaş 2007). Th ese literatures, as well, seem to have a limited circulation.  9. Also noteworthy is Doubleday (2008), a broad survey of prior ethnomusicological work  into musical instruments and gender.  10. Dawe is not the fi rst to relate instruments to societal norms. Curt Sachs writes about the  evolution of masculine instruments (the trumpet), feminine ones (plucked strings), and how the  fl ute became universally viewed as a “love charm” (1962:94–95). However, Sachs views these as  ETM 56_3 text.indd   389 8/17/12   10:47 AM </page> <page sequence="28">   Ethnomusicology, Fall 2012 symbolic, not constitutive, relations, and does not question the eff ects of performing gendered  instruments.  11. In addition to Dawe’s work, other recent publications on metaphoric, symbolic, and ana- logic meanings of instruments include Kartomi (2005) and Magowan (2005).  12. Ethnomusicological writings on instrumental technique used the terms kinesthetic and  kinesthesis as early as 1960, but Baily was arguably the fi rst to treat the topic as the center of analysis.  A compelling recent study of the “sensual culture of the guitar,” which brings kinesthesis in dialogue  with a consideration of aff ect, is Dawe (2010).  13. John Law writes even more forcibly about this issue: “Artefacts may, indeed, have politics.  But the character of those politics, how determinate they are, and whether it is possible to tease  people and machines apart in the fi rst instance—these are all contingent questions” (1992:383).  14. For a recent survey of diff erent STS approaches to materiality, see Law (2010).  15. Th e earliest manifestation of ANT defi ned an actor as “any element which bends space  around itself, makes other elements dependent upon itself and translates their will into a language  of its own” (Callon and Latour 1981:286).  16. It was the oud that brought me to Turkey the following year and opened up a path of  ethnomusicological inquiry. More accurately, there have been several ouds: the Egyptian oud I  borrowed from Scott and the fi rst I bought in Antalya in 1993 were somewhat poor instruments,  but their imperfections led me on a long-term search for better instruments and for instruction  in Turkish art music performance. Not only specifi c instruments—but more abstract instrument  categories or sensibilities (e.g., the desire to perform oud music)—can be signifi cant actors.  17. Many ethnomusicological works follow the ethnomusicologist’s own process of learning  an instrument (e.g., Berliner 1993; Rice 1994). While that can be a productive frame, I feel that  such works tend to shift  the subject to the relation between ethnographer and fi eld, between the  scholar and his/her other, a diff erent relation than I’m suggesting in this article.  18. Th e South Caucasus region includes modern-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia.  Kurmancı and Zazaki are languages in the Northwestern Iranian language family (oft en lumped  together under the moniker “Kurdish language”). Alevi-Bektaşis comprise a heterodox religious  sect that adopted elements of Shi ͑a Islam; Alevis (who are at the center of this study) are additionally  a hereditary ethnicity.  19. An excellent introduction to the saz (and related instruments) in pre-1960s rural Anatolia  is Lawrence Picken’s Folk Musical Instruments of Turkey (1975).  20. Aşıks are professional folk singers who compose poetry and perform the saz. Historically,  aşıks travelled transnationally and thus were important carriers of news, stories, and saz traditions  (Başgöz 2008). Some regions feature aşık competitions and folk-song duels (Erdener 1995).  21. A full analysis of even the poems selected here and their authors is beyond the scope of  this work. For an English-language introduction to Turkish folk poetry, see Başgöz (1952) and  Başgöz (1998). For more on Ali İzzet Özkan, see Başgöz (1994); on Reyhani, see Kartarı (1977).  22. Th e türkü “Gene Geldi Yaz Başi” from Rize contains a typical passage, “kemençeyi çalayi  kızlar oynayi kızlar” (play the kemençe, make the girls dance). Th e kemençe doesn’t play itself or  possess the owner in such türküs; rather, its sound has an eff ect. Also perhaps of note: there is no  standard term for “saz player” in Turkish, while there are established terms for nearly all other  instruments.  23. Neşet Ertaş’s autobiographical song “Bin dokuzyüz otuzsekiz cihana” (In 1938 I came into  the world) and most trusted biographies cite 1938 as his date of birth. His handwritten autobiog- raphy from 1996 lists 1943 as his birth year, but handwriting analysis shows that the original date  had been written as “1933,” with a “4” superimposed over the fi rst “3” with a diff erent pen.  24. Irene Markoff  writes about Muharrem Ertaş in her dissertation (1986a).  25. Author Yuksel wrote: “aslında kötü bir adamdır. zira kimsenin beni böyle ağlatmaya hakkı  yoktur” (10/19/2005): “anyways he’s a bad man, because no one has the right to make me cry like  this.” http://www.eksisozluk.com/show.asp?t=neşet+ertaş (accessed 15 April 2011).

Irene Markoff  notes that the saz is a primary tool in Alevi communities to educate youth  about Alevi beliefs and worldviews (personal communication).  27. Irene Markoff  (2002) writes of görgü cemi and focuses primarily on the role of the dede  (religious leader); the power of the saz in helping enable such reconciliations was a topic of personal  communications with Ulaş Özdemir (2006–07) and Dertli Divani (2007).  28. See Kurt (2003) and Ersoy (2011).  29. Lest we overread the language allegory, it is interesting to consider that the Turkish word  for language, dil, can also mean tongue (relating to the aşık’s words in the song trope saz ve söz),  but in Alevi poetry sometimes refers to the heart—an organ that is believed to be essential both for  giving and receiving true communication. In Ottoman Turkish compound forms, dil also means  heart, such as the Turkish makam suz-i dil-ârâ, meaning “setting the heart on fi re.”  30. Saz family distinctions are based on the length of the instrument’s tekne (bowl). From  smallest to largest are the cura (8–12”), dedesaz, tambura, çöğur, and divan (greater than 18.5”).  Th e term bağlama typically refers to tambura and çöğür-sized instruments, and the meydan sazı  is a longer divan. Kısa sap refers to shorter-neck versions of a saz. Other common names for saz  family members include üçtelli, bam telli, balta, ruzba, and kopuz (Bates 2011:13–15).  31. A thought-provoking recent work on the changing nature of organology and the practices  and attitudes of collectors and museum curators is Dawe (2001).  32. I visited Özbek’s workshop in the Mecediyeköy neighborhood of Istanbul with Yılmaz  Yeşilyurt and Ladi Dell’aira in January 2009; details in this work result from interviews with Özbek  and fi eld notes.  33. One interesting instance of government-luthier-consumer interaction was the excavation  of an abandoned mine near Turkey’s Eastern Black Sea coast. Th e beams that supported the mine  were made of old growth sitka spruce, a kind of wood nearly inaccessible today due to deforesta- tion, yet preferred for the soundboards of ouds, sazes, tanburs, and many other instruments. Oud  and saz makers oft en let their customers know their instruments are made of 100-plus year aged  spruce wood from that mine; I own one such oud. Other luthiers employ sitka spruce logs that  once were used as fi sh nets in Alaska and found underwater near riverbanks (MacPherson 1998).  34. Notes about Hasan Sarıkaya and Saz Müzik Aletleri result from an interview in January  2009, informal communications with Bob Beer who works part-time for the fi rm, and observa- tions of the fabrika in Sarıgazi (an industrial city east of Istanbul) and showroom in Okmeydanı  (a neighborhood of Istanbul).  35. Şelpe, also called pençe, is a fi nger-picking style believed to be the original playing style of  the kopuz (the Central Asian predecessor to the saz). Th e style had largely disappeared in Anatolia,  but in the 1970s-80s a number of professional folk musicians (including Hasret Gültekin, Arif Sağ,  and Erol Parlak) studied the technique with a performer and saz maker located in Fethiye named  Ramazan Güngör (1924–2004) and repopularized it for a national audience.  36. Başgöz traces the history of aşıks to the eleventh century when the profession was known  as ozan (poet) and ozans performed the kopuz, a predecessor of the saz (1952:331).  37. For example, Paraguay, a Spanish colony, was “known for its fi ne hardwood products” as  early as the 1600s, and hardwoods developed into its second largest economic sector by the late  1700s (Cooney 1979:187). A more exhaustive history of colonial and postcolonial deforestation  can be found in Williams (2003). One of the few scholarly works to link the international trade in  hardwoods with instrument construction is White and Myers’s study of woodwind instruments  made between 1857 and 1931 by Boosey &amp; Company (2004).  38. Th ere has yet to be a study of post-1980 political protest in Turkey and the near-daily  demonstrations and marches held in Beyoğlu (Istanbul) and on Ankara university campuses. Watts  (2010) includes some discussion of anti-imperialism protests but focuses on Kurdish examples.  39. Ulaş Özdemir has conducted long-term research into the sacred-secular dichotomy of  sazes in Alevi-Bektaşism, which will hopefully provide much richer detail about the embodied  nature and sacred registers of the saz.

Videos of Derdiyoklar’s 1980s performances at German weddings abound on YouTube  and other video sharing websites.  43. Th e tanbur used in Ottoman art music is another instrument framed in relation to physi- cal discipline and moral pedagogy. While the saz is capable of imparting Turkishness, the tanbur  is capable of bringing moral piety, and as such has seen a renaissance among some of the more  observant Muslim youth in Istanbul. Th e ‘ûd and ney are also oft en viewed in this manner and all  three are oft en regarded as tasavvuf instruments, yet the tanbur is the only one to be considered  quintessentially Turkish, the oud being of Arab and the ney of Persian origin.  44. Here I am thinking of Yael Navaro-Yaşin’s anthropological study on secularism and public  life in Turkey, where she analyzes wrestling, fl ag campaigns, holidays, and military service sendoff s  as constituent elements of a broader project of public statism (2002).  45. Most of the contributions to Solís’s collection Performing Ethnomusicology suggest that  the kinesthetic practice of playing musical instruments can lead to conceptual understanding,  including David Harnish’s discussion of the Balinese concept of guru panggul, or “teacher mallet”  (2004:132). Similar instrument references permeate many contributions to the second edition of  Barz and Cooley’s collection Shadows in the Field (2008). Despite the central importance of musi- cal instruments in both volumes, “musical instruments” or “instruments” do not appear as index  entries, nor is there any explicit theorization of precisely how kinesthetic practice leads to con- ceptual understanding.
