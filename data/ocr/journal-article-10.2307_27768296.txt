STOTHERT* Jeffrey QUILTER** Abstract The diverse, broad-based, hunting and foraging adaptive systems that devel oped in the Andean Region between 9000 and 5000 BP. are described. The evidence is reviewed beginning in the highlands of Ecuador and moving south to the highlands of northern Chile. Similarly the coastal adaptations that have been studied are described, including Archaic manifestations in Ecuador, along the coast of Peru, and in northern Chile. These cultures show considerable regional variation and divergent patterns of development. Resumen Las Adaptaciones dei Arcaico de la Regi?n Andina, 9000 a 5000 A.P.

In some of these cultural contexts plants and animals were domesticated, the foundations of the village/ food producing way of life were laid, elaborate mortuary practices were devel oped, and inter-regional exchange systems emerged. The end of the period, which is marked by dramatic cultural changes in some regions, is characterized by the persistence of contrasting highland and coastal adaptations, and distinct regional variants can be recognized within the highlands and among the coastal cultures in the northern, central and southern zones. Our goal in this essay is to review the evidence for an interpretation of the Andean Archaic cultures which has accumulated in the last twenty years. Our treatment focuses on the few regions where the archaeological record has been sampled. We will compare and contrast Archaic subsistence strategies and highlight other significant aspects of these adaptive systems. We will not em phasize lithic typologies. The region is broad (Figure 1) and culturally diverse, and the period defined is long and characterized by imprecise local chronologies. We (following Quilter 1989) have organized the evidence simply by dividing the preceramic span into three periods: the Early and Middle Preceramic periods (Figure 2), and a Late Preceramic which corresponds to the early ceramic period in Ecuador. We have arranged the evidence chronologically by using non-calibrated radiocarbon dates. This discussion focuses on the first two periods which correspond to Rick's Non-Complex Preceramic (1988), and to Lumbreras' (1974) Advanced Hunting and Lower Archaic epochs. The archaeological evidence is presented by region, first that from the high lands, then from the coast, moving from north to south within each region. We share with Chauchat (1988:65) the view that the Andean peoples of the high lands and those of the coast had separate traditions which were independent from early times. At the end of the essay we will discuss the cultural implica tions of the patterns that we observe in the data. Highlands The Hal? Vicinity The high altitude slopes of Hal? mountain and adjacent localities in northern Ecuador are characterized by numerous, deflated and unstratified sites such as El Inga, San Jos?, Mullumica, Quiscatola, Pucar? (Salazar 1979,1980; Bonifaz 1978,1979; Mayer-Oakes 1986). While some early dates and the presence of Fell's Cave 'fish-tail" points and large, broad-stemmed points suggest terminal Pleistocene/Early Preceramic dates for some of these highland assemblages,</page><page sequence="4">28 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 4 ECUADOR "~ 0 El Inga &amp;?lal?

Presumably there was a continuous evolution of an Archaic-style hunting tradition in this favorable equatorial region in the Middle Preceramic period. Cueva Negra de Chobshi Some 300 air km from Hal? is Chobshi Cave, a rock shelter/base camp located at about 8000 feet in southern Ecuador within a temperate, formerly wooded, highland valley, not far from the high paramo grasslands, where farming is practiced today (Lynch and Pollock 1981 ; Lynch 1989a). The cave deposits are mixed, but radiocarbon dates range from 10,000 to 7,500 years ago. Lynch has interpreted Chobshi as representing an Archaic way of life. According to Lynch and Pollock (1981) the faunal remains from the early deposits include white-tailed and pudu deer, hare, agouti, a variety of other small animals, dog, tapir and partridge (tinamous). These species represent commu nities of animals found in both the higher altitudes and the forested slopes, in dicating that the people may have had a "broad spectrum" orientation. It is possible that these were mobile folk who, in the early phases, hunted megafauna on the paramo, but also sought modern species in the forests near Chobshi. Lynch believes that plant foods were also processed. The paramo site of Cubil?n, dated between 10400 and 9100 B.P. (Temme 1982), could represent a high-altitude camp of the same people who utilized Chobshi. Obsidian in the Chobshi deposits, chemically identified as coming from sources in the Hal? vicinity, indicates probable contact with people residing in the north (Burger et al. 1989; Salazar 1984:50). Chobshi projectile point types are similar to types found at El Inga and Cubil?n, but other types show affinities with the Central Andean Preceramic (such as Guitarrero Cave and the Ayampitin Tradition); and Chobshi provides a "chronological and typological link" between the northern Ecuador sites and the Paij?n complex of Peru (Lynch 1989a:9). There is no evidence for the evolution or transformation of the northern An dean Archaic hunting adaptation, but it is likely to have persisted throughout the Middle Preceramic period. Only during the second millennium B.C. did the vil lage farming way of life become apparent in the highland basins and valleys of Ecuador. Upper Santa Valley and Guitarrero Cave High altitude hunting camps, workshops, river terrace sites and dry caves have been described from the upper Santa Valley where Archaic people practiced a seasonal round within a large, diverse highland valley under conditions of mini</page><page sequence="7">Archaic adaptations of the Andean Region, 9000 to 5000 B.P. 31 mal rainfall and considerable seasonality of resources (Lynch 1980:297). At Guitarrero Cave, occupied from 10,000 to 4,000 years ago, early people ex ploited a mosaic of wild resources, principally deer and a variety of plants. A series of domestic species, including beans and impressive quantities of tubers and rhizomes, were added as early as 10,000 years ago. Beginning in the Early Preceramic, textiles were manufactured from wild plant fibers (Adovasio and Maslowski 1980) prefiguring the Andean emphasis on cloth production. Although the dating and stratigraphy are controversial and Lynch's interpretations (1980) have been criticized, it is likely that maize and other Andean domesticates ap peared in abundance by the 4th millennia B.C. Central Andean Highlands Research in the extensive, high-altitude grassland (puna) not far from the Up per Santa Valley, has led to the description of the specialized, early hunting and herding peoples who lived in this zone at the Lauricocha sites (Cardich 1958, 1964,1978), at Pachamachay (Rick 1980), Uchcumachay (Wheeler et al. 1976), Panaulauca (Matos 1975), and Telarmachay (Lavall?e 1985; Lavall?e et al. 1982). I all cases the evidence for animal use shows a similar pattern of evo lution: an early, mixed hunting strategy focused on deer and camelids was re placed by specialized camelid exploitation, and eventually by reliance on herding, first semi-domesticated and then domestic camelids (Moore 1988; Wheeler 1984). This significant shift from hunting to herding may have happened by 5,000 years ago in the puna-noX in the highland valleys (like Guitarrero) or on the coast (Kent 1988; Lavall?e et al. 1982; Wheeler et al. 1976; Wheeler 1984; Wing 1977). What was the context of this economic development? Lavall?e (1985:419) maintains that the post-glacial preceramic people moved seasonally within the puna, exploiting resources at slightly different elevations within that zone. Rick (1980, 1988), following Cardich, also has argued for a year-round occupation of the high, Central Andean puna, but he claims that the ancient pattern of ad aptation involved the permanent occupation of the puna by specialized groups who exploited herd animals (camelids) and wild plants that were available year round in that environment (Rick 1980). According to Rick (1988:28) the resources of the puna, which apparently changed little over the millennia, were a good basis for human subsistence and even sedentism because of their "medium density but high predictability". In Rick's model, highland valley people did not use the puna, and the puna people restricted their activities to that zone. Lack of inter action is shown by the limited distribution of obsidian before 3000 B.P. (Rick 1988:37-38; Burger 1980), and the lack of marine shell in the high-altitude grass land sites (Rick 1988:38), until the Late Preceramic. While the people of the puna may have been isolated from others, their cul ture was like that of other Andean peoples at the time. Small round houses found</page><page sequence="8">32 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 4 at base camps resemble those found everywhere; although few burials are known, several of the flexed skeletons from Lauricocha were children who re ceived, based on the preserved record, more offerings than adults (Cardich 1964; Rick 1988:23)-an early, widespread Andean custom (Quilter 1989). The domestication of camelids by these puna people has been explained in several ways. Rick (1980) has described a pattern of population growth which resulted in specialization, isolation and regional differentiation in response to the extreme environmental situation of the Junin puna. According to Kent (1988), following Wheeler (1984), domesticated animals appeared rather abruptly in the Central Andean highlands about 6,000 to 5,000 years ago with no gradual de velopment. Kent (1988:189) suggests that the domestication of alpacas took place because puna people wanted to produce a surplus of fiber (hair) for ex port-to be exchanged for obsidian, for instance (see also Wheeler and Mujica 1981 cited in Lynch 1983:4). This prefigures the later emergence of larger sys tems that integrated both pastoralists and cultivators of domestic plants located at different altitudes. Rick sees little evolution in this way of life until its late replacement in the second millennium by the integrated Andean farming/herding subsistence sys tem. Ayacucho Valley Sequence The Early and Middle Preceramic cultural sequence from the Ayacucho Valley, a relatively arid highland area in south-central Peru where the puna is compara tively small and seasonally dry, has been used to develop a model of early transhumance (MacNeish et al. 1975). However, the seasonality of the occu pations at the Ayacucho sites is not well established (Rick 1988:31-32) and transhumance in the Early and Middle Preceramic has not been demonstrated fully. If the model is correct, the Ayacucho sequence represents another trajec tory in the development of Central Andean Preceramic culture. The implication of the sequence described by MacNeish et al. (1983) isthat the Andean adaptation evolved gradually in the Ayacucho region. The Archaic way of life was established in the Puente Phase (9000-7100 B.C.) with people exploiting modern fauna, including abundant guinea pig (Cavia sp.) from microband settlements in a variety of environments under pre-modern condi tions. The next phase (Jaywa, 7100-5800 B.C.) showed evidence for the use of all local environmental zones, including the puna. There was deer and camelid hunting, guinea pig trapping at lower elevations, plant processing, and a wider variety of subsistence activities than before. The increased importance of weav ing, bundle burials, and the use of macroband camps are other emergent fea tures of later Andean patterns. Later, this way of life climaxed in the Piki Phase (5800-4400 B.C.) with ex panded plant use and the occurrence of domesticated gourd, quinoa, perhaps</page><page sequence="9">Archaic adaptations of the Andean Region, 9000 to 5000 B.P. 33 squash (Cucurbita) and tame guinea pigs (genetically wild). Deer and camelids continued to be hunted, and more elaborate extra-regional exchange systems emerged. In the Chihua Phase (4520-3300 B.C.), beans, achiote, tree gourd, l?cuma, coca, potatoes and maize were grown, guinea pigs and llamas may have been domesticated (Wing 1977:180). There was change in equipment, the development of macroband camps, and considerable exchange, suggesting the gradual emergence of a new way of life. The change in the Late Preceramic Period (Cachi Phase, 3100-1750 B.C.), is toward food production, and MacNeish's reading of the evidence is that there was growing interdependence (complementarity) among people in different zones, leading to the beginning of the Andean vertical economy (MacNeish et al. 1983:11). Variability in the Central Andean Archaic Tradition The industries of Guitarrero Cave and the Upper Santa Valley, and those of the puna of Junin, Lauricocha, Ayacucho and even Chobshi Cave were very simi lar, forming a Central Andean Archaic Tradition (Lynch 1980:301 ). The subsist ence foci among the sites are diverse however. The highland valley people developed intimate knowledge of and relationships to plants that became the foundation of later Andean adaptations, while people in other resource zones developed other economic strategies, such as animal husbandry. Taking preceramic architecture and ceremonialism as evidence, it appears that socio political complexity in the highlands developed early only in a few, relatively low, inter-Andean valley contexts-at Kotosh and Huaricoto, for instance. South-Central Andes It is widely believed that seasonal transhumance was a feature of the Archaic people of the southern Peruvian highlands, the highlands of Bolivia, and north ern Chile where resource zones are sharply demarcated and discontinuous like islands "scattered as enclaves throughout a broad and sometimes alien coun tryside" (Lynch 1983:7; 1989b:6; see also Ravines 1972). The terrestrial environments of extreme southern Peru, south-western Boli via, and northern Chile are arid, with the Atacama Desert on the west slopes of the Andes. Santoro and Nu?ez (1987) have characterized the eastern slopes as comprised of Dry Puna in Peru and Bolivia, and a Desert or Salt Puna in northern Chile. While no Paleo-lndian sites have been found in these regions, there are many Archaic sites dated 11000 to 4000 B.P. Santoro and Nu?ez suggest that the Dry Puna environment allowed an economic pattern in which hunting and gathering were possible throughout the year, as people shifted their residence among pre-cordilleran valleys, cordilleran valleys, and the high puna. However, more marked seasonality in the Salt Puna may have encouraged a</page><page sequence="10">34 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 4 more distinct pattern of transhumance between winter occupation of interme diate plateau quebradas, with summer movement to oases, lower quebradas and high puna enclaves free of snow. Lynch's work (1986, 1989b, 1990) has demonstrated the importance of seasonal transhumance to Archaic peoples in the highlands of Chile. During the Middle Archaic, these patterns, found in earlier and later periods, were disrupted apparently because of environmental perturbations coming at the time of the Climatic Optimum (Lynch 1990; Nu?ez 1983a, 1983b; Santoro and Nu?ez 1987) or caused perhaps by volcanic activity (Ravines 1967,1972). Many sites which had been occupied previously, such as Toquepala, Cam, and Patapatane, were either abandoned or only sporadically used. Santoro and Nu?ez (1987:70) suggest that increased activity on the coast at Chinchorro sites may be the result of the migration of puna hunters to more favorable zones there. Santoro and Nu?ez's model recently has been challenged by Aldenderfer (1988) who excavated the open-air site of Asana (with radiocarbon dates be tween 6,500 and 6,900 years ago) in the high sierra (3,450 m) of southern Peru. The Asana site, characterized by prepared clay floors, hearths, midden, and stone tools, demonstrates that the region was not abandoned in the Middle Preceramic period, but it is not clear if it was a base camp in the Dry Puna or a temporary habitation of mobile people. There is little evidence for the early stages of the development of food pro duction in this region, although many scholars believe that the Andean system featuring root-crop agriculture, camelid pastoralism, and group mobility must be very old in this region (Lynch 1983:3). The evidence for camelid domestication in Chile is late, around 2000 B.C. at Puripic?-1 (Lynch 1983:5; Nu?ez 1981:155), but it is probable that camelid pastoralism began in the south-central Andes: as early as it did in the Central Andes-by 5000 B.P. (Lynch 1983:4; Nu?ez 1983a: 61 -74). The story of camelid domestication could be very different in each zone, however: the motivation in the southern Andes may not have been to control animal resources for food, but to gain more access to camelids as beasts of burden or for their hair (Wheeler and Mujica 1981:76 cited in Lynch 1983). Coast Las Vegas Complex In coastal Ecuador, the Las Vegas way of life is known from 20 sites dating between 9800 and 6600 B.P. The Las Vegas people exploited a wide variety of species in a biologically complex, sub-humid, mangrove-fringed, littoral re gion characterized by diverse plant and animal communities with little seasonality ; abundant land suitable for cultivation using simple techniques; and adequate seasonal rainfall and water resources (Stothert 1985, 1988).</page><page sequence="11">Archaic adaptations of the Andean Region, 9000 to 5000 B.P. 35 The Early Las Vegas people occupied small and large littoral sites, some on a semi-permanent basis, exploiting deer, fish and a variety of small animals. Wild plants surely were exploited, as well as gourd (Lagenaria) and squash (wild or domesticated Cucurbita, identified by phytoliths) which were present by 9000 B.P. (Stothert 1985). In the Late Las Vegas phase, corresponding to the Middle Preceramic Period, fish was more intensively exploited and there is phytolith evidence that primitive maize (Zea) was added to the plant inventory by 7000 B.P. (Piperno 1988; Bush et al. 1989; Pearsall and Piperno 1990). Perhaps cotton and beans were being cultivated also. The Late Las Vegas people increased burial ceremonialism at a large base camp, indicating grow ing social complexity in the Middle Preceramic (Stothert 1985). One small axe, found in pristine condition in the tomb of a Las Vegas woman, buried between 7000 and 8000 B.P., is very similar to axes found in preceramic sites near Talara (Richardson 1973), possible evidence of interaction (Stothert 1985). Remarkable similarity between an elaborate, secondary, Las Vegas burial and one found in a preceramic site in Panama suggests that this burial tradi tion was widespread north of the Andes. Las Vegas has been interpreted as a widespread and flexible adaptation probably characteristic of most of coastal Ecuador, including the riverine low lands of western Ecuador. Stothert, using a punctuated evolutionary model, has speculated that this successful adaptation in the riverine lowlands was the con text for the development of the agricultural village way of life and the Valdivia culture of the early ceramic period, beginning around 5000 B.P. However, preceramic sites are known only from the Santa Elena Peninsula, and the tran sition between Las Vegas and Valdivia has not been described. Talara Region The Talara sequence, from the far north coast of modern Peru, shows and early use of marine/estuarine resources. The Amotape complex (11000 to 8000 B.P.) has been defined from sites occupied near the Talara Tar-Seeps at the end of the Pleistocene, contemporary with Early Las Vegas. The area was a well watered grassland, with active mangrove swamps 7 km west. Some mangrove mollusks were found in the sites, but Richardson (1978) believes the people camped at the seeps to watch for big game. The stone tools comprise a sim ple, unifacial industry, with no projectile points. Between 8000 and 5500 B.P. the Siches/EI Estero people made use of es tuarine fish and shell fish, principally mangrove species (Richardson 1978:282) in an environment that included dry tropical forest, grasslands, and tropical sea coast with mangrove formations. The chipped stone inventory includes Amotape types and "cup-shaped mortars, two ground stone T-shaped axes, fragments of stone bowls and grooved pebbles (net weights?)" (Richardson 1978:282). The El Estero site, located away from the coast, where axes were found in all stages</page><page sequence="12">36 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 4 of manufacture, has been interpreted as a "seasonal or specialized campsite of the Siches complex" (Richardson 1978-283). The succeeding Hondo phase (circa 5000 BP.) shows a broad-spectrum hunting/collecting lifestyle and at least one cultivated plant species (Richardson 1973,1978). The six Hondo camp sites have similar flaked tools as the earlier complex, but lack stone axes and stone bowls. One of the short-term camp sites studied was a shell-bead manufacturing area, and a single obsidian projectile point fragment found there suggests exchange with other peoples (Richardson 1973:201). No base camps have been identified. Hondo subsistence remains include bone from fish, sea mammals and ter restrial animals, and fragments of one cultivated plant, gourd (Lagenaria sp.) (Richardson 1973; 1978:285). Regrettably, poor plant preservation may distort the reconstruction of the preceramic subsistence systems in this region. One would expect greater use of cultivated plants after 8000 BP., in view of their abundance in neighboring regions, such as the Late Las Vegas and Za?a/ Nanchoc systems which were contemporary with Siches/Estero, or the Valdivia and Huaca Prieta systems that were contemporary with Hondo. Richardson has suggested that the littoral zone may have been enormous when the sea level was below modern strand, exposing hundreds of square kilometers of continental shelf. He argues that "the earliest populations to inhabit the coast of Peru utilized maritime resources and that much of the evidence for developing maritime economic systems...lies submerged on the continental shelf" (Richardson 1981:148). Nevertheless, the evidence in hand points to broad-spectrum hunting/collecting adaptations on the north coast and in the Paij?n region in the Middle Preceramic. Za?a Valley In northern Peru, 49 preceramic sites in the upper Za?a Valley have been in terpreted as evidence of "an early western-slope-forest cultural tradition asso ciated with the development of a specialized public precinct and the adoption and intensification of agriculture" (Dillehay et al. 1989:733). This is an adapta tion to a seasonally dry, forested ecotone close to a moist montane forest where early inhabitants developed along a different pathway from other Archaic peo ple. The preliminary report of the Za?a research describes several surprising results (Dillehay et al. 1989:744; Netherly and Dillehay 1986): (1) that the local settlement system of about 6000-5000 BP. included a number of small villages oriented to the quebradas, small streams and alluvial fans, some in the thorn forest zone; (2) that the people constructed a pair of nonresidential mounds at the Nanchoc site which reflect an early form of dual organization "which regu lated the structure of society", prefiguring the dual patterning of later Andean</page><page sequence="13">Archaic adaptations of the Andean Region, 9000 to 5000 B.P. 37 society; (3) that there was specialized lime production; and (4) that a number of cultigens appear in Middle Preceramic contexts in association with large numbers of ground-stone slabs and manos which support the contention that the ancient people principally exploited plants, not animals. These plants in cluded squash (Cucurbita), peanuts, quinoa, plums (ciruela), and other fruits and tubers (Dillehay et al. 1989:749) -a remarkable array of plants at this early date. The developments of the Middle Preceramic in Za?a apparently outstripped those known from the coast of Ecuador, but they are close to what has been expected from Late Las Vegas peoples/societies in an area of greater agricul tural potential. The kind of sociopolitical formation sampled in the Za?a Valley may have evolved at several locations within the forested regions of the north ern Andes. Such a local development may have been the antecedent of the Valdivia way of life, which was established by 3000 B.C. in lowland Ecuador. Paij?n Complex The Paij?n complex, distinguished by bifacial stoneworking and the production of spectacular points, is contemporary with Amotape andSiches, but by virtue of its stone tools might be more logically lumped with highland lithic complexes. However, Paij?n sites are distributed in coastal valleys, many at low elevations. Chauchat sees this as the early (10,000 to 8,000 years ago) adaptation to ma rine and coastal and valley resources made by migrants from the north who no longer could rely on abundant animal biomass of the equatorial regions (Chauchat 1988:65-66). The Paij?n people apparently developed a flexible, non-specialized pattern (Chauchat 1988:41-66; Malpass 1986). While most Paij?n sites are workshop and quarry sites, some habitation midden has permitted reconstruction of sub sistence, which surprisingly has a marine fish focus and lacks medium or large terrestrial animals. Chauchat argues that the long Paij?n points might have served for spearing fish rather than land mammals. At Paij?n the midden con tained remains offish, snails, lizards, desert fox, and rodents. Chauchat has pointed out that we know nothing of the evolution of the Paij?n way of life, nor of its duration. It is not possible, given the evidence, to recon struct Paij?n society and culture, leaving us to wonder if the people retained a Paleo-lndian way of life. It seems possible that, even though they exploited a variety of species, they may not have developed an Archaic-style technology and social organization for exploiting local resources intensively. Because Paij?n lithic artifacts are widely distributed from the north coast, through the central coast (Casma, Chivateros, and the Luz camps), and perhaps as far south as lea, it is tempting to see this as a Paleo-lndian complex. There is an apparent discontinuity between Paij?n and later Preceramic adaptations, as seen especially in the Casma data, which indicates that Paij?n was transitional between the Paleo-lndian and Archaic ways of life.</page><page sequence="14">38 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 4 The North Coast and Huaca Prieta Near the end of the Middle Preceramic modern coastal conditions were estab lished and shellfish, fish and sea mammal populations may have expanded (Richardson 1981). Many have argued that coastal people re-adapted and in tensified the use of these resources after about 5000 B.P. (Moseley 1975; Richardson 1981; Rollins et al. 1986). Evidence for this readaptation is strong from the Chicama Valley south to the central coast of Peru. For example, the inhabitants of Huaca Prieta, at the mouth of the Chicama River, and other sites in similar locations, exploited wild riverine and maritime resources, taking advantage of the richness of the sea life generated by the cold Humboldt Cur rent, while also engaging in farming (Bird and Hyslop 1985). From the earliest occupation at Huaca Prieta, around 4,300 years ago, sev eral possible cultigens are known (Canna sp., Canavalia plagiosperma, Phaseolus lunatus, L?cuma sp., Bunchosia armeniaca, Capsicum spp. Cucurbita spp.). Hearths, nets fishhooks, and fish bones, and the lack of firm evidence of domestic architecture, suggest that the locale was primarily a fish ing station. According to Bird and Hyslop permanent occupation began shortly later, and during most of the occupation (down to 2600 B.P.) the subsistence economy focused on extensive exploitation of seafood and farming. The full range of cultigens included, in addition to those listed, cotton, used to produce textiles and fishing line and nets. The cotton was twined into decorated textiles in which marine, serpentine, avian, geometric and anthropomorphic forms are all repre sented. Both the symbolism and style presage later Andean art, and the diver sity in the technology signals the early florescense of the Andean textile craft. Burials at the site follow the usual Archaic pattern: flexed individuals wrapped in reed mats and accompanied by grave offerings of personal, everyday goods. While the excavations did not always reveal the context of the graves, they appear to have been placed in houses, and children were accorded burial similar to that of adults. The burial of a woman (Burial 903), dating to the earliest per manent occupation at the site, has received much attention because it was accompanied by two, small pyroengraved gourds with Valdivia style designs, suggesting either direct exchange or strong influence from the north. In the Chao Valley, the site of Piedras Negras (Deza 1988) was occupied between 6500 and 4000 B.P. by people like those of Huaca Prieta. Mortuary evidence shows flexed skeletons wrapped in mats, covered with fine sand, small stones, and topped by large rocks. The bodies showed signs of burning, and the practice of using fire in funeral rites was also observed, as at Paloma (Quilter 1989:27, 83) and in the Las Vegas cemetery. The fiber mats had cotton wefts, indicating the early use ofthat material in textiles. One semi-subterranean rec tangular stone building, resembling architecture found at the edge of the Archaic component at Paloma (Engel 1980:106; Quilter 1989:19), contained the skel</page><page sequence="15">Archaic adaptations of the Andean Region, 9000 to 5000 B.P. 39 etons of children and cotton fibers, perhaps demonstrating special mortuary treatment for the young. The antecedents of this way of life in the Chicama Valley are not known, but this occupation is not unlike what might be expected to develop from predeces sors such as Hondo or the Middle Preceramic adaptations of the Casma Valley. Casma Valley Sequence In the Casma region, Paij?n people occupied sites close to the shore and near the mouth of the Casma River suitable for exploiting marine and terrestrial re sources, as well as valley sites appropriate for collecting and hunting in the lomas (fog zone hills), and rock shelters in the puna. Little is known about Paij?n eco nomic activities since most of the sites are lithic workshops. Malpass (1986:149) indicates that the wide geographical distribution of these sites suggests some pattern of seasonal movement, but his data are not adequate to distinguish between seasonal rounds involving transhumance on the one hand and more local seasonal movements. After 8000 B.P. in the Casma Valley, the earlier Paij?n way of life was re placed by a classic Archaic adaptation oriented toward lomas resources, the valley flood plain and the nearby sea coast. The tool kit included grinding tools, plant remains show that tubers were being exploited, and the perishable mate rial culture was more elaborate than that of the earlier Paij?n people (Malpass 1983:152-53). According to Malpass this Archaic way of life involved a probable seasonal round including visits to adjacent highlands, perhaps in pursuit of marriage alliances. Sites occupied around 6000 B.P. indicate greater use of marine resources although, according to Malpass, many sites dating to this period may have been submerged by later marine transgression. In the Late Preceramic, by about 4500 B.P., in the wake of environmental changes including tectonic uplift, river in cutting, the reduction of lomas resources, and stabilized modern coastal con ditions, people resettled in other sites, stopped making some stone tools, and shifted to more intensive marine resource exploitation, an adaptation that per sisted until at a later time maritime subsistence was "superseded by agricultural products..." (Malpass 1983:158). The Central Coast of Peru The early hunters and gathers of the Central Coast have been studied inten sively since the 1960s, but the complex series of phases and periods established by Lanning (1967) and others, has now been simplified (see Chauchat 1988: 46-48). In the Middle Preceramic Period the cultures of the central coast apparently were quite uniform. Differences in lithics and site locations which previously</page><page sequence="16">40 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 4 taken as evidence of separate cultures, are now treated as variation with in a single adaptive system, which corresponds to Patterson's (1983) Paloma So cial Formation. This variability in economic and settlement strategies is seen as the result of adaptation to local conditions, which apparently elicited a variety of responses from the Archaic people. Archaic settlements of the central coast include small camps at locations where at least two of the major resource zones were in relatively close proxim ity, and major sites where all three resource zones are within a few hours walk of one another (Quilter 1990a). One example is the Canario Phase camp sites near Anc?n, occupied temporally between 5200 and 4200 B.C. by people who sought seasonally available resources (Patterson 1971 a, 1971 b). A later exam ple is the Encanto site, a small, temporary camp, 5 km from Anc?n Bay, close to what was formerly a lomas area, occupied around 3000 B.C. The remains there included fish bones, a few cervid bones, fragments of gourd and squash seeds, other seeds, chipping debris, projectile points and other flaked tools, and manos and metates, but absent were houses, burials, nets and hooks (Moseley 1975:20-21). While these sites may have been visited repeatedly and occupied over a considerable length of time, there is no evidence for the intensity or occupation indicated by the pattern of remains at either Paloma or Chilca I, both of which are found in close proximity to all three resource zones. The very large Paloma site, located at the lomas edge, is characterized by midden more than a meter thick in some places, with dense accumulations of habitations and burials and evidence that the site was repeatedly occupied, sometimes for extended periods, between 6000 and 4000 B.P. (Quilter 1989). Subsistence remains include squash, gourd, tuberous begonia, fish and shell fish, with small amounts of terrestrial animal bone. Similarly, Chilca I, circa 5700-3600 B.P., located close to the Chilca River but convenient to both lomas and beaches, also contained evidence of long-term and intensive occupations (Donnan 1964; Engel 1984:31,36; 1988). Paloma and Chilca I resemble each other. Small reed houses, flexed, mat wrapped, sub-floor burials, and special, group mortuary facilities as well as simi larities in smaller items of material culture characterized both sites, and the only differences may be a slightly greater emphasis on horticulture at Chilca I. Several mortuary practices are distinctive features of these Archaic peoples: these include a possible infant burial house as well as juvenile/adult group burial at Paloma (Quilter 1989:62-63) and a structure filled with wrapped burials mixed with charcoal and human and animal bone at the Chilca site (Engel 1964: Fig ures 6 and 7). Special mortuary treatment of the young (Quilter 1989:83), also found at Chinchorro sites and elsewhere, is a distinctive early Andean trait. Studies (Weir and Dering 1986) indicate that the exploitation range for Paloma likely stretched well up the western flanks of the Andes. It is highly likely that the caves at Tres Ventanas, high in the Chilca drainage but still in the coastal environmental regime, were frequented by peoples such as those who lived at</page><page sequence="17">Archaic adaptations of the Andean Region, 9000 to 5000 B.P. 41 Paloma. Dates for the Tres Ventanas site range from 8000 to 2000 B.P. (Engel 1984:16). Among the materials recovered from Paloma are a monkey bone from some area of tropical forest (Reitz 1988), Spondylus shell from tropical seas (Ecua dor?), and obsidian, probably from Huancavelica (400 km distant). These sug gest that the Paloman world was quite large, although most of the items probably were acquired through exchange networks (Quilter 1989:37). These Archaic people intensified their fishing and cotton-growing activities late in the Middle Preceramic period, and shortly thereafter they began to con struct the large architectural complexes and produce other evidence of dramatic social, ideological, and technological innovation characteristic of the Late Preceramic Period of the central coast. Southern Andean Coast The Peruvian south coast has come under intensive study only recently, which may explain the relative dearth of Archaic sites from Chilca to the Chilean bor der. The available information indicates adaptive strategies and cultural patterns which generally resemble those of the Andean coastal region to the north. Wise (1990) has shown that in the Late Preceramic the people of the south coast, like those of the central coast, developed maritime economies focused on high return marine resources. However, the Archaic lifestyle appears to have con tinued much longer on the south coast than elsewhere. For example, the Carrizal site on the far south coast of Peru (Wise 1990), with dates between 4690 and 4390 B.P., is an Archaic habitation site, and the huge shell mounds at Otuma (Engel 1981:29-300), 25 km south of Paracas, date around 3800 B.P.'but these sites are not associated with the architectural complexes of the kind found at that time on the central coast of Peru. Many preceramic sites reported by Engel (1980,1981) have not been exca vated fully nor reported in great detail, but they appear to be quite like Archaic sites further north, and only future research will reveal the similarities and dif ferences between this Archaic tradition and that of the desert coast of Chile. For example, El Abrigo rock shelter, on the coast north of lea, appears to contain three preceramic components, the oldest of which yielded a radiocar bon date around 8800 B.P., which demonstrate the durability of the Archaic way of life there (Engel 1981:28). Paracas 96 is a camp site occupied at least between 9000 and 8000 B.P. and situated near the Paracas Peninsula, adjacent to the sea, but also conven iently located with respect to lomas (Engel 1981:32-38). Plants found in the midden suggest that the present environment was approximated in the past. Burial practices for Encampment 96 resemble those of Paloma, Carrizal and Chinchorro with flexed burials wrapped in wild-fiber mats. Near Site 96 is Paracas 514, a village site occupied between 6000 and 4000 B.P., and characterized by houses and mortuary practices similar to those known</page><page sequence="18">42 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 4 from the Chilca Valley. Bird and sea and land mammal bones were found in middens, along with gourd, cotton, "yam", and jicama. Obsidian and camelid hair suggest highland contacts (Engel 1981:38). Three kilometers away is the Paracas Ossuary (Engel 1981:31 -32), dating to the same period as Village 514, which contained numerous adult burials in a hundred-square-meter area. Some bodies showed little treatment before burial, but others were wrapped in many layered funeral bundles. Reed or cactus fiber blankets decorated with long, knotted fringes as well as garments with cotton wefts suggest special local, mortuary costumes, demonstrating the Andean emphasis on textiles and burial ceremonialism. Some of the most prominent sites on the south coast are located by the sea, and some scholars believe that there were early maritime cultures along the entire coast of northwestern South America. According to Richardson (1986) only the north and extreme south coasts of Peru retain evidence of very early occupations because only these two areas have steeply sloped continental shelves so that the ancient and modern littoral zones are similar. Elsewhere, sites occupied on the Pleistocene plain and shore are now submerged. The Ho Ring Site, on the southernmost coast of Peru, is an enormous shell midden, perhaps the oldest shell mound in the New World, with occupation as early as 10000 B.P., and intensive use between 7500 and 2100 B.P. (Sandweiss et al. 1989). A wide range of coastal habitats was exploited but protein was extracted from the sea and littoral. When occupied, the site was 5 km from the shore, probably because fresh water was available there, although proximity to lomas plant resources was also a likely site location determinant (Sandweiss et al. 1989). The small number of Archaic sites on the south coast as well as the continu ance of Archaic patterns into much later times than further north (Wise 1990) may be partly due to the distribution of resources there. River valleys, lomas, and shore line are often much farther apart in the south than elsewhere (Quilter 1990a). One simple interpretation is that, lacking the advantage of resources zones in close proximity to one another, communities may have chosen a shifting settlement strategy, occupying relatively small sites briefly, only rarely inhabit ing locales such as the Ring Site more intensively. This pattern, combined with low population density overall, may have inhibited the social processes which occurred in the central coast where populations were concentrated in sed entary communities that built monumental architecture in the Late Preceramic Period (Quilter 1990b). Recent research on the south coast demonstrates that the preceramic peo ple in coastal Moquegua exploited resources from a variety of "micro-zones" from settlements along the coast and inland. Bawden (1989:49-53) has concluded that the varied resources supported people who were locally self-sufficient. Wise (1990) has shown that in the Late Preceramic the people of the south coast, like those of the central coast of Peru, developed more specialized maritime economies focused on high-return resources.</page><page sequence="19">Archaic adaptations of the Andean Region, 9000 to 5000 B.P. 43 The Coast of Chile Further south, on the coast of Chile, where the rich resources of the sea con trast with the extreme aridity of the land, the archaeology indicates a maritime adaptation (Llagostera 1979) beginning some 10,000 years ago and persisting throughout the period defined here, which adjusted to changing environmental conditions, and culminated at sites of the Chinchorro tradition in the Late Preceramic period. Within this tradition, some villages focused almost exclusively on resources of the sea, and others, like Quiani, located close to valleys with the potential for cultivation, showed evidence of agricultural components in their economic systems (LLagostera 1979:311). The Chinchorro tradition (beginning before 8000 B.P.) is a coastal adapta tion. Chinchorro I habitation sites, such as Quiani and Camarones-14, show a well-developed fishing technology, including shell fishhooks, lines, weights, har poons, and the use of cotton textiles by 6600 B.P., centuries before cotton ap peared on the central coast of Peru (Rivera n.d.). The inland site of Arag?n, dating between 8000 and 6000 B.P. (Rivera 1984:144), showed that the terres trial resources also were being exploited. Chinchorro II (about 5500-2500 B.P.) is represented by more sites, greater in size and more intensively occupied than those of the preceding period, and the most complicated of all Chinchorro mummies. The mummies give evidence of the evisceration of bodies, cutting and polishing of bones, re-assemblage of bodies using artificial supports of wood and stuffing them with plants, and the application of clay coatings to the mummies (Allison et al. 1984). Material cul ture included not only basketry and cotton textiles (continuing from the previ ous period) but also atlatls, the bow and arrow, copper tools, and gold (Rivera 1984:147). A striking aspect of Chinchorro culture is the quantity of exotic ma terials such as tropical bird feathers and lapis lazuli found in domestic and mortuary contexts, which suggests trading contacts with other people. Claims for the presence of maize have been made for a number of north Chilean sites, including Tiliviche 1-b, with dates of 7850 and 6950 B.P., Ca marones-14, 7420, 6650, and 6615 B.P., and Quiani, 6170 and 5630 B.P. (Rivera 1980). Such early dates surely will attract attention in the future. In ad dition, a model has been developed (Rivera 1984; Rivera and Rothhammer 1986) based on forensic studies in combination with archaeology, suggesting that the Chinchorro population migrated from the Amazon Basin, as a result of demographic pressure. This theory, running counter to the current trend of pre suming local cultural development, will also receive future attention. Summary and conclusion We have described the adaptations of various groups that inhabited the Andean region during the Early and Middle Preceramic periods. These Archaic cultures</page><page sequence="20">44 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 4 show considerable regional variations in subsistence/economy and demonstrate divergent patterns of development. Between 9000 and 6000 BP. the early peo ples of the Andes had subsistence systems centered on wild foods, but with out a big game focus. In the Middle Preceramic Period many of these societies developed food-producing economies based on some domesticated species and adopted sedentary village life, which in some places involved more intensive sociopolitical activity. The variability in cultural adaptation among these people at the end of the Middle Preceramic was conditioned by the location and char acteristics of exploitable resources in local regions. In northern Peru (Za?a) and coastal Ecuador (Las Vegas and Valdivia) mixed economies adjusted to the dependable resources of tropical, forested environ ments and the cultivation of plants emerged by 7000 BP. This early adjustment, involving stable villages, sociopolitical complexity, and the cultivation of domes ticated species, was a "climax" adaptation that persisted with relatively little change for many millennia. The people of Talara and the earliest inhabitants of Huaca Prieta maintained patterns of seasonal movements but integrated some managed or domesti cated plants into their economies. On the central and south coasts of Peru com plex scheduling and seasonality shaped subsistence patterns, resulting in shifting settlement strategies, but a few sites in favorable locations were occu pied for long periods of time (Paloma and Chilca I). Both the use of cultivated plants and intensive exploitation of marine resources appear to have been adopted only near the end of the period under discussion. While maize was present before 5000 BP., it does not appear to have played a significant role anywhere in the Central Andes until much later (Bonavia 1982; Bonavia and Grobman 1989; Burger and Van der Merwe 1990; Quilter et al. 1991 ). Along the central coast in the Late Preceramic, with the establishment of modern conditions in the littoral zone, local people took the opportunity to ex ploit marine resources more intensively. The maritime specialty supported some spectacular cultural developments which distinguish this local area from other coastal regions in the Late Preceramic. For the extreme south coast of Peru and northern Chile there is a salient maritime adaptation which supported elaborated burial ceremonialism (Chinchorro II). This cultural system also involved some villages focussed on terrestrial resources, and there was an early use of domesticated plants. These people may have maintained a general pattern of mobility like the people of Talara in the north. In the highlands, cultural systems were also adjusted to unique, local resource configurations. In the far north, (Chobshi, Guitarrero) people moved seasonally, hunting deer or camelids and smaller species, and adding domesticated spe cies to their inventories, some of which became prominent after 5000 BP. In some valleys, at lower elevations this way of life developed innovative features such as elaborate architecture and public ceremonialism (Kotosh and</page><page sequence="21">Archaic adaptations of the Andean Region, 9000 to 5000 B.P. 45 Huaricoto). The southern highland valleys of Peru were occupied by season ally transhumant people who gradually developed a specialized village farming way of life. The basic highland valley hunting/collecting adaptation contrasts with the way of life of the puna, although the two may have intergraded producing variants in local areas (Rick 1988:40). The people of the Central Andean puna special ized in the hunting of camelids in the Early Preceramic, and developed animal husbandry (based on herding camelids) before the end of the Middle Preceramic period. The highlands of Bolivia and northern Chile were inhabited by season ally mobile hunters and gatherers but the evolution of their way of life is little known. One issue raised by these data is an explanation of the remarkable variabil ity among hunter/gatherers in our period. In general, this is the result of people electing various options in differing environments. Archaeologists have sug gested that several forces drove sociocultural change in our period. These in clude population growth, environmental change, and systemic changes due to economic specialization. Also, archaeologists have made some attempt to de scribe culture change. The Ayacucho sequence has been interpreted as an example of gradualist model of change. The development of Valdivia out of Las Vegas has been visualized as a case of punctuated equilibrium. It remains in triguing that in Peru those peoples who pioneered the use of domesticated plants in the Middle Preceramic were noi the people who achieved the higher levels of sociopolitical integration in the Late Preceramic period. It is noteworthy that cultural change in the Archaic in northern Chile has been attributed to the migration of peoples. As the latest techniques in forensic stud ies are applied to human remains, tracking the movement of people in the past may be possible and arguments that attribute culture change to the movement of human populations may again come into favor. What are the implications of the early evidence of maize both in Ecuador and in the Atacama. While the single-origin theory might be possible, such a model would require a considerable degree of exchange and communication among hunters/gatherers at a very early date. Or might there have been multiple hearths of domestication for corn? Another question that can be asked of the preceramic data is: Were the Preceramic peoples Andean? It may be argued that the essence of the Andean Tradition consists of the ways in which humans organize themselves in social groups, particularly the organization of labor and its products. Taking this per spective, it is difficult to identify these cultures as Andean, but some primitive Andean patterns can be discerned in the Early and Middle Preceramic cultures. First, the Archaic peoples used textiles to express social values (Huaca Prieta, Chinchorro). The Andean pantheon was at least in part extant in the Middle Preceramic, and these people expressed ideological concepts such as binary opposition which later became important in Andean thought. Also, by the end of the Middle Preceramic, many Archaic groups were intensifying their burial</page><page sequence="22">46 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 4 ceremonialism (Las Vegas, Paloma, Chinchorro), prefiguring a major empha sis in Andean socio-religious behavior. Archaic mortuary practices are charac terized by elaborate manipulation of human remains, special importance of children's burials, and the occasional use of group burials. In the Middle Preceramic people began to use architecture (terraces and platforms, at least) to demarcate ceremonial precincts (Nanchoc/Za?a). In addition, Archaic people participated increasingly in exchange networks, creating a basis for the innovation of later, more complex forms of Andean in tegration. Ironically the movement of items over long distances is more observ able in the archaeological record than the movement of goods that traveled short distances. Obsidian and other stones were exchanged in some regions, as were ground stone axes, and shells (especially Spondylus), which probably moved in down-the-line fashion over great distances, accompanied by ideas and the seeds and cuttings from useful plants. At the very end of our period, Valdivia iconography adorned the exteriors of ceramic vessels and some of this may have been exported south in the form of engraved gourds. These Archaic peoples do not seem to be very Andean because they lack the organizational features which developed in some places in the Late Preceramic, but many of the coastal Archaic peoples do remind us of ethno graphic groups inhabiting the tropical forest today because they share features such as broad-based subsistence systems involving wild resources and horti culture, simple technologies, and small-scale, relatively egalitarian, social sys tems. These similarities may be due to parallel development or to common ancestry-that is, the modern tropical forest systems may have Archaic roots, or the Andean Archaic may have been derived from an early Tropical Forest Tradition. Although the Andean Tradition is not plainly evident among these Archaic cultures, it is clear that during the Early and Middle Preceramic periods many of the components of later Andean socio-cultural forms were forged-village ag riculture was successfully innovated in tropical forest habitats and in highland valleys, animal pastoralism was invented, early complex patterns of transhumance (the forerunners of the complex Andean vertically) were designed, and ideologies, modes of expression, and socio-religious ceremonial systems were innovated which became part of the structure of the spectacular societies of the Late Preceramic and Early Horizon periods. The various Archaic peoples worked out stable and enduring adaptations in many local areas, each tailored to local conditions. They innovated subsistence strategies, technologies, economic patterns, and sedentary settlements that supported larger populations, creating the context for the later socio-cultural innovations that gave us Andean civilization.
