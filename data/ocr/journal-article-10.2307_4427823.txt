<plain_text><page sequence="1">IN DEFENCE OF THE TRADITIONAL INTERPRETATION OF XENOPHANES FRAG. i8 Verdenius' new interpretation of this fragment 1) does not sound very convincing for several reasons. From a philological point of view it is much more probable that oOTto is meant as a negation of the whole following clause, because the words ast' &amp;pxis ....... . Wrk&amp;Lgav undoubtedly re- produce current opinion 2). Besides, when one connects O`-rOt with a'Tr &amp;pXiq nt&amp;vra, as Verdenius does, the sentence loses its perspicuity, because then OlYTOt may belong either to asr' &amp;p'is or to nr&amp;v-ro, and in both cases the meaning would be different, viz.: the gods did not show all things in the be- ginning (but only a few), or (this seems to be Verdenius' interpretation): the gods did not show all things in the beginning (but all of them in the course of time, though in cooperation with man). Neither is the opinion that the gods did not reveal anything to mankind inconsistent with Xenophanes' religiosity. As there is no inconsistency regarding religiosity as such, one cannot but conclude that Verdenius relies on his own interpretation of the alleged words 6eZv &lt;&amp;&gt; 7rpo[L-6eL'qv ao?v gxetv (B I, 24), which he does not state however. Then, what is their meaning? The MSS. -reading cpo?n6env .... &amp;ycxO'v should be retained here, whether one follows Reinhardt's interpretation 3) of this difficult passage, as I do, or whether one rejects it. So emphasis lies on a genuine reverence for the gods: man must worship the gods in the right way. To this the lines I3-I4 of the same fragment Oe6v iu?veZV .............. ?u9T00 Ll)O0t4 xoct XKC1CpOLaL X6yoLt refer, and this again is to be understood in contrast with [L&amp;yxot TLO'vov xrX. (11. 2I-3), viz. as the contents of Xenophanes' own poems. So we are turning in a circle, and consequently these words do not prove what Verdenius wants them to prove. Generally speaking, I do not see any inconsistencies with Xenophanes' religiosity. The controversial point is, in my opinion, only this that Verdenius supposes Xenophanes to have consciously expressed what the traditional interpretation takes to be only the implicit background, viz. Xenophanes' i) W. J. Verdenius, Xenophanes Frag. i8, Mnem. S. IV, vol. 8 (1955), p. 22I. 2) Cf. Aesch. Prom. 442-506. 3) K. Reinhardt, Parmenides und die Geschichte der griechischen Philosophie, Bonn igi6, p. I32 sqq.</page><page sequence="2">136 XENOPHANES FRAG. I, 24 belief in cooperation between gods and man. In other words: is it a question of implicit belief or explicit rational theory? In my opinion Xenophanes' notions about the relations between gods and mankind (and, more in general, about the causal relation between god and world) are far from clear. He did not, I think, even try to establish a rational theory in this respect. It is clear e.g. that he believed in the effectiveness of prayer (B i, I5) and in the power of (the highest) god to shake the world (B 25). But he did not believe in divination (accor,ding to Cicero A 52) or in the sense of certain popular religious practices (B I7). So we need not be astonished at all when this enlightened critic of po- pular anthropomorphism flatly denies that gods (or heroes) brought culture to mankind. But this should not prevent us from thinking with Lumpe that Xenophanes believed that all good came ultimately from the gods, because this is what religious people have believed always and everywhere. Therefore the traditional interpretation of frag. i8 ought to be retained. LEIDEN, De Sitterlaan 66A. J. H. LOENEN</page></plain_text>
