It is with great pleasure that I accepted the task of reviewing this book, for three different reasons. The first is that it enables me to do a favour to a distant Master, Maurizio Taddei, who was sent the book as a Rezensionsexemplar. The text of the review never left his pen as the book arrived in the East and West editorial office more than one year too late for him. The second is that it repays a debt contracted with a series, Materialien (MANP), which deserves the widest acclaim. If I am not mistaken MANP 2 and 3 (MANP 2 = G. Fussman &amp; D. K?nig, Die Felsbildstation Shatial, Materialien zur Arch?ologie der Nordgebiete Pakistans, 2, Mainz am Rhein 1997; MANP 3 = D. Bandini-K?nig, Die Felsbildstation Hodar, Materialien zur Arch?ologie der Nordgebiete Pakistans, 3, Mainz am Rhein 1999) have never been reviewed by this journal. The MANP series has been recently published the 6th volume, (probably the 5th is coming): D. Bandini-K?nig, Die Felsbildstation Thalpan I. kataloge Chilas-Br?cke und Thalpan (Steine 1-30), Bearbeitung der Inschriften durch G. Fusman, O. von Hin?ber, Th. O. H?llmann, N. Sims-Williams, Heidelberg Akademie der Wissenshaften, Forshungsstelle Felsbilder und Inschriften am Kakakorum Highway, Materialien zur Arch?ologie der Norgebiete Pakistans, 6, Mainz 2003. This represents a large debt towards a collection of studies dedicated to a geographic area where the presence of the Italian Mission of IsIAO (former IsMEO) has made so many contributions, but also to a sector of studies, that of rock art, contributions to which have often been published in these pages. The third reason is the professional interest I have in the rock art of Pakistan. The extraordinarily painstaking care with which the book has been prepared by its editors and published deserves the highest praise. It now represents a working standard to which the scholars having used the previous volumes have become accustomed. This may be summed up in the words used by Maurizio Taddei in reviewing the first volume of MANP (M. Bemman &amp; D. K?nig, Die Felsbildstation Oshibat, 1994; rev. in EW, 46, 1996, 1-2, pp. 220-21): 'On the whole, both from a scientific and an editorial point of view, this is a really admirable volume'. The table of contents of the book clearly reveals the analytical value of the study. The book opens with an introductive repertoire of 29 subjects and sub-subjects edited by Bandini K?nig (e.g.: anthropomorphic [worshippers, Buddhas, female figures, male figures, warriors, horsemen, supernatural beings, etc.], zoomorphic [bovines, caprids, etc.], altars, anthropomorphic symbols, labyrinths, mandalas, ornaments, groups, scenes). The chapter on br?hml inscriptions and its appendices is edited by von Hin?ber. At this stage of the book we find the recapitulatory tables and diagrams of the subjects and sub-subjects related to the sites published in MANP 1-4; this followed by the text by W.B. Dickore on the flora in the Chilas area; lastly, a text by G.A. Wagner on dating techniques (a spiny question nowadays, especially after the contributions by R.G. Bednarik). The actual descriptive catalogue is preceded by two short articles describing its structure, the choices made, symbols, and definitions. The fact sheets are flawless and subdivided according to the two sites considered - Shing Nala and Gichi Nala. This section is concluded by the bibliographic references. The section illustrated is preceded by an invaluable thematic index (which corresponds to the definitions used in the fact sheets and in the list of subjects and sub subjects) and by an analytical index. This is followed by the lexical index of the inscriptions of these sites and the general onomastic index of the sites published in MANP 1-4. As usual the plates are extraordinary in the clarity of their design, their excellent lines and the highly objective criterion of the drawings. Their subdivision according to the nomenclature used makes them a simple tool that can be used even 316</page><page sequence="3">simply for the purpose of rapid consultation, as all repertories ought to be. Lastly, the quality of the photographs is very high. What else could be said of a book like this, the result of such rigorous and rational editing and publishing criteria, which have been preserved unaltered in their essence for nearly ten years and simply improved further? I may dare suggest two indications that, although quite marginal, could justifiably be included in the references. Although it is not particularly elegant, I admit, one is an article of mine on Gogdara I (in number 1-2 of 1998 of this journal) referring to the bitriangular cap rid depictions (see pp. 83-86, figs. 43, 44 of the text by Bandini-K?nig), but above all the book published by R. Senarclens de Grancy &amp; R. Kostka, Grosser Pamir. ?sterreichisches Forschungs-Unternehmen 1975 in den Wakhan-Pamir/Afghanistan, Graz 1978. I have never found it cited by archaeologists and yet it is very rich in otherwise unpublished and unknown material of great utility. Luca M. Olivieri ?</page></plain_text>
