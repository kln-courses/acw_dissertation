<plain_text><page sequence="1">A MAP OF SOUTHERN YEMENI ROCK ART WITH NOTES ON SOME OF THE SUBJECTS DEPICTED Michael Jung Introduction The aim of the present short paper is the presentation of a map (Fig. 1) with the locations of rock art sites in South Yemen and a catalogue of these sites. A review of the subjects figured will be also given. When I say South Yemen I mean the area occupied by the former Popular Democratic Republic of Yemen before the unification of the two Yemeni states. This limitation to the southern part of the country may appear anachronistic; however, it is justified by the fact that the rock art of North Yemen has already been the subject of studies published in recent years (cf. Jung, 1990, 1991b with bibliographical notes). Southern Arabian studies on rock art have recently emerged from a long period of neglect, becoming the main topic of a French archaeological expedition (cf. Garcia et al, 1991) working around Sacda/ North Yemen. Unlike northern Yemeni rock art, southern art is still very little known. It is sporadically mentioned in reports of travellers and seekers of pre-Islamic inscriptions; the rock art as such has rarely been the subject of specific studies (cf. Höfher, 1952-53; Beeston, 1964; Bafaqih, 1978). The map of rock art sites presented to the Seminar is complementary to the map of northern Yemeni sites published in AION a few years ago (Jung, 1991b). Here I consider only sites with unequivocal rock graffiti or rock paintings, ignoring places with only 'himyaritic signs' or pre-Islamic inscriptions. However, pre-Islamic or Islamic inscriptions are sometimes accompanied by pictures. In the catalogue I compiled a list of the sites with rock pictures reported expressis verbis. These pictures may be figurative or geometric. It must be said, however, that it is not always easy to distinguish the latter from characters in pre-Islamic scripts (cf. the discussion in Höfher, 1952-53). The list does not claim to be comprehensive. I have probably overlooked some notes on rock art in the immense literature on the pre-Islamic inscriptions. Nevertheless I hope my brief list of rock art sites in southern Yemen will be useful for further studies in this field, unfortunately neglected for such a long time. In the specialised literature I found descriptions, mainly short notes, on about forty sites of rock art in southern Yemen. Adding this to the information on North Yemen, we know about 100 rock art sites altogether in Yemen. As little as ten years ago Yemen did riot figure among the 4major areas' of rock art in the Middle East listed</page><page sequence="2">136 Map of Southern Yemeni rock art Jung by Anati (1984). This is mainly due to the fact that references were mostly scattered in articles on geography, philology or archaeology in the southern Arabian realms. The main reason for this gap, however, was a general indifference towards a kind of art often unfortunately regarded as 'minor' by the scholars of southern Arabia. Today there is no doubt at all that Yemen is a 'major area' of rock art like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Oman.1 We find concentrations of sites in southern Yemen in the area of the Wâdï Bayhân (nos 2-6), in the region of Mukeirâs (nos 7-11), near Ansãb/Nisãb (nos 12-13), in the Wádi Jirdãn (nos 15-16), in the region of cAzzân (nos 17-19) and in the area of the Wãdi Rahbe/Wãdi Hajar (nos 20-23). A number of sites are also found in the Wãdi Hadramaut (nos 28-32). There are also isolated sites in the Wâdï al-Aqãbih (no. '26) or in the Wâdï al-Murukh (no. 33). Catalogue In this catalogue I have tried to summarise the information on the rock art sites given in the literature. Extent, precision and authenticity of the single catalogue numbers depend on the sources at my disposition. It has not always been easy to extract useful information from a more general description of landscape, geology, etc. The catalogue is organised like the one on northern Yemeni sites published in 1 99 1 in Naples. It can Fig« 1 (opposite).

A short description of the topographical setting of the site is first given, then an outline of the subjects represented in the rock pictures, followed by a list of the sources. 1 The area of the Wädi Harib On the map of the Wãdí Harib and the Wãdí Bayhãn published as frontispiece of Archaeological Discoveries in South Arabia (1958) numerous sites are marked as 'himyaritic rock graffiti', distinguished from 'himyaritic inscriptions'. In the article following the map, however, Bowen only briefly considers the graffiti of the Wãdí Bayhãn (cf. no. 5b). Bowen, 1958, with frontispiece. 2 Tarf al-Sãq/ Wàdi Bayhãn The site is about 10.5 km west of Hajar Kohlãn/Timnac. For sites in the Wãdí Bayhãn, see map with full details by Heybroek and Groom mentioned in 1 . The rock pictures show antelopes and two running dogs. The dogs achieve a good likeness, and their movement is well presented. Their bodies are executed in 'stippling', as Jamme calls it. Judging from the sketches given by the author the technique consists in pecking the field inside the contours with strokes to give a pattern of close points. Jamme, 1972, 41 f., 50f., pis 11, 14. 3 Jabal Awrád/Wàdi Bayhãn The Jabal is about 3.8 km south-west of Hajar bin Humãyd (cf. map in Jamme, 1952, XIX). The rock inscription (Ja 863) with the human figure was found by Jamme in the 'upper eastern corner of a southward-facing, almost vertical wall of an isolated mass of rock' of this Jabal. A rough picture of a man with upraised arms is to the left of the upper corner of the inscription written in vertical columns (Fig. 2). The bearing of the human being is quite characteristic and often found in rock art. These figures are generally supposed to be in praying posture and are called 'orans' (cf. below). Jamme, 1955. Fig. 2. 'Orans' with inscription Ja 863 from the Jabal Awrãd/ Wàdî Bayhãn (no. 3, after Jamme, 1955, Fig. on p. 33).</page><page sequence="5">Map of Southern Yemeni rock art Jung 139 4 Jabal Labakh/Wãdi Bayhãn The Jabal Labakh is on the east side of the Wadï Labakh, which flows into the Wàdí Mablaqah. The Wãdí Labakh is a narrow ravine about 3 km east of the cAqabat al-Mablaqah and 7.5 km west of Hajar bin Humãyd. Rock pictures are situated below and beside pre-Islamic inscriptions (RES 3688 and 3689). The rough graffiti depict horsemen, men on foot, a camel (?) and some ibex. Pirenne, 1991, pl. I a,b; on the inscriptions see Pirenne and also Beeston, 1971, 5-20. 5 Hajar bin Humãyd/Wãdi Bayhãn (a) This famous site was excavated in 195 1 by the American Foundation for the Study of Man. A stone ashlar block with graffiti showing three ostriches in a line was found re-utilised in the wall of building 1 of stratum С The figures of the ostriches are upside down, which proves that they were made in a preceding period. The wall should therefore deliver a terminus ante quem for the rock pictures. Van Beek dated the stratum С to about the late second to mid-first century вс (1969, 364 f.). Pirenne (1973) criticised the American datings. Van Beek's study and his supposed chronology for the excavated layers of the site were, however, recently reappraised (cf. de Maigret, 1988, 16-20). Doe dates the wall in question to the first centuries ad. (b) About 3 km north-east of Hajar bin Humãyd is the entrance to the Wàdï Farac, a tributary of the Wãdí Bayhãn. Two iarge boulders are about 1 km from the entrance to the Wãdí, one on each side of the aperture. The faces of the boulders are almost completely covered with geometric signs. These consist of circles with external strokes, such as 96 d, which can be orientated in different directions. According to the author these signs are often to be found in the Wãdí. In Philby's opinion they are himyaritic 'water-signs' showing a bucket with a piece of rope attached. Bowen, too, thinks that the signs signify water. On these presumed 'water-signs', see my brief note in AION (1990, 46 f. with bibliography). Such signs are also found at Qarn Surrãn (no. 13). (c) About 3.5 km south of Hajar bin Humãyd is the Jabal Khudra. Ibex, handprints and pre-Islamic inscriptions are below the peak of the Jabal as reported by Ryckmans. (a) Van Beek, 1969, 32, pl. 17a; Doe, 1971, pl. 110. (b) Bowen, 1958, 10 f. (c) Ryckmans, 1951, 116, 121. 6 Wàdí al-Nahr (Wãdi Bayhãn) The Wãdí al-Nahr is the lower course of the Wãdi Bayhãn. The graffiti are on a boulder in the Wãdi al-Nahr. Figures of ibex and one camel are depicted beside pre-Islamic inscriptions (Ja 2432-5). Jamme, 1972, 42, pl. 12. 7 Mukeiràs Beeston reports a great number of graffiti and rock inscriptions around Mukeirãs. He publishes two plates.</page><page sequence="6">140 Map of Southern Yemeni rock art Jung Besides pre-Islamic inscriptions they show animal figures, probably ibex, executed in different periods. Those with the entire body hammered seem to be the most ancient. The most recent figures consist only of an outline and have a very light patina. From the same area Jamme publishes graffiti from boulders with the inscriptions Ja 2447 and 2416^8 and the figures of ibex. Beeston, 1964, 57, pis LIV, 1-2; Jamme, 1972, 40, 48, pis 10, 13. 8 Jabal 'Imjahif The Jabal is about 2.5 km north-west of Mukeiras. Several plates with designs based on graffiti discovered by van Lessen were published by Albert Jamme. Graffiti appear between the pre-Islamic inscriptions Ja 1594-1603. A bowman armed with a sword or dagger is shown beside his camel. The bow is a composite weapon with its characteristic shape. The animal is saddled with a shadãd-saddle (see below). Further pictures published by Jamme (always beside pre-Islamic inscriptions) include a camel-rider, unmounted camels, a gazelle which seems to have twisted horns pointing forwards, and two counterpoised animals facing a central object. Jamme, 1972, 18-21, 35 f., pis 3, 4, 8. 9 Jabal Radac The Jabal is about 6-7 km north-north-west of Mukeiras. The plates published probably show modern graffiti depicting horses, camels and other animals. They have a light patina, in contrast to the dark patina of the pre-Islamic inscriptions nearby. Doe, 1971, 148, pis 68, 69. 10 Jabal al-Mariyah The rock inscriptions and pictures are on a boulder at a place named Rãs Karish Muqilah in the Jabal, west of Karish and about 8 km east-north-east of Mukeiras. The pictures are beside or between pre-Islamic inscriptions Ja 1105-1122, 1130-2 and depict animals, including ibex and perhaps a dog. The pictures are executed in different styles and techniques. Besides animals traced only in outline, there are three ibex, the bodies of which are executed in 's tippling*. Jamme, 1972, 11 f., pl. 1, 20. 1 1 Aqabat al-Ruqub A rock picture showing an ibex with five arrows in its body and hind legs was published by Jamme and Doe. According to Jamme the picture is in the area of Imcâdïyah. According to Doe it is at the pass of al-Ruqub, which is about 24 km north-east of Laudar. Near the Husn at the head of the pass above the wâdi, there are also many rock inscriptions (such as Ja 2370-7). Doe, 1971, pl. 76; Jamme, 1972, 34, pl. 8. 12 Haid al-Mu àqir/ Ansàb (= Nisãb) The site discovered by von Wissmann in 1939 is 'not far north' of Ansâb. A site, Macaqir, is about 1.5 km north of this town and is probably identical to von Wissmann's site.</page><page sequence="7">Map of Southern Yemeni rock art Jung 141 The rock pictures show animal figures such as horses and a camel, some of which are executed in 'stick form*. Further geometric figures (Fig. 3) include circles, half-circles, rectangles, and rectangles with rounded corners. The latter may represent footprints. Höfner, 1952-53, 271-S6, pl. I, nos 1-3, 20-4, 32, pl. II, nos 33-9. Fig. 3. Geometric signs from the Wâdî al-Murùkh (no. 33, 25-31) and from Haid al-Mu ãqir/Ansãb (no. 12, 32, after Höfner, 1952/53, pl. I). 13 9am Surrãn The site is about 10 km north-east of Nisãb. The figurative pictures show footmen, horsemen, some of which are armed with long lances, ibex and camels. One ibex is figured with oversized horns. The figures either have the whole body depicted, or are only outlines, or are of 'stick-form'. Von Wissmann also recorded geometric forms like circles, pairs of circles connected by straight or curved lines ('Brillenbuchstaben') and two rectangles, with short strokes on their upper short side. Similar figures were also found in the Wâdï Yathûf (no. 16, cf. Beeston, 1964, pl. LII, 36) and in the Wãdi Habãbidh/ North Yemen (cf. Jung, 1989, pl. XVIIa, b). They suggest shields or poorly executed representations of footprints (see below). Höfner 1952-53, 271-вб, pl. I, nos 4-1 1, pl. II, nos 40-4, 46, 48-52, 55-8. 13 (a) Ashwa/Nisâb According to Jamme the site is near Nisáb. I could find no place of this name on available maps. Jamme only published a reproduction of the pre-Islamic inscriptions (Ja 890), omitting the pictures illustrated on his photographs. He confined himself to mentioning the 'well known pictures of goats' and the figures of two palm-trees. Jamme, 1962, 233. 14 Ghanam al-Kuffâr/Wàdi Ahwar The site is about 25 km south-south-west of Ahwar. According to Brian Doe's description the site is 'immediately south of the junction of the Wãdi al- Jahr... and the Wâdï Kaiqah, where it widens out south and eastwards and is renamed Wàdï Ahwar1. On the map of the Royal Geographical Society the site is located about 3 km below the junction, on the east side of the Wãdi Ahwar and between the small Wídiãn Bilãs and Baiha. Doe actually distinguishes a northern and a southern site. They consist of the characteristic turret tombs or 'pill-boxes' with stone alignments, rather common in the south of the Arabian Peninsula.2 Cairn no. 1 of the southern site still had six vertical slabs in situ (Fig. 4). A camel-rider is depicted on the inner surface of one of these slabs. Above the camel is</page><page sequence="8">142 Map of Southern Yemeni rock art Jung the pre-Islamic letter W, according to Doe probably a Wasm. As far as I know it is the only example of a rock picture found in connection with these turret tombs. A slab with a pre-Islamic inscription was also discovered between Cairns 1 and 2. Doe, 1971, 177-80, Figs 25-28. Fig. 4. Plan and elevation of the cairn with the graffito of a camel-rider, from Ghanam al-Kuffar (no. 14, after Doe, 1971, Fig. 27). 15 Beitwan Mugraf Saad/ Wàdi Jirdãn South-west of Sacda and north of the track leading from Husn al-Barira is a small Husn on a prominent hill. According to Brian Doe it may have served as an observation post near the pre-Islamic sites al-Binã' and al-Barira. The stone walls of the fort have pre-Islamic inscriptions. Other inscriptions are not far from this small fortification on a flat rock surface. The most remarkable feature there is a shallow recess having the shape and size of a human foot. A circular bowl, about 0.12 m in diameter and 0.06 m deep, is hollowed out beside it. A detailed map of the area of Sacda is given by von Wissmann (1962, pl. Ill, Fig. 1), without any indication of this site. Doe, 1971, 195. 16 Wâdï Yathùf The site, also known as Ahsa al-Kitbah and Shab al-Ghail, is in the small Wàdi Yathuf, a tributary of the Wãdi Jirdãn. About 3 km up this tributary, on the west bank, there is a large bay in the cliffs, about 1 km from the wâdï bed. A great rock lying at an angle of about 40° has fallen from the cliffs on the north side of the bay. Beneath the overhang are many graffiti and paintings. The drawings were mainly in dark and light red ochre. Both colours are sometimes combined with white. At some distance to the west, drawings in dark blue were also found, probably more recent according to Harding. The most interesting figures resemble castles (Fig. 5). Broad outlines in dark red form rectangles which develop on one side into a kind of tower with battlements. They are filled in with white with inscriptions in dark red. In two of the three examples there are dots over the 'tower'. A roughly square field of light red lies at the junction of * tower' and 'wall'. Beeston presumes that these features are connected with water. Harding objects that these figures are like no other known water-signs (cf. no. 5b), adding that there would not have been any water in the surroundings. According to Bafaqih the 'castles' are bee-hives. This opinion is supported by Jan Karpowicz in his</page><page sequence="9">Map of Southern Yemeni rock art Jung 143 article on traditional apiculture in Yemen. Of course one is immediately reminded of the famous rock painting of the Cueva de la Araña (Valencia), which shows female collectors of honey (cf. Lommel, 1974, Fig. 39). Fig. 5. Rock paintings of bee-hives from the Wàdî Yathuf (no. 16, after Beeston, 1964, pl. LU, nos 22-25). Besides the numerous inscriptions, there are groups of men with their names, a scene in which a disguised (?) man wearing feathers (?) approaches a camel from behind, other camels painted in different styles, ibex, a horse and a semi-oval shield-like form. Harding, 1964, 32 s., 50 s.; Beeston, 1964, 51-6; pis LII, 1ЛП; Doe, 1971, pis 91, 92; Bafaqih, 1978; Karpowicz, 1987, 370. 17 Wàdi Salmùn According to Brian Doe this Wâdi is on the west side of the Wâdi Jirdãn. I was unable to find any wãdi of this name near the Wâdi Jirdàn on the maps at my disposal. On the contrary a Wãdi Salmun is indicated farther south not far from cAzzãn. Doe reports a rock shelter the ceiling of which was completely covered in pictures and pre-Islamic inscriptions similar to those of the Wãdi Yathuf. He published only one plate, showing a painting of a feline attacking a camel from behind. Doe, 1971, pl. 93. 18 Jabal Kadur The mountain is about 20 km west of cAzzãn. It is described in detail with a sketch map by Bafaqih (1982). Unlike Freya Stark, this author does not mention any graffiti from the Jabal. Graffiti of ibex executed in rough outlines and also a pre-Islamic inscription are reported from the Jabal. Palaeolithic flint implements were also found there. A careful survey of the site might perhaps reveal an interesting link between the pictures and these flint tools. In some cases, the implements used to make the graffiti have been found in situ (cf. the examples in Anati, 1966). Stark, 1939a, 10 f.; id., 1939b, 491; on the pre-Islamic inscriptions cf. Ryckmans, G., 1939, 309-12, pl. VII. 19 Saiq/Wàdi Maifa'a Saiq is a defile of the Wãdi Maifa'a, about 1 .5 km north of cAzzãn. A great variety of rock pictures was discovered by Freya Stark beside pre-Islamic and Islamic inscriptions. A number are of camels, some of them mounted. In one example two warriors equipped with spear, bow and arrow are shown standing on the neck of the animal.</page><page sequence="10">144 Map of Southern Yemeni rock art Jung A man is fighting against a big feline, probably a lion, according to Stark. The claws of the beast are particularly accentuated. According to Stark's description the hunter is ramming the spear into its jaws. He is holding a shield in the other hand. Ryckmans also recognises a mounted donkey. Its rider seems to be leading a camel on a tether. There is a man on foot with upheld arms. A horse is pictured with saddle and bridle. In this detailed figure, also the eyes, mane, hoofs and muscles are indicated. Stylised ibex and perhaps a hyena are depicted too. There is an interesting graffito of a footprint beside some inscriptions. Stark, 1939a, 10; id., 1939b, 490, pis VI above, VIII below, X; Ryckmans G., 1939, 303-9, pis VII, IX. 10 (a) Site south east of Azzãn The site consists of rocks on the west bank of a wãdi near cAzzãn. The place was called al-Qurn al-Haid and also al-Ghorab, but Harding does not guarantee these names. Besides inscriptions, animal figures including camels were found. In plate LIV one can recognise at least two different styles. One is an unskilled, broadly hammered technique; the other is executed with finely engraved undulating outlines. Harding, 1964, 51; Beeston, 1964, 51, 56 s., pis LII, 37^*3, LIV, 37-40, LVI, 42-3. 20 Wàdî Yib ath The Wãdi Yibcath is a tributary of the Wãdi Rahbe, which flows into the Wãdi Hajar. In the Wãdi, Ingrams discovered representations of pairs of feet, which he compares with similar ones found on the island Socotra, where they are associated with crosses and found in sites believed to be places of ancient Christian worship. Ingrams, 1945, 180. 21 Wãdi Rahbe The Wãdi Rahbe is one of the tributaries of the Wãdi Hajar and flows into it about 12 km west of Sidãrah. The map given by Freya Stark shows two sites of 'rock paintings' in the wãdi. The first site is in the area where the Wïdïan Rahbe, Saiq and Rahm flow together about 36 km west-north-west of Sidãrah. The pictures are under an overhanging rock 'about 25 minutes' below the Kalab-Lijlij track to the left. The pictures are painted in red ochre. They show ibex with long accentuated horns, camel-riders, a man with a kind of turban and three humpless oxen. Freya Stark reports having seen more rock pictures in this Wãdi than in the Wãdi Hadramaut. Stark, 1939a, 8, map facing p. 4; id., 1939b, 486 f., pl. Ш below; on the pre-Islamic inscriptions cf. Ryckmans, G., 1939, 302 f., pl. VIH, which contains some pictures not illustrated in Stark. 22 Husn Ghiutaq/Wádí Rahbe The second site is about 2 km south-east of Husn Ghiutaq, which is about 25 km north-west of Sidãrah. The rock paintings are under the slanting roof of a large boulder, to the south of the track. According to Freya Stark these are in red ochre and show three houses with towers. A close re-examination of the pre-Islamic inscriptions written around these supposed houses would be useful. Probably the figures represent bee-hives as in the examples from the Wãdi Yathuf (no. 16). Stark, 1939b, pl. VI below and the quotations of no. 21.</page><page sequence="11">Map of Southern Yemeni rock art Jung 145 23 Wàdi Hajar In this Wãdi, Mrs Ingrams discovered rock paintings similar to those of Yathuf. Harding, 1964, 50. 24 Surroundings of МаЪаг Ingrams mentions graffiti on the way from Shacbat to МаЪаг and not far north-west of this place in the direction of the ancient paved road al-Majarrah. The rock pictures include figures of ibex, camels, suns and crescent moons, accompanied by pre-Islamic inscriptions. Ingrams, 1945, 181. 25 9am al-Bina'/Bir Asákir The site is about 20 km south-west of Bir cAsakir, which is about 55 km south-west of Shabwa as the crow flies. According to Serjeant the graffiti there are very similar to those in the Hadramaut. Serjeant, 1976, 95, note 109. 26 Wàdi al-Aqäbih The narrow wâdî is about 16 km north-west of al-cAbr and was once an important road. On both sides of the wãdi there are many graffiti and rock inscriptions, of which only a small selection could be recorded by Lankester Harding. The wãdi was also visited by Brian Doe, who published further information. The inscriptions are often accompanied by handprints with outstretched fingers (Fig. 6). These are very numerous and may be enclosed by a line. For example the inscription HYB is followed by seventeen handprints (see below). Fig. 6. Handprints and pre-Islamic in- scription from the Wãdi al-Aqãbih (no. 26, after Beeston, 1964, pl. LV, nos 7 and 8). Two human figures are shown with upraised hands (orants?). The larger one has on a long skirt and strands of hair hanging down. To Beeston both appear to be dancing. Horse-riders are also depicted, some of them armed with long lances and so-called 'water-signs'.

According to von Wissmann' s map for the Geographical Society (1958) the distance is about 20 km.</page><page sequence="12">146 Map of Southern Yemeni rock art Jung The few graffiti reported consist of geometric signs such as strokes, circles and a wavy line. Höfner, 1952-53, 271-86, pl. II, nos 45, 47, 53, 54. 28 Jùja/Shibâm Jüja is about 5 km north-west of Shibãm. The pictures discovered by van der Meulen and Duhm were briefly mentioned in von Wissmann's Landeskunde. He reports graffiti showing an antelope hunt by men equipped with bows and arrows, accompanied by two hounds. Another scene shows an antelope suckling its calf. Caton-Thompson and Gardner report rock inscriptions and animal engravings from a site 'near Shibãm'. Two published photographs of these pictures represent handprints. Rock pictures found in rock shelters in the 'middle Wâdï Hadramauť were briefly mentioned by Huzayyin in a short communication by the Egyptian University Expedition to South- West Arabia. The graffiti were executed both in naturalistic and in schematic styles. According to Huzayyin naturalistic pictures are associated with pre-Islamic inscriptions, which refer mostly to proper names. He thinks these pictures could be connected with the nearby lithic industry. The schematic pictures were probably engraved later. Huzayyin, 1937, 514; Caton-Thompson and Gardner, 1939, 31; Ryckmans G., 1944, 157, 180-4, pl. XX, 3-4; von Wissmann, 1964, 248. 29 Wàdi Jathmah/Saiwún Caton-Thompson and Gardner report rock pictures in the small Wãdi Jathmah, which runs towards Saiwun from the south-south-east. The naturalistic graffiti represent an armed man, mounted and unmounted camels, a mounted donkey (?) and ibex with emphasised horns. Pre-Islamic inscriptions are also reported.

Serjeant, 1976, 25. 30 Aqabe Duqm bel Aswad/ Saiwun Maria Höfner published graffiti from cAqabe Duqm bel Aswad, a site 'along an old way', about 3.5 km south-east of Saiwun. There is a stylised animal figure and geometric signs such as strokes, circles, crosses, a wavy line, and pre-Islamic letters. A square is divided into four smaller squares, which are crossed by diagonals forming symmetrical triangles. Höfner, 1952-53, 271-86, pl. II, nos 59-74, pl. Ш, nos 75-83; cf. also van der Meulen and von Wissmann, 1932, 129. 31 Wàdi Thibï/Tarim The Wàdï Thibï flows about 4 km south of Tarim.</page><page sequence="13">Map of Southern Yemeni rock art Jung 147 Pictures of ibex and palm trees have been discovered. Serjeant thinks that the rocks bearing these graffiti may have been shelters or assembly points for hunters or were even used for circumambulation before or after the hunt. Caton-Thompson and Gardner also mention graffiti around Tarim. Caton-Thompson and Gardner, 1939, 31; Serjeant, 1976, 25, Fig. II. 32 Site near gabr Hùd Rock pictures of ibex (and palms?) can be found in the Wãdi Hadramaut not far below the tomb of the prophet Hud. The rock with the graffiti is at a turn of the wàdï, just before the point where it flows into the Mahrah country. Serjeant, 1976, 25, Fig. II. 33 Wadi al-Murukh The site is at the mouth of the Wädi al-Murukh, where it flows into the Wâdi Jári, south of Bir Terms in the area of the cAwãmir. Geometric forms such as circles with and without central points, strokes, rhombs, wavy lines (Fig. 3), which according to Höfher (p. 272) represent snakes, and stylised animal figures such as ibex are recorded. Among the most interesting figures is a honeycombed form and a rectangle divided by crosslines into sections. I suggested in an earlier article on rock art in the Khawlãn that these and similar figures at other sites represent maps (Jung, 1990, 47-9, Fig. B). Höfner, 1952-53, 271-86, pl. I, nos 12-19, 25-31. 34 Hureida The graffiti are engraved on two slabs found during the excavation of the Moon Temple at Hureida. They are both kept in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. Slab no. 14b was found outside the west corner of the Moon Temple, in the peripheral deposit of an altar-like structure (798.4). It bears an engraving of an unmounted camel and an ostrich. Graffiti of ostrich were also found in Hajar bin Humàyd (no. 5). Slab no. 22 belonged originally to the paving in front of the 0.5 m high circular monolith of Shrine no. 17. The shrine is located near the temple's west corner. The slab shows the engraving of a footprint and pre-Islamic inscriptions, which according to Gertrude Caton-Thompson are partly contemporary. The inscription inside the footprint runs 'Wadďil a tracé'. In the opinion of G. Ryckmans, who translated the inscriptions from Hureida, it may refer to the engraving. The shrines themselves are dated to a Vague post-sixth century вс date' (Caton- Thompson, 59 f.). As they were partly constructed with re-used building materials the slabs may also belong to a previous period. Caton-Thompson, 1944, 53 f., pl. XIX; Ryckmans, G., 1944, 163-в. Subjects depicted The rock pictures of southern Yemen are often described in a very general way in the literature. There are very few illustrations, facsimiles or photographs. This prevents a far-reaching discussion of style, technique and chronology.3 Even so a short review of the subjects depicted can be interesting, especially when compared with the rock art of northern Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula in general.</page><page sequence="14">148 Map of Southern Yemeni rock art Jung The reports of scholars on rock art are often limited to the mere enumeration of the individual subjects. Only occasionally are the figures reported to be involved in scenes. No battle scenes are mentioned at all despite their frequency in northern Yemen. Human figures are shown on foot or riding horses and camels. They are sometimes equipped with weapons like long lances, or with bows and arrows. At the Jabal DImjahif (no. 8) there is a picture of a bowman armed with a composite bow. Shields and daggers seem to be less frequently represented than in northern Yemen, and modern arms like pistols or guns are rarely depicted. In northern Yemen these are quite frequently depicted and there are even pictures of tanks. In some places we have hunting scenes. At Saiq (no. 19) in the Wâdï Malfarà a man is shown fighting a big feline with accentuated claws. One is reminded of the pictures of felines found in the Wãdi Sahtan in Oman (cf. Jäckli, 1980, photographs on pp 19, 22) and in the Wãdi cArayja (Philby, 1939, Fig. on p. 43). Men fighting against felines have also been found in Saudi Arabia (cf. Parr et aí., 1978, pl. ЗОВ; Nayeem, 1990, Fig. 4.29). Some inscriptions (CIH 312, 5; CIH 350; Iryani 21) give an account of the hunting of lions or panthers. The inscription Ingrams I of Aqaba Futura records four panthers, two cheetahs and 600 ibex in the bag of a king of the Hadramaut (cf. Drewes, 1954; Ryckmans, J., 1976, 275, 278, 299). Von Wissmann reports a hunting scene from Juja (no. 28) near Shibãm. Bowmen with hounds are chasing antelopes. Perhaps these pictures are connected with the well-known 'Sacred Hunt' in Southern Arabia (cf. Serjeant, 1976; Ryckmans, 1976; see now Garbini, 1988). Similar scenes have often been discovered in northern Yemen (cf. the notes in Jung, 1990, 42-4). In the Wãdi Salmun (no. 1 7) a feline is shown attacking a camel from behind. An antelope suckling its calf is also reported from Juja (no. 28). Similar 'cow-and-calf motifs are quite frequent in the rock art of Upper Egypt, Nubia and the Libyan desert (cf. the quotations in Červíček, 1986, 83 f.), where they belong to Červíčekfs C-Horizon (ca. 2100-1400 вс). According to Červíček and Kortler (1979, 230 f., Fig. 36) such a picture also appears at the Jabal Ligashir in northern Yemen. The cow-and-calf motif is also widespread in other art- forms in the Middle East (cf. Matthiae, 1962), where it seems to be much more frequent than in the rock art of Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula in general.4 At three sites (nos 3, 19, 26) men with upraised arms have been reported. Such figures are often called *orants' as it is supposed that they are in praying posture. This term has been adopted from the classical art of Rome and Greece and especially from Early Christian art.5 In rock art these figures are depicted standing or in movement, 'dancing'. Often the hands are outstretched, large and overemphasised. Figures of these Grants' were also found in several sites in northern Yemen, such as in the Safir region (cf. Farah, 1985, 4), in the Wãdi Habábidh (cf. Jung, 1991c, Fig. 10; cf. here, Plate I) and recently also in the Jawf at al-Aqshic (Robin, 1991-3, Fig. 3 on p. 16). The *orans' from the Jabal ^Awrãd/Wãdi Bayhán (no. 3, Fig. 2) would be of particular interest, if the figure is really connected with the inscription (Ja 863) directly below. The inscription tells us that Sharhum, he of (the family) of Barium, respects and protects in obedience to Dhat-H(imyam). The interest is twofold. First, the inscription seems to be dedicated to Dhât- Himyãm, the Sabaean sun goddess (on the divinity, cf. Höfner, 1965, 529 f.). Orants associated with solar divinities are also known in Roman and Egyptian art. Second, the inscription appears to express a concept of duty toward God and Man quite close</page><page sequence="15">Map of Southern Yemeni rock art Jung 149 to the Roman Pietas. Generally the Roman orants are considered to be the Pietas, as represented on Roman coins with a female orant and the inscriptions Pietas , Pietas Publica, Pietas Augusta and so forth (cf. Bertelli, 1963, 704 f.). Červíček supposes that the 4orants' in north African and Arabian rock art 'possibly reflect Shamanic practices... practised by the prehistoric populations of these regions' (Červíček, 1978-79, 11). The meaning and implications of this praying posture have been subject to many changes in time and space. A close evaluation of all published presumed pictures of orants in the rock art of the Arabian Peninsula will be the subject of a future study (Jung b). Graffiti of handprints have been reported from three sites in southern Yemen, from the Jabal Khudra near Hajar bin Humãyd (no. 5c), from the Wãdi al-Aqãbih (no. 26, Fig. 6) and from a site 'near Shibánť (cf. no. 28). A number of them are below or beside short pre-Islamic inscriptions with personal names. Hands and inscriptions are often enclosed by a line. Rock pictures of hands are quite common in northern Yemen (cf. Jung, 1991b, 47 f.). In Saba, the hand was probably the sign of the god ^HTR (cf. Höfner, 1965, 508 f.) and had an apotropaic significance. The hand has kept this meaning until today in Islamic countries (cf. Kriss and Kriss-Heinrich, 1962, keywords *Hanď, 'Hand- amulette', 4Hand der Fátima', etc.). Doe (1971, 236) proposes that the handprints of the Wãdí al-Aqãbih (no. 26) are an indication of distance, or the number of the camels of a particular caravan, and enhance the name written nearby. Pictures of footprints were discovered at four sites (nos 12, 15, 19 and 20) in southern Yemen. They are also reported at several sites in northern Yemen (cf. Jung, 1991b, 48 f. and passim). These figures are quite a common feature in many prehistoric cultures, and are frequent also in Egypt and the Greco-Roman world. Laszlo Castiglione (1970, 1971) made a thorough study of this motif in Egypt, Nubia and India. According to him 'its most general sense is the immortalization of the presence of a certain person in some place. This basic meaning was frequently expanded, and thus the picture of the footprint frequently represented a certain person or deity - pars pro toto - also in his fullness. It was often used as a symbol of property and fairly frequently it eternalized the place of the appearance or the departure of a mythical being* (Castagnoli, 1971, 25; see also Jung, 1991b, 48 f. with bibliographic notes). At Beitwan Mugraf Sacad in the Wãdi Jirdán (no. 15) a similar footprint is accompanied by a circular bowl carved in the rock. This cuphole underlines the religious meaning of the graffito. Sacrificial blood, milk or food were possibly once poured into it. This association between footprint and cuphole is widespread in the Middle East and Europe.6 Camels, horses, ibex, antelope, gazelle, dogs, ostrich, humpless oxen, felines and perhaps a hyena are the animals depicted in the southern Yemeni rock art. Horses, camels and ibex appear to be the animals depicted most often, as in northern Yemen. The horns of the ibex, the animal of the moon god ^LMQH, are sometimes exaggerated, as at Qarn Surrán (no. 13). The horns signify divine power, strength and protection.7 The camels are pictured mounted (Fig. 4) or without rider. At the Jabal 3Imjahif (no. 8) a camel is clearly figured with a shadãd saddle. The published pictures of camels and camel-riders in northern Yemen are more informative. The three possible riding postures are there represented: in front of, behind and upon the camel- hump. The riding posture depends on the development of the camel-saddle. The transition</page><page sequence="16">150 Map of Southern Yemeni rock art Jung from half-bedoulnism to full bedouinism hinges on tills development in the minds of some scholars (cf. Dostal, 1958, 1959; on the Yemeni examples, see now Jung a). Figures of palm trees are reported from southern Yemen (nos 1 За, 3 1 and possibly 32). Similar figures are completely absent in northern Yemen. Palms, sometimes with men collecting dates, are figured in the rock art of Oman (cf. Preston, 1976, pl. 22) and Saudi Arabia (cf. Ingraham et ai, 1981, pl. 96A). Some rock paintings in the Wádi Yathuf (no. 16, Fig. 5, cf. also no. 22) are shaped like castles with towers. Dots are shown over two of these 'castles'. Some years ago Bafaqih (1978) read a paper at the Seminar on these pictures. According to him and Karpowicz (1987, 370) the castles represent bee-hives and the dots are bees. Geometric signs like strokes, dots, circles, squares, discs and wavy lines were discovered in a number of places (nos 12, 13, 27, 30 and 33, Fig. 3). Their meaning is unclear. Some of them are probably wusum (sg. wasm) = tribal signs, signs of property, cf. Littmann, 1904). Others may have a religious-magical significance (see the thorough discussion in Höfner, 1952-53). These geometric signs are also depicted at a number of northern Yemeni sites (cf. Jung, 1990, 45-9, Figs A, B, pis VII-X; see here Plates II, III).8 In short, today we still have only a poor idea of southern Yemeni rock art. I have tried to summarise all the information on this subject. I hope that the catalogue and the map presented to the Seminar will be helpful for future studies. Acknowledgements I would like to express here my gratitude to Professor Alessandro de Maigret, who gave me the opportunity to take part in the research of the Italian Archaeological Mission of the IsMEO in Yemen; and to Professor Umberto Scerrato for his generous help during the writing of the manuscript. I thank Dr Helen Ampt, Dr Paolo Comba, Dr Anna- Valeria Jervis and Wolfgang Bartoschek for their kind advice. I am most grateful, moreover, to my parents for their constant support. Notes 1 On the rock art ofSaudi Arabia see the literature cited in Jung, 1989, 271, note 1; 1991b, passim; further Khan, 1988; Nayeem, 1990, 89-1 16; Le Quellee and Cervíček, 1991; on Jordan, cf.

Hawkins, 1987; Facey 1987. 2 On turret tombs, see the recent excavations of the Italian Archaeological Mission of IsMEO in Silbàm al-Radãci/Khawlàn and al-Makhdara near Sirwãh; cf. Activities, 1983, 343, Figs 56, 57; de Maigret, 1986, 388-94, Figs 18-24; id., 1991. 3 Research of the French Archaeological Mission near Sacda has provided data that finally have improved the chronology of northern Yemeni rock art, cf. Garcia et aí., 1991 ; Garcia and Rachad, 1991; see also Rachad, 1986--87. 4 If photographic documentation or drawings of the graffiti were available, different motifs usually all considered under the definition of *cow-and-calf motif, such as cow-and-calf standing simply side by side or the cow giving suck to its calf, could be distinguished. Each of these motifs has its own meaning, if one admits that rock pictures often have more than a simple narrative character. The cow turning back its head towards the suckling calf is a motif frequently found cut in ivory, depicted on cylinder seals or executed in relief in Egypt, Syria and Mesopotamia, cf. Matthiae's iconographie study (1962). 5 The 'orans' is one of the most frequent motifs in the fresco decorations of the Roman catacombs (cf. Stützer, 1983, 62-8). The Christian 'orans' originates, at least formally, from Roman and Greek models going back to the fourth century вс (statue of Artemisia in Halicarnassus). There is also</page><page sequence="17">Map of Southern Yemeni rock art Jung 151 a passage in Pliny, in which he writes that Euphranor, Boedas and Sthennis had created •adorantes1 (Nat. hist. XXXIV, 73, 78, 90). 6 cf. The examples in Qatar (Hawkins, 1987, 54 f., Fig. 5); in Petra (Dalman, 1908, 190, Fig. 112); in Upper Egypt (Červíček, 1986, photograph 22). For Europe see the magnificent 'Pierre aux Pieds* at Lanslevillard/ Savoia (Seglie, 1987, photograph on p. 96). Between Yerim and Dhamar/ North Yemen Burchardt ( 1902, 606) found a footprint, called Dáset Ali, which was smeared in with fat by the Bedouins as sign of veneration. On cupholes see the bibliographic notes in Jung, 1990, 49. I am grateful to Michael Macdonald for his helpful letter of 18 June 1991, in which he gave me much useful information on footprints in southern Jordan. 7 On the ibex in Yemeni art and religion, see the notes in Jung, 1989, 283 f., 1990, 42-44. Potts has recently published interesting 'Notes on some horned buildings in Iran, Mesopotamia and Arabia' (1990) in the Revue d'Assyrialogie. He also briefly mentions Southern Arabian examples. One can add more ancient and more modern examples from northern Yemen. At al-cAmàs/ Jabal Qutrãn the IsMEO expedition excavated a neolithic construction. One of its stones showed a relief carving of five pairs of ram horns, one on the top of the other (photograph in Jung, 1991b, pl. Vllb; on the Yemeni neolithic, cf. de Maigret et al., 1988, 18-23). Anyone who has visited the beautiful old quarters of San^ or Sacda knows that the custom of fixing horns of ibex and other animals on the roof is still alive today in Yemen (see e.g. Varanda, 1982, photograph on p. 70). Examples from southern Yemen are illustrated in Stark, 1938, photographs on pp. 37 f. 8 I cautiously suggested that similar geometric signs on a boulder in the Wàdî cUsh, northern Yemen, represent a 'star-map' (Jung, 1990, 46; see here, Plate III). 9 My thanks go to Dr Paolo Comba, Brookline, Massachusetts, who kindly examined the signs for their supposed astronomic content. In Comba's opinion, unfortunately, no positive statement can be made in this regard. Bibliography Activities, 1983.
