<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sidney E. Mead's Tragic Theology of the Republic J. Ronald Engel The fanaticism of all parties must be allowed to burn down to ashes, like a fire out of control. If it survives, it will be only because it will have humanized itself, reduced its dogmas to harmless metaphors, and sunk down a tap-root, to feed it, into the dark damp depths of mother earth. The economy of nature includes all particular movements, combines and transforms them all, but never diverts its wider processes to render them obedient to the prescriptions of human rhetoric. Things have their day, and their beauties in that day. It would be preposterous to expect any one civilization to last forever. George Santayana, "My Host the World"' idney E. Mead is both historian and seer of the American democratic faith. Over the past two decades his essays have given to many students of American history what Ralph Barton Perry's Puritanism and Democracy and Ralph Gabriel's The Course of American Democratic Thought gave to earlier generations.2 They have provided grounds for belief in the enduring greatness of the Enlightenment ideal of the "Republic" in spite of the conditions of the twentieth century. Even when liberal hopes for a new dispensation of hum.an fraternity gave way late in the 1960s to bitterness and defeat, Mead's portrayal of the "Republic of our agrarian dream " performed a redemptive function. He is one of a very few who had the literary capacity to link his contemporaries with the immortals of the Revolutionary age and the deathless, if futile, vision they beheld. While Mead has been richly celebrated for his contributions to the "recovery" of American religious history as the foundation for an understanding of American culture,3 his constructive theological role as an apologist for the "Republic" has gone uncriticized. It does not matter that the role was assumed reluctantly, or - as Mead himself would insist - by default, because of the failure of 'George Santayana, Persons and Places (3 vols.; New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1953), vol.3, p. 144. 2Ralph Barton Perry, Puritanism and Democracy (New York: Vanguard Press, 1944); Ralph Gabriel, The Course of American Democratic Thought (New York: Ronald Press, 1956). 3Mead's contributions to the writing of American religious history are summarized by Jerald C.

RONALD ENGEL professional theologians and philosophers of religion to shoulder their proper responsibility. The result is that, through and beyond his historiography, Mead has developed a systematic perspective on the American democratic faith which can be described most accurately as tragic. This attempt to give an interpretation of the ultimate meaning of American history well may be, in retrospect, the most significant aspect of his work; at the least it ought to be recognized as a major source of his immense influence within and beyond the historical disciplines. Clearly, there is a need for a delineation of Mead's tragic theology of the "Republic" and some initial attempt at an evaluation of its adequacy. That Mead's work taken as a whole embodies a structure, a philosophy of history and a theology of religious experience which may be fittingly described as tragic, will be the task of the main body of this essay to demonstrate. Two things need to be explained at the outset, however: first, how it is that in pursuing such a task I am not imposing my interests upon Mead and in some fashion doing violence to his intentions as an historian; and second, the definition of tragedy on the basis of which I am characterizing his vision. In fact, Mead is quite explicit about the philosophical and valuative dimensions of his historiography. The subject matter of the "religion of the Republic" is fundamentally theological in nature: Of course it may be assumed that the civil authorities in adjudicating the differences between "ecclesiastical bodies" must have some guidelines, presumably rooted in some conception of the nature of man and his relation to the cosmos in which he finds himself. The philosophical and/or theological context implied here I call the "religion of the Republic."4 At the least, Mead thinks of himself as a historian of the theology or theologies of the democratic faith. But beyond this, Mead understands the writing of history itself to be a constructive theological enterprise. The basis of the historian's interpretation of facts is his own conception of the "culmination of the story" he is telling: The historian's selection of what to emphasize in the past depends upon his conception of the end and culmination of the story he wishes to tell - which story is itself selected from a practically infinite number of possible stories. The selection of which story to tell depends upon the historian's decision on what constitutes the norm of human experience in any historical epoch. Thus every written history is at least implicitly a reasoned defense of the faith of the historian: "This means that the basic differences between historians . . . are theological and/or philosophical and cannot be resolved by historical methods."5 "The end and culmination of the story"Mead wishes to tell, and for the sake of which he develops his theological/ philosophical categories, is tragic in character. I make this judgment on the basis of four key elements in Edmond LaB. Cherbonnier's explication of the idea of tragedy: (1) that "truth resides in the Whole," (2) that the relation of the whole to its parts or "God to the world is properly expressed as that of the infinite to the finite" or the absolute to the relative, (3) that hybris, the "absolutizing of the relative," is the cause of man's 4Sidney E.

Over the course of thirty-five years of productive scholarship, Mead's tragic vision has become increasingly cosmic in scope. The following two sections seek to retrace that evolution in his thought. What begins as the tragic inability of organized religion to affirm the "whole"of humanity ends as the tragic hybris of the human species itself unable to make peace with the encompassing nature of which it is only a finite part. THE REPUBLIC OF HUMANITY In the first chapter of The Nation with the Soul of a Church, "In Quest of America's Religion," Mead establishes the dialectic of the "infinite" and the "finite" as definitive for the relation between the divine and the human. The first principle to which "every religion points" is that "no man is God": This is what I understand to be the functional meaning of God in human experience. Whatever God may be - if indeed being is applicable to God - a concept of the infinite seems to me necessary if we are to state the all-important fact about man: that he is finite.7 For Mead, the human recognition of mortality is the crux of the religious quest: To know where we are and whither tending religiously is not easy. Even a modicum of confidence that we are following a charted course to some destination other than dusty death, rests upon an unstable foundation of knowledge, faith and desire.8 The quest for the divine is a quest for transcendence, or as Mead frequently refers to it, a quest for "identity" by identification with something which surpasses the individual's brief span of existence. By faithful identification with That which is truly infinite, men overcome the despair of their mortality and learn to make peace with their transient particularity. The assumption that the only notion of the infinite Reality that can provide a saving religious identity for mortal man is one which refers to immensity, universality, and permanence in space and time places Mead firmly within the Enlightenment tradition of the democratic faith.9 The first principle of the 6Edmond LaB.

RONALD ENGEL Enlightenment was universalism: the belief that whatever is true in matters of faith and morals must be true for all men and verifiable by all men. Whether by an appeal to the "consensus gentium" or the single "pure light of nature" in each individual's mind or heart, it sought to move beyond the unique and changing to the common and permanent. When Mead set out in 1953 to write an "American church history that is to rise above denominationalism," he articulated the Enlightenment perspective of the priority of the whole over its parts.'0 For Mead, the infinite One may be found in two interrelated places: in actual inclusive communities which persist through time and gather into their membership all who share a common origin and destiny, and in universal ideals of community which embrace a variety of more particular notions and constitute the core belief-structures of historic societies. The greater the size and permanence of one's actual community in space, and especially time, and the greater the universality of the ideal of what that community ought to be, the greater the opportunity for the individual to develop a stable and saving identity with the infinite." The mythic name Mead gives to the actual/ideal transcendent community is the "Republic." The first story of the "Republic" with which he is concerned - the Republic of Humanity - began in Stoic-Christianity and reached its culmination in the eighteenth-century American "religion of the Republic." If the dialectic of the infinite and the finite, the One and the Many, is the crux of Mead's theology of the "Republic," the central metaphor of the philosophy by which he seeks to grasp its history is evolutionary. It hinges upon understanding "community" in terms of the generic individual-species relationship. Indeed, so basic is this biological metaphor to his thought, that in certain respects his account of the unfolding of the myth of the "Republic" over the past two millennia may be perceived as the explicit development of the structure of the metaphor itself. The argument I want to make is that the internal structure of Mead's constructive position, his ontology, is to be found in this combination of the infinite-finite contrast and the individual-species metaphor. In a 1968 article, "Prospects for the Church in America," Mead spells out his evolutionary interpretation of the Christian doctrine of the incarnation as the Republic of Humanity and its culmination in the central tenets of the American "religion of the Republic."'2 Interestingly enough, by Mead's account, the Christ- event only makes clear what was taught to man in the Garden of Eden. Once having eaten of the tree of knowledge of past and future, Adam knew that as an individual "he shall surely die." But at the same time, the serpent (who in Mead's Mead's thought follows the elements, e.g., uniformitarianism, rationalistic individualism, cosmopolitanism, intellectual equalitarianism, which Lovejoy identifies. Furthermore, as shown below, Mead's constructive position is aimed at a development in terms of evolutionary philosophy of two leading traits of Deism - the continuity of Christianity and the religion of democracy, and the role of "nature" in the determination of the form and content of religion itself. I'Mead, "Professor Sweet's Religion and Culture in America," Church History, 22 (March, 1953), p. 46. Italics added. I" ... the larger, the more massive, inclusive and persistent in time, is the 'community' to which one relates - in brief, the more it transcends all the vicissitudes of man's day-by-day experiences, the stronger and more stable will be his sense of personal identity."

Individual men, in their finitude, as "unique self-conscious creatures," live out their lives in the constant knowledge of their dissolution. In this they believe the Creator. As participants in the community of "mankind," however, they have the hope of survival beyond death - "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Christ, whose death was swallowed up in victory, revealed the hope of this kind of "generic survival" which Mead calls "Christian optimism." It follows that the ideal of the Church which took his name is the cosmopolitan notion of "a single, organic, society which transcended and included 'all earlier distinctions"'of mankind. 3 The American "religion of the Republic" inherited the fundamental principle of Christian salvation and enshrined it as the premise of its New World revolutionary creed: "all men are created equal," i.e., all men are equally finite before the infinite God. But the "religion of the Republic" carried the principle one step further by analogizing the relationship between individuals and the species humanity with the relationship between particular religions and the universal religious identity which embraces and transcends them all: "'a particular religion' is analogous to the particular individual who shall'surely die,' while 'the religious' is the generic entity that 'shall not surely die' and may indeed 'overcome.''4 Thus every individual religion can contemplate its death while the species in which it participates will live on. This ontology is the source of Mead's claim that the "religion of the Republic" is theonomous, standing over against all idolatrous tendencies. All men and all religions are finite and correct one another. The fundamental principle is the same in its Christian and New World embodiments. In Christianity, "the sin of sins is the refusal to accept one's finite state and be truly man."'5 The fundamental conviction of the "religion of the Republic "is "Remember, you too are mortal."'6 The critical difference between Christianity and the Enlightenment faith of the American founders is that in the latter the metaphor of generic inclusiveness achieves a higher culmination by embracing all religions as well as all races and nations and thus, in truth, all humanity. In keeping with the rhetoric of the Jeffersonian tradition, Mead frequently uses the term, "the people," to designate the transcendent community of humanity as the object of faith for the "religion of the Republic." In one of his first articles, published in 1948, and entitled just that, "The People," Mead argues on behalf of a chastened liberalism that we ought to look upon history from the standpoint of the "little people." While the "big people strut and die" (flout their finitude), the "little people" have unbroken continuity across space and time (as participants in infinite community). The "great amorphous body" of "little people" is the living communal embodiment of God: 13Mead, The Nation with the Soul of a Church, p. 49. 14Mead, "Prospects for the Church in America," p. 5. Cf. Mead, The Nation with the Soul ofa Church, pp. 115-16: "But now, in our pluralistic societies since the eighteenth century, the word 'religion' points to a genus in which there are thousands of different species, each with its own peculiar protective institutional shell."

RONALD ENGEL The voice of the people is the voice of God . . . The continuity, the moral structure, the massive inertia of the people is in the long run the great equilibrator of mankind, the rock on which all inequalities and injustices finally break. The "big people" attain lasting significance only insofar as they create values to be disseminated among the "little people." Democracy is synonymous with the question: "Are you using such gifts as you possess for or against 'the people'?"'7 Thus it is in the Enlightenment interpretation of the democratic faith, through its acceptance of the operational meaning of God as the sovereignty of "the people," that the image of the universal community as the Republic of Humanity became most explicit in Western history. It is against the background of this theological and philosophical structure that Mead presents his story of the tragic outcome of the democratic faith in America. Because the United States had the perspective of the "religion of the Republic" embedded in its legal agreements at its founding, it has led the other institutions of the society in embodying the universal communal ideal.18 "America," the "nation with the soul of a church," becaxe an intermediate "class," somewhere between the discrete individual and the species collectivity, the whole of humanity, which it was dedicated to exemplify. The promise of denominationalism in this framework was the hope that each individual religion brought to these shores would transcend itself and seek, before it died, to disclose how in the depths of its particular form resided the ideal of one humanity covering one globe. The "something wholly new," to which Mead often refers in an updating of Philip Schaff, was the potential emergence in the New World of a collective faith of a higher universality than even that to which Christianity aspired. But this promise has not been fulfilled. Within Protestantism, the dominant right-wing Reformation denominations, especially, have failed to see their specific religious forms as sub-species of a more inclusive religious faith and themselves as partial embodiments of the American democratic community. Indeed, they and their fellow denominations of every creed now constitute the very antithesis of the kind of religious community Mead's perspective prescribes: Any one "church" in our society is too small, too circumscribed in time and space, too droopy in its thinking, too competitive, too involved in its own survival, to offer a plausible claim even to point to the transcendent community necessary for the achievement of . . . identity.'9 By rejecting the "religion of the Republic," by claiming to uniquely represent infinite Deity, by - in a word - falling prey to the hybris of "sectarianism," the American churches have betrayed their spiritual trust. They have committed the '7Mead, "The People," C T.S. Register, 39 (January, 1949), pp. 22-23. '8Two of the essays included in Mead, The Nation with the Soul ofa Church, "Neither Church nor State: Reflections on James Madison's 'Line of Separation'" and "Religion, Constitutional Federalism, Rights, and the Court," are devoted to showing how constitutionally this is true. At the root of Mead's approach to the reading of the Constitution, however, is his own presupposition "that the 'bonds of affection' which bind all the heterogeneous people together in such a union must somehow be more cosmopolitan, more universal, more general, than the 'bonds of affection' which bind a particular group of these people together in a particular voluntary association, even though it be called a church."

They have absolutized the relative. Intellectually, this sin has expressed itself in their failure to contribute to a theology of the "Republic." But it is in the realm of faith and works that their apostasy has had its gravest consequences. They have created a society divided against itself because it is divided into two religions - the "religion of the Republic" and the "religion of the [sectarian] denominations." It is with this crucial spiritual dilemma of American life that the essays gathered in the two collections, The Lively Experiment and The Nation with the Soul of the Church, leave the reader. But this is by no means Mead's whole story. THE REPUBLIC OF NATURE Sometime between 1948 and the early '60s, Mead became dissatisfied with the image of Humanity as the content for the transcendent community of identity and convinced that the ideals which previously motivated the American "religion of the Republic" no longer spoke with "power."20 The basic cause of this shift in position may be found in a further development of the implications of his underlying vision, although the occasions for this development are perceived by Mead as historical. In 1945 a change in the meaning of human mortality occurred through the discovery of the atomic bomb. This event, compounded by the destructive consequences of other technological feats since, has destroyed the Enlightenment faith that God is incarnate in humanity and consequently immortal as posterity is immortal.21 Bertrand Russell and his religion of "the whole human race as one cooperative unity" was an example of the Enlightenment faith carried into the twentieth century, but now "it should be obvious that Russell's community, although it included the 'whole human race,' is not inclusive enough or secure enough to guarantee one a stable and secure identity."22 But 1945 was only the coup degrace. While tangible empirical evidence for the loss of faith in humanity as the transcendent community of permanence and continuity in time was only apparent recently, the spiritual occasion for the loss of faith in humanity as a universal ideal occurred a century ago. In "American History as Tragic Drama," Mead argues that the outcome of the era when "wise men hoped" was clear by the end of the Civil War. By then most Americans sensed what the ninety-six communitarian experiments launched prior to 1860 had already discovered, that somehow man was incapable of achieving a social embodiment of the high ideal of the "Republic": "a self-transcending nation 'conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."' American history is best understood as a tragic drama (in the modern 20An important new influence upon Mead early in this period was Ross Lockridge's novel, Raintree County (Boston : Houghton Mifflin, 1948). Raintree County imaginatively portrays the loss of the dream of the American Republic through the life of its protagonist, John Wickliff Shawnessy. Lockridge's epic novel is the ever present mythic background to Mead's mature perspective. 21Mead, "The Lost Dimension and the Age of Longing," p. 12. Mead closes The Nation with the Soul of a Church with a brief "Epilogue" which begins: "I have written these pieces with the chilling realization that we live today under the shadow of man's power to destroy all life on this planet ... I agree with Arthur Goldberg that probably man now has less than a fifty percent chance of survival," p. 127. This observation is a pervasive theme in Mead's recent writings. 22Mead, "History and Identity," p. 11.</page><page sequence="8">162 J. RONALD ENGEL sense) because the "catastrophic end of the action is . . . a result of the free working out of flaws in the individual's character," because of "some flaw inherent in the nature of the medium itself - in other words, a flaw in the available material, in 'the people."' American man became aware of his finitude as a moral category: the insufficiency of his character as a finite creature to embody his master ideal. As a consequence the ideal itself lost "power," and the United States entered a period of long and slow decline.23 Which is to say that by virtue of the American experiment "on behalf of all humanity," mankind found itself as a species incapable of effectively entertaining the principle that "no man is God." Not only the denominations, then, but mankind itself, are shown to be incurably sectarian! It is a short step from here to Mead's most recent despair over the future of the human species and his acceptance of the characterization of man as a "planetary disease."24 If Mead could still write convincingly during the last decade of the ideals of the "religion of the Republic," it is because this faith embodied what ought to be true of humanity. "Truth resides in the whole." Yet in finite historical existence we have learned that the ontological truth cannot be realized. Those persons who live by it in spite of that knowledge are the tragic heroes of the faith. Increasingly in the last decade, Mead has looked beyond the human species to "Nature and Nature's God" for the transcendent community of identity. Only the natural universe, the "mythology of modern man," appears to have enough immensity, universality, and permanence in time to manifest the infinite. Loren Eiseley supersedes Jefferson, Lincoln, and Augustine as a religious seer: The modern's analogy to the traditional "city of God," wherein "neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through or steal" (Matt. 6:20), is reared on the presupposition of unbroken continuity in the universe through billions of years, and must include not only all "living" things but all "inorganic" matter as well ... Finally, I am trying to suggest that the modern can find a stable identity only in the context of unimaginable time, as he senses a mystical unity with all of life on its "immense journey."25 What is enduring in its power as well as its longevity is the primordial chaos. It alone is immortal, and it alone holds the key to a transcendent identity which can make men free. Mead's second chapter in the story of the Enlightenment faith is not a departure, but a conclusion, from his fundamental perspective. That perspective is 23Mead, "American History as Tragic Drama," The Journal of Religion, 52 (1972), pp. 359, 337, 342. Mead's conclusion that this was indeed the "outcome" of the first century of the American Republic is based in part upon a theory of history as a work of art derived from Dorothy Sayers. What is instructive about this theory is that it brings into relief Mead's presuppositions regarding the relations between the ideal and the actual and the human activity which seeks to unite them. Human reason is the contemplation, or "beholding" of an "eternal" ideal. Natural fact is the "medium," the "bonds of matter," which has a "stubborn integrity of its own and resists being used and shaped." Creative human activity is a matter of shaping the matter to meet the demands of the eternal idea: "A history results from the imposition of a creative mind on primordial chaos - the vast amorphous, unbroken biological continuity of the human race" (p. 338). 24Mead quotes Loren Eiseley to this effect in "Not in Our Stars but Ourselves," Address delivered at the Meadville/ Lombard Theological School 125th Anniversary Commencement, June 9, 1970, Chicago, Illinois. 25Mead, "History and Identity," p. 11.</page><page sequence="9">MEAD'S TRAGIC THEOLOGY OF THE REPUBLIC 163 rooted in a dialectic whereby men seek to overcome their finitude through participation in a community which is enduring in time - in fact and in ideal. Humanity as a species entity and the ideals of human social harmony which take that entity as their object - once perceived by the "religion of the Republic" as the answer to the religious quest - have been proven by the experiment of American history to be tragically inadequate. Humanity can now easily and abruptly pass into oblivion, and the ideals of an equalitarian society are too weak to energize the very people who once held them with such fervent devotion, The only community with any justified hope for survival in which men can participate is "nature" itself, organic and inorganic, and it is to this community of common creatureliness that Mead finally turns as his proferred content of the "Republic." This is the culmination of "the tendency in world history" which "for a long, long time has been toward the erasure of all sectarian religious differences and the emergence of an inclusive and universal religious outlook."26 CITIZENSHIP IN THE REPUBLIC Perhaps the greatest tribute that can be paid to Sidney Mead is to say that he has assumed the theological responsibility of citizenship in the American Republic. For some decades now, Mead has waged a lonely struggle on behalf of the need of the churches to come to terms with the theological grounds of their New World freedom in Enlightenment thought. His most direct challenge to the Protestant churches is found in "The Post-Protestant Concept and America's Two Religions."27 In debate with church sociologists and historians, Will Herberg, Martin Marty and Winthrop Hudson, who in the 1950s were seeking a transcendent source of judgment of American cultural religion in a renewal of the prophetic Biblical heritage, Mead argues that there is an authentic religious principle resident in the American ethos itself and that this principle holds any and all confessional particularities accountable. Further, it is the responsibility of the churches to articulate, each in its own way, that universal religious principle. For Mead consistently to take such a position in the context of the American religious situation has involved serious apologetic obligations.28 In the first place, Mead is obliged to demonstrate that there does in fact exist in the American ethos, distinct from the idolatrous "American way of life," a definable theological tradition that is "a genuinely religious alternative to orthodox Christianity."29 And in the second place, if the tradition he points to is to be more than a formal principle of criticism and actually inform culture (as his 26Mead, "Tending: Whether or Whither," Journal of the Liberal Ministry, 6 (Winter, 1966), pp. 5-6. 27Ch. 2 of Mead, The Nation with the Soul of a Church. 28It might be said that Mead has assumed with regard to Protestantism the same kind of an apologetic task, on behalf of the Enlightenment tradition, that John Courtney Murray assumed with regard to Catholicism, and Horace Kallen with regard to Judaism. See John Courtney Murray, S.J., We Hold These Truths (New York: Sheed and Ward,1960), and Horace Kallen, Secularism is the Will of God (New York: Twayne Publishers, 1954). From the other side of the debate, Martin Marty has recently argued that apologists for the churches have the burden of showing that "civil religion" is denominationalized and denominations are also devoted to the common. See Marty's "Churches Behaving Civilly," Fides et Historia, 7 (Spring, 1975), pp. 2-10. 29Mead, The Nation with the Soul of a Church, p. 119.</page><page sequence="10">164 J. RONALD ENGEL favorite dictum of Tillich - "religion is the substance of culture" - indicates it should), he is obliged to demonstrate the relevance of this tradition to the substantial public issues of his age. One way to approach an internal critique of Mead's tragic theology of the "Republic" is to appraise its adequacy as an instrument for the discharge of these obligations. 1. By casting the American Enlightenment faith in the mold of a tragic vision, Mead has touched a deep stream in the Western tradition. Mead's particular tragic outlook, identifying the whole-part relationship with the infinite-finite contrast, must be understood as only one current within this larger stream. Broadly conceived, I am referring to that movement of thought and feeling which has sought to be both inclusively "humanistic" and "religious." As "naturalistic," it has affirmed a continuity between the ends of humanity and the realization of all other aspects of nature by virtue of an inherent natural law or shared teleology of cosmic harmony. As "humanistic," it has attempted to embrace figures as various as Socrates, Jesus, Jefferson and Lincoln by a relational or communal vision of our common humanity - a vision that transcends any individual exemplification or mode of understanding because it is inclusive of a variety of exemplifications and a variety of modes of understanding and is richer because of that variety. As "religious," it has insisted upon an ultimate unity for the divine life - a single "principle" or Creator working within and beyond all creatures. At the core of this stream of thought is a double consciousness of tragedy: the inevitable tragedy necessitated by the transiency of all finite perfections (Whitehead's "tragic beauty") and the unneeded tragedy occasioned by humanity's willful refusal to accept a universal unity in diversity. Mead has opened the way for a new appraisal of the American "religion of the Republic" as a continuation of this distinct and genuine religious tradition in Western life and thought. 2. Mead has placed the spiritual center of the modern age at the intersection of our common humanity and the natural universe. And he has insisted that at this intersection, nature is and ought to be an "end" of human action. Indeed, because of the tragic flaw in the human character which assures the transiency of the species, it is ultimately the only worldly end worth pursuing. "Human life is the planet become conscious of itself," and in that consciousness it holds the capacity to choose between life or death for all earth's creatures.30 To Mead the issue of issues before us is the quality of our relation as rational beings to the "nature" within us and without. I don't think it can be gainsaid that Mead has here grasped an issue of ultimate seriousness in our common life. If there is currently a substantive issue at stake between the natural theology of the Enlightenment and the "religion of the denominations," this comes close to focusing it. Finally, it is not sectarianism in a formal sense - the failure to universalize the inherited spiritual content of the churches - that Mead rejects with such feeling. Rather, it is sectarianism in the material sense - the anthropomorphism of popular Christianity so evident in the lack of regard for "God's second volume of revelation, the Creation" - that disturbs him so deeply.31 And whatever its weaknesses in other respects, in this particular, the Enlightenment was firm: "nature" provides not only the opportunity for human action; it provides norms as well. 3'Mead, "History and Identity," p. 20. 31Mead, The Nation with the Soul of a Church, p. 118.</page><page sequence="11">MEAD'S TRAGIC THEOLOGY OF THE REPUBLIC 165 Given the trenchancy of Mead's perception of the issue, the question must still be asked, in light of the foregoing analysis, if he has not presented us with an unbalanced picture of "nature" - one skewed toward time and away from space - and in that asymmetry softened the realization of the moral seriousness of our contemporary situation and the tragedy inherent within it. In the first chapter of The Lively Experiment, Mead argued that the turning point in American religious history came with the closing of the frontier, to which he then added this gloss, " ... while space on this earth is obviously limited, time is less so and may indeed be infinite."32 Mead's evolutionary theology of the "Republic" may be viewed as an extended development of that insight. Unfortunately, this development has entailed a gradual attenuation of the worldly, ethical dimension of human existence. If one traces the changes in the content of the transcendent community of identity as Mead has conceived it over the past three decades, one finds a movement from "the people" as the "moral structure . . on which all inequalities and injustices break," to "the people" as "unbroken biological continuity . . . not good or evil," to "life itself." The religious importance of concrete, practical human interaction with space ultimately disappears. But space is not so easily discarded from our experience. It is both the stage of our earthly drama and the sacrament that we daily share. Apart from the diverse qualities of "nature" in their spatial spread, "life itself" is unimaginable. The fact that these qualities are diminishing and that choices must be made about them within the finite limits of this earth cannot be avoided by a faith in time or the universe as a whole no matter how poetically portrayed. What Mead's grasp of the contemporary human condition calls for, yet what his theology so far fails to provide, is an ecological perspective on human history and destiny in which the variety which is our common humanity, like the variety of all natural creation, is potentially both an end in itself and a synergistic means to the flourishing of a common world. I submit that it is to some such concept of a "Republic of the World" that Mead's theology of the democratic faith must move if it is to give adequate formulation to the tragic vision of human existence. 32Mead, The Lively Experiment, (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1963), p. 13.</page></plain_text>
