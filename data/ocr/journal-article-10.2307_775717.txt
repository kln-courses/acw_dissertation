<plain_text><page sequence="1">but both he and Wittkower agree that there was not a Jesuit style which affected significant forms of architecture. Howard Hibbard of Columbia gives a good description of the paintings which were originally commissioned to decorate the Gesui, and he makes the point that the program was conceptual, like a sermon, with no aesthetic direction of unity. He also points out that even artists of differ- ent styles were chosen to do the work and that their sources varied from medieval to contemporary. Very appropriately Francis Haskell of Oxford asks why there was no Jesuit style. He concludes that it was the Jesuits' overriding desire for austerity. However, he does reveal that there was one General of the Order, Oliva, who had a feeling for the arts, and that it was during the rule of Oliva that Bernini, Baciccio, and Pozzo were engaged to decorate Jesuit churches in Rome. The longest essay, and perhaps the most complex, is Rend Taylor's entitled "Hermetism and Mystical Architecture." Dr. Taylor deals primarily with the Span- ish Jesuit Juan Bautista Villalpando's re- construction of the Temple of Solomon based on the prophecy of Ezechiel and with Father Kircher's reconstructions of Noah's Ark and the Tower of Babel. The particular interest at this time in the first two buildings was their reflection of God's will, and both of these theologians in their writings linked Christian mysticism with Hermetic thinking (namely, astrol- ogy, numerology, anthropomorphism, the microcosm-macrocosm, etc.) The last two essays deal with the Jesuits and two other cultural expressions: the- ater and music. Per Bjurstrom, Curator of Prints and Drawings at the Nationalmu- seum, Stockholm, introduces his subject, theater, by informing us that "Jesuit drama began as a bid to compete with the other pleasures which Rome offered the students of the colleges who considered themselves entitled to some kind of enter- tainment during the carnival. From these tactical beginnings Jesuit drama gradually developed into a means of instruction and indoctrination," and he speaks of their "spectacular Biblical pageants." BjurstrSm mainly discusses stage design, and he finds the same striving after illu- sory and dramatic effects which is charac- teristic of painting and sculpture in Ba- roque Rome and the same attempt to bring the Bible close to the believer. The essay by Thomas Culley of the Col- lege of the Holy Cross is entitled, "The German College: a Center for Baroque Music." He says that at least three Jesuit colleges were outstanding for their musi- cal instruction before the end of the six- teenth century but none had more far- reaching influence than Collegium Ger- manicum in Rome. The most gifted musi- cians were attracted to it, and its peripa- tetic students carried their skills to Ger- many, Austria, France, England, and Scandinavia. Culley points out that the movement was not completely one-way, for the college invited Flemish organ-mak- ers to Rome to build two very unusual and versatile organs-as he writes, "a gi- gantic step toward the Baroque organ that would later be fully realized." All of the essays are instructive and pro- vide a springboard for further study of this connection between Jesuit thinking and the arts, particularly now in the areas of painting and sculpture which were only lightly touched in this symposium. Could not the question, "Is there a tangible re- lationship between Jesuit writing and pictorial expression?" be profitably exam- ined? Some of us have pondered this in regard to St. Ignatius' Spiritual Exercises and Vanitas painting (e.g., Elizabeth Trapier in her Valdes Leal monograph), and recently Craig Felton has postulated the influence of the Spiritual Exercises on Ribera's early paintings (in the Bulletin of the Wadsworth Atheneum, Winter 1970). There are many other Jesuit au- thors to be considered such as the Spaniard Baltasar Gracian who wrote the fascinating allegory "El Criticon" among other books. (Also, it might be interesting to assess the subject from the other camp and investi- gate "The Pernicious (?)/Beneficial (?) Ef- fects of the Arts on Jesuit Thinking of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Cen- turies"!) The subject of the Jesuits and music might be further probed and possibly ex- panded to consider parallels between ex- pression in religious music and in Ba- roque art. The biography of St. Francis Borgia, third General of the Order, asserts that he liked music, and we see in Rome at this time a resurgence of musical inter- est with Palestrina's rise to prominence- from his Mass dedicated to the Pope through his subsequent appointments as choirmaster of the Julian chapel in St. Pe- ter's and later as director in St. Philip Neri's Oratory. Another dimension is the art and architecture of the Company of Je- sus in Latin America. At any rate, this com- pendium of essays lays the groundwork for further studies of the Jesuits vis-a-vis the arts which we hope will be equally il- luminating. ELEANOR M.

Any new book demands to be consid- ered from the standpoint of intended level of writing, and to what segment of the reading public it addresses itself. In this instance, and we are dealing for the time being with the first book under re- view, these particular aims are spelled out by the General Editor, who states in his Preface: "The Library of Art History . . . is designed for . . . educated laymen, up- per-class undergraduates and scholars in other fields ... " Consequently, we know that the vol- ume was not designed as a scholarly trea- tise but as a general introduction to a seg- ment of the field of Western Art History. As such, it remains to be seen whether the authors have fulfilled the task they set out to achieve, and whether the subdivision of material constitutes a reasonably coherent unit. We shall address ourselves to the latter question first, bearing in mind that the main responsibility for delimiting the var- ious constituent parts of the Library of Art History devolves upon the General Editor rather than the individual authors. It is perfectly correct to state, as does H. W. Janson, that one-volume Histories of Art are cumbersome and have the dis- advantage of being too restrictive as to text and illustration; and that they demand, accessorily, a wide range of competence from the author. We have pointed out to several publishers as long ago as the early 1950's, that a more detailed subdivision was desirable; and in fact, the Ullstein Kunstgeschichte can be considered as the most adequate and scholarly solution of the problem, together with the new Pro- pylden Kunstgeschichte, and the Pelican History of Art in the English language. Subdivisions of the entire context into a few volumes only remain in not con- spicuously lesser fashion inhibited with the main defects: cursory treatment, at- tempted coverage of wide and disparate areas of subject matter; and demand upon the authors to disperse their efforts. This book constitutes a good example of the latter treatment. While the same publishers brought out an exemplary vol- ume on the History of Italian Renais- sance Art, which, partly, because it en- compasses a unitary art historical period, has become a great achievement (the other part is due to the high competence of the author, Professor Frederick Hartt) -the Held-Posner volume deals with many divergent stylistic phases, facets and 474</page><page sequence="2">aspects. There is no intrinsic unity of de- sign and purpose in Western Art from roughly 1570 (inception of "I1 Gesui") to the 1780's (exemplified by the "Oath of the Horatii"); and although Held at- tempts, in his Introduction, to make a case for stylistic oneness embracing the periods, the argument falls far short of es- tablished and clearly tangible facts. We have thus to do with a willful break-up of the reasonable art historical stream into illogically assembled visual rags and tatters. To the main trends of 17th Century Art, the 18th Century is appended like a delicate Arabian mare coupled with a fiery charger. The answer to the question: for whom was this book designed?-becomes there- fore rather simplified. The stranger to Art History may find it of value, if he does not wish to read more advanced and de- tailed studies. But to the upper-class un- dergraduate student it is useless. The dearth of material, the superficial treat- ment, make the book unsuitable as a text -the more so as hardly any respectable Art Department in this country schedules any more a one semester joint course in the 17th and 18th centuries. For a divi- sion into coverage of two successive semes- ters, the volume does not offer adequate and sufficient reading matter. Considering moreover its cost, no teacher will want to assign it to his students as a mere supple- ment of information. This reduces the book to its main func- tion, that of the coffee-table, where, with its impressive format and number of ex- cellent illustrations, it will find its proper place. Have the authors adequately fulfilled their task? As already pointed out, Held and Pos- ner had to cope with an array of often contradictory materials that flash across di- vergent fields. Consequently, they were in need of qualifications that far exceed their rather narrow specialization. Nei- ther of the writers is a polygraph. What would have been child's play for any number of art historians, whose names the reader can easily call to mind, has turned in this instance into an amalga- mate of uneven essays-acceptable in the authors' respective areas; and rather indi- gestible in what remains outside their pale. Even the language differs: being fluid and persuasive in the former, stilted and pedantic in the latter. We shall discuss the contributions of the authors in the sequence in which they occur, keeping in mind that Held was re- served the lion's share. In his Introduction to Baroque Art, Held is first concerned with the etymol- ogy of the term, then of the concept. Whether it stems from a syllogism that was ridiculed by 16th century anti-scholas- tic writers, or from the Portuguese 'bar- occo' identifying irregular pearls (a more probable derivation)-the meaning of 'baroque' was, as Ren6 Huyghe clearly states after Victor-L. Tapie as follows: ap- pearance during the 18th century; men- tion in the dictionary of the French Acad- emy as synonymous of irregularity; de- fined in 1797 by Milizia in his Dictionary of Fine Arts as "the superlative of bizarre, the excess of ridicule." Its full scope was given to both term and concept by H. Woelfflin in 1888 in his Renaissance und Barock; and since then, the concept became more and more refined, according to the bent of the particular interpreter. Nowadays we differentiate between "ba- roque" as an historical as opposed to an art historical definition. Taken in the first sense, it covers indistinctly the 17th cen- tury. In its second connotation, "baroque" becomes a style critical entity, which, eventually, can appear in any civi- lization; and is characterized by the curved line, sinuosity of design, conquest of space and dramatic expression-to cite some of its qualities only. As far as the style becomes apparent during the 17th century, it is one of several streams only, other contemporary artistic modes of ex- pression being called Classicism and Real- ism. In this context it becomes quite clear, that although at some time and by some writers, 18th century Art has been in- cluded in the general "baroque" concept, nobody would nowadays countenance the attempt. The 'Rococo' has become a sepa- rate configuration, which can no more be integrated into the Baroque, than the lat- ter with the Renaissance. Threads lead from one to the other, but without en- compassing both styles into unity. Held has not put these facts as clearly as one could wish, and as we are attempt- ing to do here succinctly. He completely forgets that as early as 1913, Werner Som- bart in his Luxus und Kapitalismus sets already the Rococo style apart and identi- fies it with a specific and separate kind of luxury product. Thus, Sombart who was by no means an art historian but rather a sociologist, made use of the distinct termi- nology in a general humanistic context. Held's contention therefore, that there are 'general connections' from roughly 1580 to the third quarter of the 18th cen- tury, although qualified by the addition of 'often tenuous,' must be rejected. It is an argument ad usum delphini. It is also regrettable that the author un- der review has studiously avoided to give due credit to French scholarship in the field-the more so as studies have been blossoming during the last two decades, mainly owing to the translation of Woelf- flin's Principles into that language in the 1950's. As early as 1935, Eugenio d'Ors published his Du Baroque in Paris-a vol- ume that was going to be seminal for the French approach to the period (the origi- nal text by that author-Del barocco-ap- peared in 1954 only, in Milan). Victor-L. Tapie's basic book Baroque et Classicisme (Paris, 1957) is given lip service in the general bibliography under its American title The Age of Grandeur, but never re- ferred to in Held's writings or in the Notes. As to Rene Huyghe, Pierre Char- pentrat, Germain Bazin, and many others, they might just as well have never existed! Turning now to Chapter 1, Italy in the Seventeenth Century, Held has secured for himself the Introduction and the parts dealing with the Architecture and the Sculpture of the period. The Introduc- tion is short and to the point. The same cannot be said of the division dealing with the Architecture. Here, the short- comings of the book become immediately apparent. The restrictions of space make for "too little" in every subdivision, lead- ing to desultory treatment of what, quite often, constitutes a good beginning. Thus Held's handling of "I1 Gesu"-though stilted and dry in style, this being extra- neous to his favorite studies-is workman- like in the explanation of the faCade. The idea of a comparison with Guidetti's "S. Caterina dei Funari," though certainly not new, is to the point and makes for a good demonstration of the verticality of "I1 Gesu." However, one would have wished for illustration of the interior of the Church, and more detailed explana- tion of its particularities. The preoccupa- tion of the Jesuits with the sermon was responsible for structural changes that de- mand to be set out in more detail. Maderno is given, quite deservedly, great importance in this essay. "S. Su- sanna," as well as his principal claim to glory-the facade of "St. Peter's," are cor- rectly dealt with in somewhat broader scope. One wonders perhaps, however, why space has been reserved for a decid- edly minor luminary, Francesco Maria Ricchino, when Baldassare Longhena's "S. Maria della Salute" receives compara- tively sketchy treatment; and when Ber- nini as an architect was given the short end of a stick. One would like to ask why, if Ricchino was mentioned, and his facade of "S. Giuseppe" in Milan awarded the honor of an illustration, Held did not include also Giovanni Ma- genta of Bologna or Bartolomeo Bianco of Genoa. Given the scarcity of space available, it seems that the main figures should rather have profited from more de- velopment in depth. This is particularly 476</page><page sequence="3">true of Bernini, whose "S. Tommaso di Villanova" at Castelgandolfo; and most important, "S. Maria dell'Assunzione" at Ariccia, were worth more than blunt omission, or mere mention in passing-as in the case of the latter Church (p. 37). An identical remark applies to Fran- cesco Borromini. "S. Carlo," "S. Ivo" and a scant explanation of "Sant'Agnese," re- main all that we learn about this most im- portant figure of Roman High Baroque Architecture. The author's approach ex- cels in superficiality, barely setting out the main characteristics and completely failing to expound the basic contributions of this versatile and highly gifted archi- tect to the essence of Baroque style. In short, the essay, squarely based on Wittkower, has none of the latter's liveli- ness and scholarly impact. A dry enumera- tion interspersed with rather pedestrian analysis has to suffice. The following part of the chapter, de- voted to Sculpture, also by Held, seems to be more to the author's taste. Primarily dealing with the art of Bernini, we have here a short but discriminating introduc- tion to Gianlorenzo's artistic evolution. Taking into account works from the on- coming maturity, such as the Borghese groups; to the "St. Theresa," tomb sculp- ture, portraiture and including the "Bal- dacchino" and fountains; Held has very well conceived the nature of Bernini's ge- nius, his technical virtuosity joined to an emotional, dramatic and theatrical ap- peal. He waxes almost eloquent with re- spect to qualities of hair and drapery, and succeeds in conveying to the reader essen- tial aspects of Bernini's conception and expression as a sculptor. One deplores however the sparsity of treatment de- volved to the Classicists. Both, Algardi and Duquesnoy deserve better than one illustration each! The sub-division dealing with Painting comes from the pen of Donald Posner, whose latest contribution to that visual as- pect of the period were two volumes on Annibale Carracci. Curiously enough, his treatment of the Carracci family is the weakest part of the essay. Almost entirely descriptive, he has difficulty in bringing out the stylistic differences between the two brothers and the cousin, and lacks in strength of characterization. About half a page is all that could be devoted to the "Farnese ceiling" and such superficial treatment can hardly do justice to what is one of the great monuments of fresco painting of the time. Caravaggio, on the other hand, is presented with great empa- thy and understanding. It must be rated the best part of a succinct presentation, which allows hardly a page for the genius of Poussin, and centers mainly on Rome, with the most fleeting references to the provincial schools only. Strozzi is men- tioned solely in passing with one illustra- tion! The author shows competence and a fluid style in these pages. For more de- tailed treatment, one must look to E. Wa- terhouse, Italian Baroque Painting. One wonders why Ribera was included here, and not in the apposite Chapter (3.- Spain in the Seventeenth Century)-al- though, of course, a case can be made on account of variegated cross influences be- tween Ribera's Naples studio and other parts of Italy. However, Ribera's connec- tions with Spain remained vivid, and his inclusion amidst the artists of his native land would have added consistency to the mere bones of information offered in Chapter 3. Posner is also the author of the entire Chapter 2, France in the Seventeenth Century. Architecture is treated in a com- pact but informative manner. Salomon de Brosse, Jacques Lemercier and Francois Mansart are being given coverage, as well as Louis Le Vau, whose "Vaux-le- Vicomte" is described competently, though succinctly. One would however have liked to see more space allotted to Versailles. On the whole, this part of the chapter is well written and competently expounded; it offers the required infor- mation. In the sub-division dealing with the Painting of the period, Posner has chosen the method of short juxtapositions of characterizations dealing with the princi- pal artists. In his attempt to be as all-em- bracing as possible, major personalities have of course been shortchanged. Thus, Georges de La Tour is restricted to two columns, unfortunately featuring an ap- proach that has largely become obsolete in the light of the recent Exhibition of the artist's oeuvre at the Orangerie of Paris. It now appears that an Italian trip by the painter c. 1613 has more and more entered the realm of probabilities, whereas the hypothesis of travel to Hol- land c. 1620 was abandoned. We also do not see La Tour predominantly as a painter of religious and night scenes any more (contra Posner, p. 146). Grouped around Pierre Landry's discovery of 1926 of the "Tricheur A l'as de carreau," a number of daylight paintings have now been identified, that by far expand La Tour's importance, concepts and paint- erly involvement. It is regrettable that the writing of this chapter could not have been scheduled so as to enable the author to take new findings into account. Another remark that springs to the eye is the duplication of the treatment of Ni- colas Poussin. Admittedly, the artist was influential both in Italy and in France, but considering the evident lack of space prevailing in the book under reviews for figures of major importance (cf. the scant attention awarded the Lenain brothers, p. 147 et ss), one can hardly approve the ex- tent reserved for him in both Chapters 1 and 2. It is not a matter of questioning Poussin's impact, but of the overall orga- nization of the two accounts. A fusion in one of the chapters would have been bet- ter economy and more pertinent. The complementary essay on Sculpture, consisting of eight pages including the il- lustration, can consequently not be called an attempt in depth. Rather, some of the main figures are being cursorily treated: Puget, Girardon and Coysevox-to the detriment of minor but still worthwhile artists. Posner himself cites some among them in is first paragraph, but neither text nor illustration attempt-not to say completeness-but a higher level of infor- mation. Certainly, one at least of Sarazin's works from the Louvre should have been included-the artist being one of the fore- most French sculptors who followed Mi- chelangelo. Posner is again responsible for Chapter 3-Spain. in the Seventeenth Century. The part dealing with Painting offers a good characterization of Velasquez, around which the entire essay is grouped. Most of the author's information is derived from Lopez Rey, but this does not constitute disparaging criticism. Lopez Rey being an excellent guide to follow in this context. Posner is leading up to Velasquez with a short account of Zurbaran, that differs in some aspects from the writings of Martin Soria. However, he brings out Zurbaran's personality in concise phrases and conveys very well the essence of his art. The same can be said of the passages devoted to Murillo: short and to the point. As we have stated before, this chapter is cut down to the bone. Apart from some highlights, the reader is not offered any insight into the development of Spanish 17th century Art. If one were to believe Posner, who even retrenches Ribera from this account, Spain would be a poor place indeed during this period, insofar as the visual arts are concerned. After the skele- ton just served, he deals with Sculpture in one page of text and three illustrations; whereas Architecture rates again one page of text, three illustrations and one ground plan. Portugal has been ignored alto- gether. One can hardly refrain from thinking, that Posner's sympathies do not lie with the Iberian Peninsula, its arts, culture and civilization. It would have been preferable to cut out the chapter al- together, rather than induce the unsus- pecting reader to believe that such pau- city is fact. Held wrote Chapters 4 (Flemish Paint- ing in the Seventeenth Century) and 5 (Dutch Painting in the Seventeenth Cen- 478</page><page sequence="4">tury). They constitute by far his best ef- fort in the medley. Chapter 4 is rather short, comprising 26 pages only, as com- pared to the 58 pages devoted to Dutch Painting. One hopes that this does not imply a qualitative judgment, but solely the inference that the author was primar- ily inspired by his main theme of study: Rubens; and inclined to neglect the re- maining luminaries on the Flemish firma- ment. Held is perfectly at ease in the ac- count of Rubens. He has overcome the staccato phrasing of previous essays, and leads the reader competently through the life, personality and main phases of Peter Paul's artistic evolution. The leading fig- ure, one might even say the personifica- tion of the Flemish Baroque, Rubens' greatness and stylistic characteristics are ably demonstrated. In comparison to the main figure, Van Dyck and Jordaens re- ceive short shrift. Sir Anthony's specialty- portrait painting-is dealt with rather condescendingly, and if he receives grudg- ing credit for narrative and religious painting, his own claim to greatness re- mains secondary, according to Held. We fully agree that Rubens was the ge- nius, but Van Dyck's great talent deserves better than fleeting acknowledgment. Jor- daens is represented according to old cliches, as "unsophisticated" and "given to a boisterous sense of humor." One might easily quarrel with that kind of descrip- tion, which constitutes too facile a charac- terization and fails to take into account the artist's weight as moralizer; and as de- vout and moving author of religious scenes, especially during the period pre- ceding his conversion to the Reformed Faith. Even Brouwer does not rate Held's sympathies. For him, Brouwer concen- trates on rather disreputable subject mat- ter, when he is not painting "gloomy landscapes." (p. 217). Hardly a word in passing concerning his almost impression- istic freedom, technical innovation, and conceptual individuality. Of the hundreds of other important artists that worked in Flanders in the 17th century, solely a few names are mentioned in passing, and not a single work reproduced. Van Thulden, Schut, Caspar de Crayer, Jan Wildens, Jan Siberecht and so many others are vir- tually passed over. One has the feeling, that Held's enthusiasm for this great pe- riod is distinctly on the wane, and that, although he cannot help writing a more than competent appraisal of Rubens, the remainder of Flanders becomes relegated to a backseat. The unbalance of the chap- ter can with difficulty otherwise be ac- counted for. A pertinent example for our viewpoint is furnished by the first pages of the subsequent chapter on Dutch Painting, where Held reproduces on the same page a panel by the relatively unim- portant Bartholomeus Breenbergh, and a Scandinavian Landscape by Allaert van Everdingen-quite clearly another second string artist. Hence the question: why those and not Jan Wildens? As far as Chapter 5 is concerned, the change is all to the good. We finally have to do with a comprehensive treatment, that encompasses the minor masters as well as the highlights of the century: Frans Hals, Rembrandt and Vermeer. The account is lucid, well written and in- formative. Aside from the great trio, land- scape, interior and still-life genres are dealt with in sufficient depth, so as to fur- nish a most satisfactory over-all view of the Painting of Holland's Golden Age. On a minor scale, this chapter competes with Slive-Rosenberg's Dutch Art and Ar- chitecture for insight and terseness. Alas! the quality of rendition does not remain equal in the next chapter, also by Held (6.-Northern European Architec- ture in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries). After a brief incursion into Dutch and Danish architecture of the pe- riod, the main part is reserved for English building. There is no doubt that Inigo Jones, Wren, Vanbrugh and James Gibbs deserve ample mention. However, Bel- gium also belongs to that part of Europe, and one remains amazed at the complete omission of monuments such as Scherpen- heuvel, the lost Jesuit Church in Brussels, St. Loup at Namur and many others. They constitute a significant contribution to Northern European Architecture, and even a cursory essay must needs take them into consideration. Holland is scantily represented with the Mauritshuis in The Hague and the Town Hall of Amsterdam. Can one really eliminate from such a sur- vey the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam, and the Huis ten Bos near The Hague, with- out severely infringing upon the architec- tonic image of this region? Our quarrel is that Held's expose presents itself hope- lessly lopsided-as if outside of England no important architectonic work had taken place in Northern Europe. Surely, this erroneous approach grievously misin- forms the reader. Posner has penned the Chapters 7 and 8 (France in the Eighteenth Century, and Italy in the Eighteenth Century). It is hardly worth while to give them a de- tailed review. The treatment becomes of the greatest superficiality, skimming over the highlights (Boucher is rated deserving all of one and half columns and two illus- trations) and barely adducing more mate- rial than the equivalent space alloted to the period in one of the one-volume His- tories of Art, which this series is supposed to advantageously supplant and replace. At least, Painting in Chapter 7 includes Jacques-Louis David, whereas the corre- sponding treatment of Architecture stops short with the Petit Trianon and disdains completely an 18th century French land- mark: the Pantheon by Soufflot! One wonders at the logic which rules such sins of omission. Italy shares the identical cur- sory approach. Painting is abbreviated; Sculpture lacks such main figures as Pierre LeGros and Camille Rusconi. And Architecture is "covered" in four and one half pages including illustrations! Need- less to say, not one word or illustration can be found concerning the so-called mi- nor arts, which constitute so important a contribution to the artistic aspect of the century. The ten pages devoted by Held to Chapter 9 (English Painting in the Eigh- teenth Century) comprise by no means text only. They are interspersed by ample illustrations, so that nothing but the bar- est of outlines emerges. No wonder that the reader retains next to nothing from what would not even rate sufficient mate- rial for a "Life Magazine" story. Chapter 10, again authored by Held, is, for this book, a rather comprehensive ac- count of Germany and Austria in the Sev- enteenth and Eighteenth Centuries. It re- mains still a rather ambitious undertaking to make sense out of the wealth of Art produced in this region at the period, and that in 31 pages including some full-page illustrations and numerous cuts. But the author tries very hard to bring out the es- sentials. Lack of space forces him to elimi- nate so outstanding a monument as the Castle of Schonbrunn from consideration. This is one example only of the lacunae in what aims to be a rather ample survey, and which is in fine nothing but the mer- est touching upon the extant material. The footnotes are adequate, although rather capricious. The same is true of the bibliography, which mirrors the preju- dices of the authors. As far as presenta- tion is concerned, the black and white il- lustrations as well as the color plates are excellent. The text is clearly printed, on good quality paper. One must state, that the publisher did a beautiful technical job. Summing up, we can only repeat that the book is very uneven as to quality; and that for that reason, as well as the brevity and superficiality in the treatment of the material; it cannot be of any use as a Col- lege text. It is a question of far too little meat in an otherwise richly adorned pie. However, we are sure that a number of readers seeking secondary information will find it pleasant and informative. Separate College texts, dealing each with the 17th and the 18th century in 480</page><page sequence="5">Western Art, remain to this day an urgent necessity. The present volume does not fulfill the purpose. Sewter-Baroque and Rococo Much of what has been said concerning the preceding book can be repeated here. Before all, as far as use as a College text is concerned, the volume contains too little over too broad a period. In both in- stances, market-research seems to be at fault. Respectable American Colleges do not offer any more combined one semes- ter courses in 17th and 18th century Art. Hence, the book becomes too succinct for the purposes of separate courses and re- dundant in its general appeal. Brevity can be a virtue, but in this case so much nec- essary material has by force been omitted that it seriously impairs the usefulness for even a general review text. The gentleman from the University of Manchester has done a competent job. Unevenness, about which we complained in the previous instance, has been elimi- nated due to single authorship. However, this means that highlights are also lack- ing. The book is of a uniform quality, that does not exceed average standards. The presentation is adequate. The text is legibly printed, the black and white il- lustrations are sometimes good, sometimes immersed in darkness; and the color illus- trations are consistently of poor quality. Before concluding this review, we feel that a timely remark has to be inserted. This book, like many others of the same series, is quite obviously aimed at the American College market. In this case, we would remind the gentlemen of New York and elsewhere, who publish commer- cial books, that we expect American au- thors to be chosen for the job. The pres- ent volume is, as we have said, a work- manlike presentation. But it could have been done as well by any number of our graduate students. It does not embody original research, but rather a synthesis of generalities, for which there is no need to be an outstanding scholar. We have liter- ally dozens of Junior Faculty members on our Colleges and Universities, who could perform equally well. We do not train and educate our American art historians, so that our students be forced to adopt texts written by British and other schol- ars, who are unaccustomed to our habits of teaching and methodology. The more so, as our average level in the field of Art History is so much higher than that of England. This is no exercise in chauvin- ism. We welcome learned contributions from abroad; indeed they are our life- blood. But we certainly feel very strongly, that our young art historians should be called upon exclusively for commercial projects by the self-same publishers who aim to make a fortune in our College market. And we are convinced that it is up to us, the older generation, to exercise the requisite pressure in view of the real- ization of this fact as a constant publish- ing policy in this country.
