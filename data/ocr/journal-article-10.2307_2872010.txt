<plain_text><page sequence="1">NATURE MORALIZED: THE DIVINE ANALOGY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY By EARL R. WASSERMAN I When Bacon wrote that poetry subjects the shows of things to the desires of the mind, whereas reason doth buckle and bow the mind unto the nature of things, he was assenting to that divorce of head and heart, of object and value, that accompanied the approaching end of the Renaissance; the same divorce that the Romantics would later struggle to repair by once again wedding outward thing and inward meaning. The shows of things belong to the domain of science, where the materials of experience exist in themselves, stripped of values; where a primrose by a river's brim is only a yellow primrose. But art, even in its most rudimentary form, is the translation of these materials into appraisals, emotions, and meanings. And the serious artist cannot willingly accept Bacon's hy- pothesis that such translations sacrifice the shows of things, for the dignity of his art is predicated upon his ability to per- ceive truths that accord with his ontology. If the objects of perception are not already invested with traditional values- as they were for Dante and Shakespeare and Milton-the poet must bring about his own synthesis of fact and interpretation- as the Romantic poet was compelled to do. In the pre-Baconian world accredited systems interpretive of things were ready at hand for the poet's use, and so he had available the materials of poetry even before he shaped them into poems. These sys- tems, moreover, were ontologically true; in understanding his inner self in terms of the physical universe, Sir Thomas Browne, for example, was accepting as truth that interpretive pattern whose premise is that " every man is a Microcosm, and carries the whole World about him." When, in the post-Baconian world these interpretive premises had lost almost all validity, the first task of the Romantic was to attain a world-view that again related subject to object; having lost faith in the older syntheses, he had to take the world of things, which science 39</page><page sequence="2">40 NATURE MORALIZED had shorn of all but objective existence, and had to invest it with values through his own understanding of its structure and meaning. The Romantic, that is, first had to make his materials poetic before he could shape them into poems; and the primacy of this task helps explain why his poetry is so largely a quest for a metaphysics. I make these obvious generalizations in order to bring into meaningful focus the period between the Renaissance and the nineteenth century. Yet to come were the mythologists, like Keats and Shelley, who transformed classical myths in order to unfold objectively their systems of values. And yet to come were Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley, who, through symbol and pantheistic image, coalesced material things and their spiritual meanings. Behind lay the Renaissance world- pictures, already poetic in themselves and rather generally accepted as ways of reading nature. Most prevalent of these were Christian and pagan myth and the system of analogical correspondences. The last, the system of correspondences, was accepted as " scientific," not fictitious, for it was assumed that God, expressing Himself in all creation, made the physical, moral, and spiritual levels analogous to each other and to Him- self. Therefore, object and subject, thing and value, matter and spirit, were related proportionately; for the divine architect made the universe like man, and man like angel, and all in the image of Himself. All not-objects could be truthfully expressed as like objects. But the work of science was to sever value from the nature of things. To a scientific age a fiction felt as " truth is an im- possible paradox. Hence the classical myths came to be felt as wholly false-neither true in themselves nor true as means of interpretation. One could set this mythology in mock-heroic juxtaposition with his own world, but he could no longer inform and animate it with his own experiences. It is unnecessary to examine the manner in which science, skepticism, and ration- alistic deism shattered the Christian myth. Scripture became fiction, or allegory, or metaphor-anything but literal truth; and its ultimate doctrines, the deists argued, could be better found by other means. The problem to be examined, then, is the position of the eighteenth century in this transition from a world of pre-existent poetic materials to one in which they must</page><page sequence="3">EARL R. WASSERMAN 41 be fashioned by the poet. What is the eighteenth-century artist's glossary for translating outward things into inward meanings? On the answer will largely depend the key figures and the ordering of his art, for the poem is the poet's micro- cosm: his objective correlatives and the shape of his creations are determined by the structure and substance of his own world-picture. Only the system of analogical correspondences, so rich and fluid in the Renaissance, did not become merely fanciful, but acquired from other eighteenth-century movements a more rea- soned and qualifying basis. However, by becoming more reason- able through efforts to reconcile itself with the new science and psychology, the divine analogy also became less splendid and flexible-less poetic. The Renaissance artist could find similitude in microcosm and macrocosm, divine and political order, flame and divine grace, circle and eternity. In so inclu- sive a framework he could range widely in his conjunction of value and image, untroubled by scientific truth; and he could enjoy the security of an all-embracing pattern of relationships that gave order to his experiences. When these analogies were brought out of the mist of faith and were examined for a rationale, the poet became timid lest his analogies be reckless, more limited to only small fragments of the total analogical pattern, and less confident of its ontological validity. Yet, the divine analogy remained for the eighteenth century the rela- tional norm of image and value, and when finally it collapsed through over-much probing, it was obvious to the Romantic that his first task was to put the two worlds together again.' 1 The tendency to discover similitudes is no doubt one of the radical principles of the human spirit, and therefore we need not seek to explain its presence in eighteenth-century thought as we might be expected to explain the presence of a doctrine of evolution in a particular age. The earlier analogy of macrocosm and microcosm lingers on noticeably in such works as Hobbes' Leviathan and J. T. Desagulier's poem The Newtonian System of the World, the Best Model of Gov- ernment (Westminster, 1728); and Leibnitz' monadism is founded on the same basic analogy (see George P. Conger, Theories of Macrocosms and Microcosms, New York, 1922). The new science, bent upon absorbing all aspects of thought and feeling and upon examining them with the same instruments it was using upon the physical world, at least implied a similarity of inner and outer reality, but only by reducing all to a materialism. Spinoza's Ethic Demonstrated in Geometrical Order, for example, is but one of a long succession of treatises expounding human thought and action in terms of mathematics. Moreover, the imagery of the Bible and the more literal interpretations of the doctrine that man is made in the image</page><page sequence="4">42 NATURE MORALIZED II One obvious source of the divine analogy for the eighteenth century was the doctrine of the Great Chain of Being and its attendant Platonism. In its simplest form it was held by one theorist that the "regular Gradation of created Beings from Man down to the lowest Vegetable " explains the basis of metaphor. Because all the links of the Chain are similar, joy and grief can be read in trees and plants; and precepts of morality can be insinuated by reference to " those Faculties in the Souls of Brutes, which bear an Analogy to the Will and Passions, and enable them to act with a resemblance of the Virtues and Vices of Mankind." 2 At the other extreme, one of the most extravagant expressions of this sort of Platonic analogy appears in the writings of the fashionable physician, Dr. George Cheyne, a friend of such literary figures as Pope, Richardson, Chesterfield, Fielding, Gay, and Young. Cheyne's popular Philosophical Principles of Religion 3 was founded entirely on this one principle of analogy, and he persisted in introducing it into his other works, even into his treatise on diet, but never once admitted that he had borrowed the doc- trine whole from the fifteenth-century Nicholas of Cusa. Since, Cheyne reasoned, all created things are explications of God, the various planes of creation must be analogous to each other and of God obviously impel Christian thought in the direction of analogical reasoning. Even a mere recognition of the linguistic relation of such words as spirit and breath leads easily to the assumption of a relationship in fact; and many found support for this belief in St. Paul's assurance that the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made. Finally, the intricate Thomistic system of analogical reasoning as a means of reconciling infinites with the finite nature of man's mind and experience had passed directly from such Scholastics as Suarez and Cajetan to the eighteenth- century English divines. That there should be some analogical ordering of the physical and spiritual systems in the eighteenth century is, then, hardly unexpected. But what is under investigation here is the special forces at work that not only kept alive, to a degree not usually recognized, the long Mediaeval and Renaissance tradition that the master key to the total scheme of creation is similitude, but also molded that tradition and its attendant art into their peculiar eighteenth-century form. In The Breaking of the Circle Professor Marjorie Nicolson has dealt with the collapse of the divine analogy in the seventeenth century; my purpose here is to trace the residue of the idea throughout the eighteenth century and to evaluate the effect of the enervated form of the idea upon literary practice. 2 Oppian, Halieuticks, trans.

In this fashion he was able to main- tain an orthodox dualism, creature and Creator being sepa- rated by an infinite number of degrees; and yet he could bridge the gap for man by assuming a similitude, so that the physical, seen sub specie infinitatis, is spiritualized into aspects of divinity. Since " there is a perpetual Analogy ... running on in a Chain, through the whole System of Creatures, up to their Creator . . . the visible are Images of the Invisible, the Sensible of the Insensible, the Ectypal of the Archetypal, the Creatures of the Creator, at an absolutely infinite distance." 4 To deny the infinite distance would have been to risk heretical pan- theism and to minimize faith; to deny the analogy would have been to deny the value of empiricism in arriving at divine truth. Hence, " Analogy and its Appendages, Type, Allusion, Simili- tude, Parable, Hieroglyphic and Allegory (all more remote or nearer Approaches to Analogy) is the only natural Language the Deity can speak to us at present, under our Degeneracy and Lapse "; 5and human reason, although not a spiritual faculty, can frame and form Images of these superior Objects, from what it finds and certainly knows of the material World, to which it is in some measure adequate. Images . . . not Metaphorical only, but Real and Physical, as a Statue represents a Man, a Picture in Miniature, one from the Life, as a Seed . . . does a grown plant, or an Embryo, to the adult Animal .. . . there are various Images in Nature, and in the intellectual Species of Things . . . of all the most unconceivable, the most abstruse, and sublime Mysteries of Re- ligion and it's Philosophy.6 Having rejected the right reason of the deists and having found a link between Cusa's Platonism and Locke's sensationism, Cheyne assigned man the task of seeing things spiritual by the indirect, but only available means of sensory experience. That the Heavens declare the glory of God he took to mean, not simply that, as His works, their qualities reveal the attributes of their Maker, but that " all the Worlds, the Material, Moral and Spiritual, can possibly be nothing else, but the supreme, immense and infinitely perfect Being, display'd, pourtray'd, and made sensible and perceptible."7 'Philosophical Principles of Religion (London, 1715), preface. 'An Essay on Regimen (London, 1740), 228. o Philosophical Principles, 127-28. 7Essay on Regimen, 021.</page><page sequence="6">44 NATURE MORALIZED Cheyne, however, was not only a Cusan Platonist and a spiritual son of Paracelsus, but also a fellow of the Royal So- ciety, and in the Platonic ladder he found the reconciliation of his many roles. For if all the levels of creation are analogically related to divinity, but at different distances, the new science becomes fundamental as a means of ascent to God: If then we began with this inanimat World (in which only true natural Philosophy from final Causes can instruct us), thence pro- ceeded to the vegetable World, then advanc'd to the Brute Crea- tion (here natural History and Chymistry will be of great Service), and at last ascended to intelligent Beings, through the angelic Hierarchy, till by Analogy we arriv'd at the Supreme Cause; this Method would be the most natural and secure, in a natural Pro- gression by Analogy.8 In these terms analogy and its related figures are not merely rhetorical devices to arouse the passions, nor fictive expressions necessary because of the limitations of human faculties, but truths that result from God's infinitely unfolding Himself in creation. Cheyne the scientist would not have opposed the Royal Society's project "to separate the knowledge of Nature, from the colours of Rhetorick, the devices of Fancy, or the de- lightful deceit of Fables "; but since " Analogy is the Logic of the spiritual World," 9 simile is God's master plan and is the design of both physical and metaphysical truth. Indeed, the hypothesis of an analogical pattern explained to Cheyne the harmony and uniformity that the new science had been finding in the material world. The Platonic analogy had reconciled the new rhetoric, the new physics, the new psychology, and the old theology. But although Cheyne's system appears all-inclusive, the ex- amples he offers are few, traditional, and general. Various tripartite divisions of the physical world confirm the unity of the Trinity; the sunl is the analogue of God; and gravitation corresponds to man's impulse to reunite with God. Seldom does he pursue the analogies farther than this first level. Yet this caution is symptomatic of the leveling and weakening that analogy was to undergo. Since Cheyne had set out to make the analog-ical structure reasonable, he hesitated lest his ex- amples outfly his argument. Analogy, he found, allows only 1 I bid ., 69. 9 lIbid ., M4 .</page><page sequence="7">EARL R. WASSERMAN 45 "dark hints,"' and by it " We may very readily err in the Detail, and in the Eliciting and Application of a particular Case; but not so readily in the general Law." 10 Cautious generality, then, is the proper area for the artist working within the eighteenth- .century framework of analogical thought: analogies may be based on light, but not the western sky's peculiar tint of yellow green; on the ebb and flow of the waters, not the rare cham- bered nautilus. Despite this timid vagueness, however, Cheyne was obvi- ously an anachronism, for the Platonism he called upon to re- concile the new empiricism with the old theology was too mystical for those temperate days. He represents the extreme form of that tradition of correspondences inherited directly from the Renaissance and Middle Ages. A more moderate and prevalent form of Platonistic analogy was being elaborated meanwhile by the followers of Lord Shaftesbury. To demon- strate that the recognition of good and evil is instinctive, the Shaftesburians made analogous the moral sense and the sense of beauty. On the premise that God had expressed His own harmony everywhere, they drew an analogy between esthetic and ethical harmony, and claimed that man is fashioned to re- spond to the two in the same manner.' With this central analogy they were attempting to hold together what science was trying to sever: art and truth, theology and science, sub- ject and object. This analogy of the physical and moral was only loosely held by many Shaftesburians, but almost any adoption of the doctrines of Hutcheson led in that direction; and some seized upon the analogy as the key to unlock the meaning of nature. The Creator, according to John Gilbert Cooper, " ordained a perpetual agreement between the facul- ties of moral perfection, the powers of fancy, and the organs of bodily sensation." 12 Moral truths and mental modes have real correspondences in external nature, for " To each nat'ral scene / A moral pow'r belongs "; and the end of contemplating na- ture is attained when " each moral pow'r perceives / Its own resemblance, with fraternal joy, / In ev'ry form complete." 10Ibid., 226. "1 See, e. g., [George Stubbes], A Dialogue in the Manner of Plato (London, 1734), 44, 93-4. 12 The Power of Harmony, preface.</page><page sequence="8">46 NATURE MORALIZED Invoking the aid of those " moral genii who attend / The train of rural beauty," and marking their physico-moral nature by such descriptive terms as " Sweet innocence, and snowy-winged hope," Cooper set out to display The just similitude of moral charms, Of harmony and joy, with this fair frame Of outward things. This theme, only casual in Cooper, was developed into a total philosophy of ethics, theology, education, politics, and art by George Turnbull and by David Fordyce. That most eighteenth- century modes of thought gravitated in some degree towards the divine analogy is suggested by the wide range of the sources to which Turnbull admits indebtedness, and which he appar- ently felt to be harmonious with his doctrines: Plato, John Clarke, Berkeley, Butler, Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Pope, and Newton. For example, he sees in Pope's accounting for moral as for natural things and in his joining moral doctrine with corresponding poetic imagery the exemplification of the real analogy of the physical and the spiritual, the esthetic and the moral. But it is obviously Shaftesburian Platonism into which Turnbull funnels the other intellectual currents of his day. In these Shaftesburian systems of analogy, the major human faculty is not reason, but imagination, for it is the conjunctive, or analogizing, faculty; and art, the product of imagination, therefore is held to be an expression of profoundest truths. Since the Creator fashioned the two worlds analogously, He furnished man with imagination to perceive this similitude and made the exercise of imagination pleasurable in order to incite the discovery of similitudes." Fordyce would have liked to believe that the analogy of the physical and moral is a fixed part of God's scheme, but, being far gone in associationism, he ran the risk of implying that the imagination's correlation of the two areas, being subjective, is therefore arbitrary and rela- tive to the individual mind. He struggled, therefore, to bring into conformity the fixed outward plan and the inner associa- tive workings of the mind by distinguishing between the merely capricious imagination and that imagination which truthfully reports the analogies established by God. It is "in Conse- 18 George Turnbull, Principles of MOral Philosophy (London, 1740), 40.</page><page sequence="9">EARL R. WASSERMAN 47 quence of the Analogy in Nature," he writes, " that there is a wonderful Disposition in our Minds to analogize " and that we "1 are strangely delighted in applying moral Powers and Affec- tions to natural Objects; . . . in applying natural Qualities to intellectual or moral Principles and Actions." 14 In reality, there is " an Aptitude in the different Orders of Beauty, to represent either natural Good, or some sublimer moral Species," 15 but the discovery of these true analogies can be made by only ethically sound associations: " we Follow Nature, in forming our Associations, only when we connect the moral Species or Qualities with those Images or Forms of Beauty, to which she united them, and by which she designed them to be represented and recommended." 16 Only insofar as it is a rigorously con- trolled ethical faculty, then, will the otherwise willful and pleasure-seeking imagination be as fixed as the correspondences it is designed to perceive: " Were we to follow Nature, and to form no Associations of Ideas, but where she has fixed a Bond of Union, we should always find that the subordinate Species of Beauty refers to something higher, and that wherever that Reference is over-looked, or the moral Charm sacrificed to an inferior Venus, there the Imagination is riotous, and the true Taste of Life debauched." 17 By this interpretation, the divine analogy both gives philo- sophic validity to art and figurative language and counteracts the charge of science that art is a pleasing deceit; for the true imagination does not fabricate, but discovers the similitudes of the moral and the physical. The divine analogy therefore explained to Cooper the propriety of " adding moral epithets to objects " and illustrating " observations upon the conduct of life, by metaphors drawn from the external scenes of the world." To him " beautiful action " and " solemn grove " are not capriciously fanciful junctions, but have their rationale in a real relationship divinely established and independent of the individual observer. Were there no correspondence of the physi- cal and moral, Turnbull added, the poet could only describe sensory images; but the imagination, like a stereoscope, super- imposes the analogous worlds of nature and moral truth to produce the real three-dimensional universe: " David Fordyce, Diatogues Concerning Education (Cork, 1755, 4th ed.), L 7341, '5Ibid., 264. `'Ibid., 266. 17lIbid., 277.</page><page sequence="10">48 NATURE MORALIZED . .I. such is the analogy between sensible and moral objects, there is none of the latter sort that may not be cloathed with a sensible form or image, and represented to us as it were in a material shape and hue. So true is this, not only are wit and poetry owned to take place only in consequence of this analogy or resemblance of moral and natural ideas; but even all language is confessed to be originally taken from sensible objects, or their properties and effects. But the real truth of the matter . . . is, 'That moral ideas could not at all be expressed by words, if they could not be pic- tured to us by means of analogous sensible objects'. . . . no words can express moral ideas, but so far as there is such an analogy betwixt the natural and moral world, that objects in the latter may be shadowed forth, pictured, or imaged to us by some resemblance to them in the former. It is imagination therefore that renders us capable of social intercourse and commerce, even about moral ideas. . . . And so far as language can go in com- municating sentiments, so far have we an indisputable proof of analogy between the sensible and the moral world; and conse- quently of wonderful wisdom and goodness, in adjusting sensible and moral relations and connexions one to another; the sensible to our minds, and reciprocally the connexions of things that consti- tute the sensible world.18 On the other hand, Fordyce is hesitant to ground poetic lan- guage quite so firmly on the outward nature of things because of the large part that associationism plays in his thinking. If we start from the epistemological, rather than the ontological basis of figurative language and assume that such language springs from a human deficiency in realizing abstract truth, then the function of imagery is only to clarify abstractions, and presumably any imagery that carries out this task will do. But, temporarily accepting this associationism, Fordyce is eager to avoid the implied relativism in the choice of moral imagery and adopts a position midway between the epistemological and the ontological: moral imagery, unlike mere fiction, may be Things are delineated to us, not in Show of Fiction merely, but justly termed a particular Language, or vocal Painting, by which according to their Realities and specific Natures. I term this a Kind of Language, but I may add withal, that it has the advantage of what we strictly call Language. For, whereas there is only an arbitrary Connection between that [i. e., fiction] and the Ideas it has brought to express, there is an obvious, a natural Connection 18 Turnbull, Principles, 54-5. Cp. Turnbull's Treatise on Ancient Painting (Lon- don, 1740), 139.

WASSERMAN 49 and Relation, between this Kind of Language and the Ideas con- veyed by it; nay, that Language is evidently built upon that Con- nection or Similitude.?9 In other words, moral imagery is effective only when there is perfect correspondence between image and its moral analogue, and there is at least the implication that this perfect corre- spondence must therefore exist in the nature of things, and not merely in the mind of man. Actually, Fordyce would like to believe it is more than an implication, and that the origin of art is not a human weakness, but a divine intention: I would chuse to say, that it [the tendency to analogize] is founded on the Analogy of Nature itself, and is grafted on such Principles of our Constitution, as if not strictly virtuous, are yet admirably adapted to serve the Purpose of Virtue. . . . the Deity has stamped the Face of Nature with a great Seal, from whose Impression re- sulted all those Analogies and Relations we find diffused through the universe. There is, especially a general Analogy between natural and moral Things, by which they resemble, and reflect a mutual light upon each other. They are Tallies which answer, if not exactly and in every Point, yet in many Respects, so that the one may be used indifferently for the other, and the Powers or Properties of the one may serve to express those of the other.20 In terms of the ontological analogy, then, the philosophic na- ture of literature can be defended: the divine analogy is a great Enricher of Language, and an obvious Source of the elegant Pleasure we receive from the Descriptions of Poetry, and the Em- bellishments of fine Writing. We are delighted to see inanimate Nature breathe, live and move with Passion; to behold Thought coloured, illuminated, shadowed; Affections personated, embodied, and cloathed with the choicest Drapery of Nature. Upon this Foundation of Analogy, then, is the whole Superstructure of Meta- phor, Allegory, and no small Part of Fable raised.21 Because the properly directed analogizing imagination discovers the highest truths, art easily becomes important in Turnbull's educational theory. If " Moral and natural philosophy . . are indeed, in their nature, as nearly allied as their objects, body and soul," 22 then education, following the procedure of the imagination, should lead from a scientific discovery of har- monies in the physical world to the corresponding harmonies 19 Fordyce, op. cit., I. 335. 2 Ibid., 3s37-8. 21 Ibid., 342. 22 George Turnbull, Observations upon Liberal Education (London, 1742), 352.</page><page sequence="12">50 NATURE MORALIZED that should exist in moral and civil affairs. " Natural phi- losophy, or instruction in the wisdom and goodness of the works of creation and providence, is therefore the first step in teaching and recommending virtue. 23 In this curriculum language and literature are central because in them the analogically related realms are already drawn together. Thus, the study of meta- phorical words " coincides with philosophy," for they reveal the " proper material images for exhibiting moral sentiments in an agreable garb or dress," a power they derive from the correspondences that exist in fact.24 Indeed, " were there not such an extensive analogy between the moral world and the natural, that almost every moral sentiment may be figured or pictured to us under some material semblance, these arts would be utterly unknown to us: There would be no foundation for them in the frame and contexture of things." 25 Not content with limiting this explanation to literature, Turnbull extends it to all the physical arts in his Treatise on Ancient Painting (1740). So strictly are the senses of moral truth and beauty allied, that it is hardly possible to speak of moral Objects in any other Language, than that which expresses the Beauties of the other kind.. . . One of the most pleasing and entertaining Speculations in Philosophy is the universal Analogy that prevails throughout Nature: The Analogy between the natural and moral World in every respect. 'Tis this Analogy that lays the Foundation . . . for what is principle in the Works of Genius, the cloathing moral Objects with sensible Images, or the giving them Bodies, Shapes, and Forms in Description, Sculpture, and Painting.26 The analogical universe, however, is far less stable in the minds of the Shaftesburians than this account suggests. For- dyce and Turnbull are whistling loudly because their convic- tion is growing weaker. Too much reasoning eventually upsets Turnbull's balancing act, and the moral realm is eventually pitched to the side of the physical. By defining " will " so that there is little free will left, he makes nature and free agents merely instruments for the fulfillment of God's laws, which are the same whether we call them moral or physical. Conse- quently, although he is intent upon claiming that " there is a 23Ibid., 356. 24 Ibid., 9263. 25 Ibid. 20 Treatise, 138.</page><page sequence="13">EARL R. WASSERMAN 51 much more exact correspondence and analogy between the natural and moral world . . . than superficial observers are apt to imagine," 27 he allows similarity to become identity. The physical has absorbed the moral, and Turnbull is pointing in the direction of the materialists and the utilitarians: ". . . tho' natural philosophy be commonly distinguished from the moral; all the conclusions in natural philosophy, concerning the order, beauty, and perfection of the material world, belong properly to moral philosophy. . . . In reality, when natural philosophy is carried so far as to reduce phenomena to good general laws, it becomes moral philosophy." 28 He is confessing, in effect, that faith rather than reason is necessary to balance the two worlds perfectly. He had begun with the thesis that the physi- cal is like the moral, but ends with the implication that the physical is the moral. Laws for men become identical with laws of nature, and God's moral attributes turn out to be His physical attributes. Fordyce's wavering arises from other causes. Despite his insistence upon a perfect accord of the physical and moral, the evidences of the divine analogy that he draws upon reflect the interests of the new science and are not static correspond- ences, but dynamic and organic. The Elizabethans found com- fort in learning that just as the highest heavenly bodies are the noblest, so the uppermost part of man, his mind, is the noblest; and that just as the sun, situated in the midst of the heavens, gives light and strength, so the heart, in the midst of the body, animates and enlightens. These are static correspondences and belong to a statically ordered universe. But, although Fordyce's analogically arranged universe is a heritage from the earlier faith, the examples he chooses derive from the physical laws of nature, its modes of operating and ways of becoming: the correspondence between gravitation and benevolence; of the growth of government, of mind, and of plants and animals. This shift of foundations is symptomatic of one of the forces that will destroy the analogical pattern. The root-metaphor of the reflecting mirror or the synchronized machine is being replaced by that of the dynamic force of gravity and the or- ganic growth of the plant. When man comes to realize more 27 Christian Phliosophy (London, 1740), 173. 28 Principles, 8.</page><page sequence="14">52 NATURE MORALIZED vividly that his universe is dynamic and organic, he will then find it necessary to establish a new integration of matter and spirit. Moreover, by introducing associationism, which empha- sizes the subjectivity of truth, Fordyce has unsettled the older view of nature as an open book of ethics and has dampened the pleasure of unriddling the world as an ethical rebus. One catches a sense that the key to the riddle has been lost: " And how connect our Ideas of moral Excellence and Good, with their natural Images and Representatives? This is no easy Task, being one of the nicest Questions in Philosophy." 29 It is in this troubled direction that the psychologizing of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries has been tugging. The tendency is to transfer the analogy from objective reality, where it is fixed, to the human mind, where it appears relative; and Fordyce can check this bent only by urging feebly that a rigorously controlled ethical education will direct the imagina- tion " to unite proper moral Qualities with their corresponding Images and Emblems." 30 Moral imagery, he keeps telling him- self, " has a real Foundation in Nature," and " there is not an arbitrary, but a natural Kind of Connection between the Signs and the Things signified by them 3 but at heart he is grasp- ing after a vanishing faith in a divine scheme, while he secretly suspects it is man-made and that the correspondence is only an imperfect make-shift of the mind to realize its own abstrac- tions. Finally, he knows too well other contemporary analyses of the foundations of analogy, and they have raised more ques- tions than he can answer. By using the dialogue form he can examine analogy from a number of perspectives, and he finds himself able to argue not only that analogy is grounded on the nature of things, but also that only primitive peoples need their abstractions clothed in sensible forms; that the analogy is only a creation of the mind; and even that abstractions cannot be truthfully represented by material forms because the two are different in kind. He can see the analogical pattern from so many inconsistent perspectives that we come to know he does not see it clearly from any one. 29 Fordyce, op. cit., I. 266. 30 Ibid., 275. 81 Ibid., 370, 372.</page><page sequence="15">EARL R. WASSERMAN 53 III These Platonic and Shaftesburian systems of analogy, how- ever, would not be especially important were they not also reflective of, and contributory to, a much broader drift in con- temporary thought. The pervasive deistic drive to reject super- natural revelation placed the orthodox clergy in the uncom- fortable position of either adopting deism or, in defending miracles, to appear to be embracing Catholic fideism. Protes- tantism, being basically rationalistic itself, was therefore forced to adapt itself to the polemical methods of deism, and a large segment of Protestant orthodoxy came to accept the middle position that natural and supernatural revelations are inter- locking systems, not only unopposed, but mutually necessary. And clearly the argument that one may reason alike about the natural and the supernatural can easily lead to the conclusion that the two orders are themselves analogous. This tendency towards an analogy of reasoning about the two is, either ex- plicitly or in colloidal dispersion, the general characteristic of eighteenth-century Anglican orthodoxy. One especially vigorous flurry of theorizing about analogical reasoning involved Bishops William King and Peter Browne, and at its periphery touched Berkeley, Hume, and Bolingbroke, among others. The immediate impetus was the growing anti- rationalism that marked the English rejection of Cartesianism and the Neoplatonism of the Cambridge school. Rationalistic deism had spun a fine web of theology out of the mind of man, but Lockean sensationism and increasing skepticism greatly weakened the authority of reason. Into this skepticism analogi- cal reasoning fitted with nice precision, for it provided a stand- ard for religious truth outside the ratiocinative mind of man, and yet, being grounded on sensory experience, it did not have to resort to innate knowledge of divinity. Moreover, because analogy claims to yield nothing more definitive than probable and proportionate truth, it did not pretend that man can have full and absolute knowledge of divinity, but only what is suf- ficient for his mortal career. A system of analogical thought is indigenous to the skeptical, empirical, and anti-mystical cli- mate of the eighteenth century.32 Because of the Great Chain "2 To a large degree it was on the basis of the analogy of reasoning that War-</page><page sequence="16">54 NATURE MORALIZED of Being, analogical reasoning, Young wrote in Night IThoughts, is " Man's surest guide below " (VI 734). The problem to which Bishops King and Browne addressed themselves was that of defending the reasonableness of Scrip- ture at the same time that they rejected deism by denying the sufficiency of reason. Hence King took the skeptical position that an analogical knowledge of incomprehensibles is sufficient for human existence. Since we are able to describe operations of the mind by physical acts although the two belong to mu- tually exclusive spheres, as when we say that the mind " pene- trates," it is equally valid to describe divine attributes in terms of human ones by the analogy of proper proportion. Although King argues only for the analogy of reasoning, he cannot avoid the hint that the analogy may have some foundation in objec- tive fact: "there is indeed a resemblance and analogy be- tween [mental and physical acts], which makes us give the same Name to each"; and between human and divine at- tributes "there is some analogy and proportion." 33 But he hastens to add that the analogy cannot bear extended analysis. King was conscious of the danger that his thesis might imply that we can have only a metaphoric and therefore a false knowledge of God, and that analogizing from human to divine attributes leads to anthropomorphism. Consequently he fash- ioned a distinction between metaphor and analogy, just as burton read and justified Pope's Essay on Man (A Critical and Philosophical Com- mentary on Mr. Pope's Essay on Man, London, 1742). Pope's statement that we can reason of God only by what we know of our world he interprets as mean- ing that "from the visible Things of God, in this System " Pope will " demon- strate the invisible Things of God, his eternal Power and Godhead" (p. 4) Con- sistently Warburton frees Pope from Crousaz' accusation of materialism by pointing out that the poet is not confusing the material with the moral and divine, but is using it for an analogical argument, as, for example, in reasoning from physical evil to moral evil (pp. 15-16, 23, 37, 105-6, etc.). Finally, in this use of analogical reasoning in poetry Warburton perceives a very special kind of poetic procedure. Commenting on Pope's comparison of the motions of the planets and the motions of the soul, he writes that the poet "b ath the Art of converting Poetical Orna- inents into Philosophic Reasoning; and of improving a Simile into an Analogical Argument" (p. 137). It is probably because of this fusion of simile and analogical reasoning that Warburton finds in Pope " a new Species of the Sublime . . . so new that we have yet no Name for it, tho' of a Nature distinct from every other poetical Excellence " (pp. 74-5). This species combines wit (simile) and sublimity (analogical progress from the visible to the invisible). " This seems to be the last Effort of the Imagination, to poetical Perfection " (p. 75). 3 King, " Divine Predestination," 7th ed., in Essay on the Origin of Evil (Cam- bridge, 1758), 485.</page><page sequence="17">EARL R. WASSERMAN 55 the Shaftesburians did between fanciful and true associations: metaphor is a relation of things already known in order to affect the passions, and hence may deceive; analogy throws light on the otherwise unknowable by means of the known. Metaphor heightens small things by greater; analogy uses the lesser to clarify what " have more Reality and Perfection in them, than the things by which we represent them. Thus weighing a thing in our Minds, is a much more noble and per- fect Action, than examining the Gravity of a Body by Scale and Balance....' 34 To this, Bishop Browne, despite his three volumes on the subject, added little, except to introduce all the subtleties of the Thomistic system of the analogy of proper proportion. He labored, however, to remove the implication that analogical knowledge of God is fanciful and therefore false, by discriminating further between metaphor and analogy. The divine analogy, unlike metaphor, "is an Actual Similitude and a Real Correspondency in the very Nature of Things." 3 It is unnecessary, however, to follow Browne in his endless subtleties as he weaves his way through analogies univocal and equivocal, proportional and attributive. It is sufficient to note in his books the extent to which the divine analogy, sown by the Thomistic tradition, is rooted in English religious thought, and the degree to which its rationale and implications were being examined. The popularity of the analogical system sug- gests that it would have been difficult to suppose that man has more than an analogical knowledge of spiritual values; and yet, after King and Browne, it would have been an act of great daring to chance a spiritual analogue boldly and without careful discrimination. The subtleties forced upon King and Browne were inevitable so long as they bowed to the deists in conceiving of analogy as a way of discovery by progress from the known to the unknown. John Ellis, on the other hand, easily freed himself from the philosophic fly-paper by considering analogy only as a means of communicating knowledge gained from revelation.

But since the understanding can know only by the senses, it cannot know the real nature of incorporeal things, except " darkly, as they are represented to us by analogy to ideas of sensation." 37 Na- ture does not rise analogically to spiritual truths; God con- descends to suggest them vaguely " by metaphor, analogy, and similitude to objects better known to us." 38 The problems of analogical reasoning continued to trouble the age, for it could neither solve nor neglect them. At one extreme it was felt that the skepticism of King and Browne was excessive, and Joseph Jackson, for example, replied that physi- cal qualities and God's perfections differ in degree, not in kind. Therefore, there must be allow'd to be such an Analogy between the natural unintelligent and intellectual Properties of all Beings, from the highest to the lowest, that from the Ideas of the one we may form real and true Ideas of the other in some Proportion and Degree or other; that from human Existence and Properties we may form Ideas not only of corporeal Things, but also of the Divine Existence and Properties. . .. s John Ellis, The Knowledge of Divine Things from Revelation, not from Reason or Nature (London, 18S7; Ist ed., 1743), 69. 37ibid., 80.

See Bishop Peter Browne's analysis of Hildrop's system (Things Divine and Supernatural, 104-10). Browne examines in this volume a number of contemporary treatises on analogy, not all of which I have been able to ideiitify. Richard Fiddes, although rejecting the Shaftesburian theme that the physical order is proof of the moral and divine orders, admitted that one may " illustrate " the others: "There is something in the Action of Man considered as a moral Agent, if not strictly the same with what we observe in material Operations, which, however, bears a visible Resemblance to them " (A General Treatise of Morality, London, 1724, p. 13). The assumption behind this relationship is that God moves everywhere " by the most simple, the most direct, and practicable Means " (p. 14).

WASSERMAN 57 Likewise, Berkeley, as learned as Browne in the Scholastic tradition, accepted in his Alciphron the distinction between metaphor and analogy, but stressed the positive knowledge yielded by the analogy of humanly conceived perfections and divine attributes. It appears likely that in his earlier years Berkeley had accepted an even more definite analogical rela- tionship, ontological rather than epistemological; for in one of the Guardian essays attributed to him an extended comparison is drawn between physical gravity, benevolence, and social at- traction on the grounds that throughout " the moral and intel- lectual, as well as the natural and corporeal " there is " a cer- tain correspondence of parts, a similitude of operation, and unity of design."1 40 At the opposite pole Hume threw a dark shadow of doubt over the entire subject. The natural attributes of God manifest in the physical universe " probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence," but even this slight correspondence will not apply to God's moral attributes and human virtues.41 Analogical reasoning therefore has little real value. Anthony Collins and Bolingbroke would not allow even this much. As analogy approaches or departs from identity, Bolingbroke protested, it proportionately yields an anthro- pomorphic deity or merely deceptive figures of speech.42 The impression the controversy leaves is that the age was ill at ease and hesitant to follow the argument to its obvious implications; yet the space and vigor that Hume, Bolingbroke, and Collins devoted to the subject indicate how formidable the analogical argument was in the thought of the period. Analogy was found to have an ontological foundation-or only an epistemological one. The epistemological analogy applies to the physical and divine orders-or only to human abstractions and divine at- tributes. And analogies are valid-or valid only because of mane's necessary ignorance-or untrustworthy-or entirely false. Amidst such confusion it is not surprising that Bishop Butler should have chosen to build his defense of orthodoxy upon an analogy, and that his success is attributable to the fine caution with which he employed this theme and to the very modest claims he made for it.

Most of his correspondences were contemporary commonplaces, for it is neither his analogy of reasoning nor his evidence that is novel, but the end to which he directed them. This and the next life are analogized; sleep and death; the governments of the physical, moral, civil, and domestic worlds; physical and spiritual growth. In general, "the course of Nature . . . furnishes us with a real practical proof of the obligations of Religion." Butler's coup de main, however, is his use of these commonplace analogies, not to prove that the course of nature demonstrates the divine plan and therefore is the wise substitute of Providence-a dangerous concession to make to the deists,-but that natural and re- vealed religion do not contradict each other and offer equal difficulties. This is his coquettish method of conquest by advance and absorptive retreat. An impressive analogical argu- ment is developed, and then, instead of risking victory on an appended QED, Butler modestly claims only that the natural evidence suggests the probability of the revealed truth and shows it to be credible. For example, that we perceive only a small part of the total pattern of nature suggests that our ignorance is no argument against the reality of a moral plan. The positive value of the analogy lies only in that the physical can suggest a spiritual concept as a hypothesis; or the analogy is valuable negatively in making incredible the false ways of reasoning in spiritual matters. Butler's hesitation to make more than the most modest claims for the value of analogy is significant of the rapid crum- bling of the static and tightly patterned universe. His world- picture is still the pyramidal one of parallel and corresponding planes, all harmoniously attuned; and at times he explicitly describes it: " the natural and moral constitution and govern- ment of the world are so connected, as to make up together but one scheme: and it is highly probable, that the first is formed and carried on merely in subservience to the latter." 44 But even this blunt account is introduced mainly to support "3Analogy of Religion, in Works, ed. J. H. Bernard (London, 1900), II. 65. "'Ibid., 121.</page><page sequence="21">EARL R. WASSERMAN 59 the thesis that our knowledge of the total moral scheme must necessarily be as incomplete as our knowledge of the total physical scheme. Many, no doubt, read into Butler's book an elaboration of the divine analogy itself; in the epitaph Southey prepared for Butler's tomb in 1834 the bishop is eulogized for having found " in outward and visible things / The type and evidence of those within the veil." But this distorts Butler's emphasis. The analogical universe had become an outworn creed; it lingered because it had behind it the force of tradi- tion, but man's faith in it, and the spiritual security it had once provided had been evaporating. As though to prove that, while the analogical structure was the only cosmology at hand, it could be leaned on no more heavily than Butler had done, Richard Barton pursued a simi- lar argument in his Analogy of Divine WVisdom in the Material, Sensitive, Moral, Civil, and Spiritual Systent of Things (1747) . Unlike Butler, however, he stressed the real analogy of the various levels rather than the analogy of reasoniiw:; and the positive, instead of the negative, value of this reasoning. The book stirred hardly a ripple-not because it was felt to be extravagant in insisting upon the reality of the analogy (this was an inconsequential matter), but, as one reviewer put it, because Barton had failed to use the analogies " to show that the procedure of the divine conduct " at one level does " very much illustrate and vindicate his procedure in others." 4 Once the pattern had given the comforting sense of a total divine system; this skeptical age was asking: Right or wrong, how much comfort will the hypothesis provide us? Barton established his groundwork for the divine analogy by reducing the difference between the natural and moral works of God simply to the difference between freedom and absence of choice. Since the differences are so slight and the resem- blances in springing from the same source so strono', "that which may lead us to the knowledge of many of the laws of God, as rules of behaviour to free ceatures, is Analogy: And this analogy lies not only, between the several classes of intel- ligent beings, or moral agents, but also between them and natural productions.... We may argue by analogy from tem- poral concerns to spiritual; . . . and drawv proofs of the divine "Monthly Review, III (1750), 264.</page><page sequence="22">60 NATURE MORALIZED will, from the analogy of his purpose in the material world, compared with those of the moral." 46 Therefore, the value of scientific discoveries is that they bind material and spiritual analogues even more closely together: " Xhen the laws of the material world are better known . .. WISDOM will be found a glorious and homogene thing; and the laws of spiritual and material beings, of God, Angels, brutes and insensible matter, more similar and a-kin, than has hitherto been explained, or perhaps conceived." "I Here is something of the bold sweep of the Renaissance, but it is still more an intellectual hope than a spiritual conviction. Barton has no hesitation in documenting his thesis with elaborate examples, for the subject of analogy, he wrote, " is extremely copious, and men have gone but a little way in it as yet." 48 If men knew how to read it, all crea- tion, " nay, every lump of matter, is a lesson of divine truths." 49 Barton thus freed himself to analogize, not only large, vague areas such as the evil, growth, and government of the natural and the moral, but, more specifically, the light of the sun and the light of revelation, gravitation and the spirit of grace, the universal ether and the infinite divine spirit; and, with a sense of delight in his own wit, he tested these analogies in a variety of their manifestations, pleased to find his thesis still intact. So harmoniously do the two parts of these correspondences fit together, " the language belonging to one, may, with great propriety, be transferred to the other; and a comparison may be made, without a duplicity of expression." 50 But despite this conviction of an elaborate network of corre- spondences, Barton had trepidations that sprang from the new science and psychology. Since God created the correspond- ences, he granted man wit, a passion for searching them out. Wit and judgment, however, often are at strife; and the uncon- trolled wit is likely to find only fanciful analogies or to con- fuse similarity and identity to the point of pantheism.51 Barton therefore followed the general spirit of the Royal Society with respect to language by distinguishing between true and merely poetic analogy: "Analogy, which may lead to beauties in 46Analogy of Divine Wisdom (Dublin, 1750, 2nd ed.), 61. 47 Ibid., 34-5. 48 Ibid., 34. 49lbid., 44. 60 Ibid., 71. 5t Ibid.. 59.</page><page sequence="23">EARL R. WASSERMAN 61 poetry may also lead to great errors in philosophy . . .; but if used with a good judgment, it may be made the foundation for useful knowledge." 52 This double standard for similes is the consequence of the fusion of the two traditions, the rhetori- ,al and the analogical, or the psychological and the ontological; and it is suggestive of the difficulty of the age in deciding whether the basis of figurative language lies within or without man.53 At any rate, Barton obviously had little faith in man's ability to find true analogies without divine aid. " The follow- ing Analogies," he wrote at the beginning of his book, " are all, except for one part, drawn up under scriptural heads, to pre- vent the luxuriance of fancy; lest imagination should wander into enthusiastical conceits, without foundation on the divine word." 14 Butler's mild parallelism of the spiritual, moral, and physical served nicely to support another tradition of analogy handed down mainly by Bishop Thomas Burnet and maintained by other progressivists bent upon reconciling the two revelations. In order to bring the idea of progress into accord with that of the Fall, Burnet used the divine analogy to postulate a parallel progressive improvement of the moral order, the physical uni- verse, and man's scientific knowledge of the universe. Nature and moral truth sing a divine duet as they move hand-in-hand towards the millennium. Consequently science is an aid to re- ligion, for man's increasing scientific knowledge is part of the divine plan of gradual revelation; by pre-establishing an accord of the two worlds, God made it possible that spiritual truths be explicated proportionately as man gains greater knowledge of the natural world. "This seems to me to be the great Art of Divine Providence," Burnet wrote, "so to adjust the two Worlds, Humane and Natural, Material and Intellectual ... they should all along correspond and fit one another...." Since both natural and moral phenomena are part of the order established by God, they run the same course and are so pro- portional to each other that man's moral and spiritual states may be gauged by examining the condition of nature. 52Ibid.,58.

The argument differs little from Butler's except that the analogy, instead of being static, is placed in a chronological context to form a total history of nature and supernatural revelation. If one could grant Butler the divine analogy to support a negativistic defense of ortho- doxy, then the analogy of the natural and supernatural could perhaps be granted for a more positive defense if it is drawn out into a total history of the fall and redemption of spirit and matter. The basis of this correspondence, as stated by William Worthington, is that God so interwove the natural and moral worlds that no change could be made in one without similar effect in the other?6 Consequently, " such is the con- nection between the moral and natural world, that they are inseparable in their fates "; and so " the experience of testi- mony [about miracles], and the experience of the laws of nature, harmonize, and cooperate with, each other: So that each, not only remains in its full force; but, being united, they mutually corroborate one another. . . P . James Tunstall, whose book is designed to show " the certainty, distinction, and connection of Natural and Revealed Religion," added that " Every ad- vance . . . in the observation of nature carries with it a propor- tioiial improvement of the moral science.... The certainty of it is most satisfactorily evinced, when we discern an uniform and established analogy between [the] natural constitution, which our senses perceive, and that moral constitution, which religion supposes." 58 By this means the progressivists could coordinate the disappearance of miracles in the later times of man (an argument used by the deists to discredit miracles) with man's gradual improvement in science; for the increasing knowledge of nature, which is God's commentary on His direct teachings, proportionately allows the use of human faculties to understand scriptural truths. 58 Essay on the Scheme . . . of Man's Redemption (London, 1748, and ed.), 33.

WASSERMAN 63 This fusion of the analogical systems of Burnet and Butler was developed most fully by Henry Owen and Edmund Law, both millennialist reconcilers of deisn and orthodoxy. The workings of nature and the moral spirit, Owen claimed, follow the same laws and move to the same end, being merely different manifestations of God's one moral system. " To be convinced of this, we need only attend to the striking analogy, that sub- sists between them "; 59 and hence he agreed with Pope that we must judge of moral as of natural things. The end to which all these millennialists put what Law, echoing Butler, called "that perfect Analogy between Religion and the common course of Nature," 60 was to prove that revelation is progres- sive, but the tradition on which they built and which they helped maintain was an inheritance from the pre-Baconian world. IV Out of the physico-theology of such men as Burnet also grew the largest single school of analogists. In many ways, the founder, John Hutchinson, eccentric though he was, accepted the major intellectual tendencies of his day. He was vigorously anti-rationalistic, insisted that science is the key to spiritual knowledge, and yet claimed that the source of all spiritual truth must be supernatural revelation alone. Consequently he dedicated himself to demonstrating the literal truth of the Bible on the thesis that Scripture is scientific, and science Scriptural. But to bring this about required sleight of hand in both areas, and Hutchinson resorted to alarming subtleties in Hebrew philology and to scientific discoveries peculiarly his own. His work, cspecially in Hebrew philology, was so mis- guided as to bring nearly universal repudiation, but, his central thesis proved attractive to many students at both universities, some of whom became scholars and divines of importance.?9 The Intent and Propriety of the Scripture Miracles (London, 1773), I. 6. 60 Considerations on the State of the WTorld (Cambridge, 1745), 18?. 6 In addition to the authors mentioned here, see also John Dove, A Creed Founded on Truth and Common, Sense (London, 1750); Samuel Pike, Philosophia Sacra (London, 17.3), esp. p. 13; William Romaine, Works (London, 1813). The influence of the school persisted well into the nineteenth century. It seems most likely, for example, that Keats' friend Benjamin Bailey derived from the Ilutchin- sonians his faith in the divine analogy. See his Discourse Insscribed to the Memory of the Princess Charlotte (1817) and The Keats Circlead. Hyder E. Rollins (Cambridge, Mass., 1948), I. 8.</page><page sequence="26">64 NATURE MORALIZED The doctrine they all retained, despite its uncomfortable asso- ciation with the word " Hutchinsonian," was that the figures in the Bible are not " Eastern " ornaments, but are functionally meaningful. Therefore they exerted themselves to show that the Bible is everywhere in accord with science, and thus that nature's characteristics are analogous to divine truths. Nature does not have independent value in teaching spiritual truths, but because of the analogy it serves as a necessary commen- tary on Scripture. The heart of the scheme, according to William Jones of Nayland, is that " Between that philosophy which maintains the agency of the heaven upon the earth, and the religion revealed to us in the Bible, there is a rela- tion which renders them both more credible. . . . Many in this age see the force of that great argument in favor of Chris- tianity, which is drawn from the analogy between the king- dom of nature and the kingdom of grace. ... 62 To this Bishop Horne added that the natural and spiritual worlds " tally in all particulars " and that the use of this knowledge is " a key to nature and the SS, teaching all men to draw the intended instruction from both." 63 In the Sophron of Henry Lee the main thesis of this school is fully examined. As sensory creatures, we can know only material things, and the invisible things of God must therefore be supernaturally revealed. Empiricists and revelationists are both right. But it is illogical that God should teach us through our one means of knowledge, our senses, what is not agreeable to revelation. Therefore, nature must be the analogue of revelation and an explication of it; for the " visible world is and . . . was made to be a daily rehearsal of the scriptural scheme to the senses," and " the Christian revelation is the application of the several parts of [naturel to illustrate this scheme." 64 Not only is nature " one grand complex idea or representation of another spiritual sys- tem," every part of one pointing " to its corresponding scene in this other," 65 but, indeed, the existence of anything in nature implies the necessary existence of its spiritual counterpart. The contemplation of nature, then, should be an act of religious devotion, since " to follow nature is to follow Christ." 66 Nature 62 Works of the Right Reverend George Horne (New York, 1848), I. 74. 83 Ibid. 4 Sophron (London, 1760, 2nd ed.), I Ili.

With thankful tribute for such a way through na- ture up to truth, let us attend nature's representation. 67 In effect, nature is a statement of divine truths, and the percep- tion of nature may, indeed should, be a spiritual experience. Here we are close to the position Jonathan Edwards reached through his similar participation in the major currents of eighteenth-century thought, especially through his reading of the Shaftesburians and the millennialists.68 Edwards, pursuing the implications of the divine analogy one step farther, was willing to discover the spiritual meaning of nature without direct reference to Scripture, but in distinguishing between rhetorical similitude and the image viewed spiritually because it is a statement of a spiritual analogue, he is simply in the main line of English thought. Like Edwards, Jones also leaned towards symbolism when he distinguished between mere words and the Biblical language, " which doth not consist of words, but of signs or figures taken from visible things." 69 Words are arbitrary signs of things, but, because of the divine analogy, the language of revelation " uses some things as the signs of other things; in consequence of which, the world which we now see becomes a sort of commentary on the mind of God, and explains the world in which we believe." 7 God, then, is for- ever speaking His language of things to man's " spiritual sense," for " as the visible world throughout is a pattern of the in- visible, the figures of the sacred language built upon the images of nature, are as extensive as the world itself." 7' Man needs only to read this language as value instead of thing: "To those who consider only how the creation can furnish matter to their lusts and passions, it is no better than a vain shadow: but to those who take it rightly, it is a shadow of heavenly 67 Ibid., I. 133.

Since this delight is also the motive behind all the arts and is com- parable to the supreme delight of comparing the visible and spiritual worlds, poetry is one of the greatest human expres- sions because it conforms to God's way of delivering precepts by analogous images of things, which are shadows of truth.74 Nature, Jones added, " is Christian, and the world itself a daily miracle "; 75 and poetry, progressing from natural image to spiritual analogue, is man's effort to meditate upon this world as a miraculous figure of truth. The problems of an irresponsible imagination and false figures troubled the Hutchinsonians very little. Lee distinguished be- tween metaphor and analogy exactly as King and Browne had done, analogy being controlled by " the reality of the system of grace and of its correspondency with the oeconomy of God in nature." 76 Apparently each natural image can have only one spiritual value, and if we fall into error it is attributable to our insufficient scientific knowledge rather than our fancy. On the basis of this version of the divine analogy Lee built his treatise, somewhat reminiscent of the prose of James Hervey, developing spiritual values from the nature of sleep, sun, and night, the growth of trees, the ugliness of the owl. Jones of Nayland studied the language of Scriptures, explaining the meaning of the Trinity and the spiritual significance of spring; and, very much in the manner of Jonathan Edwards' Images or Shadows of Divine Things, wrote his Book of Nature, or the True Sense of Things as a " grammar," not of words, but of " things; to be conceived by the imagination, and applied by the understanding, for the improvement of the heart in divine and moral wisdom." 77 And Bishop Horne annotated the psalms in terms of the theme that " the visible works of God 72 Ibid., 72. 73 Ibid., 245. 74 Ibid., 242-5. `5 Ibid., 246. 76 Sophron, III. 849. 77 Works, XI. xii.</page><page sequence="29">EARL R. WASSERMAN 67 give us ideas, by analogy, of the mysteries of faith." 78 The age must have been clearly conscious that the divine analogy was a large unit-idea in contemporary thought, for Lee found himself in agreement, not only with his fellow Hut- *chinsonians, but also with such other major exponents of the doctrine as John Ellis and Bishops Browne, King, and Butler. In one fashion or another, most eighteenth-century philosophic roads led to the divine analogy.79 V In the eighteenth century, then, there is to be found the last significant vestige of the myth of an analogically ordered uni- verse, but greatly weakened by the rhetorical tradition, associa- tionism, and science, all of which had become of far greater importance than the heritage of correspondences. The divine analogy had to compete with the beliefs that figurative lan- guage is mere ornamentation, and that figures have their origin only in the ways of the mind; and in the battle it had become enervate as it waited to be replaced by other world-schemes for relating matter and spirit. In the seventeenth century Emanuele Tesauro had pictured God as a " witty speaker, who, talking in riddles to Men and Angels, clothed his most exalted concepts with various heroical Devices, and pictorial Symbols "; and Father Juan Eusebio Nieremberg had added to Plotinus' description of the world as the poetry of God the belief that " this Poem is like a labyrinth, which is read in every direc- tion, and gives intimation of, and points to its Author." 80 In the Renaissance the confluence of Thomism and revived Neo- platonism encouraged a search for parallels everywhere: it produced a Paracelsus and his fellow Hermetic philosophers; it appeared in numerology, herbalism, alchemy, astrology, political theory, and emblem literature.

But by the end of the eighteenth century the loss of faith in the divine analogy prevented the high imagination from freely flying as she was wont of old. What small vestige of the older view still re- mained in critical theory had been almost entirely absorbed by the associational psychology, and consequently served to ex- plain only certain relationships between the material world and qualities of mind, not the relationship of the physical, moral, and spiritual. Correspondences had become a phase of psychology, not ontology. Archibald Alison, for example, turned to the analogy only to fill a loophole in his psychology: those relations between matter and human affections that cannot be explained causally or by association are to be explained by an analogy " which has everywhere been felt between the qualities of matter and of mind, and by which the former becomes so powerfully expressive to us of the latter." 81 But he can do no more than assume the existence of such a relationship. Francis Jeffrey, therefore, building upon the doctrines of Alison, had access to only the theory of the divine analogy; its spiritual and intellectual foundation had been forgotten, and his mystification becomes obvious when he tries to fit the analogy into a framework of associationism. Like Alison, he distinguished between causal and associative rela- tions of matter and mental modes, and those based upon a rela- tion " which external objects may bear to our internal feelings ... in consequence of a sort of resemblance or analogy which they seem to have to their natural and appropriate objects." 82 But even his language shows that he cannot understand how this analogy comes about. Although he felt that " the Lan- guage of Poetry is founded, in a great degree, upon this analogy," and that the poet differs from ordinary men in his greater ability to perceive these objective correlatives, he failed to recognize a divine plan behind the pattern. Neverthless, Jeffrey's theory of poetry is an inheritance from the analogists; but whereas Tesauro exulted in a deity who encourages even the most extravagant analogizing, Jeffrey is only baffled and " Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste (Edinburgh, 1817, Mth ed.), II. 420. 82 Contributions to the Edinburgh Review (London, 1853), 22.</page><page sequence="31">EARL R.

The very essence of poetry, he wrote, " consisLs in -the fine perception and vivid expression of that subtle and mysterious Analogy which exists between the physical and the moral world-which makes out- ward things and qualities the natural types and emblems of inward gifts and emotions.... The feelings of this analogy, obscure and inexplicable as the theory of it may be, are so deep and universal in our nature, that it has stamped itself on the ordinary language of men of every kindred and speech. . ." 83 In the 1805 version of the Prelude, Wordsworth, prob- ably with Alison in mind, wrote briefly of Nature's secondary grace, That outward illustration which is here, The charm more superficial, and yet sweet Which from her works finds way, contemplated As they hold forth a genuine counterpart And softening mirror of the moral world. (XIII. 282-8) This power inherent in nature to reflect the moral world, how- ever, is listed hurriedly among the minor topics that Words- worth felt he had been forced to omit in the pursuit of his major theme; and by 1850 Wordsworth had considerably softened the ontological basis of the analogy: The charm more superficial that attends Her works, as they present to Fancy's choice Apt illustrations of the nioral world, Caught at a glance, or traced with curious pains. (XIV. 317-20) Whatever there was of a concept of the divine analogy in the 1805 version has been edged out, and the later version implies that the fancy makes the analogy by choosing the most appro- priate of nature's multiple forms.84 VI Although critical theory tended to concentrate upon the rhetorical and psychological bases of patterns, it is neverthe- `3 Ibid., 607.

I should like to apply this proposal to the structure of the descriptive poetry, not because the descriptive poetry is a special case, but because here the divine analogy seems most easily applied. It has been almost traditional to describe the eighteenth- century nature poet as a sensitive spirit yearning to paint the beauties of the rural scene, but forced by his misguided audi- ence to surround his work with extraneous and unpoetic mor- alizing. A recognition of the large part played by the divine analogy in the thought of the age, however, suggests a more intimate relation of description and moralizing in poems of the order of Thomson's Seasons. Mere description would represent only half of the divine scheme, and direct moralizing would be contrary to the faculties of man and to God's method of sensory revelation. The didactic passages are not, then, fines paid the public to allow the poet to enjoy an illicit nature-love, but are functional to his total meaning and necessary to the complete- ness of his art. Both halves of the divine analogy are equally important in Richard Jago's " Edge-Hill," in which, the sub- title tells us, the rural prospect is " delineated and moralized." Teach me, he implores, " to the visual join the mental search." The assumption is that these are not unrelated acts, but analogues, for what is delineated has a real correspondence to moral values, and the poet is reading nature's meaning, not fabricating it. Francis Fawkes, for example, celebrated the beauties of autumn, but his theme was not fulfilled until in the second half of his ode, echoing the first, he found the spiritual parallel in man's progress from the placid autumn of life, beyond its winter, to another spring, which will " eternal bloom." 85 Similarly, in his descriptive poem Paradise (1769) John Ogilvie intended to emphasize the " vein of moral senti- ment " that arises " naturally from the subject," and his impli- cation is that the moral value is, in accordance with a divine plan, the analogue of the scene. Indeed, in his " Elegy on Man," which develops the theme of immortality by analogy with the constant revitalization of matter, Jago directly referred to Butler's Analogy for support.

WASSERMAN 71 True, one feels sharply the grinding of the gears in Jago's "Edge-Hill " as the poet shifts from delineating to moralizing: Say, now my dear companions! for enough Of leisure to descriptive song is giv'n; Say, shall we, ere we part, with moral eye, The scene review . . .? Or when John Cunningham first paints: That branching grove of dusky green Conceals the azure sky, Save where a starry space between Relieves the darken'd eye; and then reexamines the scene morally: Old error thus with shades impure Throws sacred truth behind: Yet sometimes, through the deep obscure, She bursts upon the mind.83 But undoubtedly the divine analogy itself was responsible for this characteristic disjunction. In the Elizabethan mind the assumption of the analogy lay beneath the level of conscious- ness, and Shakespeare's King Richard appears " As doth the blushing discontented sun " because the proportional relation of king and sun preexists in the poet's scheme of things. But the work of the eighteenth-century theorists was to make the age conscious of analogy. No longer thinking analogically, but consciously thinking about thinking analogically, it had split a unified concept into its two component parts and into two separate but related events. Analogy is no longer a frame of mind for meaningful perception, but a pattern for chronological procedure; metaphor has yielded to simile as the key structural figure, and nature and moral truth belong on different sides of the same equation. Hence the characteristic bipartite structure of the descriptive poetry of Dyer, Pattison, John Gilbert Cooper, of the descriptive prose of James Hervey, and many others.87 After much descriptive painting, Jago halts to caution 86 " The Contemplatist." " Hervey employs descriptions of nature to demonstrate the existence of the Creator by the argument from design, and also finds evidence of God's attributes in the qualities of his physical works; but, like Thomson, he also sees nature as emblematic of moral and spiritual values. This tendency towards a spiritualizing</page><page sequence="34">72 NATURE MORALIZED against lolling too long by the murm'ring stream and invites us to " expatiate free / O'er nature's moral plan." Because of the analogy, Henry Lee wrote, the visible world is not to be " idly and unprofitably gazed at in our journey through it," but we are to discover the " correspondence of scripture with nature. 88 The effect of the divine analogy in encouraging a bipartite poetic pattern, the two parts analogically echoing each other, is apparent everywhere, but William Pattison's The Morning Contemplation," like Cunningham's " The Contemplatist," is one of the more obvious examples. The entire poem is de- veloped by repetitions of the pattern upon which the following lines are built: Nature's plain instructions learn. See this river, as it goes, With what eloquence it flows? How clear the water, and how fine! How deep, how rapidly serene! But should it fearful of decay, Stagnate, and stop up its way; No longer would its streams appear, Wholesome, delicate, or clear: But bury'd in a quagmire sink, Or in a chocking deluge stink. Believe me, life's the very same, The very image of this stream: If of future fortune fearless, If of present changes, careless, It uninterrupted goes, How sweet! and how serene it flows! But if stopt with these restraints, of nature is even more pronounced in the prose of his disciple Richard Pearsall (Contemplations on the Ocean, Harvest . . ., London, 1753; Contemplations on Butterflies . . . London, 1758). After a physical examination of the scene or natural object, Pearsall then discovers by a spiritual, contemplative review that a labyrinthine path through a wood is emblematic of life, that the disintegration of a captured butterfly is emblematic of the acquisition of glittering worldly things, etc. "Too frequent Converse with the Things of Sense," he writes, "carnalizes the Soul; but it is good, it is necessary, through them, as through a transparent Veil, to look to Objects which are Spiritual and Eternal" (Contemplations on the Ocean, p. iii). This does not, however, imply symbolism or pantheism: totally distinct perceptive acts read object now as thing and now as value, and Pearsall orders his rhetoric to keep the two apart. 8 Sophron, I. lvii.</page><page sequence="35">EARL R. WASSERMAN 73 Present ills, and future wants; If anxious doubts, and clogging care, Betray our reason to despair; Life's dull enjoyment only cloys, And painfully itself destroys. It is not a desire to convert a personal appetite for groves and storms into a public virtue that causes the poet to moralize his rural song, but a world-picture that has left him no other means to objectify his values. The too-great consciousness of the analogical structure and a sense of the uncertainties that sur- round it are reflected in the poet's caution as he moves deliber- ately from image to meaning, carefully marking the separation lest the image become pantheistic, or symbolic, or merely fanci- ful. And for the same reason the poetry fails to be esthetically satisfying, for the need to separate the description from the corresponding moral values prevents the poet from ordering his materials into organic relationships. At best, each side of the equation can be integrated within itself, but imagery and values cannot be " interinanimated " to create a self-contained poetic life. So much had the age lost the ability to move with certainty and easy abandon within the analogical framework that James Fortescue hopefully wrote a poem " in the analogi- cal and moral " kind to show " in some measure . . . that sensible images may be made to shadow forth truths of an abstracted nature; and that the appearance of the moral world may be illustrated by those of the natural." 9 The result is the customary division of description and moral analogue, the images being the universal and customarily observed aspects of nature, the moral analogue being safely platitudinous. A few poets like John Dyer managed to rise above the con- fines of analogy and to make a graceful transition from one poetic referent to another. In " Grongar Hill " the progress, tempo, and destination of the river are like those of human life: " Thus is nature's vesture wrought, / To instruct our wand'ring thought." And a fairly subtle analogy is founded on the diminutive appearance of hedges and meadows seen at a distance: 89 A View of Life in its Several Passions (London, 1749).</page><page sequence="36">74 NATURE MORALIZED A step methinks may pass the stream, So little distant dangers seem; So we mistake the future's facp, Ey'd thro' hope's deluding glass; As yon summits soft and fair Clad in colours of the air, Which to those who journey near, Barren, brown, and rough appear; Still we tread the same coarse way, The present's still a cloudy day. Cooper also managed a somewhat tighter integration of image and value, but it is clear that the analogy will not allow the image to contain the value fully within itself: Nor let vain wit's deceitful glory Lead you from wisdom's path astray; In yonder mead behold that vapour Whose vivid beams illusive play, Far off it seems a friendly taper To guide the traveller on his way; But should some hapless wretch pursuing Tread where the treach'rous meteors glow, He'd find, too late his rashness rueing, That fatal quicksands lurk below.90 But the general tenor of the eighteenth-century analogical poem-unfortunately-is typified by William Stevenson's " Elegy on the Cutting down of an Oak," which completely exhausts the meanings to be drawn from this sad execution." " " A Father's Advice to his Son." 91 It would, of course, be futile to attempt to list the eighteenth-century poems in the analogical pattern; however, a few representative ones, chosen almost at random, are "Studley-Park," in Thomas Gent, The Antient . . . History . . . of Rippon (York, 1733); [Elizabeth Carter], " Written Extempore on the Sea Shore," Poems on Several Occasions (London, 1762), 38; George Wright, The Rural Chris- tian (London, 1776); [Thomas Gisborne], Walks in a Forest (London, 1794), 1-3, 50-52; Charlotte Smith, Elegiac Sonnets (London, 1795, 7th ed.), sonnets 58, 59; John Gisborne, The Vales of HWever (London, 1797), 76-7; John Marriott, "The Falling Leaf," A Short Account (Doncaster, 1803); S. J. Pratt, " Ode to the Sun," Sympathy (London, 1807). One of the most striking evidences of the analogical mode appears in Percival Stockdale's " Ode to a Rivulet " (Miscellanies in Prose and Verse, London, 1778), which purports to be " translated " from the Spanish of Diego de Saavedra (see Republica Literaria, in Cldsicos Castellanos, Madrid, 1922, XLVI. 136). The original poem is essentially a personification of the river, the impersonated figure having the virtues of the Golden Age.

WASSERMAN 75 Man should test his strength before launching a bold plan, a lesson to be learned of the birds because of the analogy of ani- mal instinct and human reason. Trees, too, " represent the characters of men," and from the oak we may learn to be manly. The confusion of the shrubs when the shelter of the tree is gone is analogous to the mourning of the man who has lost his patron. And finally Stevenson admits that although his subject has been the fate of the tree, his true theme has been moral and spiritual affairs, because Nature is eager that "Her works with human acts should correspond." In this admission we may see the difference between the analogical figure and the subjective use of imagery that was rapidly replacing it. The ontological figure rises out of a func- tion of the image. The umbrageous tree is not felt to be like a patron, but is understood to bear proportionately the func- tional relation to the shrub that the patron does to the object of his patronage. The eighteenth-century analogist was striv- ing to report " truth and reason . . . as they are reflected in the glass of the visible forms, and sensible qualities of outward things." 92 The image is not specially shaped and controlled by the creative mind so that it will take on the power of an emblem. But the whole bent of eighteenth-century esthetics- associationism and theories of the sublime and picturesque, for instance-was to root the relationship of image and value in an emotive act instead of an outward perception. The breach having long since appeared in the divine analogy, an effort was being made to hold together its two terms by an affective at- traction. William Lisle Bowles, for example, felt a bond be- and moral properties of the river, and thereby made the river an " Example strong to wayward man," an "emblem" of a way of life. By this means be was first able (in his words) to consider it with " external sense " and then " with a moral eye. See also John Moir, Gleanings (London, 1785), 1I. 121-4: e.g., "Every little fly, and every little pebble, and every little flower, are tutors in the great school of nature to instruct the mind and better the heart. The four elements are the four volumes in which all her works are written." The tradition of the divine analogy continues, but at a very minor level, well into the nineteenth century. See, e. g., Charles Bucke, The Philosophy of Nature (London, 1813), I. 164 ff.: there is an analogy between external appearances of nature, and particularly affections of the soul, strikingly exesiplificalive of that general harmony, which subsists in all the universe." 92 William Jones, Works, IV. Q39.</page><page sequence="38">76 NATURE MORALIZED tween the colorful blush of sunset out of which is born the darkness of evening, and " Hope's fair gleams " that " perish as they smile." 93 The bond is due, not to a similarity in the nature of evening and hope, but to an emotional chain that Heads Bowles from sunset, to the thought of the friendless, to the lament on hope. The emotional sense of loneliness is far more important in establishing the analogy than is any thought of a real relation between image and idea. When Coleridge was under the influence of Bowles, he wrote that the most exquisite sonnets are those " in which moral Sentiments, Affections, or Feelings, are deduced from, and associated with, the Scenery of Nature " because they " create a sweet and indissoluble union between the intellectual and the material world." 14 That the union is to be created by the mind instead of found, reveals how completely the divine analogy had broken down. The Roman- tics, taking their clue from the new psychology, but dissatis- fied with mere associationism, now set out to find a more com- plex and closely integrated relationship of the shows of things and the desires of the mind.
