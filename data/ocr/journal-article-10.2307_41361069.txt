<plain_text><page sequence="1">The following lecture wras then delivered : - MYSTICISM AND ETHICS IN HINDU THOUGHT By Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, M.A., D.Litt. I I am honoured by the invitation of the Royal Society of Arts to give the annual lecture associated with the name of Sir George Birdwood. Though the British have been in India for many decades and Christian missionaries from this country are to be found there in large numbers, Indian culture occupies less space in ' their thoughts and studies than in those of some other countries of the West. The ordinary Britisher is interested in law and order, in political and economic relations, and is indifferent to the life and thought which alone can bind peoples together. He thinks that he has comprehended India because he has conquered it. Sir George Birdwood with his keen sense of inquietude for Indian culture and his imaginative understanding is an exception to the general rule. If those two great sections of humanity, Great Britain which represents the best of Europe and India which is the ultimate East, with their distinctive temperaments and traditions, can live together in a political system whose keynote is equality and friendship and not dominion or subjection, it will be the greatest achievement of history. An appreciation of cultural values and psychological differences is essential if the present connection between the two countries is not to end in a tragedy of cross purposes. We have a proper approach to the Indian problem in the writings of Sir George Birdwood, who realised that religion represents the essential motive of Indian life. The place of religion in the life of mankind has of late become the subject of keen and anxious discussion among the thoughtful. The hurry and distraction of our life are obvious ; the deep faith in the reality of eternal values and the earnest endeavour to live, individually and socially, in the light of that faith escape notice. The indifference to organised religions which is the cause of much heartsearching to established churches is the product not so much of growing secularism as of deepening spirituality. The conviction is widespread and deep-rooted that truth must be sought even though it may result in unpleasant conclusions. Scrupulous sensitiveness in our search for truth is making it difficult for us to accept doubtful authority or half-heard traditions. If genuine religious belief</page><page sequence="2">7S8 journal of the royal society of arts July 2, 1937 has become for many a phenomenon of the past, a past which has no part in the present, it is because religions confound eternal truth with temporal facts, metaphysics with history. They have become largely a traffic with the past. For example, in Christendom theology is busy with such questions as : Are the Scriptures inspired ? How shall we explain the divergencies in the accounts of the life of Christ ? How shall we reconcile the Biblical account of creation with modern science ? Were the Old Testament prophecies fulfilled ? Shall we believe in the New Testament miracles ? Acute thinkers spend their time and energies in finding modern ideas in ancient texts or reading meanings into them which are not there. Those who care more for truth than for comfort are drifting away from orthodox creeds. Besides, the anthropomorphic conceptions which look upon God as king or conqueror, father or lawgiver, the good shepherd or the righteous judge possessing to a transcendent degree the qualities of power and virtue which we most admire in human beings, seem to us somewhat archaic and crude. They tend to hide the central truth that God is Spirit and that the only real worship is that which is in spirit and truth. A crude anthropomorphism takes us to absurd lengths. When the Titanic was going down, it is said that an American millionaire retired to his cabin, not to say his prayers but to put on his dinner clothes. When asked he explained that he wished to go before his Maker looking like a gentleman. Again, religion as a way of life is the seeking of the eternal. It is not an intellectual acceptance of a remote deity, or a mere emotion or habit. Many of those who affirm belief in God or in future life act as if neither existed. There is a great difference between what we think we believe, and what we really believe. Religion must be founded on veritable truth. It begins for us with an awareness that our life is not of ourselves alone. There is another greater life enfolding and sustaining us. Man's search for this greater self is the essence of religion. Such a religion will not accept any creeds as final or any laws as perfect. It will itself be evolutionary, moving ever onward. The witness to this spiritual view is borne, not only by the great religious teachers and leaders of mankind, but by the ordinary man in the street. Ultimate certainties are within the soul of man. To know oneself is to know all we can know and all we need to know. When we realise that the seed of perfection nestles under each heart, we will have an increased sense of reverence and charity for mankind. A spiritual, as distinct from a religious view of life remains unaffected by the advance of science and criticism of history. Religion generally refers to something external, a system of sanctions and consolations, while spirituality points to the need for knowing and living in the highest self and raising life in all its parts. Spirituality is the core of religion, and its inward essence and mysticism emphasise this side of religion. Mysticism is a word ill-favoured by the rationalist as well as by the dogmatic theologian. It is criticised as a tendency to see things cloudily, in a golden but sentimental haze, to justify the habit of the human mind to entertain contradictory beliefs at the same time, to exalt confusion of thought. Mysticism is none of these things. It is the admission of mystery in the universe. It cannot be regarded</page><page sequence="3">July 2, 1937 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 759 as a reproach in a world which is by all rational accounts mysterious. If we were only what we seem to be to our normal self -awareness there would be no mystery ; if the world were only what it can be made out to be by the perceptions of the senses and the analysis of reason, there would be no riddle ; or at any rate the mystery would not be deep, nor the riddle difficult. In our rationalistic consciousness we are ignorant of ourselves because we know only that which changes in us from moment to moment and not that which is enduring ; we are ignorant of the world because we are aware of its appearances and not its true being. Mysticism is opposed to the naturalism which categorically denies the existence of God and the dogmatism which talks as if it knew all about Him. Both agree in abolishing all mystery in the world. In his exaltation of scientific integrity the rationalist can at times be as vehement, as dogmatic and as narrow as any of the creeds which he believes himself to have supplanted. Without a sense of awe in the presence of the unknown religion would be a petty thing. Mysticism, which lays stress on the personal experience of God, " direct contact with the creative spirit," is what Bergson calls " open religion." The " closed " religions are the credal, ritualistic ones which give a sense of security to frightened children. Only an open religion, which requires us to enter the spiritual stream where our spirit can refresh and restore itself, can save humanity, which is half crushed by the weight of its own progress. The criticism that mysticism is an effective spiritual instrument in the hands of political reaction points to its abuse. The mystic or intuitive consciousness is not to be confused with the instinctive. It is not a flight to unreason or a glorification of ignorance and obscurity. It assumes the indiv isible oneness of human life whose apprehensions cannot be contrary to reason. Pascal's well-known classification of the three ways to belief - custom, reason and inspiration - suggests the three stages of mental evolution, sense, reason and intuition, though they are not to be regarded as chronologically successive and separate. In the lowest stage of infancy the senses are most active. In youth we rise from the empirical to the dialectical stage when we argue and derive conclusions from observed data. At a more mature stage we obtain a synthetic and intuitive knowledge of reality by means of an experience which embraces the whole soul. But intuition, though it includes the testimony of will and feeling, is never fully attained without strenuous intellectual effort. It cannot dispense with the discipline of reason and the technique of proof. Religion itself may take three forms - primitive or sensuous, reflective and mystical. Religion in the mystic sense is not a mere speculation of reason or a feeling of dependence or a mode of behaviour. It is something which our entire self is, feels and does ; it is the concurrent activity of thought, feeling and will. It satisfies the logical demand for abiding certainty, the aesthetic longing for repose and the ethical desire for perfection. In the great mystics, the rishis of the Upanisads , Buddha, Samkara, and hundreds of others, holiness and learning, purity of soul and penetration of understanding were fused in a harmonious whole.</page><page sequence="4">7^0 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS July 2, 1937 II A study of the classic types of mystical experience discloses an astonishing agreement which is almost entirely independent of race, clime or age.* An ultimate inward similarity of the human spirit does not mean an absolute identity of mystical experience. There are individual variations within the large framework. In the East, for example, the mysticisms of the Upanisads , of the Bhagavadgltã of Samkara, of Rãmãnuja, of Rãmãkrishna, of Zen Buddhism, or of Jalãluddin Rümí are different one from the other. Similarly in the West, the mysticism of Plato and Paul, of Proclus and Tauler, Plotinus and Eckhart, differ from one another. The variations are not determined by race, climate or geographical situation. They appear side by side within the same circle of race or culture, developing different tendencies and traditions. Unfortunately, a tendency has grown up of late to distinguish Eastern mysticism from that of the West or, to be more precise, Hindu mysticism from the Christian by contrasting the immense ethical seriousness of the latter with the ethical indifference of the former. Christian thought, it is said, is dynamic and creative. It affirms the reality of the world and the meaningfulness of life. Hindu thought, on the other hand, is said to deny the reality of the world, despair of human life, poison the very springs of thought and activity, and exalt death and immobility. It does not create power and purpose directed to high ends. A characteristic statement of this contrast is found in Dr. Schweitzer's account of Indian thoughtf, which we shall consider for two reasons. Firstly, the author is a thinker of great influence and importance, whose writings, whatever faults we may find in them, are nevertheless entitled to our respect and gratitude. Secondly, his account brings together in a convenient form the chief criticisms urged against Hindu thought. His argument is based mainly on the antagonism of the two attitudes which he calls " world and life affirmation " and " world and life negation." The former accepts the reality and value of world and life, while the latter denies any real existence to the world and the life in it, which are said to be meaningless and sorrowful. In this scheme the individual is required to " bring life to a standstill in himself by mortifying his will to live and by renouncing all activity which aims at improvement of the conditions of life in this world." J World and life affirmation results in social service, whilst the other takes no interest in a world which it dismisses as a stage play or at best a puzzling pilgrimage through time to eternity. The latter view is bound to make compromises, since " ethical world and life negation is in itself a contradictory and non-realisable * Cf. Dean Inge: "Mysticism is singularly uniform in all times and places. The communion of the soul with God has found much the same expression whether the mystic is a Neo-platonic philosopher like Plotinus, a Mohammadan Sufi, a Catholic monk or a Quaker. Mysticism which is the living heart of religion, springs from a deeper level than the differences which divide the Churches, the cultural changes which divide the ages of history," Freedom , Love and Truth (1936), pages 25-26. y Indian Thought and tts Development.

For ethics comprise world and life affirmation."* The instinctive will to live is in us and it operates in the direction of world affirmation. This type of criticism and contrast has been so pervasive and persistent that there is no little danger of its being accepted without much examination as an incontrovertible truth. Large historic movements cannot be forced into exaggerated symmetry. Nature refuses to be regulated according to our prescrip- tion. If we start with the idea of fitting history into neat patterns, we shall find it difficult to resist the temptation of overlooking essential facts or twisting them out of shape. Dr. Schweitzer defines world and life affirmation and world and life negation as antitheses or alternatives which exclude each other, whereas they are only phases of a single whole which are emphasised more or less. He is compelled by the evidence of facts to admit the existence in Hindu thought of aspects which are of a world affirming character and in Christian thought of aspects of a world negating character. On account of his starting point he is obliged to regard them as inconsistencies. There are certain central features in Hindu thought, such as the four stages of life (1 ãsramas ), the second of which is that of the householder, the doctrines of Karma and rebirth, which imply action in a real world. In the earliest Hindu thought as found in the Rg Veda and the Upanisads , these characteristic views are set forth, and Dr. Schweitzer can only say that " Brahmanism has the courage to be inconsistent." f Again, Buddhist ethics with their pity for suffering and sympathy for every form of sentient life are incompatible with world negation. Buddha's thinking was as clear arid objective as his feeling was warm and tender. He would spend hours alone in the forest " causing," as he said, 4 4 the power of benevolence which fills my mind to extend over one quarter of the world, in the same way over the second quarter, over the third, over the fourth, above, below, across, on all sides, in all directions. Over the entire universe I send forth the power of benevolence which fills my spirit ; the wide, the great, the immeasurable feeling which knows naught of hate, which doeth no evil." Buddha insists on an active and systematic cultivation of the spirit of goodwill for all kinds and conditions of men, and even for animals and all other sentient creatures. This whole exalted conception of compassion not only for mankind but for all living things does not trouble Dr. Schweitzer, who observes " the commandment not to kill, not to harm, does not arise . . . from a feeling of compassion but from the idea of keeping undefiled from the world. It belongs originally to the ethic of becoming more perfect, not to the ethic of action." It is difficult to know why we should regard perfection and action as incompatible. We find in the epics of the Rãmãyana and the Mahãbhãrata stress laid on the joy of life and the dignity of man, an eager desire for personal pre-eminence and love of adventure. The Bhagavadgltã exalts the idea of action as the way to God, but Dr. Schweitzer reminds us that such action was to be empty of all motive. It is essentially a form of inactivity. We are not told, however, when action is really action. If Rãmãnuja * Page in. t Page 38.</page><page sequence="6">762 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS July 2, 1937 and the long line of theisis who came after him affirm the reality of the world and the efficacy of action, they are to be treated as a departure from the main tradition. If Gandhi and Tagore to-day adopt an ethical view of life, it is certainly to be traced to their contact with the Christian West. The whole development of Indian thought is described as a gradual weaning from " world and life negation " to the mere rational " world and life affirmation." It is not easy to argue that Christian thought insists on the reality of the world, the value of life and the necessity for social service. As a historical critic of Christianity, Dr. Schweitzer took the same view as Johannes Weiss, Loisy and Baron von Hugel - that Jesus predicted his own coming in power within a very short time, a prediction with which the event failed to correspond. The eschatological teaching of Jesus that the end of the world was at hand reveals an attitude of world and life negation in so far as he did not assume that the Kingdom of God would be realised in this natural world, but expected its sudden and startling inauguration by supernatural power. In the Gospels we find that even while Jesus was living the vision of his disciples is fixed upon the future in a second coming of the master. In the Epistles this thought of the second coming " within the lifetime of those now living " became an obsession and proved disastrous to normal life. The Christians give away their property because they will have no use for it " in the day of the Lord." They no longer marry or give in marriage since it is foolish to establish households and conceive children when the end of all things is at hand. As the hope of the second coming began to fade, another hope, more remote but not less certain - that of meeting Christ beyond the grave - took its place. By the third century the great body of Christians were living for this future life. Four centuries after the death of Christ, Augustine saw the capture and destruction of Rome and wrote his City of God, in which he comforted himself and the people of the Empire with the thought that the destruction of our earthly cities was a matter of no importance since there was a spiritual city of God triumphant here and in the world to come, which was destined to endure for ever. Through the centuries the preparation for the life that is to come, the heaven or hell that is to follow after death, has been the keynote of Christian doctrine and discipline. The typical Christian attitude in this matter is beautifully set forth in Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress . In this text-book of Christian faith, the hero of the story, significantly named Christian, discovers that he is living in a city which is doomed to imminent destruction. Filled with alarm, he wonders what he shall do and encounters a man named Evangelist who counsels him to fly. Immediately Christian begins to run away. His wife and children, frightened at his precipitate departure, " began to cry after him to return," but Christian " put his fingers in his ears, and ran on crying ' Life ! Life ! Eternal Life ! His friends and neighbours tried to stop him, but Christian would not so much as even pause for a moment to tell them the doom that was upon the city and bid them to fly as well. He was thinking only of himself, of his own salvation. So far as the city was concerned, it might disappear together with his wife and</page><page sequence="7">July 2, 1937 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 763 children and all his friends and neighbours, but there was no need to worry if only he were saved. The complaint of the social idealist against the Christian religion is that it is essentially a doctrine of world negation, that it has tolerated and even justified the present suffering and unhappiness of people by preaching to them a future expectation of spiritual happiness. Millions of human beings in whose hearts a real faith for the service of humanity burns are turning away from it on account of its ascetic tradition. The Communists declare that they adopt the religion of the love of one's neighbour in a more thorough-going way than Christianity ever did. It is not easy to make out that Christianity's principal concern is with world and life affirmation and that world and life negation is merely an accidental or peripheral error. When confronted with historical evidence of the world-negating character of Christianity, Dr. Schweitzer contends that the Christian form of negation denies not the world as such, but only the imperfect world in expectation of the perfect world yet to come. It is not easy to establish this view. St. John tells us " The whole world lieth in wickedness." Christian theology takes the account of the Fall in the third chapter of Genesis and the Platonic theory as literal facts and exaggerates man's alienation from God and the depravity of human nature. As a consequence of Adam's disobedience, it is impossible for sinful man to fulfil the moral law by his own effort and attain salvation. For St. Paul " flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God."* Man can be saved only by God's grace. About the year 400 A.D. Pelagius dared to assert that man is created good and is free to fulfil God's commandments, the implication being that the grace of God is an aid and not a necessity for man's salvation. Augustine, when he shook himself free from the influence of Plotinus, held against Pelagius that man is inherently evil and helpless and that only the grace of God can save him. He looked upon life not merely as imperfect but as utterly corrupt. Man's salvation is a miracle of divine grace. Even the faith by which the individual is inclined to accept the proffered prevenient grace is divinely bestowed on him. The complete depravity of man gives the opportunity for the divine plan of salvation through Christ. The Church decided that Augustine was right and Pelagius wrong. Luther accepts this view and it persists in Calvin and Knox. The movement of Jansenism in the Roman Catholic Church and the mystical intensity of seventeenth century quietism are expressions of the same type of thought. The utter inability of man to do anything for himself, to discover God, promote his own salvation, or be an organ of spiritual values, has received new emphasis in the Crisis Theology of Karl Barth and his followers. For them the nature of God is for ever unrevealable in terms of human life and thought, a view diametrically opposed to the thought " The spirit of man is a candle of the Lord."')* The whole point may be put in another way. For the orthodox Christian, the coming of the Kingdom is catastrophic and not the peaceful outcome of an ever-widening process of * See Romans IX, 15-21. t Proverbs XX, 27.</page><page sequence="8">764 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS July 2, I937 evolution ; it is an intervention of God cutting right into history and not springing from it. He despairs of earth and lives in apocalyptic hopes of divine intervention. All immense simplifications of the complicated patterns of reality are misleading. To divide peoples into those who will not accept the world at all and those who will accept nothing else is hardly fair. The many reservations which Dr. Schweitzer is obliged to make in applying his scheme of world affirmation and world negation as opposite categories, of which one or the other must be denied, show that it is not adequate to the facts. A very different view is expressed by Sir George Birdwood when he says, " European Christianity, unfortunately, through the accident of the impatience of some of its early converts at the military discipline of Rome, was at its beginning placed in opposition to the general philosophical, literary, artistic and scientific culture of the Gentile world, and consequently in more or less marked antagonism to the modern secular life of the West. Happily in India . . . the Brahmanical religious life has never sundered itself from the daily working life of the laity, but is a component part of it and indissolubly bound up with it." He concludes his chief work, Sva , with the hope that " India may yet be destined to prepare the way for the reconciliation of Christianity with the world, and through the practical identification of the spiritual with the temporal life, to hasten the period of that third step forward in the moral development of humanity, when there will be no divisions of race, or creed, or class or nationality between men, by whatsoever name they may be called, since they will all be one in the acknowledgment of their common brotherhood, with the same reality and sense of consequent responsibility, with which two thousand years ago they recognised the Fatherhood of God, and again, two thousand years before that an exceptionally endowed tribe of Semites, in the very heart of Anterior Asia, formulated for all men, and for all time, the inspiring and elevating doctrine of his unity."* In other words, Sir George Birdwood believes that while the Hebrews gave the world the conception of the unity of Godhead and the Christians that of the Fatherhood of God, the Hindus will help to make these truths effective in life and thus to achieve the brotherhood of man. While Dr. Schweitzer, whose knowledge of India is based on books, holds that Hinduism makes us fugitives from life, Birdwood, who spent a lifetime among the Indians, hopes that Hinduism will yet reconcile the truths of Judaism and Christianity with world and life. The contrast to my mind is not so much between Hinduism and Christianity as between religion and a self-sufficient humanism. While religion is taken more seriously in the East, humanism is the predominant feature of Western life. Hindu religion, like all true religion, is essentially " otherworldly." It pictures this world as a mere vestibule and training ground for another in which alone life is real, rich and abiding; yet it moves men to the most impressive and sustained demonstrations of human courage, power and persistence and has built for itself a secular vesture. Its adherents describe themselves as strangers and pilgrims on * Sva (1915). pages 354~6.</page><page sequence="9">July 2, 1937 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 765 earth. Its most illustrious representatives are saints and martyrs. Matthew Arnold draws the contrast between the Eastern and the Western points of view in his well-known lines. He gives us first the impact of Europe drunk with power in Asia : The East bowed low before the blast In patient deep disdain, She let the legions thunder past And plunged in thought again. A Europe grown weary of humanism and secular development heeded the voice of the East, when she accepted Christianity : She heard it, the Victorious West, In sword and crown arrayed, She felt the void that mined her breast, She shivered and obeyed. Religion and humanism do not exclude each other. If we wrongly identify religion with world and life negation, and ethics with humanism and social progress, the two become quite different and require to be pursued on their own separate lines and in obedience to their own separate principles. They are, on the other hand, organic to each other. While the chief value of religion lies in its power to raise and enlarge the internal man, its soundness is not complete until it has shaped properly his external existence. For this we require a sound political, economic and social life, a power and an efficiency which will not only make a people survive but grow towards a collective perfection. If a religion does not secure these ends, there is a defect somewhere, either in its essential principles or in their application. A spiritual view is sustained not only by insight but by a rational philosophy and sound social institutions. Ill Let us now consider the chief arguments which Dr. Schweitzer advances in support of his thesis. 1. The emphasis on ecstasy in Hindu thought naturally tends to world and life negation. 2. Hindu thought is essentially otherwordly, and humanist ethics and otherworldliness are incompatible with each other. 3. The Hindu doctrine of mãyã which declares that life is an illusion contains the flaw of world and life negation, and in consequence Hindu thought is non-ethical. 4. The best that the Hindu has to say about the origin of the world is that it is a game played by God. 5. The way to salvation is jnãna or self-discovery. This is different from moral development, and so Hindu religion is non-ethical. 6. The goal of human endeavour is escape, not reconciliation. It is the deliverance of the soul from the bonds of finitude, not the conversion of the finite into the organ and manifestation of the infinite. Religion is a refuge from life and its problems and man has no hope of better things to come. 7. The ideal man of the Hindu religion is raised above the ethical distinctions of good and evil. 8. The ethics of inner perfection insisted on by Hindu thought conflict with an active ethic and widehearted love of one's neighbour.</page><page sequence="10">766 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS July 2, 1937 IV " The real belief of the Brahmins," says Dr. Schweitzer, " is that mail does not attain to union with Brahman by means of any achievement of his natural power of gaining knowledge, but solely by quitting the world of the senses in a state of ecstasy and thus learning the reality of pure being."* The suggestion here is that Christian mysticism represents the enrichment of personality, the heightened expression of spiritual life and Hindu mysticism requires one to run away from oneself. This is another example of over-simplification. As a reading of Hindu mysticism it is far from correct. For the Hindu, the spiritual is the basic element of human nature. Spiritual realisation is not a miraculous solution of life's problems but a slow deposit of life's fulness, a fruit which grows on the tree of life when it is mature. A strenuous discipline of concentration, meditation and contemplation is insisted on. We start by concentrating or focussing all our inward energy on a spiritual object or aspiration, checking our wayward impulses and warring thoughts. We then meditate profoundly on it until we reach the state of con- templation where consciousness is no longer differentiated into subject and object. The soul, in that state, enters the stream of life, is borne along in the flowing current of it and finds its reality in the larger enveloping life. This life of spirit, where freedom from the sense of bodily or even mental limitations and emergence into a space of unlimited and infinite life is felt, is not the same as magical mysticism. What Dr. Schweitzer regards as the supernatural or the magical is the supremely normal. It is true, however, that there is a certain temperament which predisposes its subject to ecstasy. This is not surprising in view of the obvious fact that something of the same kind is true of poets and philosophers, painters and musicians. If we do not say that the genius of the artist is due to mental degeneration or nervous instability, why should religious geniuses be treated differently ? When the personality of the mystic rises to a level which is disconcerting to our normal self-centred lives, certain disorders may well show themselves. A sense of rapture is a frequent accompaniment of mystic states, but it by no means implies a disintegration of the self. To be rapt is not only to pass beyond self but to be intensely self, not only to lose self-consciousness but to be greatly conscious. Man is never torn out of the ordinary setting of his earthly life. He still has a body and mind, though he knows them to be instruments of his higher life. The true mystics possess a radiant and unified activity. They are neither excitable nor lacking in will power. While mystic experience has something in common with the delight of the artist or the ecstasy of love, which exceed all law and restriction and indicate the possibility of a real communion with life, it is not a mere glow of feeling. Excited emotionalism which seeks and strives after sensations and rapturous states of a sensual character is quite different from perfect insight (samy ag-dar sána). The contemplative saints assign a subordinate position to * page 38.</page><page sequence="11">July 2, 1937 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 767 images and other sensible presentations. These, are symbols which we use to understand, and the symbol is different from experience or understanding. Jnãna or vidyã is cool, clear-sighted vision. It is not a sudden illumination, which may well be the starting point of a mystic life. In ecstasy the soul feels itself, or thinks it feels itself, in the presence of God, being irradiated by the light ; but we must go beyond it to a stage where the consciousness of being at unity with the divine becomes constant. To have an ecstasy is perhaps to look upon the promised land but not to set foot on its soil. After the tremendous experience of the celestial vision in Chapter XI of the Bhagavadgitã the book does not end. The illumination must be transferred into the spiritual union of man with infinite being. The ecstasy does not mean a permanent change of nature. When it dies out, the soul stands alone and feels desolate. Accustomed for a time to dazzling light, it now gropes in gloom, striving for the purity of heart and the chasity of mind essential for that spiritual life which is the gradual penetration of the human consciousness by the Absolute. Ecstasy is not the only way to spiritual life. It is often a perversion of mysticism rather than an illustration of it. It is a psychic phenomenon which requires investigation. As there is a tendency to mistake ecstasy for spiritual life, we are * warned against it. The spiritual mystics the world over regard ecstasy, visions and auditions as things to be avoided and of secondary importance. They are the anomalies of the life of mystics from which they sometimes suffer, and are the results of an imperfect adaptation to a changed inner world. That is why the Hindu systems of Yoga insist on the development of nervous health ; occult visions and apparitions, physical ecstasies and trance conditions are neither the substance nor the necessary conditions of mystic life. Ecstatic phenomena are not peculiar to Hinduism. We have a case of ecstasy in the Book of Numbers in the Balaam narrative : " seeing the vision, falling down and having his eyes opened."* St. Paul speaks of spiritual rapture independent of the senses, and was only reminded of their existence by the " sting of the flesh, f Philo, one of the most famous Jews of the first century of our era looked upon inspiration as an ecstatic event by which the divine replaced the original personality. Montanism, which prevailed in the second and third centuries was definitely ecstatic. St. Theresa and St. Catherine of Genoa, among others, suffered from visions and ecstasies. Any argument based on ecstatic phenomena will apply to all religions alike. IV Any ethical theory must be grounded in metaphysics, in a philosophical conception of the relation between human conduct and ultimate reality. A self-sufficient humanism has its own metaphysical presuppositions. It requires us to confine our attention to the immediate world of space and time, and argues * xxiv. 4. f II Corinthians xii. 7. See also Mark i. 12 ; Luke iv. т.</page><page sequence="12">768 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS July 2, I937 that moral duty consists in conforming to nature and modelling our behaviour in accordance with the principles of her working. It attempts to perfect the causes of human life by purely natural means. The subject of ethics is treated as a branch of sociology or a department of psychology. Scientific materialism and mystical nationalism are two types of humanist ethics, interpreted in a narrow sense. They look upon man as a purely natural phenomenon whose outlook is rigorously confined by space and time. They encourage a cynical subservience to nature and historical process and an acquiescence in the merely practicable. Renunciation, self-sacrifice and disinterested sendee of humanity are not stimulated by the workings of natural law. An abundance of material things will not help to make life more interesting. The rich of the world are among those who find life stale, flat and unprofitable. Simply because each of us is provided with a motor-car and a radio set, we shall not find it easy to drive into the Kingdom of Heaven. Even the social conscience that urges us to extend the benefits of a material civilisation cannot be accounted for by the principles of scientific naturalism. The material basis, while essential, is still too narrow for real living. The collective myths of Nazism, Fascism and * Communism propose to make life seem rich and significant by asking us to banish all considerations of reason and humanity and to worship the State. Man is not merely an emotional being. The Nation-State falls short of the human and the universal and constitutes a deadly menace to the growth of the universal in man, which is postulated with increasing force by the advance of science, and which the well-being of human society demands. Neither of these can satisfy the full being of man. The whole question centres round the nature of man. Is he only a body which can be fed, clothed and housed, or is he also a spirit that can aspire ? The feeling of frustration experienced even by those who are provided with all the comforts and conveniences which a material civilisation can provide indicates that man does not live by bread or emotional excitement alone. Besides, progress is not its own end. If it is the ultimate reality, it cannot ever be completed. We can draw nearer and nearer the goal but cannot reach it. Its process has neither a beginning nor an end. Senseless cycles of repetition cannot give meaning to life. It may be argued that, although the universe itself may have no purpose, items in the universe like nations and individuals may have their purposes. The rise and fall of nations, the growth ar, d crash of individuals may be quite interesting, and the universe may be viewed as an infinite succession of finite purposes. Can that be regarded as a satisfactory goal of ethics ? Does not the humanist hope to build a terrestrial paradise inhabited by a perfect race of artists and thinkers ? What is the good of telling us that though our sun, moon and stars will share in the destruction of earthly life, other suns, moons and stars will arise ? We long for a good which is never left behind and never superseded. Man's incapacity to be satisfied with what is merely relative and to remain permanently within the boundaries of the finite and empirical reality cannot be denied.</page><page sequence="13">July 2, 1937 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 769 Again, in view of the enigmatic character of the actual, is moral life possible ? There are some moralists who exhort us to do what is right, even though we may not know whether it can be realised or not. Moral enthusiasm is possible only if our motive includes the expectation of being able to contribute to the achievement of moral ideals. If we are not certain that active service of the ideals will further their actualisation, we cannot be sure of their worthwhileness. We cannot help asking ourselves whether our ideals are mere private dreams of our own or bonds created by society or even aspirations characteristic of the human species. Only a philosophy which affirms that they are rooted in the universal nature of things can give depth and fervour to moral life, and courage and confidence in moral difficulties. We need to be fortified by the conviction that the service of the ideals is what the cosmic scheme demands of us, that our loyalty or disloyalty to them is a matter of the deepest moment, not only to ourselves or to society or even to the human species, but to the nature of things. If ethical thought is profound, it will give a cosmic motive to morality. Moral consciousness must include a conviction of the reality of ideals. When man realises his essential unity with the whole of being, he expresses this unity in his life. Mysticism and ethics, otherworldliness and worldly work go together. Religion is the soul's attitude, response and adjustment in the presence of the supreme realities of the transcendent order ; ethics deal with the right adjustment of life on earth, especially in human society. Both are motived by a desire to live in the light of ideals. It we are satisfied with what exists, there is no meaning in " ought " ; if we are a species of passing phenomena, there is no meaning in religion. Religion springs from the conviction that there is another world beyond the visible and the temporal with which man has dealings, and ethics require us to act in this world with the compelling vision of another. With our minds anchored in the beyond, we are to strive to make the actual more nearly like what it ought to be. Religion alone can give assurance and wider reference to ethics, a new meaning to human life. We make moral judgments about individual lives and societies simply because man is a spiritual being, and not merely a social animal. If there is one doctrine more than another which is characteristic of Hindu thought, it is the belief that there is an interior depth to the human soul, which in its essence is uncreated and deathless and absolutely real. The spirit in man is different from the individual ego ; it is that which animates and exercises the individual - the vast background of his being in which all individuals lie. In the soul of man are two conflicting tendencies, the attraction of the infinite, which abides for ever, changeless, unqualified, and untouched by the world, and the fascination of the finite, which, like the wind-beaten surface of the waters, is never for a moment the same. Every human being is a potential spirit, and represents, as has been well said, a hope of God. The heart and centre of religion is that man truly belongs to another order, and the meaning of man's life is to be found not in this world but in more than historical reality. Man's highest aim is release from the historical succession denoted by birth and death. So long as he is lost</page><page sequence="14">770 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS July 2, 1937 in the historical process without a realisation of the super-historical goal, he is only " once-born " and is liable to sorrow. God and not the world of history is the true environment of our souls. This is the great classical tradition of spiritual wisdom. The mystery cults of Greece had for their central doctrine that man's soul is of divine origin and is akin to the spirit of God. The influence of these mystery cults on Socrates and Plato is unmistakable. When Jesus tells Nicodemus that until a man is begotten from above, he cannot see or enter the Kingdom of God,* when Paul declares that " he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption, but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap everlasting life,"f they are implying that our natural life is mortal and is invaded by sin and and death,J an&lt;^ the life of spirit is immortal. St. John in the First Epistle says : " the world passeth away and the lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever."§ We are amphibious beings, according to Plotinus. We live on earth and in a world of spirit. In his earlier Plotinian stage, Augustine said : " Our hearts, О God, are restless until they find rest in Thee." We belong to God. V Although the view about the co-existence of the human and the divine in close intimacy and inter-penetration may be true, does not Hindu thought declare that life is empty and unreal and that it has no purpose or meaning ? Dr. Schweitzer tells us that for the Upanisads " the world of the senses is a magic play staged by the universal soul for itself. The individual soul is brought into this magic play under a spell. By reflection about itself it must become capable of seeing through the deception. Thereupon it gives up taking part in the play. It waits quietly and enjoys its identity with the universal soul until, at death, the magic play for it ceases to be."** " Man cannot engage in ethical activity in a world with no meaning."ff " For any believer in the mãyã doctrine ethics can have only a quite relative importance.";]; J This account is by no means a fair representation of the position of the Upanisads . The long theistic tradition interprets the doctrine of the Upanisads in a way directly opposed to this account. Samkara upholds the doctrine of mãyã and it is doubtful whether Dr. Schweitzer's view is adequate to Samkana's thought. The whole question centres round the relation of time to eternity, of historical becoming to absolute being. Is succession, history, progress real and sufficient in its own right, or does man's deep instinct for the unchanging point to an eternal perfection which alone gives the world meaning and worth ? Is the inescapable flux all, or is there anything which abides ? Religious consciousness bears testimony to the reality of something behind the visible, a haunting beyond, which both attracts and disturbs, in the light of which the world of change is said to be unreal. The Hebrews contrasted the abidingness of God with the swift flow of human generations. * St. John iii. 5. t Galatians vi. 8. { Romans vi. 23. § I John ii. 17. ** Page 59. ff Page 60. Jf Page 165.</page><page sequence="15">July 2, 1937 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 77 1 " Before the mountains were brought forth or ever Thou hadst formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God."* The psalmist cries to his God : " They (i.e., heaven and earth) shall be changed : but Thou art the same, and Thy years shall have no end."j* The Christian exclaims : " The things which are seen are temporal ; but the things which are not seen are eternal." J The mutubility of things, which is part of the connotation of the word tnã yã&gt; is a well-known theme in the world's literature. The world is mãyã- i.e., passes away - but God is eternal. Eternity is not simply everlastingness or unendingness. Nor is it unchangingness in the sense of fixedness in frozen rigidity, which is another name for death. Change, causality, activity are finite categories and the Eternal is lifted above them. God is not a mere means to explain the universe or improve human society. The vision of God is the centre of religious life. Šamkara, who is rightly credited with the systematic formulation of the doctrine of mãyã , tells us that the highest reality is unchangeable, and therefore that changing existence such as human history has not ultimate reality (pãramãrthika sattã). He warns us, however, against the temptation to regard what is not completely real as utterly illusory. The world has empirical being ( vyãvahãrika sattã) which is quite different from illusory existence ( prãtibhãsika sattã). Human experience is neither ultimately real nor completely illusory. Simply because the world of experience is not the perfect form of reality, it does not follow that it is a delusion, without any significance. The world is not a phantom, though it is not real. Brahman is said to be the real of the real, satyasyasatyam. In all objective consciousness, we are in a sense aware of the real. Similarly all knowledge presupposes the knower, who is constant, while the known is unsteady. When Plato tells us that we bring universal ideas with us from the world in which we lived before our birth, he is referring to the non-phenomenal, time-transcending power in us which belongs to a different world from the observed phenomena. The vovs which organises the facts of experience and interprets them is not itself a fact of experience. It must have had its origin in and belong to another world. It beholds by virtue of its own nature eternal realities. This presence in us is an assurance that we are in touch with reality. Spirit is real being and the rest its limited activity. The spirit is pure existence, self-aware, tireless, spaceless, unconditioned, not dependent for its being on its sense of objects, not dependent for its delight on the gross or subtle touches of outward things. It is the one reality which, if we knew it perfectly, would give us the key to the knowledge of all things, yasmin , jnãte sarvatn víj nã tam. It is not divided in the multitude of beings. Samkara's advaita or non -duality has for its central thesis the non-difference between the individual self and Brahman. As for difference or multiplicity ( nãnãlva ), it is not real. The self-discrepant character shows that it is only an appearance of the real. All schools of Advaita are agreed * Psalm ix. il. t Psalm cii. 26 and 27. J II. Corinthians iv. т8.</page><page sequence="16">772 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS July 2, I937 on these two propositions. Differences arise when the nature of the actuality of the manifold world as distinct from the reality is described. Šamkara accepts the empirical reality of the world which is negated only when perfect insight or intuition of the oneness of all is attained. Until then it has empirical validity or pragmatic justification. There are advaitins who argue that the world of difference had not even empirical validity. Šamkara, however, tells us that so long as we are in the world of mãyã and occupy a dualistic standpoint, the world is there, standing over against us, determining our perceptions and conduct. He tells us, moreover, that the world we see and touch is not independent and self-sufficing. It carries no explanation of itself. It is a world reflecting the condition of our minds. It is a partial construction made from insufficient data under the stress of self-conscious individuality with its cravings and desires. What is perceived and shaped into meaning depends on the powers of apprehension we employ and the interests we possess. Our passion-limited apprehension gives us the world of commonsense. Take the apparent facts of the universe. Matter is not primal. It is a thing made, not self-existent. It is not a baseless fiction, but at the lowest a misrepresentation of truth, and at the highest an imperfect representation or translation of the truth into a lower plane. Mãyã is not solipsism. It does not say that suns and universes are the invention of the solitary mind. Šamkara proclaims his opposition to the Vijnãnavãda or mentalism. He argues that waking experiences are distinct from dream states, though neither can be regarded as real metaphysically. Our world of waking experience is not the ultimate reality, but neither is it a shadow show. Even as our knowledge implies the presence of a constant consciousness, the object of our knowledge implies the reality of pure being. Our conceptions of the universe answer to our degrees of consciousness. As our consciousness increases in its scope, we see more clearly. We now see partly as an animal and partly as a human being. Sometimes the world is viewed as one of self-satisfaction, at other times as an object of curiosity and contemplation. To see it in truth one has to free oneself from sense addiction and concentrate the whole energy of one's consciousness on the nature of reality. It is the only way by which we can attain a clear consciousness of reality as it is and get a true picture of the world instead of partial cosmologies. Knowledge which we now obtain through senses and reason cannot be regarded as complete or perfect. It is flawed with antinomies and contradictions. Through the force of avidyã (not knowing) we impose on the reality of the one the multiplicity of the world. This avidyã is natural (naisargika) to the human mind, and the world is organically connected with it. It is not therefore a mere waking dream. We are surrounded by something other than ourselves, which cannot be reduced to states of our own consciousness. Though the world is always changing, it has a unity and a meaning. These are revealed by the reality present all through it. This reality lies not in the facts but in the principle which makes them into a whole. The world is not anarchical. We are able to know that the world is imperfect, finite and changing, because we</page><page sequence="17">July 2, 1937 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 773 have a consciousness of the eternal and the perfect. It is by the light of this consciousness that we criticise ourselves or condemn the world. Even as the human individual is a complex of the eternal and the temporal, the world which confronts him contains both. It is as Šamkara puts it, a mixture of both truth and illusion.* It partakes of the characteristics of being and non-being ( sadasadãtmaka ). Although, therefore, it has a lower form of reality than pure spirit, it is not non- existent. While Šamkara refuses to acquiesce in the seeming reality of the actual, he does not dismiss it as an unreal phantasmagoria. It is not determinable either as real or as unreal. Its truth is in being, reality, truth (sat) ; its multiplicity and division, its dispersal in space and time is untrue (&lt; an-ritam ). In the world itself, we have change. Šamkara does not tell us that the process of the world is perpetual recurrence, in which events of past cycles are repeated in all their details. Such a view would make the world process meaningless. If everything is recurrent, perpetually rotating, and governed by a law of cyclic motion, there is nothing new, no meaning in history. Hindu thinkers accept a historical fulfilment and destiny for the cosmic process. Mankind is engaged in a pursuit that tends towards a definite goal. Truth will be victorious on earth and it is the nature of the cosmic process that the finite individual is called upon to work, through the exercise of his freedom, for that goal through ages of struggle and effort. The soul has risen from the sleep of matter, through plant and animal life, to the human level, and is battling with ignorance and imperfection to take possession of its infinite kingdom. It is absolute, not in its actual empirical condition, but in its potentiality, in its capacity to appropriate the Absolute. The historical process is not a mere external chain of events, but offers a succession of spiritual opportunities. Man has to attain a mastery over it and reveal the higher world operating in it. The world is not therefore an empty dream or an eternal delirium. VI To the question why the supreme spirit makes individual souls and the world arise from itself, Dr. Schweitzer informs us that the Hindus have no better answer than that the whole thing is just a play. " So it is impossible for them to attribute real importance to ethics. "f This brings us to the problem of the relation between the unchanging real and the changing world. Whatever the nature of the world may be, finite or infinite, it is contingent. The question remains, why does the world exist at all ? To say that it is a mystery is perhaps true, but it can hardly be called an answer. J No answer can be logically satisfactory, since the question itself is not logically framed. It involves a confusion of standpoints. We are using temporal terms with reference to an order which is * Saiyãnrte nithumïkrtya. f Page I5^- J Dr. Schweitzer himself admits that " ethical mysticism humbly leaves unanswered the question in what manner the world spirit exists within the poor human spirit and in it attains to consciousness of itseli," page 264.</page><page sequence="18">774 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS July 2, 1937 essentially non -temporal. The psalmist tells us " God is in heaven, and thou upon earth ; therefore let thy words be few."* When Augustine was asked, " What was God doing before he made heaven and earth," he answered " preparing hell for the over-curious." Time was with creation and so the question of " before " has no meaning. As to how the primal reality in which the divine light shines everlastingly can yet be the source and fount of all empirical being is a mystery, mãyã. If we still raise the question, our answers are bound to be riddled with difficulties. Why should there arise an imperfect process of becoming from a being who is perfection itself ? If we answer with Plato that God was not jealous and he wished to share his goodness with others, other difficulties arise. Is the creation different from perfection or not ? If it is not we have no creation but only repetition. If it is, in what sense is it so ? Is it good or bad ? If it is bad, then perfection has produced something imperfect. If it is good, then it is not new, for perfection by definition includes all that is good. If it is said that God is not perfect without his creation, and that creation is necessary to his full expression, then God is not perfection or absolute reality. God and the world together make up the total reality. God by himself is imperfect. A being who is perfect and eternal cannot depend on anything fragmentary and temporal. If God is bound by the necessity to create, he is dependent on the worshippers and so cannot be an object of worship. And yet there is a world of becoming which in a sense is other than God. How can God and the world both be real ? If God is always complete reality without the world, how can anything else arise ? The explanation offered by Šamkara admits that the universe is dependent on the Absolute, though not the Absolute on the universe. A distinction is made between manifestation or transformation ( parinãma ) and one-sided dependence (vivar ta). The illustrations used for explaining the latter type of dependence suggest the illusory theory of the world. The world is said to depend on the Absolute even as the appearance of a mirage depends on shining sand particles. The point of these illustrations is to affirm that the production and cessation of the appearances make no difference to the reality of which they are the reflections. In the case of transformation, the substance itself is changed. When the effect is destroyed, the cause also is destroyed. Aristotle tells us that the world depends on God though God is completely unaware of and unaffected by it. The temporal yields a real apprehension of the eternal, though it does not contain or exhaust the eternal. The eternal does not take part in the temporal process as though it were one with it. We see the eternal through the temporal, not face to face, but under a veil. Becoming is an imperfect representation of being. The doctrine of one-sided dependence is hostile to ideas of organic relationship between God and the world, which are very popular to-day. Evolution is introduced into the life of God. For William James God " may draw vital * Psalm cii. 25-27.</page><page sequence="19">July 2, 1937 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 775 strength and increase of very being from our fidelity."* Bergson's life force and Alexander's emergent deity are finite self-educating gods. For Nicholas Berdyaek ihe process of history belongs to the inmost depths of the divine. f For him, God is susceptible of change and even suffering. Hindu thought is emphatic in asserting that the changes of the world do not affect the integrity or perfection of the Absolute. Evolution and novelty do certainly exist, but they belong solely to the cosmic side of the picture, and their function is to reveal the immutable presence of an Absolute to which they add nothing. Advaita Vedãnta proclaims that this cosmos is not the final end of the Absolute, which is independent of creation. When we look at the Absolute from the cosmic end, not as it is in itself,. but as it is in relation to the world, the Absoluce is envisaged as Isvara - a personal God who guides and directs the process by his providence. In the Upanisads the Absolute is said to have nothing of empiric being about it. It is perfection itself, though personality is attributed to it. Samkara explains that there are two different doctrines in the Upanisads , one representing the esoteric truth that Brahman is the impersonal, unknowable Absolute without attributes, the other that Brahman is the God who manifests himself in the universe. The Upanisads believed that there was only one doctrine. Theistic philosophy conceives Brahman everywhere as a personal God. Samkara makes out that impersonal Brahman becomes personal Isvara through combining with the limitation of wisdom. J He is all-knowing, the lord of all selves, the principle of objectivity ( mulaprakrti ), and at the same time the inner guide of all things and souls. The analogy of play (/z7ď)§ is employed to suggest the free overflow of the divine into the universe. It does not mean that there is nothing real or great going on all the time. The world is the profoundest expression of the divine nature, devasya esa svabhãvah , as Gãndapãda puts it. The analogy is not incended to suggest that the universe is a meaningless show made in a jest.** Life is the apparatus for the unfolding of the spirit. VII Dr. Schweitzer declares : " If the reality of the world is denied, then ethics altogether cease to have any importance. The only thing that remains for man to do is to see through the delusion of believing in a material world." ff Again, " For any believer in the mãyã doctrine ethics can have only a quite relative importance." J J The second statement is somewhat different from the first, since * The Will to believe and other Essays. t The Meaning of History E.T. 19З6. pages 45~46- t Commentary on Aitareya Upanisad v.3. § Krïdârlham srjati prabhuh. ** The Koran asks " Thinkest thou that I have made the heavens and the earth and all that is between in a jest ? " -j-j* Page 60. XX Page 65.</page><page sequence="20">yj6 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS July 2, I937 it affirms the compatibility of ethics with the mãyã doctrine though the first denies it altogether. While this doctrine suggests that the world may not be worthy of being lived in, it holds that life in it is worth living if it is directed by spiritual ideals. Enthusiastic service of humanity is possible only if we have faith in a transcendent goal. Mere morality without spiritual conviction or jnãna is incapable of giving us satisfaction. Jnãna (or seeing through the veil of mãyã) is the spiritual destiny of man. It is something more than ethical goodness. It is all the difference between perfection and progress, between eternal life and temporal development, between time suspended and time extended. One is an improvement of human nature while the other is a re-orientation of it. We cannot reach perfection by means of progress any more than we can reach the point where the clouds touch the horizon by running. We can become perfect only by overcoming selfishness. The moral man battles with selfishness, but works all the time under the illusion of egoism. The saint " covers himself with the truth of the universal self." If we take our stand on unreality we may grow better or worse, but not perfect. The view which regards the multiplicity as ultimate is deceptive (mãyã) for it causes the desire to live separate and independent lives. When we are under the influence of mãyã , we think we are completely separate entities, sharing little and mistaking individuality, which is one of the conditions of our life in space- time, for isolation and not wishing to lose the hard outlines of our separate existence. Mãyã keeps us busy with the world of succession and finitude. It causes a certain restlessness in our souls, a fever in our blood. It tempts us to accept as real bubbles which will be broken, cobwebs which will be swept away. This wearing of masks, this playing of roles, this marionette performance of ourselves is mistaken for truth. This fascination of the trifling, this preoccupation with the transitory blinds us to the real. We forget that we are more closely allied in spirit than we suspect, that we share infinitely more than we can realise. If this life were all, if our brief little existence on the little lighted stage were the grand reality, if there were no invisible sphere, no great communion of minds, no shared adventures of spirit, we would not have the feeling of moving through a haunted world. Compared with those who have seen the truth of things, the awakened spirits, we are sleep-walkers. There is a saying of Goethe that error stands in the same relation to truth as sleep to waking. The Bhagavadgltã tells us that " the wise one is awake when it is night for all others and he looks upon that as night in which other living beings are awake."* The genuineness of one's awakening is directly proportionate to one's apprehension of truth. Wisdom liberates while ignorance binds, and the inner change is essential to perfection. This self-finding or becoming one with the infinite, Dr. Schweitzer complains, * Yã ni sa s arvabìi ûtân ãm tasyam jagarti samyamï/yasyâm jãgrati bhutãni sànisa pasyato munch. II. 69.</page><page sequence="21">July 2, 1937 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 777 is " a pure act of the spirit which has nothing to do with ethics."* Progress is represented as a growing out of ignorance into knowledge. This knowledge is not merely intellectual any more than ignorance is error. Ignorance (&lt; avidyã ) and selfish desire (kãma) are two phases of one phenomenon. The ego is the knot of our continued status in ignorance, and so long as we live in the ego, we do not share in the delight of the universal spirit. In order to know the truth we must cease to identify ourselves with the separate ego shut up in the walls of body, life and mind. This overcoming of selfishness is an ethical process and is essential for enlightenment. Truth can never be perceived except by those who are in love with goodness. Again, the penetration of the illusion is not achieved by means of abstract knowledge. Intellectual progress helps us to clear the mental atmosphere of chimeras and phantoms, of errors and illusions. When these hindrances are removed, the truth of spirit is revealed, self-supported and absolutely indubitably filling our entire horizon. An inward change alone fits souls for eternal life. Besides, our apprehension of reality is by no means final, until it is total. It must embrace the whole of our nature, thought, feeling and will. Wherever the apprehension is only partial, in thought or feeling or will, there will be discontent and unrest in the midst of repose. The individual strives to make God-control entire by throwing off all that is impure and selfish. All this means effort. Wisdom is not cheaply won. It is achieved through hard sacrifice and discipline, through the endurance of conflict and pain. It is intent living, the most fruitful act of man by which he tries to get at reality behind the restless stream of nature and his own feelings and desires. The destiny of the human soul is to realise its oneness with the supreme. In every soul, even in that of the greatest sinner, the divine dwells. This indwelling of the divine is an enduring fact. There is a difference between the substantial immanence and the conscious union which requires of the creature self-willed identification. If the substantial reality of the human soul abides in that quality which we call spirit, growth of spiritual life means conscious realisation of the fundamental truth. VIII In another way Hindu thought is said to be non-ethical. Systematic ethical reflection cannot be found in it for the obvious reason that the supreme end is release from the constitutive conditions of actuality. " Deliverance from reincarnation can only be attained through freedom from the world and freedom from the will to live."f Samkara tells us that the end of all discipine is to secure the full riddance of the causes which make for rebirth. J The question relates to the " constitutive condition of actuality." So long as the illusion of separate ego persists, existence in the temporal process is inevitable. Negatively, release ~~~ * Page 43. t Pa£e 42* J Sahetukasya samsãrasya atyantop anana.</page><page sequence="22">778 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS July 2, 1937 is freedom from hampering egoism ; positively, it is realisation of the spiritual destiny. The abandonment of the ego is an identification with a fuller life and consciousness. The soul is raised to a sense of its universality. It leaves behind existence for itself alone, and becomes united with the spirit of the universe. No longer has it any private wishes of its own. In Gethsemane, Christ as an individual felt that the cup should pass away. That was his personal desire. The secret of the cross is the crucifixion of the ego and our yielding to the will of God. " Thy will be done." Every man by merging his will in the will of God, by losing his self in submission to God, finds the truth of his own self. The burden of experience is laid upon us in order to purify us from egoism. Eternal life is one in which the universal spirit is all in all. The jnãni or the seer is aglow with God. He becomes an instrument of the universal self. He does not abstain from the work of the world, but does it with his eyes fixed on the eternal. Religion is not a flight from the world, a taking refuge in the ordered serenity of heaven, in despair over the hopeless disorder of earth. Man belongs to both orders and his religion is here or nowhere. Life eternal is not some place yonder. It is here and now, and consists in another kind of life in the midst of time. Religious life is a rhythm, with moments of contemplation, of action, of refreshment and restoration in the life of spirit, and of action with a sense of mission in the world. The man of wisdom is interested in promoting the welfare of all created beings, according to the Bhagavadgltã (sarvabhutahiteratah). Holiness is known by the happiness it sheds. The test of authentic spiritual insight is an increased integration of the person's life, quickened sensibility, heightened power and universal tenderness. The fusing of the finite and the infinite, of the surface consciousness and the ultimate depths, gives the sense of a new creation. To live consciously in the finite alone is to live in bondage, with ignorance and egoism, suffering and death. By drawing back from an ignorant absorption, we recover our spiritual being and dwell within, unaffected by the limitations of mind, life and body, so that the finite in which we outwardly live becomes a conscious representation of the divine being. Thus do we escape from our apparent bondage into our real freedom. Mysticism has its extremists who look upon the real as spiritual freedom, and contrast it with the actual in its bondage, declaring that birth is an error of the soul and that our chance of liberation lies in shaking off these shackles and a violent reversion to supracosmic consciousness or the freedom of abstract being. The theory of mãyã has been interpreted in this negative sense so as to lend support to the theory that man's life has no real meaning, that it is a mistake of the soul, an error that has inexplicably crept into being. Since the real is the supreme Brahman, the only thing to do is to get away from all being, celestial or terrestrial. The illusion is real to itself and it binds us so long as we rest in it. Our true aim should be to get rid of the error and thus of life. Moksa or release is the extinction of the individual, his annulment in the absolute. Since the world is an illusion, it is a waste of energy to spend labour and heroism in battling with its merely</page><page sequence="23">July 2, 1937 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 779 illusory events. Our duty consists in putting up uncomplainingly with its annoying semblance of reality. By adopting an ethic of quietism and resignation, we are enabled to enter in some measure into the peaceful being of the absolute which knows nothing of errors and illusions and is tirelessly at rest. If this view is accepted, the path of the universe is an aimless one. The world of history and the wheel of rebirth are parts of a mechanism of self-deception. The will not to live is the highest good, the one desirable result of all living. Such exaggerations are to be met with in mysticism in Eastern as well as Western thought, but Šamkara has nothing in common with people who will not accept the visible world, any more than with those who will accept nothing else. Exclusive absorption in a super-historical goal often produces the feeling that all things temporal are so fragile and fleeting that they are hardly worth our serious attention. But the eternal is not out of all relation to the world of history. Though caught in the finite, we aspire for the infinite. The long series of births and rebirths, though in one sense a chain of bondage, is in another sense a means to self-knowledge. To develop out of a materialised being into a spiritualised being is the crown of human evolution. It is to live in the immortality of spirit though attached to a mortal body. What we aspire to is not to develop into something utterly different from what we are ; it consists in a self-finding, a self-becoming. We have to outgrow much, and exceed many of our self-limitations, in order to attain this, but the transfiguration to which we aspire is the very law of our nature. Ignorance and obscuration of self-knowledge conceal this fact from us. The liberated individual works for the welfare of the world. The Bhagavadgïtâ tells us that " Man does not attain to the state of being without work by undertaking no work, nor does he reach perfection by simply shunning the world." It is improper for man to remain without sharing in the work of the world, even when God consents to work for the universe. Besides, so long as man lives, he cannot remain even for an instant without activity.* Love to God expresses itself in love to creation.f The sage is not egocentric in the sense of caring for his own soul, nor altruistic in the sense of caring for others, nor theocentric in the sense of wishing to enjoy God in the solitude of his soul. He is at the heart of the universe in which he himself and others live, move and have their being. He is conscious of the wider destiny of the universe. The question is not, what shall I do to be saved, but in what spirit shall I do ? Detachment of spirit and not renunciation of the world is what is demanded from us. Spiritual freedom is not inconsistent with action. The knowers of Brahman remake the world, according to the Brhadãnanyaka Up(inisad.' Action done in a disinterested spirit does not bind or sully the soul ( na Harma lipyate nare). This cosmic process from the world soul to the lowest objects is a phenomenon, a historical series, § which, when it reaches its end, disappears into the Absolute. Until this consummation is attained, ♦III. 8. txn- Ï3-4. Î111- 5- § Šamkara on Brhadananyaka Upanisad I. 1.

Religion has no secret which absolves us from living. Dr. Schweitzer forgets that the great text " That art Thou " ( tat tvam asi) is bound up with an ethic of active service. He writes, " Easy as it would be to turn the doctrine of tat tvam asi in an ethical direction, they nevertheless neglect to do it."* At the end of his Indian tour, Dr. Paul Deussen said to a gathering in Bombay, " The Gospels quite correctly establish as the highest law of morality, Love your neighbour as yourself." But why should I do so, since by the order of nature I feel pain and pleasure only in myself, not in my neighbour ? The answer is not in the Bible . . . but it is in the Veda, in the great formula, " That art Thou," which gives in three words the combined sum of metaphysics and morals. You shall love your neighbour as yourselves because you are your neighbour. In the words of the Bhagavadgïtâ , " He who knows himself in everything and everything in himself will not injure himself by himself." Every person round me is myself at a different point of space and time and at a different grade of being. When one realises that all beings are but the self (&lt; ãtmaivãbhut ), one acts not selfishly but for all beings. IX Dr. Schweitzer thinks that Brahmanic mysticism has nothing to do with ethics. It is through and through supra-ethical.f When the individual soul is liberated from egoism and attains spiritual freedom, it is spontaneously united with the universal will. It acts in an impersonal way without effort or expectation. It has become a passive instrument of the divine, itself without initiative, savrãrambhaparityãgi . Ordinarily action distracts us from our true self. Man, in affirming himself by his actions, thinks himself to be the agent. Such action tends to be an escape from the deeper reality of our own nature. As we have seen, the action of the seer is of a different kind. It is creative living where external authority gives place to inward freedom, and the little footrules made to measure morality lose their point. Only in this sense do the Upanisads declare that the immortal man overcomes both the thoughts " I did evil " and " I did good." Good and evil, done or not done, cause him no pain. J " Give up good and evil, truth as well as untruth. Having given up truth and untruth, give up the consciousness that you have given them up."§ Even self-consciousness is an obstacle. We reach an impersonal stage when the individual is lost in the universal spirit. The liberated individual is lifted beyond the ethical distinctions of good and evil. When the Upanisad says that " sin does not cling to a wise man any more than water clings to a lotus leaf," it does not mean that the sage may sin and yet be free, but rather that any one who is free from wordly attachments is also free from all temptation to sin. His living is invulnerable. So long as a man is a * Page 43. f Page 43. J Brhadãvavyalea Up.

" He will become pure by good acts and impure by evil acts. Whatever deed he does, of that will he reap the fruit " until he is saved ; good and evil are the most real things in his existence, but once he has shaken off his egoism, then the moral distinction has no longer any point. It is meaningless to speak of God as doing right and wrong. " Whosoever is begotten of God cannot sin."* Augustine shows by the example of the mind of God that liberty in its perfect state has no place for wrong choosing but is at one with righteousness. Green argues that freedom is a choice of right, not wrong. It is not a choice between right and wrong. The passionate physical mental individual is not the real man. It is the envelope encompassing the person's real self. When the individual spirit realises its divine nature and acts on its realisation, it transcends the distinction of good and evil. Good and evil presuppose the basis of egoism. Good acts are those which aim at the well-being of oneself and others, and evil ones are those which interfere with the well-being of oneself and others. Where exactly the line between self and others falls depends on convention. The essence of evil lies in invading what is regarded as another's sphere. While all kinds of actions based on the conception of a separate self are in essence evil, the term wrongdoing is reserved for those actions in which one's egoism goes so far as to break from its own sphere into that of another in order to deny it. From ethical or non-ethical conduct higher or lower forms of rebirth ensue. By the constant practice of goodness is finally attained the highest form of existence in which man becomes capable of the experience of union with the universal soul. While ethical life can give rise to a better existence, it cannot by itself effect release, which requires the shifting of the very basis of all life and activity. Dr. Schweitzer is right when he contends that " ethical conduct is only an aid to a better reincarnation but does not effect redemption." f Ethics presuppose the separatist view of life. When we ttanscend this view, we transcend ethical laws. St. Paul says : " If ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law." J The followers of Šamkara repudiate the Mlmãmsã view that works lead to salvation, and argue that spiritual insight ( jnãna ) is the only way to it. When the theory of " put a penny in the slot and pull out a pardon " became fashionable in Christianity, Luther held that justification is by faith alone and not by works. Release is eternal while pursuit of works is transient. The latter is helpful in hindering the hindrances to spiritual life. The conception of saintliness which is beyond good and evil is not an invitation to practise unethical conduct. Katha Upanisad declares that " he who has not ceased from immoral conduct cannot obtain God through intelligence. "§ Immoral conduct (duscarita) and spiritual life are incompatible, since the eternal is pure and free of all evil ( apahatapãpmã ). That state of purity ( tat subhram) can be apprehended only by those " Whose nature is purified " (« visuddhasattva , vltarãga ).** * I John iii. 9. t Page 165. { See also I John iii. 6, 9, 14. § I. 2. 24. ** Mundaka Upanisad II. 2. 7.</page><page sequence="26">782 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS July 2, 1937 God is both truth and virtue.* " Only when one's whole nature is purified are the bonds released which keep the soul from God."f X The last criticism which we shall deal with is that Hindu ethics treat inner perfection and inward calm as of more importance than outward activity. Dr. Schweitzer contrasts " the inactive ethic of perfecting the self alone " with the active enthusiastic love of one's neighbour. J Hindu ethics held before man as the highest aim " that he should endeavour to attain to the right composure, the right inwardness, the right ethical attitude of mind and the true peace of soul."§ Hindu ethics will plead guilty to this charge. Spiritual strenuousness, meditation, the freeing of the mind from hatred, anger and lust are emphasised in Hindu codes of morality. We just seek the eternal with all our power, with purified emotion, illumined mind and reflective will. By renouncing all individual petty claims, we draw nearer the goal, and by losing ourselves we find true freedom. The Mahãbhãrata says, " For a knower of Brahman there is no wealth comparable to unity, sameness, truthfulness, virtue, steadfastness, non-injury, candour and withdrawal from all activities."** There is no reason why we should regard self-perfecting as a species of inactivity. To harness the restless steeds of the senses, to subdue the passions and evil impulses which lead us away from our real nature, is all simply a part of ethics. The root of all evil is desire, which determines will and act. It cannot be said that those who aim at perfecting themselves are doing something non-ethical simply because they are not " troubled over many things " but have " chosen the better part." What appears to be passivity is intense concentration of consciousness where the soul lays hold immediately and ineffably on divine reality. The opposite of outward action is not inaction but inward action. Buddha went to a rich farmer of Benares and asked alms of him. He said to Buddha, " I having ploughed and sowed wheat ; you, on the other hand, propose to eat without ploughing and sowing." Buddha replied that he was engaged in an even more important tillage of the spirit. " Faith is the seed, penance the rain, understanding my yoke and plough, modesty the pole of the plough, mind the tie, thoughtfulness my ploughshare and goad . . . Exertion is my beast of burden, carrying me without turning back to the place, where, having gone, one does not grieve ... So this ploughing is ploughed ; it bears the fruit of immortality." What is called passivity is not necessarily inertia. * Brhadananyaka Upanisad II. 5. 11. t Chãndogya Upanisad V. 10. 7. Î Pages 5, 8-9. § Page 9.

Self-knowledge is the way to salvation. For the sake of this knowledge some enter monasteries and hermitages - not because they are afraid of life or are cowardly, but in order that they may train themselves for the work of the world and approach it with an inextinguishable hope, a vision of divine purpose at work, with a deeper peace in the acceptance of sorrow and a beauty of holiness. If they do not at once rush into the world, it is because they are afraid lest they soil it. Asceticism has entered far too deeply into the texture of religious life for it to be regarded as a mistake, though our critics would now generally regard any attempt to withdraw from the life of the world in order to gain greater purity of motive and energy of spirit as a case of forsaking our duties to our neighbour. Morality is not merely a question of laws and conventions, but one of purity of mind, with action as its outward manifestation. What is this life, if full of care We have no time to stand and stare ? (W. H. Davies). It is of more importance to feed and fertilise the spiritual depths in us than to pick up and exploit a few random ideas. Inner perfection and outer conduct are not exclusive of each other. They are two sides of one life. Unity with the eternal as a characteristic of the human spirit involves unity with man. Love is organic to spiritual life. While the eyes are lifted up to the Eternal, the arms are stretched to embrace the whole creation. The two movements are merged in the one all-inclusive act. Self-knowledge is accompanied by a perception of the unity of things (ekatvam anupasyati ). When one no longer sees any more multiplicity (nãnãtvam na pasyati ), one then moves at ease in the world of spirit and the world of sense. Contemplation and action, the yoga of Krishna and the dhanus or the archery of Arjuna, are two halves of one whole. The Chairman said : I should like to propose for your acceptance a vote of cordial thanks to Sir Sarvepalli for his lecture. He has been dealing with topics of fundamental importance. It is important that we should have a serious understand- ing of the thought that underlies the religious activities of the hundreds of millions of our fellow-subjects in India. It is important, because it is only through mutual understanding of the bases of the various religions that we are likely to achieve anything in the nature of a world religious fellowship, and it is a spirit of fellowship between these religions that the world most needs to-day. Very many people cannot see Religion for the religions. They do not understand and are unable to emphasise the common element that exists in them all. It is only when we have that mutual understanding that we shall be able to achieve, instead of a spirit of conflict and competition, a spirit of co-operation. Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan has put us under an obligation, because he has given us a sense of the underlying ideas of Hinduism. He has so complete a mastery of his topic that he has been able, without using any notes, to give us an hour's</page><page sequence="28">784 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS July 2, 1937 lecture, so rich in intellectual and spiritual content.

At the same time I should like to propose a vote of thanks to the Chairman himself.
