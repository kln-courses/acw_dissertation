<plain_text><page sequence="1">St Aldhelm's bees (De uirginitate prosa cc. IV- VI): some observations on a literary tradition AUGUSTINE CASIDAY Although the classic comparison of monks to bees owes its enduring success chiefly to the Vita S. Antonii , one of the most interesting developments of that simile is found in the prose treatise De uirginitate by Aldhelm of Malmesbury. In his writings, Aldhelm demonstrates familiarity with most of the conven- tional similes - monks are like bees in their industry, their intelligence, their chastity, and so on - but he also insists that monks are like bees in their Vol- untary solidarity' and obedience to leadership. This is a novel claim, one that I will argue Aldhelm makes by introducing a theme known from other Christian (and pagan) literature into his advice to nuns. The present article will describe the traditions incorporated by Aldhelm into his claim that monks, like bees, are obedient to a fault. In this way, this article will offer a broad view of the liter- ary heritage to which Aldhelm's treatise belongs and in which it should be interpreted. This will entail an assessment of which sources Aldhelm likely knew. While this assessment is indebted to the excellent notes by Rudolf Ehwald (as indeed all scholarship subsequent to Ehwald must be), it will not be bound by Ehwald's conclusions.1 In some instances, I will posit sources not mentioned by, and perhaps not detected by, Ehwald; in others, I will with trep- idation suggest refinements to Ehwald's work. It is hoped that on these grounds the article will be useful to students both of late antique monasticism and of Anglo-Saxon England. Since this is the goal of the article, it will be con- venient to begin each section with an excerpt from Aldhelm and follow it with the relevant antecedents; each section will then be concluded with a return to Aldhelm; this will allow us to appreciate the distinctiveness of Aldhelm's con- tribution. The article itself will be concluded with an overview of the compar- isons and of the relationship between the earlier writings and Aldhelm's. INDUSTRY Aldhelm's De uirginitate is an opus geminatum^ a 'twinned' work, so called because it consists of a prose version and a poetic version. That the versions are not 1 Aldhelmi Opera , ed. R. Ehwald, MGH Auct. antiq. 15 (Berlin, 1919). 1</page><page sequence="2">Augustine Casiday identical is evident, for example, from the fact that the simile about bees that concerns us here is lacking from the poetic version. The prose treatise is in the form of a letter addressed to Hildelith, abbess of a monastery in Barking, Essex, and the sisters with her (an establishment mentioned by Bede).2 Aldhelm first brings his readers' attention to the bees in the elaborate - indeed, overly elaborate - compliment that he pays to the dedicatees of the treatise. He congratulates them on their devotion to study of scripture and their discipline. First, he likens them to athletes, with an eye to I Cor. IX.24 ('all run indeed, but one wins the prize') and to Vergil (quoting Aeneid XI. 875). It is not unusual for Aldhelm, whose knowledge of Vergil was considerable,3 to pair secular and sacred literature in this way. Then, with an extremely tenuous transition, Aldhelm adds to his convoluted salutation the figure of the bee.4 Or, to be more precise, he adds the simile of the bee's industry: '. . . the richest experi- ence of life clearly declares that the industry of the highly industrious bee might be adapted to the aforementioned schemes of examples'.5 He adduces three examples. First, bees pour out across the fields to 'gather honeyed mois- ture drop by drop in their mouths and, as if with the treacly must of the sweet wine made for royal feasts, they struggle eagerly to fill the greedy receptacles of their stomachs'. Second, they take from the blossoms of the willow and the broom 'their fertile booty' from which 'they build waxen castles'. Third, from the ivy and lime tree, they derive the substances needed to build the honey- comb. Aldhelm amplifies the last point with two learned quotations (the first, he points out rather pedantically, in catalectic verse; the second, in a brachicat- alectic) from Caelius Sedulius's Carmen pas chale, praef. 13 and 14. With this much said, it is high time for Aldhelm to explain himself. The nuns, he writes, are similar because they, too, roam 'widely through the flower- ing fields of scripture'. He mentions in particular the prophets who foretold the coming of the Saviour; the Mosaic laws; the gospels - together with the commentaries of the catholic Fathers, who used the methods of historia, , alle- gorìa, tropologia and anagoge', and finally the historians and the grammarians. This five-fold curriculum is predicated on the gospels. The gospels provide the 2 Bede, Historia ecclesiastica IV. 6-10 (ed. B. Colgrave and R. A. B.

The last two items, the historians and the grammarians, are included because (at least from the time of Augustine's De doctńna christiand) competence in these subjects had been expected of would-be biblical scholars.6 That bees are hardworking animals is platitudinous. In a declamation by ps.- Quintilian, we are told that the three chief natural characteristics of bees are thriftiness, loyalty and industry.7 Roughly three centuries later, Ambrose draws the attention of nuns to bees, ťfor worthy is that virginity which can be com- pared to bees - so industrious, so modest, so temperate'.8 And, in the fifth century, Salvian upbraids his fellow Christians by appealing to the natural industry of the bees and contrasting this to the habitual shifdessness of his peers.9 The simile about industry recurs in the form of exhortations to one's reader to produce a meaningful compound out of what has been gleaned from experience (not least the experience of reading). Thus, Seneca exhorts Lucilius to separate out 'whatever we have collected from diverse readings' and 'to mix these juices together into a single delicacy' - just as bees do.10 In arguably the most influential monastic uita , the IJfe of St Antony , Antony is portrayed as seeking out ever-more-advanced disciplines 'like a clever bee'.11 In a treatise ascribed to Ephrem the Syrian which circulated in Greek, the author was sim- ilarly moved by consideration of the bee, hard at work, and invoked her example to spur on the monk to diligence: 'Have a care for yourself, lest you should lapse into carelessness: for the tyranny of carelessness is the source of destruction. Recall the bee and behold her wondrous mystery, how from the flowers scattered throughout the earth she accomplishes her work. Consider, then, her thriftiness . . ,'12 The impact of this conceit is evident in the consid- erably later Greek anthology of monastic lore, the Pratum spirituale , the very tide of which depends upon that simile.13 But it influenced Latin Christian 6 E.g., Augustine, De doctrina Christiana II.xxviii.42. 105 (for history), III.xxix.40.87-8 (for grammar) (ed.

This is particularly evident from the theme of 'spiritual honey' that we often meet and to which we shall soon turn. Before turning to that topic, we would do well to note that Aldhelm has modified the traditional monastic simile that bees and monks are industrious, by introducing the topic of scriptural exposition. When Aldhelm mentions this topic, he does so by invoking terms and techniques that indicate his familiarity with traditional methods of exegesis. What makes this stand out is that the authors we have considered so far typically regarded mundane physical activ- ities (for example, manual labour or pilgrimage) as evidence for monastic industry. By contrast, Aldhelm emphasizes reading and interpreting scripture and holy tradition as a form of industry; this hearkens back to Seneca's advice to Lucilius when he encouraged him to cull worthwhile bits from his reading. It is certainly appropriate that Aldhelm should begin his florilegium on virgin- ity by expressing his approval for hard work in the form of collecting, present- ing and thereby interpreting monastic lore for the benefit of others. Even if he cannot echo John Moschus 's claim to have personally visited the people about whom he writes and witnessed the fruits of their extraordinary commitment to God, Aldhelm can nevertheless take some satisfaction in having culled choice passages about their lives to edify the nuns of Barking.14 The distinctiveness of Aldhelm's use of the industrious bee is also evident when we consider a sub- set of this simile - the 'spiritual honey' that the bees' industry produces. 'Spiritual honey Several late antique authors wrote about 'spiritual honey', though Aldhelm differs from all of them because he takes the bee to represent the religious who are extracting spiritual sense from scripture. By contrast, the bees in question are variously treated in the antecedent literature. In one instance, they are expli- citly identified as bishops, distilling the sense of scripture for the benefit of the laity; in two others, it appears that the bees should be understood as the laity themselves; and in other cases, though it is clear that the bees stand for monks, it is not at all clear whether the monks are distilling scripture. Since this last type can be disposed of quickly, we will consider it first. It is found in Fortunatus's Carmen IV.xi, his 'Epitaph for Victorian', and in the Paraenesis ad ascetas in the Greek corpus of Ephrem's writings. In the latter, we read, 'A monk should speak chiefly in sweet phrases: for honey has no bitterness. Let not the chief worker of righteousness be careless: for the bee works cease- lessly.'15 As for Fortunatus's epitaph, Victorian was the abbot of the monastery of St Martin in Asan, Spain and died in 558. With regard to the success of Victorian's abbacy, Fortunatus says that he 'established many examples for the 14 Cf. Aldhelm, De uirginitate prosa , c. xix (ed.

Phrantzoles, p. 350). 4</page><page sequence="5">St Aldhelm fs bees (De uirginitate prosa, cc. iv- vi) monks; the bee made honey from eternal flowers'.16 Fortunatus regrettably does not tell us more about this honey 'made from eternal flowers', leaving us to wonder from which flowers Victorian made it. Perhaps he was like Gregory of Nyssa, who writes that he extracted spiritual honey from the writings of Ephrem the Syrian;17 but this is conjecture. By contrast, the other cases are explicit: the spiritual honey is produced from scripture. The longest of them is from Maximus of Turin, even though it is almost certainly fragmentary.18 What we have is basically an exordium but it is particularly interesting because in it Maximus reflects on how bishops are like bees: I ought, brethren, to preach something richer after these several days, and refresh you with a sweet sermon now that I have returned from such a swarm of bishops. I said 'swarm of bishops' rightly, since like the bee they make sweet honey from the blossoms of Divine scriptures, and whatever pertains to the medicine of souls they compound by the skill of their mouth. Bishops are justly compared to bees since like the bee they display chastity of the body, they offer the food of heavenly life and they exercise the sting of the law. For they are pure in order to sanctify, sweet in order to refresh and severe in order to punish. They should obviously be compared to bees who are kept, as it were, in a sort of beehive by the grace of Mother Church, in which they produce many swarms of Christians from the one swarm of the Saviour and by their most sweet preaching make little cells of various merits.19 By contrast, the other sources attest that this form of bee-like industry is not the exclusive domain of bishops. About a century and a half earlier, Ambrose had written: 'The bee is fed by the dew, knows no intercourse, and compounds honey. The virgin's dew is likewise divine discourse, since the words of God fall like the dew. [. . .] The virgin's offspring is the fruit of her lips, which lacks any bitterness and is rich with sweetness.'20 Although Ambrose adds the excep- tional remark that the bees feed on dew, rather than blossoms,21 he neverthe- less affirms that they extract sweet spiritual honey from the words of God. In 16 Fortunatus, 'Epitaphium Victoriani abbatis de monasterio Asane' (ed. M. Reydellet (Paris, 1994), 1, 143-4). The biographical details for Victorian given above are taken from Reydelleťs notes ad loc. 17 Gregory Nyssen, In sanctum Ephraim (PG 46, col. 825). 18 This is almost certainly a fragment because it does not relate Maximus doing precisely what he has announced he would do: preach a sweet sermon, drawn from scripture. 19 Maximus of Turin, Collectio sermonům antiqua LXXXIX (ed. A. Mutzenbecher, CCSL 23 (Turnhout, 1962), p. 364). Ambrose, De uirginihus I.viii.40 (ed. F. Gori, p. 140); cf. his Expositio psalmi cxviii , XlII.xxiii (ed. M. Petschenig, CSEL 62 (Vienna, 1913), p. 294). 21 It should be noted that at De uirginihus I.viii.41 and 43, Ambrose does say that the bee feeds on flos rather than on ros. In his edition of the text, E. Cazzaniga emended flos to ros at I.viii.41, but this is a questionable emendation because flos recurs at I.viii.43. Ambrose's description at I.viii.40 depends on ros and at I.viii.41- 3 it depends on flos , so it would appear that he simply preferred a stylish transition to slavish consistency. 5</page><page sequence="6">Augustine Casidajj his warning to monks against the dangers of nodding off during the reading of scripture or during the sermon, Ephrem appeals to a very similar image: 'Pluck from them remedies for the soul, just like a wise bee collecting honey from the flowers.'22 Here, the monk is intended to extract medicine for the soul from the readings he hears in church. Likewise, in one of his sermons Caesarius says to his audience that, 'like most prudent bees, [you] faithfully hasten to Christ's beehive so that you can partake of the sweetness of spiritual honey from the holy readings'.23 While it could be argued that Caesarius is calling the listeners to receive the honey he has derived from scripture, this seems implausible: he has, after all, just likened them to the bees and honey is made by bees. In other words, Caesarius is not suggesting that in his capacity as bishop he has extracted spiritual honey for the benefit of the faithful; instead, he is calling them to make spiritual honey from the holy readings that are provided for them. In a comparable passage, Caesarius upbraids all Christians, lay, clerical and monas- tic, for failing to produce spiritual honey.24 Because Ambrose and Ephrem had made monastic Christians (and not necessarily only those in orders) out to be the bees who derive honey from spiritual reading, Aldhelm's call for the nuns of Barking to emulate bees in just this way is not unprecedented. Even as he praises their intelligence and diligence for having 'subdy investigated bit by bit and stage by stage' such abstruse questions as the scriptural distinction of the 'inner man' and 'outer man',25 he encourages them to continue in this good work. WISDOM The praise Aldhelm gave to his nuns' intellectual vigour points up another salient aspect of the simile from bees: bees, and monks, are intelligent. We have already encountered this characteristic of the bees when we read, in the excerpt from Caesarius's sermons, his description of bees as prudentissimae. That bees are 'most prudent' is evident from the skill they display in producing honey. Skill is one of the signal attributes of the prudent person. But prudens also des- ignates intelligence. Although Aldhelm does not make a sharp or clear distinc- tion between prudentia as intelligence and prudentia as skill, his description of how the nuns read scripture nevertheless makes it quite obvious that he has in 22 Ephrem graecus, De recta uiuendi ratione 36 (ed. K. G. Phrantzoles). 23 Caesarius, Sermo CCVII.ii (ed. D. Morin, CCSL 104 (Turnhout, 1953), pp. 829-30): ťMagis enim de uestra deuotione confidens credo uos uelud apes prudentíssimas ad aluearium Christi fide- liter festinare, ut dulcedinem spiri talis mellis ex diuinis lectionibus pos sitis accipere, et cum propheta dicere: quam dulcía faucibus meis eloquia tua, Domine, super mel et fauum ori meo.' 24 Caesarius, Sermo CLVI.v (ed. Morin, p. 638). 25 Aldhelm, De uirginitate prosa , c. iii (ed. Ehwald, p. 231). 6</page><page sequence="7">StAldhelm's bees (De uirginitate prosa, cc. iv- vi) mind both senses of the word. The interpretative gymnastics they are capable of undertaking attest to intellectual subdety, and also intellectual ¡skill.26 He makes several statements about the interpretative process, all of which stress the high level of intellectual activity characteristic of interpretation, within his extended analogy of bees flying through a glade. Let us return to the passage just examined and note the several references to intelligence and understand- ing that it features. In the first instance, it is the nuns' 'remarkable mental dis- position' that Aldhelm likens to bees. This disposition leads them to plumb 'the divine oracles of the ancient prophets foretelling long in advance the advent of the Saviour with certain affirmations' and to engage in the four-fold interpre- tation of scripture under the headings of literal, allegorical, topological and anagogie sense. Finally, he claims that the nuns have been motivated in their precocity to consult historians and grammarians so as to facilitate their under- standing of scripture. Such extensive measures attest to a considerable theoret- ical foundation no less than to an impressive practical aptitude.27 Once more, in the matter of bees' intelligence, Aldhelm is treading well- worn ground. One might even call it batde-scarred ground, for the question of whether or not bees could be meaningfully considered intelligent was widely debated. Vergil initiated the discussion by referring to the 'divine intelligence' of bees.28 This was well within his prerogatives as a poet; but it is somewhat surprising to find that the naturalist Hyginus entertained similar beliefs.29 On the other hand, the rather more pragmatic Columella considered it a topic not worthy of serious discussion: with an all but audible scoff, Columella notes that farmers have more important things to do than propagate fairy tales and pore over literature.30 But if the topic did not merit the attention of practical agron- omists, it certainly detained the attention of philosophers. For instance, in rebutting Celsus, Origen stipulates that bees are not reasoning creatures and therefore they cannot be praised for their actions (or, more to the point, the significance of humans' rational actions cannot be minimized by comparing 26 See Aldhelm, De uirginitate prosa , c. iii: ť. . . ita interioris qualitatem, qui cadesti afflatus spira- culo iuxta Geneseos relatum creditur, a uestra prudentia membratim et particulatim subtiliter inuestigatam reor' (ed. Ehwald, p. 231). In this passage, he also praises the nuns' discipline and industry - which point to the skill involved in prudentia - and their sagacity and subtlety - which point to the intelligence involved in prudentia. Note that he does not mention uirgines sapientes until De uirginitate prosa , c. xlviii (ibid. p. 302). 27 Aldhelm, De uirginitate prosa, c. iv: 'uestrum . . . memoriale mentis ingenium'; 'diuina priscorum prophetarum oracula certis adstipulationibus iamdudum saluatoris aduentum uaticinantia enixius inuestigando'; etc. (ibid. p. 232). 28 Vergil, Georgics IV.219- 21 (ed.

Lundström et al., p. 640) 7</page><page sequence="8">Augustine Casiday them to what bees do).31 According to Origen, bees act according to their providential design - a view also found in a homily by one of Basil's disciples and indeed in one of Aldhelm's letters.32 On a comparable note, Seneca assigns the skills exhibited by bees and particularly their co-operation to a natural desire for self-preservation.33 Despite this dismissive treatment by philosophers and naturalists, the image of the 'wise bee' persists in the literature. The great poet and theologian, Gregory Nazianzen, concluded one of his homilies with a florid, quasi-architectural description of bees' cells; then he added, 'So it befits us, too - Christ's apiary - and let us take this example of wisdom and industry.'34 Wisdom is evident in the well-ordered proportions of the cell, but also in the forethought demonstrated by bees who store up honey for the future. (In Gregory's hands, this becomes an occasion to exhort his audience to hospitality: like bees, good Christians ought to make provisions for entertaining guests!) Furthermore, Evagrius of Antioch's Latin translation of the Life of St Antony tells us that the great hermit was 'like a wise bee' when he went from ascetic to ascetic, learning and perfecting his ascetic skills.35 Even if for different reasons, Ambrose likewise thought virgins should emulate 'that wise bee'.36 These cases have in common an extremely practical sensibility. In all of them, the primary evidence for wisdom and intelligence is moral know-how. As we have seen, Aldhelm emphasizes both the practical skill of the nuns and their intellectual acuity - both at the same time by referring to the example of a swarm of bees seeking out the right flowers and compounding honey from them. But, to reiterate a theme, Aldhelm's decision to correlate the nuns' exegetical acumen with the symbol of the bee is a new departure. The well- established (if, in some quarters, controversial) precedent for appealing to the wisdom and intelligence of the bees notwithstanding, Aldhelm reworks the tra- dition in a strikingly original way by appealing to the figure of speech in order to connote a very sophisticated level of intellectual culture. 31 Origen, Contra Celsum IV.lxxxi (ed.

As we have seen, these associa- tions are time-honoured and when he thus compliments the nuns, Aldhelm appeals to a literary tradition that he may well have expected the nuns to appre- ciate. However, it comes as a surprise that Aldhelm makes litde of a far more obvious aspect of the metaphor - the chastity of bees. Because the ancients never observed sexual reproduction among bees, many assumed that bees must reproduce asexually. As Pliny notes, 'How they produce offspring was a major and subtle question among the learned - for bees' intercourse has never been seen. Previously, most believed they were produced from the mouth by blend- ing reed and olive flowers; others, from the intercourse of that bee in the swarm who is called the king . . .'37 The belief that bees reproduce asexually had been advanced by no less an authority than Vergil.38 This was a thoroughly useful device for Christian polemicists, since it provided a ready example of virgin birth.39 Sometimes, though, Christians simply mention the asexual reproduction of bees in passing, without imputing any obvious significance to it. In such a case, one suspects that the reason this claim is inserted into a dis- cussion where it is completely irrelevant, is simply so the author can demon- strate a knowledge of Vergil.40 By contrast, St Ambrose integrated this belief into his presentation of con- secrated virginity.41 In a passage we have already met twice from his treatise De uirginibusy Ambrose praises the virtues of the anthropomorphic bee and encourages the Christian virgin to attain these virtues: 'How I wish, O daugh- ter, that you would imitate this little bee, whose food is the flower, whose off- shoot is collected and composed by its mouth. Imitate this bee, O daughter!'42 In this account, the figure of the bee attains almost mythic status, for Ambrose intricately relates every convention we have encountered so far and incorpo- rates them under the claim that bees are virginal creatures. Aldhelm's rationale and approach appears to be more straightforwardly Pauline: those who are chaste have fewer cares for the world; in connection with the bees at least, Aldhelm shows little or no interest in chastity as such.43 37 Pliny, Histońa naturalis XI.xvi.46 (ed. L. Ian and C. Mayhoff (Leipzig, 1892-1909), p. 297). 38 Vergil, Georgics IV. 197 (ed. Ribbeck, p. 184). 3 Thus, John Cassian, De incarnańone Domini VII.v.4 (ed. M.

And we know from Jerome and Augustine that there is a long and venerable tradition of retirement from the cares of the world for the sake of Christian learning.44 In other words, Aldhelm shows surprisingly little interest in praising the nuns' chastity as such: he shows more interest in particular virgins than in abstract virginity. Aldhelm's relative lack of interest in virginity as such is perhaps attributable to the status of his addressees as married women who had retired into chastity - 'born-again virgins', so to speak.45 Aldhelm's circumspection in praising virginity and his sensitivity in praising chastity are evidently related to their status.46 There is no compelling reason to suppose that the aforemen- tioned passages from Christian literature had any particular impact upon Aldhelm's thought; it is more economic to suppose that he got his belief in the asexual reproduction of bees immediately from Vergil, whose works he knew. The virginal church But an interesting aside that Aldhelm makes when writing about bees' chastity deserves some further consideration. He writes, ťThe bee, I say, by virtue of the special attribute of its peculiar chastity, is by the undoubted authority of the scriptures agreed to signify a type of virginity and the likeness of the church . . .'47 It is curious, given how slight is Aldhelm's interest in the bee-like chastity of nuns, that he should incorporate this not particularly intuitive com- parison of the 'chaste bee' to the church. One might suppose that the conjunc- tion of Virginal bees' and Virginal church' - the latter a very widely attested 44 E.g. Augustine, Confessionum libri tredecim VI.xii.21 and VI.xiv.24 (ed. L.

Ehwald, pp. 236-40). It would not be amiss in this context to note that the status of the nuns at Barking is not a uniquely Anglo-Saxon phe- nomenon. Examples of marriages set aside for the pursuit of consecrated Virginity' are known in eastern ascetic literature (e.g. Apophthegmata Carion 2 (PG 65, cols. 249-51); Cassian, Conlationes XXI.ix passim (ed. Petschenig, pp. 581-4)). Ambiguous parallels are available in the west: e.g. the celebrated chaste marriages of Paulinus and Therasia (note his description of the common life that she and he share with eight others in Nola, and also his praise of a chaste marriage in the epithalamium for Julian of Aeclaum: Carm. XXI.272- 93 and XXV (ed. W. Härtel, CSEL 30 (Vienna, 1894), pp. 167 and 238-45) and of Melania and Pinianus (see Anon., Vita s. Melaniae I-VI (ed. D.

Granting this possibility, it is still worth noting that a precedent for explicitly comparing the virginal church to virginal bees is found in a sermon by Peter Chrysologus. Let no one wonder if the holy church - a virgin mother - produces numerous offspring with heavenly fertility, personally bears pastors for herself and personally begets rectors. For the bee - knowing no intercourse, ignorant of unchastity and set apart from corruption; as a model of modesty, an exemplar of chastity and a symbol of vir- ginity - who from mere heavenly dew conceives by the mouth, [also] delivers by the mouth, compounds chaste seeds by the mouth, makes leaders for itself by the mouth and personally generates and produces kings for itself by the mouth . . ,49 One seldom finds the church mentioned at all in connection with the bee- simile. When this connection is made, the church is often peripheral. A good example, and helpful contrast to Chrysologus and Aldhelm, is found in a homily by Caesarius of Aries. Caesarius talks of 'Christ's beehive', a curious term that he later glosses as 'the beehive of the church'.50 This is unexcep- tional. Since the bees are conventionally understood to represent Christians, it is easy to imagine the church as a kind of beehive. But the church itself is almost never compared to a bee. So it is Chrysologus 's (and, later, Aldhelm's) use of this vivid comparison that is surprising. Although no citations of Chrysologus are recorded in R. Ehwald's excellent index of Aldhelm's written sources,51 the fact that both Chrysologus and Aldhelm employ the conven- tional types in this unconventional way, indicates that further examination of Aldhelm's possible use of Chrysologus's sermons would be well worthwhile. 48 E.g.

Ehwald, p. 545. 11</page><page sequence="12">Augustine Casiday SOCIAL ORDER When we turn to traditional views of bees' social ordering and structure, we find that Aldhelm is amongst the proponents of a strongly anthropomorphic account. We will have occasion to note that this account is consistendy used by authors who seek to promote some particular vision of society. After a marvel- lously convoluted account of how bees are willing to abandon a perfectly cosy home at the command of 'that bee who among the others discharges the office of magistrate', Aldhelm adds the following rhetorical question: 'What, I ask, in the nature of visible things can be seen, that obeys the command of its beget- ter and strives to fulfil the order of its king with such great desire . . . ?'52 The lengthy question that follows - like the lengthy statement that preceded it - is intended to delight the reader while simultaneously edifying her. The reader's delight is enhanced by the recognition that Aldhelm has cleverly redirected the ancient perception that bees are orderly by finding in their orderliness a close correspondence with the monastic virtue of obedience. Although it is true that the ancients without exception found bees to be orderly animals, it is worth noting that they did not therefore necessarily sub- scribe to an anthropomorphic view of insects. Some ancient authors were content to observe order without deducing from it a moral lesson. For instance, Aristotle and Celsus both advanced straightforwardly naturalistic observations about bees and how bees live.53 Other authors resort to anthro- pomorphic language to describe bees' behaviour, but we know from other con- texts that these authors are strongly disinclined to perpetuate literary whimsy or political agendas. Varro is a good example: although he draws his vocabu- lary from the stock of political language ('these cities', he writes, 'are like men's, for here there are king, commands and society'), he does not seem to be unduly influenced by that choice of terms.54 Columella himself, whose own views about the worth of literature for farmers were extremely trenchant,55 indulges in some remarkable political metaphors to describe what can transpire in bee- hives. Thus, he advises against replacing the 'king bee' because the older bees, 'like a kind of Senate', might not be willing to obey their juniors and so might be put to death by the younger bees; elsewhere, he warns of 'sedition' erupting 52 Aldhelm, De uirginitate prosa , c. vi: 'ille, qui inter ceteras maģistrātus officio fungi tur'; 'Quid enim, quaeso, in rerum uisibilium uideri ualet natura, quod tarn ingenti studio auctoris sui praecepto pareat et regis imperium implere contendat. . . ?'

In other authors, however, the application of this political language is not far to seek. Seneca appeals to the case of bees to show that kingship is a naturally occurring phenomenon.59 Noting, as he thought, that 'king bees' have no sting, Seneca draws the moral that it is natural for kings to show clemency (a message he is keen to put across to Nero).60 A similar anecdote is preserved in Greek, for Dio Chrysostom relates that Diogenes addressed Alexander the Great with precisely the lesson of the 'king bee's' clemency.61 Both messages were no doubt timely. Dio 's peer, Plutarch, takes another lesson from the bee. He tells us that the Spartan ambassadors could, by their very presence, restore order to a throng of turbulent Hellenes - 'like bees who, when their leader appears, swarm together and put themselves in order'.62 The connection between the moral drawn by Seneca and Dio on the one hand, and Plutarch's story on the other, is that bees obediendy adhere to the order of their society. The implica- tion of this claim, sometimes made explicit, is that order and obedience are natural phenomena. A fourth-century commentary on creation, spuriously attributed to Eustathius of Antioch, elegandy makes the connection: 'Bees have a king, and they fly together and together they dwell; none of them trieś to leave before the king himself has taken to flight.'63 56 Columella, Res rustica IX.xi.2 and IX.xiii.9; this sort of description is also found, in less quot- able form, at IX.ix.l- 8 (ed. Lundström et al.^ pp. 662, 668 and 672). 57 Pliny, Naturalis histońa Xl.iv.l 1: 'Sed inter omnia ea principatus apibus et iure praecipua admi- rado . . .

Ehwald, p. 501). 13</page><page sequence="14">Augustine Casiday These trends come together very effectively in a discrete reference to bees found in a letter by Cyprian of Carthage, who noted that 'bees have a king'.64 It makes very good sense that Cyprian, whose tenure as primate of Africa coin- cided with great turmoil in the African churches, would seize upon the combi- nation of good order and obedience so readily.65 Cyprian's mention of the 'king bee' is in the context of an astringent letter in which he calls a certain Puppianus to obedience.66 The rigorist Puppianus was apparendy fomenting unrest by claiming that Cyprian was tainted by consorting with sinful clergy and that this taint was contagious. Cyprian responded by heaping scorn on Puppianus. He asserted that even dumb animals (such as bees) and thieves display more obedi- ence and loyalty than Puppianus was doing. In other words, he berates Puppianus with the example of the bee precisely because Puppianus's behaviour is less dignified than an animal's. It is unclear how much can be made of Cyprian's thinking on the basis of this ad hominem attack. But implicit in Cyprian's claim is the identification of the bishop with the 'king bee'. This fits neady within Cyprian's efforts to secure the integrity of a fissiparous Christian commu- nity by insisting on proper order. Cyprian demonstrated sensitivity in doing this, but he also was prepared (like the bishops described by Maximus of Turin) to be 'severe in order to punish'. Regardless of Seneca's and Dio 's fine beliefs and tolerant advice, Cyprian clearly had a sting and was prepared to use it. The flavour of Ambrose's remarks on bees' social order is very different. He begins by noting the amazing extent to which bees share everything in common. In his list, Ambrose includes their offspring, dwelling-place, work, food, activity, effort and its reward, will, procreation, virginal chastity and, rather more abstractly, the limits beyond which they do not fly.67 Ambrose goes on to note, however, that 'they nominate a king for themselves, make them- selves into a people and, though they may be under a king, they are free'.68 He expands upon this seemingly paradoxical claim by insisting that the king's rule is predicated on respect and devotion. Yet even though he states that the king is nominated and rules at the good pleasure of those he rules, Ambrose acknowledges that the 'king bee' is marked from birth with 'distinct signs' ('he is eminent by the dimensions of his body and his face and, what is chiefly important in a king, the meekness of his manner.')69 How such congenital fea- 64 Cyprian, Epistula LXVI. vi (ed.

In his Homiliae , which were much used by Ambrose, he flady states that "the king is not elected (^€i porovrjTos) by them (for often the masses lack of discernment puts the worst in power)'.71 Quite apart from the interest generated by Basil's more pessimistic remark, his claim is significant because the sharp difference between it and Ambrose's claim goes to show that precisely what an author makes of the perceived social order of bees is arbitrary. Furthermore, what the author makes of this order can provide some evidence of his social and political ideals. Bearing this in mind, we may well find it curious that, although monastic sources valued good order and obedience, and although we frequently meet the simile of bees in monastic literature, we rarely find any applications of the simile to monastic society. There is merely a single reference in Palladius's Lausiac History that points in the general direction of what we might expect. In his account of Elpidius of Cappadocia, an ascetic who dwelt in one of the caves of Mt Douka near Jericho, Palladius tells how Elpidius 's reputation gar- nered him many followers - including Palladius himself. In language redolent of the Life of St Antony, Palladius writes that A full measure of brethren assem- bled to live there (I too was there, for a time) just like bees around their king, and thus made a city of the mountain; and different ways of life were to be found in that place.'72 Palladius's remark is limited in scope. The monks may well have assembled around Elpidius like bees, but nothing in Palladius's testi- mony justifies the inference that the community was rigidly structured after the manner of a beehive: he makes no claims regarding Elpidius's authority over the assembled brethren. While it should not therefore be assumed that Palladius is uninterested in the proper ordering of monastic society, it is never- theless strange in light of what we found in Cyprian, Basil and Ambrose that Palladius does not exploit the opportunity he made by invoking bees to make a point about monastic life. More promising for our purposes is Jerome's letter to Rusticus about the monastic life. In this letter, Jerome categorically likens the monastery to a beehive, and he does so with particular reference to order and obedience. Along with other advice about how Rusticus might pass his time in an edifying fashion, Jerome writes, 'Construct an apiary for bees, to which Proverbs refers 70 Cf. G. Banterle's note ad loc regarding Valentinian II {ibid. p. 321). Pliny also notes that 'king bees' are distinguished from birth but, in contrast to Ambrose's political sensibilities, he allows that inferior specimens are destroyed in their youth: Historia naturalis XI.xvi.51 (ed. Ian and Mayhoffll, 299). 71 Basil, Homiliae in hexaemeron VIII.iv.9- 11 (ed. Giet, p. 448). 72 Palladius of Hellenopolis, Historia lausiaca XLVIII.ii (ed. Bartelink, p. 238); cf. Athanasius, Vita s.

Even dumb animals and packs of beasts follow their leaders. There are princes among the bees'. ; cranes follow one of their number in the shape of a letter [the letter &lt;Y']. There is one emperor, one provincial judge . . . the bishops of the churches are singular, the archpriests singular, the archdeacons singular - and every ecclesiastical order relies upon its rectors . . . And, lest I should disgust the reader by including too many examples, my speech tends for all this to one point: I would not teach you to be left to your own will, but rather that you ought to live in the monastery under the discipline of one father and in dealing with many. In this way, you will learn humility from one and patience from another; this one will teach you silence, that one, meekness.74 For many reasons, this is a significant passage. Jerome follows the precedent set by Seneca and Dio for extracting a principle of society from observations about natural order. Like Cyprian, he applies this principle within the Christian community. He is unlike Cyprian, however, in that his observation is propa- edeutic rather than polemic. When Jerome urges Rusticus to consider the bee, he follows this up with instruction on what this consideration ought to show. Furthermore, Jerome differs from Cyprian in that he is writing specifically about life in the monastery rather than about more general ecclesiastical polity. And when Jerome encourages Rusticus to learn the virtues that his confreres have personally developed to a high degree, we may detect an allusion to Athanasius^ account of St Antony, bee-like, going from ascetic to ascetic in order to distil the honey of monastic life. However, it should not escape our attention that the great Antony was father of the hermits; and what Jerome has in mind is definitely cenobitic. This letter contains not even the slightest hint that Jerome envisages a day when Rusticus will have learnt enough from the community to strike out on his own.75 What is chiefly remarkable about this letter is Jerome's synthesis of several identifiable but disparate strands within the literary tradition, which brings to light a new facet of the traditional simile: monks are like bees because they are obedient. Jerome merely sheds light on this new facet of the simile; Aldhelm cele- brates it. This also is to be remembered, I suggest, concerning the harmoni- ous fellowship of the bees, and to be admired as some theatrical spectacle - I mean the spontaneous inclination to voluntary servitude which they are 73 Jerome, Epistula CXXV.xi (ed. Labourt VII, 124); he refers to Prov. VHI.6a-b (LXX). 74 Ibid. CXXV.xv (ed. Labourt VII, 126-7). 75 This perspective can be contrasted to John Cassian, De institutos V.iv.l- Z (ed. 1 etschenig, CSEL 17 (1888), pp. 83-4), on which see below. 16</page><page sequence="17">St Aldhelm s bees (De uirginitate prosa, cc. iv-vi) known to exercise in obedience to their rulers.' The foregoing analysis of clas- sical and Christian literature should convince us that, just as Aldhelm has said, bees were thought to be inclined spontaneously to voluntary servitude. This far, Aldhelm might simply be following Jerome. But immediately hereafter, he strikes out on a rather more ambitious course than Jerome had done. 'In respect of this sort of consideration, are not all the disciplines of the monas- tic way of life and the regular practices of monasteries indicated by an extremely close comparison?'76 It is convenient for us to forego Aldhelm's 'extremely close comparison' and in its place substitute a drier and conciser summary. Like ps.-Eusthatius, Aldhelm observes that bees do not depart the hive without direction and while they remain in the hive, they care for it. If, on the other hand, the king bee should decree that 'their ancient dwellings' ought to be abandoned, they set off in swarms (much as Palladius's monks did) in search of a new home and so forsake the domestic comforts of famil- iarity. The bee, Aldhelm writes, exemplifies obedience for us 'mortals living in this vale of tears' by its 'spontaneous acceptance of devout servitude'.77 As he draws these reflections to a close, Aldhelm also recapitulates the bee's appropriateness as a symbol of unspotted virginity, and as the distiller of honey. At the mention of honey, he tirelessly sets off again - this time by comparing the virginal life to the angelic life, both of which are incomparably sweeter than the usual fare of life. With this, his attention decisively turns from bees. But we would do well to dwell a bit longer on what he has written in his last flourish. The only real precedent for Aldhelm's extraordinary remarks about the effectively monastic obedience of bees, is the aforementioned letter by Jerome. This very naturally leads one to pose the question of influence. Was Aldhelm following Jerome in this instance? Although that possibility cannot be ruled out, it seems to me a somewhat remote possibility. In the first place, there are no direct borrowings in Aldhelm's account, and in fact no parallels so close that one might propose literary dependence. Secondly, though Aldhelm was broadly familiar with Jerome's work, we do not have any evidence that he knew any of Jerome's letters.78 Third, even though we have found Jerome's lesson from the obedient bee to be evident across the relevant passage from the letter, by the close of the passage it has died away to an echo of the Life of St Antony. While the simile is an arresting way to introduce his calls for obedience (just as it was for Cyprian), Jerome was not sufficiently beguiled by the simile that he developed it in any significant way. This is altogether different from Aldhelm's extended meditation on the obedience of bees. Fourth, it is prima fade unlikely 76 Aldhelm, De uirginitate prosa , c. vi (ed. Ehwald, p. 233). 77 Ibid. Cf. Ehwald, Aldhelmi Opera , p. 545, sub nomine 'Hieronymus'. 17</page><page sequence="18">Augustine Casiday that Jerome would have been able to express his enthusiasm for good order and obedience as crisply as Aldhelm did. After all, Aldhelm wrote after the cel- ebrated work of Benedict had exerted a considerable influence along the lines of structuring Western monasdcism.79 Due to the impact of Benedict's Rule, we may well suppose that Aldhelm would have been more attuned to 'natural' evidence for order and obedience than Jerome was. Accordingly, even if Aldhelm did know Jerome's letter, intervening circumstances would have enabled Aldhelm to refine the point quite dramatically. Finally, as this article has shown and as we will note again in concluding, Aldhelm appears to have had at his disposal a considerable number of other sources for the tradition about bees. It is possible to account for what Aldhelm has written, even if Jerome's letter was not among those sources. In sum, so great is the difference between their accounts that one may doubt whether Aldhelm owes anything to Jerome at all, and suppose instead that the two of them arrived at this insight on different tracks. aldhelm's sources and his use of them This examination of Aldhelm's use of the bee as a type for the Christian nun has sought to uncover the broad literary antecedents of that simile. There is a considerably greater number of sources, both classical and Christian, wherein some mention of bees is made than what we have seen here. But, limiting our- selves to works that direcdy bear on Aldhelm's appropriation of the simile, we are still left with an impressive dossier. We will proceed by quickly recapitulat- ing which sources are relevant to which broad theme in Aldhelm's treatment. Then we will want to make some judgement regarding which sources likely had a direct impact on Aldhelm's writing, and which (helpful though they may be for appreciating what Aldhelm was up to in this knotty passage) were only part of the tradition. Among the sources that are helpful for background, but unlikely to have contributed direcdy to Aldhelm's writing, are the following: Aristode, Historia animalium' Varro, Res rusticae' Columella, Res rustica ; ps.-Quintilian, Declamatio XIII ; Seneca, De dementia and Epistulae morales, ; Plutarch, Lycurgus, Celsus, Alethes Logos, Origen, Contra Celsum' Dio Chrysostom, Orationes. ; Eustathius of Antioch, Commentarius in hexaemeron' ps. -Basil, Sermo in illud: (Ne dederis somnium oculis tui s' et c.' Gregory Nazianzen, In Machabaeorum laudem' Gregory Nyssen, In sanctum Ephrem' Cassian, De incarnatione Domini ; and Salvian, De gubernatione Dei. These sources contribute to a stock of images from which Aldhelm draws. But, although they are valuable for coming to grips with the nuances of Aldhelm's use of the simile, I find no reason to suppose that Aldhelm consulted any of 79 For Aldhelm's assessment of Benedict, see De uirginitate prosa , c. xxx (ed. Ehwald, pp. 268-9). 18</page><page sequence="19">St Aldhelm' s bees (De uirginitate prosa, cc. iv- vi) them or consciously referred to any of them. It need not surprise us that the two late ancient agricultural handbooks would not have had a direct impact upon Aldhelm, particularly in as much as Aldhelm seems to have been versed in Pliny and Vergil - who could well have supplied all the details regarding bees that we have considered. Apart from the works of Vergil and Pliny, Aldhelm 's knowledge of classical Latin literature is not comprehensive. We have no strong reason to suppose he knew Seneca or ps.-Quintilian.80 Although Aldhelm cites Rufinus 's prologue to his translation of some of Gregory Nazianzen's Orationes , the In Machabeorum laudem is not among them.81 Cassian's De incarnatione Domini did not enjoy a wide circulation;82 and the slight rele- vance of an aside in Salvian's De gubernatione Dei hardly instils confidence that Aldhelm had read it. With respect to the Greek literature, even though Aldhelm passed some time in Canterbury during the extraordinary archiepis- copacy of Theodore, when Greek books were available, none of the aforemen- tioned tides feature prominendy in the reconstructed 'library catalogue' for the Canterbury school.83 In the case of a few of the other passages considered above, we can be more confident that Aldhelm knew the works in which they appeared and so we can reasonably suppose that they might have direcdy influenced him. The two most obvious such cases are the various excerpts from Pliny's Naturalis historia and Vergil's Georgics . But it is also known that Fortunatus 's Carmina were popular in Anglo-Saxon England.84 His poem for Victorian may have been known to Aldhelm. Other works that figure into the literary convention, such as the works of Greek Ephrem (De recta uiuendi ration e , Paraenesis ad ascetas and Sermo ascéticas) and the Homiliae in hexaemeron of Basil the Great, may well have been available in Theodore's Canterbury. (Michael Lapidge has advanced this claim on the basis of material present in the Canterbury biblical com- mentaries.)85 Indeed, Aldhelm mentions a translation of Basil's Hexaemeron 80 See the discussion by T. J. Brown (above, p. 2, n. 3). 81 Aldhelm, De uirginitate prosa , c. xxvii (ed. Ehwald, p. 263); Rufinus, Tyrannii Rufini Orationum Gregońi Naņianņeni nouem interpretatio (ed. A.

This leaves us with a handful of ambiguous passages. For instance, in the matter of bees reproducing asexually, numerous Christian authors express that belief; but since Aldhelm knew Vergil (in whose Georgics that belief was clearly stated), it is difficult to claim with any conviction that the Christian authors had any direct impact upon Aldhelm with respect to this claim. Indeed, since Aldhelm is not particularly disposed to make much of the supposed virginal reproduction of bees - something most of the Christians who attest to this belief were quite keen to do - I think it is highly unlikely that Aldhelm owes his knowledge of this ancient belief to them. It is opportune in this connection to point out that, even though we have repeatedly made reference to the Life of St Antony , there is no conclusive evi- dence that Aldhelm had any significant knowledge of that work. I do not argue that the Ufe was unavailable to him; it probably was.87 However, it must be acknowledged that his mention of Antony in the roster of notable virgins is replete with generalities and invokes Antony's reputation in very vague terms before any mention is made of the written version.88 The only concrete details he offers about Antony are either totally banal (Aldhelm knows that Antony was Egyptian) or totally baffling (Aldhelm inexplicably associates Antony with the cenobitic movement). Because Aldhelm refers his readers to Athanasius 's work, or rather to Evagrius's translation of that work, for specific details, one may doubt whether Aldhelm actually knew much about the details of Antony's life. I would offer two conjectures on the provenance of Aldhelm's information about Antony. First, Aldhelm's mention of Evagrius as the translator suggests that he might have cribbed his information from Jerome. Certainly, Jerome's incisive entries for Athanasius, Antony and Evagrius are sufficient to account 86 Aldhelm, De uirginitate prosa , c.xxvii (ed. Ehwald, p. 263). It may be noted in this connection that Aldhelm may well have known the work in Eustathius's Latin translation, rather than in Rufinus's (as Ehwald supposed: ibid. p. 263, n. 8). Aldhelm merely says the homilies in latinům translata leguntur , but does not tell us who translated the version he has in mind. Furthermore, Rosalind Love has shown that Bede's Commentańus in Genesim is based in part on Eustathius's work (R. C. Love, 'The Sources of Bede, Commentańus in Genesim (Libri I et II) (L.F.2.1.105, L.F.2. 1.035, L.F.2.1.030, L.F.2.1.019, L.F.2.1.018)', Fontes Anglo-Saxoniä: World Wide Web Register, http://fontes.english.ox.ac.uk/ (2000), accessed October 2002). Might it not have been available to Aldhelm as well? This Eustathius is not to be confused with 'Eustathius of Antioch', mentioned above (see p. 13, n. 63). 87 This view can be advanced on the basis of glosses to the Latin translation of the 1 Ata S. Antonii in the 'Leiden Glossary'; see J. H. Hessels, A Fate Eighth-Century Latin- Anglo-Saxon Glossary preserved in the Library of the Leiden University (Cambridge, 1906), pp. 22-3. 88 Aldhelm, De uirginitate prosa , c. xxviii (ed. Ehwald, pp. 264-5). 20</page><page sequence="21">St Aldhelm's bees (De uirginitate prosa, cc. iv- vi) for the information Aldhelm relays about Antony.89 Second, his strange remark about Antonian cenobitism may be attributable to a faulty recollection of a passage by John Cassian. Cassian attributes to Antony a dictum about how the spiritually accomplished cenobite is justified in leaving the cenobium in order to pursue the virtues by emulating virtuous hermits, wherever they may be found.90 Cassian's point has very little to do with Aldhelm's bizarre suggestion about Antony, but the juxtaposition of cenobitism and eremitism with regard to Antony is nevertheless closer in Cassian than in the Life of St Antony. Cassian's anecdote is far more in keeping with the consistent tradition about Antony's attitude toward the cenobia than is Aldhelm's fleeting remark. In any event, there is more evidence that Aldhelm knew Cassian's writings than that he knew the Life of St Antony. More interesting than these cases, though, are the instances where Aldhelm's treatment of the simile closely parallels the earlier writings of Jerome and Peter Chrysologus. Ehwald has noted Aldhelm's familiarity with a number of Jerome's exegetical works, his Lives of SS Hilarión, Malchus and Paul the Hermit, his Chronicon and his Letter to Eustochium.91 We have just considered that Aldhelm's vague account of Antony can be attributed to his reliance upon Jerome's De uiris inlustńbus. Since Aldhelm was evidently knowledgeable of a broad swathe of Jerome's writings, and since Aldhelm and Jerome are the only authors to draw the bee-imagery into a discussion of monastic obedience, it is undeniably possible that Aldhelm also knew Jerome's Letter to Rusticus. However, it must be acknowledged that Aldhelm's treatment of that theme is considerably more profound that Jerome's. Indeed, Jerome mentions it very briefly before passing on to other edifying pastimes that Rusticus might profit from undertaking. If Aldhelm was in fact inspired by Jerome's letter, he cer- tainly improved upon what he found there. As for Chrysologus's homilies, Ehwald did not detect any references to them in Aldhelm's works. Indeed, for clear evidence of Chrysologus's impact upon Anglo-Saxon authors, we must turn to /Elfric's Catholic homilies , written roughly two centuries after Aldhelm flourished.92 However, the striking parallel comparison of the church to the 89 Cf. Jerome, De uirìs inlustńbus , cc. lxxxvii- lxxxviii and cxxv (ed. E. Richardson, Texte und Untersuchungen 14(1)A (Leipzig, 1896), pp. 44-5 and 53). That this was available to Aldhelm in Canterbury is probable on the evidence from the Leiden glosses; see Hessels, Datin- Anglo- Saxon Glossary , pp. 27-9. 0 John Cassian, De institūti s V. iv. 1 -2 (ed.

Having now considered the sources at Aldhelm's disposal, we shall conclude this article with a few remarks on how Aldhelm handled this traditional theme. Two features are chiefly notable. The first is the shift in the bee simile that Aldhelm brings about, by stressing the intellectual culture of the nuns. This is not an entirely unprecedented feature of the tradition, but Aldhelm neverthe- less brings it about in a noteworthy way. By heavily stressing the exegetical skills of the nuns and especially by likening the nuns' intellects to bees, Aldhelm redirected a simile initially formed to praise ascetic work so that it could be used to praise intellectual work. His esteem for the nuns' intellectual prowess indicates Aldhelm's high valuation of literacy and the liberal arts. The second transformation of the simile is evident in Aldhelm's decision to use it in order to praise the social coherence of the nuns' life and their obedi- ence. We have seen that bees' social order is a widely attested perception among ancient authors. But, curiously, this aspect of secular literature was not adopted by the monastic authors who were otherwise so keen to appropriate the image of the bee. Even Jerome, who makes the first reference to bees' obe- dience within the context of discussing monastic life, has relatively little to say about the aptness of the simile. Once we read Aldhelm's strong claims about how bees exemplify monastic obedience, it seems like such an obvious remark that one feels mildly shocked that no one had noticed the parallel before. This is perhaps a mark of the brilliance which Aldhelm exhibited in his fascinating digression about bees: although it is in many respects highly original, the description has in the end a familiarity akin to inevitability.93 93 I undertook this study while working over Aldhelm's De uirginitate prosa for the Fontes Anglo- Saxonici register. I would like to express my gratitude to Dr Rosalind Love for encouraging me to pursue this line of enquiry. 22</page></plain_text>
