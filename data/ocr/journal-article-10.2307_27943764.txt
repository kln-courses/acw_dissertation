<plain_text><page sequence="1">MORDECAI M. KAPLAN'S SYNTHESIS OF JUDAISM AND AMERICAN REUGIOUS NATURAUSM Emanuel S. Goldsmith / Queens College of the City University of New York Mordecai M. Kaplan (1881-1983) is the most seminal voice in the evolution of American Judaism in the twentieth century. His influence is felt in every aspect of Jewish life-communal, cultural, educational, and religious. His thought has affected the institutional and ideological configurations of all groups within American Jewry-Reform, Orthodox, Conservative, Zionist, and secularist. While the Orthodox shun his writings like the plague and the Conservatives remain overtly hostile to his radical theology, much of what they do and say is in response to challenges posed in his essays and addresses.1 The Reform movement, while refusing to commit itself to religious naturalism and religious humanism, has been much more open to Kaplan's influence than have the other groupings. The repudiation of Reform's predominantly theological Pittsburgh Platform of 1885 and its replacement by the "Guiding Principles" of 1937, which included sociological and cultural perspectives, may be traced directly to the impact of articles that Kaplan published in the Menorah Journal in the 1920s and 1930s as well as to his magnum opus, Judaism as a Civilization (1934). Kaplan's influence on the rabbis and educators of the Conservative movement is the result of the more than a half-century in which he served as a professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. The ambivalent attitude of the institution to Kaplan was more than compensated for by the loyalty and adulation of generations of students. Recent liberal developments within Conservative Judaism, such as the ordination of women as rabbis, cannot be explained without reference to Kaplan's work. 1. Cf. Emanuel S.

With the founding of the Society for the Advancement of Judaism (1922) and the Reconstructionist magazine (1935), Kaplan's ideology began to provide the basis for a fourth Jewish religious denomination in America. Kaplan's fears of further fragmenting American Jewry actually hampered the growth of Reconstructionist Judaism until the 1960s when he finally realized that his hopes of eventually dominating the Conservative movement were illusory. The establishment of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Philadelphia in 1968 provided Reconstructionism with a vigorous new leadership which should gradually revitalize Kaplan's concepts of "transnaturar and "religio cultural" Judaism. While expressly formulated with the American environment in mind, Kaplan's ideology has enormous implications for Judaism throughout the world, and its influence is slowly penetrating other parts of the Jewish Diaspora as well as Israel.2 I. Religious modernism may be distinguished from traditionalism in that its point of departure in religious life is the contemporary scene and present-day religious experience rather than the dictates of authority and the religious experience of past generations. Religious modernists are eclectics, selecting out of the garnered treasures of their forbears only those that they see as relevant and significant for their community's life today. Only those aspects of tradition that can be reconciled with what they regard as true and valid in their general world-views and approaches to life will be incorporated into their religious conceptions. For them, it is modernity, despite its flaws and failings, that is the judge and test of tradition rather than the reverse.3 As a religious modernist, Mordecai M. Kaplan viewed Jewish religion as the product of history and evolution, as a dynamic process subject to continuous growth and development. A "religious naturalist" and "religious humanist," he saw the divine as immanent in universal human experience and therefore rejected the grounding of Jewish religion in the authoritarianism of past generations. Moreover, the Jewish religion was for him the product of the thought and experience of the Jewish people, and therefore all super naturalism had to be rejected. The Jewish tradition's claim to supernatural origin was entirely natural and understandable amid pre-modern cultural conditions. It was simply a way of noting awareness of supreme value and 2. Cf.

For modern Jews, however, Kaplan developed the concept of a Judaism without supernaturalism, a "transnaturar Judaism which envisaged God in the "organicity" of the cosmos and in the fulfillment of human nature and destiny, rather than in the suspension of the laws of nature.4 The primary issue for Kaplan was never merely the rejection of belief in God as a supernatural being but rather the rejection of authoritarianism and supernaturalism (which always seeks validation in authority) in every aspect of Jewish religious life and thought. Kaplan did not simply reject the supernatural God-idea. He also and most emphatically rejected the supernatural people-idea commonly known as chosenness and the super natural revelation-idea known as Torah min hashamaylm. For Kaplan, supernaturalism was a Pandora's box. If there was a supernatural God, a supernatural people, and a supernatural doctrine, humanity-let alone the Jewish people-was doomed because accommodation and mutual respect became impossible. If, on the other hand, there was a naturalistic, humanistic, or transnatural God (whom we experience in our efforts to control our impulses, better our lives, and improve our world), then there was hope because there could be tolerance, compromise, and mutual understanding between individuals and groups. Kaplan believed that nothing so threatened the future of humanity, generally, and of the Jewish people, in particular, than the dogmatism, chauvinism, fanaticism, and intolerance of supernatural religion. The Holocaust became for the Jewish people a particularly painful demonstration of the evils to which doctrines of chosenness, superiority, supernaturalism, and authoritarianism could be subject. Moreover, the religious establishment of the State of Israel, he believed, threatened the very survival of that country as a democratic republic at the same time that Orthodox intransigence in the Diaspora threatened the viability of any kind of multidimensional organized Jewish life there. Despite Kaplan's great influence on Reform and Conservative Judaism, they could never accept his basic approach because, although Reform rejects authoritarianism, both movements accept diluted forms of supernaturalism. Kaplan's Reconstructionism unequivocally rejected both authoritarianism and supernaturalism. It sought to have faith in democracy replace authoritarian ism, and religious naturalism (Kaplan's transnaturalism) and religious humanism (salvation in this world through the improvement of human character and conscience) replace supernaturalism. Kaplan's supporters viewed his position as consistent with the Judaism of the past because of its emphasis on the centrality of the Land of Israel and the primacy of Jewish peoplehood and because in Judaism God has always been seen primarily as the cosmic source of spiritual values and ethical purpose. 4. Cf. Mordecai M. Kaplan, The Future of the American Jew (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1949), p. 377.</page><page sequence="4">8 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy II. Morderai Kaplan's interpretation of Judaism may be viewed as a Jewish synthesis of the empirical approach to religion, pragmatic philosophy, and pluralistic process theology. This modernistic orientation to religion is characterized by openness and tentativeness. It begins with the question of what in the world may be pointed to as unambiguous manifestations of Divinity. It establishes the hypothesis that there is a creative process in the world which brings values into being, transforming humanity for the better and thus making human life worthwhile and holy.5 Kaplan's approach may also be viewed as a Jewish version of what has been termed the "religion of quest" or the "quest orientation" to religion. Complexity, doubt, and tentativeness are terms that have been utilized to describe the "religion of quest." An individual who approaches religion in this way surrenders the certainty of final answers without denying the importance of religious questions and without denying the religious dimension of human life. This orientation to religion is associated with a heightened love of humanity, tolerance, and sensitivity to others.6 Kaplan's approach may also be seen as a Jewish version of the "religion of maturity" described by such students of religion as Erich Fromm, Erwin Goodenough, Gordon Allport, and H. Richard Niebuhr. Eager search and passionate quest for meaning characterize religious maturity. Though tentative, mature religion evokes feelings of wonder and awe and encourages responsible behavior in all areas of life.7 The purpose of Jewish existence, for Kaplan, was not that the Jews survive as a relic of the past, but that they take the old biblical idea of the human being created in the likeness of God and apply it to communal human life, that they try to make themselves, in A.D. Gordon's brilliant expansion of a biblical phrase, "a People in the image of God." Kaplan always stressed that individuals with a sense of moral responsibility were not enough. If humanity was to survive, the total group had to order its life in accord with the dictates of conscience and to develop itself along the lines of active moral respon sibility. The unique quality of the Jewish religion was that it was "the only religion of mankind, which, from its very inception, has been based on the on going history of a people in its relation to mankind."8 The Jewish people, which had traditionally sought to make itself an instrument for the development of better human beings and a better world, now had to take that goal and spell it out in greater detail. It had to develop 5. Cf. Randolph C. Miller, The American Spirit in Theology (Philadelphia: Pilgrim Press, 1974), p. 25. 6. Cf. C. Daniel Batson and W.

Kaplan, The Purpose and Meaning of Jewish Existence (Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1964), p. 310.</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 11, No. 1 January, 1990 9 a kind of Jewish religion that would view God not as a supernatural being up in the sky but as that Power or Force in the universe, in nature, and in the human heart and mind, that impels us both to be ourselves and to be a part of something bigger than ourselves at one and the same time. God is the Power, Force, Process, or Energy by means of which people are motivated to exercise their rights, pursue their responsibilities, and strive to be at peace with themselves, with nature, and with other people. The idea that religious truth is derived from a realm beyond natural experience and that it has to remain unaffected by natural experience was to be rejected. Tor a religious tradition to become part of our personal experience nowadays, it has to possess the authenticity we associate with scientific fact. It has to convey the kind of literal meaning which we can integrate into our normal experience."8 No religious tradition could do that, said Kaplan, unless its supernaturalism was translated into naturalistic terms. That, however, was a small price to pay for the sense of historic continuity which confers meaning and zest upon a religious community. Kaplan believed that the Jewish tradition could without difficulty be translated into transnatural terminology and humanistic ex perience. According to Kaplan, it was the application of functionalism (which he sometimes referred to as functional rationalism) to Jewish experience that led to his discovery of "Judaism as not merely a system of religious beliefs and practices, but as the sum of all those manifestations of the Jewish People's will to live creatively," and to his redefinition of Judaism as an evolving religious civilization. From its earliest full formulation (in 1934), Kaplan's definition of Judaism has been revolutionary, challenging virtually all accepted definitions in vogue since the emancipation of Western Jewry in the nineteenth century, when questions such as "What is a Jew?" and "What is Judaism?" had first begun to be raised. It challenged both the original Reform concept of Judaism as only a religion of ethical monotheism and the Orthodox view of Judaism as a set of divine rules. Nor could it accept totally the Conservative concept of Judaism as a "positive-historical" religion. To Kaplan, Judaism was a civilization-dynamic and evolving, with religion as its core, but containing other integral elements such as language, secular history, music, art, literature, customs and folkways, and the concept of the Land. "To choose to remain a Jew," he wrote, "is a three dimensional affair. It involves choosing to belong to the Jewish People, to believe in Jewish religion, and to practice the Jewish way of life. In terms of contemporary philosophy, Judaism as an evolving religious civilization is existentially Jewish 9. Ibid., p. 307. 10. Mordecai M. Kaplan, The Religion of Ethical Nationhood (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1970), p. 4f.</page><page sequence="6">10 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy peoplehood, essentially Jewish religion, and functionally the Jewish way of life."11 Kaplan also disagreed with the methods that the various Jewish denominations were using to make Judaism viable in the modern world. He was as opposed to the Reform method of changing Jewish religion to suit the external pressures of the current culture as to the Orthodox method of unquestioningly preserving the traditions of the past, and to the Conservative approach of analyzing and explaining practices in order to preserve that past while assenting to change only when absolutely necessary. Kaplan sought to refashion the whole of Judaism to meet what he called the "spiritual needs" of the Jewish people, brought on by the rapidly expanding dimensions of modern science, philosophy, and political life in a global culture in which the Jewish people now participated. Kaplan also taught that as an organic civilization Judaism is not static; it has always been in a state of flux-developing, growing, changing. In opposition to the notion that what is static is authentic, and that what always remains the same should rightfully command our respect and allegiance, Kaplan's view was that only that which evolves and changes without losing its identity or continuity is authentic. He agreed with the statement of the seminal Jewish philosopher, Hermann Cohen, that "true progress depends on continuity in change, not on the preservation of dogmatic principles."12 Since Judaism was more than a religion, it could not be limited to a particular philosophy. In the past it welcomed, and today continues to harbor, different and even conflicting philosophies. This is so because Judaism involves the life of a whole people, with different individuals and groups embracing every conceivable viewpoint and approach to life. "The dogmatism that would rule out more than one absolutely true rationale for Jewish existence ignores the intellectual freedom which has come to be a sine qua non of being human. Jewish existence will henceforth have to be compatible with the inevitable variety of human minds."13 III. Kaplan began his work during the heyday of American religious liberalism which lasted from the turn of the century until the beginning of the Second World War. In addition to the growth of modern science, a major factor in the rise of liberalism was the development of modern historical and literary research of religion and the Bible. The religious liberals of the early twentieth 11. Kaplan, The Purpose and Meaning of Jewish Existence, p. 30. Kaplan's description of Judaism as a civilization may have been influenced by the popular American Protestant preacher and thinker David Swing. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, Swing utilized the term civilization to characterize Christianity. Cf. William R. Hutchinson, The Modernist Impulse in American Protestantism (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1976), p. 58. 12. Quoted in ibid., p. 148. 13.

They domesticated modern religious ideas and carried forward the "confrontation between traditional orthodoxies and the new grounds for religious skepticism exposed during the nineteenth century."14 American religious liberalism, in particular, was characterized by ethical passion and a preoccupation with religious experience. Its underlying motives were continuity or emphasis on the immanence rather than the transcendence of God, autonomy or the centrality of personal religious experience rather than the appeal to external authority, and dynamism or the stress on evolution in nature and history rather than the traditional appeal to static categories.15 While clearly within the broad stream of American religious liberalism, Kaplan, like his Protestant colleague Henry Nelson Wieman (1884-1975), was critical of certain liberal presuppositions. As modernistic liberals or radical modernizers, Kaplan and Wieman took scientific method, scholarly discipline, empirical fact, and prevailing forms of philosophy as their point of departure.16 Although aware of much in Judaism and Christianity that should be retained in modern times, they felt that their traditions had to be evaluated in the light of modern science, philosophy, psychology, and sociology. Nothing was to be adhered to unless its relevance could be made apparent.17 As modernists they advocated "the conscious, intended adaptation of religious ideas to modern culture."18 For them God was immanent in cultural evolution, and society was progressively moving toward realization of the Kingdom of God even if such a goal might never actually be attained.19 In the period under discussion, liberalism was represented in the Jewish community chiefly by the Reform movement. Reform taught that Judaism had attained the highest development of the God-idea and was therefore superior to all other religions. Kaplan felt that such a claim could not be substantiated by historical fact. Reform also stressed ethical commitment to the detriment of ritual practice. Kaplan chided it for having thus reduced Judaism to a philosophy of religion. In addition, Reform renounced Jewish nationalism and insisted that the Jews were merely a religious community. Kaplan accused it of thereby severing Judaism from the texture of Jewish experience and of failure to understand the full implications of religion and community. A community, according to him, was not merely a society. A community implied living in common as well as believing in common. The Reform movement, he contended, had failed to assimilate recent studies of the nature and history of religion, and its theology and sociology were hopelessly 14. Sidney E.

It had given free scope to intellectual inquiry without taking advantage of that freedom to understand the nature and purpose of religion and peoplehood.20 The main function of religion, as Kaplan saw it, was to enable a group to adjust to its environment and make the most of its life. 'The scientific spirit has invaded the entire domain of human thinking. Even theology is giving way to the science of religion to which it bears the same relation as alchemy to chemistry."21 Despite their reservations about religious liberalism, Kaplan and Wieman were, broadly speaking, members of the religious liberal camp. Kaplan, while concerned with the preservation of those elements of the Jewish past that had contemporary significance and with the integrity and continuity of Jewish civilization, also insisted on "the responsibility of the living generation to evaluate tradition and to reject what is not relevant to contemporary needs, or in accord with the best modern thought."22 Generally speaking, religious liberalism emphasized subjective belief and appealed to religious experience for evidence of God. This emphasis, however, frequently led to the denial of the objective reality of God. Along with their opposition to idealism and its tendency to objectify subjective human ideals, Wieman and Kaplan were also opposed to the extreme forms of humanism which deny all objective reality to the divine aspects of experience. Kaplan deemed the humanistic interpretation of life inadequate because of its failure to express or foster the feeling that our ethical aspirations are part of a cosmic urge. "Without the conviction that the world contains all that is necessary for human salvation, the assumptions necessary for ethical living remain cold hypotheses lacking all dynamic power."23 Spiritual religion differs from humanism in its assumption that the cosmos is in rapport with the human quest for fulfillment. It stresses the fact that "the universe is not only interrelated but divine, in that it is so constituted to help man in his striving after salvation."24 Despite these misgivings, however, Kaplan and Wieman are properly designated religious humanists since both accorded centrality in religion to the human need for salvation or transformation and both rejected supernaturalism. Kaplan belonged to that sector of American religious liberalism that embraced theistic or religious naturalism. He conceded that naturalism had formerly been incompatible with religion because it reduced all life and thought to operations of matter and physiochemical causes, and left no room for belief in the reality of God and spiritual values.25 In countering belief in a 20.

The type of naturalism that Kaplan espoused recognized qualitative distinctions between lower and higher orders of being. It allowed for creative or emergent evolution and for the autonomous functioning of mind and spirit. It conceived of truth, justice, and love as operating in their own right and helping to bring order out of chaos.26 Kaplan was also an empirical theologian who sought an anchor for religious faith independent of revelation and tradition and found it in the scientific methods of reason, observation, and experimentation. The empirical method in theology bases all claims to, and interpretations of, knowledge on personal experience. Such experience may, however, embrace all that has been "enjoyed and suffered." Empirical theology also insists on a method of religious inquiry that is accessible to all. "Recent empiricism," as James S. Martin, Jr., points out, "while retaining the notion that scientific knowledge must begin and end with public experience, has not conceived of such experience narrowly in terms of mere sensation and association. Affective, volitional, and valuational elements are seen to be parts of the whole. And the significance of experimentation, or experimentalism, as the most fruitful method for the exploration and organization of experience has been emphasized."27 For Kaplan, the effect of trying to preserve Jewish religion in its traditional form, without adequately reckoning with modern experience, was to make Jewish religion an anachronism in the modern world. Jewish religion had to be based "not on what our ancestors have told of their experience with God, but on our own experience with God."28 His study of the evolution of Jewish religion led him to realize that "although medieval Jewish theology believed it was merely reaffirming the Jew's allegiance to traditional beliefs, it indirectly paid sufficient homage to reason to prepare the way for a type of religion in which reason-in a sense sufficiently large to include our deeper insights and intuitions-is the only guide and authority."29 To Kaplan, any conception of God based on delusion partook of idolatry. Anti-intellectualism and irrationalism in the forms of romanticism and mysticism were to him distortions of truth and the sense of reality.30 Kaplan was a process theologian influenced by the thought of such philosophers as Henri Bergson, Samuel Alexander, C. Uoyd Morgan, John E. Boodin, George Herbert Mead, and Alfred North Whitehead. Process philosophy emphasizes both process or becoming and relations or relativity. 26. Ibid., p. 95. 27. James A.

Kaplan emphasized that modern scientific and philosophic thought views all of reality as dynamic and as energy in action. To speak of God as Process is "to select, out of the infinite processes in the universe, that complex of forces and relationships which makes for the highest fulfillment of man as a human being and identify it by the term 'God.1"32 IV. Kaplan also had a deep concern with the concept of value. Religion is actually concerned with value in two senses. It involves the choice, appreciation, and adoration of value or the source of value, and it posits a faith in the universe as hospitable to value.33 Kaplan placed the term "God" in the category of value which is related to wisdom rather than in the category of fact which is related to reason and intelligence. Values, he insisted, are actually as real as visible and tangible facts. "As psychic and social facts or realities, values are far more potent as fact makers or factors, in the sense of producing results. The God concept, properly understood as a factor in ordering the life of men and nations, is the most potent and creative factor in human existence."35 The approach of Kaplan was not only axiological or concerned with values, but also soteriological or concerned with salvation. As a theologian he helped to introduce concepts such as salvation, redemption, deliverance, transformation, and metamorphosis into empirical and process thought. To him, salvation is a this-worldly social as well as individual reality which must be understood in relation to human needs. Religion, according to Kaplan, is our conscious quest for salvation or the achievement of our human destiny.36 The proper task of religion is not to prove the existence of God but to assist people in their quest for self fulfillment or salvation.37 Salvation is "the achievement of such personality in the individual and of such society in the collective, as to augment the measure of integrity, responsibility and creativity in the world."38 It is the maximum fulfillment of those capacities which entitle people to be described as created 31.

It is the effort to improve oneself and one's environ ment and as such is prophetic of human destiny and a manifestation of the divine in human life. It is the capacity to play a conscious role in the evolution of self as well as the urge toward transformation and metamor phosis.41 The concept of salvation, according to Kaplan, is rooted in the objective psychological need to be needed which is experienced as the need to be accepted and loved. To be needed a person must be honest, creative, just, and ready to serve. Every person may be creative because insofar as one produces more than one consumes, one contributes to making life worthwhile for all.42 The need to be needed applies to nations as well as to individuals. To achieve salvation, human beings must strive for world peace, ethical nationhood, and individual happiness.43 For the individual, salvation also consists of the satisfaction of the three primary needs: health, love, and creativity. For society, salvation involves seeing that every person has the economic and cultural opportunities necessary for maximum self-fulfillment.44 The word "God" may become a device with which to conceal from oneself and from others the true character of one's faith.45 Kaplan sought to specify the distinguishing characteristics of God. To Kaplan, nature's God or Godhood is identical with the totality of creative processes in the human being and nature which make for self-transcendence and self-perfection.46 "Divinity is that aspect of the whole of nature, both in the universe and in man, which impels mankind to create a better and happier world and every individual to make the most of his own life."47 God is "the functioning in nature of the eternally creative process, which, by bringing order out of chaos and good out of evil, actuates man to self-fulfillment."48 Kaplan sought to divorce the God-idea from mythology, anthropomor phism, and supernaturalism, and identify it with "all human conduct that strives for the creative survival of the human species in a warless world."49 Since we can now understand the moral aspect of social existence which impels us to fulfill ourselves as human beings, we can freely reject the supernatural elements of traditional religion. We can find God in the urge to truth, 39. Kaplan, Questions Jews Ask, p. 126. 40. Ibid., p. 480. 41. Kaplan, "Religion in a New Key," 18. 42. Kaplan, The Religion of Ethical Nationhood, p. 49. 43.

"The theory of reciprocal responsibility is the conscious human manifestation of the principle whereby everything in nature is both cause and effect of everything else. It corresponds with the universal law of polarity whereby everything in the universe, from the minutest electron to the vastest star, is both self-active and interactive, independent and interdependent."53 'The cosmic process of universal reciprocity outside the human mind comes to be God only when it is experienced as cosmic interdependence, and, in the world, as moral responsibility."54 Human nature is an extension of cosmic processes while conscience, which dictates to us what we should do and induces remorse for failure, is actually the "semi-conscious intellectual effort to experience Divinity without recourse to anthropomorphic terms, rational propositions or mystic ecstasy."55 Kaplan stressed the significance of group or public religion as essentially an expression of response to human needs. Group religion is an aspect of wisdom or the concern with value and as such responds to the need to be needed. The need to be needed is identical with the need to transcend oneself or to experience the holiness of life. Transcendence or holiness is actually the human equivalent of what in nature is known as organicity or the process by which anything is more than the sum of its parts. God is the incremental plus of organic human society. "The process of organicity, functioning self-consciously in organic human societies is God, as the power that makes for salvation." The God of Israel "represents the power of 51. Morderai M. Kaplan, "Between Two Worlds," Varieties of Jewish Belief, ed. I. Eisenstein (New York: Reconstructionist Press, 1966), p. 141. 52.

It reflects awareness of the organicity of the universe and assumes that there is enough in the world to meet our needs but not enough to satiate our lusts and greeds.58 Historically, the term "god" denoted any value or good that answered a need. The unique God denotes the fulfillment of all human needs."56 Such fulfillment depends on the functioning of conscience and moral responsibility. Religion is not a response to an intellectual need but to the human need to be needed. It is not a matter of reflection but a matter of responsibility.60 The term "God" is not a substantive but a functional noun denoting something exceptional and therefore transcendental or transnatural. It denotes the experience of holiness, which is related to the functioning of conscience.61 Kaplan grappled significantly with the problem of evil. By denying the traditional conception of divine omnipotence, he was able to rescue divine beneficence without resorting to, and glorifying in, paradox. Kaplan spoke of evil as religion's worst ailment and the source of Its crisis in the modern world. Its attempt to understand evil intellectually and to resign people to it actually contributes to the worsening of the human situation. Religion is too preoccupied with justifying "God's ways" and preaching resignation instead of with actively seeking an end to exploitation and war. The various attempts to account for evil are erroneous because they derive from the incorrect notion that God is a being like us. For Kaplan, insofar as Godhood is the correlate of humanity's efforts to improve human life, God is a process. The creativity manifest in human responsibility, integrity, and loyalty or love constitutes the Godhood or divinity of the cosmos. This perspective shifts attention from metaphysical speculation to our inhumanity to one another.62 "If God, conceived as function, denotes whatever is of ultimate value to mankind, he cannot be represented as a personal Being infinite in power and goodness, which is a contradiction in terms."63 Theodicies which attempt to justify God's ways are meaningless and replete with inconsistencies. "Nature is infinite chaos, with all its evils forever being vanquished by creativity, which is God as infinite goodness... . The power of God is inexhaustible but not infinite."64 Kaplan's position was based on his analysis of the empirically 57. Mordecai M.

The function of conscience, the "pain of the human spirit," is not to promote speculation about God or reconcile humanity to human evil but to eliminate the causes of such evil and help bring about God's kingdom on earth. Conscience is hence also the revelation of God in the human spirit.65 V. Kaplan gave a great deal of thought to the practical aspects of religion and especially to religious education and worship. He spoke of the creative expansion of Torah based on a conception of this-woridly salvation. It would have to deal, from the standpoint of ethics and religion, "with all those higher needs of the human spirit which have come to be better understood by reason of the general advances in the knowledge of human nature."66 The primary purpose of education should be to get people to want only what they absolutely need physically, socially, and spiritually. As a lifelong process, Jewish education should deal with the subject of ecology and include topics such as the elimination of war, ethical nationhood, and individual freedom.67 Kaplan was disturbed by the fact that present-day organized Jewish life gives little encouragement to the consideration of religion from an intellectual point of view. It is therefore necessary to stimulate interest in such problems as are dealt with in theology and philosophy of religion, and to cultivate religion as an integral element in human culture.68 In order for Jewish education to be a source of self-fulfillment, it has to deal with the fact that the human mind evolves, as people's needs multiply and means are found to satisfy those needs. Religious traditions must therefore be transmitted not in their own terms but in terms that make them contemporary and subject to the process of conscious ongoing interpretation. Moreover, "the Jew as an individual must reckon with his individuality, with a sense of freedom which he must not renounce nor even play down. He must insist upon his right to do his own thinking and to refus? to be brainwashed."69 Jewish education should emphasize wisdom rather than faith since "the very nature of religion and God can be demonstrated as having greater validity in terms of human experience, instead of in terms of faith, which is experience by proxy."70 Kaplan believed that worship fulfills essential needs of human nature by affirming the meaning of life and the primacy of moral and spiritual values and by giving reality, purpose, and self-consciousness to the collective spirit of a people. It provides a glimpse into the unity, creativity, and worthwhileness of 65. Kaplan, "The Unresolved Problem of Evil," 15. 66. Kaplan, Questions Jews Ask, p. 389. 67. Mordecai M.

Worship, he felt, should be used to study God's laws in nature and in human life.73 Kaplan did not fail to apply his approach to the attitude of Judaism to other faiths. He wrote of the sancta of a people or church as the persons, events, texts, places, etc., through which it helps those who belong to it achieve salvation. The sancta of each people or church naturally mean more to its members than those of any other group. Whether the sancta of one group are more ethical or spiritual than the sancta of another group is beside the point. "The fact is that such comparison is not only odious but unwar ranted, because the sancta of no religion or civilization are so fixed or static as to be incapable of development and revaluation."74 Since every religion aspires to be a means of salvation to its own people or church, the assump tion that one's own religion is the only religion is obsolete. No religion can be absolutely more or less true than another. "Though, at some particular time or place, one religion may be more helpful to its own adherents than another religion is to the adherents of that religion, that condition may be reversed before long."75 Each religion exists in its own right and has no need to justify itself by asserting its superiority over other religions. "If a devout Christian tells me that he finds in the adoration of the personality of Jesus all the inspiration that he requires for living a life that satisfies his spiritual needs, I cannot as a Jew say this attitude is not true, although I am so conditioned that I could not possibly find it true in my own experience. On the other hand, If I say to him that I can find in the Torah literature of the Jew the reflection of an attitude toward life more satisfying than any I could find in the New Testament or elsewhere, I, too, am speaking the truth, and my religion is as true as his."76 Each religion exists in its own right and should not have to justify its existence by any assertion of superiority. Hence for Kaplan the future of interfaith goodwill depends on something other than tolerance between groups. The way to deal with diversity is for each faith to heed the voice of conscience and the dictates of moral responsibility, and to relate to other faiths in a spirit of openness and mutual respect. 71.

Morderai Kaplan's modernistic interpretation of Judaism constitutes a highly original synthesis of concerns and concepts responsive to the inner spiritual and cultural needs of the Jewish people in the period following the tragedy of the Holocaust and the rebirth of Jewish national sovereignty in the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people. He viewed antisupernaturalism as just as significant in the contemporary world as anti-idolatrism was in ancient Israel and anti-antrhopomorphism was in medieval Judaism. Most people ran no longer conceive of God as a being out there telling humanity what to do. But they do feel the need to conceive of God coursing throughout nature as well as inside their own hearts and minds, goading them to be and do their best and helping them overcome life's frustrations and tragedies. Similarly, the Jewish people's contribution to humanity must be sought not in its being superior to others but in its being itself. As Y.L Peretz, the distinguished Yiddish and Hebrew writer, put it: Judaism is simply seeing the world through Jewish eyes, i.e., from the perspective of universal unity and mutual responsibility.77 In Morderai Kaplan's view, the Torah (which for him meant the Five Books of Moses as well as the later classical works of Judaism) needed to be seen as products of the Jewish people's never-ending quest for purpose, meaning, and value, and, therefore, as in no way finished or complete. His view of Torah was inclusive rather than exclusive, and he spoke of its "creative expansion" to include the best products of Jewish culture and universal ethical teachings. Torah had to embrace all the worthwhile products of the Jewish spirit and of the universal spirit for the never-ending task of civilizing religions and peoples, and heightening the sensitivity of people everywhere to the higher needs and destiny of all living beings. Religio-culturalism or "Judaism as a civilization" meant to Morderai Kaplan that without Jewish culture-literature, history, art, music, drama, dance, customs, folkways, and folklore-there could be no Jewish religion that would emotionally affect Jews for the better. It meant, moreover, that through their culture, Jews could discover the God who makes life beautiful and meaningful. It meant that Jewish life had to be built primarily on the foundation of strong historical and cultural ties among Jews and only secondarily on ideology. It meant that cultural unity was possible among Jews today despite ideological diversity, that continuity was possible despite new growth and development. Modern Jewish culture has, in the main, been associated with formal secularism because organized Jewish religion considered it superfluous and godless. In the State of Israel today, cultural creativity flourishes primarily in the secularist rather than in the religious ramp. The same is true of the Diaspora where living Jewish culture is found primarily among the secularist 77. a. Emanuel S. Goldsmith, Titzkhok Leybush Peretz on His Sixtieth Yortsayt," Jewish Frontier (June-July 1975): 23.</page><page sequence="17">Voi 11, No. 1 January, 1990 21 advocates of Yiddish culture. Kaplan's Reconstructionism is the only movement that promises to reconcile modern Jewish culture with modern Jewish religion and Jewish secularism with the religious heritage of past generations. It can do so because it replaces Jewish law with the concept of folkways and emphasizes Jewish sancta as the indispensable, unchanging vehicles of an ever-changing, dynamic, quest-oriented religion. The primary mitzvah of Jewish peoplehood," wrote Kaplan, "is rebuilding the House and reconstituting the Household of Israel."78 Kaplan's Greater Zionism, which included the international recognition of the Jewish people as a transnational people and the establishment of "organic" or united-despite d'rversity Jewish communities the world over, sought to place Jewish group existence on an equal footing with Jewish religion. In his view, Jewish peoplehood could never be less significant than Jewish religion because Zionism or the eventual rebirth and reconstitution of the entire Jewish people as "a people in the image of God" has always been synonymous with the highest type of Jewish religion. The God of Israel meant to Kaplan "the power of salvation which the collective self-consciousness generates by means of its organic function,"79 the spirit of the Jewish people at its best-the Jewish people living true to its own character both in Israel and the Diaspora without exaggerated notions of self-grandeur or xenophobia. When Jews said "our God and god of our ancestors," Kaplan wanted them to mean the Universal Process making for world peace, ethical nationhood, and personal fulfillment: that aspect of the culture of past generations of the Jewish people in which modern Jews could perceive the seeds of Jewish spiritual growth in future generations. Such Jewish religion could never become self-worship because Jews were called upon to worship not themselves but the God in themselves and their ancestors, "Nature's God,"-the spirit of freedom, justice, truth, loyalty, and compassion in their own history and in all of human civilization. Rational religion encompasses a wide variety of approaches to religious truth from deism and naturalism to rationalistic supernaturalism. In its various forms, it constitutes an outgrowth of the Age of Enlightenment. Such religion fosters faith in the idea that the voice of universal reason and conscience is the voice of God. The attempt to discover universal elements in religion gave rise to types of religion that could come to terms with the new insights and new challenges of the natural and social sciences and philosophy. It is certainly true that "apart from this effort the religion of the West would be unable to elicit integrating commitment or to find vital points of contact with secularism and with the myths of other religions and cultures. . . . The eighteenth century's demand for the universal is the perennially valid intention of its myth of reason."80 Rejection of the goals of the Enlightenment leads to dogmatism and fanaticism. 78.

This may account for its failure to attract wider support. James L Adams attributes this one-sidedness to the Enlightenment's preference for the neoclassical mood. It may indeed be the result of an overriding concern with the clear and distinct ideas of reason and a failure to appreciate the depth and richness that only poetry and myth can convey. "Any natural religion that loses contact with the historical and the concrete substitutes ideas about religion for piety."81 Mordecai M. Kaplan's transnaturalist interpretation of Judaism espoused the Enlightenment's loyalty to universal reason but tempered it with the intimacy and mystery which only wholehearted recognition and embracing of the historical, evolutionary, and civilizational perspectives on Judaism make possible. Kaplan reminded us that Israel was the first people to discover the God of history. The actual revelation of God took place not amid the thunder and lightning on Mt. Sinai but in 'the still small voice' of Israel's sense of human history."82 That accounts for the incomparable impact which the God of Israel has had on the religions of humankind. Nor does Judaism fail to provide an outlet for the mystical leanings of human nature. The self identification of the individual Jew with his Jewish people is the source of the mystical element in the Jewish religion . . . identification with the Jewish people provides Jewish religion with the indispensable dimension of the mystical."83 History and community are central categories of Kaplan's transnaturalist approach to Judaism. "Jewish identity demands of the individual Jew that he so come to know the Jewish people, its entire history, its civilization, and its destiny as to experience the reality of its God. This God, YHWH, is that aspect of the Jewish people which renders it more than the sum of its individuals, past, present, and future, and gives meaning to all its virtues, sins, successes and failures."84 The vicissitudes of humanity, in general, and of the Jewish people, in particular, in the twentieth century tempered Mordecai Kaplan's faith in the ideology of the Enlightenment but did not shatter it. He attributed to the Enlightenment a new dynamic concept of reality and a transvaluation of values. With confidence in human ability to extend the boundaries of knowledge and experience had come faith in reason and progress. Despair was thus replaced by hope. Much had happened since the Enlightenment to dampen the human spirit and cast people into despair again. Anti-rationalism and supernaturalism were on the ascent. The decimation of European Jewry during the Second World War was for the Jewish people a particularly painful reminder of the evils that supernaturalist and irrationalist ideologies could engender. Many people continued to be victims of intellectual and spiritual 81. Ibid., p. 122. 82. Morderai M. Kaplan, tf Not Now, When? p. 22. 83. Morderai M.

Nevertheless, Mordecai Kaplan believed that reason and hope would make a comeback. Faith in progress as automatic would be replaced by the realization that progress must be rationally and spiritually willed. People would once again strive to make life in this world significant and worthwhile. That was the kind of future in which he hoped a place would be assumed for the Jewish people.85 85. Cf.
