<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEORGE STEINER'S AFTER BABEL1 By EDWARD ULLENDORFF In coming to talk about George Steiner's extraordinary tour de force,2 a work that was clearly designed to be a masterpiece and so narrowly and peculiarly falls short of that aim, I feel rather like an inverted Balaam,3 for unlike Balaam I came to bless and not to curse, to appreciate and not to disparage. And now I stand here, not without awe before so monumental an achievement, yet full of doubts, questions, uncertainty, even some distrust. Dr. Steiner, Extraordinary Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, and now-appropriately enough-also Professor of English and Comparative Literature in the University of Geneva, has written these 500 densely argued pages (' dense' in both its senses of 'close' and 'opaque') on language and translation, representing the distillation, at times, alas, the obfuscation and perplexity, of many years of deep thinking, remarkably wide reading, and genuine wrestling with problems that occupy the minds of linguists and philosophers, psychologists and historians, students of comparative literature and of translation as well as of specialists in many adjacent disciplines. The interdisciplinary approach and the wide cultural sweeps, with their pregnant epistemological implications, are full of stimulating observations and insights, the gropings (though I do not recollect Dr. Steiner ever using so tentative an expression) of a late twentieth-century polymath. But one's worries are aroused when the author speaks, with seemingly equal authority, about atomic physics, neurophysiology, molecular biology, mathematics, music, biochemistry, or art. I shall need to return to this point later on. The book examines-no, it never strictly does that, for it progresses laterally rather than lineally, less by argument than by quotation, by obiter dicta, learned apparatus, daring comparisons, startling contradictions, idiosyncratic formulations and modes of thought; by an expose of learning and learnedness rather than by pursuit of detailed scholarly examination, by flitting from one subject to another, by a marked penchant for generalities as distinct from specific and detailed study. By a combination of all these methods Dr. Steiner introduces us first to the problems associated with the mystery of the vast number of languages and the immense means of linguistic diversity and differentiation. This is the problem of Babel. He also deals (and this is, perhaps, one of the weakest and least satisfactory sections in the book) with the question of multilingualism in individual speakers; and here Dr. Steiner's own position looms large. More about this presently. 1 Text of a paper read to the British Association for Jewish Studies, meeting at Oxford on 21 July 1975. 2George Steiner : After Babel: aspects of language and translation. xi, 507 pp. London, etc.: Oxford University Press, 1975. ?8. 3Numbers xxii-xxiv. VOL. XXXIX. PART 2. 28</page><page sequence="2">404 EDWARD ULLENDORFF Translation is conceived of and discussed (at times with a most welcome wealth of examples) both as interlingual transfers of meaning from one language to another as well as the act of interpretation that occurs in the same language within one person as well as between speaker and auditor. Such a summary does, of course, scant justice to either the substance or the remarkable form of Dr. Steiner's cogitations, and it is for this reason that we shall wish to examine his propositions and theories in some detail. Few reviewers-and certainly not the present one-could claim to encompass the entire field traversed by the author. It may be a somewhat bizarrely untidy field, but of its vast extent and its distant horizons there can be no doubt. I shall, therefore, endeavour to confine myself to aspects of linguistics, to Hebrew and other Semitic languages, and to such features as fall within my professional competence-such as it is. But I must first dispose of one facet that has caused me much irritation, lest this vexation should intrude into what I have to say. Dr. Steiner has a curious addiction to a few vogue words which are truly flogged to death; among these ' kabbalistic ', ' hermetic ', ' neuro- physiological', 'hermeneutic', etc., are excessively prominent. Some of them are not always properly employed, and certainly 'kabbalistic ' often does duty for 'abstruse '-which it should not. This is at times coupled with technical jargon of great density and pseudo-modernity which ill consorts with old- fashioned Teutonic periods of profound opacity. At this point I should, perhaps, justify the choice of this paper and this book for this particular learned society. In the first place, Steiner's work represents a humanistic achievement of the widest relevance and applicability. Secondly, the author's own experience, his multilingualism, his espousal of translation and translatability, his cultural restlessness and somewhat aggressive defensiveness derive, perhaps, from the Jewish predicament. Associated with these traits is an astonishing aptitude for pilpul and pilpulistic interpretation. The occasional opaqueness of language, the pleasure taken in density of formula- tion as well as in Sch6ngeisterei are at times a trifle reminiscent of Martin Buber. In Ethiopian poetry there is a literary device called 'wax and gold' where these patent and latent semantic levels are meant to explain the ambiguities of the Ethiopian mind. At times one might almost be tempted-or provoked- to protest that Dr. Steiner has given us too much wax and not enough gold. But such thoughts are the product of an occasional irritation with the author's mannerisms and are not a fair reflection of the true worth of this book which in its entirety, though scarcely in its constituent parts, may well be a masterpiece. One further observation of a preliminary kind: I have on purpose eschewed, at any rate hitherto, reading any reviews of After Babel; this means that I know virtually nothing of the reception the book has so far had. The only exceptions are Donald Davie's perceptive and beautiful review in the TLS (31 January 1975) and Philip Howard's profile of the 'Marco Polo of culture' in the Times (31 March 1975), neither of which I could avoid seeing. To begin at the beginning: the dedication to Dr. Steiner's wife appears in</page><page sequence="3">GEORGE STEINER'S AFTER BABEL 405 an oddly transcribed Hebrew that is colloquial and is capable of bearing unfortunate literary associations. Its meaning 'there is no other; she is unique' goes rather badly with the last sentence of the acknowledgements. However, this is a quibble, perhaps influenced by Steiner's own taste for literalisms of this kind. Much more disturbing is the highly uninformative list of contents. The chapter headings tell us little or nothing, and they might all have been inter- changed amongst each other without loss. It would have been of real assistance to the reader if below the oracular headings detailed indications had been given about the contents of the many subsections. The structure of the book is difficult enough to understand, and such references would have helped us to appreciate the organization of an extremely complex book-one that is rightly described in the blurb as ' demanding '. The book is beautifully produced and is a real pleasure to handle. Having recently been compelled, on several occasions, to chide the Clarendon Press on its poor indexes, I am happy to say that the present index leaves nothing to be desired. The main bibliography is chronologically arranged, and the biblio- graphical data embodied in the footnotes are of the greatest value; they also testify to the prodigious range of Dr. Steiner's reading. An odd and uncharacteristic gap in the author's bibliographical equipment is the total absence of any references to James Barr's highly relevant work, be it his Semantics of Biblical language or his Biblical words for time. Acquain- tance with Barr's books-and Hebrew and the Old Testament play a not insignificant part in some sections of After Babel-would have saved Steiner from many a pitfall. Almost equally strange is the fact that the author of After Babel never subjects the aetiological legend of Babel to the minute and detailed analysis it deserves. Genesis xi is only just mentioned,4 but never properly discussed. That Hebrew was the original language of mankind until the time of the confusion of Babel was, of course, a widespread belief 5 (cf. Bereshith Rabba 18): the Targumn Yerushalmi (Gen. xi, 1) asserts quite simply nn ' xz r .ip 7r? a s nr v nrt. Talmud Sanhedrin 38 b, on the other hand, thinks that Adam spoke Aramaic, while Shabbath 12b finds that plva j*'i n,n *) ~ p Genesis xi, especially verses 6 and 7, reflects accurately the power derived from the possession of language, the strength conveyed by ready communica- tion, and the dire intellectual consequences to human society following upon linguistic profusion and confusion. The Lord said: ' They are one people, and they have all one language ... and now nothing will be withholden from them which they purpose to do. Let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech '. This explanation of the 4 See pp. 60 and 67; cf. Ullendorff in BJRL, XLIV, 2, 1962, 455 ff. 5 Steiner's remarks on p. 59 lack precision and adequate literary documentation. He is, however, right to refer to A. Borst's important Der Turmbau von Babel.</page><page sequence="4">406 EDWARD ULLENDORFF diversity of languages must have answered an ancient and no doubt persistent desire to understand the perplexing problem of the linguistic barriers dividing mankind. Dr. Steiner is right in saying that 'We do not yet know if the " deep structures " postulated by transformational-generative grammars are in fact substantive universals'. Yet he is surely a little quixotic in stating his 'con- viction ', in heavy italics (p. 285), that 'if they are, the immense diversities of languages as men have spoken and speak them can be interpreted as a direct rebellion against the undifferentiated constraints of biological universality'. And he goes on to opine: 'it is conceivable that we have misread the Babel myth. The tower did not mark the end of a blessed monism, of a universal language situation. The bewildering prodigality of tongues had long existed, and had materially complicated the enterprise of men. In trying to build the tower, the nations stumbled on the great secret: that true understanding is possible only when there is silence. They built silently, and there lay the danger to God'. This is a fine example of the Steiner pilpul and his love of paradox. To the extent that any general statement can be made about Steiner's book (and in many respects it is less a book, a work of conventional scholarship, than an encyclopaedia of ideas, an encyclopaedia in poetic disarray, not so much a treatise as a masterpiece of universal culture where coherence, relevance, and transparent organization are considered mere pedantry), it does, I believe, fall into two parts: chapters i-iv, occupying roughly three-fifths of the work, deal with the linguistic and philosophical aspects of language and translation, while the remaining two chapters are primarily, though by no means exclusively, devoted to an exemplification of translation, more often than not of English, French, and German. In order to understand and to review so amorphous a work (and amorphous- ness, unspecific shape, and lack of organization are the most obvious features of this book), I have had to compile an index of some of the main subjects treated, for references to these may occur anywhere in a work where the usual criteria of structuring are in abeyance. For the purposes of the present critical survey I have selected six or seven main heads under which I have subsumed some of Dr. Steiner's principal ideas. It will be well to commence with a concept that is central to Dr. Steiner's reasoning, i.e. his own multilingual situation and the linguistic and philosophical implications that derive from it. Autobiographical notions underlie a great many of his contentions. Steiner claims that' men and women who have in fact grown up in a multi- lingual condition will have something to contribute towards the problem of a universal base and a specific world-image' (p. 108). This point is asserted rather than argued, but I am aware of little hard evidence to support it. The author then states (p. 115): 'I have no recollection whatever of a first language. So far as I am aware, I possess equal currency in English, French, and German. What I can speak,</page><page sequence="5">GEORGE STEINER'S AFTER BABEL 407 write, or read of other languages has come later and retains a " feel " of con- scious acquisition. But I experience my first three tongues as perfectly equiva- lent centres of myself. I speak and I write them with indistinguishable ease. Tests made of my ability to perform rapid routine calculations in them have shown no significant variations of speed or accuracy. I dream with equal verbal density and linguistic-symbolic provocation in all three.... Attempts to locate a " first language " under hypnosis have failed'. It is not for me to dispute the 'perfect equivalence' which Dr. Steiner claims for his first three languages, but Professor Davie, in his gentle and delicate review in the TLS, has made the point that 'though we can accept without demur his contention that he is lexically, grammatically, and in deeper ways too, a native speaker of each of his three languages-French, German, English-I think a consideration of his career as a writer (also, I would guess, as a public speaker) would show that rhetorically one of his languages, British English, is not native to him'. I would imagine that Dr. Steiner's rejoinder to this can only be an emphatic 'touch' '. But there are two important reservations that need to be made with regard to his claim of 'perfect equivalence'. In the first place, as one whose own linguistic habituation is not so very different from that described by Steiner, I find it difficult to envisage equivalent, as opposed to comple- mentary, centres of early linguistic competence or performance. In the Whorfian sense, different languages direct their speakers towards different modes of thought, and there are always elements more readily, more easily, more naturally expressed in one language rather than another. Steiner himself alludes to this when he tells us (p. 116) that his mother would' start a sentence in one language and finish it in another. At home, conversations were inter- linguistic not only inside the same sentence or speech segment, but as between speakers '. Precisely-because it was ' easier ', it more readily occurred to one, to use a certain word or syntactical device in one language rather than another. The 'natural condition' was not only 'polyglot ', but it was instinctively indiscriminate and linguistically promiscuous. Much more important is the second question: what conclusions are we to draw from Dr. Steiner's multilingualism ? I seem to detect a suggestion on his part that this condition as such has markedly influenced his world-view and developed in him modes of perception different from the mentality of a unilingual speaker. I think I might be able to accept such a proposition if his native tongues had been a combination of, say, English, Chinese, and Navaho, but the symbiosis of such closely related linguistic structures as English, German, and French does not hold out much promise of providing interesting recognitions-except plenty of the usual interference phenomena which are helpful to the linguist but scarcely to the philosopher. Dr. Steiner further tells us that 'even these three "mother tongues " were only a part of the linguistic spectrum in my early life. Strong particles of Czech and Austrian-Yiddish continued active in my father's idiom. And beyond</page><page sequence="6">408 EDWARD ULLENDORFF these, like a familiar echo of a voice just out of hearing, lay Hebrew' (p. 116). As to Yiddish, one may surmise that this concerned individual and relatively isolated vocabulary entries only, while his references to Hebrew, evocatively phrased though they are, make little linguistic sense. There are no phylo- genetic linguistic memories, and he would have to learn Hebrew ab ovo just like the next man. That this was, in fact, the case, would appear to be borne out (and this is not meant in any spiteful sense) by what the author has to say about Hebrew in various parts of the book. Even more startling is his next observation: ' This polyglot matrix was far more than a hazard of private condition. It organized, it imprinted on my grasp of personal identity, the formidably complex, resourceful cast of feeling of Central European and Judaic humanism' (ibid.). Surely the 'polyglot matrix' did nothing of the kind; it was Dr. Steiner's upbringing, milieu, education, and indigenous gifts which brought about this consummation. A monoglot matrix would have achieved the same-given comparable con- ditions and native disposition. It seems to be well attested-and Freudian pun-dreams are a case in point-that some people have dreams revealing a manifest linguistic identity. I myself have to confess that my dreams are so pictorial and linguistically unspecific that I can only marvel at Dr. Steiner's ability of language 'feedback ' (p. 117). It would be interesting to know how common it is among multilingual speakers to identify their dream contents in the specific linguistic terms to which the author has attained. There is, however, one facet where Steiner's polyglot matrix has been eminently influential-and that is in the sphere of his style which is ponderous, repetitive, and immensely learned; but above all this vast tome is entirely free of the slightest touch of humour or lightness. The monolingual native speaker of current English-as Donald Davie has again so aptly said-will employ 'a terse pithiness, a dry or casual tone, and a conversational or colloquial vocabulary ', while in another language community ' earnestness is signalled ... by copiousness, by "hammering home " (i.e. saying one thing in different ways, many times over), by an excited or urgent tone, and by a vocabulary that darts or ranges all the way from the racy to the ornate and the proudly erudite '. To that extent, Donald Davie finds, ' Steiner is still in this book using a foreign rhetoric .... True he has dried out of his style the effects of restless and lurid chiaroscuro ... but he is still an eloquent, ornate and driving writer, above all a copious one'. Nothing more charitable has ever been said. The idea that, according to the Kabbalah (p. 124), God created Adam with the word emeth 'truth' on his forehead and that removal of the initial aleph, embodying God and the mystery of the speech-act, leaves the universe meth ' dead' has for Steiner great symbolic significance, for 'what we can say best of language, as of death, is, in a certain sense, a truth just out of reach'. At such points I find it very difficult to accept Donald Davie's charitable assump- tion that Steiner is entirely in earnest.</page><page sequence="7">GEORGE STEINER'S AFTER BABEL 409 In musing about the grammatical and philosophical notions of futurity, the author recalls the shock he experienced 'as a young child when I first realized that statements could be made about the future, and that these were, in some sense, licit. I remember a moment by an open window when the thought that I was standing in an ordinary place and " now " and could say sentences about the weather and those trees fifty years on, filled me with a sense of physical awe. Future tenses, future subjunctives in particular, seemed to me possessed of a literal magic force ' (p. 139). ' I can recall the queer inner blow I experienced when learning, as a boy, that the future thermodynamics of the sun would inevitably consume neighbouring planets and the works of Shakespeare, Newton, and Beethoven with them ' (p. 155). What a precocious ' young child ' Dr. Steiner must have been ! But I still do not believe that this precocity was conditioned by his 'polyglot matrix '. I would surmise that he would have penned the same sentences even if French or German alone had been his native tongue. Or again: 'Thus one of the "languages" inside me, probably the richest, is an eclectic cross-weave whose patterns are unique to myself, though the fabric is quite palpably drawn from the public means and rule-governed realities of English, French, German, and Italian. Moving " between " languages, more- over, in what I obscurely apprehend as a complex, highly energized zone of modulation and indeterminacy, I register contiguities, correspondences, short- cuts which are based not only on speech-sounds, on patterns of meaning, on associations particular to my own life, but on word-shapes and tactile values' (p. 292). Apart from the poetic and rather obscure meaning of these autobiographical reflections, it seems to me clear that in the multilingual and intra-lingual maelstrom in which Dr. Steiner finds himself so perilously, yet so pleasurably, engulfed he is far too concerned with individual semantic units, vocables, that carry meanings and associations for him. What really matters for the sinews of language are the syntactical modes of expression, and it is a pity that nothing significant has been said about these in this book. From his vantage point of multilinguality it would have been most valuable if Steiner had given us some idea of the syntactical tensions of interference, their consequences and implica- tions, for this alone will tell us how the deep and surface structures of language are poised and balanced. I must now turn to Steiner's preoccupation with Hebrew, the Bible, and other Semitic languages. If, in the nature of things, these remarks concentrate on critical points, on areas of disagreement, I should wish it to be known that there are many more regions of vigorous assent as well as sincere admiration of the width of Dr. Steiner's reading, his interests and sympathies. I am puzzled when we are told (p. 22) that 'the grammar of the Prophets in Isaiah enacts a profound metaphysical scandal-the enforcement of the future tense, the extension of language over time'. This sentence comes out of the</page><page sequence="8">410 EDWARD ULLENDORFF blue and follows one on Aeschylus as a tragedian. But the ensuing sentence may possibly throw some light on this intriguing obscurity: 'A reverse dis- covery animates Thucydides; his was the explicit realization that the past is a language-construct, that the past tense of the verb is the sole guarantor of history'. However, to the extent that I am able to comprehend this latter sentence, I agree with the implications of the former even less. The Hebrew prophets were no soothsayers or forecasters but announcers (nabi) of God's will who spoke by divine inspiration. Their grammatical equipment differs in no way from that of other parts of the Hebrew Bible. And to what extent, if any, we are able to correlate the Hebrew tense system, as far as we can penetrate it, with extra-linguistic phenomena remains a moot point. Dr. Steiner is prone to generalizations, some of which are uttered in a throw- away manner that all but conceals their inaccuracy. Thus he avers that 'the absence of jokes from Old Testament writings suggests that purely verbal wit may be a fairly late, subversive development' (p. 22). In fact, however, puns are fairly common in the Old Testament,6 while humour, wit, satire, and irony are all well represented. One need only think of Yotham's exquisite parable of the bramble (Judges ix) or Samson's Eulenspiegel-like antics (Judges xiii-xvi) or of Esther's suggestion that Haman should act as herald before Mordecai the Jew. What could be wittier than Elijah's mocking of the prophets of Baal that they should waken their god if by chance he was asleep or possibly away on a journey (1 Kings xviii, 27). There are passages full of subtle satire in prophetic literature; one will at once be reminded of Isaiah's fable of the man who fashions his own god (Isa. xliv, 14-18) or of the coquetry of the women of Zion (Isa. iii, 16-24). Dr. Steiner asks (p. 23): 'Why did certain languages effect a lasting grip on reality ? Did Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Chinese (in a way that may also relate to the history of writing) have distinctive resources ? Or are we, in fact, asking about the history of particular civilizations, a history reflected in and energized by language in ways so diverse and interdependent that we cannot give a credible answer ? I suspect that the receptivity of a given language to metaphor is a crucial factor '. I think the answer must be somewhat as follows: Aramaic surely is the odd one out, for I cannot think of any truly great literature transmitted in that language. Since every language, almost by definition, has 'distinctive resources ', we must clearly assume that extra-linguistic factors are at work here. I myself do not know of any language which as such has a particular receptivity to metaphor. The linguistic means are either there or will be fashioned when the need arises. This answer is circular only if it is postulated that the linguistic framework creates the mental and intellectual conditions conducive to such a literary and cultural development. I think we possess adequate proof to 6 See T. H. Gaster, Myth, legend, and custom in the Old Testament, New York, 1969, 308 ff. and 657 ff.</page><page sequence="9">GEORGE STEINER'S AFTER BABEL 411 refuse to believe this: Ugaritic, a Semitic language closely akin to Hebrew, produced a vigorous poetic literature of a type well represented in the Hebrew Bible. That the carriers of that language and literature did not and could not vie with the Hebrews in their religious and cultural contribution to mankind is not due to any deficiencies or shortcomings inherent in their language. According to Steiner, ' eros and language mesh at every point ' (p. 38), and he considers this 'one of the most important yet least understood areas of biological and social existence '. In support of this contention he quotes ethno- linguists as reporting the existence of' a number of languages in which men and women use different grammatical forms and partially distinct vocabularies' (p. 40). The former fact is, of course, known to the author from his experience of Hebrew and Aramaic, while the latter is attested in a number of Semitic languages. Try as I might, I cannot help thinking that some of Dr. Steiner's observa- tions on ' eros and language' are forced in the extreme-not to say absurd. One or two examples: 'Intercourse and discourse, copula and copulation, are sub-classes of the dominant fact of communication .... Sex is a profoundly semantic act .... The seminal and the semantic functions (is there, ultimately, an etymological link ?) 7 determine the genetic and social structure of human experience. Together they construe the grammar of being .... If coition can be schematized as dialogue, masturbation seems to be correlative with the pulse of monologue .... Ejaculation is at once a physiological and a linguistic concept .... Semen, excreta, and words are communicative products .... At a rough guess, women's speech is richer than men's in those shadings of desire and futurity known in Greek and Sanskrit as optative ...' (pp. 38-41). Passages of this kind make one think that Dr. Steiner is having us on, but I do not really believe that he is teasing. I can find very little evidence for the author's proposition (p. 60) that 'Jewish thought has played a pronounced role in linguistic mystique, scholar- ship, and philosophy' and even less for the contention that 'in Jewish hermeneutics we find those rubrics that will largely organize the main directions of Western argument about the essence and enigmatic dismemberment of human tongues '. Most Hebrew thinking on this subject emanates from Arabic models, and the contribution of medieval Jewish commentators is of a Midrashic rather than scholarly nature. Dr. Steiner speaks of' medieval Hasidism ' (p. 61), but this must be a case of bonus dormitat Homerus, for he is, of course, aware that Hasidism did not come into being till the eighteenth century. And Eloh, instead of Eloah, is simply a lapsus calami (ibidem). To assert that 'each language is an " epiphany " or articulate revelation of a specific historical-cultural landscape ' (p. 76) is, on the one hand, much too SEven the use of 'ultimately' cannot make this an acceptable proposition: it would be hard to connect arjpalvw 'to make signs' with semen, verb sero 'to sow', which might well have to be placed with the Semitic zr'.</page><page sequence="10">412 EDWARD ULLENDORFF poetically vague and, on the other, suggests or even assumes a correlation of linguistic and extra-linguistic phenomena that remains to be demonstrated. Dr. Steiner's immediately following sentence, intended to provide evidence for this proposition, goes in fact a long way to disprove his point. He says: 'Hebrew verb forms are inseparable from the niceties and strict punctualities that mark Jewish ritual'. I have considered long and anxiously what this sentence could possibly connote, but I find myself utterly defeated. Further- more, since many of those 'niceties and strict punctualities' are couched in Aramaic, I wonder whether Aramaic verb forms are seen to possess the same properties ? After Babel contains a valuable, if somewhat desultory, discussion of grammatical and semantic universals. Among the latter are said to be certain 'key anthropomorphic metaphors' allegedly possessed by 'all languages'. One of these, Dr. Steiner tells us, 'has been traced in all Indo-European languages, but also in Swahili, Lapp, Chinese, and Samoan' (p. 102). The reference here is to ' the comparison of the pupil of the eye to a small child (pupilla) ', and it is a little odd that, with his great interest in Hebrew, Steiner should have failed to include Hebrew within this category, especially in view of the rather striking prrs and 7p, ny . Both Steiner and Chomsky (who is quoted 9 in some detail) appear to attach particular importance to lexical items in the transference of conceptual content. I would have thought that greatly disparate morphological and syntactical means constituted a limiting factor of a much more serious nature. In a translation from Amharic into English of Emperor Haile Sellassie's autobiography, on which I had recently been engaged, I found that the widely divergent syntactical means employed by the two languages presented at times very grave obstacles to a purposeful transference of thought--of a calibre totally removed from the occasional incongruities of lexical items. While many languages embody time and gender distinctions within the morphology of the verb, it needs to be emphasized that many others do not. We should be well advised to recall this when faced with Dr. Steiner's dictum that 'an entire anthropology of sexual equality before and in time is implicit in the fact that our [Indo-European] verbs, in distinction from those of Semitic tongues, do not indicate the gender of the agent' (pp. 131-2).10 In the first place, this is by no means universally true in Semitic: it does not apply to the first persons singular or plural, and is frequently absent, notably in Hebrew, in the third person plural. Secondly, in Arabic, Hebrew, and Ethiopic the refine- ments of those classical distinctions have gradually worn away, and in some modern Ethiopian languages they have all but disappeared. Yet, comparison 8 Cf. J. Barth, Nominalbildung, Leipzig, 1889, ? 212, c. * I am unable to trace the quotation alleged to derive from Chomsky's Aspects of the theory of syntax, 121-2. 10 Professor R. H. Robins has been kind enough to remind me that Indo-European participial clauses do indicate gender, especially the ancient IE languages.</page><page sequence="11">GEORGE STEINER'S AFTER BABEL 413 of the situation in classical times and now, or of those languages which have maintained gender distinctions with others that have not, will scarcely permit us to establish different anthropologies of sexual equality. The truth is, alas, that we are (as yet) unable to draw safe ethnolinguistic inferences. 'The relationship between linguistic expression and extra-linguistic situation is a slippery slope; it is tempting and alluring, and he who ventures upon it is in peril of his academic health' (Ullendorff, The challenge of Amharic, London, 1965, 22). When Dr. Steiner pronounces on Hebrew and the text of the Old Testament, one is at times tempted to wish, I trust not too unkindly, that he had stuck to his lasts. He starts out by declaring that 'futures play a major role in the "tenseless " syntax of Old Testament Hebrew' (p. 146) and then takes us, under the guidance of Martin Buber's writings, from Deuteronomic to Prophetic literature. I yield to few in my admiration for my erstwhile teacher Martin Buber, but to have Buber explained by Steiner is a classic case of obscurum per obscurius. It is not from love of alliteration that one wishes the author had studied Barr rather than Buber, for what is needed in this domain is precision rather than the ' prophet's prediction ', discipline rather than ' divine dialogue '. His mythical' futures' and ' tenseless ' Old Testament syntax are curiously tied to some proof-texts, such as Deuteronomy xviii, 10 or Leviticus xix, 26 where the verb pw is rendered as 'observer of times' on the basis of the AV, but neither the Hebrew text nor its commentators, including the NEB, would support such a translation-and certainly not the far-reaching extra-linguistic implications Steiner invites us to accept. I have said before that nabi and the future tense are entirely unrelated in Hebrew. I am quite unable to recognize the 'deep shift' that is alleged to begin in Isaiah with the word teudah. The suggestion that in Isaiah xi (where the word teudah does not occur) we should discern a move from prophecy to eschatology is linked to the observation that 'henceforth the optative, future indefinite character of the Messianic promise is stressed' (p. 147). Whatever else this notion may be based on, it cannot be criteria of a linguistic nature. In the same context I fail to grasp the relevance of Jeremiah's role as a bachun (Jer. vi, 27), rendered as 'watchtower' by Dr. Steiner, instead of the NEB's ' assayer' or Baumgartner's ' Metallpriifer '. It seems to me quite impossible to relate any of these theological-eschatological inferences to grammar or language, even in the widest and most generously interpreted sense. To aver that ' now human grammar interacts directly, creatively with the mystery of God's speech ' (p. 147) or that ' in ancient Judaism man's freedom is inherent in a complex logical-grammatical category of reversibility ' (p. 148) are statements of faith, not of linguistic scholarship. I do not pretend to grasp these arcane pronouncements or to know what a student of Hebrew or Greek is to make of the thesis that ' the conditional futures of Hebrew prophecy contrast sharply with what one might call the ambiguous fatalities of a Greek oracle '. A great deal could be said about Dr. Steiner's views on time, especially as</page><page sequence="12">414 EDWARD ULLENDORFF far as the temporal notions of Hebrew and Greek are concerned (pp. 151-9). He is inclined to rely here on the work of von Dobschiitz (p. 151) and of Boman (p. 157). But those treatises have already been subjected to the most com- petent critical scrutiny by James Barr (Biblical words for time, second ed., esp. pp. 144-5). Of the greatest importance here are also A. Momigliano's magisterial remarks in his 'Time in ancient historiography' (Beiheft vi to History and Theory, 1966). In this area Dr. Steiner has certainly been reading the wrong books. But he is also asking the wrong questions: 'Has the notion of a thermal death of the universe ... affected the psychological tenor and linguistic con- ventions of uses of the future tense ? ' (p. 155). Is this a meaningful question which a student of either language or philosophy is capable of comprehending- let alone answering ? It may well be true that 'the shapes of time are entrenched in grammar' (p. 156), but Dr. Steiner is right in perceiving that 'the difficulty arises when we ask whether and to what degree actual linguistic practice determines or is determined by underlying time-schemes '. The first prerequisite for resolving this conundrum is an accurate assessment of the organization of tenses in the language concerned; and to my knowledge, there are relatively few languages of which this can be said to have been accomplished with any assurance. As far as the Hebrew verb is concerned, Steiner is not correct in claiming that there has been no development 'to express the linear flow of time from past to future '. There has been a good deal of evolution in Mishnaic, medieval, and modern Hebrew. And simply because there is thus no one or uniform syntax of Hebrew, one must look askance at Steiner's arresting statement of belief that 'Hebrew syntax informs and is equally informed by the sovereign tautologies of the axiom of an immeasurable, inconceivable yet omnipresent God' (p. 158). It is thus a relief to put much of this high-flown rhetoric aside and follow Dr. Steiner in what he has to say in the area of his principal concern of literature where we find some passages of beautiful simplicity, free of all the bewildering copiousness of style, and where some important recognitions can be detected. Thus he speaks of 'the innocent finality of Hebrew poetry and of Greek literature' in which ' the paradox of freshness combined with ripeness of form .... No Western idiom after the Psalms and Homer has found the world so new' (p. 186). I now turn to Dr. Steiner's treatment of some general linguistic questions. He gives us an interesting and not uncharacteristic outline of the evolution of 'rational linguistic study' (pp. 73 ff.). In this historical survey he is fully justified in assigning a place of special honour to Wilhelm von Humboldt with whose work we ' enter on an entirely different order of intellectual achievement ' (p. 79). This seems to me a judgement that is completely borne out by the subsequent development of linguistic thought. In this connexion Steiner gives us a short list of thinkers on language-apart from Humboldt-' who have said anything that is new and comprehensive'. This list includes Plato, Vico,</page><page sequence="13">GEORGE STEINER'S AFTER BABEL 415 Coleridge, Saussure, Roman Jakobson. This assessment certainly has the authentic Steiner touch. Very few others would have thought of including Coleridge in this particular list, and there may well be argument about Vico's appearance in this company. Others might have added Trubetzkoy or, perhaps, even Whorf. It is, incidentally, very odd that two prominent names are omitted altogether from Dr. Steiner's rehearsal of linguistic developments. The first, W. Wundt, was a man of whom Steiner would surely have approved. He stands somewhat half-way between Humboldt and Whorf, in both chrono- logical and intellectual respects. His Volkerpsychologie was a highly influential work. The second, H. Paul, was more narrowly based, but his Principien der Sprachgeschichte remained for long a basic tool used by several generations of scholars. To revert to Humboldt: I have found Dr. Steiner's sketch of this great thinker one of the most helpful and indeed inspired passages in his book. Oddly enough, there are one or two German phrases here where my under- standing and rendering would slightly differ from Steiner's-a vivid example of the predicament of Babel. Humboldt's Uber die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues is translated by Steiner as ' differentiation ' rather than ' diversity '. I mention this example not for reasons of pedantry but because it lends additional support to the well-known, if inadequately documented, phenomenon that multilingual speakers, who are so natively, make rather poor translators. It is good to see Dr. Steiner coming to the rescue of one of Humboldt's most genuine and most distinguished successors, Benjamin Lee Whorf, who has incurred the obloquy of current fashions in linguistics (pp. 88 ff.). His post- humously published work does indeed exhibit 'extraordinary intellectual elegance'. Whorf's principal thesis that different languages cut up the world of reality in different ways, so that disparate tongues are likely to be expressive of disparate world-views, was supported by a great deal of his own work in the field of American Indian languages. It is, perhaps, a pity that there has been no comparable endeavour outside that field, either to confirm or to disprove. The difficulty is, of course (assuming that Whorf's basic notions are broadly accurate), to penetrate into the modes of thought of a different linguistic framework and to deduce from it the modus operandi of its mental categories. Steiner's question ' if the Humboldt-Sapir-Whorf hypothesis were right ... how then could we communicate interlingually ? ' (p. 94) might be answered in a threefold manner: (a) much depends on the distance between the languages concerned; (b) the level of discourse will determine the degree of inter-linguistic and inter-cultural penetration and will vary accordingly; (c) for adequate day-to-day communication a rough conversion of gross features is usually sufficient; the problems are likely to arise over minutiae only, and their accurate identification as such will present great difficulty.1 11I have not so far seen H. Gipper's Gibt es ein sprachliches Relativitdtsprinzip?, to which Professor Robins has very kindly drawn my attention.</page><page sequence="14">416 EDWARD ULLENDORFF While Steiner thus sympathizes with Whorf and his views, he maintains important reservations vis-a-vis Chomsky and his school. Some of these reservations seem to me entirely justified and deserve credit in the prevailing climate of well-nigh total absorption in Chomskyan linguistics, while others appear less cogently argued or even insufficiently expressive of the totality of the Chomsky codex. However, Chomsky and his disciples are well able to take care of themselves. I am concerned to raise the question of how Steiner can both support Whorf and at the same time make the universalist, Chomskyan, statement that 'there are principles of unity, of invariance, of organized form, which determine the specific genius of[all] human speech ' (p. 94). Like Whorf's mentalistic relativity, this assertion of universal notions remains in need of proof and support from a much wider range of languages than have hitherto been examined with these ends in view.12 The claim that 'today, the working vision of a universal grammar is shared by almost all linguists' (ibid.) may be statistically true, but it is a vision that is as yet unsupported by hard evidence-or else only by such banalities as the fact that all human languages operate by means of sounds emitted from the larynx and that by and large the sound : meaning relationship is arbitrary. Several of the universals adduced by Steiner (pp. 97-8) cannot be accepted as such simpliciter. I am not even absolutely certain that it is quite safe to assert that ' all speech operates with subject-verb-object combinations' (ibid.). I would certainly have grave misgivings over the statement that' the sequences " verb-object-subject ", " object-subject-verb ", and " object-verb-subject " are exceedingly rare'. Latin can do all three; in German you can say ' es fiirchten dich alle '; and I can think of a few more ' exotic' languages where some of these sequences cause no horror. For this reason I find Steiner's conclusion that these combinations are 'so rare, as to suggest an almost deliberate violation of a deep-rooted ordering of perception ' (ibid.) unsupported by the linguistic evidence. To the present reviewer there is much in Chomskyan linguistics that is of value and great usefulness. There is also no doubt that the patient quest for linguistic universals is of absorbing interest, but Chomsky's dictum that ' the main task of linguistic theory must be to develop an account of linguistic universals .. .' 13 (p. 95) seems to connote a prescriptive and Procrustean rigour that is wholly alien to free and unfettered inquiry. The main task of linguistics is to understand how language works and how languages operate; that a correct assessment of universals would greatly assist that undertaking is beyond question. It is a major concern-not the ' main task '.14 12 Elsewhere Steiner quotes with approval Roman Jakobson's observation that Chomsky's epigones 'often know only one language-English-and they draw all their examples from it' (p. 234). And Steiner himself raises the question : ' Might it be that the transformational genera- tive method is forcing all languages into the mould of English, as much 17th century grammar endeavoured to enclose all speech within the framework of classical Latin ? ' (p. 106). 1S Aspect8 of the theory of syntax, 27-8. 14 On pp. 98-100 Steiner has some highly pertinent observations on these points. See also</page><page sequence="15">GEORGE STEINER'S AFTER BABEL 417 Steiner thinks that 'in the light of anatomical and neurophysiological [his favourite expression] universals, a unitary language solution would be readily understandable ' (p. 50). I do not quite follow this mode of reasoning. In the first place, it suggests that physical and mental categories must be directly interchangeable. Secondly, since the anatomical endowment of all humans is very similar, it would be surprising if some did not possess the faculty of speech, but what they do with that faculty, in detail, is no longer a function of equivalent physical equipment. People can also be distinguished and recognized by their distinctive gait, though they are all equally endowed with a pair of legs. Thirdly, I am unable to judge how closely fitting the so-called anatomical and neurophysiological universals are. If there were a margin of latitude and tolerance, that might be considered vaguely analogous to the language differentiation. Finally, since variegation within speakers of the same speech community can be quite marked, it is scarcely surprising that that should be a fortiori the case in the interlingual situation when languages have evolved to the point of mutual unintelligibility. On a somewhat less exalted level, Steiner's book has a few lapses of a more mundane nature, such as 'every linguistic particle above the level of the phoneme is context-bound' (p. 113), but the phoneme, as the minimal sound- unit relevant to meaning, is context-bound by definition. In contrast to such oddities, we also encounter some finely observed assessments which merit quotation: 'If we except the Moscow and Prague language-circles, with their explicit association with contemporary poets and literature in progress, it can fairly be said that many modern analytic linguists are no great friends to language. Not many, and this applies particularly to the American school of " mathematical linguistics ", have inhabited the husk of more than one speech. Linguistic cross-reference, at any but the severest level of structural universality, recalls to them the discredited habits of nineteenth-century vergleichende Philologie' (p. 122). As one might expect of Dr. Steiner, he has many illuminating things to say on the subject of translation and translatability. And there are many examples, such as 'it looks like rain '-le temps est a la pluie (pp. 304 if.), which are thought-provoking. Alas, others-such as the tedious discussion of 'let there be light ' in Genesis i, 3-shed little light (no pun intended) on the subject and are accompanied by those turgid metaphysical summaries which so unneces- sarily disfigure some of Dr. Steiner's best pages. Apropos of this passage in Genesis we are told: 'The syntax of the Deity and of accomplishment make for an effect of balance, of equation rather than of tautological majesty. The definite article posits conceptual essence before phenomenality. Que la lumiere soit has an " intellectuality " altogether lacking from either the blank imperative of Fiat lux or the unforced immediacy of" Let there be light " ' (p. 307). Is the present reviewer the only reader who is puzzled ? pp. 106-7. On the other hand, S.'s objections to Chomsky, as set out on pp. 464-5, do not seem to me to amount to a serious assault on the Chomsky bastion.</page><page sequence="16">418 EDWARD ULLENDORFF But then again we meet passages of great translucence as we do in the discussion on the appropriate level of equivalence in the target language (pp. 341 ff.), on the degree of archaicism, the question of linguistic ' distancing ' in translation, historical stylization, idiomatic suitability, etc. In relation to T. E. Lawrence's rendering of the Odyssey, Dr. Steiner has this to say: 'It is not physical immediacy that Lawrence achieves but a farrago of Victorian Orientalism in the manner of Doughty, of Biblical pastiche, and scout-master heroics' (p. 343). This is strong stuff, but it is probably not exceedingly unjust. Entirely new to me was the fascinating story of Rudolf Borchardt creating a new German idiom in which to clothe his rendering of Dante (pp. 338 ff.), a form of Friihneuhochdeutsch, called by him Dante Deutsch, for which he fashioned or adapted words as well as grammatical devices. I have already previously referred to the problems of translatability and have expressed my conviction that marked disparity in syntactical means can be a much graver handicap to translation than insufficient congruence in lexical slots. I therefore find myself in agreement with Dr. Steiner's statement that 'it is logically conceivable that a translator, having gained great mastery over a source-language will conclude " I understand this text but find no way of restating it in my own native tongue " ' (p. 353). This is a feeling to which many of us have come very close when translating from languages whose epistemological referents made conversion into thought categories readily accessible to us exceedingly complicated. However, such problems may quite genuinely occur even in the case of 'translation' within languages: thus I encounter the greatest difficulty, at times wellnigh total obstruction, vis-a-vis some contemporary poetry. Of course, translation also embodies a strongly impressionistic and personal element, matters of taste and judgement. Steiner gives us an excellent example of a passage by Beckett, translated into French by Beckett himself. That the 'transfer is flawless' (pp. 473-4) goes without saying, yet Steiner detects tones and nuances in his comparison of the two texts that are lost on me. The correlation of 'that rising corn' and 'ce b16 qui lve' to Steiner 'speaks of worlds different enough to allow the mind both space and wonder'. I am too blind or too deaf to recognize this distinction. The sound patterns do not convey to me what they do to Steiner, and the different modes of expressing the notion of' rising' are not so much determined, in this case, by syntactical inevitabilities as by feelings of rhythm, collocation, and taste. The author has also a number of things to say about the role of English as a world language. As in other spheres, here too sane and illuminating observations rub shoulders with abstruse and ominous pronouncements, with resentments, and cavalier judgements. That ' a large part of the impulse behind the spread of English across the globe is political and economic ' (p. 468) cannot be doubted. Nor would one necessarily deny that 'in the aftermath of the Second World War ... English acted as the vulgate of American power and of Anglo-American technology and finance'. More questionable is the assertion</page><page sequence="17">GEORGE STEINEI'S AFTER BABEL 419 that the causes of that universality are also linguistic : ' There is ample evidence that English is regarded by native speakers of other languages, whether in Asia, Africa or Latin America, as easier to acquire than any other second language. It is widely felt that some degree of competence can be achieved through mastery of fewer and simpler phonetic, lexical, and grammatical units...'. I do not know what 'ample evidence' Dr. Steiner has in mind; it has certainly not come my way. In fact, what evidence I have assembled would suggest that in purely practical linguistic terms Italian fulfils the desideratum of easier acquisition much more readily. It is primarily those extra-linguistic factors to which Dr. Steiner himself has referred which have launched English into its global role. Furthermore, Dr. Steiner thinks that 'It can fairly be argued that the energies of innovation, of linguistic experiment, have passed from the centre. Has there been an " English English " author of absolutely the first rank after D. H. Lawrence and J. C. Powys ?' (p. 469). This is, of course, an intensely personal judgement, and there are many who would vigorously dissent from it. Professor Donald Davie has dealt with this matter in characteristically felicitous ways. Steiner's plaint that 'Much of contemporary verse, drama, fiction written in England is spare, minimalist, and thoroughly distrustful of verbal exuberance' sounds ominously like a personal resentment. Yet distrust of verbal exuberance is surely to be commended ! And so is spareness if it connotes leanness, pithiness. ' Minimalist' I do not really know, but I suspect it stands for reticence and a reluctance to exhibit all one's wares. When his personal feelings are not engaged, Steiner can and does say some apposite and lucid things: 'The internationalization of English has begun to provoke a twofold enervation. In many societies imported English, with its necessarily synthetic, " pre-packaged " semantic field, is eroding the autonomy of the native language- culture. Intentionally or not, American-English and English, by virtue of their global diffusion, are a principal agent in the destruction of natural linguistic diversity. This destruction is, perhaps, the least reparable of the ecological ravages which distinguish our age. More subtly, the modulation of English into an " Esperanto " of world-commerce, technology, and tourism, is having debilitating effects on English proper' (p. 470). The oddities of this international English can often be observed in learned journals. Contributors with an inadequate command of the language present their offerings in this twilight zone of enervated world-English-and without correction by editors who are too busy to trouble over stylistic ' trivia '. On this subject I have never seen anything more apt than the preface of a Dutch author who clearly did not require his own disclaimer: 'An additional remark on the linguistic appearance of this book should be made here. Contrary to what at a first glance may seem to be the case, this book is not in English. It has been written in a lingua franca of the Western world of the middle of the 20th century, which by some is mistakenly called VOL. XXXIX. PART 2. 29</page><page sequence="18">420 GEORGE STEINER'S AFTER BABEL English, and which in fact owes a good deal to English, particularly as far as its vocabulary and syntax are concerned. For the rest, however, it betrays a considerable amount of influence of many different patterns of thought and patterns of expression. To British and American readers this may well imply a certain amount of frustration in reading this text. Realizing this, the present writer feels a certain embarrassment in submitting the results of his labour in the disguise of this peculiar vehicular language. His hesitation has only been overcome by his awareness that thus far this category of readers have been prepared, in cases comparable to this, to show the clemency that seems to be the corollary of their success in avoiding to learn foreign languages by spreading their own' (C. A. 0. van Nieuwenhuijze, Aspects of Islam in post-colonial Indonesia, The Hague, 1958 p. xii). So much more deserves to be said about After Babel, its insights and its errors, its luminosities and its densities, its beauties and its exasperations. One suspects that, when George Steiner came to the end of his prodigious labours, he felt as bewildered as some of his readers who, in putting down this heavy tome, may think of Lewis Carroll: 'I said it in Hebrew-I said it in Dutch, I said it in German and Greek, But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much) That English is what you speak !
