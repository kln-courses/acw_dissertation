<plain_text><page sequence="1">Prédation, Narration, and Adaptation: "Little Red Riding Hood" Revisited Michelle Scalise Sugiyama University of Oregon Perrault' s "Little Red Riding Hood" loses much of its appeal be- cause it is so obvious that his wolf is not a rapacious beast but a meta- phor. (168) - Bruno Bettleheim Introduction If literary success is measured in longevity and universality, then "Little Red Riding Hood" ("LRRH") is one of the most successful stories of all time. The tale appears cross-culturally in two basic types, known as "The Glutton" (AT 333) and "The Wolf and the Kids" (AT 123). "LRRH" is classified as the former type, but, as Dundes argues, the two types are "probably cognates, possi- bly subtypes of the same general tale type (with the critical difference depending upon whether the wolf comes to the house of the children or the children come to the house of the wolf)" (202-03).1 Variants of AT 333 and AT 123 have been found not only throughout Europe, but in China (Eberhard; Ting), Japan (Ikeda), Korea (Choi), and Africa as well (Arewa; Klipple). AT 123 dates back at least to classical antiquity, appearing among Aesop's fables (Dundes 204). What is it about this story that makes it so popular and enduring? This ques- tion has provided fodder for many anthropologists, folklorists, and historians, whose responses are reviewed in Dundes' Little Red Riding Hood: A Casebook. some have linked the story to solar or other mythology; others believe it is rooted in ancient puberty rites, and still others see it as a comment on political oppression. A number of scholars have also examined specific variants of the tale vis à vis the socio-political milieu in which they were produced (Darnton; Jager). However, the interpretation that has garnered the most sustained interest over the last few decades is that which sees "LRRH" as a tale of seduction - as a coming-of-age story in which an innocent girl on the brink of sexual maturity is confronted with raw male sexuality (Bettleheim; Dundes; Fromm). In substance, this interpretation does not differ from that implied by the moral Perrault ap- pends to his version: "From this story one learns that children, / Especially young lasses, / Pretty, courteous and well-bred, / Do very wrong to talk to strangers" (Perrault 6). Fromm, for example, interprets the warning the girl re- ceives from her mother not to stray from the path as a caution to guard her vir- ___</page><page sequence="2">ginity, and the wolfs suggestion that she stay awhile in the woods to pick flow- ers as an act of seduction. And, though he faults Perrault's version of the tale for belaboring the point (169), Bettleheim's interpretation is quite similar to his: "Little Red-Cap's danger is her budding sexuality, for which she is not yet emo- tionally mature enough" (173; see also Fromm). Although his approach is femi- nist rather than Freudian, Zipes ("'Little Red Riding Hood,'" Trials), too, gives the tale a sexual interpretation, arguing that the story perpetuates the patriarchal myth that rape is the fault of the victim. Each of these interpretations has its strengths and weaknesses, which have been duly noted through the years (Dundes). One thing they have in common is a tendency to gloss over the literal meaning of the tale. Although its central mo- tif of a strong individual overpowering a weaker one certainly lends itself to a variety of metaphorical applications, the story surely owes much of its emotional power - and hence its universality and longevity - to its evocation of that most primeval and visceral of threats: prédation. Dundes cites a handful of works that advance functional interpretations (207, 23 1)2 but dismisses them on the grounds that "it is a truism but a gross over-simplification of 'Little Red Riding Hood' to say it is a warning-tale for little girls to stay out of the forest!" (231, n34). In defense of this claim, he argues that, while fairy tales do indeed contain interdictions, it is the violation of these interdictions that makes the plot possi- ble. It is difficult to see how this criterion precludes or devalues a functional interpretation, according to which LRRH violates the interdiction against dally- ing in the forest, and is punished by being eaten (or nearly eaten) by the wolf. Furthermore, to argue that a functional interpretation of the tale is an "oversim- plification" is to suggest that the problem of predator avoidance is a simple one. Nothing could be further from the truth: avoidance of animal attack involves at the very least (1) identifying a given dangerous animal, (2) understanding the nature of the threat it poses (e.g., kicking, biting, scratching, impaling), (3) knowing how best to avoid this particular animal (i.e., being familiar with its behavior, habitat, and range), and (4) in the case of an encounter, knowing how to defend oneself against this particular animal (e.g., freeze, flee, climb a tree, charge). Additionally, it is eminently more reasonable and responsible to posit a "simple" functional interpretation that makes sense than a "complex" symbolic interpretation that doesn't. Freudian interpretations are a case in point. The con- ceptualization of the mind developed by Freud was abandoned long ago by scholars of human psychology and cognition, and is steadily losing credibility in other fields.3 The central flaw of Freudian theory is that it misunderstands the concept of function: in order for a psychological "need" to evolve, its fulfillment must contribute to the fitness of the organism bearing it. We see this shortcom- ing illustrated in Dundes' interpretation of the tale: he argues that it is an expres- __</page><page sequence="3">sion of "infantile desires and fears" (226) stemming from "inter-generational conflict between daughter and mother" (223), yet neglects to specify what the conflict is about! Parents and their offspring do indeed have different - often conflicting - fitness interests (Daly and Wilson, Sex, Homicide), but these inter- ests are numerous and vary with the age, sex, health, and so on of the parent and offspring in question. Thus, intergenerational conflict is not an explanation in itself but, rather, a phenomenon to be explained: one must identify the particular fitness interests that are in conflict in any given case. Consider also the Oedipal paradigm, which has also been applied to "LLRH" (e.g., Bettleheim). This model posits that all children go through a stage in which they desire their opposite-sex parent and wish to kill their same- sex parent, and that these urges are extinguished through cultural means. Given the biological hazards of incest, it is difficult to imagine what selection pres- sure^) could possibly lead to the evolution a motivational system that, because it threatens that organism's survival and reproductive future, must subsequently be extinguished (Scalise Sugiyama, "New Science"). Bodies - especially brains - are costly to operate; a mechanism that expended energy in such a prodigal fashion would not last long. If it is a literary crime to oversimplify a story, then it should also be a crime to overcomplicate a story. Consider the fact that both oral and literary versions of AT 123 and AT 333 were commonly told to children (Eberhard; Zipes, Ver- sions). While esoteric symbolic interpretations may be obvious to folklorists and literary scholars, children don't get them. As Zipes writes, Perrault "sought to appeal to the erotic and playful side of adult readers who took pleasure in naughty stories of seduction. This irony was lost on younger readers" {Versions 9). Bettleheim appears to agree: "In Perrault's asides and the morals appended to the stories, he speaks as if he were winking at the adults over the heads of the children" (168). Children's minds work very literally. If we are looking for the source of the universal appeal of a tale told to children, it is probably wise to stick with the obvious. On this point, the narrative discretion that sexual interpretations of "LRRH" attribute to the tale is not characteristic of the oral tradition. While Perrault's version of the tale was clearly intended as an allegory "in which seducers are depicted as having the traits of wolves" (Saintyves 73), his version is widely regarded as a "literary fable" (Dundes 3) - that is, as a sanitized, gentrified, and hence unrepresentative treatment of the story (Bettleheim; Dundes; Zipes Tri- als). In contrast to Perrault's (and also the Grimm's) literary treatments of Euro- pean fairy tales, oral literature tends to be unabashedly frank regarding sex and other bodily functions. A Copper Eskimo tale, for example, tells of people who have no rumps: "They do not really eat, they simply suck the juice out of the meat and then leave it. When they have to relieve nature they take the piece of 7Ï2 ■</page><page sequence="4">meat and go out with it, and after having pretended to relieve themselves they no longer feel the need of an evacuation" (Rasmussen, Copper Eskimos 207). A Hudson Bay Eskimo variant of the tale tells us that, not only did these poor peo- ple lack anuses, but "the women had no genitals, and Aningat could therefore never lie with his wife. One day he suddenly took a knife and made a slit in her lap, such as women usually have" (Rasmussen, Hudson Bay Eskimos 80). Geni- talia appear to be a topic of perennial interest. One Mocovi tale, for example, tells why the iguana has two penises, while another tells of a man whose penis became as long as a mule's (Wilbert and Simoneau, Mocovi 69, 249). The Yanomamo tell of a man who made his penis thinner by rubbing it against some rocks (Wilbert and Simoneau, Yanomamo 63), and several of their tales relate the perils of violating menstruation taboos (Wilbert and Simoneau, Yanomamo 470, 494, 495, 496, 498, 499, 500). Yet another Yanomamo story, which tells how the koli people created women and sex, gives the reader a feel for the frankness with which such subjects are treated: They came to visit the bat people and noticed them copulating on the calf. . . . "That's bad, that's wrong, you shouldn't copulate on the calf," they said. They looked about, everyone had a penis! "There's no woman! That's why they do it. . ." The koli people pulled off a penis: tan' "Look!" they said. They pierced a hole where the penis had been and thus made a vagina. Far- ther down, round here, they made another hole, the anus. "Here!" said the koli people. "This hole here is where to copulate, not the calf," they said, indicating the vagina. So the bat people began to copulate: glos! Glos! Glos! "Yes, rnrnram! Thank you," they said. (Wilbert and Si- moneau, Yanomamo 64-65) The reader might object that, whereas the preceding examples are drawn from egalitarian foraging societies, "LLRH" is, to the best of our knowledge, the product of stratified agrarian societies. In its oral form, however, "LRRH" ex- hibits the same frankness: as Dundes notes, "the oral versions are ever so much more explicit than most of the tame children's book adaptations" (227). It is well known that Perrault and the Grimm brothers removed some of the cruder ele- ments of the tale in order to avoid offending the genteel audiences at whom their treatments were directed (Bettleheim; Dundes; Zipes, Trials). One such omis- sion is the trick the girl uses to escape the wolf. She tells her "grandmother" that she needs to go to the bathroom. The wolf tells her to go in the bed, but the child insists on going outside because of the smell. The wolf finally agrees, provided that she tie a rope around her foot. When she is safely outside, the girl removes the rope from her foot and ties it to a tree. After some time has passed, the wolf calls out to her, "Are you making cables?" (Delarue 16). There is no answer, of course, because she has escaped. Chinese (Eberhard), Japanese (Ikeda), and Ko- ПЗ</page><page sequence="5">rean (Choi) variants of the tale utilize this same device. It seems unlikely that delicacy and circumlocution (i.e., through the use of allegory or symbolism) would be deployed in reference to sexual matters when they are not deployed in reference to bodily elimination. This is especially true given the lifestyle of the "common folk" (Zipes, Trials 18), among whom the story appears to have circu- lated for centuries. Farm life necessarily involves the care and breeding of do- mestic animals; the "LRRH" audience would thus have been familiar from a very early age with the mechanics of sexual reproduction. This raises another point: symbolic communication of important informa- tion - such as how to avoid being seduced or raped - is risky. If you want to warn your daughter to guard her virginity against the onslaughts of lustful males, why hazard miscommunication by expressing such critical information in a cryptic manner? As we have seen, the Yanomamo certainly do not take such chances: their tales warn explicitly of the dangers of leaving the menstrual hut prematurely. As Darnton has pointed out, on the most obvious level, "LRRH" is a warning to "stay away from wolves" (10). Perhaps this ancient story about a child who is threatened by a wolf is precisely what it appears to be. Evolutionary psychologists Daly and Wilson make a similar argument re- garding the near-universality of the Cinderella theme in world folklore. They posit that the Cinderella story is an expression of a problem that recurrently be- set humans throughout their evolution, namely the conflict of interests between step-parents and step-children {Homicide 85). The near-universality of the LRRH theme in world folklore suggests that it, too, is an expression of an evolu- tionarily recurrent problem: animal attack. Zipes, for example, notes that oral versions of "LRRH" reflect "the very material conditions of their [peasant] exis- tence and traditional pagan superstition. Little children were attacked and killed by animals and grown-ups in the woods and fields" {Trials 23, emphasis added). The fact of the matter is, wolves do not seduce little girls, but they do occasion- ally eat them - and little boys as well. What I would argue, then, is that while "LRRH" lends itself to various symbolic interpretations, the enduring, universal appeal of the story has its roots in the adaptive problem of predator avoidance. In the remainder of this essay, then, I will (1) review evidence that encounters with dangerous animals were a recurrent, lethal problem for our ancestors; (2) review evidence that such animals are a ubiquitous feature of oral narrative; (3) identify the selection pressure to which oral narrative may be a response; and (4) reexamine universal features of "LRRH" in the context of these findings. Prédation as Adaptive Problem Dangerous animals - animals that bite, scratch, sting, kick, gore, maim, and kill - have been a consistent feature of the environment throughout human evo- 1Ï4</page><page sequence="6">lution. The first Homo sapiens inhabited a landscape teeming with predators, among them saber-toothed cats, lions, leopards, cheetahs, wild dogs, hyenas, jackals, pythons, and crocodiles (Schaller, Serengeti). This threat did not subside when our ancestors migrated out of Africa: as they made their way into the Mid- dle East, Asia, and Europe, they would have encountered the proverbial lions and tigers and bears. Indeed, pictures of lions dating back 15,000 years have been found on cave walls in France (Schaller, Serengeti 5). Although there is little quantitative data on the subject, it is likely that predators and other danger- ous animals constituted a considerable hazard for our ancestors (Dunn). Cer- tainly, it is only quite recently that the majority of humans have become largely immune to animal attack. However, periodic encounters between backpackers and bears, Yellowstone tourists and bison, and suburbanites and mountain lions remind us of our historical place in the animal kingdom. In a word, that place is one of vulnerability. Consider, for example, the fate of a Serengeti poacher "who tried to escape by swimming a river and was apprehended by a crocodile instead" (Schaller, Serengeti 351). Although animal attack is alleged to be a relatively minor cause of death among modern foraging peoples (Dunn; Turnbull), it nevertheless remains a periodic source of harm to health and life. For example, animal attack and snakebite are cited as causes of injury and death among the Mbuti (Turnbull). !Kung men warn that, "'Since buffaloes kill you, you don't go after them'" and "wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) are too frightened to attack people unless there are many of them" (Blurton- Jones and Konner 329, 334). In a study of Shiwiar in- jury and illness frequencies, Sugiyama ("Illness") reports that, out of 678 sur- vived health insults suffered by 40 different individuals over their respective lifetimes, 130 stemmed from animal bites (insects not included). The most prevalent were bites from vampire bats (102), followed by venomous snakes (18), dog, fish, and squirrel (2 each), and assorted other animals. Jaguars were sources of Ache (Hill and Hurtado) and Shiwiar mortality prior to the adoption of shotguns in the area, and are still reported to stalk humans in regions inhab- ited by the Shiwiar of Ecuador (Sugiyama, personal communication) and the Yora of Peru (Sugiyama and Chacon). This is not to suggest that the problem of dangerous animals is confined to foraging peoples or to human prehistory. Lions, for example, ranged throughout Greece, the Near East, India, and Africa well into historical times - in some cases (Syria, Iraq, Iran) into the twentieth century (Schaller, Serengeti 5). Tigers, known for their "occasional predilection for preying on humans" (Schaller, Deer 22 1 ), historically ranged from eastern Turkey to the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia, and as recently as the previous century could be found in Afghanistan, Iran, Russia, Turkmenia, China, North Korea, North Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Cam- bodia, Burma, Sumatra, Java, Bali, India, Bhutan, and Nepal (Schaller, Deer). П5</page><page sequence="7">Although they are now rare on the Tibetan Plateau, the Tibetan brown bear (Ur- siis arctos pruinosus) was very common in the region into the 1930s (Schaller, Wildlife 192). Their shyness and present scarcity notwithstanding, on December 17, 1991, one such bear approached the tent of a herder. The woman inside the tent escaped, but a dog was killed (Schaller, Wildlife 193). In his study of wild- life in India's Kanha Park, Schaller reports the following leopard incidents: in 1961, three people were killed; in 1964, one child was carried off, one child was mauled, and one man was killed; in 1965, one man was killed, one child was taken, and two men were mauled (Deer 311). Interestingly, Schaller notes that while no leopards were resident in the reserve, they were "fairly common around the numerous villages at the periphery and outside the park, where they prey extensively on livestock" (Deer 308). This finding prompts the speculation that, because domestic animals frequently attract predators, some pastoralists may be no safer from predators than hunter-gatherers. Danger may lurk in the water as well as on the land: Nile crocodiles kill several people a year in Mada- gascar ("Secrets"). Nor are predators the only animal threat: in the Sahel region of Africa, people are frequently killed by elephants ("Africa"). Their mention in the New Testament indicates that wolves were present in the Middle East as recently as 2000 years ago: "Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves" (Matt. 7.15, Sandmel 10-11). According to Summers, wolves posed a consider- able threat to Europeans through the Renaissance and possibly beyond (22). In 1587, for example, as she was playing outside her hut in a village near Bor- deaux, a little girl was carried off into the forest by a wolf (95). According to a local clergyman, wolves were such a menace in the area that "men could only go to work armed and together in numbers" (96). It would appear that wolves did not necessarily confine themselves to the woods and rural areas: the aforemen- tioned clergyman reports hearing a terrible howling throughout the cloisters one evening, the source of which turned out to be a pack of eighteen or twenty wolves running through the streets. At the time of his writing (1933), Summers claimed that wolves still roamed parts of France, Belgium, Hungary, East Prus- sia, Austria, and Russia (63). This predator's range also included India where, according to Hrdy (Mother Nature 411), 624 people were killed by wolves in 1878. A number of scholars have noted the possible connection between "LRRH" and werewolf legends (Delarue; Zipes, Trials 23). Indeed, in some versions of the story, the beast is identified as agarou, or werewolf (Delarue 15). Tellingly, stories about this creature have historically been popular in areas where wolves commonly attacked and ate humans (or dug up corpses for the same purpose), such as medieval Europe (Summers). As Senn puts it, "The mythical were-wolf figure in Romania, as in other societies, probably resulted from the interaction of IÏ6</page><page sequence="8">human society with wolves" (1). In other words, the common thread between werewolf legends and "LRRH" appears to be fear of prédation: "although this particular predator [the wolf] has long since disappeared from Romania, its leg- endary ferocity is still recounted in the villages" (Senn 1). Given the high casu- alties suffered by war-torn eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe (O'Connell), the specter of wolves eating humans may have had ample basis in reality. In December of 1812, for example, Napoleon's troops retreated from Moscow through a field described as being littered with "30,000 corpses, half- eaten by wolves" (Marbot, qtd. in O'Connell 184). The constraints imposed by predators (e.g., detection, avoidance, defense) are likely to have exerted considerable selection pressure upon our ancestors. Some anthropologists, for example, have argued that group living in humans and other ground-living primates evolved as a defense against predators (De Vore; Dunbar; Washburn). As Bowlby explains: In the case of the ground-living primates, predators are the great cats (especially leopards), wolves and jackals, and birds of prey. In achiev- ing protection from these predators the organised social group charac- teristic of the terrestrial primate plays an essential part. When members of the group are threatened, the mature males, whether monkeys or men, combine to drive off the predator whilst the females and imma- tures retire. Thus only individuals found alone are likely to fall victim. (62) Due to their lack of size, speed, and experience, children are more vulnerable to attacks by predators than adults are. According to one !Kung man, lions, leop- ards, and wild dogs will all take children who wander off unattended (Blurton- Jones and Konner 334). The aforementioned 624 Indian wolf casualties were mostly children* carried off while they were sleeping (Hrdy, Mother Nature 411). Bowlby argues that attachment behavior in primates (i.e., the close physi- cal and emotional tie between mother and infant) evolved to protect the young from just such a fate. Predators as a Folklore Universal Thompson's folklore motif classification system devotes an entire section to animal motifs. That this system has readily lent itself to the classification of non- European folklore is testimony to the abundance of animals in world folklore.4 Many of these animals are dangerous to humans. In a collection of 222 Moco vi folktales, Wilbert and Simoneau document 335 animal motifs {Močoví). Nine- teen of the 222 stories feature a reference to a threatening animal or to an actual animal attack. Some references are specific (e.g., jaguar, rhea, moray eel, locust, anaconda), others generic (e.g., bird, snake).5 Similarly, the Yanomamo tales П7</page><page sequence="9">collected by Wilbert and Simoneau contain references to snakebite (216) and a variety of man-eating creatures, including jaguars (359), an unidentified snake- monster (447), an anaconda (448), and two kinds offish (451). This motif is also found in Africa: a key metaphor in !Kung oral literature, Ikxwoi !go, refers to "a constellation of ideas relating to avoidance of carnivore attack" (Biesele, "Sapi- ence" 923). Folktales often make explicit reference to the danger posed by a given animal, as in the following excerpt from a Tehuelche story: "They say that the condor . . . used to come to carry off the small children of the ancient ones. But they did not know who took them. Instead, they went to the mountains, thinking it was the puma who carried off the little ones" (Wilbert and Simoneau, Tehuelche 51). Tellingly, this pattern holds for European folklore as well: among the most common wild animals in Aarne's tale-type index are wolves, bears, jackals, lions, and tigers - all of which are potentially dangerous to hu- mans. These findings point to the existence of a folklore genre that involves a predator attacking a vulnerable individual (often a child) or individuals.6 On this point, it is significant that most versions of "Grandaunt Tiger" (AT 123) are set in the mountains rather than in a city or town (Eberhard). According to Eber- hard, "In South China 'mountains' have the connotation of 'forest,' and 'forest' for a Chinese has always been threatening, being the domicile of wild animals or ghosts" (25-26). It seems unlikely that the preponderance of animals in folklore is a coinci- dence. As Blurton Jones and Konner observe, "The long period in human evolu- tion during which man lived as a hunter and gatherer may be expected to have included a selection pressure on the human brain, such that man became inter- ested in animal behavior and competent in finding out about it" (326). The next section will examine just how narrative may be used as a means of "finding out about" animal behavior. Narrative as a Proxy for Experience Access to information that increased an individual's chances of survival and/or reproduction is believed to have exerted selection pressure on hominids from the very outset (Dunbar; Kurland and Beckerman; Tooby and De Vore). Because first-hand acquisition of such information can be very costly in terms of time, energy, and/or risk, we would expect selection to have favored the devel- opment of a design that, whenever the opportunity arose, bypassed this method in favor of second-hand acquisition. Such a design would require the develop- ment of a system (or systems) for storing and transmitting valuable information once it is acquired (Scalise Sugiyama, "Food," "Cultural Variation," "Reverse- Engineering"). On this point, Mithen proposes that the primary motivation be- _____</page><page sequence="10">hind the production of Upper Paleolithic art was information gathering. He ar- gues that cave paintings and bone carvings depict environmental cues that fora- gers utilize to locate and track prey, thus identifying "which cues, from the infi- nite number available in the natural environment, are the most important. Con- sequently the art may be related to the development of selective attention in young children" (246). Certain games may operate in a similar fashion (Bolton and Smith). Consider, for example, the wolf game played by the Hudson Bay Eskimos, "in which a few are wolves and the rest human beings chased by the wolves" (Rasmussen, Hudson Bay Eskimos 87). This game calls to mind the ethological maxim that animal play functions, in part, as a means of acquiring and honing skills requisite to eluding predators and/or tracking, stalking, and killing prey (Bertrand; Dolhinow; Egan; Groos). It is difficult not to see the wolf game as practice for the grim possibility of being pursued by actual wolves. Similarly, narrative may function as cognitive "play" - that is, as practice for the challenges and hazards of human existence (Scalise Sugiyama, "Food," "Reverse-Engineering"). By serving as a proxy for experience, narrative enables humans to acquire information pertinent to the pursuit of various fitness goals without undertaking the costs and risks of first-hand experience. Narrative ap- pears to be well-suited to conveying information that may be deployed in attack- ing several broad fields of selection pressure, such as subsistence, social interac- tion, and, as I have argued here, predator avoidance (Scalise Sugiyama, "Ori- gins," "Food," "Reverse-Engineering"). Thus, just as fire drills rehearse strate- gies for avoiding harm when faced with conflagration, stories about predators may rehearse strategies for avoiding injury when faced with a dangerous animal, or for avoiding such encounters entirely. Due to their relative inexperience and weakness compared to adults, chil- dren are particularly vulnerable to animal attack: they are less likely than adults to be familiar with the characteristics and habits of dangerous animals, and more likely than adults to be overtaken by dangerous animals due to their being slower (hence easier to catch) and lighter (hence easier to overpower and carry off). As noted in the previous section, many stories about predators feature a child as the victim. Such stories may serve as "exposure" to dangerous animals, presenting information relevant to preventing lethal encounters. In the case of "LRRH," the listener is not only made aware of a potentially lethal threat (wolves), but is told (1) how to identify the threat (i.e., big ears, teeth, etc.), (2) how to avoid the threat (i.e., don't go into the woods alone, and don't dally while you're there), and (3) what might happen to him or her should this infor- mation be disregarded (i.e., he or she might be eaten). To twenty-first century Western readers, it may seem improbable that a forager child would have to be told what a wolf looks like, but wild animals are of necessity shy and secretive: consider how rarely we catch a glimpse of a wolf, bear, or mountain lion in our __</page><page sequence="11">remaining wilderness areas. We know these animals from picture books, zoos, and National Geographic specials. From the perspective of a hunter-gatherer parent, it is much safer for a child to learn about dangerous fauna via verbal de- scription than via personal experience. Tellingly, the litany of questions LRRH asks her "Grandma" reads as a checklist of salient wolf characteristics: "Oh, Grandmother, how hairy you are!" "It's to keep me warmer, my child." "Oh, Grandmother, those long nails you have!" "It's to scratch me better, my child!" "Oh, Grandmother, those big shoulders that you have!" "All the better to carry kindling from the woods, my child." "Oh, Grandmother, those big ears that you have!" "All the better to hear with, my child." "Oh, Grandmother, that big mouth you have!" "All the better to eat you with, my child!" (Delarue 16; emphasis added) The cognate tale-type, AT 123, also commonly contains the motif of disguise on the part of the predator and suspicion on the part of the victim(s). In variants of "Grandaunt Tiger," for example, the children object to a variety of her (tiger- like) features: her gruff voice; rough, hairy, or dark hands; hairy face; nails; feet; and so on (Eberhard 32-33). Narrative thus makes it possible to "show" a child that a given animal is dangerous before it actually has an encounter with that animal and without ex- posing the child to danger during the learning process. Such preparation offers an obvious fitness advantage, which can be vividly seen by visualizing the op- posite case. First, imagine that a child wanders off from her adult protectors and spots an animal in the distance that she has never seen before. Next, imagine that the animal is a lion. Finally, imagine that the child has never been told what li- ons look like or that they should be avoided. In such a situation, all else being equal, an informed child has better chances of survival than an uninformed child.7 On this point, it is important to note that the common denominator among the variants of "LLRH" is not the red hood, the warning to stay on the path, the wolfs encouragement of the child to linger in the woods, or the child's rescue by a passing woodsman (Darnton; Delarue) - details upon which sexual inter- pretations of the tale variously depend. As Dundes observes, "the Perrault liter- ary reworking of AT 333 is far from being the most typical version of the tale type" (202). Rather, the basic plot elements of these tales are as follows: a child is threatened by a predatory animal that poses as a non-threatening familiar (e.g., grandmother, mother, grandaunt); the child questions the familiar's identity; then, realizing the danger she/he is in, the child escapes by the use of its own "Ï20</page><page sequence="12">wits. The identity test seems much better suited to the task of distinguishing a threatening animal from a non-threatening one (or distinguishing an animal from a human) than to distinguishing a threatening adult from a non- threatening one. One's grandmother is no more or less likely to have big pointy ears, sharp teeth, and a fur-covered body than a rapist is. To put it another way, big ears, big teeth, long nails, and hairiness are not characteristics reliably associated with seducers, rapists, or other criminals, whereas they are reliably associated with wolves. -Little Red Riding Hood" Revisited The question remains, if "LRRH" is rooted in the adaptive problem of predator avoidance, why is the wolf anthropomorphised? I would argue that the use of anthropomorphism invests the tale with a secondary, highly adaptive, and - not coincidentally, I think - very popular message: strangers can be dan- gerous. Because the wolf character exhibits human as well as animal characteris- tics, we can respond to him as a person as well as a beast. Anthropomorphising the wolf character gives him a dual nature: he is not a metaphor for a menacing human male; he is both, a wolf (e.g., in his physical characteristics and appetite) and a human (e.g., in his speech and use of disguise).8 On this view, the "beware of strangers" interpretation, like the predator-avoidance interpretation, is not symbolic but "functional." Interestingly, Hrdy's discussion of infanticidal males suggests that the fear of strangers may be just as deeply rooted in our evolutionary past as the fear of dangerous animals {Mother Nature 408-18). Among many primate species (e.g., langurs, howler monkeys, gorillas, chimpanzees, baboons), newly-dominant males kill the infants of females with whom they have not yet mated. Shocking as it is, such behavior serves the homicidal male's fitness interests by bringing the female into estrus sooner, thereby enabling him to mate with her and begin producing his own offspring. Because this behavior is so widespread among primate species, scholars are rethinking the role that infanticide may have played in hominid evolution (Hrdy, Mother Nature, Woman). Hunter-gatherer interbirth intervals (i.e., length of time between the births of a woman's children), which range from 2.3 to 5.4 years (Kelly 246), are rela- tively large compared with those seen in modern Western societies. The reason for this is that lactation suppresses ovulation, and hunter-gatherer technology does not offer an alternative to breastfeeding. The diet of foraging peoples tends to be much lower in fat and calories and less nutritively consistent than that of industrialized peoples; as a result, breast milk is the healthiest, most nourishing food available for infants and small children. Children are commonly nursed for 24-48 months (Kelly 248) and only one child can be nursed at a time (Chagnon; Shostak). Given these constraints, it takes four to five years for a forager woman __</page><page sequence="13">to conceive, carry, nurse, and wean a single child (Kelly). From a male point of view, however, a female nursing a child of which he is not the father is an avoidable constraint on his reproductive output: if he kills the infant, the female will begin ovulating again, at which point he can impregnate her. As horrible as this sounds, it is not uncommon in the animal world. Newly-dominant males of several different species (e.g., langurs, lemmings, lions) are known to kill off- spring of usurped males in order to bring the females back into estrus more quickly and begin fathering their own offspring (Bertram; Mallory and Brooks; Y. Sugiyama). Among humans, males have been observed to kill the children of other males, and even to demand the death of a wife's children by a previous mate (Balikci; Chagnon; Firth; Hrdy, "Infanticide"). Thus, it is possible that, over the course of human evolution, infants and young children were vulnerable to prédation by adult males of their own species. Tellingly, Hrdy {Mother Nature) notes, fear of strangers, in the form of a stereo- typed panic response, appears almost universally in the second half of the first year of life - the point at which a baby becomes capable of crawling or walking away from its caretaker. Hostile interactions between neighboring social groups - in the form of raids or warfare - would have rendered untended infants and small children vulnerable to attack by strange males. Tellingly, the archaeo- logical record indicates that human prehistory was characterized by frequent raiding and warfare (Martin and Frayer; Kelly). The parental impulse to warn offspring not to talk to strangers and not to wander off alone may be rooted in these threats. It is no wonder, then, that "LRRH" is such an effective tale: it packs a double emotional wallop by combining our evolved fear of being harmed by animals with our evolved fear of being harmed by strangers. On this view, it is significant that tellers of the tale commonly characterize LLRH as a pre-adolescent child. Samber (1729), for example, refers to her as a "little girl" and the language she uses sounds like that of a small child: "I am going to see my grandmamma, and carry her a custard pye, and a little pot of butter my mamma sends her" (Zipes, Versions 74). In Marelle's (1888) version of the story, LLRH is referred to as a "little peasant girl" (Zipes, Versions 1 72), and the wolf tells her that his mouth full of huge teeth is for "'crunching little children with'" (Zipes, Versions 174). De La Mare (1927) puts her age at seven (Zipes, Versions 188), and his descriptions of her behavior and speech clearly suggest a girl ofthat age. Delarue notes that independent oral versions of the tale refer to the girl as "'une petite fille,' 'une petite,' 'la piteta," etc." (18), which again suggests a child rather than a teenager. Dundes argues that the reference to defecating in bed, the toddler's rope, and the protagonist's name all suggest a very young child (226). Finally, in his discussion of common features of 241 Chinese variants of AT 123, Eberhard reports that the family in the story typi- cally features a mother who has "fairly young children - if their ages are given, Ì22</page><page sequence="14">they are around 8-10 years" (26). We must therefore consider the possibility that characterizing LRRH as a sexually vulnerable adolescent was yet another liberty Perrault took with the oral form of the tale. One might argue that even very little girls can be vulnerable to sexual abuse, but this has certainly been the exception rather than the rule throughout human evolutionary history, during the vast ma- jority of which very young girls have been much more vulnerable to animal at- tack than to rape.9 This reading is strengthened by the fact that, although sexual interpretations of the story assume that its warning is aimed at pubescent girls, the story appeals strongly to boys as well. This suggests that, on the universal level, the story simulates a facet of human experience that is common to both sexes. Hrdy's work suggests that this universal experience is the threat of murder. However, since boys as well as girls may fall victim to molestation or rape, a responsible scholar must also consider the hypothesis that the story's common appeal and emotional power are rooted in the threat of sexual harm. In a preliminary trial of an experimental protocol designed to tease out an answer to this question, 1 asked my nine-year-old son what he thought the moral of the story was. He said, "Don't talk to strangers." Then 1 asked him what was the scariest thing about the story. He said, "The wolf." I asked him why. His answer: "Because the wolf tried to eat Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother." Notes ]As further testimony to this proposition, Dundes notes that the two tale- types are cross-referenced in Thompson's revision of the tale-type index (202- 03). These works are unfortunately unavailable to me, as they are written in languages I can't read. See, for example, Crews; Daly and Wilson Homicide; Degler; Erickson; Eysenck; Grunbaum; Scalise Sugiyama, "New Science"; and Sulloway. 4See, for example, El-Shamy; Waterman; Wilbert; and Wilbert and Si- moneau (Mataco, Mocovi, Tehuelche, Yanomami). 5This number includes variants; the number of different tales in the collec- tion is thus less than 222. See, for example, Calvino; In-Sob; Norledge; Riordan; Weinreich; and Ya- nagita. This is not to suggest that oral narrative is aimed exclusively at children. Darnton, for example, notes that the fairy tale audience typically included adults, and Chagnon observes that adult Yanomamo find myths and stories just as amusing as their children do (see also Biesele, "Aspects," Women Like Meat; Freuchen; Marshall; Tonkinson; Wilbert; Wilbert and Simoneau, Mataco). 123</page><page sequence="15">Among foraging peoples, stories tend to be told to whomever cares to listen, and tend to be crafted such that they offer something of interest to both children and adults (see, e.g., Biesele, Women Like Meat; Lowie; Rasmussen, Hudson Bay Eskimos, Copper Eskimos; Wilbert; Wilbert &amp; Simoneau, Mataco). Indeed, evi- dence suggests that adults as well as children acquire knowledge by listening to stories (Scalise Sugiyama, "Food"). 8My view of anthropomorphism is greatly indebted to Mithen's thoughts on the subject. 9While it is true that some men are sexually attracted to pre-adolescent girls, the vast majority of men are not. Thornhill and Palmer report that "rapists pri- marily target females offertile ages. This pattern is seen in every available set of data on female rape victimization" (71). Works Cited Aarne, Antti.
