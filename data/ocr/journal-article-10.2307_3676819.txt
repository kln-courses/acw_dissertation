A. 1986. Parental investment in clutch size and egg size in the Ural Owl Strix uralensis. - Ornis Scand. 17: 309-325. Reproduction of the Ural Owl was followed in a population of about 140 pairs on an area of 2200 km2 of south-boreal coniferous forests in Finland. All pairs bred in nest- boxes and almost every breeding female was ringed. We measured 331 clutches of 145 females in 1977-1984. The number of breeding pairs depended on the 3-4 year vole cycles. Only 24% of the females laid eggs during vole lows, while 76% laid in peak years. Average clutch size decreased from 3.48 in good through 3.01 in intermediate to 2.25 eggs in poor breeding seasons. The yearly median date of laying varied over 29 days, from 25 March 1983 (good vole year) to 23 April 1977 (poor vole year). Early laying seasons were preceded by warm autumns and mild winters with a good vole supply. Clutch size decreased by 0.09 eggs d-1 as the season advanced. The high- est female components of egg size rose to 80-90% in poor and intermediate years, but decreased to about 65-75% in good years. Thus egg size among females differed most in poor breeding seasons and less when more food was available. According to the theory of life history tactics, individuals of long-lived species re- producing in fluctuating environments should adjust their reproductive efforts to the prevailing conditions. Ural Owls vary their clutch size and egg size (both within and between clutches) in relation to the quality of the breeding season. Mean egg size in- creases and within-clutch variation in egg size decreases as the prevalence (relative frequency) of a clutch increases. Assuming that nestling mortality is independent of clutch size, the most prevalent clutches will also be the most profitable. Observed within and between clutch variation in egg size may be explained as a female's tactical response to the profitability of her investment. However, the possibility that the ob- served patterns are related to the variation in territory quality is not definitely ex- cluded. H. Pietiaiinen and R. A.

The observed life history tactics are evolved responses to the environment (Stearns 1976, Southwood 1977). Individuals of long-lived species that utilise fluctuating food resources should adjust their reproductive efforts to the prevailing conditions in order to maximise their fitness (Hirschfield and Tinkle 1975, Goodman 1979). An inherent assumption in these ideas is that the corre- lated traits expressed as reproductive tactics have a ge- netic basis and are consequently prone to natural se- lection. The number of surviving offspring per life-time is very difficult to measure in natural populations. The only predatory bird for which this is known is the Spar- rowhawk Accipiter nisus (Newton 1985), which pro- duced between zero and 23 offspring in a lifetime. Usu- ally we must be satisfied with estimates based on yearly mean productivities. The Ural Owl Strix uralensis is a sedentary, long-lived Received 26 April 1985 Revised 1 November 1985 Accepted 1 December 1985 ?

The sedentary habit can best be understood in the light of scarcity of suitable nesting sites (Lund- berg 1979). The annual adult mortality is low, about 11% (Lundberg and Westman 1984, own obs.). Because of the fluctuating environment (vole cycles), the pro- duction of young and their recruitment rates vary from one breeding season to another. Although difficult and even dangerous to work with, the Ural Owls have some characteristics that make a long-term study worthwhile. The Finnish population is reasonably dense, and the pairs readily accept nest- boxes. In addition, the females are easy to catch, and more important, the birds' nesting success does not seem to be affected by our activities at nests. In this study we analyse the variation in clutch size and egg size of the Ural Owl. We assume that the invest- ments by the birds in the number and size of eggs corre- late with reproductive effort, and that they can be used in an intraspecific assessment of evolved reproductive tactics. After investigating the amount and pattern of vari- ation, we suggest two explanatory hypotheses within the frame of the life history theory: (1) Despite yearly fluc- tuation in territory quality, there are also notable differ- ences between territories within years. Mean egg size and within clutch variation in egg size depends on the condition of the laying female. (2) Between territory variation in food supply is negligible compared with yearly fluctuations. Females can adjust their mean egg size and variation within clutches according to their own condition in relation to the general quality of the breed- ing season. We test the predictions of these hypotheses in the Discussion. 2. Study area, material and methods The owls were studied in two separate south-boreal coniferous forest areas in southern Finland (Fig. 1). The eastern section of the study area (studied by HP) was di- vided into three subareas, southern (AS), middle (AM) and northern (AN). The proportion of successional de- ciduous forests increases from about 20% in the south to 40-50% in the north. The proportion of pasture land of the cultivated area increases from south to north from about 20% to 30-40%. Pastures are important habitats of Microtus voles. AM is an overlap zone be- tween the intensively cultivated southern part and the more variable landscape of the northern part. The west- ern part of our study area (AW studied by PS) resem- bles both subareas AS and AM, but differs distinctively from subarea AN. Most females were trapped and weighed during the incubation period. We did not correct for weight changes in the incubation period, although both positive and negative trends were observed, because changes de- pended very much on year and territory. We give the age of individuals in calendar years. Thus a bird born in Lake Paijanne AN 40 AW pairs 40 pairs 600km2 700 km2 30 Finland pairs AM 450 6 LahtiL km2 610 N Hameen- linna 30 pairs AS 450 km2 0 50 km Fig. 1. Study areas AW (Hauho), AS (Hollola-Orimattila), AM (Asikkala-Nastola) and AN (Heinola-Hartola) in Hame, southern Finland. The number of pairs within the study areas is rounded off to the nearest ten, and the area is given with an ac- curacy of 50 km2. the previous year is in its 2nd year etc. In total, about 180 adult Ural Owls and 900 young have been marked or recaptured (adults) in the study area in 1977-84. The number of nests in boxes remained at the same level in AW in 1973-84 (max. about 40 pairs on 700 km2, which equals 6 pairs 100 km-2), but increased in the eastern section of the study area, mainly because of a yearly ad- dition of new nest-boxes. In 1984, about 100 pairs lived on roughly 1500 km2 (6-7 pairs 100 km-2). In some years only a minority of the females laid eggs. Eggs were measured in 1977-84 (1977 only in the eastern section). Altogether 331 clutches (1018 eggs) of 145 individual females were measured. Length and breadth of eggs were taken with sliding calipers and the females were weighed with Pesola spring balances. The species-specific formula for the determination of the egg volume (Viiisanen 1969) was obtained by weighing 37 empty Ural Owl egg shells from the collections of the Zoological Museum of the University of Helsinki. These were filled with water and weighed again. The following regression formula, in which volume (V) is in cm3 and length (L) and (B) breadth in cm, explained 94% of the variance of the volume of filled eggs: V = 0.496 x L x B2 - 0.09. The weights of 80 eggs were taken within two days of laying. Our volume formula explained 96% of the vari- ance of egg weight. Thus the volume index is a nearly perfect indicator of egg size. The order of laying was determined in 111 clutches of 68 females. In 61 clutches the eggs were ranked on the basis of differences in colour between successive eggs. Freshly laid eggs are milky white in appearance. As the eggs are laid at intervals of 2-3 days, they rapidly change into dirtier shades of white. This method was most useful in the first half of the incubation period, but we do not recommend its use later, or without previous 310 ORNIS SCANDINAVICA 17:4 (1986)</page><page sequence="3">experience. In 12 clutches the order of laying was deter- mined by marking the eggs as they were laid. Both methods were used in 36 clutches, and in two clutches the first signs of hatching were used in determining egg laying sequence. The date of laying was determined for 217 clutches in the three eastern study areas in 1977-84, either by a visit to a nest where the female was sitting on her incomplete clutch (67 cases), or by calculating the hatching date from the wing length of the oldest chick (150 cases). The calculations were based on daily measurements of 35 chicks in 1983 (H. Pietiainen, unpubl.). We took 32 days as the length of the incubation period, and conside- red the incubation to start from the first egg in clutches of two eggs and from the second egg in larger clutches. We classified the breeding seasons into poor, inter- mediate and good on the basis of the severity of the win- ter and availability of voles. In approximating winter se- verity we used mean monthly temperatures, length of the snowy season and snow depth on the 15th day of each month (climatological data from the nearby town of Lahti, Fig. 1). We did not have vole trapping data, but used Teivainen's (1981, 1982a,b, 1984a,b) data on damage caused by voles on forest tree seedlings as an in- dicator of the size of vole populations in winter. In most cases the classification of the years was straightforward: 1977: Poor. More voles than in 1978 but the winter was rather cold and long. 1978: Intermediate. Short winter, average snow depth did not exceed 30 cm. 1979: Good. Plenty of voles, winter quite normal. 1980: Intermediate. Vole populations were rather low. Winter was short and not very snowy. 1981: Poor. Vole populations showed no sign of re- covery. Already in November the snow depth was 20 cm, and the snowy season lasted until April. March mean temperature (-7.3'C) was the lowest in our study period. 1982: Intermediate. Plenty of voles, but a rather snowy winter (50 cm in March). 1983: Good. Voles remained abundant. Short winter. A lot of signs of vole activity could be seen after the snow had melted. Tab. 1.

Onset of laying and clutch size Linkola and Myllymiki (1969) observed that the Ural Owls lay earlier in good years than in poor ones. In this study we used the dates of laying only from the three eastern study areas. The long-term median date was 5 April, varying from 25 March (1983) to 23 April (1977); Tab. 1). Assuming that energy savings in autumn are important (cf. Sylvan 1982), we took the number of days in October and November with a mean tempera- ture above 00C to indicate the favourability of the au- tumn. Warm autumns were followed by early layings the next spring. Autumn temperature explained 65% (r = 0.81, P &lt;0.05, N = 8) of the variation in the me- dian dates of laying.

Clutch size decreased as the season advanced (y = 3.28 - 0.09x; r = -0.59, P &lt;0.001). Clutch size seems to be tied to the calendar, since 72% (P &lt;0.01) of the variation in mean yearly clutch size was explained by the within-season decline of clutch size. In general there was a significant decrease of 0.05 eggs d-' in the yearly mean cluch size as the median date of laying be- came later (Fig. 2; r = -0.85, P &lt;0.01). When the date of laying was kept constant, partial correlation between mean clutch size and favourability of the autumn was low (r = 0.17). This supports the assumption that the date of laying is an essential factor in determining clutch size. As can be expected from the results above and from previous studies (Linkola and Myllymdiki 1969, Lund- berg and Westman 1984), the clutch size distributions varied from year to year (Tab. 2). The smallest mean clutch size (2.08 eggs) was in 1984, after a mild but snowy winter and scarce vole populations in spring, and the largest in 1983 (3.68 eggs) after a mild winter, and high densities of voles. Mean clutch sizes in years of poor spring populations of voles, in intermediate years, and in good years were 2.25, 3.01 and 3.48 eggs, respec- tively. Clutches of five and six eggs were observed only in intermediate or good breeding seasons. (We excluded all one-egg clutches (N = 11) from our analyses, al- though Mikkola (1983) has sometimes regarded them as genuine full clutches. In 9 clutches we found the one Tab. 2.

In the remaining two cases the possibility of an egg having disappeared before our visit could not be disproved). During the study years, only one replacement clutch after an unsuccessful attempt was recorded (Saurola 1980). In poor years two eggs were laid in about 3/4 of the clutches, and clutch size distribution was positively skewed. Fig. 3B shows how clutch size increases to a mode of three eggs in intermediate breeding seasons and to four eggs in good years. Availability of food acts by pulling the skewed distribution of clutch size in poor years to the right towards a larger average clutch size, larger variance and an almost normal distribution in Fig. 3.

Accordingly, the yearly means and standard deviations of clutch size are positively correlated (r = 0.93, N = 8, P &lt;0.001). The increased variation in clutch sizes in years with a large mean clutch size may be connected with the increase in the number of first- breeders in good and intermediate years (H. Pietiiinen and P. Saurola, unpubl.). The above parameters become biologically more meaningful, when the proportion of nonlaying females - varying from 24% in good years to 76% in poor years - is taken into account using threshold analysis (Fig. 3A). In our application of this method we start from a rather safe assumption that the females differ with respect to the genetic background regulating the complicated re- productive processes of egg formation. A logical exten- sion of this is to treat the decision of laying vs nonlaying as a quantitative, normally distributed threshold charac- ter, which is a compound of several underlying phys- iological variables. Following Falcorner's (1981, Ch. 18) reasoning we asumed that the clutch sizes of two and four are separated by a distance of one hypothetical threshold unit (Fig. 3A). Knowing the proportion of fe- males laying a clutch of ? 2 or ? 4 eggs, we may calcu- late the mean and standard deviation (in threshold units) of 'laying energy'. The standard deviation of good years is 1.6 times the value of poor years (0.98 vs 0.61), and the mean of good years is 1.1 threshold units above the mean of poor years (0.70 vs -0.43). In intermediate years the stan- dard deviation was 0.83 and the mean 0.32. Thus, in poor years females are more alike in their misery, and only a few of them reach the threshold for laying. In ad- dition, the better the year the lower the value of the first threshold in relation to the population mean (Fig. 3A). The distributions in Fig. 3B much resemble the 'vis- ible' portion of the distributions in Fig. 3A. Differences between the year quality classes are, however, smaller in the distributions of 'laying energy', because they overlap more than the 'visible distributions' of clutch size. 3.2. Female weight The weight of an incubating female raptor (Newton et al. 1983) or owl (Hirons et al. 1984) is a good indicator of her physical condition. Being heavy might contribute substantially to the hatching success, because it indi- cates the presence of a buffer against short-time food shortages (Cav6 1968, Southern 1970). The male pro- vides prey to the female during her laying and egg-form- ing periods (Lundberg 1980), as in birds of prey in gen- eral (Newton 1979). Several females (N= 35) were weighed in at least three years. The median value of individual differences between minimum and maximum weight was 155 g (range 25-240 g) or 11% of the average weight of 1016 g. The quality of the year was not expressed to a great Tab. 3. Female weight and its variability in poor, intermediate and good breeding seasons. Female weight (g) Mean S.D. CV ? S.E.

The data are, however, problematic, because the birds were weighed after they had laid. A further complication is that clutch size depends on the date of laying. Assuming that females in all clutch size classes lose weight in a similar manner, we many approximate the relationship between female weight and clutch size. Partial correla- tion between female weight and clutch size, holding the date constant, revealed a positive but nonsignificant correlation in poor years (r = 0.23, N = 15), a highly significant positive correlation in intermediate years (r = 0.38, N = 79) and a null correlation (r = -0.01, N = 77) in good years. 3.3. Clutch medians vs single eggs in analyses of egg size variation In tests of hypotheses based on egg size variation, is it better to use measurements of single eggs (e.g. Grant 1982) or medians of clutches (e.g. van Noordwijk et al. 1981, Jirvinen and Vaiisinen 1984)? Two biases are present in the first method: (1) Statistical outliers (ex- ceptionally small or large eggs) may heavily affect re- sults. (2) Eggs within clutches form sets of intercorre- lated data, which also violates the assumption of inde- pendent observations that underlies most statistical tests; furthermore, females with large clutches have a greater effect on the results than those with small clut- ches. In the second method some information is lost, since data on several eggs in each clutch are reduced to a single clutch median. We defined outliers as eggs, which in our data set made skewness or kurtosis of egg length or breadth to deviate statistically significantly (P &lt;0.01) from nor- mality. Only two such eggs were found (0.2% out of 1018 eggs, Tab. 4A). However, the statistical effect of these two eggs, if included in the analyses, would have been pronounced, especially in tests of hypotheses based on variance components. These two "giant eggs" were in clutches of three and four eggs (two different fe- males). Relative variability (coefficient of variation, CV) was smallest in egg breadth, but was small also in length and shape; it was clearly largest in our index of volume (Tab. 4A), which is a good indicator of egg size (see Methods). The distribution of egg shape was not nor- mal, but we did not regard extreme values of this vari- able as outliers, as will be explained below (Sect. 3.6.).

Standard deviations increased by 10-20%, if single eggs, instead of clutch medians, were used in the cal- culations (Tab. 4A). Changes in coefficients of variation show, however, that this effect was relatively small. More informative are variance components VF be- tween females. The variance components indicate the repeatability of egg size within females (Tab. 4B). If clutch medians are used, the repeatability of egg size is very high in breadth and volume (77%), large in length (67%) and also in shape (58%). If single eggs are used, VF values are lower but remain at a moderately high level, except in shape, (see Tab. 4D). Using clutch medians instead of single eggs naturally affects the statistical analysis in two ways, by decreasing sample sizes and by excluding within-clutch variation. As an example, we compared the variance components of egg size and egg shape in our four study areas (Tab. 4C). The variance component VA decreases, when within-clutch variability is included (Tab. 4D), but the three-fold increase in the numbers of observations makes the values statistically more significant. Even the tiny VA component of egg shape index (0.6%; P = 0.06) is now near the limit of a "fairly significant" difference, but the slightly larger component based on medians (0.9%; P = 0.15) is far from statistical significance. But which approach is biologically relevant? The questions to be answered should be considered first, be- cause statistical efficiency depends on the problem studied. In our comparison we ask whether there are consistent differences in egg dimensions between the areas. The females may be considered to settle at ran- dom in the breeding population on the scale of the spa- tial differences between the four areas. After their first breeding they are highly site-tenacious. Thus, inde- pendent data would consist of mean egg dimensions of single females within the four areas (one value/dimen- sion/female). It is certainly not common to take the ge- netic component (within-clutch variation) into account in testing differences related to habitat quality, but if we do not do so, we bias the data with several clutches of the same females. The bias is even more serious if single eggs are used. Thus neither of the analyses in Tab. 4C do give a final answer to our question. The ANOVAs here give too high a statistical significance for differ- ences between the areas. Below we will use either single eggs or clutch medians as our data base depending on the questions studied. When the effects of single females are of importance, we include the female factor into the models of the nested or the two-way analysis of variance. When the 314 ORNIS SCANDINAVICA 17:4 (1986)</page><page sequence="7">latter method is applied, it is useful to correct clutches to contain a constant number of eggs measured (see Ojanen et al. 1979) so that interaction terms can be cal- culated reliably. 3.4. Area and year effects on reproductive parameters There is evidence for spatial heterogeneity in clutch size, probably reflecting the effect of vole densities (Fig. 4). The Ural Owls in subarea AM in general laid 0.5 eggs smaller clutches than those in subarea AS. The two other areas were intermediate (Tab. 5). Only in 1979 and 1980 were there significant yearly differences be- tween subareas, and, interestingly, in regard to average clutch size the order of study areas was not the same in single years as in the total study period. The fluctuations in clutch size were parallel in areas AS and AW (r = 0.96, P &lt;0.01). We do not separate between sub- areas in our further analyses of egg size variation be- tween clutch sizes, since the observed minor differences do not seriously affect our results. 4.0 .AS AW AM 3.5 NAN AN N AS U.) .. . ........ 3.0 AM . - -J 2.5 - - 2.0 VA 1- 5.8 30.6 27.7 - 0 14 (-) * CO C O OO 1050 AS ca AMAS 00AN A ..... 950 -VA (-) 0 8.7 22.2 ) 17.6" 24.8" (-) 44- AS 43- o 42- AW &gt; AW w 41 AM 1-) 10.6 0.0 4.8 -) 7.8 70 - 40 7 C8 O 0 O 0 0 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 Fig. 4.

These years were also the two latest seasons (Tab. 1). The variations in female weight in areas AN and AM were only seemingly parallel (r = 0.49, ns). The between-area differences in clutch size and female weight were both significant only in 1980 (Fig. 4), which may indicate differences in food supply within the about 100 km long region AS-AN (Fig. 1). Between-area differences in egg breadth and volume were significant (Tab. 7) and rather consistent (Fig. 4). Average egg size in areas AS and AM fluctuated only seemingly in parallel (r = 0.54, ns). In good years the averages of the four study areas tended to converge. Area effects were more consistent in egg dimensions than in clutch size or female weight, which seem to be more susceptible to fluctuations in food supply. In order to illustrate the character of the within-fe- male variation between years, we present distributions of median egg dimensions of 22 females with at least four measured clutches (Fig. 5). Since none of these fe- males changed subarea, regional variation does not bias the observations of individual females. The female com- ponents of weight (21.4%, P &lt;0.01) and clutch size (9.2%, P = 0.09) were distinctly smaller than those of egg dimensions (Tab. 4B). Within females the clutch median values differ with respect to the quality of a year, but there is no apparent trend in the distribution of clutches (Fig. 5). Statistical analysis revealed, how- ever, that the female component of variance decreased from poor through intermediate to good breeding sea- sons in egg breadth, shape and volume, but the opposite was found in egg length (Tab. 8; the variance com- ponents in poor years are based on clutch medians of only three females, but their trend coincides with that in the other variables except in egg length). This implies that the females realize their typical egg breadth, shape and volume in poor breeding seasons, but when more food is available, the differences between the females are smaller. The same result is illustrated by the stan- dard deviations and coefficients of variation of egg breadth, shape and volume in our data set, but the trend in egg length is opposite to that observed in the three other variables (Tab. 8). The above observations were confirmed by compar- ing variation within the same females from one interme- diate breeding season (1978) to the next one (1982), and comparing it with trends between the following good years 1979 and 1983.

Very high female components ap- peared in the data of the intermediate years, the highest ones in breadth (82%) and volume (81%), but rather large and still highly significant in shape (44%). In good years these values dropped by about one-fifth. In breadth and volume this decrease was mainly caused by the appearance of a significant year effect and pro- nounced interactions between females and years in good breeding seasons. Conditions in 1983 were evidently better than in the other good year 1979, since average female weight, clutch size and egg size reached their maximum in 1983. Average egg size increased from one year to the next once, from 1982 to 1983, but this is not convincing, as a total of 12 comparisons like Tab. 9 were computed be- tween successive years. Between 1982-83, two two-way ANOVAs indicated a fairly significant (P &lt;0.05) year effect on egg volume. (The first analysis was based on seven females with four eggs, and the second on 31 fe- males with three eggs).

Trends within different females were more different compared with the situ- ation between the intermediate years 1978 and 1982, when there were no significant interactions. In Tab. 9 trends in egg length were also less clear than those observed for breadth and volume. The female component (61%) remained on a lower level in interme- diate years and dropped only by about one-tenth in the comparison between good years. 3.5. Female weight and egg dimensions in relation to clutch size and laying sequence Females which laid 2 or 3 eggs were leaner than those which laid 4 or 5 eggs (Tab. 10). About 17% of the vari- ation in female weight could be accounted for by differ- ences betwen the clutch sizes (P &lt;0.001). When we analysed female weight in relation to clutch size within year-quality classes, the differences were significant only in intermediate years (P &lt;0.001), accounting for nearly 29% of the variance, and the female weight increased from 2-egg (975?57 g) to 5-egg clutches (1066 + 62 g; Fig. 6A). Differences in female weight be- tween clutch size classes were smallest in good years (1979 and 1983): the variance components of these years were very small (0 and 3.5%; Tab. 11). Improve- ment in the quality of the year is thus seen, together with the increase of female weight, also in smaller vari- ance and coefficient of variation of weight (Tab. 3).

The only significant variance components, those of breadth (1.2%) and shape (1.0%; Tab. 11), were very small and there was no trend in the egg sizes of different clutch size classes. On the year level, the analysis revealed no significant variance components, and several negative components indicated violations against the assump- tions of the statistical model. When clutches of the same year-quality class were combined, an interesting pattern emerged in egg volume (Fig. 6B), although the differ- ences between clutch sizes were insignificant (clutch medians used). In poor breeding seasons the females lay either two larger eggs or three smaller eggs. A similar but less clear trend also appears in intermediate years, since egg size is largest in clutches of two eggs and de- creases to the (very rare) clutches of five eggs. The in- creasing female weight in poor and intermediate years (Fig. 6A) suggests that other factors than food supply per se determine the average egg size in each clutch size class in these years. In good years birds with a rich food supply seem to invest both in clutch size and egg size. In an analysis of egg size within a clutch size class be- tween year-quality classes (single eggs) egg volume dif- fered significantly only in 4-egg clutches (P &lt;0.001). In 5-egg clutches the average egg size was also larger in good than in intermediate years (Fig. 6B), but the dif- ference was not significant. In all Ural Owl clutches there exists a degree of hatching asynchrony within a clutch, which may affect the survival of the young. Studies on gulls (e.g. Parsons 1970, Lundberg and Vaiisinen 1979) and on an icterid, the Common Grackle Quiscalus quiscula (Howe 1976) have revealed the importance of intra-clutch egg size variation in either reinforcing or ameliorating the ef- o24 5 1050 M 17 31 59 14 5 I w ) looo - -J w 22 32 L3 A 950 2 3 4 5-6 4317 43 34 44 80 36 0 w 0 40 0 42 - 22 9 B 2 3 4 5-6 CLUTCH SIZE Fig. 6.

As many Ural Owl individuals breed in several seasons, we may expect to find variable patterns of investment within clutches, depending on the quality of the breed- ing season.

In intermedi- ate years the eggs in clutches of three were all of almost equal size, but in good years egg size decreased (P &lt;0.01, ANCOVA). In 4-egg clutches the eggs were, on average, of about equal size in good years, but in inter- mediate years the last two eggs were considerably smaller than the first two ones (P &lt;0.05, ANCOVA). In 5-egg clutches the first and last egg were smaller than the others, but the differences were not significant. These results suggest that the pattern of within-clutch variation in egg size depends both on clutch size and the quality of the year. 3.6. Effect of age on reproductive parameters The Ural Owls in the study area AW have been under intensive study since the late 1960s (Saurola 1980). In the eastern study area 15% of the females were ringed as nestlings. In addition some females were aged ac- cording to age-specific plumage characters in their 2nd or 3rd spring (Pietiiinen and Kolunen 1986). Thus we had an opportunity to study the effects of age on clutch size and egg dimensions. Our analysis is tentative, be- cause we did not consider the possible effects of breed- ing experience, but focused on the effects of age only. Fig. 8. Effect of age on reproductive parameters: (A) clutch size (0) and year corrected clutch size (0); (B) egg length (0) and breadth (o); and (C) egg shape index (0). The year correc- tion on clutch size was done by subtracting the yearly correc- tion term from each clutch. The correction term was the differ- ence between the mean clutch size of the year in question and the grand mean of means of all eight study years (2.83 eggs). Corrected clutch size was, on average, lower than real clutch size, since the poor years with their low clutch size gained much weight in the correction (cf. Tab. 2).

In the Sparrowhawk the productivity decreases from adult-adult pairs through adult-yearling pairs to yearling-yearling pairs (Newton et al. 1981). Young (2-5 yr) females laid on average 0.5-0.6 eggs smaller clutches than old (6-9 yr) females (Fig. 8A), but this difference is not statistically significant. In egg dimensions, contrary to our expectations, vol- ume showed no significant differences between age classes. The younger females laid significantly (P &lt;0.001, ANOVA) longer and narrower eggs than the older ones (Fig. 8B). Age-specific differences ac- counted for 12% of the variation in length and 10% in breadth. The decrease in length and increase in breadth produced a decreasing pattern of shape indices (Fig. 8C), age differences accounted for 17% of the variation in shape. We classified the females into three age cate- gories: 2-3 yr, 4-9 yr and 10-16 yr old. The shape in- dices of the older age classes were normally distributed, while those of the youngest age class had a platykurtic distribution (Fig. 9). The respective mode class moved to smaller shape values from "young" to "old" females. The difference between "young" females and others is most prominent with shape indices larger than 125, the youngest females laying the most elongated eggs. In his- tograms these eggs appear as extreme values, but should not be excluded as outliers, since they represent the normal production of young birds. 4. Discussion 4.1. Determination of egg size in the Ural Owl In birds, the female component of egg size variance has generally been found to be high. It can be used to calcu- late the repeatability of egg size, which is an upper limit approximation of heritability. These generalizations emerge from numerous studies on poultry (literature e.g. in Ojanen et al. 1979, Ojanen 1983), and on wild birds representing taxonomically as diverse species as the Mallard Anas platyrhynchos (Batt and Price 1979), the Red Grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus (Moss and Watson 1982) and the Great Tit Parus major (Jones 1973, Ojanen et al. 1979, van Noordwijk et al. 1980, 1981). Egg size belongs to those ecologically important traits in which significant amounts of genetic variance often is present. For many years conclusions like this have been regarded as untenable, because of Falconer's (1960, 1981) statement that significant amounts of addi- tive variation will only be found in traits loosely con- nected with fitness. Van Noordwijk (1984) has pointed out that Falconer's dogma is an unjustified extension of "Fisher's Fundamental Theorem", and tenable only in theoretical situations not met in variable natural condi- tions. However, Gustafsson (1985) has recently found an inverse relationship between the heritability of a trait and its influence on lifetime fitness in an isolated popu- lation of the Collared Flycatcher Ficedula albicollis. It is difficult to evaluate how general this result is, especially in a bird species like the Ural Owl, which experiences fluctuating selection pressures upon its reproduction from year to year. Our data on mother-daughter pairs in the Ural Owl are too few for heritability estimation, because most of the territories were, year after year, occupied by the same females. Instead we could trace the egg size vari- ation of the same marked individuals for many years during very different breeding seasons. External factors could increase variance in egg size, as suggested by the marked variation in female weight. Rather astonishing- ly, however, a Ural Owl female always seems to lay eggs of fairly constant size. The female component of egg size rose to 80-90% in the poor and intermediate breed- ing seasons, and was about 65-75% in good years. Egg size seems, inevitably, to be a highly heritable trait also in the Ural Owl (for a general discussion of the related possible genetical biases, see Ojanen et al. 1979). 320 ORNIS SCANDINAVICA 17:4 (1986)</page><page sequence="13">Which physiological or ecological factors affect the egg size of the Ural Owl? In several bird species young females lay smaller eggs than older ones (literature in Ojanen 1983), but this was not the case in the Ural Owl. However, although the owl egg is nearly spherical, fe- male age affected egg shape: the longest eggs were laid by the youngest (2-3 yr) and the roundest by the oldest (10-16 yr) females. The average difference is so small that the shape index of eggs does not give any basis for estimating age-structure of populations, in contrast to what has been suggested in some seabirds (Coulson 1963, Coulson et al. 1969). However, a female with elongated eggs has a high probability of being a young one (cf. Fig. 9). It remains unknown whether the smaller egg diameter of first-breeders is due to higher muscular tension in their oviduct or whether it has some adaptive function. Favourable conditions (mild winters and high vole populations) increased the proportion of environmental variance in egg size in the Ural Owl. In the best year (1983) even the average egg size of most females in- creased slightly (Fig. 4); otherwise the effect of good years appeared as an increase in the interaction com- ponent of variance between females and years. Possible geographical differences in selection pres- sures operating on the egg size of the Ural Owl would rapidly evolve differences in the geographical distribu- tion of this probably highly heritable trait. Variation was indeed observed between our four subareas: mean egg size was constantly larger in areas AS and AN than in areas AW and AM (Figs 1 and 4). Because also fe- male weight and clutch size were smallest in AW and AM, the egg size differences between our study areas may be caused by geographical variation in territory quality, or by selection on a trait correlated with egg size. An additional factor of possible importance is our ignorance of the exact size of the females. Weight is not a constant morphological character, and wing length is obscured because primaries may be in use for more than one season (Pietiiinen et al. 1984). In separating ge- netic from environmental factors, experimental mani- pulations of clutches between the areas (cf. James 1983) are hardly feasible in a trait like egg size in the Ural Owl because of difficulties in tracing the experimental chicks until their first breeding. 4.2. Determination of parental investment in the Ural Owl In this section we frequently use anthropomorphic ex- pressions like 'reproductive tactics' or 'laying decision', which are rooted in the language of modern evolution- ary ecology. However, "such terms do not imply any conscious thought process by animals, and simply repre- sent a straightforward way of saying that 'natural se- lection has, over the course of time, favoured individu- als with different characteristics'. It is clearly simpler to refer to the latter as 'reproductive strategies', provided that it is understood to be a form of shorthand" (Perrins and Birkhead 1983: 4). 4.2.1. Reproductive tactics of long-lived birds in a variable environment Variation in clutch size in relation to the abundance of prey populations has been documented in many raptor and owl species (Pitelka et al. 1955, Southern 1970, Newton 1979, Mikkola 1983). Our results and those of Linkola and Myllymiki (1969) conform to this general picture. In the life of Ural Owls the succession of poorer and better breeding seasons is characteristic. The ability to adjust to prevailing conditions and to predict the quality of a breeding season is important. The popula- tions of Microtus and Clethrionomus voles are truly cy- clic in the Ural Owl's Fennoscandian range (Hansson and Henttonen 1985). This implies a fairly high degree of predictability in the availability of food. As regards clutch size, the optimal strategy would evidently be to lay eggs in the most different conditions, and to be able to adjust clutch size. Van Noordwijk et al. (1980) have proposed that yearly variation in the environment (yearly differences in selection pressures) of the Great Tit maintains genetic variation in clutch size, which is expressed in phenotypic flexibility. Ural Owl females fixed to lay only large clutches would either be able to lay every third or fourth year, or they would waste their effort in most years in laying clutches that are too large in relation to the food supply. On the other hand, fe- males laying small clutches would be able to lay in most years, but could not take full advantage of the favour- able seasons. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal variability of the food supply promotes variability in an individual's clutch size (Wooller and Coulson 1975, Perrins and Moss 1975, H6gstedt 1980), producing a continuum of optima for years and territories. Besides being able to adjust clutch size between years of different quality (Tab. 2, Fig. 3), the Ural Owls can adjust their egg size in relation to the quality of the year (Fig. 6), investing more in their eggs in favourable than in poor years. This kind of phenotypic flexibility of egg size in relation to food supply was already hinted at by Andersson (1976), when he presented data on egg weight in the Long- tailed Skua Stercorarius longicaudus. This species is also a predatory bird depending on cyclic rodent popula- tions. So far, our empirical observations are in accordance with the theoretical considerations that long-lived spe- cies utilising fluctuating resources should show be- tween-year variance in their reproductive effort in order to maximise their life-time production of offspring (Hirshfield and Tinkle 1975, Goodman 1979). Such a reproductive tactic can only evolve if there are proxi- mate controls of breeding which force the parents to adapt to prevailing conditions (Drent and Daan 1980); ORNIS SCANDINAVICA 17:4 (1986) 321</page><page sequence="14">otherwise, when they exceed their capacities the de- crease in survival to the next breeding season becomes more important (Williams 1966). Although owls are energetically very economical birds (Ricklefs 1974, Wij- nandts 1983), breeding is nevertheless a heavy task for Ural Owls, as can be seen from the pattern of their moult. The parent birds start moulting only after their young have left the nest, and they are capable of moult- ing fewer of their flight feathers as their brood size in- creases (Pietiiinen et al. 1984). 4.2.2. The necessity of body reserves When considering the breeding of the Ural Owl, we must first find the mechanism by which the date of lay- ing is determined. Perrins (1970) gave good reasons to believe that availability of food for the laying Great Tit female is of primary importance. In the Kestrel Falco tinnunculus Cav6 (1968) argued that clutch size is not directly dependent on environmental conditions, but is only indirectly influenced through the timing of laying. He proved experimentally that in better fed female Kes- trels the oocytes develop faster than in poorer fed fe- males. Jones and Ward (1976) showed explicitly the im- portance of female body reserves to laying and subse- quent clutch size in the Red-billed Quelea Quelea quelea. Similarly Newton et al. (1983) and Hirons et al. (1984) have reported a significant but temporary in- crease in the weight of female Sparrowhawks and Tawny Owls Strix aluco, respectively, during the pre- laying period. The weight increase in these species was due to deposition of extra fat and protein. Korpimaki (1981) reported a significant decrease of female weight during incubation in the Tengmalm's Owl Aegolius fu- nereus. We do not have weighings from the pre-laying period of the Ural Owl, but the evidence above suggests a similar pattern for this species. In our Ural Owl popu- lation, the median date of laying in each year varied considerably (Fig. 2), the females generally laying ear- lier in the good than in the intermediate years, and sub- stantially later in the poor breeding seasons. The asso- ciation of warm autumns with early laying dates in the next spring suggests that female condition at the time of laying is predetermined over a much longer period of time than is needed to form the eggs. The acquisition of necessary body reserves for breed- ing is further hampered by snow. In our study areas snow depth in March averages 30--50 cm, and there are practically no snow-free areas at this time. In addition to the difficulties in finding subnivean voles (Microtus and Clethrionomus), which are the most important prey species in the laying period (Lundberg 1981), their num- bers have a seasonal low in spring (Hansson 1984). The Ural Owls' level of body reserves can be seen as a consequence of general food availability, severity of the previous autumn and winter, and their own hunting abilities. During egg-formation female raptors and owls cease to hunt and rely exclusively on their mate for food, possibly in order to protect the developing egg from the risks of their hunting efforts (Newton 1979, Lundberg 1980). Thus the quality of the male is a deci- sive factor in causing variation in the female's reproduc- tive output at least in birds of prey. Moreover, Ural Owl females, as of those the Tawny Owl, are dependent on their mates hunting during the incubation and early nestling periods. 4.2.3. Date of laying - importance of the postfledging period Our observation that 72% of the variation between mean yearly clutch sizes was explained by the within- season decline in clutch size suggests that the clutch size in the Ural Owl is largely determined by the calendar date. The seasonal decline in clutch size is best under- stood in terms of changes in the female's body condition and the survival of offspring in relation to their time of gaining independence (Drent and Daan 1980). Al- though waiting for more reserves to be acquired would facilitate larger brood sizes later in the season, the shortness of the favourable season opposes this. The post-fledging period, during which mortality of young is minimal, is 2.5-3 months in the Tawny Owl (Southern 1970), a close relative of the Ural Owl. After the young have acquired independence their mortality increases heavily. It is not surprising that the time when the young become independent of their parents coincides with the seasonal peak in vole populations both in the Short- eared Owl Asio otus and the Tawny Owl (Wijnandts 1983, Hirons et al. 1984, respectively). We do not have direct observations of the post-fledg- ing period of the Ural Owl, but, since the species is larger than the Tawny Owl, it is reasonable to assume the period to be slightly longer. According to Lundberg (in litt.), Ural Owl young leave their natal territories in August. During the post-fledging phase both Tawny and Ural Owl adults undergo their moult (Hirons et al. 1984, Pietiiinen et al. 1984). The moult of the Ural Owl is severely constrained by the number of dependent young. Thus, it is important, for both the survival of young and the physical welfare of parents, to breed as early as possible. When the survival of young depends on their condition and the time of their independence (Perrins 1970), the young in late clutches survive best if there are few of them: they get more resources per bird and are in better condition at the time of subsequent dispersal in a small than in a large clutch. In addition, late in the season parental stress diminishes with feeding fewer young, and more energy is left for their own moult and preparation for the winter (on the tradeoff between moult and reproductive effort in the Ural Owl, see Pietiainen et al. 1984). 322 ORNIS SCANDINAVICA 17:4 (1986)</page><page sequence="15">4.3. On the reproductive strategy of a Ural Owl female Clutch size of the Ural Owl proved to be largely de- pendent on the date of laying, which was to a great ex- tent determined by environmental factors (autumn fa- vourability, severity of winter, food supply). Variation in egg size is mostly genetic in origin, but the results in Figs 6B and 7 suggest that also environmental effects may be important. Significant variance components in two-way ANOVAs (Tab. 9) of year and interaction ef- fects support this. We also analysed possible physiological thresholds in the decision to lay. In poor years the females which laid eggs had higher values of 'laying energy' in relation to the population mean than in more favourable breeding seasons (Fig. 3A). On this basis it would be no great surprise if the birds breeding in poor years worked as hard, or even harder, as in intermediate or good years. Given the rather predictable cyclic nature of northern small mammal populations (Hansson and Henttonen 1985), it is of interest whether the females may adapt their reproductive efforts, and especially their egg size, to the prevailing conditions or not. Here we propose two alternative explanatory hypoth- eses to account for the observed variation in egg size both between and within clutches in breeding seasons of differing quality. Hypothesis 1. Although the average territory quality (food supply) fluctuates from year to year, there are also notable differences in territory quality within years. Egg size is determined mostly by genetic factors, and environmental effects are important in determining the mean egg size only in the very best years/territories with rich food supply. Any within-clutch variation in egg size depends on the female's resources at the time of laying. Prediction: Egg size, as clutch size, should increase ac- cording to the food supply and the condition of the fe- male, and the within-clutch differences in egg size should decrease as the quality of the year increases. Hypothesis 2. Between-territory variation in food sup- ply is negligible compared with the average variation between years. Females are capable of adjusting their egg size both between and within clutches in different breeding seasons according to their own condition in re- lation to the general quality of a year. As the onset of the female's sexual activity depends much on the male's courting behaviour (Immelmann 1973, Lundberg 1980), this gives the female an indication of the phenology of that particular breeding season. The changes in the fe- male's own condition give her information on the timing of laying, and subsequently on her clutch size (Drent and Daan 1980). Prediction: Egg size should be largest in clutches where the expected productivity is greatest, and within-clutch variation in egg size should decrease as the profitability of a clutch increases. 43 - O E 2 242 _ 3 0 O rs = 0.79 42 - 3 0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 PREVALENCE OF CLUTCH SIZE Fig. 10. Egg size in different clutch sizes in poor, intermediate and good years in relation to the prevalence index. This means the ratio between the frequency of a clutch size in a year-qual- ity class and the frequency of the same clutch size in all years (the eastern study area, 1977-85, nonlayers included, H. Pie- tiiinen and H. Kolunen, unpubl.). Symbols as in Fig. 2, and clutch size written by the symbols. At present we cannot separate between the two hypoth- eses as regards the between-territory variation in food supply, because to do so we need extensive trappings of small mammals. The observation that in good years about one quarter of the females did not lay eggs (Fig. 3A) may indirectly support the first hypothesis. Unfor- tunately we do not know whether the males of the non- laying females were inexperienced territorial birds or established breeders. Male quality alone may increase variation in the female's environment. On the other hand, we can test the predictions con- cerning the between and within-clutch variation in egg size. First we must define the 'profitability' of a certain clutch size. Assuming that nestling mortality is largely independent of clutch size, the productivity of a clutch size is directly related to its frequency (see Mountford 1968). We calculated the prevalence of a clutch size as a ratio between its frequencies in a year-quality class and in 1977-85 in the eastern study area (nonlayers in- cluded, H. Pietiiinen and H. Kolunen, unpubl.). A 2-egg clutch in our study area appears to be a more profitable investment in poor years than in good years (prevalence 1.13 vs 0.75). The rationale behind our thinking is that in poor years the females laying two eggs have a competitive advantage by having a greater share of their young in the cohort, compared with the good years, when the offspring of the females laying only two eggs are swamped by other females' offspring. When we plot the mean egg size (single eggs) against prevalence, a statistically significant correlation (rs = 0.79, P &lt;0.01, N = 10) between the two variables emer- ges (Fig. 10). This result supports the second hypothesis on the basis of our argumentation that the most preva- lent clutch size is the most profitable. The intra-clutch patterns in egg size can also be ex- ORNIS SCANDINAVICA 17:4 (1986) 323</page><page sequence="16">plained by the female's ability to predict her optimal in- vestment in a particular year (Fig. 7). Due to asynchro- nous hatching the brood may be reduced through the death of the youngest offspring during periods of food shortage, although this is rather rare in the Ural Owl: about 4% of the young die before fledging (Lundberg and Westman 1984). We disagree with the classical brood reduction hypothesis (Lack 1954) in the interpre- tation of the patterns in Fig. 7. The classical hypothesis explains hatching asynchrony as an adaptation which puts the later young at a competitive disadvantage so that during food shortages they are the first to succumb. The brood reduction hypothesis says nothing of the fe- male's condition as a factor contributing to the observed investments. In our data, only 4-egg clutches agreed with intra-clutch variation in egg size as part of the brood reduction strategy (O'Connor 1978, cf. also Clark and Wilson 1981). However, we fail to see why in 3-egg clutches all eggs should be of a similar size in the inter- mediate years but show a significant decrease in the good years. On the basis of Fig. 10 we predict that females with high expectations of offspring should invest more in their later eggs, thus improving their probability of sur- vival. The pattern in Fig. 7 supports our second hypoth- esis: in 2-egg clutches the females invested more heavily in their second egg from good through intermediate to poor years. The prevalence of the 2-egg clutches in- creased in a similar manner. In 3-egg clutches the differ- ences between eggs were larger in good years than in the intermediate years. The prevalence was higher in in- termediate years. In 4-egg clutches the last two eggs were smaller than the first ones in intermediate years (note, however, the small sample size). The prevalence of 4-egg clutches was higher in good than in intermedi- ate years. At the moment we are not able to arrive at a decision in favour of either of our hypotheses, because without experimentation we depend heavily on circumstantial evidence. One of the first tasks should be to quantify the variation in food supply within and between years. The finding that environmental variance of egg size in- creased in optimal conditions seems promising for fu- ture experiments: feeding tests, transfer of eggs be- tween clutches and manipulations of clutch size. We also need careful analyses of time-energy budgets (Pianka 1976), preferentially over several seasons.
